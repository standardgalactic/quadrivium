Acknowledgments
I have enjoyed working on the fourth edition of this book, and I am thankful to the many
people who have helped in the creation of this work. First and foremost, I would like to
thank you for purchasing this book. I sincerely hope you find it as enjoyable and useful to
read as it has been to write. I would like to thank the team at Salesforce for providing me
with the Salesforce CRM product. Salesforce products are easy and fun to work with and
their solutions constantly innovate both the CRM and cloud computing industries. Next, I
would like to thank everyone at Packt who has successfully produced the completed work.
During the writing process, the team was thoroughly professional and highly supportive.
My family and friends have also been very supportive; it is only with their help, patience,
and endless cups of tea that I have been able to complete my part of this endeavor. Finally, I
would like to thank everyone who has contributed with useful feedback and suggestions.
Instead of trying to name them all and risk not mentioning others, I would like to thank all
the Salesforce employees, professionals, and keen enthusiasts who help make the Salesforce
community such a productive and collaborative environment. If you haven't participated in
Salesforce's online user communities, such as success.salesforce.com (where you can post
questions or ideas), developer.force.com, LinkedIn salesforce.com user groups, and
Twitter (look out for hash tags #salesforce and #askforce), I strongly recommend them as
they are a truly valuable place to discover and exchange information.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and
the Company Profile
Application security is always important, and even more so when the application is
delivered across a public network, such as the Internet. Salesforce.com has developed
various mechanisms to secure the platform and reduce the chances of unauthorized people
accessing your company data. This chapter describes the way login attempts to the system
are controlled and the features available to help you manage your user's access to the
Salesforce CRM application.
In this chapter, we will also look at establishing your company profile within Salesforce and
how core information, such as the details that are provided when your company first signs
up with Salesforce.com, can be managed. You will also be shown how to find your way
around the Salesforce Setup menu, and will be introduced to the settings available for the
organization-wide customization of the application's user interface along with the search
facilities offered by the Salesforce CRM application.
Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of
Salesforce CRM administration in the areas of organization setup and the global user
interface, which are covered in this chapter.
Throughout this chapter, notes and tips are provided to offer further guidance within the
given areas of functionality; and have been generated from the practical results and
experience of the Salesforce CRM system administration.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 7 ]
In this chapter, we will cover:
The Salesforce setup menu
User login and authorization
Company profiles
User interface
Search overview and settings
Questions to test your knowledge
To start with, we will look at the location and the features of the Salesforce Setup menu.
The Salesforce Setup menu
Depending upon your organization's user interface settings, you will access the Setup menu
from either the drop-down menu under your name or as a top-level setup link, as shown in
the following screenshot.
Looking at the top of the Salesforce page you should see the Setup link, as shown in the
following screenshot:
If you do not see the Setup link at the top of the Salesforce page then click on your name
and you will then see the setup option, as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 8 ]
This setting is controlled by the Enable Improved Setup User Interface setting, which is
covered later in this chapter.
As a system administrator, you will use the Setup menu so frequently that
it is recommended that you enable Improved Setup User Interface.The
Improved Setup User Interface setting is activated by default for all new
instances. Existing Salesforce instance admins should be aware that this
user interface setting determines how everyone in your organization
accesses the Setup menu.
When describing any setup steps within this book, we will begin the navigation path from
Setup. For example, to enable the Improved Setup User Interface, we will present the
navigation path as Setup | Customize | User Interface | Enable Improved Setup User
Interface.
The Setup menu appears on the left side of the page. Clicking the menu option text, (or the
drop-down icon to the left of a menu option), expands the menu where you can then select
the required menu item link; the following screenshot shows the Setup | Manage Users |
Users setup page:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 9 ]
Clicking the down arrow icon to the left of the expanded menu option collapses the menu
option. You can also expand or collapse all the menu options by clicking the Expand All or
Collapse All links as shown in the following screenshot:
To quickly find a Setup menu item, type the first few characters of the setup name in the
Quick Find search box. As you type, any options that match your search term appear in the
Setup menu. For example, to find the User Interface page, start to type user interface in
the Quick Find box as shown in the following screenshot:
We will now look at how user's login requests are verified and authorized by the Salesforce
CRM application.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 10 ]
User login and authorization
Organizations have several methods of accessing the Salesforce CRM application. Access
can be gained from the user interface (using a web browser), the API (for example, using an
integrated client application or the Apex Data Loader), a desktop client (for example,
Salesforce for Outlook), or from a mobile client application.
Whenever a login attempt is made to Salesforce using any of these methods, the user's login
request is authorized by the system using the following sequence of checks:
Does the user's profile have any login restrictions?
Does the user's IP address appear within the organization's trusted IP address
list?
Has the user been activated from this IP address before?
Does the user's web browser have a valid browser cookie from Salesforce stored?
If the user's login is from neither a trusted IP address nor a browser with a valid Salesforce
cookie, the login is denied. To gain access to Salesforce, the user's identity must be
confirmed by successfully completing the computer activation process.
Now let's look at each of these login checks in more detail.
Does the user's profile have any login
restrictions?
Login hours and IP address restrictions can be set for the user's profile. If these are set and
there are login attempts from a user outside the specified hours or from an unknown IP
address, access is denied.
Login hour restrictions
If login hour restrictions are set for the user's profile, any login attempt outside the specified
hours is denied.
To go to the Profile menu, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Profiles. Now
1.
choose a profile, select the Login Hours link, and then click Edit.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 11 ]
Set the days and hours when users with this profile can log in to Salesforce.com.
The login hours that are set are based on the default time zone of the
organization, as described later in this chapter.
Navigate to Setup | Company Profile | Company Information, click the Edit
2.
button, and select the required time zone from the Default Time Zone picklist.
The login hours that are set apply strictly to that exact time, even if a user has a
different personal time zone or if the organization's default time zone is changed.
To allow users to log in at any time, click on Clear times as shown in the
3.
following screenshot:
To prevent users from accessing the system on a specific day, (say, to carry
out internal system maintenance), set the Start Time and End Time to the
same value. For example, you could set the Start Time to 8:00 AM and End
Time to 8:00 AM (as in the Saturday and Sunday example setting in the
previous screenshot).

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 12 ]
IP address restrictions
If IP address restrictions are defined for the user's profile, any login attempt from an
unknown IP address is denied.
To restrict the range of valid IP addresses through the Profile menu, navigate to Setup |
ManageUsers | Profiles. Now choose a profile, select the Login IP Ranges link, and then
click Add IP Ranges.
Enter a valid IP address in the Start IP Address field and a higher IP address in the End IP
Address field.
The start and end addresses specify the range of IP addresses from which users can log in.
To allow a login from a single IP address, enter the same address in both fields.
For example, to allow a login from only 88.110.54.113, enter 88.110.54.113 as both the
start and end IP addresses as shown in the following screenshot:
Does the user's IP address appear within your
organization's trusted IP address list?
This check is performed if profile-based IP address restrictions are not set.
If the user's login is from an IP address listed in your organization's trusted IP address list,
the login is allowed.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 13 ]
Trusted IP range
To go to the Trusted IP range settings, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Network
Access.
Click on New and enter a valid IP address in the Start IP Address field and a higher IP
address in the End IP Address field.
The start and end addresses specify the range of IP addresses from which users can log in.
To allow a login from a single IP address, enter the same address in both fields.
For example, to allow a login from only 88.110.54.100, enter 88.110.54.105 as both the
start and end addresses as shown in the following screenshot:
Has the user been activated from this IP address
before?
Each user has a list of IP addresses from which they've been activated. If the user has
previously been activated from this IP address, then this IP address is added to the user's
personal list.
To view and remove the login IP addresses that have been recorded by your users, go to
Setup | Security Controls | Activations.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 14 ]
To remove an Activated Login IP, click the checkbox and then click the Remove button, as
shown in the following screenshot:
To remove an Activated Login IP, click the checkbox and then click the Remove button, as
shown in the screenshot above.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 15 ]
Does the user's web browser have a valid cookie
stored from Salesforce?
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when
you visit a website. Whenever you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to
recognize your web browser.
The browser will have the Salesforce cookie if the user has previously used that browser to
log in to Salesforce and has not cleared the browser cookies.
So, if the user's login is from a browser that includes a Salesforce.com cookie, the login is
allowed
Computer activation process
If the user's login is from neither a trusted IP address nor a browser with a Salesforce
cookie, the login is denied and becomes blocked, and Salesforce must verify the user's
identity.
A trusted, genuine user can access the Salesforce CRM application using the following
means:
User interface (using a web browser)
API (for example, using an integrated client application or the Apex Data Loader)
Desktop client (for example, Salesforce for Outlook)
User interface
For access through the user interface for the first time, the user is prompted to select how
they would like to receive the verification code. Here, the verification code can be received
by either an SMS text message or an e-mail message depending on whether the company-
wide SMS-based identity confirmation is enabled.
For new organizations, an SMS text message is the default method for the
computer activation process and can only be disabled by a request to
Salesforce support. For existing organizations, SMS text message
activation can be enabled by you as the system administrator, but once
enabled it requires a request to Salesforce support is required to deactivate
it.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 16 ]
SMS text message veriﬁcation code
To receive the SMS text message verification code requires the setting SMS-Based Identity
Confirmation setting to be enabled (since Spring '2014, it has been enabled by default). This
feature enables users to receive a one-time PIN delivered via SMS. This is set by navigating
to Setup | Security Controls | Session Settings and then enabling Enable SMS-Based
Identity Confirmation.
Once enabled, users must verify their mobile phone number before taking advantage of this
feature, which will present the following screenshot:
Email message veriﬁcation code
To receive an email verification code, users must have the setting Email-Based Identity
Confirmation Option enabled on their profile or included as a permission set.

The Email-Based Identity Confirmation option is only available to set if
the Enable SMS-Based Identity Confirmation option is enabled.
Once enabled, and if verification is required, users will automatically receive an activation
e-mail to the address specified in the user's Salesforce user record. Users are notified within
the Salesforce, and can enter the verification code as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 18 ]
Salesforce sends the verification code e-mail to the e-mail address associated with the user's
record in Salesforce. Here, the following screenshot shows an e-mail example:
The e-mail instructs the user to enter the verification code into the browser window, which
activates the device for verified login into the Salesforce CRM platform.
The activation code within the e-mail is valid for up to 24 hours from the time the E-mail
me a verification code button was clicked. After 24 hours, the activation link will expire
and the user must repeat the activation process.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 19 ]
Confusion can occur if your company has remote users that connect to Salesforce away
from the company network, such as from home or from public Internet connections. The
Remote users are likely to have dynamically assigned IP addresses set as their computer
identity. Because of this, whenever they attempt to log in, Salesforce will identify it as an
unknown IP address, prompt for verification, and the remote user will have to re-verify the
device.
The remote user will then have to access the e-mail associated with their Salesforce user
record to retrieve the activation e-mail, and it is here where confusion can occur. If the
remote user has to access corporate web e-mail using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
connection, the clicking of the activation link may not work because the IP address that is
being validated may now no longer be the same IP address used by the browser. This is
because the VPN connection may likely be using a web proxy.
It is recommended that you establish a policy to ensure that the user
verifies the login while connected to the VPN, or can access non-VPN-
based web mail (if this is permitted in your company) to ensure that the
validated IP addresses are the same.
(This is covered in more detail in the Session settings section in Chapter 2, Managing Users
and Controlling System Access.)
API or a desktop client
For access using the API or a desktop client (for example, using the Apex Data Loader), the
user must add their security token at the end of the password in order to log in. A security
token is an automatically generated key from Salesforce. For example, if a user's password
is pa$$word, and their security token is XXXXXX, then the user must enter
pa$$wordXXXXXX.
Users can obtain their security token by changing their password, or by resetting their
security token via the Salesforce.com user interface by navigating to Your Name | My
Settings | Personal | Reset My Security Token and then clicking on the Reset Security
Token button.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 20 ]
When a user changes their password or resets their security token, Salesforce sends a new
security token to the e-mail address associated with their Salesforce user record. The
security token is valid until a user resets their security token, changes their password, or has
their password reset by a system administrator.
Do not enter a security token within your password when accessing
Salesforce from a web browser. It is recommended that you obtain your
security token via the Salesforce user interface from a trusted network
prior to attempting access from a new IP address. When a user's password
is changed, the user's security token is automatically reset. The user will
experience a blocked login until they add the security token to the end of
their password or enter the new password after you have added their IP
address to the organization's trusted IP range.
Establishing your company profile within
Salesforce
The company profile contains core information for your organization within Salesforce,
some of which is captured during the initial system sign-up, and includes the following:
Company information and primary contact details
Default language, locale, and time zone
License information
Fiscal year settings
Currencies and exchange rates
Company information and primary contact details
When your company signs up with Salesforce, the information provided is displayed on the
Company Information page. This page can be accessed by navigating to Setup | Company
Profile | Company Information.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 21 ]
From the Company Information page, you can edit the company default localization
settings and primary contact details as shown in the following screenshot:
Default language, locale, and time zone
The company information settings for language, locale, and time zone can affect how key
data is handled for the organization.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 22 ]
However, individual users can set their own language, locale, and time zone, overriding the
organization-wide setting, by navigating to Your Name | My Settings | Personal |
Language & Time Zone as shown in the following screenshot:
Default language
This is the primary language for the organization. All interface text and online help is
displayed in this language. Individual users can, however, set their own language, which
will override the organization-wide setting.
For global organizations, it is recommended that you consider how the
setting the language impacts the user's ability to access and share
information, and whether a common language is preferred to aid
reporting and system administration. You can use the feature called
Language Settings (described later) to restrict the languages that your
users can set in their personal information language setting.
Default locale
The default locale setting affects the format of the date, date/time, and number fields.
For example, a given date in the English (United States) locale would appear as 07/27/2020,
and in the English (United Kingdom) locale as 27/07/2020.
Time in the English (United States) locale is displayed using a twelve-hour clock with AM
and PM (for example, 3:00 PM), whereas in the English (United Kingdom) locale, they
display using a twenty-four hour clock (for example, 15:00).

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 23 ]
Numbers in the English (United States) locale would be displayed as 1,000.00 and in the
German locale as 1.000,00.
However, individual users can set their own locale, which will override the organization-
wide setting.
Default time zone
This is the primary time zone in which your organization is located, for example, the head-
office location. However, individual users can set their own time zone, which will override
the organization-wide setting.
The Company Information page also displays all of the base licenses, active users, and
feature licenses that have been purchased by your organization.
License information
There are four types of licenses:
User license: A user license entitles a user to different functionality within
Salesforce and determines the profiles available to the user
Feature license: A feature license entitles a user to an additional Salesforce
feature, such as Marketing or Offline User
Permission set license: A permission set license is used to provide a user with
access to certain features that are not part of their user licenses
Usage-based entitlements: A usage-based entitlement provides periodic use of a
limited resource
Salesforce bills an organization based on the total number of licenses and
not on the number of active users.
Currencies and conversion rates
Currency settings are organization-wide within Salesforce, and can be set using either a
single currency option, using the Currency Locale setting in Company Profile, or as a
multiple currencies option where you can add currencies and set conversion rates using the
Manage Currencies link within the Company Profile section.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 24 ]
Multiple currencies can only be enabled by a request to Salesforce
customer support. When activated, the Currency Locale field and its value
are passed to a new field, Corporate Currency, also in Company Profile.
The corporate currency reflects the currency in which your company reports revenue, and is
used as the rate that all other currency conversion rates are based on. This is initially set by
Salesforce.com when the Salesforce application is activated.
All organizations, whether using single or multiple currencies, are set by default with only
one currency in the Company Profile. For single currency instances, this setting is accessed
by navigating to Setup | Company Profile | Company Information, and setting the
Currency Locale field. For multiple currencies, this is set by navigating to Setup |
Company Profile | Manage Currencies, and then clicking the Change Corporate button.
Single currency
In a single-currency organization, you set the organization-wide currency locale for your
company and your Salesforce users cannot set individual currency locales.
Multiple currencies
In a multiple-currency organization, you set the corporate currency instead of the currency
locale, and your Salesforce users can also set their individual currency by navigating to
Your Name | My Settings | Personal | Personal Information.
Multiple Currencies activation is available by a request to Salesforce
customer support.
Your Salesforce user's individual currency is used as the default currency in their own
reports, quotas, forecasts, and any records that contain currency amounts, such as
opportunities.
Currency becomes a required field on records where it has been added or
was originally defined, and so must be considered when activating the
Multiple Currencies option and then importing data or a custom object
creation.
Users can also create opportunities (and all other data records that contain currency
amounts) using any other available active currency.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 25 ]
Only active currencies can be used in currency amount fields.
Active Currencies
The list of active currencies represents the countries or regions in which your company
trades. Only an active currency can be set by you, as the system administrator on the
organization profile, or by your users on their individual user records or on data records in
the currency field.
Manage Currencies
The Manage Currencies section enables you to maintain a list of active currencies and their
conversion rates in relation to the corporate currency, and can be accessed by navigating to
Setup | Company Profile | Manage Currencies.
The Manage Currencies option appears when your organization has
enabled Multiple Currencies, currently available by request to Salesforce
customer support. Changing the conversion rates will update all existing
records with the new conversion rates, even the closed opportunities. As a
result, you will not be able to measure financial changes due to the effects
of currency fluctuations unless you have implemented Advanced
Currency Management, which stores dated exchange rates.
If multi-currency has been enabled and the currency is changed on a record using the Data
Loader, the currency amounts are converted.
The currency of records can be changed using Data Loader by updating
the standard field Currency ISO Code and setting the value to the ISO
code of the new currency. Here the ISO code is a three-letter alphanumeric
such as USD for US Dollars, EUR for Euros, GBP for British Pounds, and
so on
If multi-currency has been enabled and the currency is changed on a record using the
browser interface, the currency amounts are not converted.
The currency of records can be changed using the browser interface by
updating the currency lookup but the currency amount is not converted.
Therefore, if you change the currency of an opportunity which has a 450
EUR amount to GBP, the amount remains at 450 and is not converted to
384 GBP (which is 1 EUR = 0,852 GBP at the time of writing).

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 26 ]
Dated exchange rates
Dated exchange rates allow you to track conversion rates when an opportunity closes,
enabling the accurate reporting of opportunity-converted amounts based on the rate that
was set at the opportunity's close date. This is made possible because the historic
conversion rates are stored, and rate changes after that close date can be tracked; therefore,
reports can include the opportunity amount based on the conversion rate at the close date
instead of the rate at the time that the report is run.
Updating currency conversion rates will not change the original
opportunity amounts, only the converted amounts. Accounts and their
associated contacts must use the same default currency. Account and
contact records may be imported using active or inactive currencies.
However, importing lead records must use active currencies only.
Dated exchange rates are activated by setting the Advanced Currency Management option,
and are used for opportunities, opportunity products, opportunity product schedules,
campaign opportunity fields, and reports related to these objects and fields.
Dated exchange rates are not currently used in forecasting.
When Advanced Currency Management is first enabled, your existing exchange rates
automatically become the first set of dated exchange rates.
These exchange rates will be valid until you set another set of exchange rates by navigating
to Setup | Company Profile | Manage Currencies |Manage Dated Exchange Rates.
If you enable Advanced Currency Management, you cannot create roll-up summary fields
that calculate the currency on the opportunity object. Any existing currency-related roll-up
summary fields on the opportunity object will be disabled and their values will no longer be
calculated.
Fiscal year settings
The fiscal year settings in Salesforce can be set by navigating to Setup | Company Profile |
Fiscal Year.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 27 ]
Standard fiscal years
Fiscal year settings in Salesforce by default use the Gregorian calendar year (twelve-month
structure) starting from January 1 and ending on December 31. If your organization follows
the twelve-month structure, you can use a standard fiscal year. Standard fiscal years can
start on the first day of any month, and you can specify whether the fiscal year is named for
the starting or ending year. For example, if your fiscal year starts in April 2020 and ends in
March 2021, your fiscal year setting can be either 2020 or 2021.
Custom fiscal years
Fiscal year is more complicated than this, you can define these periods using custom fiscal
years. For example, as part of a custom fiscal year, you can create a 13-week quarter
represented by three periods of 4, 4, and 5 weeks, instead of calendar months.
If you use a fiscal year structure, such as a 4-4-5 or a 13-period structure, you can define a
fiscal year by specifying a start date and an included template. If your fiscal year structure
is not included in the templates, you can modify a template. For example, if you use three
fiscal quarters per year (a trimester) instead of four, delete or modify the quarters and
periods to meet your needs. These custom fiscal periods can be named based on your
standards. For example, a fiscal period could be called P12 or December.
Fiscal years can be modified any time you need to change their definition. For example, an
extra week could be added to synchronize a custom fiscal year with a standard calendar in a
leap year. Changes to fiscal year structure take effect immediately upon being saved.
Language settings
The Language Settings feature allows you to specify the acceptable languages that can be
used within the Salesforce CRM application.
This feature can be set by navigating to Setup | Company Profile | Language Settings.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 28 ]
You then choose the languages that you want to make available to users by selecting them
from the Available Languages pick list and then clicking on Add.
In the following example, we have addedSpanish and French along with English, and
these appear in the Displayed Languages list as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 29 ]
The languages that appear in the Displayed Languages list are now shown as available
options in the Language picklist section on the user's Personal Settings page, as shown in
the following screenshot:
User interface and supported browsers
At the time of writing there are three user interface themes. There are two classic themes,
namely Classic 2005 and Classic 2010, and there is a new theme called Lightning
Experience.
Browser support and functionality varies depending on whether Salesforce Classic or
Lightning Experience is used, and are described in more detail later on in this section.
User interface
All screenshots and setup details this book shows the Classic 2010 user interface theme.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 30 ]
The difference in the classic themes can be seen in the following screenshot, which appears
when you attempt to change from the Classic 2005 to Classic 2010:
Not only does the new user interface theme change the look and feel of Salesforce, but it
may also position some key links such as Setup and Logout under the user name for each 
user in your organization. The Classic 2010 user interface theme is only available for use by
users with supported browsers as detailed later in the Supported browsers section.
Some newer functional areas, for example Chatter (a collaboration
application suite), are dependent on the Classic 2010 and Lightning
Experience themes and cannot be provided when the Classic 2005 theme is
activated. Therefore, to enable Chatter, you must first activate the Classic
2010 theme.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 31 ]
Supported browsers
At the time of writing there are three different user interface themes namely: Salesforce
Classic 2005, Salesforce Classic 2010, and Lightning Experience. The Browser support for
these themes at the time of writing is as follows.
Salesforce Classic 2005
The following browsers are supported by Salesforce for use with Salesforce Classic 2005:
Google Chrome, most recent stable version
Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, and 11
Mozilla Firefox, most recent stable version
Apple Safari version 8.x on Mac OS X
Salesforce has discontinued browser support for Microsoft Internet
Explorer versions 7 and 8 in Salesforce Classic 2005.
Salesforce Classic 2010
The following browsers are supported by Salesforce for use with Salesforce Classic 2010:
Google Chrome, most recent stable version
Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, and 11
Mozilla Firefox, most recent stable version
Apple Safari version 8.x on Mac OS X
Salesforce has discontinued browser support for Microsoft Internet
Explorer versions 7 and 8 in Salesforce Classic 2010.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 32 ]
Lightning Experience
The following browsers are supported by Salesforce for use with Lightning Experience:
Google Chrome, most recent stable version
Microsoft Edge for Windows 10
Mozilla Firefox, most recent stable version
Apple Safari version 8.x and 9.x on Mac OS X
Salesforce will possibly redirect you to Salesforce Classic when using
Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 9-11 within Lightning Experience.
However, since the Summer '2016 release, Salesforce has stated that users
of existing organizations can continue to access Lightning Experience with
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 11 (IE11) until December 16, 2017, but
users of new organizations created after Summer '2016 will not be able to
use IE11 to access Lightning Experience, and will automatically be
redirected to Salesforce Classic.
Along with the user interface theme, there are many other aspects of the user interface that
can be set up in Salesforce to present the optimum user experience to the users in your
organization.
Additional user interface options include User Interface Settings (such as collapsible detail
page sections and inline field editing), Sidebar Settings (Collapsible Sidebar settings and
Custom Sidebar Components on All Pages), and Calendar Settings (such as Home Page
Hover Links for Events and Drag-and-Drop Editing on Calendar Views).
There are also some administrator-specific settings that can improve your users' experience
with the application located under the Setup settings. It also includes the Enhanced Page
Layout Editor and Enhanced Profile List Views Settings.
Selection of the User Interface option can be carried out by navigating to Setup |
Customize | User Interface.
The User Interface option is the final option in the Customize section on
the left-hand setup sidebar.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 33 ]
The User Interface screen is as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 34 ]
User Interface settings
In the following sections, we will look through the various User Interface settings one by
one.
Enable Collapsible Sections
Collapsible Sections enables your users to collapse or expand sections on record detail
pages using the arrow icon next to the section heading. Sections remain expanded or
collapsed until the user changes their settings for that section. Salesforce will store a
different setting for each record type if the record types have been set up as shown in the
following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 35 ]
When enabling collapsible sections, you need to ensure that the section
headings have been entered on the page layouts.
Clicking on the triangle icon toggles between showing and hiding the section, as shown in
the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 36 ]
Show Quick Create
The Show Quick Create option adds the Quick Create fields section to the sidebar on the
Record tab page to enable users to create a new record using minimal data fields, as shown
in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 37 ]
The Show Quick Create option also controls whether users can create new records from
within the Lookup dialog. With this setting enabled, users see a New button in the Lookup
dialog screen. The following example shows the creation of a new account within the
account Lookup dialog while working with an opportunity record:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 38 ]
Clicking on the New button reveals the fields that are available for creating the new record.
The option to create new records and displaying the New button in the Lookup dialog are
only available for accounts and contacts. Also, users still need the appropriate Create record
permission to enter data with Quick Create, regardless of whether the entry fields are
displayed.
Disable the Quick Create option:
The Quick Create option does not allow you to configure the data entry
screen, so any custom fields that need to be populated there will not be
included. Also, when saving records using the Quick Create option any
validation rules associated with the record are not triggered. These
features allow records to be created that do not conform with your
company's business rules and data integrity requirements so it is advisable
to disable the Quick Create option.
Enable Hover Details
The Enable Hover Details option allows users to view interactive information for a record
by hovering the mouse pointer over a link to that record in the Recent Items list on the
sidebar or in a lookup field on the record detail page. The fields displayed in the hover
details are determined by the record's mini page layout, which is set at the page layout edit
screen.
The Enable Hover Details option is selected by default.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 39 ]
In the following screenshot, we are hovering the mouse pointer over a link to a record in the
Recent Items list on the sidebar:
In the following screenshot, we are hovering the mouse pointer over a lookup field on the
record detail page:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 40 ]
To view the hover details for a record, users require the appropriate
sharing access to the record, and field level security to the fields, in the
mini page layout, which is set at the page layout edit screen (see Chapter
3, Configuring Objects and Apps).
Enable Related List Hover Links
This option enables related list hover links to be displayed at the top of standard and
custom object record detail pages. It allows users to view the related list and its records by
hovering the mouse pointer over the related list link. Users can also click on the related list
hover link to jump down directly to the Related List section without having to scroll down
the page.
The Enable Related List Hover Links option is selected by default.
Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists
This option enables the separate loading of record detail pages. First, the primary record
detail data loads, and then the related list data. This option serves to improve the display
performance for organizations with a large number of related lists on record detail pages.
When the page is loaded, the record details are displayed immediately; afterwards the
related list data loads, during which the users see a progress indicator for the related list.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 41 ]
You will see that the related list sections are not yet loaded. They appear as […] while the
primary record detail (for the account example) is loaded immediately, as shown in the
following screenshot:
After the primary record detail has loaded (the account page), the related lists are then
loaded. You can see that the number of records for the Contacts related list is now
displayed as [2].
This option does not apply to pages for which you cannot control the layout (such as user
pages or Visualforce pages).
The Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists option is disabled by
default.
Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists of External
Objects
This option is related to the setting Enable Separate Loading of Related Lists, and enables
a separate loading of record detail pages and related lists of standard and custom objects.
External objects are similar to custom objects (described in Chapter 3,
Configuring Objects and Apps), however the mapped data is not stored
inside Salesforce, so there may be delays in loading due to the availability
of the external data source and network latency. The Enable Separate
Loading of Related Lists of External Objects option is enabled by default.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 42 ]
Enable Inline Editing
This option allows users to change field values directly within the record detail page,
avoiding the need to load the record edit page first. By double-clicking on the field to be
edited within the detail page, the field changes to become editable. The new value can then
be entered and saved, or the action can be undone using the Undo button.
First, the field is highlighted by hovering over it with the mouse to reveal the pencil icon
indicating that the field is editable, as follows:
Double-clicking the field causes the field to switch from View mode to Edit mode to allow a
new value to be entered, as follows:
After a new value has been entered, the value is displayed in orange text and the user has
the option of undoing the change using the Undo button, as follows:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 43 ]
The changed value and the detail page can then be saved in the standard way using the
Save button, as follows:
To check if inline editing is enabled for your organization, and to discover
which value can be edited, you can hover over a value with your mouse
and note the result. A field that is editable will have a pencil icon to the far
right of the value when the mouse is hovered over it. A field which is non-
editable will have a padlock icon to the far right of the value when the
mouse is hovered over it.
This option is enabled by default. Certain fields cannot be changed using inline editing,
such as System Fields (created by, last modified by, and so on), Calculated Fields (formula,
auto number, roll-up summary, and so on), Read-Only Fields, and Special Fields (such as
owner and record type).
Also, fields on detail pages for documents and forecasts are not currently
editable using inline editing.
Enable Enhanced Lists
This option provides the user with the ability to view, customize, and edit list data, which is
the resulting data section that is rendered from Views. When enabled along with the Enable
Inline Editing setting, users can also edit records directly within the list without having to
move away from the page, as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 44 ]
With enhanced lists enabled, users can perform the following actions:
Create a new view, or edit, delete, or refresh the existing view.
Navigate through list results by clicking the first, previous, next, and last page
links at the bottom of the list. You can jump directly to a specific page by entering
a number in the textbox in the lower-right corner. You can also change the width
of a column by dragging the right side of the column heading with the mouse.
Changes made to column widths apply to that specific list only and are recalled
whenever that list is viewed. Please note that, when columns are added or
removed from a list, any column width settings for that list is discarded.
Change the order in which a column is displayed by dragging the entire column
heading with your mouse to the desired position. For your users who have
permission to edit the list definition, the changes are saved for all who see the list.
For your users without permission to edit the list definition, their changes are
discarded after leaving the page.
If inline editing is enabled for your organization, values can be entered directly
into the list by double-clicking on individual field values. Users who have been
granted the Mass Edit from Lists option on their profile can edit up to 200
records at a time.
The Mass Edit from Lists option only appears on the profile if inline editing is
enabled.
A mass edit is performed by first selecting the records to be edited using the checkboxes
and then clicking on one of the fields to be edited.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 45 ]
Upon clicking on the field, a new pop-up window is displayed asking whether the change
is to be applied to just the selected record or to all records that have been selected. In the
following screenshot, we see an example where two account records have been selected,
and where one of the record's billing street fields has been clicked.
This feature only allows mass edits; users cannot mass-delete:
Remind users that they cannot mass delete records:
As a system administrator, you may need to remind users that they cannot
mass delete records as occasionally users may try to mass delete using the
only visible Delete link, which is, in fact, the link to delete the View as
shown in the following screenshot. Communicating this fact will hopefully
save you from having to recreate any views that have been deleted in
error.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 46 ]
On the Account, Contact, and Lead List views, there is an Open Calendar link at the
bottom of the page to display a weekly view of a calendar underneath the list. A record can
be dragged from the list to a time slot on the calendar to create an event associated with the
record.
To perform inline editing on an enhanced list, the Advanced Filter options
must be turned off in the list view filter criteria. Some standard fields do
not support inline editing. For example, Case Status, Opportunity Stage,
and several of the Task and Event fields can only be edited from the
record edit page.
The number of records displayed can be changed per page by setting the view to 10, 25, 50,
100, or 200 records at a time. When this setting is changed, navigation is set to the first page
of the list results, as shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 47 ]
If users change the number of records to be displayed per page, that setting is applied to all
the lists (not just the current list).
Also, if the option of displaying 200 records is selected, a warning message appears, as it
can reduce performance, as shown in the following screenshot:
Enable the Salesforce Classic 2010 user interface theme
At the time of writing there are three different user interface themes, namely Salesforce
Classic 2005, Salesforce Classic 2010, and Lightning Experience.
Enabling the Salesforce Classic 2010 user interface theme activates the most recent version
of Salesforce Classic, the interface theme that predates Lightning Experience. Disabling this
option activates the Salesforce Classic 2005 user interface theme.
There are features, such as Chatter, that require the Salesforce Classic 2010
user interface theme, and disabling this option disables Chatter in
Salesforce Classic and also in Lightning Experience.

Enable Tab Bar Organizer
The Tab Bar Organizer automatically arranges user's tabs in the tab bar to control the width
of the CRM application pages and prevent horizontal scrolling. It dynamically measures
how many application tabs can be displayed, and puts tabs that extend beyond the
browser's current width into a drop-down list displayed on the right-hand side of the tab
bar, as shown in the following screenshot:
This setting is only enabled when the New User Interface Theme is
activated. If your organization is not using the New User Interface Theme,
you can enable the feature, but the Tab Bar Organizer will not be activated
for your users until the new theme is also enabled.
Enable Printable List Views
This option allows users to easily print list views.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 49 ]
If this is enabled, users can click on the Printable View link (the printer logo) located in the
top-right corner on any list view to open a new browser window. Within the new window,
the current list view is displayed in a print-ready format, as shown in the following
screenshot:
This option allows users to click on the Printable View link from any list view, which opens
a new browser window displaying the current list view in a print-ready format.
Enable Customization of Chatter User Profile Pages
This option allows you to customize the tabs on the Chatter user profile. The way to
customize Chatter user profile pages is described in detail later in Chapter 8, Introducing
Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM. In the following
example screenshot, we have customized the Chatter user profile page tabs and added the
Learning Zone tab, which results in the following modified page:

The Winter' 2014 release saw this feature being automatically enabled.
This enables you to add custom tabs or remove default tabs such as the default Feed and
Overview tabs. Custom tabs are available by customizing Subtab Apps, which are
described in more detail in Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps. If this option is
disabled, users only see the default Feed and Overview tabs.
Enable Salesforce Notification Banner
When this option is selected, an announcement banner appears on certain pages.
Released as part of the Summer '2014 release, the Salesforce Notification

accounts, contacts, and dashboards.
Your users can prevent the banner from appearing on all pages by clicking the Close
button, or you can prevent the Salesforce Notification Banner from appearing across your
entire organization by disabling this option.
Disable Lightning Experience IE11 Support
Deprecation Notification
Since the Summer '2016 release, Salesforce has stated that existing organizations can
continue to use Microsoft Internet Explorer version 11 (IE11) to access Lightning Experience
until December 16, 2017 (after this date, users will be automatically redirected to Salesforce
Classic).

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 51 ]
The Disable Lightning Experience IE11 Support Deprecation Notification option enables
you to prevent screen notifications from appearing when users in your organization access
Lightning Experience-activated Salesforce, to cater for your own strategy for transitioning 
browser use away from IE11. See the Supported browsers section earlier in this chapter for
more information.
Sidebar
The following options are available to help users view and edit information on the sidebar,
which is presented in the left hand, vertical section of the screen:
Enable Collapsible Sidebar
Show Custom Sidebar Components on All Pages
We will now cover the sidebar options in detail.
Enable Collapsible Sidebar
The collapsible sidebar gives users the ability to show or hide the sidebar on every
Salesforce page where the sidebar is included. When this option is selected, the collapsible
sidebar becomes available to all users in your organization. However, each user can set their
own preference for displaying the sidebar. Users can set the sidebar to be permanently
displayed or they can collapse the sidebar and show it only when needed.
Show Custom Sidebar Components on All Pages
If you have custom home page layouts that include components in the sidebar, this option
displays the sidebar components on all pages in Salesforce and for all users. If only certain
profiles are allowed to view sidebar components on all pages, you can assign a Show
Custom Sidebar on All Pages permission to just those profiles.
If the Show Custom Sidebar Components on All Pages user interface
setting is enabled, the Show Custom Sidebar on All Pages permission is
not available within the profile permissions.

Calendar settings
The following options are available to help users view and edit information on calendar
sections and views:
Enable Home Page Hover Links for Events
Enable Drag-And-Drop Editing on Calendar Views
Enable Click-And-Create Events on Calendar Views
Enable Drag-And-Drop Scheduling on List Views
Enable Hover Links for My Tasks List
Let us see what they are in detail.
Enable Home Page Hover Links for Events
This option enables hover links in the calendar section of the Home tab, and allows users to
hover the mouse over the subject of an event to see interactive information for that event.
This setting controls the Home tab only, as hover links are always
displayed in other calendar views. Also, this option is enabled by default.
Enable Drag-And-Drop Editing on Calendar Views
This option enables your users to drag and drop existing events around their daily and
weekly calendar views to reschedule events without having to navigate from the page to
the event creation page. Loading performance of the calendar control may suffer with this
option enabled. Drag-and-drop editing is not available for either multi-day events or on
console calendar views. Also, this option is enabled by default.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 53 ]
Enable Click-And-Create Events on Calendar Views
This option enables the creation of events on daily and weekly calendar views by double-
clicking on a specific time slot and entering the details of the event in an interactive section.
The fields presented in the interactive section are set using the mini page layout on the
Event page layout screen.
Recurring events and multi-person events cannot be created using the
Enable Click-And-Create Events On Calendar Views option.
Enable Drag-And-Drop Scheduling on List Views
This option enables users to create events by dragging the record to be linked from the list
view onto the weekly calendar view. Upon dropping, an interactive section for the event
detail is displayed where the fields available are set using the mini page layout.
This option is disabled by default.
Enable Hover Links for My Tasks List
This option enables hover links for tasks in the My Tasks section of the Home tab and on
the calendar day view, and allows users to hover the mouse over details of the task in an
interactive section.
Name settings
The Name settings feature allows additional fields to be accessed for person objects in
Salesforce in order to help avoid confusion when two person records have identical first
and last names.

Enable Streaming API
This option enables the use of the Force.com Streaming API in your organization. The
Streaming API provides near real-time streams of data from the Force.com platform. You
can create topics to which applications can subscribe and receive asynchronous notifications
of changes to data in Force.com.
See the Force.com Streaming API Developer's Guide at
developer.salesforce.com for more details.
Enable Dynamic Streaming Channel Creation
This option is a feature of the Streaming API; when enabled, it results in the dynamic
creation of streaming channels when clients subscribe (if the channel has yet to be created).
This setting is enabled by default.
Enable Set Audit Fields upon Record Creation and
Update Records with Inactive Owners User Permissions
This option allows you to set audit fields (such as record creation date) that are read-only by
default when records are created using the Salesforce API. you can create records through
using tools such as the Data Loader, which is a client application that makes use of the
Salesforce API. This setting also allows you to update records that have inactive owners.
Available since the Winter '16 release, this setting makes it easier to
migrate historic data to Salesforce and mass-update records not owned by
active users. Previously, you needed to contact Salesforce Support to
temporarily allow these features. When this option is enabled, it results in
two new System Permissions being available in Profiles and Permission
Sets that can be assigned to users.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 62 ]
Enable Custom Object Truncate
Select the Enable Custom Object Truncate checkbox to activate truncating custom objects,
which permanently removes all of the records from a custom object while keeping the
object and its metadata intact for future use.
When this option is enabled, a Truncate button appears in the list of edit
buttons within the custom object setup page.
Truncating custom objects is a quick way to permanently delete all of the records from a
custom object. Take the example of a custom object that has been created and filled with test
records. When testing is complete and the test data is no longer required, you can truncate
the object to remove the test records, but keep the object ready to be deployed into
production. This is much quicker than batch-deleting records and having to recreate the
custom object.
Truncating a custom object permanently removes all of its records, and
you cannot recover the records from the Recycle Bin. A copy of the
truncated object appears in the Deleted Objects list for 15 days, during
which the object and its records continue to count towards the
organization's data limits. The copied object and its records are then
permanently deleted after 15 days.
Enable Improved Setup User Interface
When the Improved Setup User Interface is enabled in an organization, you might notice
several differences from the original user interface.
The Setup menu is accessed from the Setup link in the upper-right corner of any Salesforce
page. It is arranged into the following goal-based categories:
Administer, Build, Deploy, Monitor, and Checkout.
Personal settings, which all Salesforce users can edit, are available from a
separate My Settings menu.
By enabling the Enable Improved Setup User Interface option, the
Improved Setup User Interface is activated for every user in your
organization.

[ 63 ]
Enable Advanced Setup search
When enabled, this option allows you to search for Setup pages, custom profiles,
permission sets, public groups, roles, and users from the sidebar search textbox within the
Setup area. When the option is disabled, you can search for Setup pages only.
As you type in the sidebar Setup search box, any options that match your search term
appear in the Setup menu. When you press Enter, you will be presented with a page listing
any matching permission sets, custom profiles, public groups, roles, or users.
Advanced settings
Advanced settings provides the activation of two features: activation of Extended Mail
Merge and the option to Always save Extended Mail Merge documents to the Documents
tab.
Activate Extended Mail Merge
This option enables the Mass Mail Merge link to be available in the Tools area on the home
pages for accounts, contacts, and leads.
When enabled, this option also sets single mail merges requested from the Activity History-
related list on a record to be created with the Extended Mail Merge function. The
Extended Mail Merge function is activated using a wizard comprising the following
steps:
In the Tools area, click Mass Mail Merge to start the mass mail merge wizard.
1.
Choose a list view from the View drop-down list and select the records to include
in the mail merge. Selecting the checkbox in the column header will select all
records currently displayed on the page.
Select the types of Word documents to be generated from the multiple selections

of documents, envelopes, and labels. Select the optional Log an Activity checkbox
to log the creation of these mail merge documents, which adds a completed task
to each record.
Select the appropriate mail merge templates. For documents, choose whether to
3.
create one Word document that includes all output or a separate Word document
for each record. Click the optional Preview Template button to review the pre-
loaded mail merge template.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 64 ]
Although the document preview is editable, do not edit it in Word as the changes will not
be saved to your current mail merge request. You have to make a new mail merge template
and upload this first.
With Extended Mail Merge, the mail merge operation cannot exceed 1,000
records, the selected mail merge template(s) total size cannot be greater
than 1 MB, and the number of records multiplied by the combined size of
the mail merge templates cannot be greater than 50 MB. Also, Extended
Mail Merge is available by request from Salesforce customer support.
Always Save Extended Mail Merge Documents to the
Documents tab
This option stops the sending of the mail merge documents as e-mail attachments, instead
storing them in the user's personal documents folder on the Documents tab. Users are still
sent e-mails as confirmation when their mail merge requests have completed, and these e-
mails contain links to the documents in the Documents tab.
These documents count against your organization's storage limits.
Search overview and settings
Salesforce.com uses custom algorithms that consider the following within searches:
The search terms
Ignored words in search terms (for example, the, to, and for)
Search term stems (for example, searching for speaking returns items with speak)
Proximity of search terms in a record
Record ownership and most recently accessed records

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 65 ]
A user might not, therefore, have the same search results as another user performing the
same search because searches are configured for the user performing the search. For
example, if another user recently viewed a record, the record relevancy increases, and the
record moves higher in their search results list. Records that are owned by the user also
move higher in their search results. There are currently three types of search, as follows:
Sidebar search
Advanced search
Global search
Let's see what they are, shall we?
Sidebar Search
From the Sidebar Search box, users can search a subset of record types and fields.
If Global Search is enabled (described later in this section), Sidebar
Search is disabled.
Wildcards and filters can be used to help refine the search.
A wildcard is a special character or token that can be used to substitute for
any other character or characters in a string. For example, the asterisk
character (*) is used to substitute zero or more characters. More
information about wildcard characters can be found using the following
link: h t t p ://e n . w i k i p e d i a . o r g /w i k i /W i l d c a r d _ c h a r a c t e r .
Advanced Search
Advanced Search in the sidebar allows searching for a subset of record types in
combination and offers more fields including custom fields and long text fields, such as
descriptions, notes, tasks, and event comments. Wildcards and filters can be used to help
refine the search.
If Global Search is enabled (described later in this section), Advanced
Search is disabled.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 66 ]
Global Search
From the Global Search box, users can search more types of records, including articles,
documents, products, solutions, Chatter feeds, and groups. Users can also search more
fields, including custom fields and long text fields, such as descriptions, notes, tasks, and
event comments. Wildcards and filters can be used to help refine the search.
To enable Global Search, you must enable Chatter. If Global Search is
enabled, Sidebar Search and Advanced Search are disabled. Global
Search is not supported in Partner Portal or Customer Portal. Only users
with supported browsers can use Global Search, as it has indirect
dependencies on the new theme user interface.
Searching in Salesforce.com
Your search term must have two or more characters. Special characters, such as ", ?, *, (,
and ) are not included in the character count. For example, a search for m* will fail to return
any search results.
Search terms are not case-sensitive. For example, a search for martin returns the same
results as the search for Martin.
Finding phone numbers can be done by entering part or all of a number. For example, to
find (512) 757-6000, enter 5127576000, 757, or 6000. To search for the last seven digits,
you must enter the punctuation, such as 757-6000.
In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, you can find a person by entering the last name before
the first name; searching for howard trevor returns any person named Trevor Howard.
If you're using Advanced Search or Global Search, refine your search
using operators such as AND, OR, and AND NOT. If you're using
Advanced Search or Global Search, search for exact phrases by selecting
the Exact Phrase checkbox, or by putting quotation marks around multiple
keywords; for example, "phone martin brown" returns results with
phone martin brown, but not martin brown phoned or phone martina
browning.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 67 ]
If you're using Sidebar Search, your search string is automatically treated
as a phrase search. Search for partially matching terms using wildcards as
follows:
Asterisks match one or more characters at the middle or end (not the
beginning) of your search term. For example, a search for brown* finds
items that start with variations of the term brown, such as browning or
brownlow. A search for ma* brown finds items with martin brown or
mandy brown. If you're using Sidebar Search, an asterisk (*) is
automatically appended at the end of the search string
If you're using Global Search, question marks match only one character in
the middle (not the beginning or end) of your search term. For example, a
search for ti?a finds items with the term tina or tika, but not tia or tinas.
Fields on custom objects are only searched if you have added a custom tab
for the object.
If using Sidebar Search or Advanced Search, question marks match only
one character in the middle or end (not the beginning) of your search term.
Search settings
There are various search options that can be customized to change the way information can
be searched by your users in Salesforce. These options either present enhanced search
features that are visible as a part of the user interface, or are invisible and used to optimize
searching behind the scenes. The Search settings can be set by navigating to Setup |
Customize | Search | Search Settings.
The following screenshot shows the search settings that are available if Chatter is not
activated in your Salesforce CRM application:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 68 ]
By activating Chatter, the Global Search setting is automatically enabled and provides the
following reduced set of options:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 69 ]
In the following sections, you will see how to work with various search settings:
Enable “Limit to Items I Own” Search Checkbox
The Limit to Items I Own option allows your users to restrict the search results to find only
the records of which they are the record owner when searching in the sidebar.
The Limit to Items I Own checkbox that is available for Advanced Search
is always displayed, regardless of this option setting.
Enable Document Content Search
This option allows users to perform a full text search of a document. When new documents
are uploaded or an existing document is updated, its contents are available as search terms
to retrieve the document.
Enable Search Optimization if your content is mostly in
Japanese, Chinese, or Korean
This option optimizes searching for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean language sets. It affects
Sidebar Search and the account search for Find Duplicates on a lead record in Sidebar
Search and Global Search.
This option should not be selected if you expect content and searches to be
mostly in other languages.
Use recently viewed user records for Blank and Auto-
Complete Lookups
This option causes the list of records returned from a user autocomplete lookup and from a
blank user lookup to be generated from the user's recently viewed user records. By not
enabling this option, the dialog shows a list of recently accessed user records from across
your organization.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 70 ]
Enable drop-down list for Sidebar Search
This option creates a drop-down list in the Search section to appears, which allows users to
limit searches by the type of record.
Enable English-Only Spell Correction for Knowledge
Search
This option is used with the Articles and Article Management tabs, in the Articles tool in
Case Feed, and in the Salesforce Knowledge sidebar in the Salesforce console.
This setting applies only to article searches via the API and not to article
searches when using the Global Search.
When enabled, any search suggest, and searches for alternate spellings of English search
terms.
Enable Sidebar Search Auto-Complete
This option provides the functionality whereby, users start typing search terms, the Sidebar
Search displays a matching list of recently viewed records.
The Global Search feature includes autocomplete as a standard feature and
does not require a specific autocomplete option to be set.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 71 ]
Enable Single-Search-Result Shortcut
This option allows users to skip the search results page and navigate directly to the Record
Detail page if their search produces a single result.
Number of Search Results Displayed Per Object
The Number of Search Results Displayed Per Object option allows you to configure the
number of items that are returned for each object in the Search Results page. The current
setting is in brackets next to each object where the new value must be between 5 and 50.
Lookup Settings
The Lookup Settings section of the Search Settings page allows you to enable enhanced
Lookups and lookup auto completion for Accounts, Contacts, Users, and Custom objects.
Enhanced lookups
Enhanced Lookups provides an enhanced interface for your users to sort and filter search
results by any field that is available in regular search results, as shown in the following
screenshot:

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 72 ]
With Enhanced Lookups enabled, users can hide and reorganize the columns that are
displayed in the results window. Enhanced Lookups returns all records that match the
search criteria, and allow you to page through large sets of search results.
After enabling Enhanced Lookups, you must specify which fields users can use to filter
lookup search dialog results. This is set by accessing search layouts and choosing the fields
from the Lookup Dialog Fields layout.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 73 ]
For custom objects, this is done by navigating to Setup | Create | Objects. Choose the
object you want to modify, scroll down to the Search Layouts-related list, and choose the
fields from the Lookup Dialog Fields.
For Accounts, Contacts, or Users, this is done by navigating to Setup | Customize, then
going to Accounts, Contacts, or Users, and then Search Layouts. Then, choose fields from
Lookup Dialog Fields, as shown in the following screenshot:
Currently, only Accounts, Contacts, Events, Users, Chatter objects, and custom objects can 
use the enhanced lookup settings.
Lookup Auto-Completion
When theLookup Auto-Completion option is enabled, your users are shown a dynamic list
of matching, recently used records when they edit a lookup field.
At the time of writing, this feature is only available for Accounts,
Contacts, Events, Chatter, Users, and custom object lookups.

Questions to test your knowledge
You will now be presented with questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration (in the organization setup and global user interface areas) that have been
covered in this chapter. The answers can be found at the end of the chapter.
Questions
We present four questions to verify your understanding of the user login and authentication
mechanism, company profiles, fiscal years, and the user interface.
Question 1 – user login and authentication
A new field-based salesperson has joined WidgetsXYZ and started using Salesforce for the
first time. You are the administrator at WidgetsXYZ, and the salesperson is telling you that
they are always prompted to activate their laptop and always use the same browser. How
would you respond? (Select all that apply).
a) Verify that the Trusted IP Ranges for Salesforce have been configured correctly.
b) Verify that Login hour restrictions for Salesforce have been configured.
c) Verify that browser cookies are being stored on the salesperson's laptop correctly.
d) Explain to the salesperson that this is normal behavior and that the laptop is responding
as expected.
Question 2 – company profile
Which settings can be modified for individual users? (Select all that apply)
a) Currency
b) Search settings
c) Language
d) Locale
e) User Interface

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 75 ]
Question 3 – fiscal years
The WidgetsXYZ company has 13-week fiscal quarters made up of 4, 4, and 5 weeks instead
of calendar months. What can you do to enable reports to capture activity for the correct
quarter? (Select one)
a) Modify the reports to filter dates using these weekly periods.
b) Modify the Standard Fiscal Year for these weekly periods.
c) Enable Custom Fiscal Years to capture these weekly periods and revert back to Standard
Fiscal Years if necessary.
d) Enable Custom Fiscal Years to capture these weekly periods and be aware that you
cannot revert to Standard Fiscal Years.
Question 4 – user interface
Which settings can be modified in the Salesforce user interface? (Select all that apply)
a) Language settings.
b) Hover details.
c) Time zone settings.
d) Enhanced list views.
e) Enable Printable List Views.
Answers
Here are the answers to the four questions about user login and authentication mechanism,
the company profile, fiscal years, and the user interface.

Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile
[ 76 ]
Answer 1 – user login and authentication
The answer is a) Verify that the Trusted IP Ranges for Salesforce have been configured
correctly. Salesforce stores a cookie in the browser and activates that device, and prevents
the user from being prompted for an activation code when they log in from different IP
addresses. If the user has blocked cookies or is deleting them in the browser they would
experience this behavior.
Answer 2 – company profile
The answers are a) Currency, c) language, and d) Locale. They can be modified for
individual users.
b) User interface and e) Search settings cannot be modified for individual users as they are
global setting affecting all users.
Default locale, language, and currency are set on the company profile, but these setting can
be overridden for users with the values that are set at an individual level.
Answer 3 – fiscal years
The answer is d) Enable Custom Fiscal Years to capture these weekly periods and be aware
that you cannot revert to Standard Fiscal Years.
Enabling custom fiscal years is not reversible and you cannot revert to standard fiscal years.
You can, however, set custom fiscal years to mirror the standard fiscal year. Because fiscal
quarter is based on weekly periods and not months, Standard Fiscal Years cannot
accommodate reporting, which is why Custom Fiscal Years are required.
Answer 4 – user interface
The answers are c) Hover details, d) Enhanced list views, and e) Enable Printable List
Views. These are all settings within the user interface and affect all users when set.
a) Language settings and c) Time zone settings are specified on the company profile, where
they provide the default values; however, users can override these and set them on their
personal settings.

Summary
This chapter looked at the mechanisms in place to help manage login access to the
Salesforce CRM application and how organization-wide settings can be set to determine
your company-specific information within Salesforce.com.
We also looked at the options to set up and configure the look and feel of the application,
along with details of the methods used to search for information in Salesforce.
Notes and tips gained from the experience of Salesforce CRM system administration were
outlined to help guide and improve the implementation and understanding of these
features.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the areas of organization setup and the global user interface.
Having looked at these core customization feature sets, we will now look at how profiles
and sharing in Salesforce CRM govern what functionality and access permissions a user has
throughout the application.

Managing Users and
Controlling System Access
In the previous chapter, we looked at user authentication and how user login access is
authorized by the Salesforce application. We were introduced to the concept of a user being
assigned a profile that could be set to control certain permissions. The user profile login
permissions we looked at were restrictions on login hours and IP addresses, which allow
you to control when, and from where, users log in to the Salesforce application.
In this chapter, we will look at how users can be managed in more detail and understand
how some of the key profile settings are used within the Salesforce CRM application.
We will start to look into the ways in which a user's profile controls both access to objects
and also governs what features are available to that user.
Along with profiles, this chapter also begins to look at the concept of record sharing and
provides a high-level look at sharing features within Salesforce. It also describes how these
features control access to records for users.
Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of
Salesforce CRM administration in the area of user setup, which is covered in this chapter.

Introduction to record ownership, profiles,
and sharing
Before looking at the features available to manage users, we start with a brief introduction
to the concepts of record owner, profiles, and sharing in Salesforce CRM.
Record owner
The terminology record owner is reflected throughout Salesforce and for each and every
data record there can be one, and only one, record owner.
Only users that are active in Salesforce can have records assigned to them.
When a user is marked inactive in Salesforce CRM, he/she no longer has access to the
application. However, any records that this inactive user owns remain in the application
and continue to show the inactive user as the record owner.
The record owner setting generally determines if access to that record is available to other
users within the organization, and is enabled using either profile or sharing settings.
Profiles and sharing
Profiles, sharing, and the optional role hierarchy setting work together and should be
considered as a whole when setting up record ownership and data access for users. An
overview of the relationship between users, profiles, and the sharing settings can be
pictured as follows:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 80 ]
All users in Salesforce must be assigned a profile. The profile is a control mechanism used
to determine which functions the user can perform, which types of data they can access,
and which operations they can carry out on that data.
All users are associated with sharing mechanisms in Salesforce, which determine the actual
records the user can access. Controlling the level of record access can be achieved using
options ranging from default sharing, which is set at the organization level, to role
hierarchy and beyond using advanced sharing mechanisms. A user does not have to be
assigned to a role in Salesforce.
The sharing rules are briefly outlined as follows and covered in far more detail later in this
book.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 81 ]
Profiles
Some of the key controls of the profile are to identify the type of license specified for the
user, any login hours or IP address restrictions, and control access to objects. If the
appropriate object-level permission is not set on the user's profile, the user will be unable to
access the records of that object type in the application.
Profiles never override your organization's sharing model or role hierarchy. For example, a
profile may be set to allow a user access to create, edit, and delete leads. However, a user
with this profile cannot edit or delete other user's leads if your organization's lead sharing
model is read-only.
In Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps, we will look in detail at the features that the
profile controls, which includes tabs, object-level security, field-level security,
Apex/Visualforce page accessibility, console layout, application selections, and
administrative and general user permissions.
There are two types of profile in Salesforce: standard and custom, with each standard or
custom profile belonging to exactly one user license type.
Standard profiles and custom profiles are similar in nature, the difference being that for
standard profiles, the following types of settings cannot be applied: administrative
permissions, general user permissions, and object-level permissions, plus, notably, the
password never expires setting, which means you are not required to change your
password after a certain amount of time (this is a part of the password policies, which are
described later). Hence, you must either create a custom profile or use a permission set,
(described later in this chapter), if you want to enable any of those features.
There are a number of standard profile types such as:
Contract manager
Marketing user
Solution manager
Standard user
System administrator
Contract manager
The contract manager profile is generally used to manage contracts and override forecasts.

[ 82 ]
Marketing user
The marketing user profile is generally used to manage campaigns, import leads, and
manage public documents. Users with this profile have access to the same functions as
standard user profiles.
Solution manager
The solution manager profile is generally used to publish and review solutions. Users with
this profile have access to the same functions as standard user profiles.
Standard user
The standard user profile is used to create and edit the main types of records. This profile
also allows users to run reports and view the organization's setup. Notably, this profile can
view, but not manage, campaigns. This profile can create, but cannot review solutions.
System administrator
The system administrator profile is used to configure and customize the application. Users
with this profile has access to all functionality that does not require any additional licenses.
For example, system administrators cannot manage campaigns unless they also have a
marketing user license.
Standard profiles have their uses, but it is wise to limit the cloning of them
to create custom profiles as it has been known for Salesforce to change the
settings for standard profiles when a new release is rolled out, which can
result in an undesired outcome for any user assigned with that profile.
Sharing
Sharing settings control the default access for each object across the organization. Sharing
rules per object can grant access beyond the default sharing settings; they cannot restrict
access. The default sharing settings are as follows:
Controlled by Parent
Private
Public Read Only
Public Read/Write

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 83 ]
Public Read/Write/Transfer
Public Full Access
Grant Access Using Hierarchies
When the Grant Access Using Hierarchies setting is enabled, the role of the record owner
determines visibility throughout the organization. Users in higher roles in the hierarchy will
have full access (view/edit/delete) to all records owned by those at a lower level in the role
hierarchy.
If Grant Access Using Hierarchies is not enabled, all roles are treated equally regardless of
the hierarchy.
Grant Access Using Hierarchies is only applicable for custom objects
since they cannot be disabled for standard objects.
Roles
Roles are the principal elements in sharing rules. Users can be grouped into roles based
upon their need of access to data, according to how they fit into the role hierarchy. Creating
a role for every user's job title is not required.
Roles are accessed throughout the application and are particularly important for reporting.
For instance, if you have two departments, Operations and Sales, you can run comparative
reports on both roles.
Roles generally report to another role and are used to maintain the role hierarchy. It is a
one-to-many hierarchical relationship with the hierarchy, allowing managers to see the data
of the users that report to them. Users at any given role level are always able to view, edit,
and report on all data owned by, or shared with, users below them in the hierarchy.
You can create up to 500 roles for your organization.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 84 ]
Role hierarchies do not need to specifically match your organization chart. Instead, each
role in the hierarchy should represent a level of data access required by users.
Permission Sets
Permission sets allow you to further control access to the system for the users in your
organization. They can be considered as a method to fine-tune the permissions for selected
individuals and enable access in a similar way to the setting up of profiles.
Permission Sets allow you to grant further access but not restrict or deny
access.
While an individual user can have only one profile, you can assign multiple permissions
and permission sets to users. For example, you can create a permission called Convert
Leads that provides the facility for converting and transferring the leads and assign it to a
user who has a profile, which does not provide lead conversion. You can create a
permission called Edit Contacts and assign it to a user who has a profile that does not
provide contact editing. You can also group these permissions into a permission set to
create specific profile-like permissions without actually having to create or clone complete
profiles, which are often unnecessary.
You can create up to 1,000 permission sets for your organization.
Permission Sets are an ideal mechanism to apply system access for your users without
affecting all other users that have the same profile and without having to create one-off
profiles, which sometimes lead to an increase in the amount of maintenance.
A common use for Permission Sets is to grant additional permissions in addition to the
settings listed in a profile to individuals without changing their profile. For example, to
provide more rights than their profile currently allows.
Creating Permission Sets
To create (or clone) Permission Sets, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Permission Sets.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 85 ]
When you clone an existing permission set, the new permission set has the
same user license and enabled permissions as the permission set it is
cloned from.
To create a new Permission Sets click on New as shown in the following screenshot:
Now enter a Label, API Name, and Description.
If you plan to assign the permission set to users that all have the same type
of user license, a best practice is to associate that user license with the
permission set. However, if you plan to assign the permission set to users
that currently have different licenses (or may have different licenses in the
future), it is probably best to create an organization-wide permission set.
To continue creating the permission set (as outlined previously), either select a User License
or select the option None (to create an organization-wide permission set). Now finally, click
on Save as shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 86 ]
When you clone an existing permission set, the new permission set has the
same user license and enabled permissions as the permission set it is
cloned from.
Profile and permission sets summary
Generally, permissions and access settings can be specified for users at profile level and at
individual user permission set level. Although certain permissions and access settings can
only be specified in profiles. A summary of the permission and settings types that are
available in Profiles and Permission Sets can be seen in the following table:

Managing users in Salesforce CRM
All users in your organization with access to Salesforce CRM require a username, an e-mail
address, a password, and a profile along with an active user license.
Depending on the features your organization has purchased, you may have user options
such as Marketing, Service Cloud, and Mobile, which give particular users the ability to
access other features that are only available with a specific user license. A user can be
assigned to one or more of these options.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 88 ]
You can also create and manage other types of users outside your organization by applying
the appropriate licenses that provide limited access to your Salesforce organization, as
detailed later in this chapter.
In association with the user license, you can govern all user's access to data using the
options available in either the profile settings or the sharing features.
Profile settings control access to applications and objects while sharing features control
access to specific records.
To navigate to the user detail page, go to Setup | Manage Users | Users.
The user detail page shows a list of all the users in your organization as well as any portal
users:
To show a filtered list of users, select a predefined list from the View drop-down list or
click on Create New View to define your own custom view.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 89 ]
For example, you can create a view with search criteria of Last Login, less than, LAST 28
DAYS to show all users that have not logged in for 28 days as shown in the following
screenshot:
As the system administrator of Salesforce CRM, you can perform various user management
actions such as creating new users, resetting passwords, and even delegating user
administration tasks to other users within your organization. The following list of user
actions will be covered:
Creating new users
Viewing and editing user information
Password management

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 90 ]
Session management
Logging in as another user
Creating custom user fields
Creating new user records
The steps for creating a new user are as following:
Click on New User.
1.
Enter fields in the General Information and Locale Settings sections.
2.
Check the box, Generate new password and notify user immediately.
3.
Save the new user details.
4.
To create a new user for your organization, navigate to the user detail page. This page
displays the list of all the users in your organization. To navigate to the New User page, go
to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now click on the New User button.
Looking at the top section of the page, you will see the General Information section as
shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 91 ]
The mandatory user information is shown with a bar and requires the entry of the user's
Last Name, Email address, Username, User License, and Profile.
The length of user's passwords cannot exceed 16,000 bytes.
The e-mail address automatically becomes the username, but you can change it if you
require prior to saving.
You can restrict the domain names of user's e-mail addresses to a list of
values such as xxx@WidgetsXYZ.com, yyy@CompanyXYZ.com, and so on.
After which, attempts to set a user's e-mail address to an unlisted domain
(such as xxx@MyNonCompanyWebMail.com) will result in an error.
The feature for restricting the domain names of user's e-mail addresses can only be enabled
by request to Salesforce customer support. Also, when selecting a user license, note that
some further options become unavailable depending on the license type you choose. For
example, the Marketing User and Allow Forecasting options are not available for
Force.com user licenses because the Forecasts and Campaigns tabs are not available to
users with that license.
You should consider the username that is entered. After the username is
saved, it becomes a unique setting throughout the Salesforce.com
universe, hence you will not be able to use that same username in any
other Salesforce CRM organization.
You can select various checkboxes that give the user additional features or options. The
types of additional features are available by selecting one or more of the following example
checkboxes:
Marketing User
Offline User
Knowledge User
Force.com Flow User
Service Cloud User
Site.com Publisher User
Salesforce CRM Content User

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 92 ]
You will not be able to select these features if they are not supported by your user license
type. Also, you will be unable to save the new user record if you do not have any remaining
licenses available for these features.
At the bottom of the New User edit page, there are further sections, which include the
Locale Settings section as shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 93 ]
Saving new user records
Complete the required information, which is displayed with a bar, and then check the
Generate new password and notify user immediately checkbox and save the details by
clicking on the Save button. Upon saving, the user's login name and a temporary password
are e-mailed via Salesforce.com to the new user.
Junk e-mail folder
If you have generated the new password to be sent, but the new user
cannot see the e-mail notification from Salesforce.com in his/her inbox
you may need to have the user check his/her junk e-mail folder.
The following table lists the key standard user fields with the required fields shown in bold:

Viewing new user records
After saving the User Edit page, you are presented with the details page for the user where
you can view the information that was entered as shown in the following screenshot:
Do not overwrite active or inactive user records with new user data:
Salesforce does not recommend overwriting inactive user records with
new user data. Doing so prevents you from tracking the history of past
users and the records associated with them.
There are also situations where you may feel it appropriate to recycle an active user record,
but it is better to deactivate users when they are no longer using Salesforce and create a new
record for each new user.
A typical real-world example of recycling a user record, and one to avoid, is sometimes
encountered when a sales team is organized into sales territories.
The sales team user records in Salesforce are stamped with a territory indicator and any
account records that are located in their particular territory are assigned to the user record
(set as the record owner). In this way, the user record simply acts as a container for the
territory.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 95 ]
Managing user records in this way results in both audit and maintenance issues. For
example, if Tina Fox changes sales territory, her personal information (username, password,
e-mail address, phone number, and so on) all has to be transferred to a new user record
requiring Tina to reactivate a new password, re-enter both her personal details, and all her
personal preferences in the Salesforce application.
The issue worsens if the user record (or territory) that Tina is reassigning to, is held by, say,
Timothy Little as he would also need to reset his personal details.
This approach leads to a technically complex method of territory reassignment and a very
disappointing user experience for your sales team. Fortunately, Salesforce provides features
such as criteria-based sharing rules, sales teams, and territory management to better
manage the organization of sales territories.
Adding multiple users
If you have several users to add, you can add more than one at a time.
To add multiple users, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now click on the Add
Multiple Users button.
This is a two-step process: First you select the user license type and then you are presented
with multiple sections to add the new user's details. As you can see in the following
screenshot, this can be a quick method for creating users, since not all required fields have
to be entered in this process:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 96 ]
If, however, after the initial saving of multiple user records, you attempt to edit a user
record, via the user edit screen, you will be prompted to fill up all mandatory fields.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 97 ]
Delegation of user management
If you have an organization with a large number of users or a complex role hierarchy, you
can delegate aspects of user administration to users who are not assigned to the system
administrator profile.
This allows you to focus on tasks other than managing users for every department or
structure that your company has within Salesforce. This provides further benefits for global
organizations that encounter time zone and cultural differences as it allows a user based in
that region with local knowledge to create the users, which saves time and results in a better
user experience.
For example, you may want to allow the manager of the Asia Pacific Operations team to
create and edit users in the Asia Pacific Operations Team Leader role and all subordinate
roles.
There are currently two options for providing this delegated user management access:
Create a profile with the Manage Users permission
Use delegated administration
Creating a profile with the Manage Users
permission
This option is not recommended and should be very carefully considered as it allows a
much greater range of system administration functions to be carried out by the user.
In addition to creating and managing users, the Manage Users permission also allows the
user to perform the following:
Expire all passwords
Clone, edit, or delete profiles
Edit or delete sharing settings
Edit user login hours

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 98 ]
By providing users with the Manage Users permission, as you can see, there are many other
permissions that are switched on, which introduces security risks.
Using delegated administration
Delegated administration is a more secure method for providing delegated user
management access as it allows you to assign limited administrative privileges to the
selected non-administrator users in your organization.
Delegated administrators can perform the following tasks:
Creating and editing users, and resetting passwords for users in specified roles
and all subordinate roles
Assigning users to specified profiles
Logging in as another user
To create delegated groups, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Delegated
Administration. Now click on the New button or select the name of an existing delegated
administration group. The following screenshot shows the Manage Delegated Groups
page:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 99 ]
Here is the screenshot for the existing group that has been named User Management:
The Delegated Administrators section allows you to select and add the users that are to be
given the delegated administration permission.
The User Administration section allows you to select and add roles which the delegated
administrators can assign to the users they create and edit. They can assign users for the
stated roles and all subordinated roles.
The Assignable Profiles section allows you to select and add profiles which the delegated
administrators can assign to the users they create and edit.
The Assignable Permission Sets section allows you to select and add Permission Sets
which the delegated administrators can assign to the users they create and edit.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 100 ]
The Assignable Public Groups section allows you to select and add Public Groups which
the delegated administrators can assign to the users they create and edit.
To enforce security, profiles with the Modify All Data permission (such as the System
Administrator profile) cannot be assigned by a delegated administrator. See the following
example message shown when attempting to allow the delegated administrator to assign
the System Administrator profile:
If a user is a member of more than one delegated administration group, be
aware that he/she can assign any of the assignable profiles to any of the
users in roles he/she can manage.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 101 ]
Select the Enable Group for Login Access option, if you want to allow delegated
administrators in this group to log in as users who have granted login access to their
administrators and are in the roles selected for the delegated administrator group.
To look at how users can grant login access to their administrators, refer to the section
Logging in as another user toward the end of this chapter.
Agreement in using active user licenses by delegated user
administrators:
If you have established delegated user management in your organization,
you will need to have some agreement between yourself and the delegated
user administrators about how many of the available licenses can be used
for each area of the organization. You cannot automatically limit the
number of active users that can be created by users with these
permissions.
Viewing and editing user information
To view or edit user information, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now, click on
Edit next to a user's name. Change the necessary information and click on Save.
Users can also change, or add to, their own personal information after they log in.
If you change a user's e-mail address and do not select the Generate new password and
notify user immediately option, a confirmation message will be sent to the new e-mail
address that you entered to verify the change of e-mail. The user must click on the link
provided in that message for the new e-mail address to take effect.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 102 ]
If you change a user's e-mail and reset the password for a user at the same time, the new
password is automatically sent to the user's new e-mail address, and e-mail verification is
not required.
Click on Unlock to unlock a user that is locked out of Salesforce.
The Unlock button is only available when a user is locked out after they
have exceeded the maximum number of incorrect password login
attempts.
Searching for users
You can use the search features (described in the previous chapter) to search for any user in
your organization, regardless of the user's status. However, when using a lookup dialog
from fields within records, the search results return active users only.
Deactivating users
You cannot remove users from the system, but you can deactivate their records so that they
can no longer access the application.
To deactivate users, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now, click on Edit next to a
user's name, disable the Active checkbox, and then click on Save.
If the user is a member of account, sales, or case teams, you are prompted to remove the
user from those teams:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 103 ]
When deactivating users, there are some considerations that ought to be made, such as:
Deactivating users with Run as specified user dependencies set on dashboards
causes those dashboards to stop displaying. Each dashboard has a running user,
whose security settings determine which data to display in a dashboard. You
need to reassign Run as specified user to an active user with the appropriate
permissions.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile, in
the License information section, Salesforce bills an organization based on the total
number of licenses and not on active users.
If Chatter is enabled and a user who has been included in either the Following or
Followers list is deactivated and the user is removed from the list, however,
he/she is restored to the lists if he/she is re-activated.
Deactivating users that have been explicitly included as part of an
approval process, which is described in Chapter 7, Implementing Business
Processes in Salesforce CRM, will cause the approval step to fail.
Freezing user accounts
This feature allows you to freeze user records. Often there are times when you may not
want to deactivate a user immediately (such as when a user is part of an approval process)
but you must prevent them from logging into your organization (as they have left the
company, for example) while you perform the steps to deactivate them.
To freeze a user record, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now, click on a user's
name to access their user detail page. Now click the Freeze button.
Password management
You have the following options for resetting passwords for users in Salesforce CRM:
Resetting passwords
Expiring passwords

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 104 ]
Resetting passwords
If users have forgotten their password, they can click on the Forgot your password? link on
the Salesforce CRM login page which presents them with a screen to enter their username,
as shown in the following screenshot:
The user will then receive an e-mail from Salesforce that contains a new password link that
will require them to answer a previously set security question such as Where were you
born? before their password is reset and they can log in to Salesforce.
To reset a user's password, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now select the
checkbox next to the user's name.
Optionally, to change the passwords for all currently displayed users, check the box in the
column header to select all rows.
Click on Reset Password to have a new password e-mailed to the user(s).
After you reset user's passwords, some users may need to re-activate their
computers to successfully log in to Salesforce (see the previous chapter).

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 105 ]
Expiring passwords
You can expire passwords for all users at any time to enforce extra security for your
organization. After you expire passwords, users may need to activate their computers to
successfully log in to Salesforce (see the previous chapter).
This includes system administrators if they don't have Password Never
Expires on their profile (or permission set), however, the standard System
Administrator profile has the Password Never Expires setting activated
by default.
To expire passwords for all users, except those with the Password Never Expires
permission, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Expire All Passwords. Now, select the
Expire all user passwords checkbox and then click on Save.
The next time each user logs in, he/she will be prompted to reset their password.
After you expire passwords, some users may need to reactivate their
computers to successfully log in to Salesforce (see the previous chapter).
Controlling system access
Salesforce provides several features to allow you to control user's access to your instance of
Salesforce CRM. Here we are going to look at the key control mechanisms and access
policies that are available for you to set.
Password policies
There are several password and login policy features that help you to improve your
organization's security. To set these password policies, navigate to Setup | Security
Controls | Password Policies. Select the required settings and then click on Save.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 106 ]
Let's look at each of the password policies which are shown in the following screenshot:
User passwords expiration period
Password expiration periods for all users in your organization are set by the picklist
selection User passwords expire in.
This sets the length of time until all user passwords expire and must be changed. Users with
the Password Never Expires permission are not affected by this setting.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 107 ]
The options are 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, One Year, and Never
Expires.
Enforce password history
This setting is used to remember user's previous passwords so that they must always enter
a previously unused password. Password history is not saved until you set this value. You
cannot select the No passwords remembered option unless you select the Never expires
option for the User passwords expire in field.
The options are either No passwords remembered or a number between 1
and 24 passwords remembered.
Minimum password length
This sets the minimum number of characters required for a password. When you set this
value, existing users are not affected until the next time they change their passwords.
A numeric value can be set between 5 and 50 characters.
Password complexity requirement
This sets a restriction on which types of characters must be used in a user's password. The
following options are available:
No Restriction: This option does not have any requirements to create a password
Must mix alpha and numeric: This option requires at least one alphabetic
character and one number

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 108 ]
Must mix alpha, numeric and special characters: This option requires at least
one alphabetic character, one number, and one of the following characters: ! # $ %
– _ = + < >
Must mix numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters: This option requires at
least one number, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter
Must mix numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters:
This option requires at least one number, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase
letter, and one of the following characters: ! # $ % – _ = + < >
The Must mix alpha and numeric option is the default option.
Password question requirement
This setting requires that a user's answer to the password hint question does not contain the
password itself.
The options are either Cannot contain password, which means that the
answer to the password hint question cannot contain the actual password
itself; or None, which is the default, for no restrictions on the answer.
Maximum invalid login attempts
This sets the number of incorrect login attempts allowed by a user before they become
locked out. The options are No limit, 3, 5, and 10.
The default number of invalid login attempts is 10.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 109 ]
Lockout effective period
This sets the duration of the login lockout. The options are 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60
minutes, and Forever (must be reset by admin).
The default lockout effective period is 15 minutes.
If a user becomes locked out, he/she can either wait until the lockout effective period
expires or you can view the user's information and click on Unlock. The Unlock button is
only displayed when a user is locked out.
Obscure secret answer for password resets
This hides the text as users type the answers to security questions. The default option is
unchecked which will display the answer in plain text when users answer a security
question, say when resetting their passwords.
Require a minimum one day password lifetime
When selected, this option prevents users from changing their passwords more than once
per day. The default option is unchecked which allows users to change their password as
often as they like.
Forgot Password or Locked Account Assistance
The following sections discuss the available options:
Message
By setting this message, the text will appear in the lockout e-mail that users receive
whenever they need you to reset their password. Your users will also see the message text
in the confirm identity screen and e-mail that they receive whenever their password is reset.
This is useful to add your contact details and a personal message.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 110 ]
Help link
Setting this link results in the text above this option appearing as a web URL, which when
clicked will allow your users to navigate to a separate page such as a custom help page,
which you have available.
API only user settings
The following section discusses the available option:
Alternative Home Page
API Only Users will be redirected to this URL after they have confirmed a user
management change (such as resetting a password). This would be used as a way of
confirming the change since users with the profile or permission set setting of API Only
User cannot access Salesforce via the user interface and hence receive no visual
confirmation.
Session management
There are several session security features that help you improve your organization's
security. These features include setting the session expiration timeout, locking sessions to
the IP address from which they originated, and other organization-wide session settings. To
set these session options, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Session Settings.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 111 ]
Select the required settings as shown in the following screenshot and then click Save.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 112 ]
Let's look at each of the session security features.
Session timeout
There are various features for setting the session timeout as per the following sections:
Timeout value
This sets the length of time after which inactive users are automatically logged out of the
system.
The options are between 15 minutes and 12 hours.As a system
administrator you need to balance the requirements for user satisfaction
and enforcement of security controls, however it is recommended that you
choose as short a timeout period as possible to protect sensitive
information and enforce stricter security.
The value of the last active session is not updated until halfway through the timeout period.
So if you have a 2-hour timeout, the system does not check for activity until 1 hour has
passed. As an example, say you have a 2-hour timeout value. If you update a record after 30
minutes, the last active session value is not updated because there was no activity after 1
hour and hence you will still be logged out in a further 1 hour and 30 minutes because the
last active session has not been updated.
Disable session timeout warning popup
This sets whether inactive users are presented with a timeout warning message. Users are
warned 30 seconds before the session timeout as set by the Timeout value.
Force logout on session timeout
Enabling this option causes inactive users to have their browsers refreshed and set to the
Salesforce.com login page when the session times out.
It is recommended that you do not select the Disable session timeout
warning popup when enabling the Force logout on session timeout
feature as this can confuse users when they are logged out for no apparent
reason.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 113 ]
Session settings
There are various features for setting the session as per the following sections.
Lock sessions to the IP address from which they
originated
This option is used to specify if users' sessions are to be locked to the IP address with which
they logged in.
Enabling this option helps to prevent the hijacking of valid user sessions
by unauthorized people.
Lock sessions to the domain in which they were
first used
This setting associates user's current session with a specific domain to prevent unauthorized
use of that session ID in another domain.
This setting applied to user's logins via the user interface and is enabled by
default for new organizations starting from the Spring '15 release.
Require secure connections (HTTPS)
This sets whether HTTPS (instead of the less secure HTTP connection) is required to access
Salesforce.
This option is enabled by default and can only be disabled by request to
Salesforce.com support.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 114 ]
Force relogin after Login-As-User
This option, when set, results in you having to log in again to get back into Salesforce after
logging out as a logged-in user. When this is not set you are given the original session after
logging out as the logged-in user and do not have to re-login.
This option is enabled by default for new organizations since the Summer
'14 release.
Require HttpOnly attribute
Setting this option restricts access to the session ID cookies. The effect of this is that cookies
with the HttpOnly attribute are not accessible using non-HTTP calls such as JavaScript
methods from custom or packaged applications.
Setting this will result in custom or packaged applications that use
JavaScript to call session ID cookies that no longer work as they are denied
access to the session cookie.
Use POST requests for cross-domain sessions
This option sets the organization to send session information using a POST request, instead
of a GET request, during cross-domain exchanges, such as when calling a Visualforce page
which is served on a different URL to the standard Salesforce CRM pages.
POST requests are more secure than GET requests, in this scenario since the
session information in the body of the request.

[ 115 ]
Enforce login IP ranges on every request
This setting affects users with profiles that have login IP restrictions which allow only IP
addresses within the Login IP Ranges setting to access Salesforce.
If the setting is not set, login IP ranges are verified only when the user logs into Salesforce.
When this setting is enabled, login IP ranges are enforced on each and every page request.
Caching
The feature for setting login page caching and autocomplete which stores, user's login
details (just the list of usernames but not the password) is as per the following sections.
Enable caching and autocomplete on login page
Setting this option enables user's browsers to store username text and so, after their initial
log in, usernames are automatically set in the User Name field on the login page.
This option is enabled by default.
Enable secure and persistent browser caching to
improve performance
This option activates data caching in the browser which is secure and helps to improve page
reload performance (by avoiding extra round trips to the server).
Salesforce recommends setting this option and is enabled by default.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 116 ]
Enable user switching
The user switcher feature allows users that have multiple usernames on the same or
different Salesforce instances to switch between their different usernames. By selecting their
profile picture, they can view all the available usernames that can be navigated to.
This option hides or shows the user switcher when users select their profile picture.
Deselecting this option hides the user switcher and also hides your Salesforce instance from
appearing in user switchers in other instances.
This setting is enabled by default, however it is available in Lightning
Experience only. In addition, the Enable caching and autocomplete on
login page settings must be enabled.
Remember Me until logout
Usernames are cached if a user selects the Remember Me checkbox or while a session is
active. However, the Remember Me checkbox is not available when logging in using
SingleSignOn (SSO). Therefore, when the session expires, the username no longer appears
in the login screen or the user switcher.
By enabling this option, the cached usernames are only deleted once the user specifically
logs out. Should the session time out, then the username remains on the user switcher, but
is set as inactive.
This option is disabled by default. Salesforce recommends enabling this
option as it is helpful for users.
Identity verification
The feature for setting identify confirmation, which allows further mechanisms to extend
the standard use of e-mail confirmation, is as per the following sections

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 117 ]
Enable the SMS method of identity verification
This option enables users to receive a one-time PIN which they receive via SMS. Once
enabled, users must verify their mobile phone number before taking advantage of this
feature.
This option is enabled by default and can only be disabled by request to
salesforce.com support.
Require security tokens for API logins from
callouts (API version 31.0 and earlier)
In API version 31.0 and earlier, security tokens for API logins from callouts (such as Apex or
AJAX proxy callouts) are required.
In API version 32.0 and later, security tokens for API logins from Apex
callouts, AJAX proxy callouts, and so on, are required by default
Allow location-based automated verifications
with Salesforce Authenticator
This option allows you to disable the use of location-based automated verifications for users
utilizing the Salesforce Authenticator mobile app. When enabled users are allowed to verify
their identity by automatically approving notifications in Salesforce Authenticator (within
trusted locations such as a home or office).
This option for automated verification from all locations is enabled by
default

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 118 ]
Allow only from trusted IP addresses
This option allows you to specify that automated verification from locations using the
Salesforce Authenticator mobile app is only permitted from trusted IP addresses.
Lightning Login
Lightning Login is an enhanced security mechanism that moved beyong using passwords.
The feature allows users to click their username, tap to approve the notification on their
mobile devices, and authenticate with their fingerprint or PIN.
Allow Lightning Login
This option enables or disables the Lightning Login feature for verifying their identity in
Salesforce CRM.
This option is enabled by default and the feature is supported for use in
Salesforce Classic as well as Lightning Experience.
Clickjack protection
Clickjacking is a malicious technique that tricks a user into clicking on a button or link to a
different page than the one the user intended and often takes the form of embedded code or
script that executes without the user's knowledge. There are various features for setting
clickjack protection as per the following sections

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 119 ]
Enable clickjack protection for setup pages
This option adds security to help guard against clickjack attacks on Salesforce setup pages.
This option is enabled by default and can only be disabled by request to
salesforce.com support.
Enable clickjack protection for non-setup
Salesforce pages
This option adds security to help guard against clickjack attacks on non-setup Salesforce
pages.
This option is enabled by default and can only be disabled by request to
Salesforce.com support.
Enable clickjack protection for customer
Visualforce pages with standard headers
This option protects against clickjack attacks on Visualforce pages with headers enabled.
Enable clickjack protection for customer
Visualforce pages with headers disabled
This option protects against clickjack attacks on Visualforce pages with headers disabled
(such as the value of showHeader="false" on the page tag).

[ 120 ]
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
protection
Cross–Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a malicious technique in which unauthorized
commands are crafted (by script or a link on a page, for example) to be sent by a user to a
website that has been authenticated.
These options protect against Cross–Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by modifying the
non-setup pages to include a random string of characters in the URL parameters or as a
hidden embedded field. The system then verifies this string of characters and only executes
the command if the value matches the expected value. There are various features for setting
protection against CSRF attacks as per the following sections:
Enable CSRF protection on GET requests on non-
setup pages
The Enable CSRF protection on GET requests on non-setup pages option protects against
CSRF attacks on GET requests on non-setup pages.
This option is enabled by default and can only be disabled by request to Salesforce.com
support.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 121 ]
Enable CSRF protection on POST requests on
non-setup pages
The Enable CSRF protection on POST requests on non-setup pages option protects
against CSRF attacks on POST requests on non-setup pages.
This option is enabled by default and can only be disabled by request to Salesforce.com
support.
Content Security Policy protection
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard created to prevent malicious content
executing in trusted web content. Setting the option within this section applies the policy to
associated e-mail templates within Salesforce.
Session security levels
Session-level security settings are used for connected apps, reports, and dashboards. Here
you can restrict access to these areas of functionality based on the level of security
associated with the authentication (login) method for the user's current session. You can
restrict access to connected apps, reports, and dashboards by setting the level of security
associated with the user's current authentication (login) method; each login method has one
of two security levels which is either Standard or High Assurance. Different authentication
methods are assigned with the following security levels:
Username Password (Standard)
Delegated Authentication (Standard)
Activation (Standard)
Two-Factor Authentication (High Assurance)
Authentication Provider (Standard)
Lightning Login (Standard)

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 122 ]
To change the security level associated with a login method navigate to Setup | Security
Controls | Session Settings. Locate the Session Security Levels, select the login method
and then click the Add or Remove arrow to move it to the required category as shown in
the following screenshot:
Logout page settings
The Logout URL setting allows you to specify a URL that starts with http:// or https://
that users are redirected to after they have logged out of Salesforce. If the Logout URL is not
specified, the user is redirected to https://login.salesforce.com. If My Domain is
enabled and Logout URL is not specified, users are redirected to
https://"my-domain".my.salesforce.com.
Logging in as another user
To assist other users, you can log in to Salesforce as another user.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 123 ]
To log in as another user, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Users. Now click on the
Login link next to the user record as shown in the following screenshot:
You can also log in as another user from the User Detail page using the Login button as
shown in the following screenshot:
After you have logged in as another user, you will notice a message at the top-right corner
of all Salesforce pages that display the message You are currently logged in as.
To return to your administrator account, click on the logged in user's name (the user who
has granted you access, Trevor Howard in this example). Then click on the Logout option:
Regardless of the login access policy, whenever an administrator logs in as
another user, the login and logout events are recorded in the setup audit
trail.

Creating a guide to help users grant login
access to you
There are many occasions when it is useful for you to log in as one of the users in your
organization. This could be, say, to check data access from their role or profile or to check
reports or dashboards and so on.
If the Administrators Can Log in as Any User feature is disabled, rather than instructing
individuals one-by-one, on how to grant you login access you can save time for both
yourself and the users in your organization by preparing a how-to guide to help users grant
login access to you. The following is a sample how-to guide that lists the steps that they
need to take to make the required setting and is shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 125 ]
When the Administrators Can Log in as Any User feature is enabled, users will no longer
have the option to grant login access to administrators, but they can still grant login access
to Salesforce.com support.
Where additional apps have been installed, the list of entities that users can select to grant
access may increase. For example, if your organization has installed the Non Profit Starter
Pack app published by the Salesforce.com Foundation (see h t t p ://w w w . s a l e s f o r c e f o u n d a
t i o n . o r g /n o n p r o f i t s t a r t e r p a c k ), you will see the option to grant access to this
organization's support team as shown in the following screenshot:
Creating custom user fields
You can create custom fields for users and set custom links that appear on the user detail
page. To navigate to the user field's page, go to Setup | Customize | Users | Fields and
then scroll down to the User Custom Fields section:

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 126 ]
The User object can be considered a special object in Salesforce as there are restrictions on
what can be configured. For example, there can be only one record type and page layout for
the User object.
Salesforce.com Health Check
The Health Check feature enables you to view the key security settings in your
organization, such as login access policies, password policies, and so on, and compare these
settings to the security standards recommended by Salesforce.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 127 ]
To access the Health Check settings, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Health Check
where you will be presented with a page as shown in the following screenshot:
The Health Check page displays actual, and Salesforce recommended, values for the
following security controls: Login Access Policies; Network Access; Password Policies;
Remote Site Settings; Session Settings.
Within the page, High-Risk and Medium-Risk settings are shown with details about how
they compare against the Salesforce recommended (standard) values. Links are provided
within this screen so you can modify any of the given security settings along with a
summary health check score that shows how your instance compares to the standard
baseline recommended by Salesforce.

Managing Users and Controlling System Access
[ 128 ]
Health Check Score
If all the values in your setting groups meet or exceed the standard, your total score is
shown as 100% and the settings that meet the standard are listed at the bottom of the page.
If you choose to change security settings, you can then click the Refresh button, (shown at
the top right of the page), to update your score. Some settings have a higher impact on your
score. For example, the Minimum Password Length is weighted heavier so a value that
does not compare favorably with the standard baseline recommended by Salesforce will
reduce the Health Check Score.
The Health Check score is a proprietary Salesforce calculation that
measures your security settings against the Salesforce Baseline standard.
The settings in your organization that are deemed at risk lower your score
and the settings that meet or exceed the standard increase the score.

The following table shows the setting and risk values that meet the Salesforce Baseline
standard.

Summary
In this chapter, we described the features for managing users within Salesforce CRM.
We were introduced to the concepts of record ownership, profiles, and sharing, and
discussed how these concepts are used to control the application and record permissions for
users in depth.
We looked at how user information can be accessed and the mechanisms for managing
user's passwords and the options for setting session security along with the features in the
Salesforce Health Check.
We discussed other features to help with the administration of users using features such as
granting login access to administrators and enabling delegated user administration.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the areas of user setup.
In the next chapter, we will look at the mechanisms for controlling access to data and the
features that provide data management and record sharing in detail.

Configuring Objects and Apps
In Chapter 1, Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company Profile and Chapter 2, Managing
Users and Controlling System Access, we were introduced to the profile feature in Salesforce,
which is a controlling mechanism. Profiles are used to determine the functions users can
perform, what types of data they can access, and what operations they can carry out on that
data.
In this chapter, we will describe the Salesforce CRM record storage features and
customizable user interface in detail, such as objects, fields, and page layouts. In addition,
we will see an overview of the relationship that exists between the profile and these
customizable features that the profile controls.
This chapter looks at the methods for configuring and tailoring the application to suit the
way your company information can be best represented within the Salesforce CRM
application. We will look at the mechanisms that allow data to be grouped and presented
within the application by looking at apps, tabs, page layouts, record types, related lists, and
list views.
Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of
Salesforce CRM administration in the area of Standard and Custom Objects which are
covered in this chapter.

The relationship between a profile and the
features that it controls
The following diagram describes the relationship that exists between a profile and the
features that it controls:
The profile is used to:
Control access to the type of license specified for the user and any login hours or
IP address restrictions that are set. This was covered in detail in Chapter 1,
Setting up Salesforce CRM and the Company profile.
Control access to objects and records using the role and sharing model. If the
appropriate object-level permission is not set on the user's profile, then the user
will be unable to gain access to the records of that object type in the application.
This was introduced in Chapter 2, Managing Users and Controlling System Access,
and will be covered in detail in Chapter 4, Securing Access to Data and Data
Validation.
In this chapter, we will look at the configurable elements that are set in conjunction with a
profile. These are used to control the structure and the user interface for the Salesforce CRM
application.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 137 ]
Objects
Objects are a key element in Salesforce CRM as they provide a structure for storing data and
are incorporated in the interface, allowing users to interact with the data.
Similar in nature to a database table, objects have properties such as:
Fields, which are similar in concept to a database column
Records, which are similar in concept to a database row
Relationships with other objects
Optional tabs, which are user-interface components to display the object data
Standard objects
Salesforce provides standard objects in the Salesforce CRM platform by default. Standard
objects that are available include Account, Contact, and Opportunity. Standard objects are
described in more detail later in this chapter.
In addition to the standard objects, you can create custom objects and custom tabs.
Custom objects
Custom objects are the tables you create to store your data. You can create a custom object
to store data specific to your organization. Once you have the custom objects and have
created records for these objects, you can also create reports and dashboards based on the
record data in your custom object.
Fields
Fields in Salesforce are similar in concept to a database column; they store the data for the
object records. An object record is analogous to a row in a database table.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 138 ]
Standard fields
Standard fields are predefined fields that are included as standard within the Salesforce
CRM application. Standard fields cannot be deleted but non-required standard fields can be
removed from page layouts whenever necessary.
With standard fields, you can customize visual elements that are associated with the field,
such as field labels and field-level help, as well as certain data definitions such as picklist
values, the formatting of auto-number fields (which are used as unique identifiers for the
records), and setting of field history tracking. Some aspects, however, such as the field
name, cannot be customized and some standard fields (such as Opportunity Probability)
do not allow the changing of the field label.
Custom fields
Custom fields are unique to your business needs and can not only be added and amended,
but also deleted. Creating custom fields allow you to store the information that is necessary
for your organization.
Both standard and custom fields can be customized to include custom help text to help
users understand how to use the field:

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 139 ]
Object relationships
Object relationships can be set on both standard and custom objects and are used to define
how records in one object relate to records in another object. Accounts, for example, can
have a one-to-many relationship with opportunities; these relationships are presented in the
application as related lists.
Apps
An app in Salesforce is a container for all the objects, tabs, processes, and services associated
with a business function.
There are standard and custom apps that are accessed using the App menu located at the
top-right corner of the Salesforce page, as shown in the following screenshot:

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 140 ]
When users select an app from the App menu, their screen changes to present the objects
associated with that app. For example, when switching from an app that contains the
Campaign tab to one that does not, the Campaign tab no longer appears. This feature is
applied to both standard and custom apps.
Standard apps
Salesforce provides standard apps such as Call Center, Community, Content, Marketing,
Sales, Salesforce Chatter, and Site.com.
Custom apps
A custom app can optionally include a custom logo. Both standard and custom apps consist
of a name, a description, and an ordered list of tabs.
Subtab apps
A Subtab app is used to specify the tabs that appear on the Chatter profile page. Subtab
apps can include both default and custom tabs. This is described in more detail in the
Salesforce Chatter section later in Chapter 8, Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and
Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM.
Tabs
A tab is a user-interface element that, when clicked on, displays data or activates custom
functionality that you can configure. Standard tabs are provided as an included feature and
custom tabs allow you to extend or to build new application functionality. Standard and
custom tabs are described in more detail later in this chapter.

Hiding and showing tabs
To customize your personal tab settings, navigate to Setup | My Personal Settings |
Change My Display | Customize My Tabs. Now, choose the tabs that will display in each
of your apps by moving the tab name between the Available Tabs and the Selected Tabs
sections and. Click Save. The following screenshot shows the section of tabs for the Sales
app:

Profile, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Profiles. Select a profile and click on Edit. Now
click on Object Settings as shown in the following screenshot:
After accessing the Object Settings page for the profile, select the object for which tab
setting you want to configure. In this example, we choose the Account object as shown in
the following screenshot:

[ 145 ]
From within the object profile settings edit screen, set the Tab Settings style to be either
Default On, Default Off, or Tab Hidden and finally click the Save button as shown in the
following screenshot:
Standard tabs
Salesforce provides tabs for each of the standard objects that are provided in the application
when you sign up. For example, there are standard tabs for Accounts, Contacts,
Opportunities, and so on:

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 146 ]
Visibility of the tab depends on the Tab Display setting for the app.
Custom tabs
You can create three different types of custom tabs: Custom Object Tabs, Web Tabs, and
Visualforce Tabs.
Custom Object Tabs allow you to create, read, update, and delete the data records in your
custom objects. Web Tabs display any web URL in a tab within your Salesforce application.
Visualforce Tabs display custom user-interface pages created using Visualforce.
Creating custom tabs:
The text displayed on the custom tab is set using the Plural Label of the custom
object, which is entered when creating the custom object. If the tab text needs to
be changed, this can be done by changing the Plural Label stored on the custom
object.
Salesforce.com recommends selecting the Append tab to user's existing
personal customizations checkbox. This benefits your users as they will
automatically be presented with the new tab and can immediately access the
corresponding functionality without having to first customize their personal
settings themselves.
It is recommended that you do not show tabs (by setting appropriate
permissions) so that the users in your organization cannot see any of your
changes until you are ready to make them available.
You can create up to 25 custom tabs in the Enterprise Edition and as many as you
require in the Unlimited Edition at the time of writing.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 147 ]
To create custom tabs for a custom object, navigate to Setup | Create | Tabs. Now, select
the appropriate tab type and/or object from the available selections, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Renaming labels for standard tabs, standard
objects, and standard fields
Labels generally reflect the text that is displayed and presented to your users in the user
interface and in reports within the Salesforce application.
You can change the display labels of standard tabs, objects, fields, and other related user
interface labels so they reflect your company's terminology and business requirements
better. For example, the Accounts tab and object could be changed to Clients; similarly,
Opportunities to Deals, and Leads to Prospects. Once changed, the new label is
displayed on all user pages.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 148 ]
The Setup Pages and Setup Menu sections cannot be modified and do not
include any renamed labels and continue. Here, the standard tab, object,
and field reference continues to use the default, original labels. Also, the
standard report names and views continue to use the default labels and
are not renamed.
To change standard tab, objects, and field labels, navigate to Setup | Customize | Tabs
Names and Labels | Rename Tabs and Labels. Now, select a language, and then click on
Edit to modify the tab names and standard field labels:
Click on Edit to select the tab that you wish to rename.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 149 ]
Although the screen indicates that this is a change for the tab's name, this
selection will also allow you to change the labels for the object and fields
in addition to the tab name. To change field labels, go through to steps and
enter the new field labels.
Here, we are going to rename the Accounts tab to Clients. Enter the Singular and Plural
names and then click on Next:
Only the following standard tabs and objects can be renamed: Accounts,
Activities, Articles, Assets, Campaigns, Cases, Contacts, Contracts,
Documents, Events, Ideas, Leads, Libraries, Opportunities, Opportunity
Products, Partners, PriceBooks, Products, Quote Line Items, Quotes,
Solutions, and Tasks.

Salesforce looks for the Account label and displays an auto-populated screen showing
where the Account text would be replaced with Client. This auto-population of text is
carried out for the standard tab, the standard object, and the standard fields. Review the
replaced text, amend as necessary, and then click on Save:
After renaming, the new labels are automatically displayed on the tab, in reports, in
dashboards, and so on.
Some standard fields, such as Created By and Last Modified, are
prevented from being renamed because they are audit fields that are used
to track system information.
You will, however, need to carry out the following additional steps to ensure consistent
renaming throughout the system as these may need manual updates:
Check all list view names as they do not automatically update and will continue
to show the original object name until you change them manually.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 152 ]
Review standard report names and descriptions for any object that you have
renamed.
Check the titles and descriptions of any e-mail templates that contain the original
object or field name, and update them as necessary.
Review any other items that you have customized with the standard object or
field name. For example, custom fields, page layouts, and record types may
include the original tab, or field name text that is no longer relevant.
If you have renamed tabs, objects, or fields, you can also replace the Salesforce online help
with a different URL. Your users can view this replaced URL whenever they click on any
context-sensitive help link on an end-user page or from within their personal setup options.
Challenge the requirement to rename Tabs and Labels.
Consider the benefits of renaming Tabs and labels before doing so.
Renaming the labels in particular often results in added complexity and
maintenance issues because Salesforce documentation and industry
discussion will refer to the default named labels. There should be a
compelling reason and a strong business use case to rename standard
labels.
Creating custom objects
Custom objects are database tables that allow you to store data specific to your
organization, in Salesforce.com. You can use custom objects to extend Salesforce
functionality or to build new application functionality.
You can create up to 200 custom objects in the Enterprise Edition and 2000
in the Unlimited Edition at the time of writing.
Once you have created a custom object, you can create a custom tab, custom-related lists,
reports, and dashboards for users to interact with the custom object data.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 153 ]
To create a custom object, navigate to Setup | Create | Objects. Now click on New Custom
Object, or click on Edit to modify an existing custom object. The following screenshot
shows the resulting screen:

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 154 ]
On the Custom Object Information Edit page, you can enter the following:
Label: This is the visible name that is displayed for the object within the
Salesforce CRM user interface and shown on pages, views, and reports, for
example.
Plural Label: This is the plural name specified for the object, which is used within
the application in places such as reports and on tabs (if you create a tab for the
object).
Gender (language dependent): This field appears if your organization-wide
default language expects gender. This is used for organizations where the default
language settings are, for example, Spanish, French, Italian, German, among
many others. Your personal language-preference setting does not affect whether
the field appears or not. For example, if your organization's default language is
English but your personal language is French, you will not be prompted for
gender when creating a custom object.
Starts with a vowel sound: Use of this setting depends on your organization's
default language and is a linguistic check to allow you to specify whether your
label is to be preceded by an instead of a; for example, resulting in reference to
the object as an Order instead of a Order.
Object Name: A unique name used to refer to the object. Here, the Object Name
field must be unique and can only contain underscores and alphanumeric
characters. It must also begin with a letter, not contain spaces, not contain two
consecutive underscores, and not end with an underscore.
Description: An optional description of the object. A meaningful description will
help to explain the purpose of your custom objects when you are viewing them in
a list.
Context-Sensitive Help Setting: Defines what information is displayed when
your users click on the Help for this page context-sensitive help link from the
custom object record home (overview), edit, and detail pages, as well as list views
and related lists. The Help & Training link at the top of any page is not affected
by this setting; it always opens the Salesforce Help & Training window.
Record Name: This is the name that is used in areas such as page layouts, search
results, key lists, and related lists, as shown next.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 155 ]
Data Type: This sets the type of field for the record name. Here the data type can
be either text or auto-number. If the data type is set to be Text, then when a
record is created, users must enter a text value, which does not need to be unique.
If the data type is set to be Auto Number, it becomes a read-only field whereby
new records are automatically assigned a unique number:
Display Format: As in the preceding example, this option only appears when the
Data Type field is set to Auto Number. It allows you to specify the structure and
appearance of the Auto Number field. For example: {YYYY}{MM}-{000} is a
display format that produces a four-digit year, two-digit month prefix to a
number with leading zeros padded to three digits. Example data output would
include: 201203-001; 201203-066; 201203-999; 201203-1234. It is worth
noting that although you can specify the number three digits, if the number of
records created exceeds 999, the record will still be saved but the automatically
incremented number becomes 1000, 1001, and so on.
Starting Number: As described, Auto Number fields in Salesforce CRM are
automatically incremented for each new record. Here, you must enter the starting
number for the incremental count (which does not have to be set to start from
one).
Allow Reports: This setting is required if you want to include the record data
from the custom object in any report or dashboard analytics. When a custom
object has a relationship field associating it to a standard object, a new Report
Type may appear in the standard report category. The new Report Type allows
the user to create reports that relate the standard object to the custom object by
selecting the standard object for the Report Type category instead of the custom
object.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 156 ]
A new Report Type is created in the standard report category if the
custom object is either the lookup object on the standard object or the
custom object has a master-detail relationship with the standard object.
Lookup relationships and master-detail relationship fields are described in
more detail later in this section.
Allow Activities: Allows users to include tasks and events related to the custom
object records, which appear as a related list on the custom object page.
Track Field History: Enables the tracking of data-field changes on the custom
object records, such as who changed the value of a field and when it was
changed. Field history tracking also stores the value of the field before and after
the field is edited. This feature is useful for auditing and data-quality
measurement and is also available within the reporting tools. The field history
data is retained for up to 18 months and you can set field history tracking for a
maximum of 20 fields for Enterprise, Unlimited, and Performance Editions.
Allow in Chatter Groups: This setting allows your users to add records of this
custom object type to Chatter groups. When enabled, records of this object type
that are created using the group publisher are associated with the group and also
appear in the group record list. When disabled, records of this object type that are
created using the group publisher are not associated with the group.
Deployment Status: Indicates whether the custom object is now visible and
available for use by other users. This is useful as you can easily set the status to In
Development until you are happy for users to start working with the new object.
Add Notes and Attachments: This setting allows your users to record notes and
attach files to the custom object records. When this is specified, a related list with
the New Note and Attach File buttons automatically appears on the custom
object record page where your users can enter notes and attach documents.
The Add Notes & Attachments option is only available when you create a
new object.
Launch the New Custom Tab Wizard: Starts the custom tab wizard after you
save the custom object. The New Custom Tab Wizard option is only available
when you create a new object.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 157 ]
If you do not select the Launch the New Custom Tab Wizard, you will not
be able to create a tab in this step but you can create the tab later as
described in the Custom Tabs section covered earlier in this chapter. When
creating a custom object, a custom tab is not automatically created.
Object Limits
You can access the Object Limits page when planning how to customize a particular object,
or to monitor the current usage and limits, such as the number of custom fields or rules
applied.
Object Limits for standard objects
To access the standard Object Limits page, navigate to Setup | Customize. Click on the
name of the desired standard object, and then click on the limits, as shown in the following
screenshot (for the Account object):

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 158 ]
Here, you can see usage details for the following: Custom Fields, Rollup Summary Fields,
Custom Relationship Fields, Active Workflow Rules, Total Workflow Rules, Approval
Processes, Active Lookup Filters, Active Validation Rules, VLOOKUP Functions, Sharing
Rules (Both Owner-and Criteria-based), and Sharing Rules (Criteria-based Only).
Object Limits for custom objects
To view information about the usage of various fields and rules that have been created on a
custom object, you can access the Object Limits window displayed on a custom object
definitions-related list at the bottom of a custom object definition page.
When an item reaches 75 percent or more of the limit allowed for the
object, a warning message appears that identifies what can be done to
reduce the amount of usage. The object limit percentages display values
that are truncated, and not rounded up. For example, if your organization
reaches 79.55 percent of the limit for an item, the limit percentage displays
79 percent.
Creating custom object relationships
Considerations to be observed when creating object relationships are as follows:
Create the object relationships as a first step before starting to build the custom
fields, page layouts, and any related list
The Related To entry cannot be modified after you have saved the object
relationship
Each custom object can have up to two master-detail relationships and up
to 25 total relationships. Where an object has more than one master-detail
relationship, the first master-detail relationship that was created, becomes
the primary master-detail relationship. The owner of the record therefore
is derived from the first master-detail relationship that was created.
When planning to create a master-detail relationship on an object, be aware that it
can only be created before the object contains record data

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 159 ]
Master-detail relationships can be created on an object that contains record
data by first creating a lookup relationship field, populating the lookup
field, and finally converting the lookup to a master-detail relationship.
Clicking on Edit List Layout allows you to choose columns for the key views and
lookups
The Standard Name field is required on all custom object-related lists and also on
any page layouts
Creating custom fields
Before you begin to create custom fields, it is worth spending some time to first plan and
choose the most appropriate type of field to create. You can create many different custom
field types in Salesforce CRM, including text, number, currency, as well as relationship
types that enable lookup, master-detail, and hierarchical relationships.
Adding custom fields can be carried out by navigating to the field's area of the appropriate
object:
For standard objects, navigate to Setup | Customize. Now, select the appropriate
object from the Customize menu, click on Fields, and then click on New in the
Custom Fields & Relationships section of the object page.
For custom task and event fields, navigate to Setup | Customize | Activities |
Activity Custom Fields. Now, click on the New button.
For custom objects, navigate to Setup | Create | Objects. Now, select one of the
custom objects in the list. Next, click on New in the Custom field dependencies
and field history tracking
Within the field setup pages, you can set field dependencies and field history tracking for
the object. Field history tracking captures information for the date, time, nature of the
change, and who made the change. A dependent field is a picklist field for which the valid
values depend on the value of another field.
Whenever history tracking is set, a separate history data object is created for the object. This
history data comprises the record ID and the history-tracked field names whose value has
been changed. Here, both the old and the new record values are recorded. This is covered
later in this chapter in the Custom field governance section.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 160 ]
Field dependencies and field history tracking are not available for task and
event fields, and are described in more detail later in this chapter.
Choose a data type for the field to be created. The following screenshot shows the first page
(step 1) where a full list of data types (which are described in detail later) are available to
choose from:
Some data types are only available for certain configurations. For example, the Master-
Detail Relationship option is available only for custom objects when the custom object does
not already have one or more master-detail relationship fields. The Roll-Up Summary
option is only available for objects defined as Master in master-detail relation and is used to
record an aggregate of the child records, using functions such as SUM, MAX, and MIN (these
are described in detail later in this chapter).

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 161 ]
Field types not listed in custom field types may appear if your
organization installed a package from AppExchange that uses those
custom field types.
Click on Next and enter a Field Label. Field Name is a mandatory field and must be unique
within the Salesforce CRM application. There are also some restrictions on what can be
entered and what cannot. Here, you can only enter alphanumeric characters and
underscores. In addition, the text must start with a letter; it cannot include spaces, it cannot
contain two consecutive underscores, and the final character must not be an underscore.
Ensure that the custom field name and label are unique and not the same
as any existing standard or custom field for that object. Creating identical
values may result in unexpected behavior when you reference that name
in a merge field. If a standard field and custom field have matching names
or labels, the merge field displays the value of the custom field. If two
custom fields have matching names or labels, the merge field may not
display the value of the field you expect. For example, if you create a field
label called Phone, the field name automatically populates as Phone__c. If
you also have a standard field with the label Phone, the merge field may
not be able to distinguish between the standard and custom field names.
Make the custom field name and label unique by adding a suffix to each,
such as Phone_Custom and Phone_Custom__c, respectively.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 162 ]
For relationship fields, choose the object that you want to associate with it:
The number of custom fields allowed per object is 500 for both Enterprise
and Unlimited Editions of Salesforce at the time of writing. Relationship
fields count towards these custom-field limits.
Enter any field attributes. In this example, a new checkbox field is set as Checked by
default:
Object relationship fields allow you to create a lookup filter that can be used to further
control the associated returned records and lookup dialog results for the field.

Configuring Objects and Apps

These are available for Lookup, Master-detail, and Hierarchical relationship fields. Here,
you can select multiple fields and selection criteria to restrict the results. This is presented in
an additional step of the field-creation process and is available at the bottom of the Lookup
Filter section, available from step 3. Enter the label and name for the lookup field setup
page.
Click on Next to continue and specify the field's access settings for each profile as shown in
the following screenshot:
To set the field-level security, enable the following settings:

Click on Next and choose the page layouts that you would want to add the new field to as
shown in the following screenshot:
The new field is automatically positioned on the page layout as the final field in the first
two-column section. However, there is an exception for Text Area (Long) and Text Area
(Rich) fields. These fields, due to their double width, are placed as the final field on the first
one-column section on the page layout.
For user custom fields, the field is automatically added to the bottom of
the user detail page. For universally required fields, you cannot remove
the field from page layouts or make it read-only
Click on Save to finish, or on Save & New to create more custom fields.
For relationship fields, choose whether to create a related list that displays information
about the associated records. You can choose to put the related list on any page layout for
that object.
To change the label of the custom-related list as it will appear on the page layouts of the
associated object, edit the Related List Label field. This is covered later in this chapter in the
sections on Page Layouts and Related Lists.
To add the new related list to page layouts that users have already customized, check the
Append-related list to user's existing personal customizations.

Custom field data types
When creating a custom field, the first step is to select the appropriate type for the field.
There are many different field types available in Salesforce that allow the storage of records
of various data types, such as numbers, dates, and percentages. The following sections
describe the data types that are available:
Auto Number
An Auto Number field produces a unique number that is automatically incremented for
each saved record. As such, this is a read-only field where the maximum length is 30
characters, of which 20 are reserved for further prefix or suffix text that you can specify.
Checkbox
A Checkbox allows your users to set or unset a value to mark the attribute as either True or
False.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 166 ]
When using a checkbox field in a report, use True for values that are
checked values and False for unchecked values. The import wizards and
the weekly export tool use 1 for checked values and 0 for unchecked
values.
Currency
Salesforce provides a Currency field to specifically capture a monetary value. Here, the
Salesforce CRM application applies currency-related codes, which are applied when
working with that field record.
Values lose precision after 15 decimal places.
Date
A Date field provides a way for your users to either pick a date from a pop-up calendar or
to manually enter the date. Your users can also enter the current date by clicking on the date
link positioned to the right of the field.
Date/Time
A Date/Time field provides a way for your users to either pick a date from a pop-up
calendar or to manually enter the date and the time of day. Your users can also enter the
current date and time by clicking on the date and time link positioned to the right of the
field. Here, the time of day includes the A.M.-P.M. notation.
Email
An Email field provides us with the capability to store an individual's e-mail address. The
Salesforce CRM application provides a very robust method of verifying the correct format
of e-mail addresses before they are allowed to be saved. If this field is specified for contacts
or leads, users can choose the address when clicking on Send an Email.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 167 ]
You cannot use custom e-mail fields for mass e-mails. Mass e-mail can
only be sent to an e-mail address in a standard e-mail field. For e-mail
fields, users can enter a maximum length of up to 80 characters.
Formula
A Formula field enables a method to automatically calculate a value that is obtained from
other fields or values stored within Salesforce CRM. These referenced fields are known as
merge fields. Formula fields are very powerful and flexible mechanisms. However, a
formula field cannot be set to reference itself within a formula irrespective of whether the
reference is made directly or indirectly. Further information concerning formulas is covered
later in this chapter under the Building formulas section.
Salesforce uses a mechanism for decimal number place calculation in
formulas, known as a round-half up, tie-breaking rule. As an example, a
value formulated as 2.345 results in a value of 2.35 and a value formulated
as -2.345 results in a value of -2.34.
Geolocation
The geolocation custom field allows you to identify locations by their latitude and
longitude, and calculate the distance between locations.
The Geolocation field is a compound field that Salesforce stores as three
separate custom fields: one for latitude, one for longitude, and one for
internal use. Three fields are therefore added to the custom field limit
count, for the object, when creating a geolocation field.
You can then use the geolocation field with the DISTANCE and GEOLOCATION formula
functions to calculate distance between locations. For example, you can calculate the
distance between two geolocation fields (such as between the warehouse and an account-
shipping address), or between a geolocation field and any fixed latitude-longitude
coordinate.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 168 ]
The geolocation field is currently in beta release and so has the following
limitations:
History tracking is not available on geolocation fields
Geolocation fields cannot be used on custom settings
Geolocation fields cannot be included in reports, dashboards,
validation rules, Visual workflow, workflow, or approvals
Geolocation fields cannot be searched
Geolocation fields cannot be accessed within the Schema
Builder
DISTANCE and GEOLOCATION formula functions are available only when
creating formula fields or using them in Visual Workflow
Lookup relationship
The lookup relationship field is used to relate two records. Relationships can be set up
between two records of the same object type or different object types. For example,
opportunities can be related by a lookup so an opportunity hierarchy can be shown, or
cases have a lookup relationship with contacts that enable you to associate a specific contact
with a case.
A lookup relationship creates a field that allows users to click on a lookup icon which opens
up a pop-up window and allows the user to select a record to get the relationship. On the
associated record, you can display a related list to show all of the records that are linked to
it, and you can create lookup relationship fields that link to the following: users, and
custom or standard objects. See the Building relationship fields section, later in this chapter for
further options.
Master-detail relationship
This field creates a parent-child type relationship between records, where the master record
controls certain behaviors, such as security and record deletion, of the detail record.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 169 ]
Master-detail relationship fields can only be created on custom objects that relate to a
standard object and not the other way around. If the master record is deleted, then all detail
records are also deleted. You can create up to two master-detail relationship fields per
custom object. Ownership and access to the child record are determined by the parent and
the parent relationship field on the child record is not optional.
See the Building relationship fields section for further options, discussed later in this chapter.
As a best practice, Salesforce.com recommends that you do not exceed
10,000 child records for a master-detail relationship.
External lookup relationship
An external lookup field creates a relationship that links the object to an external object that
contains data that is housed outside your Salesforce CRM organization.
As this typically requires the setup of a non-Salesforce CRM external data source, detailed
discussion of this relationship is beyond the scope of this book.
Hierarchical relationship
This field type forms a hierarchical lookup relationship between relevant objects. For the
user hierarchical relationship, users can use a lookup field to associate one user with
another. For example, you can create a custom hierarchical relationship field to store each
user's direct manager. See the Building relationship fields section for further options,
discussed later in this chapter.
This type of lookup relationship is available only for the user object.
Number
The Number field can be used to enter any number, with or without a decimal place (the
number of decimal places can be specified), and saved as a real number with any leading
zeros removed.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 170 ]
Percent
A Percent field in Salesforce CRM, is similar to a number field entered as a decimal which
results in a percentage sign automatically appended to the entered value.
The value of a Percent field loses precision after 15 decimal places. A
runtime error is generated if users attempt to enter a value that contains a
decimal taken to more than 15 decimal places.
Phone
The Phone field allows the users in your organization to enter any telephone number.
While saving the record, the Salesforce CRM application will attempt to format it into a
known phone format.
When your users enter phone numbers in Phone fields, Salesforce keeps the phone number
format that has been entered. However, if the Locale field is set to English (United States)
or English (Canada), ten-digit phone numbers and 11-digit numbers that start with one are
automatically formatted as (800) 555-1234 when you save the record. If you do not want
this formatting for a 10- or 11-digit number, you can enter a + before the number, for
example, +44 117 123 4567.
For phone numbers, users can enter a maximum length of up to 40
characters.
Picklist
The Picklist field allows users to choose a value from a set of predefined text values. The
maximum length of the text values is 255 characters.
Picklist (Multi-select)
The Picklist (Multi-select) field allows users to choose more than one picklist value from a
set of predefined text values. The maximum length of the text values is 255 characters.
When saving and viewing, the data is stored as text along with semi-colons, which are used
to separate the individual picklist values.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 171 ]
Roll-up summary
A Roll-up Summary field, which is sometimes abbreviated to RUS in online forums or
discussion groups, is used to automatically display the summarized values of the related
records. This can be a record count of related records or a calculation of the sum, minimum,
or maximum value of the related records.
The records must be directly related to the selected record and on the
detail side of a custom master-detail relationship with the object that
contains the roll-up summary field. For example, a custom account field
called Total Number of Branches displays the number of branches the
custom object records in the branch-related list for Accounts.
Text
The Text field allows users to enter any combination of alphanumeric characters or
symbols. The maximum length of the text value is 255 characters.
Text (Encrypted)
The Text (Encrypted) field allows users to enter any combination of alphanumeric
characters or symbols. The text is then stored in an encrypted form. As an example, you can
create a credit card number field named Credit Card Number with a mask type of
Credit Card Number and a mask character of X. When users enter data in this field, it is
encrypted and stored in the database. When users without the View Encrypted Data
permission view the field, Salesforce displays the mask (e.g., XXXX-XXXX-XXX-1234)
instead of the value that was originally entered.
For encrypted text, you can set a maximum length of up to 175 characters.
Encrypted fields are encrypted with 128-bit master keys and use the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) algorithm.
Your master encryption key can be archived, deleted, and imported using
the Master Encryption Key Management feature, which is made available
by sending a request to Salesforce customer support.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 172 ]
Text Area
The Text Area field allows users to enter alphanumeric characters on separate lines. The
maximum length of the text value is 255 characters and a warning is displayed when the
number is about to be reached (as shown previously).
Text Area (Long)
The Text Area (Long) field provides for the storage of up to 131,072 characters that display
on separate lines, similar to a Text Area field. However, you can specify a lower maximum
length of this field type, between 256 and 131,072 characters.
Every time you press Enter within a long text area field, a line break and a
return character are added to the text. These two characters count towards
the 131,072 character limit. This data type is not available for activities or
products, on opportunities. In a report, only the first 254 characters of a
long-text area field are shown.
Text Area (Rich)
Using the Text Area (Rich) data type, your users are provided with a text field with an
embedded toolbar. This toolbar allows simple formatting of the text and provides for the
adding of images and URL web links.
The maximum size for uploaded images is 1 MB and only GIF, JPEG, and
PNG file types are currently supported.
The toolbar offers the ability to undo, redo, bolden, italicize, underline, strike-out, and
modify the alignment of text. Users can also embed a hyperlink, upload, or create a link to
an image, and add a list which can be numbered or non-numbered.
The maximum field size is 131,072 characters, which is inclusive of any
formatting or HTML tags and in reports, only the first 254 characters of a
Rich-Text area are shown.
URL
The URL field allows users to enter a web link.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 173 ]
The URL field can store up to 255 characters. However, only the first 50
characters are displayed on the record detail pages.
When the web link is clicked, the Salesforce CRM application opens a new browser window
to show the web page.
Whenever your users enter values into either a currency amount or a
number field, they can use the shortcuts k, m, or b, to indicate thousands,
millions, or billions. For example, when you enter 7k, it is displayed as
7,000.
Dependent picklists
Dependent picklists are picklists (including multi-select picklists) in which the values
available in the picklist depend on the value of another field, which is called the controlling
field.
Controlling fields can be any picklist or checkbox field within the same
record.
Controlling fields that are picklists are fields with at least one and fewer than 300 values.
These are used to help with efficient, accurate data entry and help to achieve consistent
data.
To define a dependent picklist, navigate to the field's area of the appropriate
object.
For standard objects, this is carried out by navigating to Setup | Customize |
(select the appropriate standard object) | Fields. Click on Field Dependencies.
For custom objects, navigate to Setup | Create | Objects | (select the appropriate
custom object). Click on Field Dependencies.
Now click on New, choose a controlling field and dependent field, and then click on
Continue.
Use the field-dependency matrix to specify the dependent picklist values that are available
when a user selects each controlling field value, as shown in the following screenshot:

Finally, click on Save.
Please note the following points:

Building relationship fields
When building lookup and master-detail relationship fields, there are various options and
settings that you can set, which will enforce data integrity. These options and settings are
covered in the next section.
Lookup relationship options
When you create a lookup field on an object, you can choose whether the lookup field is
required or optional. If it is set as optional, you can choose one of the following three
actions to take place if the lookup record is deleted:
Clear the value of this field:
This is a default option and is a good choice when the field does not have to
contain a value from the associated lookup record.
Don't allow deletion of the lookup record that's part of a lookup relationship
This option prevents the lookup record from being deleted and is a good choice
for restricting deletions if you have dependencies, such as workflow rules, based
on the lookup relationship.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 176 ]
Delete this record also
This option works similar to the master-detail relationship and deletes the record
whenever the lookup record is deleted. However, such a deletion on a lookup
relationship is known as a cascade-delete and bypasses security and sharing
settings. As a result, users can delete records when the lookup record is deleted
even if they do not have access to the related records.
The cascade-delete feature is disabled by default and is available only by
sending a request to Salesforce support.
This option is a good choice when the lookup field and its associated record are
highly coupled and you need to delete related data whenever the lookup data is
removed.
This option is only available within custom objects and is not available for
standard objects. However, the lookup field object can be either a standard
or custom object.
Master-detail relationship options
When you create a master-detail field on an object, you can choose the Allow reparenting
option.
Allow reparenting option
By default, records in master-detail relationships cannot be reparented. However, you can
allow child records in a master-detail relationship to be reparented to a different parent by
selecting Allow reparenting option in the master-detail relationship definition.
Lookup filters
Lookup filters are used to restrict the values and lookup dialog results for Lookup, Master-
detail, and Hierarchical relationship fields.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 177 ]
You can specify the restrictions by configuring filter criteria that compare fields and values
based on:
The current record
The related object (via the Lookup, Master-detail, or Hierarchical field)
The current user's record, permissions, and role
The records directly associated to the related object
As an example, you can:
Restrict the Contact Name field on an Account record to allow only those
contacts that have a custom status of active, filtering out inactive contacts
Restrict the Contact Name field on a case record to allow only those contacts that
are associated with the Account record specified in the Account Name field on
the Case record
Restrict the Account Name field on an Opportunity record to allow only those
users who have an International profile to create or edit Opportunity records, for
accounts outside the United States
You can optionally click on Insert Suggested Criteria to choose from a list of lookup filter
criteria that the Salesforce CRM system suggests based on the defined relationships
between the objects in your organization.
You can make lookup filters either required or optional.
For fields with required lookup filters, only values that match the lookup filter criteria
appear in the lookup dialog. For non-valid values that are manually entered into the field, 
you can set a custom error message which is presented to the user as the record is
prevented from saving.
For fields with optional lookup filters, only values that match the lookup filter criteria
appear in the lookup dialog initially. However, users can click on the Show all results link
in the lookup dialog to remove the filter and view all search result values for the lookup
field. Optional lookup filters also allow users to save values that do not match the lookup
filter criteria.
Building formulas
Custom formula fields require additional settings as specified by the Salesforce CRM
application, which are carried out using the following actions and steps:

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 178 ]
Create the Formula field.
1.
Choose the data type for the field, based on the output of the calculation.
2.
Enter the number of decimal places for currency, number, or percent data types.
3.
The setting for the number of decimal places is ignored for currency fields
in multi-currency organizations. Instead, the decimal places for your
currency setting apply. Salesforce uses the round-half up, tie-breaking rule
for numbers in formula fields. For example, 12.345 becomes 12.35 and
–12.345 becomes –12.34.
Click on Next to display the formula creation screen.
4.
Basic formula
To create a basic formula that passes specific Salesforce data, select the Simple Formula tab,
choose the field type in the Select Field Type drop-down list, and choose one of the fields
listed in the Insert Field drop-down list.
To insert an operator, choose the appropriate operator icon from the Insert Operator drop-
down list. Here, you can select from the following operators: + Add, – Subtract, * Multiply,
/ Divide, ^ Exponentiation, ( (open parenthesis character), ) (close parenthesis character),
& Concatenate, = Equal, <> Not Equal, < Less Than, > Greater Than, <= Less Than or
Equal, >= Greater Than or Equal, && And, and || Or.
Advanced formula
The basic formula feature is quite restricted and you will likely seek to create more
complicated formulas which can be performed by selecting the Advanced Formula tab.
Within this tab, click on Insert Field, choose a field, and then click on Insert.
You can now include merge fields along with advanced operators as well as functions,
which are prebuilt Salesforce CRM formulas that you can invoke and pass your input
values to by performing following steps :
Function description and example usage:
Select a function and click on Help to view a description and examples of
formulas using that function.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 179 ]
Click on Check Syntax to check your formula for errors.
1.
Enter a description of the formula in the Description box (this is optional).
2.
For formulas that result in either a number, a currency, or a percentage field, you
3.
can decide how to display blank fields. To display blank fields as a zero value,
select the option Treat blank fields as zeros. To display these fields as blank
values, select the Treat blank fields as blanks option.
Click on Next to continue.
4.
To set the field visibility for user's profiles, set the field level security and then
5.
click on Next.
Now choose which page layouts are to display the field. In this step, the field is
6.
added to the specified page layout and appears as the last field in the first two-
column section detail page.
Formula fields are automatically calculated. Therefore, they are not visible
on edit pages and are read-only on record detail pages. Formula fields do
not update last-modified date fields. Technically, formula fields are
computed at the point in time a user or system queries the record and
retrieves the field to view it. Hence the field is not altered as such and the
record is not updated due to the formula value calculation change
therefore means workflow rules, validation rules, and so on are not
triggered by a change of formula field calculation.
Click on Save to finish, or on Save & New to create more custom fields.
7.
Formula fields have character and byte size limits and cannot contain
more than 3,900 characters.
Building formulas – best practices
Some best practices and methods to improve the creation and maintenance of formula fields
are as follows:
Formatting with carriage returns and spacing
Commenting

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 180 ]
Formatting with carriage returns and spacing
Consider the following formula:
Sales Tax (Percent) =
IF(TEXT(Account.Market__c) = "US", IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) =
"California", 0.0925, IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Nevada", 0.081,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Utah", 0.0835, 0) )) , 0)
To improve the readability of formula fields, you can add spacing and carriage returns. The
preceding formula can be made far easier to understand, simply by adding spaces and
carriage returns, as in the following snippet:
Sales Tax (Percent) =
IF( TEXT(Account.Market__c) = "US",
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "California", 0.0925,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Nevada", 0.081,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Utah", 0.0835, 0) ))
, 0)
Commenting
Salesforce CRM allows you to put comments in your formulas. These are sections of text
that are not run as part of the formula and are typically used to make notes about the
formula code, especially if it is particularly complicated. Comments must start with a
forward slash followed by an asterisk (/*), and finish with an asterisk followed by a
forward slash (*/).
Comments are useful for explaining specific parts of a formula to other system
administrators viewing the formula definition. Look at the following code block as an
example:
Sales Tax (Percent) =
/* value only set for US opportunities */
IF( TEXT(Account.Market__c) = "US",
/* Check for the US State of the Account record and set accordingly */
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "California", 0.0925,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Nevada", 0.081,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Utah", 0.0835, 0) ))
)
, 0)

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 181 ]
Carefully using comments to prevent parts of the formula from being activated allows you
to test and verify the syntax as you construct and iron out bugs in the formula. However, if
you try to comment out the entire formula as syntax, an error is shown. Also, you will
experience a syntax error if you try to place comments within other comments because this
is not supported in the Salesforce CRM application:
/* /* comment */ */
Including comments and formatting with carriage returns and spacing
adds to the number of characters used and therefore counts against the
character and byte size limits.
Building formula text and compiled
character size limits
There is a text character and byte size limit of 3,900 characters, and a limit of 5,000
characters for the compiled characters for formulas.
When this limit is reached, you will be unable to save the formula field and will be
presented with the following error:
Compiled formula is too big to execute (7,085 characters). Maximum size is
5,000 characters.
It is common to encounter these limits when building complicated formula field
calculations and particularly so when building formulas that reference other formula fields.
While there is no way to increase this limit, there are some methods to help avoid and
workaround these limitations, listed as follows:
Use the CASE function for branch conditions
Use algebra
For formulas that use multiple branch conditions to derive the values, as in the preceding
example formula, check if the market is US and the state is California, Nevada, or Utah.
You can replace the nested IF statements and instead use the CASE statement.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 182 ]
Nested IF statements often result in larger compiled sizes where the IF function is used
multiple times, as in our example:
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "California", 0.0925,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Nevada", 0.081,
IF(TEXT(Account.State__c) = "Utah", 0.0835, 0) ))
Using the CASE statement can provide better logic and often results in a smaller compiled
size for the formula:
IF( TEXT(Account.Market__c) = "US",
CASE(Account.State__c,
"California", 0.0925,
""Nevada", 0.0685,
"Utah", 0.0475, 0) ,
0)
Using algebra
The compiled size of formula fields increases as you increase the number of fields that are
referenced. This is compounded when you are referencing fields that are themselves
formula fields. A way to reduce the overall size is to use algebra to avoid the need to
reference fields, wherever possible. The following example shows how the Item_Price__c
and Support_Price__c fields are used multiple times:
Total Price =
(Item_Price__c + (Item_Price__c * Sales_Tax__c)) +
(Support_Price__c + (Support_Price__c * Sales_Tax__c))
To reduce the compiled size, use simple algebra to avoid multiple uses of the
Item_Price__c and Support_Price__c fields, as in the following example:
Total Price =
(Item_Price__c * (1 + Sales_Tax__c)) +
(Support_Price__c * (1 + Sales_Tax__c))

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 183 ]
Formula field size limit workarounds
There may be situations where the logic that is required for a formula is simply too complex
for the current size limitations in formula fields. The proven methods to overcome this are
to implement a solution using either of the following:
Workflow field updates
Apex trigger updates
Process Builder field updates
There are two ways in which workflow field updates can help to provide the formula logic
workaround. Firstly, larger and more complex formulas can be saved using the formula-
building function within the workflow mechanism. Secondly, large formula logic can be
decomposed into smaller functions of resulting data. For example, you could create simple
formulas that get the data fed from fields that have been updated by multiple workflow
field updates.
Workflows are covered in detail later in this book. However, the general approach for
implementing a workflow field update to provide a solution to the formula field limit is to:
Create a non-formula field on the object, such as a currency or number field, in
place of the desired formula field. Administrators often identify this field with a
suffix to indicate it is a workflow field-for example, Total Price (workflow). This
field is then set as read-only on page layouts as the field can be considered a
system field (as it should not be available for manual updating).
Create a workflow rule that will always fire.
Create a field update with an appropriate formula to update the workflow field-
Total Price (workflow) in our preceding example.
Any subsequent formulas can reference the populated field. The disadvantages to this
workaround are that creating many workflows can add to the complexity of the application
and may eventually introduce performance issues. Also, whenever an object has multiple
complex workflows assigned, the order in which the workflows are evaluated cannot
always be guaranteed, which if not properly maintained can lead to subtle data
discrepancies.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 184 ]
Custom field governance
Controlling the creation of fields is necessary to avoid adding unnecessary new fields in
Salesforce. Without appropriate field creation governance, there is a risk of producing an
application with a complex data structure that provides a poor user experience.
This issue can often be observed due to the ease of creating new custom fields. However,
there are other causes such as:
Configuring spontaneous responses to end-user field creation requests without
gathering full requirements
Lack of specification or understanding of reporting requirements for field usage
Creation of fields that are too specific for common uses, thus driving the need to
create ever more fields
Lack of knowledge or awareness of existing fields that could be used rather than
creating new ones
As the number of unnecessary fields increases, users will find it ever more difficult to enter
the correct data into the correct fields. Therefore, the amount of entered data is reduced
along with user's satisfaction because the application requires less effort to work with. It is
all too easy for your users to become dissatisfied and this can lead to less overall usage and
hence poor data quality due to lack of user participation.
Addressing the issue
Create new fields with care because as each new custom field is added, your application
structure increases in complexity. As a system administrator, you are responsible for
knowing which fields are used, where they appear on Page Layouts, and which fields are
required for reporting.
If the benefits and long-term use for a new field cannot be easily understood, it is unlikely
to be of much use. One method to help determine its use is to consider where and how the
proposed new field would be used. If it is never going to be reported, it may be worth
querying its purpose and value. The following considerations can be made when creating
new fields.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 185 ]
More generic field names
Try to make your field names more generic so that they can serve multiple purposes. In
some situations, different business units share objects but track different information.
Although they may have different requirements, they can often share fields. Here you need
to be proactive, forward-thinking, and reach out to the business and propose fields that can
be used across multiple business units.
Field history tracking
Often there are unnecessary date fields that are used to track milestones or data-processing
dates. With native field history tracking, these milestones can be tracked and reported
without the need to always create new fields.
Field history tracking can be applied on certain custom and standard fields for custom
objects and the following core standard objects: Accounts, Cases, Contacts, Contracts,
Leads, and Opportunities using the Set History Tracking button, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Upon clicking on the Set History Tracking button, a page appears, displaying the activation
of field history tracking and selection of the fields to be tracked, as shown in the following
screenshot:

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 186 ]
Changes to fields that have been set up for field history tracking will see a new entry to the
object's history-related list whenever changes are made to records (where that field is
modified). All entries include the date, time, details of the change, and the name of the user
that made the change as shown here.
Not all field types can have their history tracked. Changes to field types
greater than 255 characters are tracked as edited; their old and new values
are not recorded.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 187 ]
There is a maximum of 20 fields per object that can be set to be tracked.
Field history data does not count against your organization's storage limit,
however, at the time of publication, Salesforce.com are planning to move
toward a policy of deleting field history data that is older than 18 months.
Here, they recommend establishing your own field history retention
policy such as extracting the data from the system.
Custom objects to store dated information
You can create custom objects to store dated information and related lists to avoid hard-
coding date fields on a record. For example, avoid creating fields to track dated historical
financial information within an object. Here, you may have to create redundant fields for
each year. For example, 2011 Budgets, 2012 Budgets, and so on. Instead, create a
Financials object with one set of fields and a corresponding date field where you can
create a new record each year. This can result in fewer fields and far better display and
reporting.
Chatter
Consider the use of Chatter to eliminate unnecessary fields. Often, text-area boxes are used
to track conversation flows such as support comments and internal review. These text
messages can often be better facilitated with the use of Chatter posts. Chatter is covered
later in Chapter 8, Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of
Salesforce CRM.
Page layouts
Page layouts are used to organize the display of fields, buttons, custom links, inline
Visualforce pages, Report charts, and related lists on an object detail or edit page. They are
used to establish unique layouts for different business scenarios.
The displayed fields within a related list are controlled by the page layout; the name of the
related list is determined by the lookup/master-detail relationship on the related object.
Page layouts are comprised of sections containing the buttons, fields, related lists, and
customer links which can be edited using the enhanced page layout editor as shown in the
following screenshot. Here, we are showing how we can edit the properties of the Account
Site field.

You can combine page layouts and field-level security to make the lowest possible
permission setting. For example, a hidden field (field-level permission) will never be
displayed regardless of page layout. Likewise, a field marked as Always requires a value in
this field to save a record will always be required on the page layout.
Page layouts allow you to create and organize sections on a page and to show or hide fields
within sections.
Hidden fields may still be accessible elsewhere in the application. Use
field-level security to restrict all possible means of accessing a field.

Feed-based page layouts
Feed-based page layouts offer a two tabbed page that allows users to switch between a
Chatter feed and a detail page for the record. The tabs are marked Feed and Details as
shown in the following screenshot:
A prerequisite for feed-based layouts, is the enabling of feed tracking for the object that you

To use this option, Actions in the Publisher must have been enabled.
Enable Compact Feed View in the Console
Selecting this option shows a compact view of actions and feed items to give users a more
streamlined view of the feed in console tabs or subtabs.
To use this option, Actions in the Publisher must have been enabled.
Highlight Externally Visible Feed Items
Selecting this option uses a gray user icon along with orange shading to mark the feed items
that are visible to external users.
To use this option, the Compact Feed View must have been enabled.

Other Tools and Components
In this section you can configure the page to carry out the following:
Custom Components
Adding custom components using the Custom Components option. Here you select up to
10 Visualforce pages to use as custom components. These Visualforce pages must use a
standard controller for the object.
Choose Placement
This option allows you to choose where the items set in the Other Tools and Components
appear on the page.
Hide Sidebar
This option allows you to choose if the page is displayed with the sidebar removed from the
page.
Feed Filter Options
This set of options allow you to choose which feed filters are available, and where they
appear. Here you can set the filters to appear as a fixed list in the left column, as a floating
list in the left column, or as a drop-down list in the center column.
You can also set the feed filter to appear as in-line links in Compact Feed View in the
console. When Compact Feed is enabled, this option overrides the list selection used for
standard feed layouts.
To configure feed-based layouts you need to use the enhanced page layout
editor; you cannot configure feed-based layouts with the original page
layout editor.
One you have selected the option for the feed-based page layout, you can then assign the
page layout to appropriate user profiles as required.

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 199 ]
You cannot change existing standard page layouts to feed-based. Only
newly created page layouts can be set to be feed-based. Currently, feed-
based page layouts can only created for Account, Contact, Leads,
Opportunity, Case, Asset, and Custom Objects.
Record types
Record types are a feature of Salesforce CRM that allow you to provide different sets of
object picklists, different page layouts, and custom business processes to specific users,
based on their profile or assigned permission set. Record types can be used in various ways,
for example:
Create record types for opportunities to differentiate your internal sales deals
from your field sales deals and show different fields and picklist values
Create record types for leads to display different page layouts for your tele-sales
leads versus your internal sales prospecting functions
Creating a record type
The record type,  Master , is always set for every object and contains all the picklist and
process options. It is not, however, listed under the record types list and it can be assigned
as a record type for a profile, provided it is the only assigned as a record type for that
profile.
Since each record type is assigned to one page-layout type per profile, the numbers of page
assignments can easily increase. This means that if you have two custom record types for an
account and five profiles, you will have 15 page assignments (5*2 for each custom record
type, and five for the Master record type).
Selectable record types are assigned per profile and field-level security is configured
separately for each record type. Consider the following when creating a record type:
Which record types are associated with the current profile?
If more than one record type is associated with the current profile, prompt the
user for record-type selection
If only one, select that record type without prompting (this would be set as
default)
Based upon record type and profile, assign the appropriate page layout

Configuring Objects and Apps
[ 200 ]
Based upon record type, assign the appropriate process and picklist values
By associating different record types to different page layouts, fields, and picklist
values, you can formulate a set of object-specific processes. In Salesforce CRM,
the following are available:
The Lead process using the Lead object, which is governed by the
Status field (which is configured to be Open, Closed, and so on)
The Sales process, which uses the Opportunity object and the
Stage field (set to be WON, LOST, and so on), plus the Amount
and Probability fields
The Support process, which uses the Case object and is controlled
by the CaseStatus field (which may be set to Open, Closed, and
so on)
The Solutions process, which uses the Solution object and the
fields Status (which are set to be Draft, Deployed, and so on)
For example, your sales team creates an opportunity that represents a sales deal. Your sales
support team then upsells on this deal. You can then create two sales processes with two
different record types and two different page layouts: Sales and Support.
You would want to create a lookup relationship from opportunity to opportunity, and only
require or display this relationship for the support team profile.
You would also be able to configure the sharing rules so that they could not modify each
other's opportunities. This is covered in detail in Chapter 4, Securing Access to Data and Data
Validation.
You can assign custom Record Types in Permission Sets as well as in
Profiles.
Related lists
Related lists display on the lower portion of the object detail page to display the related
record details. Related lists show the object records that are associated with that record.

Summary
In this chapter, we described the ways in which the data structure and user-interface
features can be configured within Salesforce CRM.
We looked at how object and records information can be accessed. We also looked at the
mechanisms for managing the methods that users use to view this information using views
and page layouts.
We were shown how these record structures and user interfaces are controlled by the
profile and the wider picture for the way configuration of these concepts are applied for
users.
We discussed some techniques to help govern the way the configuration and creation of
fields can be carried out and some common pitfalls to avoid.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the areas of Standard and Custom Objects.
In the next chapter, we will look in detail at the mechanisms for controlling access to data
records and the features that provide data management and record sharing.

Securing Access to Data and
Data Validation
In the previous chapters, we have looked at how Salesforce controls access to information
using the user profile mechanism. We have seen how the appropriate object level
permissions, such as create, read, update, and delete have to be set on the user's profile to
allow the user corresponding permissions to the records of that object type.
In this chapter, we will look at organization-wide sharing defaults, roles, and other sharing
settings which compliment and extend the assigning of access permissions to users within
the Salesforce CRM application.
This chapter also looks in detail at some of the mechanisms for controlling record updates
and features that allow you to govern and control the quality of data entered into Salesforce
CRM.
Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of
Salesforce CRM administration in the area of security and access which are covered in this
chapter.
The following topics are being covered in this chapter:
Levels of data access and security
Data access security model
Organization-Wide Defaults
Granting access using hierarchies
Granting users additional access

Levels of data access and security
There are various features within Salesforce CRM that provide data access and security that
can be configured by system administrators and these can be applied at different levels in
the platform. We will now look at the multiple levels that allow you to apply data access
and security control to the information in your Salesforce org.
Organization
The first and highest level of data access and security is at the organization level. This
allows for controlled access to Salesforce by authorized users where you can configure rules
such as password policies and login access rules. These settings are covered in Chapter 2,
Managing Users and Controlling System Access.
Objects and fields
The second and third level of data access and security is at object and field level
respectively. Data access and security at object level provides the most basic category of
controlling which data users have access to. Objects can have permissions applied to allow
or prevent users from creating, reading, updating, or deleting data records for that
particular object. The third level is at field level. Here, you can use field-level security to
control access to specific fields. You can restrict access to a particular field and prevent a
user from accessing it even if they have full access to the associated object. These features
are covered in Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 215 ]
Records
The lowest level of data access and security enables you to control access at record level.
The mechanisms for record level access allow for control at the most precise level where
you can allow particular users to view object and fields, but then restrict the actual records
associated with that object. For example, record-level access can be set to allow a user to
view and edit their own records, without exposing these records to other users in the
system. This level of access is made possible in Salesforce CRM with the in-built data access
security model.
The data access security model
There are several flexible options for you to control how records are accessed within your
organization.
In the previous chapter, we looked at the broadest way that you can control data by setting
properties for the objects that a user can view, edit, and create through the configuration
and assignment of profiles.
We also looked at the creation of fields and field-level security which is set at profile level
and is applied to records at the database level. Returning to the diagram, we will now look
at the security model shown at the top-right corner of the following diagram:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 216 ]
The data access security model is the lowest level of data access and security, and enables
you to control access at record level using the following four features:
Organization-Wide Defaults (OWDs)
Role hierarchy
Sharing rules
Manual sharing
The following diagram shows how, with the addition of each extra feature shown, the scope
of provided access to records widens:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 217 ]
We will now look at mechanisms to control access at record level using the following
features: Organization-Wide Defaults (OWDs); Role hierarchy; Sharing rules; and Manual
sharing. We will begin by describing the OWDs.
Organization-Wide Defaults
OWDs sharing settings are used to define the default sharing settings for an organization.
For most objects, sharing settings can be set to Private, Public Read Only, or Public
Read/Write.
OWDs sharing settings, specify the default level of access to records and can be set
separately for most of the objects in Salesforce such as accounts, contacts, and activities.
When setting up the OWDs, you can set the access level for internal users
using the Default Internal Access settings and set a different default
access level for external users using the Default External Access settings.
Here, external users are part of the Community Management feature
which is provided by Salesforce at additional cost and is used to
collaborate with individuals associated with your company's ecosystem
such as suppliers, vendors or any other third-party venture.
As shown in the preceding diagram, along with the user's profile, the OWD defines the
baseline level of access to data records that users do not own. The diagram represents the
visibility or data access which is increasing as the other features are incorporated to provide
wider sharing settings.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 218 ]
To customize your OWD settings, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Sharing
Settings. Now click on Edit in the Organization-Wide Defaults area and then for each
object, select the Default Internal Access you want as shown in the following screenshot:
OWDs access level actions
The OWDs access levels allow the following actions to be applied to object records:
Access Level
Action
Public Full Access (Option for setting the Campaign object
only)
Change ownership of record
Search records
Report on records
Add related records
Edit details of record
Delete record
Public Read/Write/Transfer (Option for setting the Lead and
Case objects only)
Change ownership of record
Search records

Public Read/Write
Search records
Report on records
Add related records
Edit details of record
Public Read Only
Search records
Report on records

Private
No searching
No reporting
Public Full Access (Campaigns only)
Access levels for the Campaign OWDs can be set to Private, Public Read Only, Public
Read/Write, or Public Full Access. When Campaign is set to Public Full Access, all users
can view, edit, transfer, delete, and report on all Campaign records.
For example, in the scenario where John is the owner of a Campaign, all other users in the
application can view, edit, transfer, or delete that Campaign.
The Public Full Access option is available only for the Campaign object.
Public Read/Write/Transfer (Cases Or Leads
Only)
Access levels for Case or Lead OWDs can be set to Private, Public Read Only, Public
Read/Write, or Public Read/Write/Transfer. When Case or Lead are set to
PublicRead/Write/Transfer, all users can view, edit, transfer, and report on all Case or Lead
records.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 220 ]
For example, if Lucy is the owner of WidgetX case number 101, all other users can view,
edit, transfer ownership, and report on that case. But only Lucy can delete or change the
sharing on case number 101 (see Manual sharing rules later in this chapter).
The Public Read/Write/Transfer option is available only for Case or Lead.
Public Read/Write
All users can view, edit, and report on all records.
For example, if Mike is the owner of the Emerald Inc. Account record, all other users can
view, edit, and report on the Emerald Inc. account. However, only Mike has the ability to
delete the Emerald Inc. account record or alter the sharing settings.
Public Read Only
All users can view and report on records but they cannot edit them. Here, only the record
owner and if the Grant Access Using Hierarchies checkbox is enabled (see earlier
Organization-Wide Sharing Defaults Edit screen screenshot) users above that user's role in
the role hierarchy can edit the records.
The Grant Access Using Hierarchies checkbox is enabled by default for
standard objects and cannot be disabled. The Grant Access Using
Hierarchies checkbox can be enabled or disabled for custom objects.
For example, Nicole is the owner of the EuroCorp Inc. Account record and Nicole works in
the International Sales department, reporting to Julia, who is the VP of International Sales.
In this scenario, both Nicole and Julia have full read/write access to EuroCorp Inc.
Now, say Mike also works in International Sales; however, with the Public Read Only
setting he can view and report on the EuroCorp Inc. account record, but cannot edit or
delete it.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 221 ]
Private
Only the record owner and if the Grant Access Using Hierarchies checkbox is enabled (see
earlier Organization-Wide Sharing Defaults Edit screen screenshot) users above that role in
the hierarchy can view, edit, and report on those records. For example, if Mike is the owner
of an Account record, and he is assigned to the role of International Sales, reporting to Julia,
who is the VP of International Sales, then Julia can also view, edit, and report on Mike's
accounts.
No Access, View Only, or Use (Price Book only)
Access levels for the Price Book OWDs can be set to either, No Access, View Only, or Use.
Use is the default access level and allows all users to access the Price Book information as
well as using the Price Book configuration for opportunities with products. View Only 
allows users to access Price Book information but not to use that Price Book detail in
opportunities with products. No Access restricts users from accessing information for Price
Books and Prices.
The No Access, View Only, or Use choice of options is available only for
Price Books which is covered in Chapter 8, Introducing Sales Cloud, Service
Cloud, and Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM.
Granting Access using Hierarchies
By default, Salesforce uses hierarchies, such as the role or territory hierarchy, to
automatically grant record access to users above the record owner in the hierarchy.
This automatic granting of access to user's data to other users higher up in the Salesforce
CRM hierarchy can be disabled for custom objects using the Grant Access Using
Hierarchies checkbox. When this checkbox is not selected, only the record owner and users
granted access by the Organization-Wide Defaults gain access to the records. For standard
objects the Grant Access Using Hierarchies checkbox is set by default and cannot be
unchecked.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 222 ]
Here we see the options available for an example custom object where, for the custom object
Country, we have set the default access to Public Read/Write and the Grant Access Using 
Hierarchies setting is checked as shown in the following screenshot:
Controlled by Parent
When Controlled by Parent is set on an object, as a result of the object being the detail side
of a master-detail relationship, a user can perform an action (such as view, edit, or delete)
on the record based on whether they can perform that same action on the parent record
associated with it. For example, if a Contact record is associated with the WidgetX account
using Controlled by Parent, then a user can only edit that contact if they can also only edit
the WidgetX account record.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 223 ]
Allow users to update each other's activities:
Tasks and Events are by default set to Private (via the Activity setting as
shown in the preceding screenshot). To allow users to update each other's
activities (for example, to permit a user to set a task that they do not own
to complete), you will need to set the Activity setting to be Controlled by
Parent and ensure that the object that is related to the activity is also
accessible to that user.
When a custom object is on the detail side of a master-detail relationship with a standard
object, its OWDs is automatically set to Controlled by Parent and it is not editable, as
shown in the following screenshot for the custom object Book:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 224 ]
Although Grant Access Using Hierarchies can be deselected to prevent
users that are higher in the role or territory hierarchy having automatic
access, users with the View All and Modify All object permissions and
the View All Data and Modify All Data profile permissions can still
access records they do not own.
OWDs need to be defined separately for any custom objects that are created in the
Salesforce CRM application.
For some standard objects, you cannot actually change the Organization-Wide Sharing
Default setting.
For example, the OWDs for the Solution object in Salesforce is preset to Public Read/Write
which cannot be changed.
You can use OWDs to set the default level of record access for the following standard
objects where the default organization-wide sharing settings are:
Object
Default Access
Accounts
Public Read/Write
Activities
Private
Assets
Public Read/Write
Calendar
Hide Details and Add Events
Campaigns
Public Full Access
Cases
Public Read/Write/Transfer
Contacts
Controlled by Parent
Contracts
Public Read/Write
Custom Objects
Public Read/Write
Leads
Public Read/Write/Transfer
Opportunities
Public Read Only
Price Books
Use
Service Contracts Contracts Private
Users
Public Read Only
Private for external users

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 225 ]
Activities behave differently to other objects and in spite of the Private
setting for the Organization-Wide Sharing Default, users with read
access to the parent record to which the activity is associated can view all
the activities regardless of who owns the activity. Therefore if you share
an account record to a user or set of users all the activities on that record
become visible to the user or set of users.
External OWDs for sharing
Organization-Wide Defaults often referred to in Salesforce CRM as OWDs, specify the
default level of access to records and can be set separately for most of the objects in
Salesforce such as accounts, contacts, and activities.
External OWDs allow you to apply a different default access level for external users such as
Chatter external users, Community users, Customer Portal users, and so on.
Using External OWDs allows you to simplify the sharing model for your organization. For
example, without External OWDs, if you want Public Read Only or Public Read/Write
access for internal users but Private for external users, you would have to set the default
access to Private and create a sharing rule to share records with all internal users. With
separate OWDs, one for internal and one for external users, you can achieve similar
behavior by setting the default internal access to Public Read Only or Public Read/Write
and the default external access to Private.
External organization-wide defaults can be used to set sharing for
Accounts (and their associated contracts and assets), Cases, Contacts,
Opportunities, Users, and Custom Objects.
Having separate OWDs, one for internal and one for external users also speeds up
performance for reports, list views, and searches.
External users include: Authenticated website users, Chatter external
users, Community users, Customer Portal users, Guest users, High-
volume portal users, Partner Portal users, and Service Cloud Portal users.

To activate External OWD settings, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Sharing
Settings. Now click on the Enable External Sharing Model button as shown in the
following screenshot:
Effects of Modifying Default Access Type
When you change the default access type, say from Private to Public Read/Write, the
organization record sharing for that object is re-calculated and you may be presented with a
warning confirmation dialog message, as shown in the following screenshot, notifying that
an e-mail will be received when the OWDs update finishes:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 227 ]
Granting users additional access
Where the OWDs setting for an object is Private or Public Read Only, you can grant users
additional access to records with the use of permission sets, role hierarchies, and sharing
rules.
Sharing rules and permission sets can only be used to grant additional
access and cannot be used to restrict access to records from what was
originally specified with the OWDs

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 228 ]
Permission sets
Permission sets allow you to further control access to the system for the users in your
organization. They can be considered as a method to fine-tune the permissions for selected
individuals and enable access in a similar way to the setting up of profiles.
While an individual user can have only one profile, you can assign multiple permissions
and permission sets to users. For example, you can create a permission set called Convert
Leads, say, that provides the facility for converting and transfer of Leads, using the App
Permissions and assign it to a user who has a profile that does not provide Lead
Conversion. You can create a permission set called Export Reports, say, that uses the System
Permissions Export Reports to allow specific users to export data from reports. You can also
create a permission set called Access Widget, using an Object Settings permission, which is
associated to a custom object called Widget that is set in the OWDs as Private. Here, you
can assign it to a user who has a profile that does not include the ability to access Widgets
through their profile settings.
It is a two-step process to set up permission sets for users which includes:
Creating the permission set from the Permission Set edit page.
1.
Assigning the user to the permission set from the User edit page.
2.
Creating the permission set from the Permission Set
edit page
To view and manage your organization's permission set, navigate to Setup | Manage Users
| Permission Sets. For a new permission set, click on the New button, and complete the
sections permission set information and Select the type of users who will use this
permission set. Now edit the Object Permissions and Field Permissions and choose the
required object.

The following screenshot shows the creation of a permission set that allows users to access
the widgets object (which is set to Private in the Organization-Wide Default access model):

Click on Permission Set Assignments and then Edit Assignment to view and select from
the list of available permissions. The following screenshot shows the resulting section:
You can create up to 1,000 permission sets for your organization.
You can group multiple permissions into a permission set to create specific profile-like
permissions without actually having to create or clone complete profiles which are often
unnecessary and time-consuming.
Role hierarchy
Once the Organization-Wide Defaults have been established, you can use a role hierarchy to
ensure that managers can view and edit the same records as their line reports (or
subordinates). Users at any given role level are always able to view, edit, and report on all
data owned by or shared with users below them in the hierarchy, unless the OWD settings
specify to ignore the hierarchies.
To view and manage your organization's role hierarchy, navigate to Setup | Manage Users
| Roles as shown in the following screenshot:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 231 ]
Here you can choose to view the hierarchy in one of the following options:
Show in tree view
This view displays a visual representation of the parent-child relationships between your
roles. Click on Expand All to see all roles or Collapse All to see only top-level roles. To
expand or collapse an individual role node, you may click on the plus [+] or minus [–] icon
as shown in the preceding screenshot.

[ 232 ]
Show in sorted list view
This view displays the roles as a list that you can sort alphabetically by role name, parent
role (Reports to), or report display name. If your organization has a large number of roles,
this view provides a far easier way to navigate the hierarchy as shown in the following
screenshot:
To show a filtered list of roles, select a predefined list from the View drop-down list, or
click on Create New View to define your own custom view of roles. To edit or delete any
view you have created, select it from the View drop-down list and click on the Edit link.
Once in the Edit View page you can click on the Delete button to delete the list view.
The columns that are shown in Show in sorted list view screen are
Action, Role, Reports to, and Report Display Name and the columns can
be sorted

This view displays the roles as an indented list of roles and their child nodes, grouped
alphabetically by the name of the top-level role as follows:
The columns that are shown in Show in list view screen are role, reports
to, and report display name and the columns cannot be sorted.
To create a role, click on New Role or Add Role, depending on whether your view of roles
is using the list view or tree view, and enter the role fields as needed.
You can create up to 500 roles for your organization at the time of writing.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 234 ]
To edit a role, click on Edit next to a role name, then update the role fields as needed. You
can delete a role, by clicking on Del next to the role name.
To assign other users to a role, click on Assign next to the role name and to view detailed
information about a role, click on the role name.
If your organization uses territory management, forecasts are based on the
territory hierarchy instead of the role hierarchy.
Role hierarchies do not need to represent your company's organization chart and instead,
each role in the hierarchy should be considered as a level of data access that your users or
groups in Salesforce require.
Depending on your sharing settings, roles can control the level of visibility that users have
into your organizations data. Users at a particular role level can view, edit, and report on all
data that is owned by, or has been shared with, users below them in the hierarchy. This is
assuming your organization's sharing mechanism for that object type does not specify
otherwise.
Specifically, in the Organization-wide defaults related list, if the Grant Access Using
Hierarchies option is disabled for a custom object, say, then only the record owner and 
users granted access by the organization-wide defaults can access that custom object's
records.
Although, it is possible to create a user record without a role, users would need to be
assigned to a role, so that their records will appear in opportunity reports, forecast roll-ups,
and any other display based on roles.
When an account owner is not assigned a role, the sharing access for
related contacts is Read/Write, provided the Organization-wide default
for contacts is not Controlled by Parent. Sharing access on related
opportunities and cases is No Access.
Users that are to have access to all records in Salesforce CRM should be set at the top-most
position of the role hierarchy.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 235 ]
When you change a user's role, any relevant sharing rules are re-evaluated to add or
remove access to records as necessary.
It is not necessary to create individual roles for each and every job title
within your company. Instead, aim to define a hierarchy of roles that will
help to control the access of information entered by users in lower level
roles.
To view detailed information about a role, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Roles.
Clicking on the role name will present the role details page as shown in the following
screenshot:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 236 ]
To view the Role Detail page for a parent or sibling role, click the Role Name in the
hierarchy or siblings list.
To edit the role details, click on Edit.
To remove the role from the hierarchy, click on Delete.
Within the Users in Role related list you have the following options:
Assign a user to the role by clicking on Assign Users to Role
Add a user to your organization by clicking on New User
Modify user information by clicking on Edit next to a user's name
View a user's details by clicking on the user's Full Name, Alias, or Username
When you edit roles, sharing rules are usually automatically re-evaluated
to add or remove access to records as required. If these changes result in
too many records changing at once, a message appears warning that the
sharing rules will not be automatically re-evaluated, and that you have to
manually recalculate them (as shown further). Sharing rules should be
used when a user or group of users need access to records not already
granted to them with either the role hierarchy setup or the organization-
wide default settings. When you modify users in a role, any sharing rules
are also re-evaluated to add or remove access as necessary.
Organization-wide defaults and sharing rules
A user's level of access to records will never be more restrictive with the use of sharing rules
than the options chosen in the OWDs. The OWDs are a minimum level of access for all
users.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 237 ]
Sharing rules
With sharing rules, you are in effect setting automatic extensions to your Organization-
Wide Sharing Defaults settings for particular sets of users. As shown in the following
screenshot, this can be considered as opening up visibility and access to records for those
users.
Sharing rules apply to:
All new and existing records owned by the specified role or group members
Both active and inactive users
Sharing rules extend the access specified by OWDs and the role hierarchy.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 238 ]
Sharing rules can never be stricter than your OWDs settings and allow
wider data access for the included users or groups of users. To define
sharing rules, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Sharing Settings.
Now scroll down to the lower part of the page to reveal the Sharing Rules
sections.
The following screenshot shows the Sharing Rules page where there are sections to set the 
sharing rules for the various standard objects within the application, such as Lead, Account,
and Contact, as well as any custom objects in your organization:
Within the Sharing Rules setup section, the following object sharing rules can be applied:

Account sharing rules
These rules are based on the account owner or other criteria, including account record types
or field values, and set the default sharing access for accounts and their associated Contract,
Asset, Opportunity, Case, and (optionally) Contact records.
Account territory sharing rules
These rules are based on territory assignment and set the default sharing access for Account
and their associated Case, Contact, Contract, and Opportunity records.
Campaign sharing rules
These rules are based on Campaign owner and set the default sharing access for the
individual Campaign records.
Case sharing rules
These rules are based on the Case owner or other criteria, including case record types or
field values and set the default sharing access for the individual case and associated account
records.
Contact sharing rules
These rules are based on the Contact owner or other criteria, including contact record types
or field values and set the default sharing access for the individual contact and associated
account records.
Lead sharing rules
These rules are based on the Lead owner and set the default sharing access for the
individual lead records.

[ 240 ]
Opportunity sharing rules
These rules are based on the Opportunity owner or other criteria, including opportunity
record types or field values and set the default sharing access for the individual opportunity
and their associated account records.
User sharing rules
These rules are based on Group membership (described later in this chapter) or other
criteria and set the default sharing access for the individual user records.
Custom object sharing rules
These rules are based on the custom object record owner or other criteria, including custom
object record types or field values and set default sharing access for individual custom
object records.
Groups
Groups allow you to simplify the setting up of OWD sharing access via a sharing rule for
sets of users or for individual users to selectively share their records with other users.
Public groups
Public groups are sets of users that only administrators are permitted to create and edit.
However, when created, public groups can be used by everyone in the organization.
Public groups may contain individual users, users in a particular role or territory, users in a
specified role along with all the users below that role in the role hierarchy, or other public
groups.
Personal groups
Personal groups are sets of users that everyone can create and edit for their personal use.
Personal groups may contain individual users, public groups, the users in a particular role
or territory, or the users in a particular role along with all the users below that role or in the
hierarchy.

When you add a new sharing rule, the access levels for the sharing rule are calculated and
you are provided with a warning confirmation dialog message, as shown in the following
screenshot, indicating that this operation could take a significant time:
The effects of changing or deleting sharing rules, as well as the transferring of records
between users, cause re-evaluation of appropriate record access for the impacted users.
If these changes affect too many records at once, a message appears
warning that the sharing rules will not be automatically re-evaluated, and
you must manually recalculate them.
The following list outlines what changes can be done to Sharing Rules and the consequence
of applying these changes:
When you change the access levels for a sharing rule, all existing records are
automatically updated to reflect the new access levels
When you delete a sharing rule, the sharing access created by that rule is
automatically removed
When you transfer records from one user to another, the sharing rules are re-
evaluated to add or remove access to the transferred records as necessary
When you modify which users are in a group or role, any sharing rules are re-
evaluated to add or remove access to these users as necessary
Users higher in the role hierarchy are automatically granted the same access that
users below them in the hierarchy have from a sharing rule

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 242 ]
When you edit groups, roles, and territories, sharing rules are usually
automatically re-evaluated to add or remove access as needed. Manually
recalculating sharing rules can be performed at any time.
To manually recalculate sharing rules, navigate to Setup | Security Controls | Sharing
Settings. Now scroll down to the lower part of the page to reveal the Sharing Rules
sections and in the Sharing Rules related list for the object you want, click on Recalculate
as shown in the following screenshot:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 243 ]
Criteria-based sharing
Criteria-based sharing rules are used to control which users have access to records based on
specified field values on the records. For example, the account object has a custom picklist
field named Market. You can create a criteria-based sharing rule that shares all accounts in
which the Market field is set to US with, say, a North American Sales team in your
organization as shown in the following screenshot:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 244 ]
Although criteria-based sharing rules are based on values in the records and not the record
owners, a role or territory hierarchy still allows users higher in the hierarchy to access the
records.
You can create criteria-based sharing rules for Account, Opportunity, Case, Contact, and
Custom object.
For example, a custom object has been created for Newsletter. You can create a criteria-
based sharing rule that shares all newsletters in which the name is set to International with
the International Sales team in your organization as follows:

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 245 ]
Text and text area fields must be specified exactly, as they are case sensitive. For example, a
criteria-based sharing rule that specifies International in a text field would not share
records with International in the field.
Criteria-based sharing rule with text fields
To create a criteria-based sharing rule that matches with several cases of a
word, enter each value separated by a comma. For example,
International, international, and use the contains operator.
There is a restriction on the type of field that can be used for sharing as part of the Criteria-
based sharing. Along with record types, the following list of fields can be set as criteria for
sharing:
Auto Number, Checkbox, Date, Date/Time, E-mail, Number, Percent, Phone, Picklist,
Text, Text Area, URL, and Lookup Relationship (to either User or Queue).
Up to 50 criteria-based sharing rules can be created per object.
Manual sharing rules
Users can manually share certain types of records with other users within the Salesforce
CRM application. Some objects that are shared automatically include access to all other
associated records. For example, if a user shares one of their account records, then the
granted user will also have access to all the opportunities and cases connected to that
account.
Manual sharing rules are generally used either on a one-off basis to share a record or
whenever there is difficulty trying to determine a consistent set of users, groups, and the
associated rules that would be involved as a part of an Organization-Wide Sharing setting.
To be able to grant sharing access for a record, the user must either be the record owner, a
system administrator, a user in a role above the owner in the hierarchy, or any user that has
been granted full access; or the Organization-Wide settings for that object must allow access
through hierarchies.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 246 ]
Users grant access simply by clicking on the Sharing button found on the Record Detail
page as shown in the following screenshot:
The Sharing button does not appear if the object's Organization-Wide
Sharing Defaults are set to Public Read/Write.
Manual Sharing for user records
You can specify whether the Sharing button, used to grant others access to the user's own
user record, is displayed on user detail pages.
To hide or display the user Sharing button for all users, navigate to Setup | Security
Controls | Sharing Settings. Now click Edit in the Organization-Wide Defaults area and
scroll to the bottom of the page.
To hide or display the Sharing button on user detail pages select the Manual User Record
Sharing checkbox, as shown in the following screenshot, and then click Save.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 247 ]
Queues
Queues allow groups of users to manage shared records.
A Queue is a location where records can be routed to await processing by a group member.
The records remain in the queue until a user accepts them for processing or they are
transferred to another queue.
When creating a new queue, you must specify the set of objects that are stored. Permitted
objects for queues are leads, cases, service contracts, and custom objects. You must also
specify the set of users that are allowed to retrieve records from the queue.
Records can be added to a queue either manually or through an automatic case or lead
assignment rules upon which the owner of the record is changed to that of the queue.
Once records are added to a queue they remain there until they are either assigned to a user
or retrieved by one of the queue members. Then the owner of the record is changed to the
respective queue member user. Here, any queue member or any user located above a queue
member in the role hierarchy can take ownership of records in a queue.
Sharing access diagram
Many security options work together to determine whether users can view or edit a record.
First, Salesforce checks whether the user's profile has object level permission to access that
object. Then, Salesforce checks whether the user's profile has any administrative
permissions, such as View All Data or Modify All Data.
The View All Data profile or permission set assignment allows the user to
read all records and the Modify All Data profile or permission set
assignment allows the user to update and delete records regardless of the
data access security model of that object type.
Finally, Salesforce will check the ownership of the record. Here, the OWDs, role-level
access, and any sharing rules will be checked to see if there are any rules that give the user
access to that record.

Securing Access to Data and Data Validation
[ 248 ]
The following flow diagram shows how users are affected by the different security options
associated with record ownership and sharing models and rules that can be set:
In addition to the check to determine whether a user can view a record, shown in the
previous screenshot, their profile (or permission set) must be set with the view permission
for the relevant object.
In addition to the check to determine whether a user can edit a record, shown in the
previous screenshot, their profile (or permission set) must be set with the edit permission
for the relevant object.

Summary
In this chapter, we described the features that provide data access and security
configuration for system administrators and their levels of data access. Organization-Wide
Sharing Defaults, Roles, and other sharing settings were described.
We looked at how the access to records could be further widened through the use of
Permission Sets, Sharing Rules, criteria-based sharing, and also manual sharing.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the areas of Security and Access.
In the next chapter, we will be looking at ways of loading and extracting data from
Salesforce CRM, where we will look at the utilities available for importing and exporting
data to and from Salesforce. Included in the next chapter is a look at Data Loader and the
data import wizards.

Managing Data in Salesforce
CRM
In the previous chapter, we looked at the features that provide data access and security
configuration by system administrators and discussed the four main levels where data
access and security can be applied, namely: organization level, object level, field level, and
finally, at the record level.
In this chapter, we will discuss the options for improving data quality using data validation
rules and dependent fields. We will also outline the features and tools available within
Salesforce CRM that allow you to import and export data into and out of the Salesforce
system.
Finally, we will address a number of questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the area of data management.
The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
Data quality
Data validation rules
Dependent picklists
Data import and export utilities
Data Import Wizard
Individual import wizards
Data Loader

Data storage utilization
Now let's begin by looking at the key features available for you to help control the data that
users enter into the Salesforce CRM system.
Data quality
In Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps, we looked at how we can set the required field
and auto number field properties on custom fields to help improve the quality and maintain
the data integrity of records in the system.
Salesforce also provides other data quality mechanisms, such as:
Data validation rules
Dependent picklists
Data validation rules
Data validation rules can be applied to both custom and standard fields and are used to
verify that the data entered in a record meets the criteria you have specified before the 
record can be saved.
Validation rules contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more
fields and returns a value of either true or false.
The logic that is used for validation rules is to seek an error condition, upon which a pre-
configured error message is shown to the user whenever the formula or expression returns
a value of true.
When validation rules are defined for a field or set of fields, the following actions are fired
when the user creates a new record, or edits an existing record and then clicks on the Save
button:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 255 ]
Salesforce executes the validation rules and if all data is valid, the record is saved
For any invalid data, Salesforce displays the associated error message without
saving the record
You can specify the error message to display when a validation rule gets fired, along with
the option to either show the error message inline next to a field or at the top of the page.
For example, your error message could be The close date must occur after today's date. As
stated you can choose to display the error message at the top of the page or near a field
which you can select; this can be the field that is causing the validation rule to fire, which is
typical, or you can choose a different field. Like all other Salesforce error messages,
validation rule errors are displayed in red text and are preceded by the word Error.
Validation rules apply to all new and updated records for an object. If your organization
has multiple page layouts for the object on which you create a validation rule, you should
verify that the validation rule operates as expected on each layout. Also, if you have any
data integrations that affect the object, then you should also verify that the validation rule
operates as intended.
Even if the fields referenced in the validation rule are not visible on the
page layout, the validation rules still apply and will result in an error
message if the rule criteria are met.
To begin using validation rules, navigate to Setup | Customize. For standard objects, go to
the appropriate activity, standard object, or user's link from the menu, and click on
Validation Rules.
For custom objects, navigate to Setup | Create | Objects. Now go to the custom object.
Validation rules are listed in the Validation Rules list.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 256 ]
To begin adding a new validation rule, click on the New button in the Validation Rules
section, as shown in the following screenshot:
Now enter the properties of your validation rule, which should include the properties
detailed in the following section:
Field description section
Add a Rule Name, which is a unique identifier of up to 80 characters, with no spaces or
special characters (such as extended characters).
The Active checkbox, which is used to set the rule, is enabled.
Fill in the Description field, which is an optional 255 characters (or fewer) textbox that you
can set to describe the purpose of the validation rule.
Error condition formula section
The formula that is entered here forms the expression used to validate the field.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 257 ]
Error message section
The Error Message field is the text to be displayed to the user when a record update fails
the validation rule.
The Error Location is used to determine where on the page the error is displayed to the
user. Options available are as follows:
Top of Page
Field
The Top of Page option sets the error message to be displayed at the top of the page. To
display the error next to a field, choose the Field option and then select the appropriate
field.
If the error location is a field, the validation rule is also listed on the Detail page of that
field.
You can click on Check Syntax to check your formula for errors. Finally, click on Save to
finish or Save & New to create additional validation rules.
As an example, the following formula text shows an opportunity validation rule to ensure
that users cannot enter a date in the past into the Close Date field:
The formula would be: CloseDate < TODAY()
If the error location is set to a field that is later deleted, or a field that is
read-only or not visible on the page layout, Salesforce automatically
changes the error location to Top of Page.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 258 ]
An example error message for this validation rule is Close Date Must Be a Future Date, as
shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 259 ]
The validation rule will be fired when the preceding formula is true and will present the
error message as per the preceding example, as shown in the following screenshot:
Dependent picklists
Dependent picklists help to make data more accurate and consistent by applying filters.
A dependent field works in conjunction with a controlling field to filter its values. The value
chosen in the controlling field affects the values in the dependent field.
In the following screenshot, we see the Speaker Status field being controlled by the
Speaker Event Status field:
Dependent and controlling picklists
Dependent and controlling picklists work in conjunction where the value chosen in the
controlling picklist dynamically changes the values available in the dependent picklist.
Both controlling and dependent picklists are indicated on the edit pages by an icon. By
hovering the mouse over these icons, users can see the name of the controlling or dependent
picklist.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 260 ]
To define a dependent picklist, navigate to the Fields area of the appropriate object.
For standard objects, navigate to Setup | Customize. Now select the appropriate object
from the Customize menu and click on Fields.
For custom objects, navigate to Setup | Create | Objects. Now select one of the custom
objects in the list.
For custom task and event fields, navigate to Setup | Customize | Activities | Activity
Custom Fields.
Now click on the Field Dependencies in the Custom Fields & Relationships section, as
shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 261 ]
Now click on New to navigate to the New Field Dependency screen and then choose a
Controlling Field and a Dependent Field, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on Continue to display the next screen, where you are presented with the field
dependency matrix to specify the dependent picklist values that are available when a user
selects each controlling field value.
The field dependency matrix lets you specify which dependent picklist values will be
available when a user selects each controlling field value. The top row of the matrix shows
the controlling field values, while the columns show the dependent field values.
Using this matrix, you can include or exclude values. Included values are available in the
dependent picklist when a value in the controlling field is selected and excluded fields are
not available.
Here you can include or exclude values by performing the following steps:
Double-click values to include them. Included values are then

To work with more than one value, you should press and hold the Shift key and
2.
click on each value to select the required range of values, as shown in the
following screenshot:
After selecting the values, click on Include Values to make the values available, or click on
Exclude Values to remove them from the list of available values.
You can also press and hold the Ctrl key and click on the individual values to select
multiple values. Again, clicking on Include Values makes the values available, and clicking
on Exclude Values removes them from the list of available values. By clicking a column
header, you can select all the values in that column, as follows:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 263 ]
To change the values in your view, you can do the following:
Click on View All to view all available values at once
Click on Go To and choose a controlling value to view all the dependent values
in that column
Click on Previous or Next to view the values in columns that are on the previous
or next page
Click on View sets of 5 to view five columns at a time
Optionally, click on Preview to test your selections before clicking Save

Controlling picklist restrictions and limitations
There are various restrictions and limitations associated with the creation and configuration
of dependent and controlling Picklist fields.
Controlling ﬁelds restrictions and limitations
There are various nuances associated with the creation and configuration of dependent and
controlling fields. The following restrictions and limitations exist for controlling fields:
Standard Picklist fields can be controlling fields
Checklist fields can be controlling fields
Default values can be set for controlling fields
Multi-select Picklist fields cannot be controlling fields
There is a maximum of 300 values allowed in a controlling field
Dependent ﬁelds restrictions and limitations
The following restrictions exist for dependent fields:
Standard Picklist fields cannot be dependent fields
Checkboxes cannot be dependent fields
Default values cannot be set for dependent fields
Multi-select Picklist fields can be dependent picklists
Converting ﬁelds
When converting existing fields to dependent picklists or controlling fields, this can be done
without affecting the existing values in records. Only for changes going forward are the
dependency rules applied to the updates to existing records or new records.
Page layouts
For best practice and improved user visibility, make sure the dependent picklist is lower on
the page layout than its controlling field.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 265 ]
If a dependent picklist is required and no values are available for it based on the controlling
field value, users can save the record without entering a value. In this scenario, the record is
saved with no value for that field.
Make sure controlling fields are added to any page layouts that contain
their associated dependent picklists. If the controlling field is not on the
same page layout, the dependent picklist shows no available values.
Record types
The values in controlling fields are determined by the pre-selected record type and the
values in dependent picklists are determined by both the record type and the selected
controlling field value.
The values available in dependent picklists are, therefore, an intersection of the pre-selected
record type and subsequent controlling field selection.
Importing data
The data import utilities do not consider field dependencies unless the picklist value has the
Strictly enforce picklist values option enabled.
Therefore, any value can be imported into a dependent picklist field, regardless of the value
imported for a controlling field.
The Strictly enforce picklist values setting within the setup screen for a
picklist field prevents the field from allowing values that are not specified
in the picklist options, even if the field is updated through the API. See
Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps, for more details about field types.
An overview of data import and export
utilities
Salesforce provides data utilities, which are available to import and export data to and from
Salesforce. There is also a wide variety of third-party tools that allow data to be imported to
and exported from Salesforce and use the publicly available Salesforce APIs to provide the
data integration.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 266 ]
The third-party data import and export tools are not provided by Salesforce; therefore, we
will not be covering these in this book. However, you can locate and find information about
these tools via the AppExchange, a website provided by Salesforce that enables
organizations to select additional apps to extend Salesforce CRM. The AppExchange is
covered in detail in Chapter 9, Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM, and can be accessed
at the web URL: h t t p s ://a p p e x c h a n g e . s a l e s f o r c e . c o m .
Looking at the available Salesforce-provided facilities for importing and exporting data, we
have the following specific options:
Data Import Wizard
Individual import wizards
Import Accounts/Contacts
Import Leads
Import Solutions
Import Custom Objects
Data Loader
At the time of writing, Salesforce has announced that the individual
import wizards are to be retired in February 2017. Salesforce recommends
users to use the Data Import Wizard instead as the individual import
wizards will no longer be available starting from the Spring '17 release.
Data Import Wizard
Data Import Wizard opens in a full browser window and provides a unified interface that
lets you import data for a number of standard Salesforce objects, including Account,
Contact, Leads, CustomObject, and Solution.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 267 ]
To access Data Import Wizard, navigate to Setup | Data Management | Data Import
Wizard. Now click on the Launch Wizard button, as shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 268 ]
Individual import wizards
Salesforce individual import wizards open in a small pop-up window and present an easy-
to-use multi-step wizard for importing new Account (Person and Business Accounts),
Contact, Leads, Custom Object, or Solution Object records into Salesforce.
At the time of writing, Salesforce has announced that the individual
import wizards are to be retired in February 2017. Salesforce recommends
users to use the Data Import Wizard instead as the individual import
wizards will no longer be available starting from the Spring '17 release.
To access the individual import wizards, click on the tab for the required object and locate
the Tools section at the bottom of the page. As an example, the Leads import wizard is
located as shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 269 ]
The wizard can also be used for Account (Person and Business Accounts), Contact, Leads,
Custom Object, or Solution updates based on a matching identifier.
Contact and Leads can be updated by matching the e-mail address, and
Custom Object or Solution may be updated based on custom object
names, solution titles, Salesforce ID, or an external ID.
A comma-separated value (CSV) file format is required when using the import wizard
where imports are limited to 50,000 records per session.
Account and Contact import wizards have a built-in de-duplicating
functionality. Account can be matched using the account name and
account site. For Contact, de-duplicating matching can be carried out
using first name, last name, or e-mail address.
Data Loader
Data Loader is a client application available from Salesforce, which provides the facilities to
bulk import and export data. Using Data Loader, you can create, edit, and delete Salesforce
records for both standard and custom objects. Data Loader is supported for Windows XP,
Windows 7, and Mac OS X.
The Data Loader client application must first be installed onto your local machine. The
installation files can be obtained by navigating to Setup | Data Management | Data
Loader.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 270 ]
Within the Data Loader installation files download screen, you can choose the appropriate
installation download link for your operating system using either Download Data Loader
for Windows or Download Data Loader for Mac, as shown in the following screenshot:
Data Loader can create, edit, or delete records for both standard and custom objects in
Salesforce CRM. When importing data, Data Loader loads data from (CSV) files (or from a
database connection). When exporting data, Data Loader exports records into CSV files.
The CSV files can then be edited or used as data-key templates for data imports into
Salesforce.
Commas are commonly used to separate field values; however, since
commas are used in certain locales as a way of formatting currency or
numeric values, the comma delimiter may not be appropriate for every
locale. In this scenario, users can specify delimiters such as tab, colon, or
any other character delimiter.
The Data Loader client application provides the following features:
A simple-to-use interactive wizard interface providing drag-and-drop field
mapping between the source and destination data fields
Support for importing and exporting large data files with anything upto five
million records
Support for all Salesforce objects, which includes both standard and custom
objects

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 271 ]
Post-processing log files showing error and success results in CSV format, along
with a built-in CSV file reader
For the Windows operating system only, a command-line interface to enable
automated importing and exporting of Salesforce data
Data Loader does not support the export of attachments. Instead,
Salesforce recommends using the weekly export feature described later in
this chapter to export attachments.
Data Loader and import wizards compared
With Data Loader, you can perform operations such as insert, delete, update, extract, or
upsert. You can move data into or out of any Salesforce object. There is less validation when
adding data.
The import wizards are more limited as they only support Account, Contact, Leads,
Solution, and Custom object. However, they have built-in de-duplication logic.
As a general guide, use Data Loader when:
You need to load 50,000 or more records, up to the maximum of five million
records
You need to load into an object that is not yet supported by web-based import
wizards
You want to schedule regular data loads, such as nightly imports
You want to save mappings for later use
You want to export your data for backup purposes
Add your IP address in the list of trusted IP ranges:
When logging into Data Loader, you must add a security token as
described in Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps. However, by adding
your IP address as an entry in the list of trusted IP ranges, you can log in
with only your Salesforce username and password.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 272 ]
As a general guide, use web-based import wizards when:
You are loading fewer than 50,000 records
The object you need to import is an Account, Contact, Leads, Solution, or
Custom object
You want to prevent duplicates by uploading records according to account name
and site, contact e-mail address, or lead e-mail address
Should you need to load more than five million records, Salesforce
recommends that you work with a Salesforce partner, either directly or by
visiting the AppExchange (covered in Chapter 9, Extending and Enhancing
Salesforce CRM), where you will find a number of suitable products.
Best practices for mass data updating
When carrying out any kind of mass data update or deletion in Salesforce CRM, you should
ensure that the data to be changed is correct, but you should also consider applying the
following best practices.
Back up data
Back up your data before performing a mass update, or delete it by either requesting a data
export or exporting your own report of the data.
Test batch
Create a test file containing a few records first to ensure that your source data has been
correctly prepared.
Mass deleting data:
Consider including both the Date/Time Stamp and Created by Alias
criteria in your mass delete to ensure that you are only deleting your
imports and no other data.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 273 ]
Export backup data
Your organization can sign up to receive backup files of your data. Here, you can export all
your organization's data into a set of CSV files.
With the data export feature, you can generate backup files manually once every six days or
schedule them to generate automatically at weekly or monthly intervals.
The weekly export service is available in Enterprise Edition and Unlimited
Edition. The Developer Edition provides a monthly export service. When
the export is ready, you will receive an e-mail with a link; navigate to the
link provided.
To schedule a weekly or monthly export (as governed by the edition of Salesforce CRM that
you are using), navigate to Setup | Data Management | Data Export. Then click on either
the Export Now or Schedule Export buttons, as shown in the following screenshot:
The data export can be set to run immediately or scheduled to run in the future, as
discussed in the following subsections.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 274 ]
Export Now
The Export Now option prepares your files for immediate export. This option is only
available if a week has passed since your last export and presents the options shown in the
following screenshot:
Schedule Export
The Schedule Export option allows you to schedule the export process for weekly or
monthly intervals and presents the options shown in the following screenshot:

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 275 ]
If new objects are created in the org after the Data Export has been
scheduled you must then reschedule the data export to include the newly
created objects if you want them to be included in the data export.

The Recycle Bin can be accessed from the Home tab by clicking on the link in the sidebar as
shown in the following screenshot:
The Recycle Bin is where deleted data is stored. It can be accessed for 15 days, after which
the data becomes permanently deleted and is no longer recoverable.
Clicking on Recycle Bin allows you to view both your deleted items and your
organization's deleted items, as shown in the following screenshot:
You can use the Empty your recycle bin button to permanently remove deleted items prior
to the 15-day expiration.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 277 ]
Records in the Recycle Bin do not count against your organizations
storage limits.
To calculate the number of records that your Recycle Bin can store, Salesforce uses the
following formula: 25 multiplied by the number of Megabytes (MB) in your storage.
For example, if your organization has 1 GB, which equates to 1000 MB (a 1000 MB storage
unit is used here and not 1028 MB), your limit is 25 multiplied by 1000 MB, which equals
25,000 records.
When your organization reaches the Recycle Bin limit, the Salesforce CRM application
automatically removes the oldest records (if they have been in the Recycle Bin for at least
two hours).
Data storage utilization
Salesforce CRM has two categories of storage, namely, data, which is used to store records
(for example, Opportunity, Account, or Custom object data records), and file storage, which
is used to store file attachments (for example, presentations, spreadsheets, images, PDFs,
and so on).
Salesforce CRM (Enterprise Edition) provides, as a minimum, 1 GB for data storage and 11
GB for file storage. In total, this 12 GB storage amount (1 GB for data plus 11 GB for files) is
the minimum total storage allocated for a Salesforce CRM organization. However, the
storage amount increases as more active users are added, since there is also a 20-MB-per-
user for data and 2-GB-per-user for files storage factor.
As an example, an organization with 500 active users sees the storage amount for data
increase to 10 GB. This is calculated as 500 (users) multiplied by 20 MB, which equals 10,000
MB or 10 GB. The storage amount for files is increased to 1,000 GB (500 users multiplied by
2 GB).
To view your organization's used data space and used file space, navigate to Setup | Data
Management | Storage Usage. Here, you can view the limits and used amounts for data
and file storage, the amounts in use per record type, and the current file-storage usage. You
can also view the top users of data and file storage. To see exactly what is being stored by a
listed user, you can click that user's name.

Questions to test your knowledge
You are now presented with questions about the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the areas of data management which have been covered in this chapter.
The answers can be found at the end of the chapter.
Questions
We present six questions to verify your understanding of data validation, dependent
picklists, data importing and exporting facilities, and Recycle Bin storage.
Question 1 – Data validation rules
A validation rule has been created to ensure that users do not set the Close Date of an
opportunity to a date in the past. What will happen if a user attempts to save an
opportunity record that has a Close Date from last year? (Select one):
a) The error message defined within the validation rule is displayed on the record after the
record is saved
b) The error message defined within the validation rule is sent by e-mail to the user after
the record is saved

[ 280 ]
Question 6 – Recycle Bin
How many days will the Recycle Bin store deleted data? (Select one):
a) 5
b) 10
c) 15
d) 30
Answers
Here are the answers to the six questions about data validation, dependent picklists, data
importing and exporting facilities, and Recycle Bin storage.
Answer 1 – Data Validation rules
The answer is a) Data Validation rules allows you to specify your own business-specific
criteria to prevent users from saving invalid data in one or more fields. In this scenario, if a
user enters an invalid Close Date (one in the past), the error message defined within the
validation rule is displayed on the record and the record is not saved.
Answer 2 – Dependent fields
The answer is a) Multi-select picklists can be dependent picklists, and d) Custom picklist
fields can be dependent fields. Multi-select picklists can be dependent picklists but cannot
be controlling fields. Checkbox fields can be controlling fields but cannot be dependent
fields. Standard picklist fields can be controlling fields but cannot be a dependent field.
Custom picklist fields can be used as either a controlling field or a dependent field.
Answer 3 – Data Import Wizard
The answer is c) Opportunity is the object type in the list that cannot be imported using the
Data Import Wizard.

Managing Data in Salesforce CRM
[ 281 ]
Answer 4 – Data Import Wizard features
The answer is b) Prevent duplicate records from being imported, and d) Prevent workflow
rules from firing as records are loaded into the system. The Data Import Wizard can be
used to import accounts, contacts, leads, solutions, and custom object records; prevent
duplicate records from being imported; import up to 50,000 records; choose whether to
allow workflow rules to fire during the loading of data.
Answer 5 – Data Loader and import wizards compared
The answer is b) Data Loader. Neither the Data Import Wizard nor the Individual Import
Wizard supports the importing of Case records.
Answer 6 – Recycle Bin
The answer is c) Deleted data is stored in the Recycle Bin, where it can be accessed for 15
days, after which the data becomes permanently deleted and is no longer recoverable.
Summary
In this chapter, we described the features that offer improvements to data quality through
the use of data validation rules and dependent fields.
We also looked at the options and facilities available within Salesforce CRM for importing
and exporting data into and out of the system. We briefly outlined the data storage feature
in Salesforce, along with texporting backup data and the Recycle Bin.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce CRM
administration in the area of data management.
In the following chapter, we will be covering data analytics, where we will see how we can
report on the data in Salesforce.
Included in the next chapter is the setting up of reports, dashboards, custom reports, and a
discussion of how to use the Report Builder.

Generating Data Analytics with
Reports and Dashboards
In the previous chapter, we looked at the various mechanisms in Salesforce CRM that help
manage the quality and integrity of data. The previous chapter also outlined the features
and tools that are available for importing and exporting data to and from Salesforce CRM.
In this chapter, We will continue to look at the subject of data, but from the viewpoint of
reporting, We will describe the analytics building blocks within Salesforce CRM.
These analytics tools allow you and your users to customize and manage the reporting and
visual representation of data. For example, the sales team can produce reports that show the
sales pipeline, the marketing team can report on the progress of campaigns, and you can
create reports that display the number of active users in your Salesforce organization. The
features available to report data are described in detail, including details on how to create,
customize, and export purpose-built report data. Reports can also be used to improve the
quality of data. You can, for example, create a report that lists all accounts with missing
annual revenue fields.
We will also look in detail at how these analytical elements can be used to provide
sophisticated dashboard charting and graphics.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 283 ]
Salesforce CRM analytics consist of the basic mechanisms of reports, dashboards, and
folders:
Reports: Reports are the key building blocks for analytics in Salesforce CRM,
where a resulting set of records are displayed in rows and columns to match the
specified criteria. Report results may be further filtered and grouped, and may
also be displayed as graphical summaries.
Dashboards: Dashboards are visual Components generated from data in reports.
These Components can include the following five types: charts, gauges, tables,
metrics, and Visualforce pages.
Folders: Folders are used to store the reports and dashboards and can be set to
either read-only or read/write. To configure which of your users have access to a
folder, you can set it to be accessible by all users, hidden from all users, or
accessible only by certain users. When restricting to certain users, options exist to
restrict by Public Groups, Roles, and Roles and Subordinates.
Reports
Within Salesforce CRM, reports are accessed from the Reports tab (as shown in the
following screenshot). There is a large variety of predefined reports that are automatically
provided when your organization is first set up by Salesforce. These predefined reports are
known as standard reports and are located in pre-prepared report folders known as
standard report folders. For example, standard reports provide information about accounts
and contacts; details about opportunities, forecasts, products, and sales pipelines;
information about your organizations leads; details about forecast reports for customizable
forecasting, and so on.
In this section on reports, we will outline the available standard reports and describe some
of the key reports for system administrators in particular.
The predefined reports are suitable for existing objects and fields. They would not  be
suitable for reporting on any new objects that you have created. For this, we will look at
how to extend the existing reports and how to create completely new types of reports,
which are known as custom report types in Salesforce CRM.
Texisting objects and fields. They would are not be suitable for reporting on any new objects
that you have created. For this, we will look at how to extend the existing reports and how
to create completely new types of reports, known in Salesforce CRM as custom report types.
When building reports from either standard or custom report types, Salesforce provides a
full-featured drag-and-drop editor to simplify the setup and layout of reports.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 284 ]
We will first look at how to use report folders, which can help organize and control users
access to reports within Salesforce CRM. When we click on the Reports tab, the Reports and
Dashboards home page presents the following features:
This represents the New Report and New Dashboard buttons.
1.
This represents the Folders search box, which allows users to search for specific

filtering of Recent Reports tabs, displays appropriate reports, and allows the
creation of new reports.
These features can be identified by their respective number, as shown in the  following
screenshot:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 285 ]
Report and Dashboard Folders
The Report and Dashboards Folders section allows you and your users to select the reports
and dashboards that are stored in that specific folder.
In Salesforce CRM, you cannot save reports to the standard report folders. You can save
reports to the My Personal Custom Reports folder, the Unfiled Public Reports
folder, or any custom report folder where you have the appropriate read/write access.
Standard reports may not be deleted or removed, but the folder and the
standard report type, described further on in this chapter, can be hidden.
Creating new report and dashboard folders
Using the create folder icon and associated options allows you to create new report and
dashboard folders for custom reports and dashboards, as shown in the following
screenshot:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 286 ]
The option to create new folders is not available to all users. The user permission required
to access the Create New Folder option is Manage Public Reports.
It is good practice to create new folders to help manage the structure of
reports for your organization.
You cannot mix standard and custom reports in the same folder.
Keep favorite report folders in view
The reports and dashboards folder pane may contain many report and dashboard folders,
which means your users have to scroll up and down the list to find the required folder. To
help users keep their favorite folders at the top of the list, they can pin report and
dashboard folders to the top of the folder list. This can be done by clicking to the right of the
folder name and selecting the Pin to top option, as shown in the following screenshot:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 287 ]
Unlike many IT systems, creating reports in Salesforce CRM is very simple; users can create
reports themselves. Since it is so easy for users to create reports, without careful control and
an organized approach to report creation, it is easy for the number of reports to rapidly
increase and become difficult to manage. You should, for example, create report folders that
only certain users have access to. This could be restricted to certain departments or
geographical regions. For example, reports could be restricted to Global Marketing or to the
North American Sales Team.
To create new report folders, click on the New Report Folder option, where the New
Report Folder page is presented, as shown in the following screenshot:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 288 ]
Here, you provide the name of the report folder and decide whether the public folder access
is set to be read-only or read/write. You can optionally move reports from the Unfiled
Public Reports folder. You must specify the accessibility to users. You can select either
the accessible by all users, hidden from all users, or accessible by certain users options.
These options are available in the following: Public Groups, Roles, and Roles and
Subordinates.
Only users with the Manage Public Reports user permission are able to
delete reports from the report folders. This is true even if the user has
read/write access and has created the report themselves.
Enhanced sharing for reports and dashboards
This setting lets users share reports and dashboards with other users, roles, or public user
groups. When it is activated, Salesforce converts the existing public report folder access
levels described previously, whereupon access to folders is then derived from the
combination of folder access and user permissions.
The enhanced access levels grants all users as a Viewer (by default) to the
report and dashboard folders that are shared with them.
To activate enhanced sharing for reports and dashboards, navigate to Setup | Reports &
Dashboards | Customize | Folder Sharing. Select the Enable access levels for sharing
report and dashboard folders checkbox and then click Save.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 289 ]
Users are then able to share the reports and dashboards folders by clicking to the right of
the folder in the folders pane and selecting the Share option, as shown in the following
screenshot:
When users click the Share option, they are presented with a new screen that allows them
to set the sharing access for other users. The options are Viewer, Editor, or Manager, as
shown in the following screenshot:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 290 ]
Viewer access
The Viewer access setting allows users to view, refresh, and run reports and dashboards.
Editor access
The Editor access setting provides the same access as Viewer plus the ability to edit, move,
save, and delete reports and dashboards.
Manager access
The Manager access setting provides the same access as Editor plus the ability to share and
rename the folder.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 291 ]
Creating reports
The basic steps for creating new reports are as follows:
From the Reports tab, click on the New Report… button.
1.
Select the report type for the report and click on the Create button.
2.
Customize your report, enter a report name, and then save or run it.
3.
Report name on two lines:
It is possible to format the report name to be split onto two lines to help
make it easier to show the name. This can be done by entering the colon (:)
character. Simply enter the report name with a colon character, for
example, A01 North America: April Sales and the report name will be
shown on two lines when viewing the report.
Caution: this is a non-documented feature so may not be supported by
Salesforce.
Selecting the appropriate report type is one of the most important steps in creating a report.
Report types set the rules for which records can be shown in reports. They allow predefined
sets of records and fields to be available within a report based on the relationship between a
primary object and any related objects.
Best practices for reports:
Establish a report naming convention, for example, A01 NA April Sales,
B02 INT April Sales, and so on, as this can make it easier to refer to reports
using the coding scheme (there is an upper limit of 40 characters). Use the
Description field to describe exactly what the report is intended for (there
is an upper limit of 255 characters). Consider creating reports that are only
needed for dashboards in separate report folders, called something like
Dashboard Reports Sales, for example. Perform regular spring cleans
where you delete unwanted reports. You can also create temporary
reports that are hidden from all users and save these reports there while
you figure out if they are required.
In the Salesforce CRM application, there are standard report types, and you, as system
administrator, can set up custom report types.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 292 ]
Terminology check:
Custom Report Type is different from Custom Report in Salesforce CRM.
When users create a new report using the New Report button on the
Reports home page, this is sometimes known as a custom report. Custom
Report Type is a report template that only system administrators can
create. It provides a custom set of associated objects and fields to produce
predefined report templates from which any users custom report can be
created.
Standard report types
Salesforce provides a large range of predefined standard report types along with standard
report folders accessible from the Reports tab, as shown in the following table:

From the Create New Report screen, the creation of standard reports in Salesforce CRM
begins with the selection of an appropriate report type, as shown in the following
screenshot:
By default, the standard report folders are set to read-only and are accessible by all users.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 294 ]
Administrative reports
One of the most useful standard reports for system administrators is the administrator
report, which can be found in the Administrative Reports folder, and can be used to
analyze your Salesforce users documents, reports, and login locations. For example, you can
run reports on the active Salesforce users and see who has been logging in. The following
administrative reports are available:
Report
Description
All Active Users
Lists the active users in your organization and when they last
logged in
Users Logged in This Week Lists all users who have logged in to Salesforce in the past seven
days
Documents
Lists the documents within each document folder
New Login Locations
List of users, IP addresses, and login dates
Creating a custom report to list your organizations reports:
You can create a custom report that lists the reports within your
organization and the last time each report was used. Choose
Administrative Reports and then select Reports as the report type.
Hiding standard report types
There is a large number of standard report types provided by Salesforce and presented in
the Create New Report page. Some of the report types may not be of any value in your
organization and only serve to clutter up the list of useful report types. You can hide
unwanted standard report types from users by enabling the Select Report Types to Hide
checkbox to reveal a check mark or cross mark against each of the report types.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 295 ]
The green check mark next to a report type means it is visible. Clicking the check mark to
change it to an cross mark means it is hidden, as shown in the following screenshot:
 
Hidden report types do not show up when using the search box on the
Create New Report page, and if you hide all the report types in a folder,
the folder becomes hidden too.
Custom report types
In addition to the standard report types, you can also create custom report types. Custom
report types extend the types of reports from which all users in your organization can create
or update custom reports.
Creating custom report types
Custom report types are set up using the following steps:
Define a custom report type by name, description, primary object, development
1.
status, and the category of report to store it.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 296 ]
Choose the related objects for the custom report type.
2.
Specify the layout for the resulting standard and custom fields that a report can
3.
display when created using the custom report type.
Create a report from the Custom Report Type template to verify that all of the
4.
objects and field definitions are correct.
Once you have created a custom report type, you can later update or delete it, as required.
When a Custom Report Type template is deleted, any reports that have
been created from it are also deleted. Furthermore, any dashboard
Components that have been created from a report that was created from a
deleted Custom Report Type template will show an error message when
viewed.
Defining custom report types
To navigate to the Custom Report Types page, navigate to Setup | Create | Report Types.
Then click on New Custom Report Type:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 297 ]
Step 1 – Deﬁning the Custom Report Type template
From the Primary Object drop-down list, select the primary object from which you want to
build your custom report type.
The primary object you choose determines the views available to users creating or running
reports from your custom report type. For example, if you select accounts as the primary
object for your custom report type, users can view their report results by All Accounts or
My Accounts from the report builders Show drop-down list.
If you select opportunities, when users create reports based on that report type, they can
view their report results by My opportunities, My teams opportunities, or by All
opportunities, as shown in the following screenshot:
When a Custom Report Type template is saved, the primary object associated with it
cannot be changed. So, if you later want to change the primary object, you have to define a
new custom report type.
Now enter the Report Type Label and the Report Type Name fields, and enter a
description for the custom report type. The description will be visible to users who create
reports and is used to help explain the purpose for the Custom Report Type template.
The Report Type Label field can be up to 50 characters and the
description can be up to 255 characters.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 298 ]
Select the category to store the custom report type in. Then, select a development status.
Here, you can select In Development when you first create the custom report type to hide it
from users while you define it. This will hide the Custom Report Type template and
prevent users from creating and running reports from the report type. Choose Deployed
when you have finished defining it and want to let users create and run reports using that
Custom Report Type template.
Now click on Next and choose the object relationships a report can display when run from a
custom report type.
Step 2 – Deﬁning report records set
After the initial definition of the Custom Report Type template, the object relationships for
it can be selected. These object relationships determine the objects and fields available for
display on reports. Using diagrams, they help to understand the object relationships formed
within Custom Report Type, which will display the data fields whenever reports are
created from the Custom Report Type  template:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 299 ]
In this Custom Report Type example, called Events with or without Sessions, we have
object relationships for a custom primary object Event which has relationships with
Sessions and Speakers.
To add an object that is associated with another object to the report type, click on the
rectangle section (Click to relate another object). Then, select the object from the picklist.
The objects available for you to choose from are based on the primary object's relationships
to other objects.
For example, our custom object, Event, is set as the primary object for the Custom Report
Type template, so only standard and custom objects associated with Events can be chosen,
such as Sessions. This also applies to additional objects added to the Custom Report Type
template. In our example, with Events selected as the primary object and Sessions
selected as the secondary object, only the objects associated with Sessions can be selected
as the third object on the Custom Report Type template, which is our custom object,
Speakers.
Although up to four object levels can be set up for Custom Report Type
templates, some of the object combinations may not be able to reach that
limit. For example, if you add contacts as the primary object, opportunities
as the secondary object, and activities as the third object, then you cannot
add any additional objects because activities do not have any child object
relationships.
Within the diagram, there is the option of setting the first relationship to the primary object
with either “A” records may or may not have related “B” records or Each “A” record must
have at least one related “B” record.
The following paragraph describes the effects of selecting may or may not options.
All subsequent objects automatically include the may-or-may-not association on the custom
report type. For example, if accounts are the primary objects and opportunities are the
secondary objects, and you choose that accounts may or may not have opportunities, then
any third and fourth level objects included on the CustomReportType template default to
may-or-may-not associations.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 300 ]
Blank fields display on report results for object B when object A does not have object B. For
example, if a user runs a report on accounts with or without opportunities, then
opportunity fields display as blank for accounts without opportunities.
Edit layout
After clicking on Save, the Custom Report Type definition and the object relationships are
set as shown in the following screenshot:
Now the layout can be edited to specify which standard and custom fields a report can
display when created or run from the template.

[ 301 ]
Clicking on Preview Layout shows which fields will display on the Select Columns page of
a report based on this report type.
To start configuring the layout, select fields from the right-hand box and drag them to a
section on the left, as shown in the following screenshot:
You can view a specific objects fields by selecting an object from the View drop-down list
and arrange fields within sections as they should appear to users.
Fields not dragged onto a section will not be visible to users when they create reports using
this report type.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 302 ]
You can add up to 1,000 fields to each Custom Report Type template.
To rename or set which fields are selected by default for users, select one or more fields and
click on Edit Properties, as shown in the following screenshot:
Click on the Checked by Default checkbox next to the field you want selected by default.
Change the text in the Display As field next to the field you want to rename. To rename the
sections, click on Edit next to an existing section or create a new section by clicking on
Create New Section. Then click on Save.
Any new fields that are created on the referenced object(s) are not
automatically added to the custom report type. If you want the new fields
to be available in the custom report type for users to select the you must
edit the custom report type and manually configure the fields.

Running reports
The Reports tab presents the reports home page, on which users can search for reports and
select or create a folder for reports:
The list of folders (represented by the folder icon) displays all the report folders that the
user has permission to access. Within this section, you can view, edit, and manage all of
your organization's public report folders. By clicking on the Reorder Folders option, you
can change the order in which folders appear on the sub-tab.
The section on the right displays the selected report folder and allows users to click on the
Actions drop-down, which appears as the first column. Here, the options are Edit, Delete,
and Export.
Choosing the Delete option will remove the report for all users and move it to the Recycle
Bin. Here, you are prompted with a warning before the deletion is carried out.
Before doing so, you need to check that the report is no longer required, as it will be
removed for all users you are able to recover it from the Recycle Bin for 15 days (if
necessary), though.
You cannot delete reports that are being used by dashboards. To delete
these reports, you must first delete the calling dashboard component.

Report considerations
There are various issues to consider when running reports, whether in Salesforce CRM or
on any other information system. There are typical limits to the volume of data that can be
processed, or restrictions to the types of changes that can be made to existing reports. Both
the method of controlling the amount of data that is returned in Salesforce and the effects of
changing aspects of existing reports are described next.

Reports that take longer than ten minutes to complete will be cancelled by
the Salesforce system.
Report timeout warning
The report timeout warning analyzes reports that are invoked from the Run Reports page.
The standard timeout for reports is ten minutes. If the report is identified to be highly
complex and is likely to time out, a warning is displayed.
The report timeout warning analyzes reports that are activated manually and ignores
reports run via dashboards or scheduled reports.
You can have the timeout period for reports extended from the default ten
minutes by sending a request to Salesforce customer support.
If your organization has extended the limit to, say, 20 minutes, the report timeout warning
might be less likely to appear. However, bear in mind that highly complex reports may still
time out in the future.
Salesforce recommends that you follow the steps outlined in their online
help section, Tips for Improving Report Performance, to simplify the report.

[ 307 ]
You can disable the report timeout warning by navigating to Setup | Customize | Reports
& Dashboards | User Interface Settings. Uncheck the Enable Report Timeout Warning
checkbox and then click on Save.
Exporting reports to the background
Exporting reports to the background enables you to run reports in the background so that
you can continue working in Salesforce without waiting for report results to be displayed.
Exporting reports to the background is very useful when creating large reports that would
otherwise time out due to the volume of resulting report data.
When the report has finished running and the results are ready for viewing, an e-mail
notification is sent by Salesforce. The email contains a link that, when clicked, enables the
viewing of the report information. From this page, you can then download the report
results in CSV format.
The feature for exporting reports to the background can only be enabled
by sending a request to Salesforce customer support.
User verification test
For security purposes, user verification can be set up to require users to be tested before
exporting data from the Salesforce CRM application. This text data-entry test prevents
automated programs from attempting to access the data from within Salesforce. This
feature is available on request from Salesforce customer support.
To pass the test, users must type the two words displayed into a textbox field and submit.
Note that the words entered into the textbox field must be separated by a space.
Salesforce uses CAPTCHA technology provided by reCAPTCHA for user-verification
testing.
CAPTCHA is an acronym that stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To
Tell Computers and Humans Apart. It is a computer data-entry verification that ensures
the entry is being carried out by a person. The verification requests the user to complete a
small test, which the computer creates first, and then checks the result. Because only
humans are able to solve the test, whenever the correct solution is returned, the computer
accepts that it is a request by a person and not an automated computer program.

Mass Deleting Reports
You can delete reports individually or use the Mass Delete Reports page to search and
select multiple reports to be deleted. This can be used to help declutter the list of reports on
the Reports tab and remove multiple reports that are no longer in use.
To mass delete reports, navigate to Setup | Data Management | Mass Delete Records and
then click the Mass Delete Reports link. Specify the criteria that the selected reports to be
deleted must match, for example, Report Name contains activity, and then click Search.
The list of any matching reports will then be presented. You can then select and click
Delete, as shown in the following screenshot:
You cannot mass delete other users personal reports, reports within
dashboards, or analytic snapshots.

Report builder
The report builder in Salesforce CRM is a visual editor to enable the creation and
modification of reports. The report builder interface uses drag-and-drop functionality to
configure reports, and the interface consists of the following three sections, known as panes:
The Fields pane
The Filters pane
The Preview pane
The following screenshot shows the report builder page, which is presented as a full-screen
window in order to maximize the display of the Fields, Filters, and Preview panes:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 310 ]
To exit the report builder editor page, click on the Close button located in the top-left corner
of the page, where you will be prompted to save any changes.
You can also click on the Salesforce logo in the top-left corner of the page. However, you
will not be prompted to save any changes. We will now look at each of the panes in detail,
beginning with the Fields pane.
The Fields pane
The Fields pane is shown on the left-hand side of the report builder page and, as the name
suggests, lists all the accessible fields in the selected report type. The list of fields is
organized by the sections that were set in the page layout of the associated report type.
Here, fields can easily be identified by using the Quick Find search box at the top of the
pane. You can also limit the number of fields shown by using the field type filters. In this
pane, the fields can be dragged into the Preview pane to add them to the report. Additional
calculated fields can be created just for the specific report. These are known as custom
summary formulas and buckets.
The Filters pane
To limit the number of rows of data results that are returned when you run a report, you
can either limit your report results by clicking on the Hide Details button at the top of the
report, or you can add custom filters. To restore the full set of returned data, click on the
Show Details button.
For Tabular reports (only), you can set the maximum number of records to be displayed by
clicking on Add Row Limit in the report builder accessed from the Add button in the
Filters pane.
The Filters pane is displayed in the top-right part of the report builder page, and is used to
configure the view, the time period, and also any custom filters to limit the data that is
actually displayed as part of the report.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 311 ]
Within the Filters pane, you click on the Add box to add report filters, as shown here:
Report filters set the criteria for the data in a report according to the following:
Report
filter
Description
Notes
Field Filter
Field Filter allows you to set the field,
the operator, and the value.
For example, Account Name equals
Acme.
Filter Logic Filter Logic adds Boolean conditions to
control how field filters are evaluated.
For example, Filter 1 and (Filter 2 OR
Filter 3).
You must add at least one field filter
before applying filter logic.
Cross Filter Cross Filter allows you to link fields on
related objects using a with or without
sub-filter.
For example, a cross filter on Accounts
with Opportunities allows you to
show only Accounts that have Closed
Won Opportunities.
Row Limit
With a Row Limit, you set the
maximum number of rows to be
displayed; choose a field to sort by and
the sort order.
Only available for Tabular reports.
Tabular reports that have a limited
row count can be used in dashboards.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 312 ]
The Preview pane
The Preview pane is where the report can be customized. You and your users can add,
rearrange, and remove columns, summary fields, formulas, and field groupings. When you
enter the report builder for the first time, the Preview pane shows an initial result to
provide a starting point from which the crafting and fine tuning of the report results can be
done. In the Preview pane, you can also set the required report format, which can be either
Tabular, Summary, or Matrix.
The preview shows only a limited number of result records. You need to actually run the
report in order to see all the results.
You can drag-and-drop report columns to change the order in which they are displayed. By
clicking on the data-column header, you can sort your report using that column. Sorting can
also be performed by clicking on the column menu and then choosing either the Sort
Ascending or the Sort Descending option from the drop-down list.
Sort is disabled when Show Details has not been selected.
If a field has been added to the preview pane and is not required, it can be removed by
grabbing its column header and dragging it back to the Fields pane. You can also click on
the column menu and choose Remove Column, or click on Remove All Columns to clear
the Preview pane of all the fields.
While Show Details is disabled, you can only add summary fields.
Setting the Date Range option to All Time:
When first creating a report involving dates, the date range may not
initially be set appropriately. So, there will be no obvious results returned.
By setting the date range to All Time, you will most probably see some
data returned, which can be useful as a quick check to see whether the
report is working as intended.
Report formats
The following four report formats are available in Salesforce CRM: Tabular, Summary,
Matrix, and Joined. The features and benefits of each format are outlined next.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 313 ]
The Tabular report format
Tabular reports are the easiest and quickest way to report data. They can be likened to a
spreadsheet, where they comprise a set of records listed in rows and fields (ordered in
columns). Tabular reports are best suited for creating lists of records or a list with a single
grand total, as they cannot be used to group data.
Tabular reports cannot be used in dashboards unless the number of rows
that are returned are limited.
The Summary report format
Summary reports are similar to tabular reports except that they allow the grouping of rows
of data. They can be used for reports to show subtotals based on the value of a field.
Summary reports with no groupings are simply displayed as tabular reports.
Summary reports can be used as the source report for dashboard
Components.
The Matrix report format
Matrix reports are similar to summary reports, but they also allow the grouping and
summarizing of data by both rows and columns and can be used for comparing related
totals.
Matrix reports are useful for summarizing large amounts of data to compare values in
several different fields or for analyzing data by date or by product, person, region, and so
on.
Matrix reports can be used as the source report for dashboard
Components.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 314 ]
The Joined report format
Joined reports are reports that can store and group multiple reports together and allow you
to build a single report that contains data from multiple report types.
A joined report can have up to five report blocks that can be added from either standard or
custom report types, but can only be included if they share a common object relationship.
For example, if you have a joined report that contains the Opportunities report type, you
can then add the Contacts report type, since both Opportunity and Contact objects have
a relationship with the Accounts object.
For joined reports with multiple report types, any field that is shared by all report types is
known as a common field. Common fields appear in the Common Fields area in the Fields
pane and can be used to group together the separate report blocks.
Joined reports can be used as the source report for dashboard Components
if the joined report includes a report chart by configuring the dashboard
component with the Use chart as defined in the source report setting. The
following features are not available in joined reports: Bucket fields, Cross
filters, The Rows to Display filters, and Conditional Highlighting.
Groupings
Groupings can be added to summary, matrix, and joined reports to group together sections
of report data. For example, you might want to group accounts by the number of employees
that the account has.
To add a summary field, follow these steps:
Drag a field from within the Fields pane.
1.
Drag the field into the grouping section of the Preview pane.
2.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 315 ]
Wait for the loading dialog to complete.
3.
Observe what the field is showing on the grouping section:
4.
This will produce a report showing the grouped sections, as shown in the following
screenshot:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 316 ]
Summary reports can have up to three grouping levels.
Matrix reports can have two row and two column groupings. You cannot use the same field
for both the row and the column groupings.
Joined reports can have up to three grouping levels.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 317 ]
Summary fields
A summary field is the SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, or MAX for a number or a currency field.
Summary fields are displayed at all grouping levels, including the grand total level for 
reports that have been created using the summary and matrix report formats.
To add a summary field, click on a column drop-down menu section (shown in the
following screenshot) for a field in the report and choose Summarize this Field. You can
also use this method to add a grouping by choosing Group by this Field, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Clicking on the Summarize this Field button gives you the following options:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 318 ]
This will produce a report result, as shown in the following screenshot:
Conditional highlighting
Conditional highlighting is a very powerful way to show, at a glance, whether the values
in reports are within acceptable limits. By setting up Conditional highlighting, you can
specify different colors for different ranges of values in your reports. It is relatively easy to
set up and it offers great visual benefits, and yet it is a feature that seems to be underused
by users within Salesforce CRM.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 319 ]
To enable Conditional highlighting, your report must contain at least one summary field
or custom summary formula, which at the time of writing is available for Summary or
Matrix reports.
To set up Conditional highlighting, click on Show and then on Conditional Highlighting,
as shown from within the Preview pane on the report builder page:
You then have the option to set colors according to whether the value falls below a low
breakpoint threshold, above a high breakpoint threshold, or a value that sits between the
range of values. The following screenshot shows an example of how the thresholds might
be set:

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards

The following table aims to show given settings and the table helps clarify the thresholds
and mentions the colors that would are be seen, given the settings above.

[ 321 ]
Custom summary formulas
Custom summary formulas allow you to calculate values based on the numeric fields
available in the report type. This means you do not have to create custom formula fields for
calculated results if they are only relevant in reports.
Formulas must be 3,900 characters or fewer. Up to five formulas can be created per report.
Fields available for custom summary formulas are Number, Percent, and Currency. To add
a new formula to a summary or matrix report, navigate to the Fields pane, where at the top,
you will see the formulas folder icon. By double-clicking on the Add Formula option, you
can define it and then click on OK. After you have defined a new formula on the report, it
automatically gets added to the preview pane as a column for summary reports and as a
summary field for matrix reports. The following screenshot shows the formula called
Opportunity Average Expected Revenue in the top-left section of the Fields pane and how
it automatically appears in the preview pane as a column (on the far right) for the example
summary report:
To define a formula field, follow these steps:
Click on Add Formula in the Fields pane:
1.

9.
choose the function you want to use in your formula, and click on Insert.
Click on Check Syntax to check that the formula contains no errors, and then
10.
click on OK.
Hiding details when building new reports:
Often when building new reports, you will not necessarily know just how
many records are actually going to be returned. This can be the reason for
the report in the first place. You may also be experimenting with the
report format to see which data is being returned. In these cases, you
should set the Hide Details option to prevent the detailed data being
returned and show just the skeleton of the report this shows the number of
rows that will be returned. Limiting rows on a Tabular report allows you
to use it as a source report for dashboard table and chart Components.
However, if you change the report format, the Row Limit setting is
automatically removed.
Bucket fields
Bucket fields allow you to categorize values based on fields available in the report type.
This means you do not have to create custom formula fields for categories or segmentation
of values if they are only relevant in reports. For example, sales managers can bucket or
group opportunities by size based on amount, support managers can age cases based on
days opened, and sales reps can group accounts into strategic accounts.
Fields available as Bucket fields are Number, Percent, Currency, Picklist,
and text fields.

Changing the Report format
Sometimes it is necessary to change the report format for the existing reports. The effects of
changing the report format are as follows:
Report format change
Effects of the change
Change from Tabular to either
Summary or Matrix
The Rows to Display filter is not applicable for Summary or
Matrix reports, and is therefore removed.
Change from Summary,
Matrix, or Joined to Tabular
reports
Groupings are not applicable for Tabular reports and are
removed from the report. The fields used for grouping are
removed and not converted to columns in the Tabular report.
Change from Summary report
to Matrix report
The Summary first grouping is used as the first Matrix row
grouping.
The second Summary grouping is used as the first column
grouping.
The third Summary grouping is used as the second row
grouping.
Note: When using the report wizard, the third Summary
grouping is automatically removed.
Change from Matrix report to
Summary report
The Matrix first row grouping becomes the first Summary
grouping.
The second row grouping becomes the third Summary
grouping.
The first column grouping becomes the second Summary
grouping.
The Matrix second column grouping is removed.
Note: When using the report wizard, both the second row
grouping and second column grouping are removed.
Change from Tabular,
Summary, or Matrix to Joined
The Matrix first row grouping becomes the first Summary
grouping. The second row grouping becomes the third
Summary grouping.
The first column grouping becomes the second summary
grouping.
The Matrix second column grouping is removed.
Note: When using the report wizard, both the second row
grouping and second column grouping are removed.

Dashboards
Dashboards are visual information snapshots that are generated from the data in associated
reports and are presented as graphical elements. These graphical elements are known as
dashboard Components, which can be categorized into five types.
Chart
Chart component types may be used to show data graphically, where the following variety
of chart types can be selected: horizontal and vertical bar charts, line charts, pie charts,
donut charts, funnel charts, and scatter charts.
Gauge
Gauge component types may be used to show a single value that is to be shown as a part of
a range of custom set values. Here, the ranges that can be set can represent, say, low,
medium, and high values, and the value from the report is plotted accordingly.
Metric
Metric component types may be used to show a single value to display.
Table
Table component types may be used to show a set of report data in column form.
Visualforce page
In addition to the standard types, Visualforce page component types may be used to create
a custom component type and present information in a way not available in the standard
dashboard component types.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 326 ]
Dashboards can have up to 20 Components, and you can control users access to dashboards
by storing them in folders with appropriate permissions, where folders can be public,
hidden, or restricted to groups or roles.
Dashboards can be further configured to run with the concept of a running user, which
means that the named users security settings determine which data to display. Here, all
dashboard viewers see data according to the security settings of that user who has been set
as the running user, irrespective of the dashboard viewers own personal security settings.
A more flexible and dynamic approach, however, allows you to set the running user to be
the logged-in user, so that each user is presented with the dashboard according to their own
data access level. This is known as dynamic dashboards.
Dashboard component types
In Salesforce CRM, the following dashboard component types are available:
Horizontal Bar Chart
Vertical Bar Chart
Line Chart
Pie Chart
Donut Chart
Funnel Chart
Scatter Chart
Gauge
Metric

Creating dashboards
Before creating dashboards, you need to have pre-prepared source reports containing the
data you wish to display.
These source reports must be stored in folders that your intended
dashboard viewers have access to or they will not be able to view the
information.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 328 ]
To create a dashboard, click on the Reports tab. This then presents the common reports and
dashboards main page with the heading Reports & Dashboards. On this page, click on the
New Dashboard button, as shown in the following screenshot:
Dynamic dashboards
A dynamic dashboard runs using the security settings of the user viewing the dashboard.
Each user sees the dashboard according to his or her own access level. This approach helps
you to share one common set of dashboard Components to users with different levels of
access. A single dynamic dashboard can display a standard set of metrics across all levels of
your organization.
Salesforce CRM limits at the time of writing permit organizations to have
up to five dynamic dashboards for Enterprise Edition and up to ten for
Unlimited Edition.

[ 332 ]
Dashboards must have at least two columns.
To set the width for the column, you can select either Narrow, Medium, or Wide
in the column-width drop-down list, as shown in the following screenshot:
If the component is a pie or donut chart with Show Values or Show
Percentages enabled and Legend Position set to Right, the dashboard
column width must be Wide for the values and percentages to be shown
on the dashboard.

Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards
[ 333 ]
Component – level controls
You can add Components by dragging a component type onto a column and then dropping
a data source (which is a source report) or a Visualforce page onto it.
You can also drop the data source first and then drop a component type onto it. To change
the type or source after you have created it, you can drop a different one onto the
component. Each component must have a type and a data source.
Each folder can display up to 200 data sources. However, if there are more
than 200, you can use the Quick Find option or set filters to reduce the
displayed list.
The following screenshot shows the drag-and-drop feature using a report from the Data
Sources tab:

b) Dynamic dashboards show blank graphs if the viewing user is a non-active user.
c) Dynamic dashboards run using the security settings of the user viewing the dashboard.
d) Dynamic dashboards refresh automatically when the underlying data changes.
Answers
Here are the answers to the five questions about report formats, report groupings,
Conditional highlighting, dashboard components, and dynamic dashboards.
Answer 1 – Report formats
The answer is d) Reports generated using the Tabular Report Format are the easiest and
quickest way to report data and are most suited for creating lists of records.
Answer 2 – Groupings
The answer is c) Summary. Although b) Joined and d) Matrix can also be used to create
grouped reports, the most suitable (and simplest) report type is Summary. Option a)
Tabular does not allow the grouping of report data fields.
Answer 3 – Conditional Highlighting
The answer is b) Summary, and c) Matrix. Conditional Highlighting is used in reports that
contain at least one summary field, so Tabular reports cannot be used. Although Joined
reports can have grouping, they cannot have Conditional Highlighting.

[ 340 ]
Answer 4 – Dashboard Components
The answer is c). The maximum number of Components that can be made available on a
dashboard is 20.
Answer 5 – Dynamic dashboards
The answer is c) Dynamic dashboards run using the security settings of the user viewing
the dashboard.
Summary
In this chapter, we looked at data analytics, where it was shown how data can be reported
and presented within Salesforce CRM. We looked at setting up reports and dashboards, and
how to use the report builder.
We covered the use of the building reports from standard and custom report types and
looked at the mechanisms for sharing, hiding, and mass deleting reports.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce
reports and dashboards.
In the coming chapter, we will look at the methods for automating business tasks and
activities to align them with business rules. The mechanisms that are available to help
manage business processes will also be covered in detail, where we will look at the way
approvals can be configured.

Implementing Business
Processes in Salesforce CRM
In the previous chapter, we looked at data analytics, where we covered reports and
dashboards.
In this chapter, we will cover in detail how you can automate and streamline the key
business processes for your organization with the use of the workflow rules and approval
process features within the Salesforce CRM application.
This chapter will focus on how you can configure actions for workflow rules and approval
processes to automate, improve quality, and generate high-value processes within your
organization.
Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of
Salesforce CRM administration in the area of Workflow Automation covered in this
chapter.
The following topics will be covered:
Workflow rules
Approval process
Workflow actions
Workflow queue
Approval wizard
Approvals in Chatter

Workflow rules and approval processes
The workflow rules and approval process features within the Salesforce CRM application
allow you to automate and streamline key business processes for your organization.
Workflow rules can be used to capture key business processes and events to generate
automated actions. They allow you to configure various types of actions to fire based on the
field or fields of the record, meeting predefined conditions. In essence, a workflow rule sets
workflow actions into motion when its predefined conditions are met. You can configure
workflow actions to execute immediately whenever a record meets the conditions specified
in the workflow rule, or you can set time-dependent features that execute the workflow
actions on a specific day.
Approval processes are a structured set of steps used to facilitate formal sign-off on data
records. They can range from simple, single steps to complex, sophisticated routing to
provide automated processing that your organization can use to approve records in
Salesforce CRM. Along with the steps that must be taken, the approval process also
specifies who must approve these steps. Approval steps can either be specified for all
records included in the process or restricted to records that have certain attributes.
Approval processes also specify the actions that are to be taken when a record is first
submitted, approved, rejected, or recalled.
Workflow rules and approval processes provide benefits such as improving the quality and
consistency of data, increasing data integrity, improving efficiency and productivity,
lowering costs, and reducing risks.
Workflow rules and approval processes allow you to automate the following types of
actions: e-mail alerts, tasks, field updates, and outbound messages.
E-mail alerts can be sent to one or more recipients. For example, e-mail alert actions can be
used to automatically send an account owner an e-mail whenever updates are made to one
of their accounts by another user.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 343 ]
Tasks can be assigned to users or record owners. For example, task actions can be used to
automatically assign follow-up tasks to a marketing executive whenever a new lead is
entered in the system.
Field updates can be used to modify the value of a field on a record. For example, a field
update action can be used to automatically update an opportunity field called Next Step
when it reaches a certain sales stage.
Outbound messages can be used to send a secure configurable API message (in XML
format) to a designated listener. For example, outbound messages can be used to
automatically invoke a new account creation process. This could be, say, whenever a new
account is entered in the Salesforce CRM application by triggering an outbound API
message to an external financial system.
Workflow rules in Salesforce CRM can be combined to help manage an entire process. For
example, when a lead is entered through your website using the Web to lead (covered
later), workflow rules can be used to automatically send a responding e-mail to the lead
contact and also to someone within your organization. Here, a workflow rule can be set to
create a task for one of your salespersons to telephone the lead contact along with a
reminder e-mail alert, to be sent a specified number of days after the lead record has been
entered.
If the salesperson changes the lead status, then a date field could be updated automatically
with the date that the lead was contacted.
Up until now, we have looked at the similarity of workflow rules and approval processes.
However, there are some key differences. Workflow rules consist of a single step and a
single result, whereas approval processes consist of multiple steps and different results
depending upon whether the record is approved or rejected. Workflow rules trigger
automatically and the rules, when triggered, are not visible to the user. Approval processes,
on the other hand, contain multiple steps, each requiring a specific I approve or reject user
action by the specified approver(s).
In practice, the first step in creating workflow rules and approval processes is to define and
map out the process and, for each step in the process, detail the objects, the criteria, the
users, and the actions required.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 344 ]
Workflow and approval actions
Workflow and approval actions consist of e-mail alerts, tasks, field updates, and outbound
messages that can be triggered either by a workflow rule or by an approval process:
Email alert: An e-mail alert is an action that can be generated by both workflow
and approval actions using an e-mail template that is sent to specified recipients,
who can be either Salesforce CRM application users or external e-mail recipients.
Field update: A field update is an action that can be activated by use of both 
workflow and approval actions, and which specifies the field for update and the
new value for it. The field's update action depends on the data type of the field,
where you can choose to apply a specific value, clear the field, or calculate a
value according to a criterion or a derived formula you can specify.
Task: Tasks are workflow and approval actions that are triggered by workflow
rules or approval processes, and they allow the assignment of tasks to a user who
you can specify. You would also specify the Subject, Status, Priority, and Due
Date of the task. Tasks appear on the user's calendar, and can be accessed by the
My Tasks section of the Home tab or on the specific day for the task within the
Day View section on the user's calendar. Tasks can be assigned on their own, but
you can also combine them with an e-mail alert to inform the user.
Outbound message: An outbound message in Salesforce CRM is an action that
can be activated by both workflows and approvals, and which sends information
to a web URL endpoint, all of which can specify. The outbound message contains
the data in specified fields, in what is known as a SOAP message to the endpoint.
As this requires development of a receiving web-service, this action is not
covered in this book.
Configuring e-mail alerts for workflow rules and
approval processes
To configure e-mail alerts, follow the pathSetup | Create | Workflow| Email Alerts, and
then click on the New Email Alert button.
Within the Email Alert Edit page, the following settings are presented:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 345 ]
To set the details for the e-mail alert, carry out the following steps:
Enter a description for the e-mail alert.
1.
Enter a unique name for the e-mail alert.
2.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 346 ]
The unique name for the e-mail alert is required and used by the API and
managed packages. The name is auto-populated when you enter the
preceding field, called Description. There are restrictions for permitted
characters whereby the unique name must begin with a letter and use only
alphanumeric characters and underscores. Also, the unique name cannot
end with an underscore nor have two consecutive underscores.
Choose an e-mail template.
3.
The Protected Component checkbox is used to mark the alert as protected.
This option can be ignored as it is a setting used by developers who are
building applications with the managed release package functionality. If
you install a managed package, there are restrictions on what can be
edited by non-developers. Managed Packages in Salesforce  are discussed
in Chapter 9, Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM.
Now select who should receive this e-mail alert from the available options:
4.
Recipients
Description
Account Owner
If the Account Owner is selected, then the e-mail alert is sent to the
user in Salesforce CRM who is set as the account owner of either the
account record or the account that is related to the record. Since this
option requires an account relationship to be present, it is only valid
on accounts, opportunities, contacts, and custom objects that are
children of the account object.
Account Team
Choose from the list of users that are assigned to a particular accounts
team role. Note that e-mail alerts are only sent when the rule is
associated with the account object or any of its direct child objects.
Case Team
Choose from the list of users assigned to a particular case team role.
Creator
This is the user listed as the record creator, and is the user who is set in
the Created By field.
Customer Portal User
Choose from the list of users that are associated with a Customer
Portal.
Email Field
An e-mail address field on the selected object, such as the Email Field
on contact records or a custom e-mail field.
Owner
The record owner.
Partner User
Choose from the list of users that are associated with a partner portal.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 347 ]
Portal Role
Choose from the list of users that are assigned to a particular portal
role.
Portal Role and
Subordinates
Choose from the list of users assigned to a particular portal role, plus
all users in roles below that role.
Public Groups
Choose from the list of users in a particular public group.
Related Contact
An associated contact on the record. For example, you may have
created a custom contact on the opportunity object called Key
Decision Maker.
Related Lead or
Contact Owner
This is a related user lookup to the owner fields set on either the lead
or contact record that is associated to the record. As an example, for
opportunities, this field could be set to a contact role field linking to a
contact.
Related User
A Related User is a user lookup field that is associated to the record.
As an example, this field may be set to the Last Modified By field.
Role
Choose from the list of users assigned a particular role.
Role and Internal
Subordinates
Choose from the list of users in a particular role, plus all users in roles
below that role, excluding partner portal and customer portal users.
Role and
Subordinates
Choose from the list of users in a particular role, plus all users in roles
below that role.
User
Choose from the list of available users in Salesforce CRM.
Opportunity Team
Once you have set up sales opportunity teams, this option allows you
to choose from the list of users associated to an opportunity team.
Select the recipients who should receive this e-mail alert in the Available Recipients list
and click on Add.
If you change the object after selecting the recipients, the Selected
Recipients list will be automatically cleared.
Optionally, enter to and from e-mail addresses, and then click on Save.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 348 ]
Here, you can do the following:
Enter up to five additional recipient e-mail addresses (which may or may not be
users in Salesforce)
Set the From Email Address to either the current user's e-mail address or to the
default workflow user's e-mail address
Finally, to begin using the e-mail alert, associate it with either a workflow rule or
an approval process
Set the From Email Address:
Setting the From Email Address also allows you to use a standard global
e-mail address for your organization, such as
Customer_Services@WidgetXYZ.com, instead of the default From field,
which is the e-mail address of the user who updates the record. Only
verified, organization-wide e-mail addresses will appear in the From
Email Address picklist options.
There is a daily limit of 1,000 e-mail alerts per standard Salesforce license for workflows and
approvals.
There is also an overall daily limit of 2 million e-mail alerts for your entire organization and
when the daily limits are reached, a warning e-mail is sent out by the Salesforce CRM
application to the default workflow user where one is set. If there is no default workflow
user set, then the warning e-mail goes out to a system administrator.
Organization-wide e-mail addresses
By setting up organization-wide e-mail addresses, your users can share a set of common e-
mail aliases. Here, you can define a list of organization-wide e-mail addresses for each user
profile.
When sending e-mails from Salesforce, users with these profiles can then choose a different
From address than the e-mail address that they have defined on their user record, and any
e-mail responses are then returned to the organization-wide address.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 349 ]
To set up the list of organization-wide e-mail addresses, follow the path Setup | Email
Administration | Organization-Wide Addresses.
From Organization-Wide Addresses, you can set the display name, the e-mail address, and
the profiles that are permitted to use that address, as shown in the following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 350 ]
When the organization-wide e-mail address is saved or changed, Salesforce will send an e-
mail to the address specified in the e-mail address field to verify that the e-mail address is
valid, as shown in the following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 351 ]
Now, the verified organization-wide e-mail addresses will appear in the From Email
Address picklist options when configuring e-mail alerts, as shown in the following
screenshot:
Configuring tasks for workflow rules and
approval processes
To configure tasks, follow the path Setup | Create | Workflow | Tasks, and then click on
the New Task button.
From the Step 1: Select Object page, select the object type for the record from the Select
Object picklist and click on Next.
When creating tasks for custom objects, only custom objects that have
been set with activities are available for selection in the picklist.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 352 ]
Within the Step 2: Configure Task page, the following settings are presented:
To set the details for the task, carry out the following steps:
You must select an individual or individuals for whom you want to can set the
1.
required Assigned To field. Here, the options when you click on the lookup
dialog for the.  Assigned To setting allow for the selection of either User, Role, or
Record Owner.
If the assignee of a workflow task is a role, and that particular role has
multiple users, the record owner is then assigned the task. This is done
regardless of the type of role that the record owner has, which can cause
some confusion. This is because tasks cannot be assigned to more than one
user, and hence best practice dictates that you do not assign tasks to roles,
even though the option exists.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 353 ]
Enter a subject and a unique name for the task.
2.
The unique name for the task is required and used by the API and any
managed packages. The name is auto-populated when you move from the
preceding field, called Subject. There are restrictions for permitted
characters, whereby the unique name must begin with a letter and use
only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Also, the unique name
cannot end with an underscore nor have two consecutive underscores.
Choose a due date, status, and priority, where due dates appear in the time zone
3.
of the assignee.
Set the Notify Assignee checkbox to also send an e-mail notification when the 
4.
task is assigned.
The Protected Component checkbox is used to mark the alert as protected.
This is used by developers who are building managed package
applications for the AppExchange marketplace (AppExchange is covered
in Chapter 9, Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM).
Finally, to set the task into action, associate it with the required workflow rule or
5.
approval process.
Optionally, enter any comments for the description information that is included
6.
with the task and then click on Save.
When the task is assigned, it will include a Created By field that contains
the name of the person who saved the record that triggered the rule to
assign the task.
Configuring field updates for workflow rules and
approval processes
To configure field updates, follow the path Setup | Create | Workflow | Field Updates,
and then click on the New Field Update button.
Within the Field Update Edit page, perform the following:
Enter a name and a unique name for the field update.
1.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 354 ]
Both the name and a unique name for the field update are required. The
unique name is used by the API and managed packages. The name is
auto-populated when you exit the preceding Name field. There are
restrictions for permitted characters in that the unique name must begin
with a letter and use only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Also,
the unique name cannot end with an underscore or have two consecutive
underscores.
Now, optionally, enter a description for the field to update and then choose the
2.
object type to present the field to be updated, as shown here for the Opportunity
object:
 

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 355 ]
Upon choosing the object and field to update, a new section called Specify New Field
Value appears where you can set the logic of the desired field update. Here, the available 
options depend on the type of field you are updating, with the following options.
Checkboxes
For checkboxes, choose True to select the checkbox and False to deselect it, as shown in the
following screenshot:
This is useful for automating the setting of status flags for records whenever a certain
business process is completed. In the previous example, the field update of the field Publish
to Web? allows the automatic setting of the checkbox option to True, say, so that the record
can be published.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 356 ]
Record owners
For record owners, choose the user to whom the record should be assigned, as shown in the
following screenshot:
This is useful for automating the changing of the record owner for records whenever a
certain business process is complete. For example, you could automate the field update of
the record owner from, say, a marketing executive to an account manager, if a lead matches
certain criteria. When selecting the user for the record owner field update, you must use the
user lookup icon and select a specific active user. You cannot, therefore, automatically
derive the new owner from any given criteria.
Selecting Notify Assignee allows the automatic sending of an e-mail to the
new record owner whenever the field update fires.
Picklists
For picklist fields, you can either select a specific value from the picklist or you can select
the value above or below the current value as shown in the following screenshot. The
options The value above the current one and The value below the current one selection is
based on the sorting order that is set in the Picklist field definition:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 357 ]
Other data types
For all other data types, you can set the following Text Options as shown here:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 358 ]
Follow these steps to finish the field update configuration:
Choose A blank value (null) if you want to remove any existing value and leave
1.
the field blank.
This option is not available for required fields, checkboxes, and some other
types of fields.
Choose Use a formula to set the new value to calculate the value based on the
2.
formula logic.
Now click on Save to complete the configuration of the field update.
3.
Finally, to set the field update into action, associate it with the required workflow
4.
rule or approval process.
Configuring outbound message notifications for
workflow rules and approval processes
An outbound message in Salesforce CRM is an action – that can be activated by both 
workflows and approvals – that sends information to a web-URL endpoint you specify.
The outbound message contains the data using the specified fields in what is known as a
SOAP message to the endpoint URL. Once the endpoint receives the message data, it
consumes the information from the message and processes it.
The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is an industry-standard
protocol that defines a uniform way of passing data encoded in the XML
format. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is an industry-standard
markup language that enables the sharing and transportation of
structured data.
As this requires the development of a receiving web-service endpoint, setting up this action
is beyond the scope of this book.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 359 ]
Configuring workflow rules
You can configure your organization's workflow by creating workflow rules. Each
workflow rule consists of the following:
Criteria that cause the Salesforce CRM application to trigger the workflow rule
Actions that execute immediately when a record matches the criteria
Time-dependent actions that the Salesforce CRM application processes when a
record matches the criteria, and executes according to the specified time triggers
The following table is an overview of the key aspects of configuring workflow rules in
Salesforce CRM:

Create workflow actions ahead of workflow rules. Create actions and any
associated e-mail templates before starting to configure workflow rules.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 360 ]
The following outlines the steps required to create a workflow rule:
Create the workflow rule and select the object.
1.
Configure the settings and criteria for the workflow rule.
2.
Specify the workflow actions.
3.
Activate the workflow rule.
4.
To create a workflow rule, follow the path Setup | Create | Workflow & Approvals |
Workflow Rules.
The Workflow Rules detail page shows a list of the current workflow rules, along with
various properties such as the associated object and whether the rule is active. On this page,
you can create views to help filter and manage the list of rules as the numbers increase. The
following screen shows the list of all the workflow rules in our organization using the All
Workflow Rules view:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 361 ]
From the Workflow Rules list page, you can click on the New Rule button and then select
an object (either a custom or standard object) on which you want to apply your new 
workflow rule. In the Step 1: Select object screen shown as follows, the standard object,
Opportunity, has been selected:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 362 ]
Now, click on Next to navigate and display the Step 2: Configure Workflow Rule page to
allow the rule settings and criteria to be specified, as shown in the following screenshot:
Configuring rule settings and criteria
In the Edit Rule section, you must enter a rule name and, optionally, you may enter a
description for the rule.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 363 ]
Evaluation Criteria
In the Evaluation Criteria section, you choose the appropriate criteria that causes the
Salesforce CRM application to trigger the workflow rule.
The criteria can be selected from the following three options:
created: Choose this option to ignore any subsequent updates to existing records,
as the rule will only ever run once: when the record is inserted.
created, and every time it's edited: Choose this option to include new record
inserts and updates to existing records. These actions cause repeated triggering of
the rule as long as the record meets the criteria.
You cannot add time-dependent actions to a rule if you choose the created,
and every time it's edited option.
created, and any time it's edited to subsequently meet criteria: Choose this
option to include new records and updates to existing records.
The rule is not re-triggered on record updates that do not affect the
specified rule criteria.
For example, if the updating of an opportunity record's probability to 90 percent causes the
rule to run, with this option, the rule will only get triggered again if the probability changes
and then changes back to 90 percent, regardless of how many times the record is itself
updated.
Rule Criteria
In the Rule Criteria section, there are two ways of formulating the logic used to trigger the
workflow rule. They are as follows:
Run this rule if the following criteria are met
Run this rule if the following formula evaluates to true

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 364 ]
Run this rule if the following criteria are met
This option is displayed by default and allows you to select the filter criteria a record must
meet to trigger the rule.
As an example, the filter has been set to one of the following:
Opportunity: Close Date equals NEXT 7 DAYS AND
Opportunity: Closed not equal to True
These criteria would allow us to construct a workflow rule to notify a salesperson that they
have an open opportunity with a close date that will be reached within a week:
Clicking on the Add Filter Logic link presents additional options for adding rows and
advanced filter conditions, as shown in the following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 365 ]
The Add Row link allows you to add more criteria options, where up to a maximum of 25
can be added.
The Filter Logic section allows you to use Boolean expressions to set the criteria. These
expressions are known as Advanced Filters.
For example, (1 AND 2) results in an expression that requires both of the first two filter
lines to be valid.
Run this rule if the following formula evaluates to true option
This option allows you to enter a formula that returns a value of True or False. The
Salesforce CRM application triggers the rule if the formula returns True.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 366 ]
Workflow formulas can be used to capture complicated logic, as in the following use-case
example.
Whenever an opportunity is set as lost, where the sales stage was previously
Negotiation/Review and the amount is greater than $50,000, send an e-mail or task to be
sent to Sales Management for follow-up:
Some functions are not available in workflow rule formulas; you cannot
create a formula in which a custom object references fields on a parent
object.
In addition to the functions shown on the right-hand side of the Rule Criteria section, you
can also use merge fields for directly related objects in workflow-rule formulas. The
formula evaluates to true rule can be useful wherever it is needed to trigger some actions, if
the value of a particular field is being changed. As for all formula-merge fields that allow
you to reference fields on related objects across multiple relationships, the field name is
prefixed by the name of the relationship. For standard relationships, the name of the
relationship is the master object. For example, you can reference the account name merge
field from an opportunity using Account.Name.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 367 ]
Click on the Check Syntax button to validate that the formula contains no error before
progressing beyond this page.
Now click on Save & Next to proceed to the Step 3: Specify Workflow Actions page, which
allows you to configure the workflow actions.
Specifying the workflow actions
The Specify Workflow Actions page allows you to add both immediate and time-
dependent actions to the workflow rule, as shown in the following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 368 ]
Immediate workflow actions
Immediate actions trigger as soon as the evaluation criteria are met. As shown in the
preceding example, the Salesforce CRM application can immediately send an e-mail to the
salesperson if an opportunity is created or edited and is still open seven days before the
specified close date.
Time-dependent workflow actions
Time-dependent actions specify when Salesforce CRM is to execute the workflow action. As
shown in the preceding example, the Salesforce CRM application can automatically send an
e-mail reminder to the salesperson three days later if an opportunity is created or edited
and is still open seven days before the specified close date.
Time-dependent actions and time triggers are complex features with
several considerations Workflow rules that have time-dependent actions
should be specified with a default workflow user to ensure they fire for
future actions. This is in case the user who activated the workflow later
leaves the organization and is set as an inactive user.
Adding immediate workflow actions
To add an immediate workflow action, click on theAdd Workflow Action drop-down
selection in the Immediate Workflow Actions section and choose either New Task, New
Email Alert, New Field Update, New Outbound Message, or Select Existing Action to
select an existing action to associate with the rule:
New Task to create a task to associate with the rule
New Email to create an e-mail alert to associate with the rule
New Field Update to define a field update to associate with the rule
New Outbound Message to define an outbound message to associate with the
rule
Existing Action to select an existing action to associate with the rule

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 369 ]
Adding time-dependent workflow actions
To add a time-dependent workflow action, click on Add Time Trigger in the Time-
Dependent Workflow Actions section. Then, specify the number of days or hours before or
after a date relevant to the record, such as the date the record was created or modified, or
even for an opportunity close date, as shown in the following screenshot:
The Add Time Trigger button is not displayed and the option to create a time trigger is
unavailable under the following workflow rule scenarios:
The workflow rule criteria has been configured to fire using the option, created,
and any time it’s edited to subsequently meet criteria
The workflow rule is already active (here, you must temporarily deactivate it in
order to apply the action)
The workflow rule is not active, but there are pending actions which are yet to be
processed in the workflow queue
Additional, immediate, or time-dependent actions can now be configured. Finally, click on
the Done button in the top-right corner of the screen.
Activating the workflow rule
The Salesforce CRM application will not trigger a workflow rule until you have manually
activated it.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 370 ]
To activate a workflow rule, click on Activate on the workflow rule detail page. Click on
Deactivate to stop a rule from triggering (or if you want to edit the time-dependent actions
and time triggers associated with the rule):
Workflow rule considerations
Consider the following when configuring workflow rules:
You can deactivate a workflow rule at any time. However, if you deactivate a rule
that has pending actions, Salesforce.com completes those actions as long as the
record that triggered the rule is not updated.
You cannot add time-dependent workflow actions to active workflow rules. You
must deactivate the workflow rule first, add the time-dependent workflow
action, and then re-activate the rule.
Workflow rules on custom objects are automatically deleted if the custom object
is deleted.
You cannot create e-mail alerts for workflow rules on activity records.
Creating new records or updating existing records can trigger more than one
rule.
Time-dependent field updates can retrigger the re-evaluation of workflow rules.
The order in which actions are executed is not guaranteed. Field update actions
are executed first, followed by other actions.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 371 ]
For custom, and some standard, objects, you can create workflow actions
where a change to a detail record updates a field on the related master
record.
For example, in a custom publishing application, you may create a workflow rule that sets
the status of a book (the master object) to In Process – Author when a chapter (the detail
object) is being reviewed by the editor.
Cross-object field updates work for custom-to-custom master-detail relationships, custom-
to-standard master-detail relationships, and a few standard-to-standard master-detail
relationships. They are displayed in the following way:
If you require cross-object actions for standard objects such as updating a
field on each Opportunity Product record when a certain field on the
Opportunity changes, or further complex updating such as automatic
record creation or deletion actions, you would need to use Process
Builder, Visual Workflow or develop Apex triggers instead of workflow
rules.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 372 ]
Monitoring the workflow queue
You can use the time-based workflow queue to monitor any outstanding workflow rule that
has time-dependent actions. Here you can view pending actions and cancel them if
necessary.
To access the Time-Based Workflow queue, follow the path Setup | Monitoring | Time-
Based Workflow, where the following page is presented:
Click on Search to view all the pending actions for any active time-based workflow rules, or
set the filter criteria and click on Search to view only the pending actions that match the
criteria. Set the checkbox for any listed workflow rule(s) you wish to cancel and then click
on Delete to terminate the selected queued workflow rule(s).
In summary, workflow rules allow one or more actions to fire based on fields on the record
(or its parent) meeting certain conditions. Workflow rules are a little more complex than
validation rules, and take a bit more familiarity with Salesforce.com to properly execute.
However, they can offer powerful business automation and can be implemented without
any custom code or the work of a developer.

Approval process
An approval process in Salesforce CRM is an automated mechanism that you can set up to
process the approval of records within your organization.
Working with approval processes involves the creation of a structured set of steps to enable
the sign-off of specified records that must be approved, along with specifying which users
must be set to approve it at each of the steps. Here, each step can apply to all the records
within the process or specified records that have certain field values. The building of
approval processes also requires the setting of the required actions to be taken after the
record is either first submitted, approved, rejected, or recalled for approval.
Approval processes are similar to workflow rules in the sense that they can invoke the same
key actions; however, there are significant differences between workflow rules and
approval processes, such as:
Workflow rules are activated when a record is saved, whereas approval processes
are manually triggered by explicitly clicking on the Submit for Approval button.
Workflow rules consist of a single step and a single action. Approval processes
consist of multiple steps, where a different action is taken based upon whether
the record is approved or rejected.
Workflows can be modified or deleted. In approvals, some attributes cannot be
modified, and approval processes must be deactivated before outstanding
approvals can be deleted.
Approval processes result in the approval history being automatically tracked,
which is not applied to workflow rules.
When an approval is initiated, the record is locked down and cannot be changed
by someone, other than the approver or system administrator, until the record
has completed the approval process.
Approval processes require a good understanding of your business rules and processes in
order to be successfully implemented.
They must, therefore, be implemented correctly, so that records are locked down only when
necessary to avoid hindering Salesforce users that are attempting to update records.
Approval processes can, however, be a powerful mechanism to control an internal process
that must be completed as part of a business process.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 374 ]
Example uses for approval processes are obtaining management sign-off before quotes or
contracts are sent to customers or prospects for certain deals, or getting authorization before
users are set up in the Salesforce CRM application itself. In this example, the user activation
request could be approved by the sales management team and individuals from other
departments, such as finance, before the user license is obtained and the user record
created.
In the same way as workflow actions, approval actions consist of e-mail alerts, tasks, field
updates, and outbound messages that can be triggered by the approval process.
The following outlines the work items required to configure approval processes:
Providing the name of the process
Specifying the entry criteria for the records
Specifying who is going to approve
Specifying the e-mail template
Determining the fields to be displayed on the approver page
Specifying who is going to send the approval mail
Approval process checklist
It is useful to plan Salesforce CRM approval processes carefully to help ensure a successful
and smooth implementation. The following checklist specifies the required information and
prerequisites needed before starting to configure your approval process:
Determine the steps and how many levels your process has. It is often useful to
map out the process using a charting tool such as Microsoft Visio.
Decide if users can approve requests by e-mail and set up this feature
accordingly.
Create an approval-request e-mail template.
Determine the approval-request sender.
Determine the assigned approver.
Determine the delegated approver, if necessary.
Decide if your approval process needs a filter.
Design initial submission actions.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 375 ]
Determine if users can edit records that are awaiting approval.
Decide if records should be auto-approved or rejected.
Determine the actions when an approval request is approved or rejected.
Salesforce recommends that you educate users about each approval
process and the entry criteria for the approval process. This is because
users have no visibility of which approval processes are fired when the
Submit for Approval button is pressed. Furthermore, Salesforce shows an
error if the user is not an allowed submitter for the approval process or the
record does not meet the entry criteria.
Approvals in Chatter
If your organization has both Approvals and Chatter enabled, you can activate Approvals
in Chatter, which enables users to receive approval requests in their Chatter feeds. To
enable Approvals in Chatter, navigate to Setup | Customize | Chatter | Chatter Settings.
Click the Edit button and check the Allow Approvals checkbox, as shown in the following
screenshot:
The approval request appears as a Chatter post, which you can customize by creating
unique post templates and associating them with the approval processes.
Approvals in Chatter checklist
To ensure that your users will see their approval requests as Chatter posts and everything
works correctly, it is recommended that you follow this checklist when you are ready to
activate Approvals in Chatter for your organization:
Create an approval process as described in the Configuring approval processes
section in this chapter.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 376 ]
Enable Chatter feed tracking for the object on which your approval process is
based (this is described in Chapter 8, Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and
Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM).
Create an approval post template for the object on which your approval process
is based. If you want to make this the default template for all approval processes
on this object, be sure to check the Default checkbox when configuring your post
template as described in the Configuring approval processes section in this chapter .
Activate the Enable Approvals in Chatter setting.
Activating the Enable Approvals in Chatter setting as the last step ensures
that all approval processes are properly configured to make use of it and,
once activated, all existing active approval processes will start generating
Chatter approval posts.
Configuring approval processes
To create an approval process, follow these steps:
Launch the approval process wizard.
1.
Specify Name, UniqueName, and Description.
2.
Specify Criteria for EnteringProcess.
3.
Specify Approver Field and Record Editability.
4.
Select Email Notification Template.
5.
Configure Approval Request Page Layout.
6.
Specify Initial Submitters.
7.
Activate the approval process.
8.
Choosing an approval process wizard
When you click on the Create New Approval Process button to start creating an approval
process, you are presented with the following two options in which to build the process:
Use Jump Start Wizard or Use Standard Setup Wizard. The following sections outline the
differences between these two mechanisms.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 377 ]
Jump Start Wizard
The Jump Start Wizard is provided as a quick way to create simple approval processes that
have a single step. To simplify the settings, with this option the Salesforce CRM application
automatically determines some default options for you.
Standard Setup Wizard
The Standard Setup Wizard enables the creation of complex approval processes, and is
used where multiple processing steps are required. This option provides the mechanisms to
define your process and then uses a setup wizard to define each step within that process.
To create an approval process, follow the path Setup | Create | Workflow & Approvals |
Approval Processes.
Choose the object for the new approval process, click on it, and then select Use Standard
Setup Wizard, as shown in the following screenshot, where we have selected Opportunity:
To set the details for the approval process, carry out the following:
In Step 1. Enter Name and Description page (where this is step 1 of 6): enter a Process
Name, a Unique Name, and optionally a Description, and then click on Next

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 378 ]
To specify the entry criteria, which is an optional step on the Step 2. Specify Entry Criteria
page and is used to determine the records that enter the approval process, you can either
choose from the formula logic, or you can select certain fields, operators, and values to
specify when the desired criteria are met. This is shown in the following screenshot, which
is presented as Step 2 of 6:
In Step 2: Specify Entry Criteria, either enter the filter criteria for records that are to be
included by this approval process, or leave all the filters blank to have all records submitted
within the approval process.
Restricting the approval process for specific users:
If only specific users are involved in this approval process, you can specify
it here. For example, if only the sales team is to submit opportunity
reviews, enter the following filter criteria: Current User: Department
Equals Sales. As shown in the preceding screenshot, in the fourth entry
criteria row where Field is Current User: Department, Operator is equals
and Value is Sales.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 379 ]
Click on Next to set the Specify Approver Field andRecord Editability options.
In this step (step 3 of 6), you would specify who the users are for the approval steps in
Salesforce CRM. Here, a user field can be used to automatically route approval requests.
This field can be the Manager field on an individual's user record, or you can create a
custom hierarchical (User to User) field on the User object.
In Step 3. Specify Approver Field and Record Editability Properties, using the Next
Automated Approver Determined By picklist, select a user field if you want the Salesforce
CRM application to automatically assign approval requests to an approver based on the
value in the user field. For example, you may want to automatically send approval requests
to a user's manager as specified in the user's Manager field, as shown in the following
screenshot:
To allow users to manually choose another user that will approve any approval requests,
leave the Next Automated Approver Determined By field blank:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 380 ]
By selecting the Use Approver Field of Record Owner checkbox, you can set the
approval process to use the standard Manager field or a custom field on the
record owner's user record instead of the submitting user's record.
If you set the Use Approver Field of Record Owner checkbox (applying
the manager of the record owner instead of the manager of the submitting
user), it is applied to all subsequent steps.
Select the appropriate Record Editability Properties and click on Next.
When a record is in the approval process, it is always locked, and only you
as system administrator can edit it. However, you can specify that the
currently assigned approver can also edit the record.
When an approval process assigns an approval request to a user, Salesforce.com
automatically sends the user an approval request e-mail. This e-mail contains a
web link that the user can click on to access the approval page within the
Salesforce CRM application, which lets the user approve or reject the request and
also enter comments.
By enabling e-mail approval response, the user can alternatively reply to
the e-mail by typing approve, approved, yes, reject, rejected, or no in the
first line of the e-mail body, and then add comments in the second line.
This option makes it easy to approve or reject approval requests, and is
especially useful for users who access approval requests using a mobile
device.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 381 ]
In Step 4. Select Notification Templates, you can choose a custom e-mail
template to be used when notifying an approver that an approval request has
been assigned to them, as shown in the following screenshot for the example
Approval Request template. Alternatively, by leaving this field blank, a simple
default e-mail template is used. In addition, if Approvals in Chatter has been
enabled, you can also choose an Approval Post Template, as shown in the
following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 382 ]
E-mail approval response
By enabling e-mail approval response, the user can alternatively reply to the e-mail by
typing approve, approved, yes, reject, rejected, or no in the first line of the e-mail body. To
enable Email Approval Response, navigate to Setup | Customize | Workflow &
Approvals | Process Settings. Now check the Enable Email Approval Response checkbox,
as shown in the following screenshot:
If the e-mail approval response is enabled and the user does not respond
correctly, perhaps by misspelling the word approve or typing it on the
wrong line, the Salesforce CRM application will not process the incorrect
response made by the user.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 383 ]
Within the Step 5. Select Fields to Display on Approval Page Layout page, the option to
configure the approval request page layout can be carried out as shown in the following
example:
The approval page is where an approver approves or rejects a request, and it is on Step 5.
Select Fields to Display on Approval Page Layout of configuring the approval process
where you can carry out the following:
Select and sort the fields you want to display on the approval request page.
1.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 384 ]
Select Display approval history information in addition to the field selected
2.
previously to include the Approval History-related list, which displays the Date,
Status, Assigned To, Actual Approver, Comments, and Overall Status columns
on the resulting approval request page, as shown in the following screenshot:
To specify how approvers can access an approval page, select either Allow
3.
approvers to access the approval page only from within the application.
(Recommended), Allow approvers to access the approval page from within the
salesforce.com application, or externally from a wireless-enabled mobile
device, and then click on Next (as shown previously in the step 5 screenshot).

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 385 ]
Now specify Initial Submitters, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.
Specify which users are allowed to submit records for approval.
5.
Optionally, select Add the Approval History related list to all Opportunity page
6.
layouts (as shown for the Opportunity object-related approval). This will
automatically update all the page layouts for this object and include a related list
that allows users to view and submit approval requests.
Optionally, select Allow submitters to recall approval requests to give submitters
7.
the option to withdraw their approval requests.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 386 ]
When the Allow submitters to recall approval requests option is selected, the Recall
Approval Request button in the Approval History-related list is visible for the users that
have submitted the record, as well as you, as system administrator.
When a user clicks on Recall Approval Request, the pending approval request for the
record is withdrawn and the recall action is run.
This option is required for scenarios where changes occur to the record while waiting for
approval sign-off. For example, an opportunity might be set to lost or the amount might be
lowered below the approval threshold after it has been submitted for approval, or the
current approver may be on vacation and the approval needs to be resubmitted and sent to
a different user for approval.
Ensure that the recall action resets the state of the record and any field
updates that occurred during the initial submission are rolled-back if
necessary. If the state of the record is not returned to how it was before the
initial submission any attempt to re-submit the approval may fail or the
approval may fail to function correctly.
Now click on Save, then Next, and finally, click on the Activate button next to the process.
You will be unable to activate the process until you have created at least
one approval step for the approval process.
Creating approval steps
Approval steps in Salesforce CRM set the flow of the record approval process that
associates the participating users at each chain of approval. For each approval step, we set
who can approve requests for the records, what the record must contain to meet the criteria,
and why the record should be allowed to be approved (in the case of a delegated approver).
In addition, the very first approval step in a process also specifies the action required
whenever the record fails to reach that step. Later steps then require you to set the action to
be taken whenever an approver rejects the request.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 387 ]
To create an approval step, follow the path Setup | Create | Workflow & Approvals |
Approval Processes and select the name of the approval process, and then carry out the
following:
Click on the New Approval Step button from the Approval Steps-related list
section
For both Enterprise and Unlimited Editions, there is a limit of 30 steps per
process.
Enter the Name, a Unique Name, and an optional Description for the approval
step
Enter a step number that positions the step in relation to any other step in the
approval process, as shown in the following screenshot, and click on Next:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 388 ]
On this page, you specify that either all records should enter this step or that only records
with certain attributes should enter this step, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you specified the filter criteria or entered a formula, you can choose what should happen
to records that do not meet the criteria or if the formula returns False, where the options
are as follows:
Approve record to automatically approve the request and perform all final
approval actions.
Reject record to automatically reject the request and perform all final rejection
actions. This option is only available for the first step in the approval process.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 389 ]
Now click on Next to display the page Step 3. Select Assigned Approver, where you
specify the user who should approve records that enter this step and, optionally, choose
whether the approver's delegate is also allowed to approve these requests, as shown in the
following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 390 ]
The options are as follows:
Let the submitter choose the approver manually, which prompts the user to
manually select the next approver
Automatically assign using the user field selected earlier, which assigns the
approval request to the user in the custom field that is displayed next to this
option (where this custom field was selected during the earlier configuration of
the approval process, which in the preceding screenshot is (Manager)
Automatically assign to approver(s), which allows you to assign the approval
request to one or more users or related users, as shown in the following
screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 391 ]
If you specify multiple approvers in the Automatically assign to approver(s) option, choose
one of the following options:
Approve or reject based on the FIRST response, whereby the first response to
the approval request determines whether the record is approved or rejected.
Require UNANIMOUS approval from all selected approvers, whereby the
record is only approved if all of the approvers approve the request. If any of the
approvers reject the request, then the approval request is rejected.
For custom objects and most standard objects, you can set a queue to be
included as part of the automatically assigned approver option. At the
time of writing, approval processes for Opportunities, Solutions, and
Quotes cannot be assigned to queues.
Also on this page, there is the option to specify that The approver's delegate may also
approve this request, where the delegate user is set in the Delegated Approver field on the
assigned approver's user page.
Delegated approvers cannot reassign approval requests, and they are only
permitted to approve or reject approval requests.
If this is not the first step in the approval process, you must specify what will happen if the
approver rejects a request in this step, as shown in the following example, where the
options are as follows:
Perform all rejection actions for this step and all final rejection actions (Final
Rejection).
Perform only the rejection actions for this step and send the approval request
back to the most recent approver (go back one step).
 
For both Enterprise and Unlimited Editions, each approval step can have
up to 25 approvers.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 392 ]
Now click on Save and specify any workflow action you want to set within this step using
the following options:
Yes, I'd like to create a new approval action for this step now
Yes, I'd like to create a new rejection action for this step now
No, I'll do this later. Take me to the approval process detail page to review what
I've just created.
Finally, click on Go! to complete the approval process.
Measuring and refining
Although you will need to plan for successful implementation of approval processes, it is
highly likely that they will need to change over time. This could be due to a change of
business processing, or refinement of the process within the Salesforce CRM application.
It is therefore a good idea to create analytics to help measure and verify that the approval
process is operating successfully. You could, for example, produce reports and dashboards
to measure how long approvals take through the process and identify any areas of the
process that are not working as expected and refine them accordingly. See Chapter 6,
Generating Data Analytics with Reports and Dashboards for details of how to produce reports
and dashboards.
Process visualizer
The process visualizer provides a read-only representation of your saved approval
processes. It can be accessed by clicking on the View Diagram button from within the saved
approval process, as shown in the following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 393 ]
The following screen is displayed for the simple two-step approval process for reviewing
opportunity deals that are greater than 100k:
With the process visualizer, you can also print an annotated version of the approval
process, where numbers appearing on the diagram correspond to details in a table, which is
included in the printable view.
Having the process set out diagrammatically can help in the understanding of the
following:
The steps necessary for a record to be approved
The designated approvers for each step

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 394 ]
The criteria used to trigger the approval process
The specific actions taken when a record is approved, rejected, recalled, or first
submitted for approval
In summary, approval processes can be a powerful tool to monitor an internal process that
must be completed prior to moving forward with the business activities. They also provide
great visibility into the timeliness of the business process. Here, you can use approvals to
capture the length of time it takes to get expenses, say, approved, which can then help to
put measures in place to improve organizational processes.
Visual Workflow
Visual Workflow allows you to build collections of screens, known as flows, to guide users
through the process of collecting and updating data.
Working with flows involves the creation of a structured set of steps to enable users to
complete specified business processes. These business processes could be, for example, call
scripts for a customer support team, questionnaires and surveys for customers or employee
interaction, or processes to handle incoming sales enquiries for your organization.
Use cases for flows are many and varied, and the Visual Workflow options allow you to
create screens that collect and display information, create and update Salesforce records,
and carry out logic based on input from users, all from within the drag-and-drop Visual
Workflow user interface.
Configuring Visual Workflow
Working with Visual Workflow involves the following three concepts: flow design, flow
management, and runtime. Flow design and management are carried out using the Flow
Designer, which is part of the Salesforce CRM setup options. Once the flow has been
designed and created, you can then manage it by setting properties, activating, deactivating,
deleting, or running it all from within the Salesforce CRM application. Finally, users can
then run activated flows, again from within Salesforce. Here, you can configure the flow to
be run from a custom button, link or tab, from within a Visualforce page, or directly, using
the Salesforce flow URL.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 395 ]
Flow Designer
Visual Workflow and Flow Designer are accessed by following the path Setup | Create |
Workflow | Flows.
To create and manage flows in Cloud Flow Designer, click on New Flow or edit an existing
flow.
Flow Designer has a drag and drop user interface that lets you configure screens and define
branching logic without writing any code, as shown in the following screenshot:
The Flow Designer user interface has the following features and functional sections:
Buttons in the button-bar section let you save, close, undo or redo, view
properties of, or run the flow.
Status indicator on the right-hand side of the bar indicates that the flow is active,
saved, or whether it has any warnings or errors.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 396 ]
The Palette tab lists all the element types available for the flow. Here you can
drag and drop elements from the Palette onto the Canvas to configure them.
The Resources tab lets you create new resources for the flow, such as variables,
constants, formulas, and so on. Once created, the new resources will appear in
the Explorer tab.
The Explorer tab is a library of all the elements and resources that have been
created for the flow.
The Description pane is used to show details for the selected item when you click
on them in the Pallet, Resources, and Explorer tabs.
The Canvas is where your flow is built. Here, elements are added from the
Palette then configured and connected to create the structured set of steps for the
flow.
Flow Designer considerations
It is useful to have a general idea for how the flow will be built in Salesforce CRM to help
ensure a successful and smooth implementation. Consider the following considerations
before starting to configure your flow:
Use a Step element as a placeholder if you are unsure of exactly which element
you need at a given point in the flow. This allows for the iterative building of the
flow, allowing you to further refine it as your understanding of the process
develops.
To select multiple elements, either use the left-mouse to click and select an area
around the multiple elements to highlight them, or use control-click to select
individual elements. You can then press the Delete button on your keyboard to
delete them all at once.
To view the description or details for an item in the Palette, Resources, or
Explorer tab, click on the item and look at the caption in the Description pane.
Now, let's look at the Palette, Resources, and Explorer tabs in more detail.
The Palette tab
The Palette tab lists the element types available for the flow. Here, you can drag and drop
elements from the Palette tab onto the main canvas. Once created, the new elements appear
in the Explorer tab.
Elements are the key aspects of building flows. They represent an action such as collecting

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 397 ]
or displaying information from users, or querying, creating, updating, and deleting data
records. Elements can be connected to create a structured set of steps consisting of screens,
inputs, outputs, and branch logic through which users are guided.
Elements
The following elements are available in Cloud Flow Designer:
Step: A placeholder element you can use to quickly sketch out a flow and then
convert into a Screen element
Screen: A user-facing screen that can be used to collect input or display output
Decision: Uses conditions to determine where to route users next in the flow
Assignment: Set or change the value of variables
Record Create: Create a new record and insert resource values into its fields
Record Update: Update one or multiple records' fields with resource values
Record Lookup: Find a record and assign its fields to variables
Record Delete: Delete records that match certain criteria
Subflows: Nested flow
Apex Plug-In: Logic built in Apex code via apex classes or AppExchange
packages

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 398 ]
Using the Step element
From within the Draft Tools section, the Step element can be used to diagram the flow of
your business process. The Step element is simply a placeholder, and it cannot be used in
an active flow. It is used instead to quickly diagram out the series of steps for the business
process that is being built. Once you have each Step in place and you want to get the flow
activated, you can hover over the Step and click on the Convert Element (double arrow
icon) option. This then enables the conversion of the draft Step into a Screen element,
which is the building block for every flow.
Using the Screen element
The Screen element can be created by using the Convert Element option on a Step element
as described previously, or it can be created from within the USER INTERFACE section.
The screen elements contain the series of windows that the user will see, along with the
built-in navigational buttons (for previous and next).
The Screen element has various options for user interaction, and it is from the Add a Field
tab on the Edit screen where you can select from the following sections: INPUTS,
CHOICES, MULTI-SELECT CHOICES, or OUTPUTS, as shown in the following
screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 399 ]
Using the Decision element
Having interacted with a Screen element, the user may then need to be directed along a
specified path in the flow depending on how they responded. The Decision element under
the LOGIC section allows you to configure how users move through the flow by setting up
conditions for each decision outcome.
The Decision element is used to navigate the flow and route the user to the next screen or
interaction based on their response within the previous Screen element. Within the
Decision element, you can create an Editable Outcome for each of the responses, as shown
in the following screenshot:

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 400 ]
The Resources tab
The Resources tab lets you create new resources for the flow, such as Variable, Constant,
Formula, and so on, as shown in the following screenshot:
After new resources have been created or items from the Palette tab have been added to a
flow, they appear in the Explorer tab.
The Explorer tab
By double-clicking on items in the Explorer tab, you can access the edit page for them. You
can click on an item to view details for the item in the Description pane. When viewing
items within the Explorer tab, the Description pane includes two subtabs:
Properties: Shows you information about the element or resource you have
selected, such as its label, unique name, description, and data type.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 401 ]
Usage: Lists the elements where the selected item is used. To see where one of the
listed elements is located on the canvas, hover over it and click on the magnify
icon, as shown in the following screenshot:
Saving a flow
After you have created a flow in Flow Designer, the options for saving are as follows:
Initial save: When saving for the first time, a dialog box appears. Enter a flow
name, unique name, and description. Once the flow has been saved, the unique
name cannot be modified.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 402 ]
Quick save: Once you have saved the flow, the Save button works as a quick-
save, overwriting your previous work. Note that the Save button is unavailable
when editing active flows. Here, you must use Save As to save the changes as
either a new flow or a new version of the flow.
Save as: Once you have saved the flow, this button is available with two options:
Save As New Flow, which opens a dialog box where you can input new details
and save as an entirely new flow, or Save As New Version, which saves the flow
as a new version of the current flow (as shown in the following screenshot). This
option is useful if you are about to make changes to a flow and want to keep the
old flow as a backup, just in case you need to retrieve it later:
 
Consider the following when saving a flow or flow version:
If you have the flow detail page open in one browser tab, then open a flow
version in a new browser tab to edit it, after saving and closing it, you
must refresh the first flow detail page before you can successfully run the
flow version you just edited. If you have changed the flow properties and
for some reason the save fails, the flow properties do not revert to the
previous values. Each flow can have up to 50 versions. You can update the
flow name and description when you save a new version, but not the
unique name.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 403 ]
Flow runtime considerations
Flows can be run directly from the flow URL or from a custom Web tab, link, or button
pointing to the flow URL.
Depending on how you wish to set up flows for your users, you have the following specific
options:
Add it as a custom link on a detail page
Add it as a custom button on a detail page
Add it as a link on the Home page
Add it as a flow within a Visualforce page
In order to run flows, users require either one of the following permissions to be set up:
Run Flows profile permission
Force.com Flow User field enabled on the user detail page
Consider the following when running flows:
Do not use the browser's back or forward buttons to navigate through a flow.
This may result in inconsistent data between the flow and Salesforce.
A single flow may have up to 50 different versions. When users run a flow, they
see the active version, which may not necessarily be the latest version.
Introduction to Lightning Process Builder
Lightning Process Builder is a workflow automation tool that allows you to automate
business processes. At the time of writing the capabilities of Lightning Process Builder is
evolving, but the tool allows you to generate a graphical representation of the process as it
is developed and built.
Lightning Process Builder allows you to carry out the following:
Create processes using a user-friendly, visual interface layout with point-and-
click features.
Design a full end-to-end process in one location instead of multiple dependent
workflow rules.
Automate some simple actions that previously needed Apex development and
apply the clicks not code approach.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 404 ]
At the time of writing, the usefulness and capabilities of the Lightning Process Builder tool
hovers between the two other workflow automation tools of Workflows and Visual
Workflows (covered in detail earlier in this chapter) and perhaps is the future tool for
Salesforce.
Due to the current limitations and the evolving nature of the Lightning Process Builder, this

Logic: Process Automation Cheatsheet documentation.
Lightning Process Builder provides a visual interface to build a process comprised of if/then
statements with actions that allow you to carry out the following:
Create a record
Update any related record
Create or update a record, and log a call using Quick actions
Send an e-mail alert
Post to Chatter
Submit an approval process
Invoke a different process from a process
Launch a Visual Workflow flow
Call Apex code
Send SOAP messages to external web services
Actions can be run immediately or scheduled. However, at the time of writing, the
scheduling capability in Lightning Process Builder is limited compared to Workflow
(described earlier in this chapter).
Generally, the Lightning Process Builder actions described previously can be set to trigger
from if/then statements and are fired when:
Records are created
Records are created or edited

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 405 ]
The if/then decision statements can be evaluated based on data in fields within the record
that started the process, via a formula, or skipped entirely (by returning true every time). In
addition, decisions can be evaluated as true or false by comparing the criteria with static
data, global variables, data on the present record, or data on related records.

Answers
Here are the answers to the six questions about workflow automation, workflow processes,
time-dependent workflow, initiating Approval Processes, approving or rejection Approval
Processes, and capabilities during Approval Processes to verify your understanding of
workflow automation and approval processes.
Answer 1 – Workflow Automation
The answer is, a) Workflow rules and actions.
Answer 2 – Workflow Processes
The answer is, a) Sending an e-mail alert to an account owner whenever updates are made
to the account by another user, b) Assigning a follow-up task to a marketing executive
whenever a new lead is entered in the system, and ,d) Automatically update an opportunity
field whenever the opportunity reaches a specified sales stage.
The answer c) Assigning a new lead to a queue, is not possible using workflow rules and
instead can be carried out using lead assignment rules (see Chapter 8, Introducing Sales
Cloud, Service Cloud, and Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM).

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 410 ]
Answer 3 – Time-dependent Workflow
The answer is, a) The rule is already active (here, you must deactivate the rule first),
c) The rule is deactivated, but has pending actions in the workflow queue (here, you must
allow the pending actions to complete or delete the pending action using the time-based
workflow queue, and, d) The rule criteria is set to evaluate when the record is created, and
every time it's edited.
Answer 4 – Initiating Approval Processes
The answer is, a) Approval processes can be set to automatically filter which users are
initially involved with the approval process, b) Approval processes can be set to allow users
to choose a user to send the approval to, and d) Approval processes show an error message
if the record does not meet the entry criteria.
The answer, c) and e) are not correct for the following reasons, respectively: Approval
processes can be set to automatically assign approvers from a queue but not to allow users
to choose a queue to send the approval to. Approval processes show an error message only,
and not a warning message showing the entry criteria if the record does not meet the entry
criteria.
Answer 5 – Approving or Rejecting approval Processes
The answer is, a) If enabled, approvers can approve or reject approval requests by e-mail, c)
If enabled, approvers can approve or reject approval requests by Chatter, and d) If enabled
and a user set, an approver's delegate can approve or reject approval requests.
The answer b) is not correct because approval requests can be set to be approved or rejected
by individuals in a queue.
Answer 6 – During Approval Processes
The answer is, c) During an approval process approvers can reassign approval requests and
d). During an approval process, approvers can view approval requests on their Salesforce
homepage.

Implementing Business Processes in Salesforce CRM
[ 411 ]
The answers a), b), and c) are not correct for the following reasons, respectively: during an
approval process, the record is not locked for admins and can also be edited by the
approver. An approver's delegate can approve requests, but cannot reassign approval
requests. Approvers can access an approval page from outside Salesforce as well as from
within the Salesforce application.
Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the workflow automation features within the Salesforce CRM
application through the use of workflow rules and approval processes. We walked through
the configuration of these functions and discovered how they can be used to automate and
streamline the key business processes for your organization.
We also looked at Visual Workflow and learned how flows and the Lightning Process
Builder can be used to build screens that guide users through the process of collecting and
updating data. By leveraging workflow automation, your users benefit from greater control
over routine activities and elimination of redundant tasks.
Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce
workflow automation and approval processes.
In the following chapter, we will look at the functional areas of Salesforce CRM and the
facilities for sales and marketing automation, service and support, and enterprise social
networking.

Introducing Sales Cloud,
Service Cloud, and the
Collaborative Features of
Salesforce CRM
In the previous chapter, we looked at the methods to automate business tasks and activities
along with approval processes to align business rules with process automation in
Salesforce.
This chapter will give you an overview of the functional areas within Salesforce CRM,
where we will look at the process from campaign to customer and beyond.
Within the functional areas of this chapter, we will touch on points where business teams
concerned with marketing, sales, and customer service have to agree on roles and
responsibilities for aspects of the business process. These functional areas of the business
can all be managed in Salesforce CRM, and in this chapter we will look at the Sales Cloud,
Service Cloud, and Collaboration Cloud features provided by Salesforce.
Finally, you will be presented with a number of questions about the key features of
Salesforce CRM administration in the functional areas of Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and
Chatter, which are all covered in this chapter.
We will now look at each of the following core Salesforce CRM functions:
Marketing administration
Sales automation

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 413 ]
Customer service and support automation
Enterprise social networking and collaboration with Salesforce Chatter
Functional overview of Salesforce CRM
The Salesforce CRM functions are related to each other and, as mentioned previously, have
cross-over areas, which can be represented as shown in the following diagram:
Marketing administration
Marketing administration is available in Salesforce CRM under the application suite known
as the Marketing Cloud.
The core functionality enables organizations to manage marketing campaigns from
initiation to lead development in conjunction with the sales team. The features in the
marketing suite can help to measure the effectiveness of each campaign by analyzing the
leads and opportunities generated as a result of specific marketing activities.
Salesforce automation
Salesforce automation is the core feature set within Salesforce CRM and is used to manage
the sales process and activities. It enables salespeople to automate manual and repetitive
tasks and provides them with information related to existing and prospective customers. In
Salesforce CRM, Salesforce automation is known as the Sales Cloud and helps salespeople
manage sales activities, leads and contact records, opportunities, quotes, and forecasts.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 414 ]
Customer service and support automation
Customer service and support automation within Salesforce CRM is known as the Service
Cloud and allows support teams to automate and manage the requests for service and
support by existing customers. Using the Service Cloud features, organizations can handle
customer requests such as the return of faulty goods or repairs, complaints, or provide
advice about products and services.
Associated with the functional areas described previously are features and mechanisms to
help users and customers collaborate and share information known as enterprise social
networking.
Enterprise social networking with Salesforce
Chatter
Enterprise social network capabilities within Salesforce CRM enable organizations to
connect with people and securely share business information in real time. Social networking
within an enterprise serves to connect both employees and customers and enables business
collaboration. In Salesforce CRM, the enterprise social network suite is known as Salesforce
Chatter.
Salesforce CRM record life cycle
The capabilities of Salesforce CRM enables the processing of campaigns through to
customer acquisition and beyond, as shown in the following diagram:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 415 ]
At the start of the process, it is the responsibility of the marketing team to develop suitable
campaigns in order to generate leads. Campaign management is carried out using
Marketing Administration tools and has links to the lead, as well as any opportunities that
have been influenced by the campaign.
When validated, leads are converted to accounts, contacts, and opportunities. This can be
the responsibility of either the marketing or sales teams and requires a suitable sales process
to have been agreed upon. In Salesforce CRM, an account is the company or organization
and a contact is an individual associated with an account.
Opportunities can either be generated from lead conversion or may be entered directly by
the sales team. As described earlier in this book, the structure of Salesforce requires account
ownership to be established – which sees inherited ownership of the opportunity. Account
ownership is usually the responsibility of the sales team.
Opportunities are worked through a sales process using sales stages, where the stage is
advanced to the point where they are set as Closed Won/Closed and represent final sales.
Opportunity information should be logged in the organization's financial system.
Upon acceptance of the deal by the finance team (and perhaps delivery of the goods or
service), the post-customer acquisition process is then enabled, which is when the account
and contact can be recognized as a customer. Here, the customer relationships concerning
incidents and requests are managed by escalating cases within the customer services and
support automation suite.
Marketing administration
Marketing administration in Salesforce CRM provides closed-loop marketing automation
from within the marketing app, which can be accessed from the App Menu at the top-right
corner of the Salesforce CRM screen.
Marketing administration enables integrated marketing functions such as campaign
management, lead management, reporting and analysis, response tracking, and campaign
effectiveness and it allows users from various departments to centrally access marketing
activity.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 416 ]
By default, the marketing administration features provide some level of read-only access to
all users. However, to create, edit, and delete campaigns, and carry out advanced campaign
and lead management functions, users must have the Marketing User License set on their
user record, shown as follows:
The Marketing User License is available as standard for organizations with
Enterprise or Unlimited editions and can be applied to any active user.
The following key features are available within Salesforce CRM marketing administration:
Campaign management
Lead management
Campaign management
With targeted marketing campaigns, companies can build market awareness, generate
leads, and learn from their campaign results to fine-tune offers to various customer
segments.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 417 ]
The campaign management feature in Salesforce CRM allows your users to manage and
track outbound marketing activities. These can be direct mail, roadshow, online or print
advertising, e-mail, or other types of marketing initiatives.
Some CRM systems have sales and marketing features separated, requiring marketing and
sales users to log on to two separate modules; however, with Salesforce CRM, a dedicated
Campaign tab is provided to enable marketing and sales users to work together within a
single system.
Within the Campaign tab, the marketing team can access sales information for their
campaigns and the sales team have insight into the marketing activities that affect their
accounts, contacts, and leads. Campaigns can also be organized into hierarchies for flexible
analysis of related marketing initiatives.
By integrating the marketing and sales effort for campaign and lead management activities,
far greater collaboration can be achieved.
Essential success criteria for campaigns can be captured and used to further develop the
definition of marketing targets. This enables marketing departments to become more
accountable and to better demonstrate their marketing Return On Investment (ROI)
The steps to consider when managing and working with campaigns in Salesforce CRM are
as follows:
Campaign planning
Campaign setup
Campaign creation
Campaign execution
Campaign responses
Campaign effectiveness
Campaign planning
Before starting to build and run campaigns, it is useful to have an overall plan of the goals
and objectives of the campaign, such as the core processes and the type of campaign, such
as mass marketing e-mails, hosting a conference, sending direct mail, and so on.
The targets for the campaign also need to be identified and whether they are existing
customers, existing leads, or new leads should be defined. With existing leads, you can use
lead scoring and lead status to facilitate customer segmentation. For example, a series of
archived status definitions could be used, such as No Interest, Future Interest, Nurture, and
so on.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 418 ]
Consider how you need to analyze and report on campaigns.
It is worth considering this at an early stage so you can look to create custom campaign
fields. You can customize campaigns so that you can improve the targeting and customer
segmentation and help to compare and analyze which types of campaigns are the most
effective for your sales and marketing teams.
Your marketing team may also want to target new leads through the use of third-party lists.
These third-party lists of suspects, prospects, or leads can be flagged in Salesforce with a
specific indicator. By flagging with a different record type, or assigning to a different queue,
these lead records can be kept apart from existing prospects so that any pre-qualification or
de-duplicating can be done before they are available for use in campaigns.
Campaign setup
When setting up campaign management, you should identify who should have access to
your campaigns.
To create, edit, and delete campaigns and configure advanced campaign
setup, users must have the Marketing User license checked on their user
record.
By default, all users have read access to campaigns, but to create, edit, or delete campaigns,
users must have the Create permission on their profile, shown as follows:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 419 ]
When starting new types of campaigns, your marketing and sales teams should collaborate
to agree on the customer information that is to be captured. Here, you can use the standard
fields for both the Campaign and Campaign Member objects or create new custom fields as
appropriate.
Standard campaign ﬁelds
The following key standard fields are available on the Campaign object:

Member status values
New campaigns have two default member status values: Sent and Responded. These are
populated from the Campaign Member Status picklist that we looked at earlier.
Non-system administrator users can, however, overwrite the status values (for the specific
campaign record only) from within the campaign detail page by clicking on the Advanced
Setup button, as shown in the following screenshot:
Here, your users can edit or replace them, or create new ones as necessary:
Create multiple responded values:
You can have more than one Responded value. These are summed
together to produce the calculated field Total Responses.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 426 ]
Target lists
Target lists is a marketing term used to describe the individuals or types of people that are
to be included as part of the marketing campaign.
In some situations, such as with an online advertising campaign, people are not specifically
set up as individual targets. Here, the campaign would usually be set up in Salesforce as
one without members.
If your campaign is targeting individuals, it is important to create a target list that has been
segmented according to criteria that will result in the highest quality returns.
Targeting existing leads or contacts
To target existing leads or contacts, you can use the following methods in Salesforce CRM:
Method
Description
Use the Campaign Detail page
Click on the Manage Members button to add multiple
campaign members
Create Lead or Contact reports
Click on the Add to Campaign button to add multiple
campaign members
Use Lead or Contact List views
Click on the Add to Campaign button to add multiple
campaign members
Use the Lead or Contact Detail
pages
Click on the Add to Campaign button to add a single
campaign member
Using the campaign detail page
To add multiple campaign members from the Campaign Detail page, users should select
the Manage Members button, as shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 427 ]
You can add existing contacts or leads by selecting Add Members – Search from the
Manage Members drop-down button on a Campaign Detail page.
Creating lead or contact reports
To add multiple campaign members from either lead or contact reports, carry out the
following steps:
Create a custom lead or contact report.
1.
In the Select Criteria step, enter up to three criteria to segment the report data.
2.
For example, to target all CFOs at Electronics or Energy companies with an annual revenue
greater than ten million, you would set the following:
Title equals CFO
Industry equals Technology, Telecommunications (using a comma to indicate an
OR Boolean result)
Annual Revenue greater than 10,000,000
Now you can run the report and use the Add to Campaign button, as shown in the
following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 428 ]
Using lead or contact list views
From within a lead or contact list view, you can click on the Add toCampaign button to add
multiple Campaign members.
Using the lead or contact detail pages
You can use the Add to Campaign button within the Lead Detail and Contact Detail pages
to add that record as an individual campaign, as shown in the following screenshot:
Targeting new leads or prospects
When using externally purchased lists of new prospects within Salesforce, it is advisable to
flag the records with a specific third-party designation (say by record type or custom
picklist value). These records can then be pre-qualified before being added to any campaign
or sales activity. What is particularly important is the de-duplication of any new leads
against existing records in your Salesforce database so that you can determine which are
existing customers or leads.
Salesforce does not recommend mass importing rented or purchased lists of prospects into
Salesforce, as these lists are usually controlled by the list vendor and may have restriction or
limited use policies. Here, you should simply make use of the list of names as your target
list and only after the prospect has responded to your campaign should you import the lead
record.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 429 ]
Campaign execution
Although campaign execution activities occur outside the Salesforce CRM application
during the execution of either an offline or an online campaign, there are some features of
the campaign activity that can aid using the export facilities within Salesforce.
Users can use Salesforce to generate lists of accounts and individuals for mailing houses. or
e-mailing specialist partners to send out mass marketing e-mails used in both online and
offline events (such as trade shows, advertisements, direct mail, and so on).
There are various options available for integrating Salesforce with other solutions, including
provision for mass e-mailing. Integration solutions are covered later in this book, where
sources include the AppExchange directory (a Salesforce.com sponsored market place for
accredited products and services).
Salesforce can be used to deliver mass e-mails, but the application is not intended for large
volume mass e-mail marketing, and there are limits to the quantity of e-mails that can be
sent.
For each Salesforce application, a total of 1,000 e-mails can be sent per day to external e-mail
addresses. Using the Enterprise Edition, the maximum number of external addresses
(unique or non-unique) you can include in a mass e-mail is 500, and for Unlimited and
Performance Edition the limit is 1000.
The mass e-mail limits do not take unique addresses into account. For
example, if you have john.smith@widgetsXYZ.com in your mass e-mail
500 times, that counts as 500 against any limit.
You can build an integrated web form to automatically capture individuals as leads in
Salesforce. This is detailed later on in this chapter in the Lead Management section under
Marketing administration.
Campaign responses
After the campaign has been executed, your company will want to track the responses,
which can include:
Website responses using a form on your website where you can set up a Web-to-
Lead form to create a target page with a response form. All responses appear in
Salesforce as leads but can be linked to the campaign. This is covered later in this
chapter.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 430 ]
Mass update or offline responses using the campaign member import wizards to
import a list of leads or contacts and their responses. Users need the Marketing
User profile or the Import Leads permission to use these wizards.
Manual responses; for example, when prospects and customers respond by
phone or e-mail, users can manually record these responses on the Campaign
History related list on the lead or Contact Detail page.
Campaign inﬂuence
To ensure existing opportunities are included in the results for the campaign, you can add
the campaign to the Campaign Influence related list on the opportunity, shown as follows.
The Campaign Influence related list is not included in the set of related
lists on the Opportunity Page Layout by default, so you may need to
include it on your chosen Opportunity Page Layout.
By setting the Primary Campaign Source flag (a checkbox on the Campaign Influence
record), the opportunity amount is included in the campaign statistics and reports, shown
as follows:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 431 ]
Campaign effectiveness
Campaign effectiveness can be analyzed using either the statistics on the campaign record
or by running campaign reports.
Campaign statistics
The summary fields on the Campaign Detail page, as shown in the following screenshot,
allows various statistics to be seen, such as the total number of responses, the amount of
business generated from the campaign, and so on:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM

The campaign statistics are automatically recalculated every time a campaign is saved.
When a lead gets converted to an opportunity, the campaign that was most recently
associated to the lead will automatically pass over to the opportunity.
Campaign reports
Reports can be accessed from the Reports tab by selecting the Campaign Reports folder, as
shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 433 ]
As an example, the Campaign ROI Analysis Report shows performance metrics and gives
you a figure for the return on investment for the campaign, as shown in the following
screenshot:
ROI calculation:
The ROI percentage calculation taken from the Campaign ROI Analysis
Report uses the following equation:((Total Value of Won Opportunities -
Actual Cost) / Actual Cost)) * 100. In the example shown, we have: ((30,000
– 2500)/2500))*100 = 1100%.
Note: all opportunities that are linked to the Campaign must be set to
Closed Won and the Campaign must be set as the Primary campaign for
them to be included in the Total Value of Won Opportunities amount.
Customizable Campaign Influence overview
Salesforce has improved upon the campaign influence mechanism described previously and
provides the Customizable Campaign Influence functionality.
Customizable Campaign Influence allows you to choose how the revenue from an
opportunity is attributed to multiple campaigns that are associated with it.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 434 ]
At the time of writing, the features that are common to Campaign Influence and
Customizable Campaign Influence are:
Auto-association with an opportunity
Can use a Salesforce Default Model which attributes 100% of revenue to the
primary campaign on the opportunity
Applies Campaign Influence on the opportunitiy as per the specified Model
At the time of writing, the features that are only available in Customizable Campaign
Influence are:
Ability to create custom Campaign Attribution Models
Allows Flexible Influence Attribution
Enables Campaign Attribution Models to be locked
Allows Campaign Influence to be applied on an opportunity for the given
Campaign Attribution Model
Produces Campaign Results on Campaigns for the given Campaign Attribution
Model
Allows API access
With Customizable Campaign Influence you can configure multiple ways to track how an
opportunity has benefited and been influenced by one or more campaigns. Each method of
tracking is achieved by creating a custom Campaign Attribution Model.
A default Attribution model which attributes 100% of revenue to the primary campaign on
an opportunity and 0% to any other campaigns that users assign to the opportunity is the
standard model for Customizable Campaign Influence.
The benefit of Customizable Campaign Influence is that it allows you to build more
flexibility in how revenue is attributed to campaigns by creating custom attribution models.
Examples of custom attribution models are:
Attributing 100% of the revenue to the initial campaign to have been associated
with the opportunity.
Attributing 100% of the revenue to the latest campaign to have been associated
with the opportunity.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 435 ]
Evenly distributing the revenue across all campaigns that have been associated
with the opportunity.
With Customizable Campaign Influence you can prevent users from manually creating or
updating campaign influence records which are associated to opportunities by locking the
Attribution Model. Here, the records that are a part of a locked Attribution Model can only
be updated via the Salesforce API.
With Customizable Campaign Influence the default Salesforce model is
always locked.
Lead management
Managing prospective customers appropriately often raises issues within companies. The
status and quality of prospect data can cause obstacles when trying to automate the
processing through the sales process. Prospect data often comes from various sources
which, if not carefully controlled, can make them difficult to accurately process.
Without a central system and agreed approach, there can be conflict between the marketing
team, who are often unable to trace what is happening to the prospects after distributing
them to sales, and the sales team, who are unable to verify the quality of the data. Salesforce
CRM helps bridge any gap between sales and marketing, and by using lead management
mechanisms it offers a way to improve the management and automation of the flow from
potential customers to a closed sales deal.
Leads are prospects or potential opportunities and are accessed in Salesforce CRM from the
Leads tab. They are sources of potential deals that usually need more qualification, and they
may be visitors to your website who requested more information, respondents to marketing
campaigns, trade show visitors, and so on. Leads are stored and managed separately to
account, contact, and opportunity records, which are covered later in this chapter.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 436 ]
Standard lead fields
The following key standard fields are available on the Lead object:
Field
Type
Description
Lead Owner Lookup (to
lead or
queue)
This field is the user or queue who owns the lead. A lead can be
owned by a person or stored in a queue. Here, you can allow
specified users to accept (and return) leads from a queue. This is
covered in more detail later in this section.
Last Name
Text
This field is the last name and is a required field. The last name is
copied over to the Last Name field on a contact record during the
lead conversion process.
Company
Text
This field is the company name and is a required field. The
company name is copied over to the company name on an account
record during the lead conversion process.
Lead Status
Picklist
This field is the status and is a required field. Salesforce
provides the following standard values: Open – Not Contacted,
Working – Contacted, Closed – Converted, and Closed – Not
Converted.
Lead Status is an important field used in the lead process
settings, as we will discover later on in this section.
Lead Source Picklist
This field is used to set the source from which the lead appeared.
Salesforce provides the following standard values: Web, Phone
Inquiry, Partner Referral, Purchased List, and Other.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 437 ]
The complete set of fields is shown in the following screenshot, where the picklist values
can be adapted to suit your organization. They are accessed by following the path Setup |
Customize | Leads | Fields:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 438 ]
Lead business process
Creating a business process within the lead management function involves agreeing on and
implementing the steps and field values that are to be recorded by the sales and marketing
teams during the lead life cycle.
The lead processes are accessed by following the path Setup | Leads | Lead Processes,
where processes can be created or edited, as shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 439 ]
You can now assign the status values for the lead, as shown in the following screenshot:
Finally, by associating the lead business process with one or more record types, this will
make it available to your users (based on their profile).
Creating leads in Salesforce CRM
There are several ways of creating lead records within the Salesforce CRM application. This
includes the manual entry of single leads by your users, the manual entry of leads by the
prospect themselves (using public facing web forms known as Web-to-Lead), or the manual
importing of multiple leads within the application by you or your users.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 440 ]
Creating lead records within the application
Leads can be manually created from either the Leads tab by clicking on the New button, or
from the Create New selection in the left-hand side bar, as shown in the following
screenshot:
Manually creating leads with Web-to-Lead
With the Web-to-Lead functionality in Salesforce CRM, leads can be directly entered into
your Salesforce application from a public-facing website. This means prospective
information can be gathered directly from the individual. This feature is used to generate
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) code, which can then be incorporated into the
required web page.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 441 ]
Lead settings
To enable the Web-to-Lead feature, you must first configure the appropriate lead settings
by following the path Setup | Customize | Leads | Settings. Now click on the Edit button
to display the page, as shown in the following screenshot:
Now select a Default Lead Owner and select the Notify Default Lead Owner checkbox to
automatically notify the default lead owner whenever a lead is assigned to them.
The default lead owner becomes the owner of any leads that are not auto-
assigned by lead assignment rules.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM

The Web-to-Lead settings
To enable the Web-to-Lead feature, you must first configure the Web-to-Lead Settings by 
following the path Setup | Customize | Leads | Web-To-Lead Settings. Now click on the
Edit button to display the page, as shown in the following screenshot:
Now check the Web-to-Lead Enabled checkbox, select the user who will be set as the
creator whenever the lead is entered from an online web form, and finally create Web-to-
Lead e-mail auto-response rules to determine which e-mails to send to prospects when they
submit information online. Then, click on Save.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 443 ]
Generating the Web-to-Lead HTML code
To generate the Web-to-Lead HTML code, follow the path Setup | Customize | Leads |
Web-To-Lead. Now click on the Create Web-To-Lead Form button to display the page, as
shown in the following screenshot:
Now select the fields to include in the form and specify a URL that users will be taken to
after submitting the form. Finally, click on the Generate button and then copy the generated
HTML code and send it to the team responsible for the website in your organization.
The page style can be customized for your website, but the core form elements that have
been generated within the HTML code should not be changed.
With the Web-to-Lead feature, you can capture up to 500 leads per day.
To increase the limit of 500 leads per day:
This feature may be increased by sending a request to Salesforce customer
support, although there may be additional costs for this increase.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 444 ]
Web-to-Lead auto-response rules
Auto-response rules provide a method to customize any communication that is sent back to
an individual after they have filled out a web lead form. These auto-response rules can
contain logic to determine which e-mail template and what content to send to leads that
have been generated using Web-to-Lead.
To enable auto-response rules, follow the path Setup | Leads | Auto-response Rules. Then,
click on the New or Edit button, as shown in the following screenshot:
Here, you first create the rule detail and name and activate the rule. Then, you add the rule
entries that contain the logic and where multiple rule entries may be created. Rule entries
require the following:
An order of execution
The criteria for when the rule is triggered
A sent from e-mail address detail
An e-mail template to be used to send to the respondent

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 445 ]
Any e-mails that are sent are included in the daily limit of 1,000 mass e-
mails for an organization.
Manual importing of multiple leads
To import leads, follow the path Setup | Data Management | Import Leads. Now follow
the on-screen instructions to export your data from its current source and label each column
in the file with the correct field name, as shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 446 ]
Only users with the Import Leads permission on their profile (in the
general user permissions section) have access to the importing leads
feature, where files of up to 50,000 leads can be imported.
A lead assignment rule can automatically assign leads to users or queues based on values in
lead fields. Alternatively, a Record Owner field in the import file can determine lead
ownership for each imported lead.
Without a lead assignment rule or Record Owner field, imported leads are automatically
assigned to the user that has carried out the import.
The Import Queue shows the status of the import. You will be notified by e-mail when your
import is complete (this notification may take up to 24 hours).
Marketing users with the Marketing User profile can also import new
leads by selecting Add Members – Import File from the Manage
Members drop-down button on the Campaign Detail page.
Lead queue
Queues can be thought of as a storage location to group leads together, usually by
geographic region or business function. Leads remain in the queue until they are assigned
or accepted by users. Users who have been included as part of the queue can access and
accept the records by clicking on the Accept button, as shown in the following screenshot:
Whenever you create a lead queue, Salesforce automatically generates a
lead list view to enable users to access the records in the queue.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 447 ]
Creating and adding users to a lead queue
To create and provide users with access to a lead queue, follow the path Setup | Manage
Users | Queues | New.
Here, you can carry out the following: name the queue, select the supported object
(selection being either lead or case), and assign the queue member (selection being either
users, public groups, roles, or role and subordinates).
You can also set up the queue so that e-mails are sent to the queue members (using a default
e-mail address for the queue) whenever a case is assigned to the queue.
Lead assignment rules
Lead assignment rules determine how leads are automatically assigned to users or a queue.
They contain rule entries, which are predefined business rules that determine the lead
routing.
Lead assignment rules can be accessed by following the path Setup | Customize | Leads |
Assignment Rules.
Only one lead assignment rule can be active at any given time but each rule can have
multiple criteria, as shown here:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 448 ]
Criteria are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the list. When there are multiple
rules that can be applied, you can set the priority for the criteria by setting the most specific
criteria at number one and then adding more criteria numbers that are more generic. The
following screenshot shows a simple example and use case of multiple criteria rules, which
is used to assign leads according to a geographic flag by using the Country field:
Lead conversion
Lead qualification depends on your business process and should have been developed in
conjunction with both the marketing and sales team.
As part of the lead conversion routine, certain key information contained on the lead record
is mapped to the Salesforce CRM object's accounts, contacts, and optionally the opportunity
records. During lead conversion, new records are created for these objects, where the
account record name field will contain the Company Name field value from the lead, and
the contact record name field will be populated from the Name field within the lead record.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 449 ]
Any existing account or contact records are automatically checked before
the lead conversion to avoid record duplication.
Opportunities that are created upon lead conversion contain default values for the required
fields, where the Close Date defaults to the last day of the current quarter and Sales Stage
is set to the first value in the Stage picklist.
During the lead conversion, there is no opportunity amount value set on
the resulting opportunity.
To convert a lead, select the lead that is to be converted either by clicking on the Lead tab
and selecting from the list view or by searching and then clicking on Convert on the Lead
Detail page, as shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 450 ]
The lead conversion screen will be displayed where you can check the owner of the new
records. Here, you can choose to send the record owner an automated notification e-mail.
You can also set the status of the converted lead and also specify that a new task is created
for the record owner to act as a follow-up task, as shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 451 ]
Before creating any new account or contact records, the Salesforce CRM application
attempts to match an existing account, contact names, and the name of the lead. Where
there is a match you will have the option of selecting the existing records, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Clicking on the Convert button completes the lead conversion process and results in the
following:
The company name from the lead becomes the account name
The lead name from the lead becomes the contact name
The opportunity and contact are associated with the account
Any campaigns related to the lead are associated with the opportunity
Converted leads can no longer be viewed in the Leads tab, and the only
way to view the record is to create a lead report. When customizing your
report, enter a filter option of Converted equals True to view converted
leads.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 452 ]
Lead conversion field mappings
There are standard field mappings between the lead and account, contact, and opportunity
records that are provided by Salesforce for the lead conversion process; however, you can
extend these. To extend the mappings, follow the path Setup | Customize | Leads | Fields.
Now navigate to the Lead Custom Fields & Relationships section at the bottom of the
page, as shown in the following screenshot:
Extending the field mappings may become necessary whenever you add required custom
fields on either the account, contact, or opportunity records, which are to be populated from
the lead records. This is done as shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 453 ]
It is important to ensure the field mapping is in place whenever you have
certain mandatory fields or rules for your account, contacts, or
opportunities. This ensures that the quality of data is preserved. You can
enable the setting Require Validation for Converted Leads as shown in
the screenshot shown in the section Lead settings to enforce the validation
logic during the lead conversion process.  By disabling the setting Require
Validation for Converted Leads the validation logic for required custom
fields and workflow or validation rules is not enforced during the lead
conversion process.
Salesforce automation
Salesforce automation allows the management and control of the phases required for the
sales process within a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Enabling and
automating these phases within CRM systems helps to improve the quality and also
minimizes the time that sales representatives spend on each phase.
Salesforce automation in Salesforce.com is performed within the Sales App, which can be
accessed from the App Menu at the top-right corner of the Salesforce CRM screen.
At the core of the Sales App in Salesforce CRM are the account, contact, and opportunity
management functions for tracking and recording each stage in the sales process for new
and existing customers.
Accounts can be sorted by standard views or customized views, and users can add new
accounts and edit existing accounts. Associated contacts and activities are also listed in the
same page of the account where users can manipulate other operations, such as viewing,
adding, and editing as necessary. Account views can be filtered based on time variables,
such as by viewing recently modified or created accounts, new accounts this week, and so
on.
Account management
In Salesforce CRM, account management is carried out using the facilities found in the
Accounts tab and is typically where customer information is located.
Account records are used to store the company information from converted leads and can
also be used for the storage of company information for partners, suppliers, and even
competitors.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 454 ]
Accounts may be considered as business accounts from a Business-to-Business (B2B)
perspective and are usually the company records stored within the application. However,
Salesforce provides another variety of account called a Person Account, which allows
organizations with a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) business model to manage the
relationships with individuals. The Business account and Person Account records
offer very similar features and fields; however, Person accounts do not have certain fields or
features, such as a Reports To field, a Parent Account field, or the Account Hierarchy
feature.
Person accounts are not enabled by default in the Salesforce CRM
application and are only available by request to Salesforce customer
support.
Business account information consists of company name, type, company website, industry,
annual revenue, billing and shipping addresses, account record owner, date of creation and
modification, and so on.
Naming convention for accounts:
Having consistent account names is essential for ensuring clean and
accurate account data. It can be useful to adopt an appropriate account
naming policy to be used by all users in Salesforce. One way to achieve
this is to ensure that accounts are named using their full legal name
wherever possible.
As described earlier in this book, accounts are also the primary mechanism used in the
organization of records.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 455 ]
They are used within the record sharing and ownership hierarchy and are the parent object
for standard objects, such as contacts, opportunities, and so on. When changing ownership
of account records, you have the option to re-assign these child records, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Contact management
Contact management is performed using the facilities found in the Contacts tab. Contacts
are the individuals that your users want to keep in touch with. For the sales team, this is
likely to be people such as purchasers and key decision makers. For the marketing team,
this may include the CEOs and CFOs and other influencers. For support, the contacts could
be any of the users of the product or service that your organization provides.
Salesforce CRM provides the facility for users to store, view, sort, filter, delete, edit, and
find contact information which may or may not be associated with accounts. Each contact is
recorded with details such as title, contact details (address, cell phone, work phone, fax, and
e-mail address), date of creation and modification, and contact record owner.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 456 ]
Activity management
Activities in Salesforce are made up of tasks and events. Unlike other areas of functionality,
there is no access to Activities from the tab; instead, they are created and viewed from
related lists on other types of records, such as accounts, contacts, cases, and so on. Users can
view activities both in the context of a relevant item (such as where they relate to an
account, for example) or as a standalone mechanism from their calendar and task list from
the Salesforce CRM homepage.
The Activity History-related list of a record shows all completed tasks, logged phone calls,
and expired events, such as meetings, outbound e-mails, and so on, for the record and any
linked records.
Cloud Scheduler
Creating and scheduling appointments with customers is a central activity of most
customer-oriented businesses. Marketing, sales, and customer support teams spend time
getting in touch with prospective leads and customers and use a variety of means to agree
on a time and place to meet.
To improve this activity, Salesforce provides the Cloud Scheduler facility, which is an
automated system used to manage the scheduling and presentation of suitable appointment
times to individuals through a Web interface.
Salesforce has announced the planned retirement of Cloud Scheduler at
the time of writing. From Winter '17 onwards Cloud Scheduler is no
longer available for new orgs and will be disabled in the Winter '18 release
and no longer available for all existing organizations.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 457 ]
All the responses from invitees are then tracked by Salesforce and a date and time that fits
with everyone can then be selected and chosen as confirmation for the meeting.
As part of the Cloud Scheduler feature, Salesforce creates a unique web
page for the meeting which displays the proposed meeting times. When
invitees visit the web page, they can select the times that are suitable for
them , and then send a response. Cloud Scheduler setup.
The settings for the Cloud Scheduler can be configured by following the path Setup |
Customize | Activities | Cloud Scheduler. The New Meeting Request button for the
Cloud Scheduler can be added to page layouts with an Open Activities-related list, such as
contacts, leads, or Person Accounts (if enabled).
For users to request a meeting with a person account, you may also need to add the Email
field to the page layout by following the path Setup | Customize | Accounts | Person
Accounts | Page Layouts.
You can also include the New Meeting Request button on the user's home page. This is
displayed above the Scheduled Meetings and Requested Meetings tabs, as shown in the
following screenshot:

Requesting a meeting
Users can either navigate to the contact or Lead Detail page of the individual they want to
request a meeting with through the Open Activities-related list or navigate to the calendar
section on their homepage. They then click on the New Meeting Request button to display
the Meeting Request page. Here, users click to invite other Salesforce users, leads, contacts,
or Person Accounts to the meeting and click in the calendar to propose up to five meeting
times, or they can choose to let the Salesforce application automatically propose times, as
shown in the following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM

Invitees response
Salesforce e-mails a meeting request to the invitees so they can pick the times they are
available. Within the e-mail is a link which the invitees click called Respond toThis
Request, which opens the meeting's web page. Within the web page, invitees can then pick
the proposed times that are suitable for them and then send a reply, as shown in the
following screenshot:

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 461 ]
Conﬁrmation of the meeting
Salesforce keeps track of all the responses sot users can see when each invitee is available,
and they can then select the best time to meet and confirm the meeting, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Opportunity management
Opportunity management is performed using the facilities found in the Opportunities tab.
Opportunities in Salesforce CRM are the sales deals that the sales team in your organization
creates and updates. By adding new opportunities, the sales team is building the sales
pipeline, which will be used to produce figures for both individual sales forecasts, as well as
the wider company sales forecast.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 462 ]
Opportunity records are also important for other users in your organization to track, such
as the marketing team, who may want to monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns,
or the customer support teams who may need to have an up-to-date view of customer
spending when negotiating support contracts.
Product, Price Book, and Price Book Entry
A Product in Salesforce CRM is an item that your organization provides quotes for and
ultimately sells to customers. These product items can be goods or services with which your
sales users can add to quotes and opportunities. As an administrator you can create a
Product and associate it with a price in a Price Book.
A Price Book contains products along with the associated price. A Product can be listed in
multiple Price Books to allow the selling of goods and services at different prices for
different categories of sales (this might depend on which customer a product is being sold
to, to which geographic location, or by the total quantity of the products).
The variation and combination of a Product with a price in a Price Book is managed in 
Salesforce CRM using a junction object called a Price Book Entry.
Service cloud
At the core of the service cloud in Salesforce CRM is the case management functionality,
which is used to track and record activities dealing with customers, service, and support
automation. Case records, in Salesforce, are associated with contacts and/or accounts.
A case is a detailed description of a customer's feedback, problem, or question. Your
organization can use cases to track and solve your customer's issues. Cases can be manually
entered from within the Cases tab by the support or sales team after, say, a phone call or e-
mail to or from a customer. However, you can also set up more complex Web-to-Case and
Email-to-Case objects to obtain customer responses from your company's website and
customer e-mails.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 463 ]
Case management
There are number of ways case records, which may consist of recording phone calls or e-
mail communication, can be entered into the Salesforce CRM application. Case records can
be entered manually by users accessing the Cases tab, but there are other methods available
for you to consider, which include:
Automatic creation from an e-mail usingEmail-to-Case sent by a customer
Automatic creation from a web form using Web-to-Case entered by a customer
Email-to-Case
Email-to-Case provides the facility for automatic case creation when an e-mail is sent to a
preconfigured e-mail address.
Web-to-Case
Web-to-Case provides the facility where customers can submit support cases online.
The Web-To-Case feature can be used to generate up to 500 new cases a
day.
When setting up Web-to-Case, auto-response rules can be created to use e-mail templates to
send an acknowledging e-mail to customers who have created cases using the web form.
Case queues
Queues can be thought of as a storage location to group cases together, usually by a
geographic region or business function. Cases remain in the queue until they are assigned
to or accepted by users.
Whenever you create a case queue, Salesforce automatically generates a case list view to
enable users to access the records in the queue.
Case records can be assigned to queues manually or automatically using assignment rules.
Case queues and assignment rules are very similar to the queues and assignment rules
available for leads.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 464 ]
Assignment rules
Only one case assignment rule can be active at any one time, and each rule can contain
multiple criteria up to a maximum of 25 criteria.
Escalation rules
Escalation rules are used to automatically escalate an unresolved case within a certain
period of time. This escalation is triggered on the Age Over setting (when the Age field is
overdue).
The modification of a field on a case is the only thing that stops the clock for escalation rules
if the rule is set to disable after the field is first modified, or based on the last modification
time of the case.
For each escalation rule you can specify up to five actions to escalate the
case over increasing periods of time. The Age Over field specifies the
number of hours after which a case should be escalated if it has not been
closed. This time is calculated from the date field set in the Specify how
escalation times are set field. No two escalation actions can have the same
set time period.
Sending an e-mail to a customer from the case record does not reset the case escalation.
Only when the record – and not a related list – is changed is the case escalation time reset.
Escalation rules use business hours to determine when to escalate a case. The case feature
can include business hours in multiple time zones and can associate cases to various time
zones.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 465 ]
Each escalation rule can have multiple criteria settings and up to five escalation actions per
entry. An example of one such action is shown in the following screenshot:
Early triggers
The early triggers mechanism enables case escalation to get expedited to the previous
quarter hour slot. The setting is activated for the organization as a whole and is used to
ensure that customer Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are met.
The early triggers on the escalation box allow you to specify whether cases should escalate
sooner than the Age Over time specified.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 466 ]
As an example, we can consider that the escalation logic is currently running on the hour
and the escalation triggers are fired every 15 minutes.
Now, say a case is created at 16:16 and the Escalation Rule is set to trigger after one hour.
The case will not be escalated until 17:30 because it missed the 17:15 escalation trigger by
one minute. This can be an issue when precise escalation is required, and hence by enabling
early triggers, this issue can be eliminated.
To enable early triggers in the escalation box, follow the path Setup | Customize | Cases |
Support Settings. Now click on Edit and set the Early Triggers Enabled checkbox, as
shown in the following screenshot, and then click on the Save button:

Salesforce Chatter
SalesforceChatter is an enterprise social networking application that helps users connect
with people and share business information. It can be accessed from the App Menu at the
top-right corner of the Salesforce CRM screen. Chatter feeds can also be accessed from
within the Salesforce CRM record pages. All users with a Salesforce license have access to
Chatter, and you can also create new users that do not have Salesforce licenses but wish to
have access to Chatter. These user licenses can access Chatter users, profiles, groups, and
files. However, they cannot access any Salesforce object data.
Chatter Only user licenses can be created for users within your company, known as Chatter
Free, as well as for employees not in your organization, such as customers, known as
Chatter External. These are shown in the following screenshot.
A further Chatter license (not shown in the previous screenshot of User License selection) is
the Chatter Only license. This license is also known as Chatter Plus and is for users that do
not have Salesforce licenses but require access to some Salesforce objects in addition to
Chatter. This provides access to Chatter users, profiles, groups, and files, in addition to the
viewing of Salesforce accounts and contacts and the ability to modify up to ten custom
objects.
You can upgrade a user's Chatter Free license to a standard Salesforce
license whenever you wish; however, you cannot change a standard
Salesforce license or Chatter Only license for a user to a Chatter Free
license.

As mentioned previously, Salesforce Chatter can be accessed from the App Menu by
selecting the SalesforceChatter option, within which the following tabs are available:
Chatter, Profile, People, Groups, and Files, as shown in the following screenshot:
These tabs are available by default in the Chatter app, however you can also add these tabs
to other apps if required.
Chatter's primary features
The following primary features exist in SalesforceChatter.
Feed
A Chatter feed is a list of recent activities in Salesforce that are displayed on:
The Chatter tab and Home tab. Here, users can see their posts, posts from people
they follow, updates to records they follow, and posts to groups they are a
member of.
Profiles, where users can see posts made by the person whose profile they are
viewing.
Records, where users can see updates to the record they are viewing.
Chatter groups, where users can see posts to the group they are viewing.
Post
A Chatter post is a top-level comment in a Chatter feed.

[ 469 ]
Invitations
As the name suggests, a Chatter invitation sends an invite by e-mail to co-workers (either
with or without a Salesforce license) or people outside your company (such as customers).
Chatter settings
Chatter settings provide options for feeds, posts, and invitations. We will first look at the
setting to enable Chatter, and then in the following sections we will look through the
various settings you can apply in SalesforceChatter.
Enabling Chatter
Enabling Chatter also enables the Classic 2010 interface theme, which updates the look and
feel of Salesforce.
Chatter is enabled by default for organizations created after June 22, 2010.
For existing organizations, you must enable Chatter, as shown shortly.
When Chatter is enabled, the global search, which allows searching across Salesforce,
including Chatter feeds, files, groups, and people is activated.
Where there are 15 or fewer users, all users automatically follow each
other when Chatter is enabled.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 470 ]
The selection of the Salesforce Chatter options can be carried out by following the path
Setup | Customize | Chatter | Chatter Settings, as shown in the following screenshot:
Let's look at each of the Salesforce Chatter setting options.
Chatter Settings – Enable Chatter
Check the Enable checkbox to turn on Chatter and the Global Search features.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 471 ]
Groups
This option allows you to modify Chatter group settings. By checking the Allow Group
Archiving you will allow automatic and manual archiving for groups.
Groups can be activated even if this feature is not enabled.
Rich link previews in feed
Check the Allow Rich Link Previews checkbox to display rich content in the Chatter feed.
By enabling this option, links in posts are converted into embedded videos, images, and
article previews.
The rich content is provided by Embed.ly, which is a third-party web
hosting service and previews are only available for links to supported
sites. Salesforce does not share any private content with Embed.ly, just the
URL.
Approval posts
Check the Allow Approvals checkbox to permit users to use Chatter posts within Salesforce
Workflow approval processing. By enabling this option, users can approve any business
process from within their Chatter feed.
Coworker Invitations
Check the Allow Coworker Invitations checkbox to enable everyone in your company to
access Chatter. This allows all colleagues, even those who do not have Salesforce licenses, to
collaborate using Salesforce Chatter.
Invited users can access Chatter users, profiles, groups, and files but cannot access
Salesforce records unless they have a Salesforce license. To make Chatter available for
company colleagues, you can either manually add Chatter users or use the Invitations
option.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 472 ]
Invitations are automatically turned on for new organizations, and the Company Email
Domains field is populated based on the first user's e-mail address.
Salesforce recommends that you do not enter public e-mail domains such
as hotmail.com or gmail.com. Anyone with an e-mail address in these
domains could then join and access Chatter features and data within your
organization.
You must provide at least one e-mail domain. You can add a maximum of 200 domains. The
domains that you enter should be those used in e-mail addresses within your company.
As security, the Allow Coworker Invitations checkbox will not be
activated if the domain is a free e-mail provider such as yahoo.com,
gmail.com, and so on.
Customer Invitations
Check the Allow Customer Invitations checkbox to permit users to invite people from
outside your company network.
File Sync
This option allows users to access files saved in their Salesforce Files folder on their
desktops from the Synced filter on the Files tab in Chatter, and in Salesforce1 Mobile (this
was covered in Chapter 10, Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM).
Your users need to install a desktop client called Salesforce Files. They can then securely
store, sync, and share files between Chatter, their desktops, and mobile devices.
These following limits apply when using the Salesforce Files Client: 10 GB
is the maximum amount of data that individual users can sync in their
Salesforce Files folder. Should the folder reach this limit, new files will not
sync until other files are deleted from the folder. 500 MB is the maximum
size of file that can be uploaded using the Salesforce Files folder.

Publisher Actions
Publisher Actions (or simply Actions) let you create actions and add them to the Chatter
publisher on the homepage, on the Chatter tab, in Chatter groups, and on record detail
pages. Actions also appear in the action tray in Salesforce1.
Actions can be set up to provide your users with the option to create or update records and
log calls directly in the Chatter feed or from the users' mobile devices. Actions can be
regular actions, such as create and update, or you can configure and develop custom
Actions based on your company's needs.
The following lists the various types of actions:
Standard actions that are automatically included when Chatter is enabled, such
as Post, File, Link, and Poll. Here, you can customize the order in which these
appear, but you cannot edit their properties.
Create actions allow users to create records. You can choose the fields used in
Create actions and when the record is saved any validation rule or mandatory
field is fired.
Log a call actions permit users to enter the details of phone calls where these call
logs are saved as completed tasks.
Send email actions (only available on Case records) provide a Case feed e-mail
action on Salesforce1 Mobile (albeit, at the time of writing, a simplified version of
the Case Feed Email function).
Update actions let users amend a record from the feed associated with the record.
Question actions let users ask and search for questions about the record.
Custom actions are extended functionality developed with Visualforce pages or
Canvas apps or Lightning Components.
Feed tracking
When you enable feed tracking, users will see updates for the objects and records that they
follow in their Chatter feed. Many objects and fields are tracked by default, but you can
further customize feed tracking to include or exclude specific objects and fields.

Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and the Collaborative Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 474 ]
You can set feed tracking for users, Chatter groups, and the following standard objects:
accounts, assets, campaigns, cases, contacts, contracts, dashboards, events, leads,
opportunities, products, reports, solutions, and tasks. You can also configure feed tracking
for custom objects.
The selection of the Salesforce Feed Tracking options can be carried out by following the
path Setup | Customize | Chatter | Feed Tracking, as shown in the following screenshot.
Chat settings
This feature allows users to chat with people they follow in Chatter without having to use
external chat clients.

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the functional areas within Salesforce CRM, where we
described the process from campaign to customer and beyond. We saw how leads in
Salesforce CRM can be converted to generate the accounts, contacts, and opportunity
records, which would then be processed through the sales cycle to form customer records,
and we also saw how these customers can be supported by the customer service and
support teams using the case management features.
Within the functional areas, we touched on when business teams concerned with
marketing, sales, and customer service have to agree on roles and responsibilities for
aspects of the business processes. We also looked at Salesforce Chatter, a collaboration
application that helps in this respect by connecting people and sharing business
information.

Finally, we posed some questions to help clarify some of the key features of Salesforce's
Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Chatter.
In the next chapter, we will look at the ways in which the Salesforce CRM platform can be
extended further through the use of customization technologies, such as Visualforce, where
you can leverage further benefits for your organization and enhance the system without the
need for expensive IT development resources.

Extending and Enhancing
Salesforce CRM
In this chapter, we will look at how to extend and enhance the functionality within the
Salesforce CRM application and how to move beyond the standard Salesforce Apps and
features that we have looked at so far.
We will look at how additional functionality can be added to your Salesforce environment
by using external applications from the AppExchange Marketplace to extend the capability
of the core Salesforce CRM platform.
An overview of the technologies and techniques that allow advanced customization will be
presented, which will help you gain an understanding of the features and considerations
required to create web mashups in your Salesforce CRM applications.
You will discover how, with the use of platforms and technologies such as Visualforce, you
can extend the core functionality of the application and leverage significant benefits for
your organization, as well as how to enhance the system without the need for expensive IT
development resources.

Salesforce AppExchange Marketplace
The Salesforce AppExchange Marketplace is a website provided by Salesforce.com that
enables organizations to select additional applications, known as Apps, to add new features
to their Salesforce CRM application
Both the Salesforce CRM application and the AppExchange provide web-delivered
platforms for using and building applications. This integrated web-delivered approach
allows for the installation of applications and new functionality from AppExchange into
Salesforce, which is often far simpler and more cost effective than traditional software
update mechanisms. The benefits of the AppExchange are that system administrators can
easily extend the Salesforce CRM application as your company's business requirements
change.
There is a wealth of solutions available to help achieve most requirements that you can
access from the Salesforce AppExchange Marketplace, and in this section we will describe
and take you through the process of installing an example app.
The apps and services listed on AppExchange are provided by the Salesforce community of
third-party developers and system integrators. Many of the apps are also provided by
Salesforce themselves through their team known as the Force.com Labs. The apps can range
from highly complex multiple screen solutions to simple sets of dashboards or reports.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 487 ]
Apps can sometimes incur additional costs, but there are many which are provided for free
or a small fee. In general, apps provided by the Salesforce.com Force.com Labs team tend to
be free. To access AppExchange, navigate to Setup |AppExchange Marketplace, as shown
in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 488 ]
You can also access the AppExchange Marketplace website directly by navigating to h t t p
://w w w . a p p e x c h a n g e . c o m /, as shown in the following screenshot:
As a directory, Salesforce AppExchange is similar to consumer websites, such as the App
Store from Apple, in the way that it seeks to provide an open, community-based channel for
the distribution, retrieval, and installation of applications.
AppExchange differs, however, in that it provides not only the facilities for the third-party
distribution of apps, but also the listing of services by system integrators. This enables the
Salesforce community to search for and review both apps and services from a central site.
Managed and unmanaged packages
Salesforce terms the collection of components and applications that are distributed through
AppExchange as a package. There are two main types of packages, namely, managed and
unmanaged.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 489 ]
Managed packages differ from unmanaged packages by the use of protected components
that allow the managed packages to be upgraded by the developers, allowing them to add
new functionality or to refactor in any changes in the Salesforce environment. By protecting
certain components such as Apex Code, managed packages also serve to protect the
intellectual property of the developer organization.
Unmanaged packages, on the other hand, do not protect components and are therefore
static within your organization, as they cannot be upgraded by the publishing developer.
They allow you to access all of the implemented customization or code and can be useful if
you want to change or extend the functionality yourself.
Users with the permission Download AppExchange Packages enabled for
their profile can install or uninstall the AppExchange packages from the
AppExchange website.
Sometimes apps are distributed by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), which use the
AppExchange package as a channel to advertise their presence and to showcase their range
of products.
External and third-party tools
By showcasing on the AppExchange Marketplace website, ISVs often provide free apps,
which help drive traffic and interest in their core products that complement Salesforce
CRM, and they are usually provided as web-based solutions in the same way as Salesforce.
These complementary applications are typically deployed alongside Salesforce CRM in
support of a specific business process or function. For example, incentive and commission
management, project management, product configuration, expense management, address
checking, and so on, are all examples of apps for Salesforce that are available from
AppExchange.
App security
Salesforce inspects all registered apps to be sure that they have no obvious security risks.
However, it is worth noting that since the apps are developed by third-party providers, you
should also carry out extensive testing and employ due diligence to eliminate any risk
before installing the app into your production instance.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 490 ]
After an app has passed the Salesforce inspection, the core functionality and code can no
longer be changed. However, custom links and web tabs are allowed to be changed because
they may need to be altered after installation, for example, simple target URLs might need
to be changed from one organization to another.
You need to be aware how these links may introduce risks as part of your decision whether
to trust the source of an app before installing it to production. This is described in more
detail in the following section.
Before installing an app
The following steps are recommended to help you understand more about the app and to
determine any risk or need for further setup in your organization before you actually install
the app into your production instance:
Read the specifications and reviews.
1.
Review the screenshots and customization guides.
2.
Take a test drive.
3.
Reading specifications and reviews
Before installing, read the specification associated with the app, where you will see the
following details: which Salesforce editions are supported, what languages are supported,
the components summary, and package details.
It is often also worth looking at the reviews that have been left by others that have
attempted to install the app. Although there is no guarantee that the review is 100%
accurate, and it may be subjective, it can give you an indication of the complexity in the use
and successful installation of an app by other system administrators.
Reviewing screenshots and customization guides
Most apps that have been listed on the AppExchange website provide screenshots and
guides for any post-install customization that may be required. These are useful and
provide a quick indicator of whether the app will be of use to you and your organization.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 491 ]
Taking a test drive
Apps typically offer a test drive option (especially the more complex apps), where you are
directed to an external Salesforce application where you can use the app as a read-only user
before installation. A test drive gives you a far better way of determining whether the app is
suitable for your organization before installing.
Within the test drive, you have the opportunity to check the app and its components to
ensure that they are suitable, and also that they pose no security risks. For example,
components such as custom links, formula fields, and web tabs can send Salesforce session
IDs to external web services.
Session IDs are tokens that allow users to access Salesforce CRM without
re-entering the login name and password.
Salesforce.com recommends checking all links to external services that include a session
ID merge field, because if these session IDs are shared with an external service, then
they can expose your data, potentially leading to a significant security risk that we need to
be aware of.
Installing an app
The following steps describe the process of how to install an app into your Salesforce CRM
application from the AppExchange Marketplace:
Click the Get It Now button.
1.
Examine the package.
2.
Review the security.
3.
Install the app.
4.
Perform the post-installation configuration.
5.
The best way to guide you through the use of new technology is by demonstrating with an
example.

Here, we are going to install an application calledMass Delete, which has been developed
and published by Salesforce.com's Force.com Labs team. This is a free app that provides a
set of custom buttons that allow users to select any number of records and then delete them
with a single click.
The Mass Delete app from Salesforce.com's Force.com Labs is available

Salesforce production URL, which may be h t t p s ://l o g i n . s a l e s f o r c e . c o m . If you want to
install it into a sandbox org, you must change the login URL to that of the sandbox, which is
https://test.salesforce.com, and use your sandbox login details.
Now enter your User Name andPassword and then click on Login to proceed to the next
screen:
In this screen you are presented with options of how to handle a situation when an existing
component's name conflicts with a component being installed. Here, the options available
are Do not install and Rename conflicting components in package. You are also presented
with options for the users' profile permissions that will be applied when the app is installed.

Now click on the Install button to proceed with the installation, and when complete the
following confirmation screen appears:
In this final screen you are presented with information about the App Name, Publisher,
Version Name, and various other details that make up the app package.
This screen provides confirmation that the app package has been successfully installed.
For large and complex apps, you may not see the Installation Complete Confirmation
screen straight away. Instead, a screen is sometimes displayed that shows a message that
the installation has been scheduled, and you will then later receive an e-mail notification
when the deployment is complete.

Post-install configuration
Included in the package components of this Mass Delete app is a PDF guide describing the
post-installation configuration that must be applied to the app before the functionality can
be used. The guide can be accessed from within the Documents tab (which is accessible
from the main Documents tab), as shown in the following screenshot:

Using the guide, we add the Custom list button to the Contacts-related list within the
Accounts detail page, as shown in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 502 ]
Finally, to verify the installation and customization, we can navigate to the Accounts detail
page and access the Contacts related list section, whereupon we can access the Mass Delete
custom button and associated functionality:
In Salesforce CRM Unlimited Edition, you can install an unlimited number
of apps. In the Enterprise Edition, there is a maximum limit of ten apps.
Uninstalling an app
You can uninstall an app that has been installed from the AppExchange; however, there are
some considerations. If you uninstall a package that includes a custom object, all
components associated with that custom object are deleted, such as custom fields,
validation rules, workflow rules, approval processes, custom buttons and links, and so on.
You cannot uninstall a package if any component in the package is
referenced by a component that will not be included in the uninstall, or if a
field added by the package is being updated by a scheduled job, such as a
time-based workflow field update (here, you must wait until the
background job finishes and retry).

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 503 ]
After an uninstall, Salesforce automatically creates an export file containing the package
data. When the uninstall is complete, Salesforce sends an e-mail containing a link to the
admin user carrying out the uninstall.
The export files (plus related notes and attachments) are listed below the list of installed
packages.
Salesforce recommends backing up and storing the export file elsewhere
because it will only be available for a limited period after the uninstall.To
uninstall an AppExchange app, navigate to Setup | Installed Packages, as
shown in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM

Now select the installed package and either click on the Uninstall, or click on the package
name to review the details of the package, set the uninstall confirmation checkbox, and
finally click on the Uninstall button, as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 505 ]
AppExchange best practices
The following best practices should be applied when installing apps from the AppExchange
Marketplace website:
Clarify that the specification for the app meets the requirements and assess any
reviews and comments
Take a test drive, if available
Review all the components that are included in the package and be aware of any
security issues concerning links and session IDs
Test the app in a sandbox before deploying into production
Try to enlist business support to own and validate the app before deploying into
production
Consider undertaking a pilot deployment for selected users if the app is
particularly complex
Communicate the app to the business prior to deployment and activation in
production
Prepare training material for all affected users if the app is particularly complex
Enterprise mashups in web applications
A mashup is a general term that is commonly used to describe the merging of functionality
and content from multiple sources. It is typically applied to describe the merging of web 
applications where the sources may often be using different technology to provide the
service or application. As part of the distinction of a web application mashup, there is a
common feature that provides connectivity, which is the Internet.
The connections between the various sources may require different levels and complexities
of integration, depending on whether the associated information or content is to be simply
viewed or whether it is also to be amended, and therefore whether data is to be distributed
across various systems. When mashups first started appearing on the Web, they were
created to enable the viewing of content from another web source within an Internet
browser, and did not transfer any data or functionality between the source systems.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 506 ]
An example of such a mashup is a website that displays a how to find us type of page within
one of its web pages, such as the contact page. Within the HTML code, there might be an
embedded piece of functionality showing a static Google Map or a similar web control, as
shown in the following screenshot:
This type of mashup is an example of a simple client-side mashup, where the connectivity
occurs inside the web browser. This coding inside the web page provides a way to combine
static information from multiple Internet sources and generate an elegant visual
presentation.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 507 ]
As mashups have evolved, far more complex functionality can now be achieved. It is
possible to have sophisticated integration between web applications where information and
functionality are seamlessly shared. As you might expect, this requires more complex
coding to achieve, and also may require the use of server-side infrastructures. We will look
at the distinction between client-side and server-side mashups shortly.
Mashups in Salesforce CRM
It may seem daunting at first, especially if you are less familiar with Internet scripting
technologies such as HTML, but certain types of mashups can be accomplished by most
people and do not require professional software developers or an IT team.
HTML is the main markup language for creating web pages and other
information that can be displayed in a web browser (h t t p s ://e n . w i k i p e d
i a . o r g /w i k i /H T M L ).
Before starting out, it is always useful to first evaluate how and where the mashup needs to
be done, and in particular, the type of data and service that is to be mashed up. Once this is
understood, you can then begin to consider the coding effort and plan the resources
required to implement them.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 508 ]
To understand the flavor of mashups as far as Salesforce CRM is concerned, and as
suggested, at a high-level, there are two main categories of mashup development, and these
can be classed as either server-side or client-side, as shown in the following diagram:
Looking at the previous diagram, we see that the server-side mashup goes through the
following high-level steps:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 509 ]
User makes a page request to Salesforce CRM using their web browser.
1.
The web browser calls the Salesforce CRM servers, which invoke custom Apex

code.
The custom Apex code in Salesforce CRM calls a function on an external

application server.
The external application returns the response to Salesforce CRM.
4.
Salesforce CRM processes the response and returns the details to the user's web
5.
browser.
The user's web browser finally presents the overall response back to the user.
6.
Client-side mashups are far more simple, as they use the browser to link the requests and
responses required for the mashup, where the following typical high-level steps can be
considered:
User makes a page request to Salesforce CRM using their web browser.
1.
The user's web browser requests details from Salesforce CRM.
2.
Salesforce CRM returns the response to the user's web browser.
3.
The user's web browser requests details from the external application.
4.
The external application returns the response to the user's web browser.
5.
The user's web browser finally presents the overall response back to the user.
6.
As indicated, server-side mashups often require sophisticated coding and require external
infrastructure, which is generally provided by IT resources. As this book does not aim to be
a resource for developers, we will look at server-side technology at a high level, but we will
not go into the details.
We will, however, cover the use cases and provide some step-by-step instructions on how
you can compose client-side mashups, as well as the tools that are available within your
Salesforce CRM application.
Server-side mashups
By way of introduction, and for the sake of completeness, the following section describes
the core features of external server-side mashups. We will briefly look at, in a little more
detail, the capabilities, features, and implications associated with the use of server-side
mashups.
Server-side mashups are a specific example of an external services mashup. This is where
external systems may either serve the request for data from Salesforce as a client or use data
presented by Salesforce and mash the composite data in an external system.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 510 ]
These mashups typically use web services, and are most often provided by organizations
using web APIs, which describe how the service can be accessed by a client application over
the Internet and which are executed on the remote system that is hosting the service.
A more formal definition of a web service is provided by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C), which as detailed on their web page (h t t p ://w w w . w 3. o r g ), is an international
community where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to
develop web standards.
The definition of a web service by the W3C is as follows (h t t p ://w w w . w 3. o r g /T R /w s - g l o s s
/):
A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction
over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL).
Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP-
messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other
Web-related standards.
Although the web service definition for the machine-to-machine interaction by the W3C
refers to machine-to-machine interaction using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP),
there is another protocol that is becoming increasingly popular today, known as
Representational State Transfer (REST). This is mentioned for information only, and we
will not go into any further detail about web services in this book.
Client-side mashups
Within Salesforce CRM, there are typically two types of client-side mashup, namely, client-
side services mashups and client-side presentation mashups.
Client-side services mashups
Similar to server-side mashups, client-side services mashups can also be used to call web
services or consume websites and feeds. They can be used to invoke the Salesforce CRM
web services API from within the browser. Client-side services mashups require more
complex programming than client-side presentation mashups, and typically rely on the
technologies associated with web services.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 511 ]
Client services mashups and external services mashups are useful to organizations that
need to access information from various systems that usually serve a business data process
and interact in real time. Specifying and developing these types of mashups needs to be
carefully evaluated to determine the required effort and resources.
Client-side presentation mashups
Client-side presentation mashups are the least complex mashups and can be composed
relatively quickly. Here, live data and functionality from multiple sources are embedded on
a web page that requires data from the Salesforce platform with which to mashup with the
non-Salesforce data and functionality.
Client presentation mashups in Salesforce can be composed using Visualforce, HTML, and
JavaScript, and which can often be copied and pasted by nontechnical users, immediately
adding value to a web application.
Having briefly outlined the nature of client-side mashups, we are now going to look at how
they can actually be created in Salesforce CRM. As shown earlier, the enabling technology is
provided by the Salesforce platform with the use of the web page framework known as
Visualforce.
The best way to guide you through the use of new technology is by demonstrating how to
use it with an example. Here, we are going to compose a client-side presentation that
displays a Google Map widget displaying Google Map location details for a given company
record in Salesforce.
The Google Map will be presented to the user in Salesforce CRM after selecting an
appropriate account record, and live Google Map information will be displayed right from
within the relevant account detail page. The mashup will be composed by creating a new
Visualforce page with the required Google Map widget and then adding a new section to
the account detail page where the Visualforce page will be included.
Introduction to Visualforce
Visualforce is the framework in Salesforce CRM that allows you to further customize your
organization's user interface beyond the standard functionality we have previously
covered.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 512 ]
As described previously, using Visualforce you can combine data from multiple objects,
create mashups with data from external web services, and even override some of the logic
and the behavior found within standard Salesforce CRM application functions. Visualforce
consists of the following three elements:
Visualforce pages: These are used to define the user interface
Visualforce components: These can be thought of as a library of standard or
custom-built sections of Visualforce code
Visualforce page controllers: These are used to control the behavior of Visualforce
pages, and can either be controlled by standard logic or you can create custom
logic to change or extend the standard Salesforce CRM behavior
Visualforce pages
The Visualforce framework allows for the creation of Visualforce pages. These pages are a
little like documents that are stored in Salesforce, and they are comprised of instructions
that specify how the page is to appear and function. Similar in nature to HTML, Visualforce
pages comprise of a tag-based markup language, with each Visualforce tag type
corresponding to a particular user interface component.
The maximum size of a Visualforce page cannot be greater than 15 MB.
For the more technical readers, Visualforce performs similar functions as, say, Java Server
Pages or Active Server Pages and is used to manage the retrieval of data from the Salesforce
platform and the rendering of results via the Internet browser user interface.
Creating a Visualforce page
Now that you are aware of the basic building blocks provided by Visualforce, we will
describe the creation of Visualforce pages. This section looks at how the creation and
modification of pages can be done and shows the following two ways of doing so:
Using the Visualforce pages setup page
Using development mode

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 513 ]
Visualforce pages setup page
To navigate to the setup page for creating Visualforce pages, go to Setup | Develop |
Pages. Now click on the New button to create a new Visualforce page. Select an existing
entry to view the page or click on Edit to modify it, as shown in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 514 ]
Visualforce development mode
We can also use something called Visualforce development mode to initially create and edit
Visualforce pages. This can be a better choice because it provides several useful features
that make it easier to build Visualforce pages.
To start using the development mode, it needs to be activated on your user record by
navigating to Your Name | Setup | My Personal Information | Personal Information.
Now click on the Edit button, select the Development Mode checkbox (as shown in the
following screenshot), and then finally click on Save:
When in Visualforce development mode, you can create a new page simply by entering a
unique URL into the browser's address bar.
Automatic creation of new Visualforce pages can be done by entering a unique URL (for a
Visualforce page that does not exist) into the browser's address bar. For example, typing the
URL https://na10.salesforce.com/apex/GoogleMap will enable a new page called Google
Map to be created.
You need to be careful that you are entering the correct URL text, as it is the
/apex/GoogleMap part in the preceding example that prompts Salesforce CRM to check
and create a new page if it does not currently exist. It is also important that the start of the
URL is entered correctly. The h t t p s ://n a 10. s a l e s f o r c e . c o m   part refers to the Salesforce
instance for your Salesforce CRM application.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 515 ]
When entered correctly, the following screen, which allows you to create the Visualforce page, will be
presented:
This, as you can appreciate, can save a lot of time when creating multiple pages, as you do
not need to keep navigating to the setup section, saving you a number of mouse clicks.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 516 ]
The resulting edit page when you click on the Create Page Google Map link is the same
edit page as when accessed through the setup route, as shown in the following screenshot:
When development mode is enabled, a development section is automatically presented
below the Visualforce page that you are creating or editing, which displays an editor
section. To show or hide the development section, click on the following icon:
The editor allows you to write Visualforce component tags directly within the browser
window and also offers the following features:
As shown, the seven menu functions are provided for:
Saving the page
Searching for text
Navigating to a specified line in the code

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 517 ]
Undoing changes
Redoing changes
Increasing the font size of the text
Decreasing the font size of the text
Clicking on the Component Reference link will take you to online documentation, which
provides descriptions as well as example code for all the Visualforce components, as shown
in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 518 ]
 
In addition, the page editor also provides highlighting and an autocomplete feature that
automatically displays available component markup tags, as shown in the following
screenshot:
The greatest benefit of having development mode enabled when building Visualforce pages
using the Salesforce CRM platform is that as you add component tags and build up the
code in the page, you can click on the save icon and view the resulting changes
immediately.
The Visualforce page must be free from errors before the page can be
saved.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 519 ]
Visualforce components
We have seen in the previous section that Salesforce provides a set of standard, pre-built
components, such as <apex:actionFunction> and <apex:actionStatus>, which can be
added to Visualforce pages to construct pages of functionality. In addition, you can build
your own custom components to augment this library of components.
Similar to the way functions work in a programming language, a custom Visualforce
component allows you to construct common code and then re-use that code in one or more
Visualforce pages.
Custom components allow you to define attributes that can be passed to each component.
The value of an attribute can then change the way the markup is displayed on the final page
and the controller-based logic that executes for that instance of the component.
Visualforce custom components consist of Visualforce markup tags using the standard
<apex:component> tag, and so rather than repeating the Visualforce markup required for
every page that you need the common code on, you can define a custom component that
has certain attributes and then uses those attributes to display the functionality on the page.
Once defined, every Visualforce page in your organization can leverage the custom
component in the same way as a page can leverage standard components such as
<apex:dataTable> or <apex:actionStatus>.
Creating an example mashup with Visualforce
To construct our example mashup we will follow these steps:
Delete the default new Visualforce markup content.
1.
Change the Visualforce Controller to specify an Account Standard Controller.
2.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 520 ]
Copy and paste the Google Map code and add Salesforce-specific merge fields.
Deleting the default new Visualforce markup content
Delete the existing Visualforce page text (lines 2 to 5 in the following screenshot) and leave
just the starting and ending tags, <apex:page> and </apex:page>, as shown in the
following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 521 ]
Changing the Visualforce Controller to specify an
Account Standard Controller
We also need to change the Visualforce page controller so that we can read the value of the
fields stored on the Account record. Controllers will be looked at in more detail later on in
this chapter, but for the moment we will change the opening tag <apex:page> and add the 
standard Controller attribute, which allows the call to the Account record, as shown
using the code <apex:page standard Controller="account">:
Copy and paste the Google Map code and add Salesforce-specific merge fields.
We will copy and paste the following code, which contains Salesforce merge fields, to
render a Google Map on our account records:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.google.com
    /maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    function initialize()
    {
      var map;
      var mapOptions =
      {
        zoom: 13,
        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP,
        mapTypeControl: false
      }
      var mapMarker;
      var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
      var address =
       "{!SUBSTITUTE(JSENCODE(Account.BillingStreet),'\r\n','
       ')}, " + "{!Account.BillingCity}, " +
       "{!Account.BillingPostalCode}, " +
       "{!Account.BillingCountry}";geocoder.geocode( {address:
       address}, function(results, status)
       { if(status ==
         google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK && results.length)
         { if(status !=
         google.maps.GeocoderStatus.ZERO_RESULTS)

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 522 ]
           {
              map = new
              google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"),
              mapOptions);
              map.setCenter(results[0].geometry.location);
              mapMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
                position: results[0].geometry.location,
                map: map,
                title: "{!Account.Name} " + address
              });
            }
          } else {
            document.getElementById("map").innerHTML = "Unable to find or
display a map
            for {!Account.Name}'s billing address : " + address;
          }
       });
     }
</script>
  <div id="map" style="width:100%;height:300px"></div>
<script>
  initialize();
</script>
We use Salesforce merge fields for the Account record to pass the Billing Address data to
the Google map API, as shown in the following snippet:
var address = "{!SUBSTITUTE(JSENCODE(Account.BillingStreet),'\r\n',' ')}, "
+ "{!Account.BillingCity}, " + "{!Account.BillingPostalCode}, " +
"{!Account.BillingCountry}";

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 523 ]
The final code will appear within the Visualforce page, as in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 524 ]
When saving the Visualforce page, the page is rendered immediately. However, at this
point, there is no billing address data that can be passed to the Google Map widget (this will
be rendered properly after we have added the Visualforce page to the Account Page
Layout), and therefore an error will initially be presented, as shown in the following
screenshot:
Notice how with the use of the <apex:page
standardController="account"> tag, the Accounts tab is now
automatically highlighted.
Adding the Visualforce page to the Account page layout
Now that we have completed and saved the Visualforce page, we can add the Google Map
page to the Account page layout. To add Visualforce pages to Accounts, navigate to Setup
|Customize | Accounts | Page Layouts. Now select the appropriate page layout. Here, we
are going to add it to the page layout called Account Layout by carrying out the steps
discussed in the following section.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 525 ]
Adding a new section to the Account page layout
The new section has been given the title Google Map and has been set to 1-Column width
and positioned by dragging and dropping below the Account System and Description
Information section, as shown in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 526 ]
Adding the Visualforce page to the new page layout
section
Now drag and drop the Google Map Visualforce page to the Google Map section on the
page layout, as shown in the following screenshot:
Now click on Save; we are ready to test by navigating to an account page.
Running the completed Visualforce page
Navigate to the Account tab and select an existing account to verify that the mashup is
working as expected.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 527 ]
You will need to ensure a Billing Address is completed for the account
record. The Billing Address composite field is a standard Account field in
Salesforce CRM.
Here we have an existing account for Salesforce.com with the Billing Address populated
and which displays a Google Map when the account detail page is loaded, as shown in the
following screenshot:
How do I suppress browser security warnings in Internet Explorer?

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 528 ]
By default, Internet Explorer displays the following security warning
message when a page contains a mixture of secure (HTTPS) and nonsecure
(HTTP) content: This page contains both secure and nonsecure items. Do
you want to display the nonsecure items? When you create a mashup
with a nonsecure URL, users may see this warning message depending on
their browser security settings. To suppress this warning in Internet
Explorer, follow these steps: from the Internet Explorer tools menu, select
Internet Options, click on the Security tab, click on the Custom Level
button and, finally, in the miscellaneous section, set Display mixed
content to Enable, as shown in the following screenshot:

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 529 ]
Visualforce page controllers
As described earlier in this chapter, there are four types of controllers that can be used to
control the functionality behind a Visualforce page.
Standard controllers
A standard controller provides access to standard Salesforce CRM behavior and, as shown
in our example client-side mashup, can be specified using the following tag and attribute as
the first line in the Visualforce page:
<apex:page standardController="Account">
Standard controllers are available for standard objects, such as Account, Contact,
Opportunity, and so on, as well as custom objects, and they provide access to standard
Salesforce CRM data operations and behavior for actions such as save, edit, and delete.
Custom controllers
Custom controllers are used for fully customized behavior and are implemented using the
Visualforce tag and attribute as follows:
<apex:page controller="CustomAccount">

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 530 ]
Controller extensions
Controller extensions are used to extend the behavior of standard controllers and allow the
addition of customized functionality. Controller extensions are provided using the
Visualforce tag and attribute as follows:
<apex:page standardController="Account"
extensions="CustomAccountExtension">
Standard list controllers
Salesforce record pages allow users to filter the records displayed on the page using list
views (covered in Chapter 3, Configuring Objects and Apps). For example, on the accounts
home page, users can choose to view a list of only the accounts they own by selecting My
Accounts from the list view drop-down menu.
Standard list controllers provide the same list view picklist and are implemented using the
following tag and attribute as the first line in the Visualforce page:
<apex:page standardController="Account" recordSetVar="accounts">
Apex code
The Apex code language in Salesforce CRM is based on Java, which is one of the most
popular programming languages for Internet and web-based applications, and is executed
on the Salesforce platform servers.
Although based on Java, the Apex code and the Salesforce CRM platform is not a general-
purpose computing platform that can be used to run any type of program that developers
may choose to run. Instead, Apex is kept intentionally controlled and limited and is,
therefore, designed with the needs of the business and platform in mind.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 531 ]
Apex code in Salesforce is not intended to solve every programming
problem and is instead concerned principally with helping developers
gain advantages in development time, code conciseness, and reduction in
maintenance costs.
Apex is used in Salesforce CRM to develop the code within Custom controllers and
Controller extensions, as well as Apex triggers, which we will look at shortly.
Apex is specifically designed for building business applications to manage data and
services, and the language provides a highly productive approach to creating applications
and business logic. Developers can focus on the functionality required to solve the business
problem and domain and need not be concerned with building the infrastructures, such as
database connection, error handling, and so on, which is instead managed by the platform.
It should be noted that since the Salesforce CRM platform is a multi-tenant platform, there
are certain limits as to what and how much processing can be performed within certain
operations. Such limits are known, such as Governor Limits, and there are some restrictions
and requirements – for example, Apex code must be developed in a developer or sandbox
organization and must have test methods to verify each line of code. Only then is it allowed
to be deployed to production.
For successful deployment to production, Apex code must have associated
unit test methods that provide at least 75% successful code coverage.
Apex triggers
Apex triggers are blocks of Apex code that are executed before and/or after any record
action such as create, update, or delete in the Salesforce CRM application.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 532 ]
Triggers are very powerful and can include complex code for controlling your process.
They are used for complex business logic automation and where such functionality is too
complicated to be implemented using validation rules or workflow rules, such as field
updates. The development of Apex triggers usually requires the resource of a software
developer, as they have certain restrictions and implications for the overall system.
When using multiple triggers, and alongside any existing workflow field updates, there
needs to be a thorough understanding of any dependencies so as to avoid any ripple effect
when records are created or updated. As trigger code can make changes to the record being
updated within its own operation, any likely recursion effect needs to be understood and
avoided.
Apex triggers offer many benefits to an organization, but they also
introduce some risks as there needs to be awareness of certain patterns
and limits (bulkifying triggers, governors, and so on.) imposed by the
underlying platform. It is particularly important to understand the timing,
order of execution, and dependencies of the various rules and triggers
within an organization.
Change management overview
As outlined in the section on installing apps from AppExchange Marketplace, you should
properly evaluate the functionality and results of deploying an app within your Salesforce
CRM organization. This concept is part of a wider concern, which addresses the way
changes are applied to the Salesforce CRM application.
With the use of Salesforce sandboxes, you can properly evaluate and perform due diligence
for new Salesforce functionality before deciding to roll it out to your users in the production
system. In the case of an AppExchange app, if the app proves to be unsuccessful, then it
need not be uninstalled.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 533 ]
Salesforce sandboxes
Sandboxes are separate Salesforce CRM environments that are isolated from your Salesforce
production organization, so actions that you carry out in your sandboxes do not affect your
Salesforce production environment, and vice versa.
To view and manage your existing sandboxes or create new ones in Salesforce CRM,
navigate to Setup | Sandboxes.
You can view the list of any existing sandboxes that have been created, and clicking on a
sandbox name allows you to view details about the sandbox, such as when it was created.
In the Sandbox List, you can see the Name, Type, Status, Location, Current Org Id,
Completed On, and Description Sandboxes where there are the following types:
Developer, Developer Pro, Partial Data, and Full, as shown in the following screenshot:
Sandbox availability is dependent on your edition of Salesforce CRM.
Some types are provided as standard while others are available for
additional cost.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 534 ]
Developer sandbox
A Developer sandbox is intended to be used for coding and testing and contains a copy of
all the configuration setup from your production system. It does not, however, contain any
of the data. There is a maximum of 200 MB of data storage and 200 MB of file storage that
can be created. The Developer sandbox can be refreshed once per day.
Developer Pro sandbox
A Developer Pro sandbox is intended to be used for coding, testing, and user training and
contains a copy of all the configuration setup from your production system. It does not,
however, contain any of the data. There is a maximum of 1 GB of data storage and 1 GB of
file storage that can be created. The Developer Pro sandbox can be refreshed once per day.
Partial Copy sandbox
A Partial Copy sandbox is intended to be used as a testing environment and contains a copy
of your production organization's configuration setup. Unlike the Developer and
Developer Pro sandboxes, a Partial Copy sandbox permits a sample of your production
organization's data that you define by using a sandbox template.
To create a Partial Copy sandbox, you must apply a sandbox template at creation time,
although there is a maximum of 5 GB of data storage and 5 GB of file storage that can be
stored. For each selected object in the sandbox template, up to 10,000 records are brought
over from the production environment. For example, if you have a template that includes
only accounts to create a Partial Copy sandbox, up to 10,000 Account records will be copied
into the new sandbox – no other records. Unlike the Developer and Developer Pro
sandboxes, the Partial Copy sandbox can only be refreshed once every five days.
Full Copy sandbox
A Full Copy sandbox contains a copy of your entire production setup, including all the
data. Because the data is also copied over during a refresh, there is a limit of refreshing the
Full Copy sandbox to once every 29 days. Full Copy sandboxes have the same storage limit
as the production organization.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 535 ]
The Full Copy sandbox is generally used for User Acceptance Testing
(UAT).
Clicking on the New Sandbox button allows you to create a new sandbox.
The Sandbox Templates tab is used with Partial Copy sandboxes and determines the types
of record and data that is to be copied over from the production environment.
The Sandbox History tab allows you to see the sandbox refresh history, showing when
sandboxes were created and who created them.
The Refresh link allows you to replace an existing sandbox with a new copy. The existing
copy of the sandbox remains available while the refresh completes and until you activate
the new copy.
When creating or refreshing a Full sandbox, you can reduce the time taken for the refresh
by reducing the amount of data that is copied. The following options allow you to reduce
the amount of data that is copied:
The Case History option allows you to select the number of days of case history
from your production organization to copy to your sandbox. You can copy from 0
to 180 days in 30-day increments. The default value is 30 days.
The Opportunity History option allows you to select the number of days of
opportunity history from your production organization to copy to your sandbox.
Here, you can copy from 0 to 180 days in 30-day increments. The default value is
0 days.
By default, Chatter data is not copied to your sandbox. Chatter data
includes feeds, messages, and discovery topics. Select the Copy Chatter
Data checkbox if you wish to copy it. Salesforce does not recommend
increasing the default selections as too much data can cause delays in the
time it takes to copy or refresh the sandbox. The Refresh option is only
shown for each sandbox that is available for refreshing.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 536 ]
An Activate link allows you to activate a refreshed sandbox, which must be done
before you can start using the new sandbox.
The Activate option is only displayed for refreshed sandboxes that have
yet to be activated.
Activating a refreshed sandbox replaces the existing sandbox with the refreshed
version and permanently deletes the old version and any data in it.
The Login option allows you to log in to a sandbox.
The Login button is only displayed for system administrators and may not
always be available. Users can log in to an active sandbox by using the
following URL: h t t p s ://t e s t . s a l e s f o r c e . c o m   and entering a modified
username, which is <username> from production, with a suffix for the
name of the sandbox. So, for a sandbox called Test, it would be
martin.brown@widgetsXYZ.com.test.
Sandboxes that no one has logged in to for 180 days are deleted. Users who have created or
most recently refreshed any sandbox within your organization will be notified that the
sandbox is scheduled for deletion. These users will receive at least three e-mail notifications
over 30 days prior to the deletion.
Salesforce recommends keeping a sandbox active by logging in
periodically to avoid e-mail notifications.
By using a sandbox, you can ensure that changes are deployed in a structured and
controlled manner and any change can be undone easily. This is known as change
management.

[ 537 ]
Effective change management reduces the risk when introducing new areas of functionality
and when making changes to existing functionality. It obviously depends on the amount
and complexity of the planned change, but for a risk-free and successful implementation of
changes in Salesforce CRM, there needs to be a change management strategy, which
typically covers the following steps:
Changing requests.
1.
Configuring, developing, and deploying.
2.
Change requests
When working with a change management process in an organization, change requests are
typically gathered from ideas and requests from management and application users.
Case management for change requests
One method of gathering and storing change requests is by utilizing the
case management features within Salesforce CRM itself. This feature can
be set up to enable users to enter their required changes directly. You can
even consider building an approval process so that the change is approved
by the user's manager before being considered in any release cycle.
However, before the change requests are captured, you need a process to analyze and
prioritize the lists of requests and assess the scope of the work required. It can be useful to
classify the changes that are requested for inclusion in either an immediate, minor, or a
major release.
Immediate release
Change items that are suitable for immediate release are very small changes that can be
quickly implemented; they carry no risk and can be made directly into the production
environment. Changes such as new dashboards or reports, or modifications to existing
dashboards and reports, and field positioning on page layouts and related lists are
considered small changes. This category of release also includes simple data changes, such
as data imports and exports.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 538 ]
Changes can be configured, tested, and deployed with minimal impact, and therefore these
changes do not usually need to go through the change control process.
It is worth considering, however, how the changes are applied in any
other sandbox such as a developer, user acceptance, or test environment to
ensure that all the sandbox environments are kept in sync.
Minor release
Minor releases are for larger changes that can be grouped and scheduled for change
perhaps every 30 or 60 days. The types of changes that fall into this category include new
fields, new page layouts, new custom objects, and so on, which are more complicated than
the immediate release change items.
Minor release change items are medium level changes that can be implemented with minor
impact to the production environment and typically require less than a day of additional
training for users and overall less than a week of customization or code changes.
It is worth considering, however, how the changes are applied in any
other sandbox such as a Developer, User acceptance, or Test environment
to ensure that all the sandbox environments are kept in sync.
Major release
Major releases are large changes that will carry risk and have a major impact to the business
or environment. These changes are the ones that require modification to the user interface,
to the way data is updated, data migrations, and any integration projects. These types of
changes include new or modified role hierarchies, profiles, page layouts, record types, sales
and support processes, workflow and approvals, and custom code. These changes can be
introduced with the introduction of new AppExchange apps, process-impacting
configuration changes, data migrations, and integration

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 539 ]
Major release change items carry a high level of risk and are obviously
more complicated than a minor release change. These changes may
require additional time for training users, and in general require more
than a week of customization or code changes.
Configuring, developing, and deploying
Typical compliance requirements for change management are that changes are
appropriately tested and validated and that only approved changes are deployed into
production.
Configuration, development, and testing should always typically be carried out using a
sandbox environment, and a record should be maintained to record the successful testing,
validation, and approval of any changes prior to deployment or production. Depending
upon the scope and scale of the change request, as described previously, you may need to
consider using a different environment for development and testing.
A complex change often sees the need for a developer sandbox and separate testing
sandbox. When the changes are finished in the developer sandbox, they are migrated to the
testing sandbox, and only when approved are they deployed into the production
environment.
Only after appropriate review and agreement by the approval authority can the changes
ever be deployed into the production environment.
User adoption
In Chapter 8, Introducing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Collaborative Features of Salesforce
CRM, we looked at the core functionality that Salesforce CRM provides and also at how the
complete sales process, from campaign and lead capture right through to customer service
and support, can be captured. Here, we looked in detail at how Salesforce provides the
facilities to obtain a full 360-degree view of customer's past, present, and future
relationships within our organization.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 540 ]
We looked at how this information enables marketing to measure the return on investment
for marketing campaigns, sales to optimize the sales pipeline and sell more to each
customer, support to track customer support incidents, and requests to ensure that each one
is resolved appropriately and in a timely fashion.
Having this process in place is one thing, but to ensure that the information is captured to
support the process is another issue altogether. After all, processes and technologies are
only as good as the people who use them. So, it is vital that users are regularly logging in,
creating, and updating information into Salesforce CRM.
CRM technology, therefore, must be easy to use, accessible, and scalable to ensure that the
efforts of using the system provide significant enhancements in productivity, efficiency, and
information accessibility. Once the business goals have been established and can be
measured, organizations generally need to address methods of ensuring or increasing user
adoption. Here, you can cultivate active product advocates or evangelists from within your
business to support certain initiatives for any relevant areas of the business.
A significant factor for successful adoption is to give users incentives to use the system by
providing them with functionality that improves the way they work and offers valuable
information and tools not available elsewhere within the organization.
Another important consideration is to encourage feedback from the user community. By
encouraging feedback and instilling a sense of collaboration, a collective ownership for
Salesforce CRM can be obtained that will instill trust. Responding to good suggestions,
customizing, and communicating enhancements to the application can lead to better
acceptance of changes, and makes people more likely to want to spend their time working
with the application.
In spite of the positives mentioned, user adoption cannot be assumed or taken for granted,
and your company might need to consider reinforcing adoption with rules as well as
rewards.
User adoption seeks to ensure that the business communities, as described previously, are
effectively using Salesforce CRM and that the features that have been implemented are
being properly utilized and continue to successfully address the business challenges.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 541 ]
To enable the monitoring of user adoption, there needs to be effective reports and
dashboards to capture adoption metrics, where the following areas can be considered when
building user adoption metrics:
Usage
Data quality
Business performance
Usage
The first key requirement for ensuring that Salesforce CRM is being appropriately used is
by measuring the number and frequency of users logging in to the system. You also need to
ensure that users are actively and consistently updating data and creating new Leads,
Contacts, Opportunities, and/or Cases depending on their roles in the organization.
Having a well implemented business application should help to make business processes
simple and hide complexity; this all helps to increase user adoption. However, making a
computer application appear simple often requires a considered approach and sometimes
takes far more effort than leaving it in its natural complex state. Removing obstacles and
unnecessary features takes time and effort, but it is time and effort well spent and will yield
results and hopefully result in higher adoption rates.
Simplicity
As a platform, Salesforce CRM has proven to be highly successful since its conception a
decade ago, and the number of organizations and subscriptions to the service grows year on
year. Much of this success can be attributed to the simplicity, ease of use, and focus on user
productivity that the platform affords.
While you may feel justified in introducing new mandatory fields and enforcing data
capture requirements into the application, this can sometimes make the system less user-
friendly. Sometimes, applications that offer the simplest solution for a given problem are
more likely to be rewarded with acceptance and adoption by your Salesforce community.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 542 ]
Connectivity
Enabling users to connect information from other tools, such as Microsoft Outlook, and
fully integrate Salesforce CRM with other such business systems provides a mechanism for
accessing all the information users need.
Salesforce Mobile
In the past, mobile devices that were capable of accessing software applications were very
expensive. Often these devices were regarded as a nice to have accessory by management
and seen as a company perk by field teams. Today, mobile devices are far more prevalent
within the business environment and organizations are increasingly realizing the benefits of
using mobile phones and devices to access business applications.
Salesforce.com provides several mobile apps and solutions to keep your users connected
and productive when using their mobile devices. These solutions are covered in detail in
the next chapter, Chapter 10, Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM.
Communications
Users are far more likely to adopt Salesforce CRM when they know that their peers and
colleagues are achieving results from its use. By communicating both the business and
personal results, for example, an increase in company sales and the resulting sales
commissions paid to the sales team, you can encourage others to adopt the system.
Data quality
Data quality is a valuable metric for measuring adoption. Although outlined previously, it
is advisable not to over complicate the entering of information with needless validation; it is
important that any critical fields are completed.
When certain fields are consistently filled out, user acceptance will increase as it provides
good data integrity and reliability that translates into higher user confidence and higher
adoption.

Extending and Enhancing Salesforce CRM
[ 543 ]
Business performance
Usage should also reflect business performance and compliance metrics that are used to
ensure that users are not just using the application, but are using it in a way that enhances
business effectiveness. Here, metrics can be built that will uncover patterns and trends that
track performance levels, and can then identify areas that need improvement.
This has been a quick overview of areas that can be used to generate metrics that you can
track and there is an enormous quantity of metrics that can be generated.
There is a balance, however, in getting accurate views without overcomplicating and
spawning too many metrics. Here, it is often best to create the minimum number of metrics
that can adequately capture and track the success of the business performance objectives.
Certain performance indicators can be established to identify the business sales revenues,
which are listed as follows:
Compare the current fiscal year against last year's sales by month, say, to
measure cyclical variances.
Compare sales from existing customers against new customers to measure what
customer type revenue is coming from and enhance CRM activities accordingly.
Compare won and lost sales ratios to measure the effectiveness of deal closure,
see why deals are getting lost, and learn from the reasons.
Measure the sales pipeline by sales stage to identify where new opportunities are
appearing.
Measure key opportunities in the sales pipeline to identify the current key
opportunities to ensure they get the right attention.
Measure closed sales actuals against quota. Here, you can introduce a closed sales
leaderboard to identify who your top deal-closers are. This can sometimes be
seen as a way of shaming bad performers, but sales management can use this
information positively to get the top performers to share knowledge and best
practices to help the organization.
For marketing-specific metrics, the following examples can be performed:
Measure campaigns by Return On Investment (ROI), Actual ROI, by campaign
type, and average opportunity amount per campaign
Measure lead conversion rates

[ 544 ]
There are many dashboards that you can install from AppExchange that give metrics for
how Salesforce is being used. The following is called Salesforce Adoption Dashboards,
which is an example from labs.force.com:
The Salesforce Adoption Dashboards app from Salesforce.com is
available from the AppExchange Marketplace directly through the
following URL: h t t p ://a p p e x c h a n g e . s a l e s f o r c e . c o m /l i s t i n g D e t a i l ?l

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the core features of Salesforce CRM that can be enhanced by
adding additional functionality with external applications from the AppExchange
Marketplace.
We discovered how easy it is to build a mashup in Salesforce CRM using the Visualforce
technology and looked at how, with the use of Visualforce pages, we can extend the
standard page functionality of the Salesforce CRM.
We looked at the concept of web mashups from the perspective of both the client-side and
server-side aspects of web technologies. We also described the difference between
presentation mashups, which are rendered in an Internet browser, and services that require
more complex features, such as web services.
We were introduced to the ways in which Visualforce pages can be controlled, where we
looked at the use of Apex code, which can extend the functionality within the Salesforce
CRM platform. Apex triggers were briefly covered, where we considered the need for
careful implementation in order to observe the order of execution for workflow rules and
triggers to ensure that no unwanted ripple effects were introduced.

[ 547 ]
We looked at the importance for planning and scheduling the release of changes into the
Salesforce application and provided some best practices relating to change management.
We also looked at how to improve user adoption by giving users incentives to use the
system by providing them with functionality that improves the way they work and offering
valuable information and tools not available elsewhere within the organization.
Finally, we posed questions to help clarify some of the key features of the Salesforce
AppExchange Marketplace.
In the next chapter, we will look at the administration of mobile features within Salesforce
CRM.

Administrating the Mobile
Features of Salesforce CRM
In the previous chapter, we looked at how external third-party web functionality can be
used within Salesforce where we introduced Visualforce and provided a detailed guide to
using the Salesforce AppExchange which provides the ability to extend and enhance the
core functionality of Salesforce CRM.
In this chapter, we will look at the administration of Salesforce Mobile solutions, which can
significantly improve productivity and user satisfaction for users accessing data and
application functionality whilst mobile and away from the office.
In the past, mobile devices that were capable of accessing software applications were very
expensive. Often these devices were regarded as a nice accessory by management, and seen
as a company perk by field-based teams.
Today, mobile devices are almost ubiquitous within the business environment, and
organizations of all sizes are realizing the benefits of using mobile phones and devices to
access business applications.
Salesforce has taken the lead in recognizing how mobile has become the new standard for
being connected in people's personal and professional lives. And how more and more, the
users of their apps are living lives connected to the Internet, but rather than sitting at a desk
in the office, they are in between meetings, on the road, in planes, in trains, in cabs, or even
in the queue for lunch. As a result, Salesforce have developed innovative mobile solutions
that help you and your users embrace this mobile-first world in Salesforce CRM.

Accessing Salesforce mobile solutions
Salesforce offers two varieties of mobile solutions, namely mobile browser apps and
downloadable apps. Mobile browser apps, as the name suggests, are accessed using a web
browser that is available on a mobile device. Downloadable apps are accessed by first
downloading the client software from, say, the Apple App Store or Google Play and then
installing it onto the mobile device. Mobile browser apps and downloadable apps offer
various features and benefits and, as will be covered, are available for various Salesforce
mobile products and device combinations.
Most mobile devices these days have some degree of web browser capability, which may be
used to access Salesforce CRM, however some Salesforce mobile products are optimized for
use with certain devices. By accessing a Salesforce mobile browser app, your users do not
require anything to be installed. Supported mobile browsers for Salesforce are generally
available on Android, Apple, BlackBerry, and Microsoft Windows 8.1 devices.
Downloadable apps, on the other hand, will require the app to be first downloaded from
the App Store for Apple devices or from Google Play for Android devices and then
installed on the mobile device.

[ 550 ]
Salesforce mobile products overview
Salesforce have provided some of their mobile products as downloadable apps while others
have been provided as both downloadable and mobile browser-based. The following list
outlines the various mobile app products, features, and capabilities used for accessing
Salesforce CRM on mobile devices:
SalesforceA
Salesforce Touch
Salesforce Classic
Salesforce1
Salesforce Touch is no longer available and is mentioned here for
information as this product has been recently incorporated into the
Salesforce1 product.
SalesforceA
SalesforceA is a downloadable system administration app that allows you to manage your
organization users and view certain information on your Salesforce organization from your
mobile device. SalesforceA is intended to be used by system administrators as it is
restricted to users with the Manage Users permission.
The SalesforceA app provides the facilities to carry out user tasks such as deactivating or
freezing users, resetting passwords, unlocking users, editing user details, calling and
emailing users, and assigning permission sets.

[ 551 ]
These user task buttons are displayed as action icons as shown in the following screenshot:
These icons are presented in the action bar at the bottom of the mobile device screen as
shown in the following screenshot:

In addition to the user tasks, you can view system status and also switch between your user
accounts in multiple organization. This allows you to access different organizations and
communities without having to log out and log back in to each user account. By staying
logged into multiple accounts in different organization, you will save time by easily
switching to the particular orgnizations user account that you need to access.
SalesforceA supported devices
At the time of writing, the following devices are supported by Salesforce for use with the
SalesforceA downloadable app:
Android phones
Apple iPhone
Apple iPod Touch
SalesforceA can be installed from Google Play for Android phones and Apple App Store
for Apple devices.
Salesforce Touch
Salesforce Touch is the name of an earlier Salesforce mobile product and is no longer
available. Within the Spring '14 release, Salesforce Touch was incorporated into the
Salesforce1 app, hence both the Salesforce Touch mobile browser and Salesforce Touch
downloadable apps are no longer available but the functionality that they once offered are
available in Salesforce1, which is covered later in this chapter.
Salesforce Classic
Salesforce Classic is a more mature product within the mobile solutions provided by
Salesforce and provides mobile access to Salesforce CRM data, tasks, and calendar, and
integrates that data with users email and mobile devices.
There are two types of Salesforce Classic, namely a full version and a free version. The full
version of the Salesforce Classic app requires mobile licenses, which may be part of your
standard Salesforce CRM licenses. There is also a free, limited version of Salesforce Classic
that allows any Salesforce CRM user who does not have a mobile license to download a
free, restricted version of Salesforce Classic.

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 553 ]
Since Summer '16, the free version of Salesforce Classic Mobile has no
longer been available for new organizations or for existing organizations
that did not previously have it enabled. For organizations that had already
enabled the free version before Summer '16, there was no change.
Salesforce Classic supported Operating Systems
At the time of writing, the supported operating systems for Salesforce Classic downloadable
apps are as follows:
Android
Apple iOS
BlackBerry
Users can install the downloadable apps from the App Store, Google Play, and Blackberry
World. However recently-released mobile devices may not be supported because every
device must be put through Salesforce official certification process.
Salesforce Classic data availability
Most standard Sales Objects and some Service Objects are also available; if you are using the
full version, custom objects and configurations are also supported. The free version allows
your users to view, create, edit, and delete only accounts, assets, contacts, leads,
opportunities, events, tasks, cases, and solutions. Users can also access their dashboards.
In the free version of Salesforce Classic, only records that users have recently accessed in the
Salesforce CRM browser app are automatically synchronized to their mobile devices.
However, users can search for and download any records that are not automatically
delivered to their mobile devices.
In addition to recently accessed records, the default configuration
synchronizes activities closed in the past five days and open activities due
in the next 30 days.
For both the full and free version of Salesforce Classic, any items that are downloaded from
Salesforce become a permanent part of your users mobile data set.

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 554 ]
Salesforce Classic Administration
You can manage your organizations access to the Salesforce Classic apps and there are
separate features for controlling access depending on whether you are setting up the full or
the free version.
Salesforce Classic Full Version Access
The Mobile User checkbox on the user record assigns a mobile license to users, which
enables use of the full version of Salesforce Classic. This option is set and appears as shown
in the following screenshot:
The Salesforce Classic Mobile app is to be retired in December 1, 2017.
At the time of writing, Salesforce has announced that the Salesforce Classic
Mobile app is to be retired and will no longer be available from December
1, 2017. From this date, any current orgnizations and users with Salesforce
Classic Mobile apps installed will see their app disabled. Also on
December 1, 2017 the Salesforce Classic Mobile app is to be removed from
Google Play and the App Store.
Salesforce Classic Free Version Access
Other Salesforce users without an assigned mobile license may be able to access the free
version of Salesforce Classic depending upon when the Salesforce organization was created
and whether Salesforce Classic Lite has been enabled.
Salesforce Classic Lite is not available for new organizations and any
organization that did not have it enabled, or disabled it after the Summer
'16 release.
The option that enables Salesforce Classic Lite can be found by navigating as follows:
Don't disable the Enable Salesforce Classic Lite checkbox, even temporarily, if you want
your users to retain access to the free version of Salesforce Classic Mobile. If you disable this
option, the checkbox is immediately removed from the Salesforce Classic Mobile Settings
page and unlicensed users are unable to use the Salesforce Classic Mobile app.
Furthermore, if you deselect this option while users are running the app, the Salesforce data
on their devices is erased the next time the devices synchronize with Salesforce.

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 555 ]
If you disable the free version of Salesforce Classic Mobile in error, contact Salesforce
customer support for assistance restoring access for unlicensed users.
Salesforce Classic Lite access is an organization-wide setting. It enables access for all active
users and cannot be enabled for individual users.
Now click Edit band then deselect the Enable Salesforce Classic Lite option as shown in
the following screenshot:

[ 556 ]
If you deselect this option while users are running the Salesforce Classic
app, the Salesforce data on their mobile devices is deleted the next time
that device synchronizes with Salesforce.
Mobile Administration Console
The Mobile Administration Console is available to set up and manage mobile
configurations and offers the following five step process to set up Salesforce Classic:
Create a mobile configuration: This step creates a mobile configuration and
1.
allows the selection of users and/or profiles that will be linked to the
configuration.
Define the data set: In this step, you will specify the data set that will be synced
2.
to the mobile device and select the objects and record filters for those objects.
Set the mobile data set size: In this step, the size of the mobile data set is
3.
specified and you can test the data size against user accounts. For this test, you
should aim to test a mobile configuration with the accounts of specific users that
will be assigned to the configuration.
Exclude fields: In this optional step, you can modify any object's mobile page
4.
layout and exclude fields. This is often needed because unnecessary fields
consume memory and makes it slow to scroll through pages on the mobile
device.
Send a mass email: This is the final step of the Mobile Administration Console,
5.
which will allow you to send a mass email to mobile users to notify them of the
availability of the mobile client application.

Salesforce1
Salesforce1 is Salesforce's next-generation mobile CRM platform, which has been designed
for Salesforce's customers, developers, and ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) to
connect mobile apps, browser apps and third-party app services. Salesforce1 has been
developed for a mobile-first environment and demonstrates how Salesforce's focus as a 
platform provider aims to connect the enterprise with systems that can be programmed
through APIs along with mobile apps and services that can be utilized by marketing, sales,
and customer service.
There are two ways to use Salesforce1; either using a mobile browser app that users access
by logging into Salesforce from a supported mobile browser, and downloadable apps that
users install from the App Store or Google Play. Either way, Salesforce1 allows users to
access and update Salesforce data from an interface that has been optimized for navigating
and working on their touchscreen mobile devices.

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 558 ]
Using Salesforce1, records can be viewed, edited, and created. Users can manage their
activities, view their dashboards, and use Chatter. Salesforce1 also supports many standard
objects and list views, all custom objects, plus the integration of other mobile apps, and
many of your organizations Salesforce customizations, including Visualforce tabs and
pages.
Salesforce1 supported devices
At the time of writing, the following devices are supported by Salesforce for the Salesforce1
mobile browser app:
Android phones
Apple iPad
Apple iPhone
BlackBerry Z10
Windows 8.1 phones (Beta support)
At the time of writing, Salesforce specifies the following devices as being supported for the
Salesforce1 downloadable app:
Android phones
Apple iPad
Apple iPhone
Salesforce1 data availability
Your organization edition, the user's license type, along with the user's profile and any
permission sets determines the data available to the user within Salesforce1.
Generally, users have the same visibility of objects, record types, fields, and page layouts
that they have while accessing the full Salesforce browser app. However, at the time of
writing, not all data is available in the current release of the Salesforce1 app.
In Winter'17, the following key objects will be fully accessible from the Salesforce1
navigation menu: Accounts, Campaigns, Cases, Contacts, Contracts, Leads, Opportunities,
Tasks, Users, Dashboards, and Events, however, are restricted to being only viewable from
the Salesforce1 navigation menu.

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 559 ]
Custom objects are fully accessible if they have a tab that the user can
access.
For new users who have yet to build a history of recent objects, they initially see a set of
default objects in the Recent section in the Salesforce1 navigation menu.
The majority of the standard and custom fields, and most of the related lists for the
supported objects are available on these records, however at the time of writing, the links
on formula fields are not supported, which is the Rich Text area field support exception that
exists in Salesforce1.
Rich Text area ﬁeld exception in Salesforce1
Salesforce1 considers Rich Text area fields to be long-text area fields. As such, these fields
do not support HTML content or images and are truncated at 1,000 characters (including
any HTML content).
Consider removing Rich Text area fields from Salesforce1 mobile page
layouts.
A Rich Text area field that contains an existing text value greater than
1,000 characters will be truncated if it is edited in Salesforce1.
Salesforce1 Administration
You can manage your organizations access to the Salesforce1 apps; there are two areas of
administration: the mobile browser app that users access by logging in to Salesforce from a
supported mobile browser, and the downloadable app that users install from the App Store
or Google Play. The following sections describe the ways to control user access for each of
these mobile apps.
Salesforce1 Mobile Browser App access
You can control whether users can access the Salesforce1 mobile browser app when they log
into Salesforce from a mobile browser. To select or deselect this feature, navigate to Setup |
Mobile Administration | Salesforce1 | Settings, as shown in the following screenshot:

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 560 ]
By checking the Enable the Salesforce1 mobile browser app checkbox, all users are able to
access Salesforce1 from their mobile browsers. Deselecting this option turns off the mobile
browser app, which means users will automatically access the full Salesforce site from their
mobile browser.
By default, the mobile browser app is turned on in all Salesforce
organizations.
Salesforce1 desktop browser access
Checking the Enable the Salesforce1 mobile browser app checkbox as described in the
previous section also permits activated users access to Salesforce1 from their desktop
browsers.
Users can navigate to the Salesforce1 app within their desktop browser by appending
/one/one.app to the end of the Salesforce URL. As an example, for the following
Salesforce URL accessed from the server na10, you would enter the desktop browser
URL of h t t p s ://n a 10. s a l e s f o r c e . c o m /o n e /o n e . a p p .

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 561 ]
Salesforce1 downloadable App access
The Salesforce1 app is distributed as a managed package and within Salesforce it is
implemented as a connected app. You might already see the Salesforce1 connected app in
your list of installed apps as it may have been automatically installed in your organization.
The list of included apps can change with each Salesforce release but to
simplify administration, each package is asynchronously installed in
Salesforce organizations whenever any user in that organization first
accesses Salesforce1. However, to manually install or reinstall the
Salesforce1 package for connected apps, you can use the AppExchange.
To view the details for the Salesforce1 app in the connected app settings, navigate to Setup
| Manage Apps | Connected Apps. The apps that connect to your Salesforce organization
are then listed as shown in the following screenshot:

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 562 ]
Within the Connected Apps listing, you can control various features of the Salesforce1
mobile apps such as IP restriction, session timeout, and so on.
Salesforce1 notiﬁcations
Notifications allow all users in your organization to receive mobile notifications in
Salesforce1, for example, whenever they are mentioned in Chatter or whenever they receive
approval requests.
To activate mobile notifications, navigate to Setup | Mobile Administration |
Notifications | Settings, as shown in the following screenshot:
The following settings for notifications can be set as follows:
Enable in-app notifications: Set this option to keep users notified of relevant
Salesforce activity while they are using Salesforce1
Enable push notifications: Set this option to keep users notified of relevant
Salesforce activity when they are not using the Salesforce1 downloadable app.
Include full content in push notifications: Keep this checkbox unchecked if you
do not want users to receive full content in push notifications. This can prevent
users receiving potentially sensitive data that may be in comments, for example,
If you set this option, a pop-up dialog appears displaying terms and conditions
where you must click OK or Cancel.

Salesforce1 compact layouts
In Salesforce1, compact layouts are used to display the key fields on a record and are
specifically designed for viewing records on touchscreen mobile devices. As the space is
limited on mobile devices and quick recognition of records is important, the first four fields
that you assign to a compact layout are displayed.
If a mobile user does not have the required access to one of the first four
fields that have been assigned to a compact layout, the next field, if more
than four fields have been set on the layout, is used.
If you have yet to create custom compact layouts, the records will be displayed using a
read-only, predefined system default compact layout and after you have created a custom
compact layout, you can then set it as the primary compact layout for that object.
As with the full Salesforce CRM site, if you have record types associated with an object, you
can alter the primary compact layout assignment and assign specific compact layouts to
different record types. You can also clone a compact layout from its detail page.
The following field types cannot be included on compact layouts: text area, long text area,
Rich Text area, and multi-select picklist.
Salesforce1 oﬄine access
In Salesforce1, the mechanism for handling offline access is determined by users most
recently used records. These most recently used records are cached for offline access and at
the time of writing, are read-only.
The cached data is encrypted and secured through persistent storage by
the Salesforce1 downloadable apps. Offline access is available in the
Salesforce1 downloadable apps version 6.0 and later and was first released
in Summer '14.

[ 565 ]
Offline access is enabled by default when the Salesforce1 downloadable app is installed. To
manage these settings, navigate to Setup | Mobile Administration | Offline. Now check or
uncheck the Enable Offline Sync for Salesforce1 as shown in the following screenshot:
When offline access is enabled, data based on the objects is downloaded to each user's
mobile device and presented in the Recent section of the Salesforce1 navigation menu, and
on the user's most recently viewed records. The data is encrypted and stored in a secure,
persistent cache on the mobile device.
Salesforce1 Setup with the Salesforce1 Wizard
The Salesforce1 Wizard simplifies the setting up of the Salesforce1 mobile app. The wizard
offers a visual tour of the key setup steps and is useful if you are new to Salesforce1 or need

Salesforce1 diﬀerences from the Full Salesforce CRM browser app
In the Winter' 2017 release and at the time of writing, Salesforce1 does not have all of the
features of the full Salesforce CRM site, and in some areas includes functionality that is not
available or is different to the full Salesforce site.
As an example, in the full Salesforce CRM site, compact layouts determine which fields
appear in the Chatter feed item, which appears after a user creates a record via a publisher
action. However, compact layouts in Salesforce1 are used to display the key fields on a
record.
For details about the current features that differ between the full Salesforce CRM site and
Salesforce1, please refer to Salesforce1 Limits and Differences from the Full Salesforce Site
within the Salesforce Help menu sections.
Mobile Dashboards
The Mobile Dashboards solution is an app specifically developed to work on the Apple
iPad device. The setting to allows users to install the app is automatically enabled for all
Salesforce organization. This permits users to access and install the app on their Apple
iPads without any admin configuration or support.
Since Summer '2015, the Mobile Dashboards for iPad app is no longer
supported. At the time of writing, the app can continue to be used
Salesforce no longer provides support or enhancements to the app.
Salesforce recommends migrating users' experience and requirements for
Mobile Dashboards to the Salesforce1 app.
To enable or disable The Mobile Dashboards for iPad app, navigate to Setup |
MobileAdministration | Mobile Dashboards, as shown in the following screenshot:

Salesforce Adoption Manager
The Salesforce Adoption Manager is a Salesforce1 training and engagement tool provided
by Salesforce that sends mobile users intelligent email notifications. The objective of the tool
is to drive adoption of the Salesforce1 mobile app by new Salesforce1 users. It also engages
with existing users who have not used Salesforce1 for a while to encourage them to start re-
using the app.
Salesforce Adoption Manager is only available, at the time of writing, in
the following countries; USA, UK, and Australia.
To enable Salesforce Adoption Manager, navigate to Setup | Manage Users | Adoption
Manager and select Enable Salesforce Adoption Manager, as shown in the following

Summary
In this chapter we have looked at ways that mobiles have become the new norm for staying
connected in both our personal and professional lives.
Salesforce has recognized that individuals are spending more of their time connected to the
cloud and using cloud-based business applications and that these business apps are
increasingly being used in a mobile context rather than being used at a desk in an office.
To try and help their customers become successful businesses of this mobile-first world,
Salesforce have produced various mobile solutions that can help users get things done,
regardless of where they are and what they are doing.
In this chapter we have described the features of SalesforceA, a mobile admin app that can
help you manage users and monitor the status of Salesforce whilst on the move.
We described the features and benefits of Salesforce1 which is available as a downloadable

Administrating the Mobile Features of Salesforce CRM
[ 577 ]
app and a browser app. Here we detailed the setting up and administration of the solution,
and the current capabilities of Salesforce1 at the time of writing.
We also looked at historic Salesforce mobile solutions such as Salesforce Touch which has
being replaced by Salesforce1 and Salesforce Classic.
Finally, we posed questions to help clarify some of the key features of the Salesforce1
mobile solution.
In the next chapter, we will look at the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, provided
by Salesforce, which assesses candidate's knowledge of system management and
configuration within the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, and the Collaboration Cloud and
outline resources and strategies to help pass the Certified Administrator exam.

Studying for the Certified
Administrator Exam
In the previous chapter, we looked at the administration of Salesforce mobile features which
can significantly improve productivity and user satisfaction enabling users to access data
and application functionality whilst on the move and showed how to configure Salesforce
Classic and Salesforce1 mobile solutions.
In this chapter, we will look at the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, which is the
first credential in Salesforce's Certified Administrator program that has been developed by
Salesforce for the assessment of individuals who have Salesforce CRM administration
knowledge and experience. The Certified Administrator program covers the applications
that form the core elements of Salesforce CRM and includes system management and the
configuration options that are available to a Salesforce CRM administrator within the Sales
Cloud, the Service Cloud, and the Collaboration Cloud.
The Salesforce Certified Administrator exam is used to measure individual's ability to
manage and maintain a Salesforce CRM organization. Individuals that pass the exam can be
considered proficient in applying the features and functionality for configuration and
system management as well as extending their knowledge and accessing advanced learning
paths within the Certified Administrator program.
In this chapter, we outline the various resources that are available to study for the Salesforce
Certified Administrator exam. Here we review the Salesforce Certified Administrator Study
Guide and discuss both, official Salesforce and other third-party resources that will help
you understand the features and functionalities that are to be found in the exam. We also
look at the process of planning, booking, and sitting the exam, and offer some insight into
the types of questions that may appear and offer some suggestions to deal with the
questions during the exam.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
Overview of the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam
Self-assessment of your Salesforce CRM skills and knowledge
Suggested resources for studying
Using the Salesforce Certified Administrator study guide
Registering for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam
What to expect during and after the exam
Overview of the Salesforce Certified
Administrator exam
The Salesforce Certified Administrator exam consists of 60 multiple-choice (or single-
choice) questions and the maximum time allowed is 90 minutes. There is no mandatory
prerequisite qualification or experience; however, Salesforce highly recommends that
candidates have some real-world experience administering an organization or attend a
suitable training course prior to sitting the exam, details of which are covered later in this
chapter.
The pass mark for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam is currently
39 correct answers out of the available 60, which is specified as a
percentage passing score of 65%. At the time of writing, the cost of
registering for the exam is $200 USD and the cost of registering to re-sit the
exam is $100 USD.
During the exam, no written or online resource may be referenced and when you submit
the exam you are presented with your exam result immediately. The result is either a pass
or fail; there is neither an indication of the number of correct or incorrect answers, nor is
there any response that explains the reason for the correct or incorrect answers.
Some people have opined on social networking sites that the questions they were presented
with during their Salesforce Certified Administrator exam made for a far more difficult
examination than anything they had previously sat and for one individual they felt it was
more difficult than their bachelor's degree or their MBA.
People often cite the reason for the difficulty of the exam is that the way in which the
multiple-choice questions are worded means that there are one or two word differences
between the available choice of answer. This then suggests that the question may be
subjective, which presents a challenge when choosing the expected answer.

Studying for the Certified Administrator Exam
[ 580 ]
Later in this chapter, there is an indication of how these potentially subjective questions
could be presented and some suggested strategies that may help to derive the correct
answer.
Once you have passed the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, there is a maintenance
exam which is a requirement to remain in, Salesforce Certified Administrator program. This
is mandatory for all Salesforce Certified individuals to keep their knowledge current as
Salesforce releases updates to the Salesforce CRM platform.
At the time of writing, the cost of registering for the annual maintenance
fee for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam is $100 USD.
Self-assessment
Before considering taking the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, it is useful to try to
gauge just how much knowledge and experience you have in Salesforce CRM
administration. Since the exam is part of the Salesforce Certified Administrator program,
which exists to assess an individual's ability to implement Salesforce CRM administration,
the purpose of the exam is to assess the skills and ensure candidates have the correct level
of knowledge in the following features or functions:
Standard and Custom Objects
Security and Access
Analytics, Reports, and Dashboards
Data Management
User Setup
Sales and Marketing Applications
Workflow Automation
Service and Support Applications
Activity Management
AppExchange
Desktop and Mobile Administration
Content and Folder Management
Chatter

Global User Interface
Organization Setup
The features and functions that are listed are taken from the Salesforce Certified
Administrator exam Study Guide and will be covered in detail later in this chapter. You
should review the features and functions that are listed here and try to give higher or lesser
importance accordingly. This means that the number of questions that may be posed will
vary in line with the percentages. You should review the features and functions that are
listed in this section to help assess what areas your strengths and weaknesses lie in and
allow you to plan your studying accordingly.
By going through the list, you can assess how much of the subject area you currently know
and which areas you may need to study more. Even seasoned Salesforce professionals may
not have experience in all of the areas that are likely to be covered in the exam, so there will
generally be some need to study the areas of weakness.
For example, there could be as high as 11 questions, (or 18% exam coverage), in the exam
covering standard and custom objects or as few as one question, (or 2% exam coverage) for
Chatter. Given these numbers, it does seem prudent to focus more of your time available
for study on the features and functions of the chapters that carry the largest number of
questions.
Resources for studying
There are many resources available to help the process of studying for the Salesforce
Certified Administrator exam. The resources that will be outlined in this section include
official Salesforce resources and third-party resources that have been provided by the wider
Salesforce community. There are resources that require some level of payment and some
that are free for both the official and third-party resources.
If you are fortunate to be currently working with the Salesforce CRM platform for a
Salesforce customer or partner and have system administrator permission, then you should
be able to gain valuable on-the-job experience and will be able to gain much of the
knowledge of the features and functionality whilst carrying out your day job.
For individuals that may not currently be full-time system administrators in their company,
but work for organizations with a training budget and a desire to train them in the role of
Salesforce administrator, these individuals can take advantage of the instructor-led training
courses that are produced by Salesforce. Also, individuals who are able to pay for their own
training can attend these official instructor-led Salesforce training courses.

functionality of Salesforce CRM in general. There is one course in particular that has been
designed by Salesforce to provide certification preparation and guidance toward the
Certified Salesforce Administrator exam and is called Preparing for Your Salesforce
Administrator Certification.
Salesforce Developer Edition
It can be assumed that if you have read this far into this book, you have already signed up
or have access to a Salesforce instance. If you have been using your company's organization
either within the production instance or a sandbox, it may be wise to sign up for your own
developer organization.
To sign up for a free Developer Edition Salesforce CRM organization
navigate to: h t t p s ://d e v e l o p e r . s a l e s f o r c e . c o m /s i g n u p
You may think that having a developer organization is only needed by developers and not
system administrators, but the environment is intended for use by both disciplines.
It is particularly beneficial to set up a developer organization by using a personal e-mail
address; this allows you to try out changes and switch on or off functionality without
affecting others in your company organization, even if you are no longer associated with
the company that you were working with, to keep the changes and access the organization.

Third-party resources
There are a number of resources that are not endorsed by Salesforce that may be useful. A
word of caution though; they are not sanctioned or endorsed by Salesforce and you need to
be very careful when using these types of material.
It is essential that you carry out due diligence to ensure that the
information is accurate and that the facts shown are valid for the current
version of the Salesforce CRM platform.
The following types of resources are not official Salesforce resources and are not endorsed
by Salesforce but may or may not be useful to help identify further information that helps
with the studying of the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam:
Salesforce study groups
Blogs
Forums
Online tests
Flash cards
Be wary of third-party resources that are presenting questions and answers as they are often
outdated, no longer valid, or in some cases, completely incorrect and misleading. For the
online tests and flash cards, verify first that they are correct for the current release of
Salesforce CRM.
It is suggested not to use them without carrying out some due diligence to ensure the
questions that are presented are accurate.
The Salesforce Certified Administrator Study Guide
Salesforce provides a study guide for the Certified Administrator exam and some
guidelines on what material to be familiar with.
The study guide is useful as it outlines the features and functions that a candidate with
hands-on experience would have demonstrated the application of. It also shows the
weighting of the features and functions that are applied to the Salesforce Certified
Administrator exam. By looking at the weighting, it is possible to determine the
approximate number of questions that appear and help you to study the highest areas.

Studying for the Certified Administrator Exam
[ 586 ]
It is highly likely that even the most seasoned Salesforce professional will not have applied
some of the features and functions that are tested, so you will need to appraise yourself in
this area to see where you may need to study more.

We will now review the first example question that has been provided by Salesforce and
look at how we can breakdown and analyze the information that is contained in the
question in order to derive the correct answer.
By analyzing the question we can identify what business requirements are covered in the
scenario that is presented and then work out which feature or functionality of Salesforce
administration could be used to satisfy these requirements.

Conclusion
We can see that a) Profiles is the correct answer.
Profiles are a control mechanism used to determine the functions the user can perform. A
group of users can be set with a common profile and within this profile access to a custom
application can be disabled therefore this answer contains the correct feature that meets the
requirement as outlined in the scenario for the question.
Registering for the Salesforce Certified
Administrator exam
Before you can register for the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, you will need to
register your details with Webassessor.
To access the Salesforce Webassessor exam registration page navigate to: h
t t p s ://w w w . w e b a s s e s s o r . c o m /s a l e s f o r c e
Once you have registered and created an account, you can register for a new exam with the
same link.
When booking the Salesforce Certified Administrator exam, you will
notice that there is a version of the exam, for example, WI18 (winter'18),
SP19 (spring'19), SU19 (summer '19).
When you book the exam, you have the choice to take the exam at a testing center or use
online proctoring, which allows you to sit the exam remotely from your own computer.
Online proctored exams are delivered through secure software, which allows the exam to
be monitored through a webcam.
If you opt for the testing center you will first select a test center and then you will be
presented with a calendar showing available dates in which you can select a suitable date
and time.

Rescheduling the exam
If you are unable to take the test at the date and time that was scheduled, or you feel that
you are not ready to take it, you must reschedule the exam with at least 72 hour's notice or
you will be charged a reschedule fee.
You will notice that the booked exam shows a version of the exam, for example, WI18
(winter '18), SP19 (spring '19), SU19 (summer '19). If you book your exam in an earlier
period, but take your after rescheduling the exam, the exam will automatically be set to the
latest version. For example, you register for the exam during SU17 (summer '17), but
reschedule after, say, around November, which takes your exam to fall into the WI18
(winter '18) exam period.
What to expect during and after the exam
You need to arrive 15 minutes prior to the examination and will not be able to sit the exam
if you are late. Do not bring too much baggage into the testing center as you only have a
small locker in which to store all your personal belongings.
You will need to take two forms of identifying details, which can be your passport and
driving license. In addition, you need to either print the e-mail that you received when you
registered for the exam, or show the test code to the examination room proctor as they will
need the code to start the exam. Alternatively, show the exam proctor the code on your
smartphone.
During the exam
You are provided with a couple of sheets of paper or a clean wipe sheet and dry wipe pens,
which you can use to make notes. It is worth reading the questions slowly as it is quite easy
to make a snap judgement. In certain situations you may find it helpful to write notes on the
written materials just to clarify your understanding of the question.
Also, you may find that a question that you are currently answering has provided a clue for
a question you encountered earlier in the exam that you did not know and so is currently
set as Marked for Review.

[ 594 ]
Do not panic if you find yourself spending too long on one question and you are unable to
proceed either because of the complexity of the exam question or you do not know with
total confidence. Mark the question for review and then come back to it later.
Be mindful of the 90-minute time limit. The remaining time is shown in the upper-left hand
of the screen.
You can review the questions that have been marked for review by clicking Review Exam.
The screen shows the questions that have been marked for review marked with an asterisk.
After the exam
As soon as you click the Finish exam button, you will be notified on-screen whether you
have passed or failed. If you have passed, you will receive an e-mail confirming the pass.
It may take a short time for the confirmation e-mail showing your result to be received. I
personally sat the exam at 10:30 in the morning and did not get the result until later that
evening. In this scenario, by logging into the Webassessor login after the exam I was able to
see my result.
You can show that you have successfully gained the Salesforce Certified Administration
credential by agreeing to show your details via the Webassessor site. When this is done,
people can navigate to the certification verification page and search and select your name to
display the types of certification that you hold.
 
To access the certification verification page navigate to: h t t p ://c e r t i f i c a
