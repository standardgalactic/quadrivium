Foreword
When did you stop drawing?
As a professional artist I am often asked: When did I begin to draw? Or in other words, how long have I
been drawing. I have tried to answer this question, but the truth is that I’m not exactly sure. I do know
that I have drawn as long as I can remember. Most children enjoy drawing as one of their games. I guess 
I just never stopped.
I had the great fortune to be born into a family sensitive to the visual arts: My mother was a professional
ceramist before marrying my father. My father had an advertising agency and his best friend (and his
agency’s principal illustrator) was the acclaimed painter Ezequiel Lopez. It seems perfectly natural to me
that in addition to myself, two of my four siblings are professional artists.
Growing up in Spain, I remember my mother always encouraging our artistic and cultural interests, taking
us to visit museums and galleries and keeping us well stocked with art supplies. You see, when she was 
a little girl, Spain was going through the period in its history known as “post-guerra,” the decade which
followed the Spanish Civil War. Art supplies were a luxury at that time. My mother remembers wanting 
to draw as a little girl and, having no pencil or paper, scratching the white stucco walls of her house with
coins to create gray marks, crating a kind of rustic silver-point graffiti that understandably drove my
grandparents nuts. So as a parent, my mother made certain that her children always had arts and crafts
materials available for play.
When I was about ten years old, my mother took up painting as a hobby. She armed herself with all the
proper tools for making art, including an encyclopedia on how-to-draw-and-paint. I remember the first
time I set eyes on the black cloth hardbound cover of its first volume. Printed across its austere cover in
bold white letters was “Drawing is Easy” (“Dibujar es fácil”). I opened the book and discovered step by 
step methods for creating images that, until that moment, had seemed impossible to put down on paper:
portraits, landscapes, figures, and animals. I was amazed! From that point on, I devoured the information
in that encyclopedia, completing most of the assignments that the books proposed just for my own enjoy-
ment. As the years passed, I received extensive training in art: As a teenager I enrolled in a private academy
that taught traditional drawing and painting. Later, I attended the University of Madrid, the Maryland
Institute College of Art and Towson University. I have been teaching college courses in art for the past 
fifteen years. Thirty years later, the lessons I learned in that encyclopedia are still present in my mind. I
use them in my own work as well as my instruction of others.
Which brings me to The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Drawing. Don’t let the funny title fool you. This book 
is a serious and practical introduction for those interested in learning the basic aspects of drawing. Its tone
is casual and friendly. It assumes that you don’t know anything about art, but are serious and willing to
learn. Its contents are approximately those of a basic comprehensive course in studio drawing at a first 
rate art college. In other words, it is light years beyond my beloved “Drawing is Easy,” which, since it was
printed in 1968, is by now quite limited and dated. The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Drawing, on the other
hand, incorporates all the current ideas on how to learn to draw. Despite the humorous name, this is 
not a book full of “tricks” that would show you how to draw flashy pictures if you can do certain effects.
You won’t find a single recipe inside on how to draw a “happy cloud,” like you would in those misleading
“learn to paint” television programs. This is the real thing. What you get from this book are the basic 
concepts for serious art making. You will learn to see like an artist, to choose a subject, to compose a 
picture, and to bring it to completion. And of course, you’ll learn how much fun this all can be.
Drawing is the basis for all forms of visual fine arts. Painting, printmaking, sculpture, illustration, photo-
graphy, mixed media, graphic design, fibers and digital art all rely on ideas that are generally explored 
by first learning to draw. Whatever you will eventually do artistically, whatever medium or style, you 
will benefit greatly from being exposed to The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Drawing. So don’t waste another
precious minute—let’s get started! What are you waiting for?
José Villarrubia, MFA, is a painter, photographer and digital artist, born in Madrid, Spain, but residing 
in Baltimore for the past twenty years. Since 1986, he has been included in over ninety international 
solo and group exhibitions in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. His work is in the permanent
collections of the Baltimore museum of Art and the Inter-American Development Bank. He is a full time
faculty member at the Maryland Institute College of Art, where he has been teaching drawing and digital
art for the past four years. He taught for twelve years in the art department of Towson University, and has
taught at the Walters Art Gallery and for the Bright Starts Program. His numerous lectures include those at
the Johns Hopkins University and the College Art Association. Entertainment Weekly has called his work
“Groundbreaking, a treat for the eyes!” 
Since 1992 Mr. Villarrubia has been the art reviewer for the literary magazine Lambda Book Report. He is
currently writing Koan, a book about the paintings of Jon J. Muth and Kent Williams to be published later
this year by Allen Spiegel Fine Arts.

Introduction
If you’ve got draw-o-phobia, you’re not alone. Millions of Americans (including, until this book, one 
of its coauthors) are afraid to pick up a pencil to try to represent an image on a page. You drew as a
child—we all did—but maybe you were laughed at by your peers or siblings early on, or maybe a “
well-meaning” art teacher discouraged your earliest efforts. Suddenly, you felt critical of your drawings,
unhappy with your attempts, worried that you would fail, and unwilling or afraid to try.
Drawing is thought of as magic by some, and an inherited trait by others, but neither of those ideas 
is true. The good news is it’s never too late to learn to draw or learn to draw more confidently and 
sensitively. The first step, in fact, is as simple as picking up a pencil and some paper and just drawing a
simple image on the page.
Pick a single flower, leaf, or branch, and sit and see it for the first time, then make a simple line 
drawing.
Give yourself a little time to draw. Try it now, here:
How did you feel while you were drawing? Did you relax and enjoy it? Did you feel nervous about how
you would do? Working through the exercises in this book will help you get past those fears and the
tendency to be too critical. You will have fun drawing and experience your own creativity. See? It won’t
be so hard. The rest of learning to draw will be a breeze, too.

How to Use This Book
Drawing is a basic skill, like writing, or riding a bicycle—it must be learned and practiced, but is within
your grasp. We’ve arranged this book so that you start off with easy stuff, like seeing, and then slowly
move through exercises that will take you further and further along in your drawing skills.
This book is divided into seven parts:
Part 1, “Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing,” introduces you to the pleasures of drawing and
seeing, including discovering the difference between your critical left brain and your creative right
brain. Tapping your own creativity may be the most exciting thing you have ever done. Plus, right off
the bat, we’ll be providing exercises to help you loosen up and exercise your drawing hand, entice your
creative right brain, and banish the left side, “Old Lefty,” out to left field, where he belongs. Learning to
just “see,” and to draw what you see, is fun and the beginning of an adventure in drawing that can take
you almost anywhere. A contour line drawing of an object is the place to start.
In Part 2, “Now You Are Ready to Draw,” you’ll meet some of the tools of the trade, including the
viewfinder frame and the plastic picture plane. We’ll show you how to make your own viewfinder frame
and plastic picture plane to take with you wherever you go, and how to use both of these tools to help
with your drawings. Then you’ll experiment with negative space, the spaces in and around an object or
objects. Seeing the negative space can greatly help your composition and drawings.
Part 3, “Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw,” has a lot of work to do. First, you need some
materials and a place to work, because you need to take yourself and your work seriously. We’ll begin
with simple groups of objects in a drawing and then move on to the full still life, exploring why artists
throughout the ages just love those fruits and veggies. We’ll also help you begin to choose what to
draw, what to draw it with, and how to make your way from a contour line to a consideration of form
and weight. Then we will look at those all-important details.
By Part 4, “Developing Drawing Skills,” you’ll be feeling much more confident about your drawing
skills. We’ll discuss some new materials and how to acquaint yourself with them. Journals and sketch-
books are next, a way for you to practice drawing every day. We’ll peer into some working artists’ stu-
dios to see what’s behind those light-filled windows and we’ll look at their views on drawing, their
studios, and their feelings about their work. Then, we’ll work on your portable drawing kit to take on
the road, and poke around your house and garden (and ours) to find some good subjects for your
sketchbook. 
In Part 5, “Out and About with Your Sketchbook,” we’ll get you out of the house. We’ll look at per-
spective, that all-important way of seeing three-dimensional space that all artists use, and then we’ll get
you outside to use your newfound knowledge. We will look at the land itself, elements in the landscape,
and then houses and other structures, so you will feel confident to tackle any and all the drawing chal-
lenges in your neighborhood or anywhere in the world. 
Part 6, “Drawing Animals and People,” looks at animals, humans, and the human figure as drawing
subjects. Action, gesture, proportion, shape, and form are the buzzwords here, for animals and the
human animal. We’ll explore why the nude has always been the object of artists’ 
affections—and why it may turn out to be yours as well. We’ll also look at gesture and movement—and
how to render them on the page.
Part 7, “Enjoying the Artist’s Life!” will put it all together, helping you express yourself in your draw-
ings. We’ll discuss how to frame and care for your work and how to expand your skills into new media,
projects, or into cyberspace. We’ll also go to the museum with you, and help you learn how you can
learn more about yourself by finding what art you’re drawn to.
Last, in the back of this book, you’ll find three appendixes, including a list of materials you may want
to purchase, a list of books for further reading, and a glossary, chock-full of art-y words. 
And, in the front of the book, you’ll find a tear-out reference card to take with you wherever you draw.
Extras
In addition to helping you learn how to draw, we’ve provided additional information to help you
along. These include sidebars like the following:

Drawing and Seeing, 
Seeing and Drawing
Learning to draw is learning a skill, and, like other skills that require practice, you can do it if
you try. Getting past your fears and the thought that “you can’t draw” is the first step. It will
help to discover the difference between your critical left brain and your creative right brain—and
then learn how to banish “Old Lefty” out to left field, where he belongs. He is no help when
learning to see and draw, and learning to “just see” will send him packing.
In this section, we provide exercises to help you loosen up and warm up your drawing hand, as
well as help you begin to see as an artist does.

➤Realizing the magic of drawing
➤Learning that drawing is seeing
➤Looking through the barriers
➤Understanding the two sides to every brain
When the artist is alive in any person, whatever his kind of work may be, he becomes an in-
ventive, searching, daring, self-expressive creature. He becomes interesting to other people. He
disturbs, upsets, enlightens, and opens ways for a better understanding. Where those who are
not artists are trying to close the book, he opens it and shows there are still more pages possi-

—Robert Henri, The Art Spirit (1923)
You may think of drawing as something magical, maybe even as something beyond your
grasp or understanding. But drawing is really an elemental skill, one that you can learn with
no more effort than learning to walk, ride a bike—or even tie your shoes!
Quite simply, drawing is a way of showing others what and how you see. Even at its most
basic stage, drawing is about seeing the miracle of all things, of admiring the essential 
poetry in things. Viewed this way, drawing isn’t any more magical than anything else—
it’s simply part of the larger magic that is life itself.
What Is Drawing?
A way of using lines to convey meaning, drawing is one of the most basic ways to communi-
cate. Today, we know that drawing preceded the written word—and it may have preceded
spoken language as well. For early humans, drawing was as essential a response to life as

knowing which roots were good to eat and which were good to rub on wounds. In prehis-
toric times, drawings were used to
➤Exchange ideas and information.
➤Celebrate and record the details of life.
➤Solve mysteries.
➤Revere and give thanks.
➤Wish and dream.
There’s no magic to drawing—it’s as simple as recording what you see.
Although these drawings were, according to scientists,
very utilitarian in nature, they are considered works of art
by the artistic community, in that the works were done
with “heart”; no two drawings are identical—some
demonstrate more expression than others.
Drawing is …
While you may believe that drawing is only for artists, it’s
really a basic skill like talking, reading, or walking. Once
you’ve learned to draw, in fact, it becomes automatic, 
although—as with any basic skill—the more you practice,
the more you’ll be able to improve on it.

ing what we see by placing lines

Chapter 1 ➤The Pleasures of Seeing and Drawing
The secret of drawing is no secret at all: It’s all about seeing, and
then representing what you see onto the page. In Drawing on the
Right Side of the Brain (New York: Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, 1999),
artist/writer Betty Edwards considers learning to see and draw a
collection of five skills:
1. The perception of edges
2. The perception of spaces
3. The perception of relationships, or sighting
4. The perception of light and shadow, or form
5. The perception of the whole, or the gestalt
The Artist’s Answer
We believe that drawing makes life richer, every single day.
Drawing is a skill that opens up the world, and so it can put you
in touch with the balances and beauties of nature. Drawing and
seeing allow, if not demand, that you live in the moment, see the
now, stop the chatter, and simply look. In the silence while you
look, there is a peace and centering that can transform your life.
As this sketch of ancient
petroglyphs shows, hu-
mans have been using
drawings to communi-
cate for millennia.

Beyond these basic skills are
memory and imagination, which
are used by artists to create new
works and move beyond the be-
ginning skills necessary to learn
to draw. The more you draw, the
more you will progress from see-
ing and drawing line to space,
shape, form, value, weight, light,
shadow, texture, and detail.

Express Yourself
Learning to draw is about learning to see things in a new way. Let’s start by taking apart
your brain. Well, not literally. For now, we’ll just separate it in two.
Scientists now accept that the brain has two hemispheres. You have a rational, logical, ver-
bal, analytical, and sequential way of thinking or processing information, which is on the
left side of your brain, and an intuitive, visual, perceptive, simultaneous, and holistic way,
which is on the right side of your brain. Your left brain processes parts
of things and words, tries to identify and organize, and works to make
sense of things. Your right brain processes the whole, in pictures and re-
lationships between things.
Drawing is a skill that uses right-brain perceptions, which many 
people—especially those in the western world—have difficulty access-
ing. But there are ways of encouraging the right side of the brain to
take over the more dominant left side. These exercises can actually
change the way you see. You can move from being largely verbal and
analytical to being visual and intuitive. And, learning to use your right
brain is the first step in learning to draw.
In the logic-centered western world, you spend most of your life work-
ing on the left side of your brain—a banker, for example. You’re taught
to think cognitively, rationally, and logically. This is fine for many
tasks, but for the more creative and, we think, more rewarding pursuits
in life, you need to cultivate the right side.

The Art of Drawing
We like to think of drawing as a door to the world that many, for one reason or another, don’t
use. This same door opens to the miracle of life and the myriad of rich detail that you can expe-
rience, and is a way into your (and others’) thoughts and emotions. This door is also a window 
to the soul—maybe, for the soul—and so it’s a way beyond the cares and preoccupations of daily
existence to an altered state that is at once a challenge and a rest.
Artist’s Sketchbook
The brain is comprised of two hem-
ispheres, the analytical and logical
left brain and the more intuitive
and holistic right brain. While
Westerners tend to use their left
brains far more, drawing is largely a
function of the right brain.

Chapter 1 ➤The Pleasures of Seeing and Drawing
Why You Draw, and Why Sometimes You Stop Drawing
You learn most of your basic skills when you’re young, so you’re largely unaware of the
time you put in to learn and practice those skills. Some of you may remember learning to
read, especially if it was difficult for you, but most people don’t remember the learning it-
self, once a skill is acquired.
On the other hand, you might remember the learning involved
for skills you learned later, such as learning to ride a bike or learn-
ing to write, or you may remember when you learned to drive a
car. If you ever learned to ski or play the piano, you probably re-
member some of those lessons (and may have some pretty funny
stories to tell, too—we know we do!). What all of these later skills
have in common is that you accepted the necessity of practice and
learning in stages.
For some reason, many seem to think that the skills needed to
draw are more difficult to acquire, especially when they take into
consideration our need as adults to accomplish things quickly.
Maybe the fact that we desire such immediate gratification is pre-
cisely the reason we think we can’t learn to draw. But it’s really no
more difficult than any new skill, and it’s certainly easier—and
safer—than learning to drive a car!
Creativity research suggests that the reason adults are so afraid of
their creativity is that they’re literally afraid of “making a mess.”
By the time you’ve reached adulthood, you’re carrying many more
voices in your head than merely your own; you’ve got your par-
ents, your teachers, your friends, and possibly even your bosses, all
telling you what you’ve done wrong. No wonder you censor your-
self before you even try! In this book, we’re going to help you go
out and play again without those voices telling you there’s a right
and wrong way to do so.
Back to the Drawing Board
Children are more immersed in
the moment, or the now, than
adults, and so it’s easy for them to
draw. Children are less concerned
with judgmental responses to their
efforts, a concern that seems to
develop as we try for greater accu-
racy and specificity as we mature.
In fact, the more we develop our
largely analytical skills, the more
trouble we have drawing. We lose
the spontaneity and joy that sim-
ply making a mess can bring. 
The Art of Drawing
In order to help children learn to develop both sides of their brain rather than just the left, 
educator David Galin suggests three tasks for teachers.
1. Teach to both the left- and right-sided functions: the verbal, symbolic, logical left, and
the visual, relational, holistic right.
2. Teach the ability to use the style of thought best suited to a particular task.
3. Teach the ability to integrate both systems to maximize potential.

Part 1 ➤Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing

Looking Through the Barriers
The ability to draw is really the ability to see—to see what’s really
there, and transfer it to paper. The key is to see as an artist sees.
Artists process visual information differently from the way most
Westerners do. Most are taught a means of processing that’s more suit-
ed to other tasks, so to learn to process (or see) as an artist takes some
practice. Most people get discouraged before they’ve tried very long,
and soon feel they’ll never get there. They then say, “I’ll never learn to
draw,” forgetting that all skills (and drawing, remember, is a skill) take
practice.
Learning How to Look
Learning to draw is really a matter of learning to see—to see 
correctly—and that means a good deal more than merely looking with the
eyes.
—Kimon Nicolaides, The Natural Way to Draw (Boston: Houghton
Mifflin Co., 1990)
In the chapters that follow, we will be encouraging the right side of
your brain to do the work. To help you, we’ll be providing exercises
that will show you how to see what’s before your eyes, without think-
ing much, and to draw what you see. As you practice, it will become
easier and easier for you to do this; you’ll soon be able to switch con-
sciously from left brain to right for the specific purpose of drawing, or
to access your intuitive side just to relax and enjoy it!
Changing from the verbal perception of ideas to the visual perception
of intuition is of tremendous value for more than just drawing. Within
our increasingly high-tech, high-speed, 24/7 world, you’ll discover
great pleasure in just the accomplishment of learning to use your right
brain. At the same time, as you learn to use the right side of your brain
to see and draw, your own innate creativity will become more readily
available to you.
To tap your inventive and creative energy is a great power. You may
feel tremendously energized by the process, whether you draw or

The ability to draw is really the

that!
Back to the Drawing Board
Because of our analytical approach
to thinking, a common belief
among Westerners is that creativity
is limited to artistic endeavors such
as drawing, creative writing, or
musical performance. Nothing
could be further from the truth!
Creativity takes many forms. You
may be someone whose talents lie
in putting others at ease, or you
may take a creative approach to
getting from point A to point B.
What’s important is to let your
right brain do the work; it’s got a
lot to offer, and it’s just waiting
for a cue.
Anyone can draw! This
simple line drawing was
done by a 7-year-old boy
who managed to really

and shapes of a sleeping
dog very accurately, be-
cause he was following
what he could see.

choose another expression, such as writing or music. Even con-
ventional problem solving is enhanced by creative growth.
Drawing is first about seeing, and a few basic skills and supplies
are needed to get started. Then curiosity, energy, and personal in-
terest take the process to its next stage. At the very least, drawing
will enhance your life. At the most, who knows? As your right
brain will be the first to tell you, the possibilities are endless!
Open Up Your Eyes
It is the unexplainable thing in nature that makes me feel the
world is big far beyond my understanding—to understand maybe
by trying to put it into form. To find the feeling of infinity on the
horizon or just over the next hill.
—Georgia O’Keeffe, 1976
So just how do you learn to open up your eyes and see what’s around you? Let’s start by
talking about filters and frames, two imaginary sensory devices that you use every minute
you’re awake.
When you look at any given scene, you filter out all that isn’t important to what you’re
looking at. You don’t read every word on every billboard as you’re driving down the high-
way, for example; this would pull your attention away from the task at hand—driving. At
the same time, you pay little attention to the traffic on the other side of the highway medi-
an. This is framing what you see, and ignoring everything that’s outside the frame.
In Chapter 5, “Finding the View,” we’ll be introducing you to the viewfinder frame, a de-
vice that artists use to do just this. What’s important to remember now is that filtering and
framing are already parts of the way you see every day, so you’ve already taken the first step
to learning to draw.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Filter is the word we use to de-
scribe the process of noticing only
what we need to in any given
scene. A frame is a similar sensory
device, where we ignore what’s
outside of what we want to 
look at.
Drawings can be scenes from every part of your everyday life.

The Gallery of Life
In Appendix A of this book, you’ll find a list of materials you’ll probably want to have on
hand as you read this book. But to begin, even if you have none of the other materials, at
the very least we’d like you to have some blank, unlined paper and a pencil. In fact, go find
those now. Are you back? Congratulations—you’ve just taken the second step in learning to
draw!
Chances are that, right now, you’re sitting in a room in your house, reading this book. Look
up from the book. What do you see? Use your paper and pencil to sketch that image. Don’t
worry that you know nothing about learning to draw—just do the best you can. (Note: We
realized that making a list was very left-brained, so replaced this with a more right-brained
endeavor.)
What did you see? You probably noticed the furnishings in the room, the pictures on the
walls, maybe the titles of some books in a bookcase, or some houseplants that you know by
name. That’s good; you’re seeing what’s in the room you’re in. But now, look again, ignor-
ing all of the things you just drew above. That’s right—look beyond the books and plants.
What do you see now?
What did you see this time? Did you notice a place that needs some touch-up paint on the
wall? Did you see the pattern of your rug or carpet, which you haven’t really noticed since
you first bought it? Maybe you saw a face in the wallpaper that isn’t really there, or your
own face, reflected in the television screen. When you start seeing these details, you’re be-
ginning to see like an artist. Pretty exciting, isn’t it?

Chapter 1 ➤The Pleasures of Seeing and Drawing
Seeing Your Way to Drawing
When you draw, you live in the present. You are always entertained, and you always have
something to do. Your delight in each day and the detail of the world will show you the
power of small things. Drawing makes you see the relationships between things, as well as
the relationship between yourself and the world. You will experience the deep pleasure of
self-expression: I am me. I did this. In addition, you’ll reconnect with your inner child’s joy.
Your drawings will range from learning opportunities to appreciating the wealth of detail in
the world, and from a feeling of connection to the relationships between things to a per-
sonal meditation and response to your own inner being.
Your drawings will be as diverse—and as particular—as your world.

We’d like to share some thoughts for you to take along as you begin your journey toward 
learning to draw.
➤The uniqueness of you—your eyes and mind and soul—is a gift. Use it!
➤Being an artist is like being an athlete. Stay in shape—draw every day.
➤Individuality comes through practice and ongoing observation of detail.

Techniques as Tools of Expression
Beginning in the next chapter, we provide you with exercises that will help you exercise
your “right” to draw. These exercises will show you how to keep your perception in the in-
tuitive mode, by not letting the left, or logical, side take over. For example:
➤We’ll show you how to stop the left side from “doing all the thinking,” which makes
it difficult to just see.
➤We’ll teach you to concentrate on shape and form (right brain), rather than content
(left brain).
➤You’ll learn how to “just look.”
➤You’ll learn to concentrate on shape rather than content—to look at the “big picture.”
➤You’ll experiment with negative space drawing.
You’ll learn how to draw
a variety of things as
you go through the exer-
cises in this book.
In addition, we’ll be providing warm-up exercises to limber up your hand for the job of
transferring what you see to the paper, and to help in the development of your own per-
sonal style and set of preferred marks, from simple lines to crosshatches.
Lastly, throughout this book, you’ll find a series of exercises, ideas, explanations, and tips to
help you try increasingly challenging subjects and develop your own personal method of
drawing. The last page of each chapter will feature “Your Sketchbook Page,” a place where
you can practice what you’ve learned, right on the spot, if you’d like.

Chapter 1 ➤The Pleasures of Seeing and Drawing
Developing a Way of Seeing and Drawing
Among the many pleasures of drawing is a somewhat altered state of consciousness that is
familiar to artists, writers, and musicians—or anyone deeply immersed in a compelling proj-
ect. In this altered state, time just seems to fly by, hours can disappear, and you feel happy
and relaxed, though very concentrated on what you are doing. Some report that this state
feels rather like floating, or an “out-of-body” experience, while others call it being “in-
volved in the moment” or “the now.”
No matter what you choose to call it, certain activities have been found to make it easier to
achieve this state. Music, meditation, walking, skiing, jogging, and driving are just some of
the activities that can induce an altered state of consciousness.
Drawing not only puts you into this lovely place, it requires being there. When the right
side of your brain does the processing, you can truly see, without the analytical side of your
brain telling you what to think. Then, you can see what’s really there: see to draw.
The rest is up to you!
Being in an altered state
of consciousness helps
you see and draw what’s
really there.
The Least You Need to Know
➤You don’t have to be a magician to learn how to draw.
➤Drawing is a way of showing others what and how you see.
➤Logical thinking and analysis are left-brain activities.
➤Drawing is largely a right-brain activity.
➤You can learn to use your right brain more often and more effectively for other
things in life.

➤Copying a complicated drawing
➤Exercises to get you started
To see itself is a creative operation, requiring an effort. Everything that we see in our daily life
is more or less distorted by acquired habits. The effort needed to see things without distortion
takes something very like courage.
—Henri Matisse
Young children live in a wonderful world of direct experience and response, where they
“see” the world without a lot of the logic and analysis that we develop as adults. Instead,
children see as artists do, using the right side of their brains, where pictures are more impor-
tant than language.
In this chapter, you’ll return to your childhood. You’ll rediscover the child’s way of seeing
that you lost as you grew older—and you’ll rediscover the joy of making pictures that come
straight from the right side of your brain.
Free Your Mind, Your Eyes Will Follow
Maybe you’ve always wanted to draw. Or maybe you drew a lot as a child without thinking,
and then grew frustrated as you got older (and more judgmental) and gave it up. The fact is,
when you were a child you were unworried about your drawing—you just did it. Having
everything “correct” didn’t bother you much; you had your own ideas about what you
wanted to draw and that was enough.

Part 1 ➤Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing

Soon, though, education and experience add the powerful left brain to the mix. Somewhere
between the ages of 10 and 12 years old, all that lovely right-brainedness starts to change.
As children learn the necessary skills of language, reading, and mathematics, the analytical
left brain takes over, and they see the world differently. Drawing, which was so easy when
they saw with children’s eyes, becomes a problem, a quandary, and a frustration as they
work with the exacting, judgmental left side of their brains. They struggle for correctness—
and often give up because the joy of drawing has gone.
The Wonders of the Human Brain
Few people realize what an astonishing achievement it is to be able to see at all …. When
one reflects on the number of computations that must have to be carried out before one can
recognize even such an everyday scene as another person crossing the street, one is left with 
a feeling of amazement that such an extraordinary series of detailed operations can be accom-
plished so effortlessly in such a short space of time.
—F.H.C. Crick, winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for discovering the
structure of DNA.
The human brain is an amazing thing, as celebrated in those wonderful words from British
molecular biologist, Francis Crick. It is capable of lightning-fast, complicated computations,
connections, responses, and reactions simultaneously—allowing for amazing feats like walk-
ing and chewing gum, or, more seriously, seeing and drawing.
Just how the brain works and how humans are evolved beyond other species fascinated
early scientists, still does, and probably always will. We know that the brain has two halves
and that the two sides have different functions. For the last 200 years or more, scientists
and surgeons have known that functions that control speech, language, and cognitive
thought are on the left side, and that visual functions are the work of the right side. 
As language, speech, and logical thinking are so crucial to the human race and our sense of
dominance, the left side of the brain has long been considered the stronger, more impor-
tant, dominant side. The right side has been thought to be weaker, less important, maybe
even dispensable.
It has also been long known that the two sides of the brain control physical operations on
the opposite sides of the body. Damage or injury to one side of the brain is reflected in loss
of function on the other side of the body. Damage or injury to one side of the brain is also
reflected in loss of function specific to the skills managed by that side. 
Children draw what
they find interesting,
without worrying about
why or how they’re
drawing it.

Chapter 2 ➤Toward Seeing for Drawing
Are You a Lefty or a Righty?
The main theme to emerge … is that there appear to be two modes of thinking, verbal and
nonverbal, represented rather separately in left and right hemispheres respectively, and that
our educational system, as well as science in general, tends to neglect the nonverbal form of
intellect. What it comes down to is that modern society discriminates against the right hemi-
sphere.
—Roger W. Sperry, 1981 Nobel Prize winner for research that separated and identified func-
tions of the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
It would seem that the notion of the relative dominance of the left
side of the brain has been around for a long, long time. Our language
and the way we refer to things are responses to how we think or feel
about them. Language is full of negative references to anything
“left,” which means left hand and therefore right brain. Right is
right, meaning right hand and the dominant left brain. There is such
prejudice against left-handedness and the left generally—socially, po-
litically, morally, and culturally—and early conceptions and language
reflected that prejudice. This prejudice still goes on today; the right,
the right hand, and the logical left brain overpower the undervalued
left, the left hand, and the more intuitive right brain.
The fact is that the two sides of the brain each have their own jobs,
strengths, and skills. The verbal left side is often dominant, while the
right, nonverbal side responds to feelings and processes infor-mation
differently. While the two sides can work independently or together
for well-rounded response, the left side often takes over—even for
tasks it’s not suited for, like drawing. So when it comes to drawing,
facilitating the “switch” from left to right is the idea, no matter
which hand holds the pencil.
There does seem to be a difference between left- and right-handed
people. Brain function is usually less lateralized in left-handed people
than in right-handed people. Left-handed people tend to process in-
formation on both sides, bilaterally, while right-handed people tend
to process information on one side. Bilateral, left-handed people 
can be more likely to have confusion in some areas, such as reading,
but they are often highly creative people, excelling in art and music.
Among the left-handed, for example, were the brilliant Italian
Renaissance artists, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo.
Up until very recently, being left-handed was so much discouraged
that many left-handed children were forced to become right-handed
when they were very young. Not surprisingly, in addition to confus-
ing their hand dominance, this also confused the bilateral organiza-
tion of their left- and right-brain functions. If you suspect your hands
were “switched at birth,” you may want to try the exercises in this
chapter with each hand.
Back to the Drawing Board
The longstanding bias against the
left has been behind the practice
of insisting that children who are
naturally left-handed learn to
use their right hands. This is a
real mistake. Brain function and
left- or right-handedness are
connected and exist from birth.
Insisting on switching a child’s
hand can cause real problems in
learning, reading, and cognitive
processes. Don’t do it!

Lateralization is the way specif-
ic functions or tasks are handled
by the brain, whether by one
side or the other or both.

Whichever hand you use, you’ll want to learn to “switch” between your left brain and right
brain as you learn to draw. This becomes easier and easier the more you practice, and draw-
ing practice is one of the best exercises to improve your switching function.
From “Logical Left” to “Relational Right”
Pooh looked at his two paws. He knew that one of them was the right, and he knew that
when you had decided which one of them was the right, that the other one was the left, but
he could never remember how to begin.
“Well,” he said slowly ….
—A.A. Milne
Pooh was probably a bilateral type; “a bear of very little brain,” he was a creative thinker,
especially about honey jars and how to get into them. So all you need is a little painless re-
arrangement of your brain function and all will be well. The following exercises are de-
signed to show you, first, the frustration of trying to draw while your mind is seeing with
the “logical left,” and second, the surprising difference that seeing with the “relational
right” will make in your drawing.
Right-Left-Right: Your Brain Learns to Follow Orders
Even in the early exercises, you may notice a change in your state of consciousness—a re-
laxed, focused peace—though you’re trying something very new. Time will pass quickly
while you’re working, and the rest of the world may fade into the background. The right
side, after all, is not a timekeeper.
As a first step toward learning to shift your brain from left to right, let’s begin by exploring
how you drew when you were a child.
The Art of Drawing
Lauren’s mother did her graduate work in dyslexia, and, as part of her studies, tested each of 
her four children for handedness. They came up as one solid righty, an ambidextrous righty, an
ambidextrous lefty, and a solid lefty—a perfect sample range for her study! As the solid righty,
having a seemingly laterally organized brain, Lauren nonetheless finds her typing filled with letter
inversions, one sign of a bilaterally organized brain, common in creative people. She thinks that
she’s a bilateral, right-handed, right-brainer in a left-brained world. Not a pretty sight. At least
her co-author, Lisa, presents a similar picture!

19
Chapter 2 ➤Toward Seeing for Drawing
The Art of the Child
Has your mother kept those boxes of your childhood drawings all these years? Or maybe,
when you moved into your own home, she insisted you put them in your own attic. If you
can find any of your childhood drawings at all, we’d like you to take a look at them now.
So either climb up to your attic, call your mom, or head over to that storage locker and dig
them out.
The Art of Drawing
Why are artists different? The artist’s way of seeing involves the ability to consciously make a mental
shift from the left brain, in which we mostly function, to the reflective right side when they work.
They are used to the more expansive state of consciousness, a somewhat floaty sensation, outside of
time, focused and attentive, but also a peaceful state. This is the way artists see and work.

Okay, ready? Spread your drawings out and consider the following:
➤Can you see where, as a young child, you drew without particular regard for “correct-
ness,” and instead drew to tell a story or as a response to life?
➤Did you draw your family?
➤Can you pick out yourself in the drawings? In Lauren’s, she always has long blonde
hair, an interesting psychological point as she’s always had brown hair—long, but defi-
nitely brown! Lisa always made her eyes very large, and it turns out they’re not partic-
ularly big at all. So wishful thinking probably plays a part as well.
➤Did you find drawings dating from when you were an older child? If so, can you see
evidence of mounting frustration as you tried to draw complicated things or things in
space or perspective? Can you see where you began to struggle for correctness to
please the exacting left side of your brain?
If your mother wasn’t a pack rat, try looking at the drawings of any child. What you’ll no-
tice is how the process of development is almost always the same. As the child grows older,
his or her purely visual response to things is hampered by the ongoing demands of the left
Spread your childhood artwork out and take a look at how your own drawing de-
veloped. Can you see where you moved from not worrying about what was correct
to a more judgmental approach? What difference did it make in your work?

brain as language, identification, and exactness take over and pass judgment on the more
intuitive right-brain responses, particularly drawing.
Here are two of Lauren’s childhood drawings of her family.
Simple Materials to Begin
While your first exercises require only pencil, paper, and some time, we will add more and
more materials as your drawing skills improve. For now, we’d like to introduce you to the
simple materials that will get you started. Think that paper is just paper and a pencil’s just
a pencil? Think again! 
Paper, pencils, eraser, and a place to keep it all—and you’re on your way!
Paper
A pad of drawing or sketching paper (9" × 12" or 11" × 14") is nice to start, but you can also
begin with some sheets of typing, computer, or fax paper. No excuses accepted here; begin
on the backs of envelopes, if you have to. Eventually, you’ll want to explore what the
shelves of your local art supply store have to offer in the way of paper—you’ll be amazed at
the variety!

Part 1 ➤Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing
22
Pencils
Any #2 pencil will work, but if you’re going out for a pad of paper anyway, do yourself a
favor and get some mechanical pencils. In the past, these were used mostly for drafting, but
they’re readily available and are great for drawing. They make a clean,
consistent line that can be varied with pressure. Plus, they never need
sharpening!
Look for a pencil with a smooth barrel that feels good in your hand.
Mechanical pencil leads come with different thicknesses and hard-
nesses; a good choice is a variety of 0.5 leads in a range of hardnesses.
For starters, HB and B will do; they are less smudgy than a standard 
#2 pencil, although a B is more smudgy than an HB.
Mechanical pencil leads are labeled as to thickness and hardness on
their little storage boxes. Check to make sure that the pencil barrel and
thickness of lead correspond. It is handy to have a pencil for each
hardness that you want to use. You can also buy the pencils in a vari-
ety of colors to color code the hardnesses you are using so you know
which is which.
Eraser
A kneaded eraser is best. You may remember this type of eraser from
grammar school days. Like kneaded bread dough, it can be stretched
and pinched into shapes to get at whatever you want to change—even
the smallest line—and should be considered as much of a tool as your
pencils and paper. Don’t settle for less than a good quality kneaded
eraser. It’s the cleanest way to erase—and you’ll be doing lots of eras-
ing! 
Drawing Board
A simple piece of plywood (1/4" – 3/8" thick) with sanded edges and that
fits comfortably on your lap is fine as a drawing board. You can also
buy masonite boards at any art supply store, a place you’ll begin to fre-
quent more and more. The important thing is to have a strong, flat,
hard, smooth surface on which you can work without worrying about
bumps and bruises.
A Few Other Things
Here are a few other art supplies you may want to consider buying now. They’re not ab-
solutely necessary this early on, but you may find them helpful.
➤While you’re up and about, you may want to buy some masking or artist’s tape.
Artist’s tape does less damage to paper than masking tape, but the latter will work if
you’re picking up a few quick supplies along with the groceries and it’s all you can
find.
➤A ruler will often prove helpful. If you haven’t got a ruler, anything that offers a
straight edge will come in handy sooner or later.
➤A few strong clips to hold your work to the board are an alternative to taping and are
handy to have. More on these later.
Try Your Hand
If you live in an area where
there’s a paper specialty store,
you’ll want to stop by at some
point. Take the time to feel the
paper, to note its grain and tex-
ture. There’s more to paper than
meets the eye!
Artist’s Sketchbook
Pencil hardnesses range from
the very hard Hs, which you can
use to make a faint line, to the
very soft Bs, which are smudgier,
ranging from 6H all the way to
6B. Regular pencils are numbered
as to hardness on the point.

Exercises to Get You on the Right Side 
(of the Brain)
So you’ve got your pencil, paper, eraser, and drawing board or hard
surface. It’s time to get over to the right side—of the brain, that is.
We’re going to provide you with two exercises that will help you begin
to see the difference between how the two sides of your brain see, the
classic Profile/Vase-Vase/Profile exercise, and a copying exercise.
Profile/Vase-Vase/Profile
This drawing exercise is used by Betty Edwards and many other art 
educators to demonstrate the difficulty of drawing while the brain is
functioning on its left side. The “logical left” is not helpful when it
comes to visual tasks best given to the “relational right,” as you’ll dis-
cover when you take a stab at the exercise and experience your left
brain trying to perform a right-brain task.
1. First, draw a simple profile, either the example here or an imagi-
nary one.
2. As you draw, think about each part of the profile, naming them
to yourself as you draw: forehead, eyes, nose, upper lip, mouth,
lower lip, and chin.
Try Your Hand
If you go to an art store to pur-
chase your first materials, let your-
self look around and enjoy the
place. Poke into the piles and
boxes. Get acquainted with all the
toys (they are toys, and you will
like playing with them!). Don’t be
afraid to ask questions. Learning
to explore this new territory is an
important aspect of learning to
draw—and it’s fun as well!
Here’s an example of a
profile/vase-vase/profile
drawing. Yours may or
may not resemble this
one.
3. For this exercise to be
most effective, right-
handed people should
work on a left-facing
profile, and left-handed
people should work on a
right-facing profile.

Part 1 ➤Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing
24
4. When you’ve finished drawing the profile, draw a horizontal line at the top and bot-
tom of your profile, moving out from the profile itself.
5. Now, retrace your profile, thinking again about each feature and naming it to yourself
as you draw.
6. Last, switch sides and try to draw the mirror image profile that will make a symmetri-
cal contour drawing of a vase.
Draw a horizontal line
at the top and bottom
of your profile.
Draw a mirror image of
the profile.
Reviewing the Exercise
Did you find this exercise difficult? It may surprise you to learn that most people do. That’s
because the naming of the parts of the profile while drawing gets us thinking on the logical
left, the side of the brain that likes to name and organize everything. It thinks it has it all
figured out: The forehead, eyes, nose, lips, and chin make a profile.
Repeating the names after you drew the horizontal lines on the top and bottom of the pro-
file reinforces the left brain: Yes, that was it—forehead, eyes, nose, lips, and chin, a profile,
all right—even with the lines!
Next, the quick switch to drawing the opposite, mirror-image profile is a problem. The logi-
cal left is confused by the task of repeating the profile backwards. This is a task that requires
sensitivity to shapes and relationships, something the logical left is simply not good at. The
profile is not the same as the other side; in fact, you may have found it difficult to draw it

25
Chapter 2 ➤Toward Seeing for Drawing
at all. Plus, the vase isn’t even symmetrical—something that strikes horror into the heart of
the left brain (if it had a heart!).
You may have tried a tactic or two to complete the profile and make the vase symmetrical.
If that’s the case, how did you do it? Were you confused? Did you settle for a profile that
was different? That would be letting the left side stay in charge of the profile, but the vase
would end up asymmetrical.
Did you ignore the names for the parts and concentrate on the
shapes? Did you concentrate on the vase and try to make the line
symmetrical with the first side? Did you measure or mark the
curves or relationships between the curves? Did you start in the
middle or at the bottom and work backwards? Any of these solu-
tions would have been right-brain approaches to the problem,
paying attention to the visual and not what you thought you
knew.
All right, we admit it: Your first drawing was a set-up, purposely a
“left brainer,” full of identification and names. To match it on the
other, right side required a switch to the visual, to see the shapes
instead of the names. Drawing is easiest when you think the least,
and just see the shapes, without naming them.
The first profile is conceptual and imaginary, drawn from memory,
but naming the parts makes it a left-brain activity. To really draw
as you see, you must be able to make a perceptual or relational
drawing, a right-brain activity. In order to match the shapes, rela-
tionships, and curves on the second side and make the vase sym-
metrical, you must focus your eyes and mind on the first profile 
in order to draw the second—and chances are, your left brain
wouldn’t let you do that.
Try Your Hand
What this exercise asked you to
do was make a shift mentally from
your normal cognitive function—
the left side—that named all the
pieces, to the visual side—the
right side—that cares about the
shapes and the relationship be-
tween them. That’s because the
nonverbal right is better suited for
the business of seeing than the
linguistic left.
The left profile, the first
one drawn, corresponds
to the left side of the
brain; the right profile,
the one copied, draws on
the right side of the
brain.
The ability to switch modes of brain function is the ability to see differently. Once you
master this switching, you’ll find that it’s very handy for all sorts of problem solving in
your daily existence!

When the Familiar Gets Unfamiliar
Now that you’re aware of the difficulty of doing a right-brain task while you’re operating
on the left, let’s try an exercise that helps get you over the fence onto the right side.
We recognize and identify things in our world based on our familiarity with them. We see,
identify, name, categorize, and remember, so we think we “know.” That’s fine for facts:
names, dates, numbers, concepts, and ideas. For seeing and drawing, though, a more flexi-
ble, responsive way of observing is better, because things are not always as they seem.
Mostly, we’re used to seeing things one way, right side up. Our left brain easily identifies an
object and names it for us, and then we know what it is and feel confident and secure.
But the familiar becomes instantly unfamiliar when it’s upside down or backwards. We ex-
pect to see it right side up and are confused when it’s not. Upside-down shapes and rela-
tionships are strange to us because they’re different from the memory we’ve stored from
past experience. Our brain doesn’t like them.
Right Side Up/Upside Down
Here are two exercises to help you see how you feel when the familiar is somehow changed.
Write your name (this is something you’re used to).
➤Now look at it in a mirror—is it hard to read?
➤Look at it upside down. For some, this is even harder to read than a mirror image.
➤Try looking at your signature upside down and backwards. Does it appear to be hiero-
glyphics or a foreign language—or no language at all?

Now, look at yourself in the mirror. This, too, is what you’re used to.
➤Look at a photo of yourself; it will look slightly different because we are all a little
asymmetrical, and the mirror image is the one we’re most familiar with.
➤Look at the photo of yourself upside down. Does this look a little odd to you?
➤Now look at it upside down and in the mirror. This looks even stranger, doesn’t it?

We know our world—or think that we do—because we can identify
and remember. Upside down or backwards, things look a little odd or
even unsettling, particularly faces and handwriting, because they’re
asymmetrical. Our logical left brain is easily confused when our mem-
ory is different from reality, and visual tricks or problems are frustrat-
ing. The organized memory is of no use here and often gives up or
over to the relative right. For us, that’s good news—it’s just what we
want to happen!
Copy a Complicated Drawing
When it comes to a complicated drawing with detail, proportion, and
foreshortening, it can be much easier to copy the image upside down
as forgers do, concentrating on the shapes and relationships rather
than on the drawing itself, which can seem intimidatingly difficult. A
complicated drawing can throw the logical left into complete revolt
and send it packing. That’s the idea behind this exercise—to see with
the relational right.
Try Your Hand
If you need a new career, you
might be interested to know that
forgers practice new signatures up-
side down, to pay more attention
to the shapes of a particular hand
and less to the letters themselves.
You might want to try this even if
you are gainfully employed. Just
don’t try to pass one of those
checks with a forged signature!
Use these images to
practice copying a draw-
ing right side up and up-
side down. 

29
Chapter 2 ➤Toward Seeing for Drawing
1. Select one of the previous images above and copy it right side up.
2. Now, turn the same example image upside down.
3. Begin a new drawing of the upside-down image.
Here are some tips to try as you work on the upside-down image:
➤Concentrate on the shapes, not the image.
➤Don’t try to draw the whole thing first and fill in the detail.
➤Start where you can see a shape and draw it.
➤Think about lines. Which way do they go? Do they curve or stay straight? Where do
they connect to other lines?
➤Where are the horizontals, the verticals? Which way do they go?
➤Compare shapes rather than identify them. How do they relate to others?
➤Work on one area at a time. You can cover most of the example drawing and only
look at the part you are drawing.
➤Resist the temptation to see how you are doing or even think about it.
➤Try not to think at all. Just look and draw what you see.
Keep Up the Good Work
Your second, upside-down drawing should be a significant improvement over the first,
right-side-up one. Problems like scale, proportion, likeness, and detail that were very diffi-
cult right side up are merely shapes and relationships when viewed upside down, and so
they can be observed and drawn easily, one by one.
You may have just done the first drawing that you liked in years by concentrating on
shapes and relationships with the relational right and sending the logical left off to sleep.
Fascinating, isn’t it? Amazing, even—and that’s just the beginning. When you can send the
logical left on vacation at will and concentrate on seeing what’s there rather than what you
thought you knew, you’ll find the door to drawing swing open!

Now that you’ve begun to draw on the relational right, next comes a chapter of contour
drawings, to do first without looking and then while looking. These drawings will help you
further your newfound ability to see as an artist sees, using shape, space, and relationships.
No two right-side-up/upside-down drawings are alike, as these children’s

The Least You Need to Know
➤In daily life we’re taught to function on the analytical, verbal, left side of our brain.
➤An artist, while working, makes a conscious shift in cognitive function from “logical
left” to “relational right.”
➤Learning to draw is really learning to see as an artist does, on the right side of the
brain.
➤Creative thinking and problem solving can be useful in other areas of work and life,
too.

➤Drawing while looking
➤Farewell, left brain!
Drawing is a language without words.
—Harvey Weiss
Now that you’ve practiced switching from your left brain to your right, it’s time to warm up
your relational right for the exercises that follow in the rest of the book. Learning to draw is
like any other skill; it’s about practice, practice, practice—but it’s a fun kind of practice.
To begin your practice, get out your paper and pencils, as well as your artist’s board. In this
chapter, we’re going to doodle the night (or day) away, and bid Old Lefty farewell.
Now You See It
Remember when you were learning to write and the long practice sessions you put in before
you mastered that skill? Your drawing hand also needs practice to make attractive and sensi-
tive marks in reaction to your new awareness and observation. Calligraphers warm up be-
fore they work, to get their hand back into the swing of beautiful writing, and probably our
friends the forgers do, too. So should you.
When practicing Palmer Method writing, try reproducing your signature upside down.
Lauren uses blocks that spell the letters of her name, L A U R E N, which is fairly simple to
copy. If you have any blocks around, whether in the attic or belonging to your children,
you can try this, too. Arrange them upside down and copy the letters—as well as the pic-
tures on them.

Warm-Up for the Eyes and Hand
Just as you may have practiced your penmanship by forming a’s or s’s over and over again,
why not try a page of marks before you start drawing? Practice circles and ovals and ellipses
(a long, skinny oval, often a difficult shape to master). It is good for your hand to do a se-
ries of these, or of graduated sizes, chains of circles, concentric circles, spirals, eggs, bullets,
and even some calculated squiggles.
The Art of Drawing
Are you old enough to remember the Palmer Method? It was once the preferred method of
teaching and practicing penmanship, based on observation of shapes and the practice of letter
shapes, rather like practicing scales when you are learning to play the piano. Generations of
schoolchildren (and the adults they became) can be identified by their careful o’s and w’s—not
to mention their p’s and q’s.
Warm up your hand
with a page of circles,
ovals, spirals, ellipses,
and similar curving
lines.
Next, try practicing other marks or kinds of lines you might find useful to make drawings:
➤Straight
➤Curved

35
Chapter 3 ➤Loosen Up
➤Parallel
➤Crisscrossing or cross-hatching
➤Overlapping
or 
➤Single
➤Smooth
➤Scratchy
➤Wiggly
The separate lists are meant as two possible options of one’s choice of marks. When you
make smooth lines, you don’t pick up the pencil from the page, but make a continuous
smooth line, as opposed to scratchy lines, which require repeated lifting of the pencil. 
Try them all—build up a vocabulary of lines and marks!
Doodle a page of marks
and lines to warm up
your hand as well.
Entering the Flow
If a certain kind of activity, such as painting, becomes the habitual mode of expression, it
may follow that taking up the painting materials and beginning to work with them will act
suggestively and so presently evoke a flight into the higher state.
—Robert Henri

Part 1 ➤Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing
36
One of the wonderful things about drawing is the tendency to move into a different, higher
state of consciousness while working. The attentive, observant right brain focuses on what
you are really seeing, rather than on what your left brain tells you, leaving you open to this
lovely state and place.
Time seems to fade into the distance, and you can experience a rare floating feeling as you
work, removed from the moment-to-moment world. Even music in the background can vir-
tually disappear. Of course, almost any intrusion can swing you to left-brain reality; the
phone ringing is the worst offender, but you can swing yourself back, too, just by seeing 
instead of thinking.
Drawing is a meditation, a way to get in touch with some of your in-
nermost feelings and insights, and a rest from the concerns of our
high-pressure lives.
To Begin 
Before you begin drawing, you’ll want to get yourself in a drawing state
of mind. These steps can help you get yourself there. Because steps are
a left-brained arrangement, you may want to record yourself saying
these steps slowly and then play the recording when you want to arrive
in this state.
1. Arrange yourself and your hand or subject.
2. Close your eyes and meditate for a few moments. Try to clear
your mind of clutter.
3. Sit comfortably, and arrange your paper and board.
4. Relax for a moment. Try to forget about the rest of the world
and the other things you need to do today.
5. Close your eyes for a moment. Breathe slowly and try to let all
that you normally think about pass out of your mind.
6. Concentrate on the moment. Sit comfortably. Open your eyes.
7. Look closely at your subject. Try to see it as if you were looking
at it for the first time.
8. Let your eyes travel around the outside of your object.
9. Try to see all the detail inside the outside shape.
10. Now, focus on a line. See how it curves. Which way? How
long? Which line does it meet? Does it go over or under that
line?
11. Try to see all the lines as special to the whole. Then place your
pencil on the page and begin to draw.
The Next Set—Send Off the 
Logical Left
Here is a drawing exercise to buy an express ticket to send that persist-
ent “logical left” packing. Your left brain will want to leave town, and
not even call or write. Let it go; it is a nuisance.
The Art of Drawing
When practicing marks, try to get
your whole arm involved, not
just your hand. Develop a sense
of your hand, almost suspended
above your paper, with just a
light touch for stability. Let your
arm move your hand as it works
to make the marks. You will find
that your line is smoother and
can reach out further in any di-
rection to follow an edge or
make a shape without becoming
fragmented and scratchy.
Artist’s Sketchbook
A contour drawing is any
drawing in which the lines repre-
sent the edge of a form, shape,
or space; the edge between two
forms, shapes, or spaces; or the
shared edge between groups of
forms, shapes, or spaces.

Chapter 3 ➤Loosen Up
You are going to try a contour drawing of your hand (not the drawing hand, “the other one,”
as Pooh would say). You are going to do this drawing without looking at your paper, not
even once!
This exercise is one developed by Kimon Nicolaides in his book, The Natural Way to Draw
(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1990). It is a way to completely concentrate on what you see,
without looking to check, analyze, and judge your work. In other words, “just do it.” Plan
on about 10 minutes for each part that you try.
Contour Drawing of Your Hand—Without Looking
If you would like to really see what a difference it can make to concentrate on just seeing
and drawing what you see, you can make a drawing of your hand before you start these ex-
ercises. Just do it, to the best of your ability, and set it aside. Then you can compare it to
the second drawing that you do, when you can look again.
1. Start by setting up your area to draw. Your pad of sketch paper on your board and a
pencil will do.
2. Seat yourself in a comfortable chair, angled away from your drawing board.
3. Take a good look at your other hand. Make a bit of a fist so that there are a lot of
wrinkles in your palm.
4. Decide on a place to start on your hand, one of the lines on
your palm, for example.
5. Put your pencil down on your paper. Consider that spot the
same as the spot or line you picked on your hand. Once
you’ve placed your pencil, don’t look at the page again.
6. Look very carefully at the line that goes off from your start-
ing spot.
➤Which way does it go?
➤For how far?
➤Does it curve?
➤How much?
➤Is there another line that it meets?
7. Move your pencil, slowly, in response to what you see.
Remember—don’t look at the page!
8. Look at the lines in your hand one by one as they touch each other and try to draw
exactly those lines that you are looking at.
9. Keep at it. Don’t look!
Remain observant and sensitive to the wealth of linear texture, shape, and proportion in
your hand, and try to put it into your drawing.
Keep working until you have drawn all the lines and shapes in the palm of your hand.
That it won’t look like a hand doesn’t matter. Your absorption in a purely visual task is
what counts. Has your left brain left yet?
Try Your Hand
One way you can gauge your 
absorption and higher state of
consciousness is to set a timer
while you are working on these
exercises. Set it for 5 or 10 min-
utes to start. If the timer goes off
unexpectedly, then, my friend,
you have been off in the void!

Part 1 ➤Drawing and Seeing, Seeing and Drawing

Contour Drawing of Your Hand—While Looking
Now, take a stab at that drawing while looking. Hands as a drawing subject are usually
avoided, but you can actually get a decent drawing if you do just as much looking and 
relating of one line to another as you did in the first exercise.
1. Change your seated position so you can rest your other hand on the table.
2. Take another good look at your hand and the lines in your palm.
3. Pick a place and a line on your hand to start with.
4. Pick a place on your paper to place your pencil and begin your drawing.
Here are some examples of students’ contour drawings without looking.

39
Chapter 3 ➤Loosen Up
5. Make the same careful observations about your hand as before.
➤How far does the first line go?
➤In what direction?
➤Does it curve?
➤Which way?
➤When does it meet another line?
➤Then what happens?
6. Draw what you see, not what you think you see.
7. Work slowly and carefully until you have gone all around your hand and recorded all
the lines that you can see.
Your drawing should have all the sensitivity that you put into the making of it. If you did a
drawing of your hand before you began these exercises, take it out and compare the two.
Your experience drawing without looking (and sending Old Lefty off again) should have
helped with the second drawing of your hand while looking. The more you practice really
seeing and drawing what you see rather than what you think you see, the better your draw-
ings will be.
Here are some student contour drawings, done while looking, for you to ponder.

Another Set to Keep It Gone
The “it,” of course, is that left brain of yours, just waiting for a chance to come back in and
tell you what it thinks about all this drawing stuff. Keep it out of your life for a while. Try
the same exercise, but with a household object, like a corkscrew or a pair of scissors. Pick an
object with a complicated shape that will require the same careful looking and relating to
shapes.
As you see and draw, your own innate creativity will be accessible to you. The specialness of
your eyes and mind is a gift. Use it! You’ll find that the pleasure of simple accomplishment
in a high-tech world is a personal triumph.
Contour Drawing of an Object—Without Looking
If you would like to really see what a difference it can make to concentrate on just seeing
and drawing what you see, you can make a drawing of your object before you start these
exercises. Just do it, to the best of your ability, and set it aside. Then you can compare it to
the second drawing that you do, when you can look again.
1. Start by setting up your area to draw. Your pad of sketch paper on your board and a
pencil will do.
2. Seat yourself in a comfortable chair, angled away from your drawing board.
3. Take a good look at the object that you have chosen. Make sure that you cannot see
the drawing itself as you draw.
4. Decide on a place to start on your object. One of the lines that makes the shape is a
good beginning point.
5. Put your pencil down on your paper and consider that spot the same as the spot or
line you picked on your object. Once you’ve placed your pencil, don’t look at the page
again.
6. Look very carefully at the line that goes off from your starting spot.
➤Which way does it go?
➤For how far?
➤Does it curve?
➤How much?
➤Is there another line that it meets?
7. Move your pencil, slowly, in response to what you see. Remember—don’t look at the
page!
8. Look at the lines in your object, one by one as they touch each other, and try to draw
exactly those lines that you are looking at.
9. Keep at it. Don’t look!
10. Remain observant and sensitive to the wealth of linear texture, shape, and proportion
in your object, and try to put it into your drawing.
11. Keep working until you have drawn all the lines and shapes in your object.
That it won’t look like the object you chose doesn’t matter; your absorption in another
purely visual task is what counts. Has your left brain called home?

Chapter 3 ➤Loosen Up
Contour Drawing of an Object—While Looking
Now, we’d like you try the same drawing, only this time, while looking. Even if it is a com-
plicated object, you can get a decent drawing if you do just as much looking and relating of
one line to another as you did in the other exercises.
The contour drawing while looking should be done with the same focus on seeing the lines,
but you get to follow your drawing hand by looking. Stay focused on what you see.
1. Change your seated position so you can look at the object you are drawing.
2. Take another good look at your object.
3. Pick a place and a line on your object to start with.
4. Pick a place on your paper to place and begin your drawing.
5. Make the same careful observations about your object as 
before.
➤How far does the first line go?
➤In what direction?
➤Does it curve?
➤Which way?
➤When does it meet another line?
➤Then what happens?
6. Draw what you see, not what you think you see.
7. Work slowly and carefully until you have gone all around
your object and recorded all the lines that you can see.
As with your first set of drawings, you’ll find that the more you practice really seeing and
drawing what you see rather than what you think you see, the better your drawings will be.
To tap into your creative energy and realize your potential is a great power, one you can use
for more than just drawing.
You may feel tremendously energized by the process. You can use this creativity to solve
problems of all kinds, by looking at all sides of a problem rather than seeing things in the
usual ordered way. You’ll be able to see the big picture, moving beyond the concepts to the
relationships.
Here are some contour drawings of objects done without looking.
Back to the Drawing Board
Looking while you’re doing the
“blind” contour drawing is just the
chance Old Lefty needs to come
back in and try to tell you what
you’re doing wrong. The point
here is to do a drawing that has
nothing to do with anything—
except seeing the lines.

These exercises should have made Old Lefty head for the hills for good. They also should
also have shown you some beginning practice at seeing and relating shapes and lines,

In the next chapter, we’ll be taking a look at using the plastic picture frame, a surprisingly
simple method of projecting an image onto paper.

It’s time to meet some of the tools of the trade, including the view finder frame and the plastic
picture plane. We’ll show you how to make your own view finder frame and plastic picture plane
to take with you wherever you go, and how to use both of these tools to help with your drawings.
Your first drawings will concentrate on learning to see an object in space, using a contour line to
describe the shapes, and looking at the negative spaces in and around those objects.
If you’ve come this far, you’ve already developed some real drawing skills. Now it’s time to start
thinking about your studio and some more materials for your new work.

➤What is a picture plane?

What the eye can see, the hand can draw.
—Michelangelo
If Michelangelo said it, it is so. If you can learn to really see, you can draw. It’s that simple.
In Chapter 3, “Loosen Up,” drawing the lines that are on your palm was an experience in
learning to really see, by taking the time to see each line in your hand. Drawing is about de-
tail and relation, represented on paper as a direct response to what you see—nothing else—
just what you see. Drawing your hand should have become easier after all that concentrated
seeing!
It may surprise you to learn that artists don’t always draw freehand. There’s even evidence
that, as early as the fifteenth century, artists such as da Vinci may have been using picture
plane-like devices to project images onto paper.
In the next two chapters, we’ll be showing you how to make and use similar devices of your
own. In this chapter, we’ll be discussing the plastic picture plane, and in the next chapter,
the viewfinder frame.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
48
What Is a Picture Plane?
Instead of beginning with a definition, we will explore the picture plane and how to use it to
see even more clearly and easily.
You will need:
➤A piece of Plexiglas 8" × 12". You can get a few pieces. A larger
piece can be handy because you can rest it in your lap and
work on the top half. Try a few sizes. Later in this chapter you
may find the larger piece works better for you.
➤A fine-point permanent marker, like a Sharpy or fine laundry
marker.
➤A fine-point washable marker that will hold a line on the 
plastic.
How to Use a Picture Plane
For a dramatic example, we will begin with that hand of yours. Hands
are good models; you don’t have to pay them much and they are al-
ways available.
1. Place your hand comfortably on a table (keep the Plexiglas and
the washable marker at reach). Scrunch, ball, twist, or turn your
hand into the hardest position you can imagine (or not imag-
ine) drawing. Find a position with a lot of foreshortening—your
fingers coming straight out at you—and imagine trying to get it
to look right. You can add a prop, if you’d like, something diffi-
cult to draw, like scissors or a corkscrew.
2. Uncap the washable marker.
3. Put the piece of Plexiglas on your posing hand, with or without
a prop, and balance everything as best you can.
4. Stay motionless except for your drawing hand.
5. Look through the plastic at your hand. Then look at your hand
as you see it on the plastic.
6. Close one eye and carefully draw exactly what you see directly
on the plastic. Take your time. Draw each line that you can see
of your hand and whatever you are holding.
7. Draw only what you can see on the plastic.
8. Keep going until you have drawn every line you can see.
Shake out that poor modeling hand and take a look at your drawing. A
difficult, foreshortened, even contorted, position of your hand and
whatever you were holding should be clearly visible on the plastic. You
have drawn your hand in drastic foreshortening because you drew only
what you could see on the plastic—the picture plane between you and
your hand.
Back to the Drawing Board
Try out all these items in the art
store where you get the Plexi-
glas. Say we told you to do it!
They may think you’re crazy, but
you don’t really care and you
can consider it the beginning of
building your reputation locally
as an artist. We are all a bit crazy;
it’s part of the fun.
Artist’s Sketchbook
A picture plane is the imaginary
visual plane out in front of your
eyes, turning as you do to look at
the world, as if through a window.
Leone Battista Alberti, a Renaiss-
ance artist, found that he could
easily draw the scene outside his
window by drawing directly on
the glass. He called it “a window
separating the viewer from the
picture itself.” And German
Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer
was inspired by the writings of
Leonardo da Vinci and designed
himself a picture-plane device.

49
Chapter 4 ➤The Picture Plane
If you did it once, you can do it again. Try another. Each one will be easier. Fill your piece
of Plexiglas with drawings of your hand, or start a new piece. Keep the best one or two, and
compare them to the first hand drawings that you did, the drawings of your palm, and the
drawing of your hand after you drew your palm. You should see a change!
A hand drawn on a pic-
ture plane.
Hand drawings done on
Plexiglas can be placed
on a copy machine or
scanner for duplication.
Historical Uses of Drawing Devices
From the High Renaissance’s Albrecht Dürer to the Impressionist’s
Vincent van Gogh, the old masters made good use of various
drawing aids and devices. Mind you, they were still great drafts-
men, but they had their tools, not unlike what we are using.
In reality, the picture plane is a visual concept, an imaginary, clear
surface that is there in front of your face, turning with you wher-
ever you look. What you see, you see on that surface, but in reali-
ty the view extends backwards, from there into the distance.
When you “see” on the picture plane, you visually flatten the dis-
tance between you and what you see. Quite a trick? Not really. It’s
like a photograph, a 3-D view on a 2-D surface. You see the 3-D
image (in space) as you look into the distance, but you see the 2-D
(flat) image of it on the picture plane. You can draw what you see
directly on the plastic picture plane, then eventually on paper.
Easy, huh?
Artist’s Sketchbook
Foreshortening is the illusion
of spatial depth. It is a way to
portray a three-dimensional ob-
ject on a two-dimensional plane
(like piece of paper). The object
appears to project beyond or re-
cede behind the picture plane
by visual distortion.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
50
What you see on the picture plane is magically “flattened.” This is be-
cause the distance between you and what you see and the distances or
space within the subject are foreshortened. 
How a Picture Plane Works 
To get a general idea of how a picture plane works, grab a new piece of
Plexiglas or clean off the one used for the previous exercise if it’s the
only one you have.
1. Hold the piece of Plexiglas evenly in front of your face.
2. Look around the room, at a corner, at a window, at a doorway
to another room. Look at a table from the corner, across or
down the length of it. Look out into the backyard or go look
down the street or up the hill.
All that you can see on the plastic picture plane is drawable, first on
the plastic, and then, when you’ve got the hang of it, directly on
paper.
So, we will start with a few additions to your piece of plastic and set up
for drawing.
Preparing a Plexiglas Picture Plane 
for Drawing
For this exercise, you will need
➤An 8" × 12" piece of Plexiglas.
➤A fine-point permanent marker.
➤A fine-point washable marker that will hold a line on plastic.
➤A ruler.
Try Your Hand
If you want to keep one of your
picture plane drawings as a
record, you can try putting it on
a copy machine or a scanner. Or,
you can place a piece of tracing
paper on the plastic and make a
careful tracing of your drawing.
Artist’s Sketchbook
2-D is an abbreviation for two-
dimensional, having the dimen-
sions of height and width, such
as a flat surface like a piece of
paper. 3-D is an abbreviation for
three-dimensional, having the
dimensions of height, width, and
depth, an object in space.
The Art of Drawing
The development of photography grew out of early experiments with the picture plane and
lenses which were used to project an image down on to a piece of paper, something like a pro-
jector does today. It is now thought that the old masters used projector-like devices to help
capture likeness, complicated perspective, or elaborate detail in their very realistic paintings.
After the development of the camera, artist interest began to move away from perfectly repre-
sented realism to more expressive ways of seeing and painting.

51
Chapter 4 ➤The Picture Plane
To make a grid on your picture plane:
1. Draw diagonal lines from corner to corner on the piece of plastic with the permanent
marker.
2. Measure and draw center lines vertically and horizontally in the center of the plastic.
First, draw a set of diag-
onal lines.
Add horizontal and verti-
cal lines to the diagonals.
3. Measure and draw lines dividing each of the four boxes you now have on the plastic.
The boxes will be 2" × 3" vertical.
Divide each grid into
boxes.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
52
Your drawing will be done on the plastic picture plane with the wash-
able marker. The permanent grid is there to help you see relationally—
that is, how one shape relates to another. It will help you transfer the
drawing to paper when you are finished. Right now, the grid will get
you used to seeing where things are in an image or a drawing, and
eventually you won’t even need it.
Isolate a Subject with the 
Picture Plane
Now you are ready to try one of the drawing devices favored by the old
masters. This is an exercise that will help you get the idea of the picture
plane in your mind’s eye—or is it your eye’s mind?
1. Look around the room and decide on a first subject. Don’t get
too ambitious at first. A corner of a room might be too much;
try a table or a chair, or a window at an angle.
2. It is absolutely necessary that you’re able to keep the plastic
picture plane at your eye level and that it be still. Rest it on a
table, or hold it straight up and down at a level that you can
see through and draw on at the same time.
Back to the Drawing Board
To draw on the plastic picture
plane, you must keep it as mo-
tionless as possible—and you 
mustn’t move either. You’ll be
looking at a single view, and the
hardest thing will be to keep still
enough for that single view to re-
main static. You can try propping
the picture plane on a pillow or
books if it’s a small piece. If it’s 
a larger one, simply set it on 
your lap.
Make sure your picture
plane is even with your
eyes and that it’s resting
straight up and down at
a level you can see your
subject through. Prop it
up on a book or two if
you need to. This is
where a longer piece of
glass might be handy.
3. Once you have situated yourself and your subject, close one eye and take a good long
look through your picture plane, particularly at the parts that would seem hard to
draw, either because of angles, complicated shapes, distortion, detail, or perspective.
Try to get back to just seeing, but really seeing, and just what you can see, not what
you think.
4. See the image through the lines that you put on the picture plane, but try to note
where things are relative to the lines:
➤What part of the image is in the middle?
➤What part is near the diagonal?

53
Chapter 4 ➤The Picture Plane
➤What part is halfway across?
➤On which side of each grid is each part?
➤Does a particular line go from top to bottom or across?
➤Does a curve start in one box and travel to another before it disappears?
➤And then what?
5. Uncap your marker and decide where to start. It should be a shape that you are quite
sure of, one you can use to go to the next shape, one you can see your way from to
where it connects with another. See where it is relative to your grid of lines.
6. Start to draw your subject, line by line. See how one line
goes into another, over or under, curved or straight. The
marker line will be somewhat thicker than a pencil and a lit-
tle wobbly because you are working vertically, but no matter,
just draw what you see.
7. Keep going at it at a nice easy pace, concentrating but not
rushed. You should be having fun now. Are you?
When you have put in all that you see in your object, take a mo-
ment and observe the accuracy with which you have drawn a
complicated drawing. Try to see where the plastic picture plane
made it easy for you to draw a difficult part, like a table in per-
spective, or the scale of two objects, or the detail on the side of a
box, or the pattern of a fabric that was in folds.
These potential problems are no longer problems, once you really
see and really draw what you see.
Do you like your drawing? Would you like to keep it? How about
transferring it to a piece of paper?
Back to the Drawing Board
If all this holding still and seeing
through seems like a lot of re-
quirements, think about those
poor old masters lugging a much
more cumbersome glass version of
a picture-plane drawing device
out into the fields. Then you will
be happy that you have a nice
table to work at—and presumably
a nice cup of hot coffee, thought
by many to be an essential.
Here are some sample drawings done on Plexiglas picture planes.

Transfer the Drawing to Paper
To transfer your picture plane drawing to paper, you will need
➤A piece of paper, preferably 11" × 14".
➤One of those new mechanical pencils, with HB or B lead in it.
➤A kneaded eraser.
➤A ruler.
1. Measure and draw the center vertical and horizontal lines on your paper. A piece of
11" × 14" paper would have a vertical center line at 51/2" and a horizontal at 7".
2. Measure and draw a box that is 8" × 12," centered, or you can put your piece of plastic
directly onto the paper, line up the center vertical and horizontal lines, and trace the
outside edge of the plastic for your box.
3. Draw the diagonals in your box. Then measure and draw the secondary lines to divide
the four boxes, just like the grid. Are you getting the idea of what we are doing?

55
Chapter 4 ➤The Picture Plane
4. Put your drawing on the plastic up in front of you, as vertically 
as possible.
5. Start copying your drawing onto paper, using the grid to see
the relations between things and lines that you drew on the
plastic.
6. Don’t let your mind (Old Lefty!) trick you into drawing any-
thing differently because you’re not on plastic anymore. Don’t
think—just see and draw. Work lightly, and if you get lost, go
back to the grid to see where you should be. It’s fine to erase
when necessary. Keep drawing the lines from the plastic.
7. When you have drawn as much on your paper as you had on
the plastic, take a moment to assess your work.
➤Can you see how the grid helped you to transfer your
drawing from the plastic to the paper?
➤Could you begin to relate one line or shape to another
or to the lines on the grid?
➤Did it help to have the grid to establish distance or rela-
tion between things as you copied your drawing?
8. If you are happy with the pencil drawing, you can add more
to it by looking back at your subject, but make sure that you
draw relative to things that you see—no fudging or filling in
just to fill in. If you can see something to add, fine, otherwise
leave it.
Here are three drawings by three different students transferred from Plexiglas to paper. 
When you’re finished, put your drawing aside to compare later. These exercises can be re-
peated as often as you like; you will only get better at seeing and drawing.
In the next chapter, we will add a viewfinder, another handy item for helping you to see
what is there and to draw it.
The Art of Drawing
Another exercise to try is drawing
an object or a person through a
plate glass door—right on the
door! You’ll be amazed how easy
it is to draw on the glass (don’t
use permanent marker, though).
The subject on the other side will
come out very small unless you
and it are quite close to one an-
other on either side of the glass.
You can adjust yourself and your
subject as you like, of course. And
you can make a tracing on tracing
paper after you’ve gotten the
main lines on glass.

Drawing should suggest and stimulate observation.
Bernice Oehler Figure Sketching, (Pelham NY: Bridgman Publishers, 1926).
Working with the plastic picture plane has shown you 3-D space condensed into a drawable
2-D image on the surface. But it’s also shown you the beginnings of another concept that’s
important to drawing—looking through a frame to see your subject.
In this chapter, we’ll be exploring the concept of a viewfinder frame. Using a viewfinder
isn’t cheating. As artists have known for centuries, it’s a way to help you see spatial relations
and make your drawing more accurate.
A Viewfinder Frame
A viewfinder frame is a simple device that will help you decide on a subject to draw and then
focus on it. As we discussed in Chapter 1, “The Pleasures of Seeing and Drawing,” framing
an image makes it easier to see, and the graduated marks on the edges of the viewfinder
frame give you reference points for relations between lines and shapes, rather like the grid
on the plastic of the picture plane, but requiring more clear seeing on your part.
Seen through a viewfinder frame, the main points of an image can be drawn on paper using
the graduated marks. The important thing is to have the viewfinder frame and your paper
or the box that you draw on it in the same proportion, so that the relative positions and
placement do not change.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw

Making a Viewfinder Frame
A viewfinder can be as simple as your two hands held up to make a frame. Through your
hands, you see only what is framed by them.
You can make a simple
viewfinder using only
your hands.
If you want to use more than just your hands, but don’t feel like leaving home to buy any-
thing, you can make a simple viewfinder frame with two L-shaped pieces of mat board,
shirt cardboard, or even from the sides of a cardboard box.
To make any viewfinder frame, you will need
➤Cardboard or mat board.
➤A ruler, preferably metal that you can cut against.
➤A mat knife or utility knife. You can use scissors but you will
get a better edge with a knife and you will use it constantly as
time goes on.
Got your materials? Okay. Just follow these simple steps to make your
viewfinder frame:
1. Cut pieces of mat board or cardboard into a few sizes for differ-
ent sized windows (10" × 13" for a 6" × 9" window, 12" × 14" 
for an 8" × 10" window, 13" × 16" for a 9" × 12" window, etc).
These are standard proportions, but you can also cut a longer
one (8" × 14" for a 4" × 10" window, or 10" × 16" for a 6" × 12"
window, for example), if you’d like.
2. Measure and draw the diagonals and the center lines as you did
on the plastic picture planes.
Artist’s Sketchbook
A viewfinder frame is a “win-
dow” through which you see an
image and can relate the angles,
lines, shapes, and parts to the
measuring marks on the frame and
to each other. It is as simple as
using your two hands to frame a
view or making a cardboard frame.

61
Chapter 5 ➤Finding the View
3. Measure and cut framing windows in the cardboard, leaving 2" on all sides.
Here are diagonals and
center lines drawn on a
rectangular board.
4. You can choose which proportion frame to use for each drawing. What you see
through the frame will vary according to how close or far away you are from the 
object/view.
Keeping your viewfinder frame and your work in proportion is easy. Diagonals drawn
across a rectangle will extend in proportion out to larger but proportionally equal 
rectangles.
Now we’ve cut a window
in our board.
Here’s a rectangle with a
diagonal that extends out
into larger rectangles.
5. Measure and then lightly draw the center lines on your piece of paper (for 11" × 14",
they will be at 51/2" and 7").

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
62
6. Line up the center lines of your viewfinder frame with the center line of your piece of
paper.
7. Use a long ruler to extend the diagonal lines of the viewfinder frame out onto your
paper.
8. Starting from any corner, anywhere along the diagonal, you
can now draw a rectangle that is larger than the viewfinder
frame but in proportion to it, whatever the proportion of the
paper. Just make sure that all your lines are square.
Another way to create diagonals is to put the viewfinder frame in the
corner of a piece of paper and draw one diagonal out from that corner.
Rectangles drawn from that diagonal will be in proportion to the origi-
nal (the viewfinder frame). You can use this method to decide on the
best-sized piece of paper you want to use for a particular drawing after
you have selected the viewfinder frame.
Eventually, you won’t need to draw a box unless you find that you like
to draw in them.
Extending the diagonal from your viewfinder frame will show you
whether the viewfinder frame and the piece of paper are in proportion
or not. Understanding proportion is worth the time. 
Diagonal lines from the
viewfinder frame extend-
ed out onto the piece of
paper.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Proportion is the comparative 
relation between things; in a rec-
tangle, for example, it’s the com-
parative ratio between the height
and width. Rectangles of different
sizes that are in proportion share
the same ratio in their height and
width.
The Art of Drawing
You can fasten the pieces of cardboard of your viewfinder frame together with paper clips or
brass fasteners in any size or proportion and turn the frame horizontally or vertically. That way, it
will break down and pack easily for outings, which will be handy later. Having a few viewfinder
frames on hand allows you to see the relative differences in proportion and helps in deciding
which works best for a particular image or for a particular paper format.

Chapter 5 ➤Finding the View
Using the Viewfinder Frame
Now that you’ve done all that and made a viewfinder of your own,
let’s try to use the viewfinder frame to make a drawing.
1. Decide on an object; a wooden chair would be a good choice
for this exercise.
2. Position yourself, your drawing materials in front of you and
the chair out in front of you at an angle (45 degrees) so that
you can see the whole chair.
3. Pick a viewfinder frame that surrounds the chair quite closely
on all sides.
4. Draw a proportionally equal rectangle on your paper.
5. Reposition the viewfinder frame until the chair is nicely
framed within the window and spend some time really seeing
the chair through it.
6. Close one eye and do the following:
➤Observe the diagonals and center marks on the viewfind-
er frame.
➤See where the chair fits against the sides of the frame.
➤See where each of the legs touch the floor relative to the
marks on the frame.
➤Where is the top of the chair?
➤Look at the angle of the top of the chair compared to the
top edge of the frame.
7. Begin to draw the chair on your paper in the same place as
you see it in the frame. Use the frame to know where a partic-
ular piece of the chair belongs. Draw what you can see in the
frame—that’s all.
Try Your Hand
By retaining the proportion, a
drawing can be much larger than
the image in the viewfinder
frame—in fact, any size you would
like it to be.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Square is 90 degrees, at right
angles, as in the sides of a rec-
tangle. Measuring carefully off
the center lines helps keep your 
rectangle square.
A simple viewfinder
frame can be made by
fastening two L-shaped
sections of cardboard to-
gether with paper clips.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
64
8. Draw imaginary lines between the feet of the chair and measure
those angles against the sides of the frame. Look at the legs of
the chair and make sure they are vertical.
9. Carefully note the following:
➤Where is the seat?
➤How far from the center horizontal line is it?
➤And the back of the seat? Draw the angle of the sides rela-
tive to the marks on the frame.
10. Add each part of the chair relative to the frame and the rest of
the drawing itself.
11. Add details, like the rungs across the legs, as you can really see
them and relate them to what you have drawn. Take your time.
When you’ve finished, you should have a more accurate drawing of
that chair than you expected. It should be sitting on the floor convinc-
ingly with the legs vertical and the seat looking comfortably level.
Back to the Drawing Board
Work carefully. Each line is de-
pendent on the accurate seeing
and drawing of the line before it.
If you need to correct something,
do it—don’t leave it to haunt you
later. Try to see each part in rela-
tion to the frame and all the
other parts.
Here are some chairs
and a ladder drawn by
students using view-
finder frames for the
first time.

➤The virtues of negative space
➤Learning how to use negative space
➤Drawing negative space
➤Getting negative 
I have learned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen, and that when I start
drawing an ordinary thing, I realize how extraordinary it is, a sheer miracle.
—Frederick Frank, The Zen of Seeing, (New York: Vintage/Random House, 1973)
Let’s be positive about this. In space, “negative” is not a bad thing. This chapter is about
shape and space. Really seeing both of them is a great step in learning to draw. In fact, from
a drawing perspective, you should think of shape and space as interchangeable:
Positive Shape = Negative Space
Positive Space = Negative Shape
Find Your Space
Your brain speaks to you constantly, reminding you of what you know about everything.
That’s fine for tasks that require verbal skills and linear, logical thinking. But seeing and
drawing are visual skills, requiring relational, visual processing of information. And seeing a
concept like negative space is definitely a job for the right side of the brain.
In Chapter 4, “The Picture Plane,” you tried drawing a complicated object in a foreshort-
ened view (fingers pointing at you) on the plastic picture plane. On the surface of the plas-
tic, the 3-D shapes and space of your hand were condensed into two dimensions, and were

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
68
easier to see and draw. In Chapter 5, “Finding the View,” you drew a chair inside the
viewfinder frame and used the marks on the frame to help you establish where all the lines
and shapes were, and how they all related to one another. Both exercises have helped you
to see and draw what you saw, rather than what you thought.
The Virtues of Negative Space
We all have minds full of preconceived ideas about how things are. We
often deal in symbols and abbreviations for things—as long as we can
identify them and they suit our needs.
For seeing and drawing, though, what we think we know is not a help,
but a hindrance. It is Old Lefty butting in to tell what he knows. And
what does he know? Sure, he has the chair in his head—the size of the
seat, the length of the legs (all equal), and the arrangement of all the
other shapes. But when seen at an angle in space, everything is differ-
ent. The seat of a chair is a parallelogram, not a square. The imaginary
line between the four feet is also not a square, but another parallelo-
gram. The shapes and spaces are not equal—you saw that as you drew
your chair with the viewfinder frame. So, as usual, it is best to get Old
Lefty out of the process of seeing and drawing.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Negative space is the area
around an object or objects that
share edges with those objects or
shapes.
Parallelograms.
Learning How to Use Negative Space
Drawing the negative space around an object is a great way to send Old Lefty off again.
Why? Because you, and particularly Old Lefty, don’t know anything about those spaces.
Certainly you have no memory or preconceived notions of them; you have probably never
even looked at them. But they are there all right, and they can be mighty handy as guides
to seeing and drawing.
For now, those spaces will confuse Old Lefty, and that’s what we want. And because you
will get no help from Old Lefty, you are free to see—really see—and then, to draw what you
see. Once you try it, you will realize that there is something strangely liberating about
drawing what isn’t there instead of what is. You’ll be wondering what is and what isn’t, and
that’s not a bad thing.

69
Chapter 6 ➤Negative Space as a Positive Tool
Select an Object to Draw: They’re
Everywhere!
So, let’s start with another chair. Pick a rocking chair, or an arm-
chair with curves, or a stool, or a canvas beach chair, or a table
with crossbars underneath, or a stepladder—something with
spaces within it. Objects like this are everywhere, so you shouldn’t
have any trouble finding one to draw.
Remember to position yourself properly—materials near at hand,
your subject out where you can see it, and your paper in front of
you. Rather than looking over your working hand, righties should
look to the left and back to your paper, and lefties should look to
the right and back to your paper. All set?
A View Through the Viewfinder
Pick a frame that is close to the proportion of your chosen object
(a tall, thin one for a stepladder or a more square one for a wide
rocker with arms). Adjust yourself so the chair (or whatever) al-
most fills the frame. 
1. Measure and draw (lightly) the center lines and the propor-
tionally equal box from your frame, using the diagonals ex-
tended out from the frame to establish the diagonals on the
paper.
2. Then draw the box, any size along the diagonal that you
want, which will be in proportion with the frame.
3. Your plastic picture plane can come in handy here. Make
sure that the grid matches the proportions of the viewfinder
frame, or draw a new grid to the same proportions. You can
use the plastic picture plane to check yourself as you work.
Back to the Drawing Board
It is our concepts and memories
of things—our habits and our
modes of perception (basically
the realm of the left side of our
brains)—that make seeing and
drawing seem difficult.
Artist’s Sketchbook
A parallelogram is a geometric
shape having four sides. Each pair
of opposite sides is parallel and
equidistant to each other.
The Art of Drawing
As drawing becomes easier for you, the negative space in a more complicated composition is
even more important. Compelling arrangement of shapes in great paintings is as much the
arrangement of space as shape. The more you see negative space in composition, the better the
composition will be.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
70
Where to Start—Location, Location, Location 
Basically, you start with a spot and a shape—of negative space. Perhaps we can call this a
“spot of space,” a basic shape that you can see, from which you can proceed to the next.
We will base our “seeing” of the negative space on this first “spot of space.”
Remember that it is a “spot of space” somewhere in or around the chair.
1. Hold the viewfinder frame very still and frame the chair in the
window. Rearrange the chair if necessary to see it at an interest-
ing angle. See the relative angles of the seat, the back, and the
legs.
2. Try to pick a spot of space somewhere inside your chair to start,
and really see it. Maybe it is the space between the rungs on
the ladder, or between the slats of the back of a rocking chair.
Close one eye and “see” that spot until it becomes more real
than the chair. You will know when this has happened because
it will pop forward as a spot of space while the chair itself will
fade or recede.
3. Now see where that spot is relative to the grid lines on your
viewfinder frame. You can also look at the spot through your
plastic picture plane to isolate just where it is relative to the
grid. If you choose, you can draw your spot on the plastic first
and then transfer it to the paper after you see how it works.
Or, you can do your “seeing” through the grid on the plastic
and draw the negative spots of space on your paper; it will be a
little easier to see where the spots of space are on the plastic
grid.
Draw the spaces between
your chair and the edges
of the frame and all 
the spaces within the
chair itself—a study in
relativity. You’ll see.
Back to the Drawing Board
Drawing in, and being sensitive
to, a format such as negative
space is a common problem in
beginning drawings. The concen-
tration and focus are on the ob-
ject and the background is filled
in later. But this method often
results in the image being poorly
placed on the page. No consid-
eration is given to the siting of
the object on the page, and the
negative space around the object
is not part of the arrangement.
Usually, it’s not considered at all!

71
Chapter 6 ➤Negative Space as a Positive Tool
4. Either way, use the grid on your paper to draw the first spot of space on the paper.
5. Think relatively and relationally. Try to see where your spot is relative to the marks on
the frame, the grid on the plastic, and the light lines on the paper.
Draw the Holes, not the Thing
Check your spot of space shape and the lines that make it, the angle, whether they curve or
not, which way, and how far. Check again against the frame. Even if your drawing is larger
than the frame, the two are in proportion, so all the relative positions will be the same.
Now, stay focused on the space. As for the chair … forget about it!
Keep one eye closed and find your next spot of space. Find the
shape of that spot by seeing it relative to your grid marks. Draw
the holes, not the thing.
Here are some things to consider as you draw the negative space:
➤Try to not think about the chair itself. Think about compar-
ing the shapes of the negative space and the edges of those
shapes. Are the lines horizontal or vertical? If they aren’t, try
to see the angle relative to horizontal or vertical and draw
what you see.
➤Gauge any shape—its lines and angles, curves, or lengths—by
seeing it relative to the horizontals, verticals, and diagonals.
Begin to see new shapes of negative space relative to the ones
you have already drawn.
➤Draw each new space shape as you can see it. Work carefully,
checking each new shape, and remember that they are all in
relation to each other.
Holding the viewfinder
very still, frame the
chair within it so that
there is an interesting
angle.
Try Your Hand
If you are confused, you can
take a moment and look again
through the plastic picture
plane. You can draw the shape
of the space there and then
transfer it to paper. If you can
see where it is on the plastic,
draw the shape of that spot of
space on your drawing.

Part 2 ➤Now You Are Ready to Draw
72
➤Don’t think about the chair at all.
➤If you talk to yourself while drawing, talk to yourself about the relationship between
lines and shapes of negative space. Otherwise, don’t talk at all. Enjoy the process of
real visual thinking, just seeing and drawing shapes of negative space that you have
never seen before.
See the Object Through the Space
Around It
As you draw more and more of the negative space shapes, it will be eas-
ier and easier to fit in the remaining ones. The spaces around your
chair will be defining the chair itself!
When you have drawn all the negative spaces on your drawing, check
each one in turn against the chair itself. Make small corrections to the
shapes of the negative spaces as you see them. You can lightly shade
the negative space shapes as you refine them, if you’d like. Your chair
will take turns with the space around it; one will appear positive and
the other negative, then they will flip.
When you are finished, your drawing will be a very different record of
seeing. The chair will come out of the space you have drawn around it.
Back to the Drawing Board
If you get confused or have a
problem, remember to see the
shape relative to the guides—the
marks on the frame, the grid on
the plastic, the grid on your
drawing, and the parts of your
drawing that you are sure of.
Here are some drawings done by Lauren and two students, concentrating on negative space rather than
on the object itself.
Each negative space drawing is another chance to really see rather than think your way
through a drawing. By concentrating on the negative space shapes, you can see relation-
ships that will make drawing difficult things easier. Practice in considering negative space
will steadily improve your ability to select an image, arrange an interesting composition,
place it well on the page, and draw!

Chapter 6 ➤Negative Space as a Positive Tool
Getting Negative 
Next, try this exercise with a complicated kitchen gadget like an eggbeater or a handheld
can opener. Try a pair of glasses on a table. Try a bicycle for a real challenge. The important
thing is to concentrate on the negative space rather than the object itself.
As you can see, drawing the negative space can make a difficult drawing easy, particularly
when it comes to foreshortening or complicated shapes, because you can focus on the space
to tell you, visually, about the shapes it surrounds. And the more you work on negative
space drawings, the more you’ll develop a heightened perception of negative space, which
will tremendously improve your composition skills as you do more complicated composi-
tions.
In Part 3, “Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw,” we will look at setting up a place

Finding Space and Time
A studio or a place to draw is almost as important as your interest in learning to draw. We
live in a hectic world that’s full of deadlines and responsibilities. A space of your own, how-
ever small and simple, will become a refuge from the rest of your day. You will look forward
to the time you can spend there.
Time alone—to observe, learn, experience, and grow—is often disregarded in the pressure-
ridden careers and lives we lead. Drawing, a visual, meditative, learning experience, can
help you enjoy your time alone. You deserve a space and the time to immerse yourself in a
pastime like drawing.

Setting Up Your Drawing Room or Table
Studios are magical places. They are not like other rooms in a house. While most rooms are
shared spaces, your studio is just for you—even if it’s just a corner of a room. Your studio
will be an intensely personal place, a retreat where you can express yourself in the sur-
roundings, as well as in what you create.
A studio can be a large, expansive space with several work areas, lots of storage, walls of
books, a computer, a sound system, and great light. Or, it can be a sunny end of your
kitchen, the bay window of your dining room, a spare bedroom, or any quiet corner where
you like to sit. Try for good light if you can; a corner with a window and a blank wall will
do nicely. A small space can still be made into a special place for you, and a drawing table,
or any table, is a beginning.
Studio Beautiful 101
The next question is how to furnish your studio. Whether you recruit pieces gathering dust
in your attic or buy all new ones is up to you. The list that follows includes what we con-
sider essentials to a drawing studio, but you can easily get by with far less (at least in the
beginning).
➤An adjustable drawing table and a comfortable office-style chair
are a great start. You can work at an angle by putting a drawing
board in your lap or propping it up with books, but your own
table is a great help. This can help keep you from hunching
over your work. We don’t want any sore backs!
➤An extendable goosenecked architectural lamp will extend the
time you can work on overcast days and into the evening.
➤A small freestanding bookshelf will hold your materials, books,
magazines, and your portfolio.
➤Supply carts on wheels, called taborets, are a wonderful addi-
tion. They hold everything and you can move them as neces-
sary, which is particularly helpful if you have to condense your
work area when you’re finished for the day.
➤A tackboard is nice if you have a wall to use. You will enjoy
putting up your work, postcards, photos, and other visual ideas.
➤If you have a computer, it can live quite happily on a nearby
table. It can be very handy, as we will discuss in Chapter 25,
“Express Yourself.”
➤A box, such as a file box, big tackle box, toolbox, or photo stor-
age box, will hold your beginning materials.
➤A portfolio or two is a way to keep your work organized and
your paper stored safely. Ideally, portfolios should be kept flat.
A set of paper storage drawers can go on your wish list.
The sky is the limit with studios, but a modest space is better than no
space, and working small is far better than putting off the experience of
learning to see and draw because of a lack of space. Compromise where
you have to; the important thing is procuring a space of your own.
Try Your Hand
Allowing yourself a space and
some time is giving yourself a great
gift. It’s a way of valuing yourself,
thinking seriously about your in-
terest in drawing, and making an
effort to encourage yourself.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Artists’ studios range from con-
verted closets to converted guest
houses. Where you put your studio
depends on where you have room,
of course, but you can make it as
individualized as you choose.

We know you may be limited by your budget, so you should consider everything in this section
as suggestions. Even with a limited budget, however, a weekend at yard sales or even browsing
through your local thrift shops can yield some surprising bargains that you’ll treasure because you
yourself found them.

The Best Time to Draw
The best time to draw is anytime—at least anytime you can manage to escape your other re-
sponsibilities for a while. Quiet helps, as does a little soft music. As you develop your ability
to focus on your work, distractions seem to vanish, but try for a quiet time. Maybe you’ll
have to get up an hour earlier than usual to find that quiet time, or maybe it will be the
hour or so in the evening when you can pass on the sitcoms and do some drawing instead.
During the week, your lunch break at work can be a time to draw. A small sketchbook, one
pencil, and an eraser that you can carry with you is all you need—you never know what
will catch your attention. You can eat your lunch with one hand, can’t you?
Our weekends, such as they are, are often more filled with activities and responsibilities
than the workweek, but try for an hour or so of time for yourself on weekends, too. That
hour before a Saturday night date night, for example, can be a great time to go off by your-
self and draw.
Vacations and business trips are other great drawing opportunities. Planes, trains, and buses
are filled with faces to try. Boats are filled with interesting places and shapes. If you are din-
ing alone, you can draw the dining room, rather than just look out at it. Even a hotel room
may have something to draw.
Anywhere away from home is interesting in some way. The flowers, plants, landscape, and
architecture of a foreign or exotic place are always compelling. Drawing in a sketchbook or
journal will remind you of your trip in a different, more personal way than photos from a
camera will.

83
Chapter 7 ➤A Room of Your Own
What About Drawing Classes?
Drawing classes, like any classes, are an additional opportunity to learn. The commitment
you make to a class can help you focus your attention and prioritize your time.
Drawing classes are everywhere. High school continuing education
classes, community college classes, art museum classes, and small
privately organized classes with local artists are some of your op-
tions. If you develop an interest in a specific medium, a good class
can help a great deal, providing special instruction or access to dif-
ferent materials and techniques. Investigate your options, and ask
around to find out if a friend has enjoyed a particular class.
You can also organize your own group with or without a teacher.
You and your friends can take turns running the group or you can
work independently. You can meet and work together at some-
one’s studio, a friend’s garden, a park, a zoo, a public garden, or in
a natural science or art museum. The camaraderie is fun, the com-
mitment you make to the group helps you to make the time, you
can all learn from each other, and, best of all, it is free.
Beginning Materials You’ll Need
Good art materials are a tremendous pleasure, but don’t feel you have to break the bank to
begin. You can start out with just a few basics. No excuses here!
On Paper
Your choice of paper is somewhat dictated by your budget. Art stores and specialty paper
shops offer a dazzling array of choices, but a pad or two of good vellum surface drawing
paper is all you really need.
There are many other types of paper to choose from as well. Here are some of the plusses
and minuses of each.
Try Your Hand
The important thing is time
that’s all your own—no kids, no
phone, no spousal interruptions.
Make it clear to the others in
your household that this time is
yours, and they’ll soon be asking
for their special times as well!
You can draw anything, anywhere, anytime, as these journal drawings show.

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
84
➤Newsprint is thin, shiny, and not very rewarding as surfaces go.
➤General drawing paper in pads or sketchbooks is a better surface, but not too precious.
You will go through a lot of it.
➤Bristol board in pads is a bit heavier. The vellum finish is pleasant to work on and it
can stand up to an ink line, ink wash, or water-soluble pencils.
➤Watercolor paper, in pads, blocks (pads with adhesive on all sides to keep it flat while
you are working), or individual sheets, is more expensive but worth it later on for your
finished work. A 90-lb. or 140-lb. hot-pressed paper is a good choice.
Paper surface varies as well.
➤Drawing paper comes in plate (shiny) and vellum (smooth) 
surfaces. The vellum surface is nicer for pencil drawing.
➤Watercolor and print paper surfaces are hot press, cold press,
and rough. Think of an iron and you will remember which is
which. A hot iron will press out more wrinkles, and so it is with
paper. Hot press is smooth and silky, great for pencil line and
tone. Cold-press papers have a texture (like wrinkles) and take
drawing material differently. Experiment—it’s the only way to
know which you like best. Rough-surfaced paper is very bumpy
and will show itself through almost any drawing media.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Vellum surface drawing paper
has a velvety soft finish that feels
good as you draw, and it can
handle a fair amount of erasing.
The Art of Drawing
Paper’s thickness is labeled by its weight. Typing paper is 24 lb.; good heavyweight computer
ink-jet paper is 30–36 lb.; drawing paper and printer’s cover stock are about 60 lb.; good draw-
ing, pastel, charcoal, and watercolor paper range from 70–lb. all the way to 300-lb. paper that
can stand on end, with 90 to 140 lb. being the mid-range.
Drawing Instruments
Pencils are best for beginning drawings; they’re both simple and correctable. As we dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, “Loosen Up,” pencils come in hardnesses from very hard technical
pencils in the H range, to very soft, smudgy pencils in the B range. They are labeled at the
end of the pencil (4H, 3H, 2H, H, HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B). School or regular pencils are 2HB,
rather on the smudgy side.
➤Mechanical pencils, once used only for drafting and architectural drawing, are fine
tools. They maintain a consistent though variable line and never need sharpening.
The leads must match the pencil in thickness, and 0.5 leads and pencils make fine
lines. As the pencil barrels are not labeled, you can buy a few colors and color code

85
Chapter 7 ➤A Room of Your Own
your choice of leads. They cost about $1.50 each, so make sure you like the feel of the
barrel in your hand. Try to acquire at least 2H, H, HB, B, and 2B for a range of tonal
color.
➤Erasers are important tools. A kneaded eraser can be twisted and worked into small
points to get at a little corner—and they can be kept clean by stretching and folding
for a new surface. They erase without scratching or damaging the paper surface.
Experiment with the pink, white, and gum erasers, too.
➤Charcoal pencils, charcoal, and conte crayons all make their own tones and textures,
but the medium can be preoccupying at first. Ink, inkpens, brushes, and water-soluble
pencils, we will leave for later.
➤Boards are handy, but the stiff back of a drawing pad or a sketchbook can take the
place of a board, if you don’t have one. Boards can help keep your work at an angle
because you can put them in your lap with the paper taped at a good working height,
and they are more stable than cardboard. Plywood, 3/8-inch thick with sanded edges, is
easy to find. Art stores sell masonite boards in various sizes. Buy a board somewhat
bigger than your paper.
Tools of the trade: draw-
ing boards and journals.
Storing Your Materials and Work
If you don’t have that big studio with stacks of paper drawers, a few simple portfolios will
do. Store your individual sheets of paper in one and your finished work in another. You can
make simple portfolios out of scored and folded corrugated cardboard, or even incorporate
duct tape hinges. It’s not necessary to sign each piece, but if you do, make it small and
neat, in the lower right-hand corner, and straight, please. A date is more useful, so you can
see your progress. That pin-up board is a nice idea, too, for your own exhibit.
Beginning Techniques to Use
Practice makes perfect, but it’s fun, too. Once you’ve got your studio space organized, you’ll
want to warm it up with some work as well. Let’s look at some beginning techniques that
will help you make your studio feel like your own.
The Marks That Can Make a Drawing
The warm-up exercises in Chapter 3 are always good to refer to for artists, calligraphers,
forgers, and you. Take a moment and limber up your drawing hand with some circles,

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
86
curves, spirals, sweeps, swoops, smooth lines, and squiggles, just as you did in Chapter 3.
Then, try some dots, dashes, crosses, hatches, and stripes. Find out which marks you like.
Try to develop a vocabulary as you go along. Drawing is a language without words—but it
does have a vocabulary we will be exploring in later chapters, including terms like tone, tex-
ture, shape, and shadow.
Practice making marks
that please both your
hand and your eye.
In addition, you may want to try cross-hatching in pencil. Try to practice making parallel
lines to tone a part of your drawing. Then, go over them at an angle. Start with a 90-degree
angle, but try others as well—45, 30—and see which you like. Or, try a mixture of angles
over each other for a moiré pattern. It’s less mechanical looking.
Simple Geometric Shapes to Practice
In the next chapters, you will begin to make choices, arrangements, and compositions. You
will see that the world is full of geometric shapes, and that you can use the geometry to
draw things more easily. The more you draw, the more you’ll be trying to see objects in
your drawings as being based on geometric shapes, seen flat or in space.
For now, begin to collect a few simple shapes, such as spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, and
pyramids. Household objects like cans, boxes, tins, fruit, funnels, ice cream cones (empty),
or toy blocks are a few easy ones. See how the shapes look when you look at them straight
on, then turn them at an angle so you see the tops and sides.

87
Chapter 7 ➤A Room of Your Own
Now, try to draw the basic shapes, first flat and then in space. Draw them sitting on a table,
and then hold them up and draw them as if they were floating in the air. This practice with
basic shapes will help you see the geometry in the objects you’ll choose to draw in the next
chapter.
Practice looking at basic
geometric shapes from a
variety of angles, includ-
ing straight on, in space,
on a table, and in the
air.
Practice drawing the
shapes, too. See how the
same shape looks differ-
ent, depending on the
angle?

In This Chapter
➤What to draw? What to draw?
➤Picking your paper
➤Making arrangements
➤Seeing, siting, and sketching
➤You’re on your way!
In order to really see, to see ever deeper, ever more intensely, hence to be fully aware and alive,
that I draw what the Chinese call “The Ten Thousand Things” around me. Drawing is the
discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world.
—Frederick Frank, The Zen of Seeing, (New York: Vintage/Random House, 1973).
Yikes, now what? All set up and nowhere to go? No worries here, let’s just pick an object or
two and begin to draw. You’ve got to start somewhere. Look around your world and redis-
cover it—after all, it’s where you’re most likely to find things you want to draw.
What Are You Going to Draw?
Your house is full of choices, from simple to extremely challenging. You want to start simply
because choosing, arranging, composing on the page, seeing, and drawing will keep you
busy enough for now.
Begin with a leisurely stroll through your house. Look at it as you never have before, really
seeing the things that are there. Think about how objects might look together, like that an-
tique vase you inherited from your great aunt or that postmodern Italian clock left over
from your last relationship. Sometimes the simplest objects can make the most interesting
compositions.

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
92
Select Your Objects and Pick Your Subject 
Pick a few objects as possibilities, and then you can select from the group. Try for interest-
ing shapes, but ones that are basic, geometric, and manageable. Possibilities include
➤Mugs.
➤Cans.
➤Boxes.
➤Vases.
➤A few pieces of fruit.
➤Some veggies.
➤Toy blocks.
Or, if you are feeling really confident, a toy animal, a toy car, or an old
doll might be just the thing.
Make yourself a little collection of possibilities. Put two or three to-
gether. Then try another combination. Look for shapes that comple-
ment each other. Play around until you have made a choice.
Choose the Format and the Paper 
Next, pick a piece of paper to work on, 9" × 12" or 11" × 14", and decide
on a horizontal or vertical orientation. Look at the shapes of the ob-
jects you’ve selected. Are they tall or short? Do they seem to need a
piece of paper that is vertical or horizontal in its orientation?
Back to the Drawing Board
Avoid shapeless objects or ob-
jects with cartoon or caricature
detail. Realistic, accurate detail is
better for learning. Save the ac-
tion figures and cartoon charac-
ters for another time.
You may be familiar
with the idea of vertical
or horizontal paper ori-
entation from your word
processing program,
where it’s called portrait
or landscape. A verti-
cally oriented page is
widest from top to bot-
tom (portrait), while a
horizontally oriented
page is widest across
(landscape).
How Will You Arrange the Objects?
There are always lots of ways to arrange things to draw, and no one way is best, but you
want to make the best choice that you can. Oftentimes, it is the simplest arrangement that
works best, especially if the objects have a lot of detail. Sometimes, a jumble of things cre-
ates an interesting mix of shapes. Later on, in Chapter 10, “Toward the Finish Line,” we’ll

93
Chapter 8 ➤How to Get Started
pay more attention to tone and texture, but for now we will concentrate on arranging, see-
ing, and drawing shapes in relation to each other.
Seeing Arrangement and Composition
Arrangement and composition are the first steps in making a good drawing out of your cho-
sen objects. As you play around and change the combination and arrangement of your 
chosen objects (feel free to change your mind), take time to look at your choice through
one of your viewfinder frames, picking the one that best frames your composition. Turn it
horizontally or vertically to match your arrangement and your paper orientation.
Make sure you have chosen your objects, arrangement, composition, paper size, paper 
orientation, and viewfinder frame so that they all work together. Whew, that’s a lot right
there, but you can do it! When you’ve got everything ready, follow these steps:
1. Lightly draw in the horizontal and vertical center lines on your paper.
2. Place the viewfinder frame on the paper and line up the center lines.
3. Extend the diagonals on the viewfinder frame onto the paper.
4. Draw a box that is proportionally equal to the viewfinder
frame by measuring, or positioning it on the diagonals at
whatever size you wish.
Now you can look at your arrangement through your viewfinder
frame and begin to draw it, in the same proportion to the larger
box on your paper. You can also look at your composition through
a proportionally equal grid on a plastic picture plane to gauge
where things are and where to start.
But the main work of positioning the objects in your drawing
should be done by really seeing your chosen objects as a small
group and then trying to imagine them sitting evenly across the
center lines of your paper. You’ll want to maintain a constant
view, looking at the same spot from the same height. Of course, if
you’ve got to get up, you can draw a line around an object to
mark its place for later.
Look again through your viewfinder frame to see where the center
lines are. See what shapes are right there in the middle. Lightly
sketch the main shapes relative to the center lines.
Remember that objects need to “sit down” where they belong in
your drawing. One way to accomplish this is to imagine them in
the box they came in. Draw the box in space, and then fit the ob-
ject into the box. This works for chairs, tables, boats—really, just
about anything.
See the View and the Distance 
Once you’ve made your arrangement, take a look at it through the
viewfinder frame. Decide on the exact area you will draw. How
you hold the viewfinder frame will determine what you draw and
from what vantage point and distance you draw it. This will affect
the space in your work and around your objects, or the range.
Try Your Hand
In more complicated arrange-
ments, you may want to exclude
some of the elements or some of
the detail. You can “filter out,”
or choose to eliminate what you
don’t want, in order to empha-
size what you do want. The
choice is up to you.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Range is the distance between
you and your objects: close-up
(objects), mid-range (still life), or
far away (landscape).

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
94
Some of the ranges you may consider are:
➤Close-up Range: Objects that fill the frame will look close to you, almost in your face.
Objects in close-up will
fill the frame.
➤Still Life or Mid–Range: Objects drawn smaller in the same frame will look somewhat
farther back, as if on a table.
➤Deep or Landscape Space: Objects drawn smaller, still in the same frame, and placed
toward the top of the frame will seem far away, as if in a landscape space.
Objects at mid-range
will be set farther back.
Objects in deep space
will be seen in the 
distance.

95
Chapter 8 ➤How to Get Started
These different senses of space are fun to play with, but for now, let’s keep to a range some-
where between close-up and still life space and leave the long views for later. Understand-
ing, seeing, and drawing from a particular view and vantage point is
a big step and can seem complicated, but it really isn’t.
Whether you look across at your objects or down on them, and at
what angle, will greatly affect what you see. This makes the differ-
ence between looking at the side of a box or vase or mug and look-
ing into them.
On the Page
First, just see your arrangement from where you are, considering the
following:
➤Can you tell where eye level is?
➤Can you tell if you are looking across at it or down at it?
➤Can you see the tops of things?
➤Or into things?
Probably, you can see somewhat into or over things in your
arrangement. We tend to see across and down at objects on a table,
for example, because we are sitting higher than the table. If we sat
on a higher chair or stool we would be looking down onto the ob-
jects even more.
If you look straight across at your objects, you are looking at eye
level. You will see just the sides or things, but not the tops or bot-
toms.
And if the objects were on a high shelf and you looked up at them,
your view point would be lower than the middle. If the shelf were
glass, you would see the bottoms of things as well.
Try Your Hand
To “see” means looking on the
right side, without letting Old
Lefty help out, to see only what
is there—no thinking in ideas,
only in visual, relational terms.
The Art of Drawing
Most arrangements and still lifes are seen and drawn looking across and slightly down at the ob-
jects, but more radical views can be more interesting. They are also more challenging. Eventually,
you should try drawing at all the different vantage points that you can; you may find you are
particularly fond of an unusual way of seeing things.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Eye level is straight out from
where you are, neither above
nor below the level of your view.
As you move up or down, your
eye level and view change.

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
96
Next Step: Establish Eye Level 
So then, for starters, let’s say that the center horizontal line on your paper is eye level. Hold
your viewfinder frame so that you are looking through the middle of it at your arrange-
ment. Can you tell where the center horizontal line on the viewfinder frame is in your
arrangement? That spot or line is at eye level from where you are seeing your arrangement.
Site the Image on the Paper Using the Center Lines 
Use the lines on your viewfinder frame to decide on eye level in your view, which is called
siting the image. Know whether you are looking down, and try to know how much: a little,
some, more? If you are sitting in a chair, sit on a stool and see the difference, then stand up
and see more of a difference. You can even stand on your chair and look down for a bird’s
eye view.
From a bird’s-eye view to a fly on the wall, the way you look at your arrangement will determine
how it looks on the page.
Making a Simple Contour Drawing
Whatever view you choose, see it through the viewfinder frame and find where the center
lines are, then imagine the view as you see it, centered on the center lines of the box on
your paper.
Then, of course, you just lightly draw it, as you see it. Nothing to it!

97
Chapter 8 ➤How to Get Started
The Lightest Sketch to Begin
So do it now. Use a light pencil, HB or H, and use a light touch. Try to see the basic shapes
in your objects and their relative placement, with or without the aid of the viewfinder
frame or the picture plane.
Don’t worry if you use either of these to check yourself or for help as you practice. You will
use them less and trust yourself more the more drawings you do.
Either way, take the time to check yourself in the beginning. Don’t wait. See the arrange-
ment again through your viewfinder frame and on your drawing.
Check It Over
When you’ve finished, consider the following:
➤Check that the image is centered on your paper with some help from the center lines.
➤Check the view and the vantage point.
➤Look for clues as to your view:
Can you see into or on top of your objects? You are looking down.
Can you see the tops or just the sides of things? You are looking across.
➤Check that you have drawn the shapes of your objects as you see them.
Correct or change any problems you see before you go on.
Correct It Now, Render It Later
Continue to add or refine the lines you draw to say as much about the shape of your ob-
jects as you can. Look for little details in the shapes and make them part of your drawing.
See as much as you can and draw as much as you can see.
When you’re finished, your drawing should be a reasonable representation of the simple
arrangement you chose. It should reflect the choices that you made, including …
➤The objects you picked.
➤The arrangement of them.
➤The frame and the format.
➤The distance from you.
➤The viewpoint and vantage point.
➤Side view, above, below, or partway in between.
In addition, the basic shapes of your objects and their placement relative to each other
should be clear. The detail in the shapes of each should be there. And let’s throw in a bit of
your own personality, response, or uniqueness in the way that you made the drawing.
Now you’ve completed your first real selection and drawing on your own. From here on,
the sky is quite literally the limit. Try a few of these small, simple drawings. Try different
views and ways of framing the view.
In the next chapter, we’ll be taking a closer look at objects and still life composition.

In This Chapter
➤All about still life
➤Why artists love fruits and veggies
➤Filtering and framing your still life
➤Seeing your still life in space
Drawing seems to provide an extra measure of engagement.
—Hannah Hinchman
Artists love to draw the still life—and so will you. In this chapter, we’ll be exploring exactly
what a still life is, and how you can make this most popular of artistic expressions your
own.
What Is a Still Life?
You began drawing your choice of a few basically shaped objects in a simple arrangement.
Drawing from a still life arrangement is an extension of those simple pairings. The space in a
still life is usually rather shallow and the vantage point is fairly close in, while the viewpoint
(seeing from above, the side, or below) can vary quite a bit, for surprising results.
Picking Objects: Classic, Contemporary, and Out There
Not all of the items in a still life need be exactly dead. You can include flowers (cut or pot-
ted), fruit and vegetables, sea shells, seeds, pods, nuts, or leaves. You can include a few “clas-
sic nature mort” items like butterflies, bugs, bones, fish, seafood, skulls, and stuffed animals
(real ones, not your toddler’s bedmate). Human-made items (including pots and pans, an-
tiques, china, baskets, fabric for background color, garden tools, the contents of a drawer,

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
102
your shelf of plants, your bathroom shelf, and your collection of art supplies)—basically
anything with an interesting shape—is worth a look.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Still life, called nature mort (“dead natural things” in French), is a collection and arrangement
of things in a composition.
Vantage point is the place from which you view something, and just exactly what part of that
whole picture, you are choosing to see and draw. It is the place from which you pick your view
from the larger whole, rather like cropping a photograph. If you move, your exact vantage point
changes.
Viewpoint is similar, but think of it as specifically where your eyes are, whether you are looking
up, across, or down at something. Eye level is where you look straight out from that particular
viewpoint. Things in your view are above, at, or below eye level. If you move, your view and eye
level move, too.

103
Chapter 9 ➤Step Up to a Still Life; Composition, Composition, Composition

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
104
You can add sentimental items, such as old lace and china, a baby’s
shoe, or an old hat with ribbons. Even old pictures, photographs in an-
tique frames, and vintage postcards work well in still lifes. You can go
wild and thematic with items from an exotic trip to the Caribbean or
South America or out West. Or you can include a small Adirondack
chair, a willow basket, some pinecones, oak leaves, a toy cabin, and 
a small carved bear. You can go high tech and make a composition 
of your Palm Pilot and your keyboard, or go the sports route and
arrange your sneakers and your tennis racket.
You can reflect your favorite pastime; food, of course, is a great choice
and has been favored by artists over the centuries for the wealth of
shape, color, and texture it provides. A food still life can be classic or
surprising. Fishing tackle, a gardening arrangement, books and pens, a
collection of boxes—you name it, and you can draw it.
Why Artists Love to Draw Fruit and
Vegetables
Objects from nature have been favorites of artists since the early
Renaissance, when painters began paying more attention to their sur-
roundings in their largely religious paintings. The luscious shapes,
vivid colors, and textures in fruit and vegetables are good reasons for
their appeal. They are also apt metaphors for life generally, and add to
any domestic scene.
A Few Thoughts on Composition
Composition is the way you arrange things for a drawing, rather than
accepting them just the way you find them. It includes where you posi-
tion yourself, how much you decide to see, from what position you de-
cide to see it, and how you decide to put the image on the page. While
a lot has been written about composition, experience is still the best
guide. Still, here are some of Lauren’s thoughts on the subject.
Your choice of still life
objects is limited by
only your imagination.
Try Your Hand
Still life items tend to be rather
domestic or household in nature,
but you can push the envelope
and start including unusual things.
Just make sure that you think they
are worth your time to draw.
There are as many possibilities as
you have ideas.
Back to the Drawing Board
Objects with unclear shapes or un-
realistic proportions are not the
best choices for a still life. The idea
is to learn about shape and pro-
portion, so opt for realism, even if
your taste is for the unusual.

Chapter 9 ➤Step Up to a Still Life; Composition, Composition, Composition
Off Center Is Often Better
Arranging things slightly off center relative to your center lines can create a pleasing bal-
ance of elements. Use your viewfinder frame and the center lines on your page. Position the
main objects to the side of center, rather than right in the middle. See if you enjoy the
shapes and spaces this way. Remember to see the negative spaces between things as part of
your composition.
Centering on Purpose
You can choose to center something for emphasis, particularly if it
is also a close-up view. Other times, the symmetrical shapes of
things can be striking if arranged in the center. Just make sure your
choice of objects warrants that decision.
Charming Diagonals
You’ll want to look for diagonals—in life, in landscapes, in other
drawings, in compositions, and, of course, in your own drawings.
Try to see an imaginary triangular shape or two in the relationship
between things in the composition. You will like the change in
your drawing.
Other Shapes to See in the Shapes of Things
As well as seeing triangles in your compositions, which means you have established some
strong diagonals, try to arrange some of your compositions around a strong curve or ellipse.
Note which side of the paper you favor for a strong compositional line or curve. Many of us
are happier with an emphasis on the left side, because many of us are right-handed and so
is our written tradition. Many Eastern compositions are balanced differently.
Try Your Hand
Try to see the compositional
structure when you look at a
painting that you like and try
the same balance in one of your
drawings.
The Art of Drawing
Euclid, a Greek mathematician from the third century, was the author of Elements, a treatise on
early geometry and the concepts of point, line, and plane. His thoughts on design are called the
“Golden Section,” to establish where the central point in a composition should be. He wrote:
“So that the space divided into unequal areas be aesthetically pleasing, one must establish the
same relationship between the smallest part and the largest part, as exists between the largest
part and the whole.”
Basically, this means that a horizontal that is a bit off center and a vertical that is a bit off cen-
ter and the place where they cross that is off center, but in a pleasing amount, is what the eye
seeks. Try it for yourself!

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
106
Composing a Still Life
Composition is really a way to think about your arrangement so that it is as pleasing as pos-
sible after you have gone to the trouble to draw it.
Collect more objects than you did in Chapter 8, “How to Get Started.” Play around with
them until you have narrowed down your options.
Decide on a horizontal or vertical format, using the viewfinder frame if you wish.
Choosing from a Group of Possibilities
Arrange and rearrange the final players until you are pleased. Don’t hesitate to chuck out or
change at the last minute; it’s your choice here.
Filtering and Framing for the View You Want
You can decide to use a jumble of things, but you might want to eliminate or just suggest
some of them. You will get the effect, say, of a drawer full of tools or toys, but call attention
to only some of them.
See your composition through the viewfinder frame that best frames your arrangement.
Space in a Still Life
A good drawing reflects the single view put on paper. You need to see and establish, in your
own mind’s eye, the vantage point and viewpoint from which you are seeing and therefore
drawing your composition.
Vantage and View
Before you begin, you’ll want to explore both the vantage point and
viewpoint. Remember, the vantage point refers to your distance away
from the subject, while the viewpoint refers to the angle at which you
see the subject.
Still life space is usually shallow, so the vantage point is usually in the
mid-range. As you draw more, you can alter your vantage or viewpoint
as you wish. For now, though, let’s stay in middle ground, and save the
bird’s eye views for a little later.
More Work on Eye Level
Eye level is important. Since drawing is putting that single view on
paper, you need to keep a consistent vantage and viewpoint and main-
tain eye level as you work. Check that you can see where eye level is in
your arrangement and on your paper.
Try Your Hand
Cubist artists departed from the
idea of a single view and began
the process of seeing and draw-
ing multiple views as one image.
You can, too, but only after you
can see and draw that single
view.

107
Chapter 9 ➤Step Up to a Still Life; Composition, Composition, Composition
Making Things Sit Down, or Roll Over, and Stay
Your dog may sit and stay, but when it comes to drawing, you have to make things sit and
stay sitting. Objects in a still life have a funny way of not staying quite where you want
them. They seem to slant or tilt, or look crooked or asymmetrical. They fall off the table or
jump out into the air where they don’t belong. You can fix all that with a working knowl-
edge of simple viewpoint and perspective. Accurately drawing objects at the view that you
see them is the way to keep them sitting down.
Ellipses Are Your Friends
A lot of things that you might have chosen to draw are circular, such as cups, mugs, bowls,
vases, plates, and parts of other things. Circles seen in space become ellipses. The relative
fullness or flatness of the ellipse is a function of how high above or how much below the
object you are, whether you can see into it or not, and whether you can see the bottom—or
could, if the table or shelf were glass. Drawing the basic shapes you see in light circles and
ellipses can establish eye level and some roundness to the object from the beginning.

Your practice in warm-up drawings of basic shapes and your practice in drawing basic geo-
metric shapes should have acquainted you with ellipses. Practice more if you need to. Note
how they are flattest near eye level, whether above or below. They get fuller and fuller as
they are further from eye level, so that when you are looking completely into a round ob-
ject, it appears round, too.
Artist’s Sketchbook
An ellipse is a curved geometric shape, different from a circle.
A circle has one central point, from which can be measured its radius, or all the way across for its
diameter. An ellipse has two points that determine its shape and proportion, the farther away
from center the two points are, the flatter the ellipse is.
A 3-D ellipse is called an ellipsoid (something to remember for advantage in Scrabble games)
and is a shape to use when sketching in the fullness of things.
Here are a few simple
objects that Lauren has
drawn above, at, and
below eye level, so you
can see how their ap-
pearance changes. First,

ings.

When a Cube Is a Cube, in Space
Rectangular objects do their own thing in space. Not only are they affected by eye level
(above, at, or below), but they also change as you see them from an angle other than
straight on. As you see a rectangle from an angle, the face or plane that is slanting away

109
Chapter 9 ➤Step Up to a Still Life; Composition, Composition, Composition
from you starts to diminish or vanish. So a plane in space needs to reflect that vanishing as
well as its place relative to eye level.
This is not as hard as it sounds. Again, your practice in drawing basic geometric shapes
should help. Draw more at angles and different eye levels to practice.
Note how this cube in
space starts to diminish
or vanish.
When a Cylinder Is a Rectangle, with Curves
Try seeing and drawing a cylinder as if it were a rectangle in space. Get the angle and eye
level right and then adjust the shape inside. A cylinder has round ends, in space they are
ellipses. You can get the right ellipse by fitting it into the end of the rectangle at the same
angle and eye level.

Fitting Other Shapes into the Boxes They Came In
Most things in your life came in a box. That box sat on the table or the floor before the ob-
ject was taken out of it. It might take a little pushing or prodding, but that object would fit
back inside. Visualize your object inside a box. You can even draw the box in lightly to
make sure it is sitting at the correct angle. Then, simply draw the object inside the box and
you will have it where you want it. Try it!
Try drawing your object in its original box to get it where you want it.
Drawing That Still Life
You already have all the tools to draw your still life, you just need to use them. This more
complicated composition will take more patience, time, and clear seeing, but these are skills
that you now have, right?
See Your Still Life in Space
Sit and see your composition in space, with or without the viewfinder
frame or the plastic picture plane.
Site the Arrangement on the Page
Draw the horizontal and vertical center lines on your paper. You can
use the diagonals of your viewfinder frame to make a box on your
paper that is proportionally equal to the frame. Site the arrangement in
that box on your paper. Then pick a place to start and draw the first
shape.
Try Your Hand
Patience is a virtue, especially in
drawing.

111
Chapter 9 ➤Step Up to a Still Life; Composition, Composition, Composition
Start out with some planning lines in addition to the center hori-
zontal and vertical lines. Make a light set of shapes and lines that
establish placement on the page, position of objects, and amount
of overlap. Try drawing a light set of lines that enclose your com-
position. You can use these lines to judge shapes and spaces
against.
In addition, you may want to check relative heights and widths
against each other. To do this, select a baseline or measurement
that you can consider having a length of “1.” Then, use that meas-
urement to gauge other lengths, widths, curves, shapes, and
spaces. Establish the ratio between the base and any line you
measure against it, such as 1:2, 1:4, 1:5, etc.
Start with a Light Sketch to Position
As usual, you should begin with the lightest line, your H or HB pencil, and a light touch to
draw in the basic shapes and angles and relations between things. Take your time. Don’t
rush. A complicated arrangement takes more time. Consider the following as you begin:
➤Start with the lightest of directional lines for each object.
➤See how they overlap.
➤Try to see each one in its own spot, but relative to the others.
➤Imagine that you have x-ray vision and can see the backs of your objects, where they
touch or are close to one another.
➤Make sure you have left enough space for each.
Check Your Spacing
Don’t go on until you are sure of everything and everything is in its place, and that you
have a place for everything. An object with a shape and size has to have the space in your
drawing that it needs to look three-dimensional. If two objects are in the same three-
dimensional spot in your drawing, they will both look flat. Give them the room they need
to look full.
God is in the details.
—Buckminster Fuller (And he was right.)
See the Detail in Each Object and Draw What You See
When you have located and drawn the shape of each object in your composition, the rest is
clear seeing and drawing of the remaining detail.
Your finished drawing should reflect all the work you have done lately. An arrangement
that you would have thought impossible to draw is now within your grasp. It is a great 
feeling.
In the next chapter, we will look at getting things to look a little more full of volume and
detail. We will look at volume, weight, light, and shadow, and how to draw them by adding
a bit of tone to your line drawing. Detail and still more detail will give your work the com-
plexity that makes it special.

The planning lines in your work
should be light, and need not be
erased later. They can add a vital-
ity and they show the process that
you have been through, too.

In This Chapter
➤Establishing volume and tone
➤Using light and shadow
➤Creating a balance between line and tone
➤Knowing when you are finished
The most obvious reason for drawing disciplines is to train the eye and the hand to instanta-
neous coordinated activity. Artists of the past and present have made countless drawings, not
only as students, but all through their lives.
—Harry Sternberg
You’ve heard the phrase “It’s all in the details.”, and when it comes to drawing, those details
include volume and tone, line and shape, and light and shadow. How do you add those fin-
ishing touches? In this chapter, you’ll find out.
Line and Shape Are in the Lead, Form Follows Close
Behind
For many drawings, a clear, sensitive contour line can say as much as you need to say. You
may enjoy the line quality as it is, feel the shapes and spaces between shapes to be accurate,
and have enough detail to feel your drawing is finished.
In other drawings, it helps to define the form or fullness of things by rendering them with
tone. Light and shade come into play here, and the direction from which an object is light-
ed will determine the play of light upon it, the direction of the shadow it casts, and
whether that shadow is on the object next to it and how much.

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
116
Light and shadow can create strong patterns that are part of your com-
position and can make an object seem more full of volume and weight.
Detail and texture are on the surface of an object, further defining it.
Sometimes they can be confusing when they don’t follow the form. It is
better to concentrate on shape and space first, volume and weight sec-
ond, and light and shadow next, and then detail and texture can follow
along later.
You’ll want to make a graded chart for yourself as a guide for your
range of tones to establish light, shadow, and volume.
1. Measure and draw a box 6" wide and 1" high.
2. Draw a horizontal center line to make two long boxes, 1/2" high.
3. Measure and draw vertical lines at 1" intervals to make six
boxes on the top row and six on the bottom row.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Tone refers to shades between
light and dark, or white and
black, that can be used in draw-
ing to define areas of light and
shadow or render the fullness of
an object.

4. Label the first box on the upper left-hand corner “#1.” (Lefties
can begin in the upper right-hand corner and work left.)
5. Box #1 will stay white.
6. Label the next box #2.
7. Starting with box #2, lightly and evenly shade the rest of the
top line of boxes.
8. Label the next box #3.
9. Start with #3 and evenly shade over the rest for a shade darker
than box #2.
10. Label the next box #4.
11. Begin with it and make another layer of shading over the re-
maining three boxes.
12. Label the next box #5.
13. Begin with it and make another layer of shading.
14. Label the last box #6.
15. Make the final layer of shading in it.
Back to the Drawing Board
If you get ahead of yourself and
get confused between shape and
the detail on the surface, or
confused about what makes vol-
ume and what makes texture,
just take a step back. Sit until
you can see where you are and
what you should do next, includ-
ing a good erasing.

Chapter 10 ➤Toward the Finish Line
You can do this for a six-box tonal scale, or you can make it nine boxes or twelve boxes, as
many as you want. Start with six boxes for now. You have a range from white to light to
medium to dark.
Now, on the lower row, practice matching the various tones you made on the top of the
chart. Start by trying to match the darkest tone. Keep shading it in until it matches the
upper box. Then, try to match one of the light tones, then try to match one of the mid-
tones. Continue until you have matched all the tones of the scale and filled in the bottom
part of the chart.
Here is a filled-in tonal
chart.
In this tonal chart,
we’ve filled in the bot-
tom row of tones to
match the top row.
Your tonal chart gives you an idea of the tonal range that you can use when you are look-
ing at your drawing and deciding how to add tone to it.
The Art of Drawing
You can make tonal charts using a selection of pencils, different hardnesses, particularly if you
like very rich tones. It is important to jot down how you got each set of tones and with which
pencils so that you will be able to use the same technique for building up tone on a drawing.
Try a chart or two with a different range, a light one or a dark one that might not even begin
with white.

Part 3 ➤Starting Out: Learning You Can See and Draw
118
You can make a tonal scale with different textural marks instead of solid tones. Try making
a tonal chart that is made up of different textural marks, keeping them all the same for
each tonal chart so you can see the range of tone easily. Eventually, you will be able to
jump from tone to textural tone and back again while adding whatever tonal value you
want because you will “see” them in your mind’s eye.
Here is a dark tonal
scale.
Here are some circles
with different textural
marks to make the range
of tones. Your own tone
boxes can be in rows of
boxes or looser shapes
filled in with a range of
tone in one texture.
Here are some additional tonal tips to consider:
➤Keep looking at your composition and your tonal scale. See the
shapes that each tone fits into. You’ll have different tones for
highlights on things, the light sides of things, the mid-tones,
the darker sides of things, shadows, shadows across things, and
the darkest cracks and spaces between things. 
➤Get up, walk away, and then come back and look at your work
with fresh eyes. You may see things you missed when you were
sitting right on top of your drawing. Correct any problems you
see.
➤You may want to darken the shade of your darkest tone to in-
crease the contrast between your lights and darks.
➤Half-close your eyes, or let them go out of focus. This can help
you see tone, and then you can work on detail.
➤For practice in form, light, and shadow, try drawing eggs, rocks,
shells, or even mushrooms.
Try Your Hand
The more you practice seeing
and adding tone to an accurate
contour line drawing, you will
begin to do it sooner, as you
move from the planning lines to
the drawing of the shapes, be-
cause you will be able to see line
and tone together.

119
Chapter 10 ➤Toward the Finish Line
Weight Is in the Rear, but Coming Up Fast
Let’s go back to those basic shapes you collected and practiced drawing in space. In Chap-
ter 9, “Step Up to a Still Life: Composition, Composition, Composition,” you drew them as
contour line drawings. Now, try them as toned 3-D objects. Pick objects that are simple and
not too richly colored or patterned for starters.
1. Establish a light source and direction. See how the light plays on the objects. See the
gradation of tone relative to your chart of tonal range.
2. Squint at your arrangement, you will find it easier to see the lights and darks.
Squinting makes it easier to see the tones. It softens detail and blurs the mid-tone so
that you can see the extremes on your tonal scale.
3. Pick the lightest spots like highlights on fruit or the lighted side of a cube or mug.
These areas will be at the light end of your tonal range.
4. Decide on the darkest spots, like spaces between things or a
darker object. These areas will be on the darker end of your
scale of darks. How dark do you want the darks to go?
5. Pick the middle tone between the lightest one and your choice
of the darkest. Try to see that tonal color in your arrangement,
what is halfway between light and dark. This play of light and
dark has a name, naturally: chiaroscuro.
No amount of tonal rendering will make for a sense of weight and
volume if the object drawn doesn’t have enough space to be three-
dimensional. Your careful seeing and drawing of the shape and the
relationships between things must come first. Then, contour line on
flatter items and tone on things with greater weight can suggest the
differences in volume.
First Things First: Shape and Space 
As with tone, light, and shadow, no amount of detail or texture will help a drawing when
the basic shapes and the spatial relationships are not seen and drawn well. When this is the
case, you will waste your time adding detail when you should be correcting the shapes and
spaces.
Similarly, all the rendering in the world will not make an asymmetrical vase symmetrical,
make a bowl sit on the table if it is jumping up, or make two apples look round if they are
so close as to occupy the same space on your page.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is start over. If, after a while, it seems that everything you
add detracts from your drawing rather than enhances it, try, try again may be the route to
take.
Now Start Again 
Pick another arrangement to draw. Choose a few objects that seem to require tone to make
them appear as full as they are. Keep them simple, geometric shapes like fruit, plain boxes,
a cup or mug, or some toy blocks. Try to pick objects that are close in color so the color
won’t be confusing you. Later you can pick objects that require your ability to establish true
color differences using tone.

Chiaroscuro is Italian for light
and shadow. It refers here to a
system of tonal shading to render
an object so it appears three-
dimensional.

1. Make your arrangement and composition. See your composi-
tion through your viewfinder frame. Decide on your paper and
format—horizontal or vertical. Draw a proportionally equal box
on your paper, with very lightly drawn center lines to help site
your composition on the page.
2. Arrange a light source. Look at what it does. Try moving the
light to the other side, the front, or the back, and see what the
light does in each case. Decide which you prefer.
3. Site your view in space and on your paper. Don’t forget the cen-
ter lines, the viewfinder frame, and plastic picture plane as
guides.
4. Make some beginning planning lines, then draw the simplest
shapes, directions, and angles. Measure them against the sides
of your viewfinder frame to see the angles. Lightly draw in the
basic shapes.
5. Check yourself against your composition with the viewfinder
frame and adjust. Work on seeing shapes as spaces.
Pay attention to the negative space shapes. They can help a
great deal in positioning everything correctly. Check again.
6. Work on it; redraw until all of the objects are correctly placed.
7. Refine the shapes and lines to be more expressive. Look at each
item in your composition and say as much about each as you
can.
8. Make a tonal chart on the side of your drawing or on a separate
piece of scrap paper.
9. Try to see each part of your drawing as having a tonal value,
relatively speaking, from the lightest spots to the darkest ones.
10. Look at the light and shadows. Decide on a tonal range that
you will use. Know which pencil will make which tone (this is
where the tonal chart helps). Establish the light parts and the
dark parts.
11. Draw in the shapes of the highlights and the mid-tones and the
shadows. Pay particular attention to how a shadow is reshaped
when it falls on another object. Add the tone to your drawing,
as you see it.
12. Develop the tone on your composition from less to more, based
on your tonal range chart and what you can see. Work on the
drawing as a whole, not just one part at a time. Build up tones
gradually.
You may see problems as you draw, some inconsistency that you
missed. Don’t hesitate to go back and fix it. Remember that your
viewfinder frame and plastic picture plane can help you see your way
through a difficult part.

Chapter 10 ➤Toward the Finish Line
Back to the Drawing Board
Sometimes, as you add a lot of detail, you have to go back and darken the darks for richer con-
trast, or lighten the mid-tones, or enrich the contour lines. Experience is the best guide here.
Building up tone is easy; just keep at it. You can lighten a tone or area that has gotten too dark
by erasing lightly. You can use the eraser as a “blotter” and pick up just a bit of tone without
disturbing the line. The more you draw, the more you will develop a personal sense of style—and
a sense of what suits you and the situation.
Here are some examples of drawings with tone.

Getting to That Finish Line 
Do you see how your shapes now have a sense of volume and they seem to really be there
in space?
As you practice adding tone to an accurate contour line drawing, you will begin to add 
it sooner, after the first planning lines are there to define the shapes and spaces of the com-
position.
Take your time building up tone and balancing the tones in your drawing. It takes patience
and discipline, but you can do it.
You will be pleased with the result, and your drawings will have the added dimension of
volume and weight.
You can use tone as much or as little as you wish. It is your choice, as it is your choice as 
to how much to render, how dark to go, and how to balance the tone and line in your
drawing.
Then, of course, there is the matter of deciding when you are done. You are done when you
have drawn the shapes, spaces, highlights, mid-tones, darks, and shadows in your composi-
tion and balanced all of them for a drawing that describes your arrangement in space. Are
you pleased with your tonal drawing?
As Michelangelo said to the Pope when asked about the ceiling painting for the Sistine
Chapel, “I will be done when I am finished.” Like Michelangelo, you are done when you
are pleased.
In Chapter 11, “At the Finish Line: Are You Ready for More?” we will look at detail and tex-
ture, surface elements that can tell still more about the objects that you draw.

Developing Drawing Skills
Don’t be shocked if your drawings truly surprise you. By now, you’ve developed basic drawing
skills and are eager to practice what you’ve learned.
Before you do, though, we’ll be looking at journals and sketchbooks—yours and those of a few
other artists. Then, because you will need a portable drawing kit to take on the road, we’ll sug-

and see what’s behind those light-filled windows and how they feel about their work.
We’ve put a review chapter next, as a reference. And, we’ll poke around your house and your

After having arranged all things about me in proper order, it is only then that my hand and
my mind respond to one another and move about with perfect freedom.
—A Sung Dynasty Artist, explaining his method
Congratulations! You have moved from early simple contour line drawings that correctly 
reflect the shapes and spaces in an arrangement into the realm of tone, value, light, and
shadow.
As you try more complicated, finished drawings, you can experiment with new materials,
too. Your first work was mostly in the form of exercises. Now, take the time with these more
involved pieces to sample some new, heavier paper or a new drawing tool.
New Materials
Artists are junkies for supplies. Many have a lifelong habit—we collect them, organize them,
play with them, and hoard them. Alternately, we talk about them, share them, and ex-
change ideas about them. Whether it’s paper or drawing tools, half the fun of being an artist
is the “stuff.” In this chapter, we’re going to share some of that fun with you.

New Papers
Who knew there were so many varieties of something as simple as paper? Artists, that’s
who! It’s time for another trip to your local artist’s supply store—this time, to explore the
wonders of paper.
➤Watercolor paper is the stuff that dreams are made of. It’s smooth, heavy, resilient,
able to stand up to almost anything including a bath and a scrub out if necessary—it’s
well worth the investment you’ll make in it. Watercolor paper comes in varying thick-
nesses, from 90 lb. to 140 lb. to mega-heavy 300 lb. The surfaces are hot press
(smooth), cold press (rather a pebbled surface), and rough (very).
You can buy watercolor paper in blocks, pads, or individual
sheets. Take care in cutting down the full sheets. They should
be carefully folded and the folded edge creased until you can
tear at the fold, leaving a soft torn edge.
➤Etching or print paper follows rather the same in kinds as wa-
tercolor paper and is another lovely surface, although some-
what softer and more fragile.
➤Charcoal and pastel papers come in pads or sheets. Both types
come in tones and colors, which can be seen as the mid-tone in
shaded drawings.
More Drawing Tools
Earliest man used pieces of cinder or charred sticks to draw on cave
walls—and things haven’t changed all that much. Artists today rely on
charcoal in a variety of forms, as well as more kinds of pens and pencils
than you can shake a stick at. Some of Lauren’s favorites include:
Assorted artist’s materials. 
Try Your Hand
You can use charcoal to create a
mid-tone, also called a ground
tone, on a sheet of paper by ap-
plying it evenly across the entire
surface. You can then make
darker tones by adding charcoal,
and make lighter tones by eras-
ing out the ground tone.

129
Chapter 11 ➤At the Finish Line: Are You Ready for More?
➤Charcoal pencils, charcoal, paper stomp, and conte crayons all make their own
marks and tones. Each comes in different thicknesses, from stubby and thick to thin
and fine, and each comes in different hardnesses as well, from rather hard (for a soft
medium) to very soft and smudgy.
➤Fixative is sprayed on the surface of an unstable drawing to protect it from unwanted
smudging. It can be worked on after application, and to some extent is reworkable
(you can get under it to change something).
➤Ink, pens, and brushes are very old media, taking over where
charcoal left off. A stick or a clump of animal hair dipped in a
pot of pigmented liquid (including blood, mud, or herbal dye)
made an ink line, while a piece of grass probably served as an
early brush. Today, ink comes water soluble and permanent.
Either can be diluted to make washes of varying tints and
shades.
➤Pens are as personal as the hand that holds them, from reed
and bamboo pens that you can shape to make a particular
line, to crow- and hawk-quill pens, to technical pens for a
very fine line, to all the new micro-point and felt-tip varieties.
You will only know what you like if you buy it, try it, and see
what it does.
➤Water-soluble pencils are wonderful to use; they go any-
where and can handle anything. You can use them for a dry
drawing, or for a watercolor effect. Built-up layers of color or
tone produce rich and sometimes surprising colors.
A pencil sharpener is handy to acquire now if you haven’t already.
A battery-operated one is great for going out into the field (or
stream). If you develop a fondness for water-soluble pencils, a
sharpener will be invaluable, because the points need to be sharp to
make good lines, and stopping to manually sharpen each one slows
you down.
Artist’s Sketchbook
A paper stomp, whether simply
a clumped up paper towel or a
specially purchased one, a Q-tip,
or even a finger can make inter-
esting tones and blurred areas.
Harder lines can be drawn or 
redrawn on top for more defini-
tion. Any unstable surface that
could be smeared if touched must
be protected with a fixative,
which is sprayed on a completed
drawing to protect it after you’ve
finished.
The Art of Drawing
Brushes are just as personal in preference and use. There are wonderful Chinese brushes that
hold a lot of liquid down to fine camel hair that makes the thinnest of lines. Be careful with any
brush. Don’t leave it sitting in water on its bristles. Wash brushes frequently as you use them, and
always keep them flat next to you. If you use a brush for permanent ink, be very sure that you
have cleaned it, or there will be a build-up of ink at the base which will affect its shape. Brushes
are expensive, but buy the best ones you can. By the way, they make great birthday presents for
an artist (hint, hint).

More Techniques
Okay, we’ve talked about supplies. Now, let’s try a few additional tech-
niques that will improve your ability to see and draw the shapes and
spaces in a composition as you add either tone or detail and texture.
Drawing in Circles Is not Going in Circles 
Circles and ellipses can be seen as building blocks or basic shapes for a
lot of objects in composition, because the shapes of all the parts are
what make the whole.
Use circles and ellipses to draw space into things right from the start.
This will help in making sure that you have left enough room for
things. A circle in space is a sphere, or a ball. An ellipse is space is an
ellipsoid, rather like a rounded-off cylinder. Practice drawing them as a
warm-up and practice seeing them in the objects as you draw in the
basic shapes.
You can make a page of
marks or a tonal scale
from any new medium
to test its uses and range
of possibilities.
Back to the Drawing Board
Fancier materials can make a
fancier drawing, but not neces-
sarily a better one. Experiment,
but be sure you remember to see
and draw before you start in
with new tones and textures.

Chapter 11 ➤At the Finish Line: Are You Ready for More?
Scale Is Sizing Things in Space 
Our eyes are wonderful, subtle lenses that work together to give us binocular vision and the
ability to see three-dimensional space. With our eyes, we can gauge how far away things are
when we look at them in space, and see the difference in scale. Even across a room, an ob-
ject is smaller than the same object seen up close. You can see this with a piece of paper
rolled up. Try it:
1. Set an object close to you and another similar object of the
same size across the room.
2. Roll up a piece of paper and look through it at the object
close to you.
3. Adjust the diameter of the roll until it just encloses the ob-
ject.
4. Now, look at the object across the room. Smaller, eh? It is
this difference in scale that you must see and draw to make
three-dimensional space and scale on your two-dimensional
paper.
Remember to draw what you see and that alone. Don’t draw what
you can’t see. Don’t even draw what you think you see—or what
you think you know. 
Measuring Angles in Space 
Remember that the plastic picture plane is an imaginary plane par-
allel to your eyes through which you see the world. Objects that
are parallel to your plastic picture plane appear flat; you are look-
ing straight at a side.
If an object is turned away from you and your plastic picture
plane, it appears to recede into space. The ends of the plane that
slant away from you are smaller than the ends close to you. Those
Every shape has its own
unique geometric equa-
tion. 
Try Your Hand
Seeing the difference in size and
scale is the first step toward
drawing space into your work.

planes are vanishing in space and must be seen and drawn that way. In Chapter 15, “Into
the Garden with Pencils, not Shovels,” we will explain the more formal rules of perspective.
For now, seeing, measuring, and drawing the angles of things will help you put them where
they belong—in space.
The Art of Drawing
You can measure the angles of receding planes against true horizontal or vertical, without using
formal perspective rules.
Hold up your viewfinder frame and see the angle that you need to draw against one of the sides
of the frame. See the slant relative to the horizontal or vertical of the frame and draw the same
relative angle on your drawing. Or, you can hold your pencil up at horizontal or vertical. Look
at the angle you want to draw relative to your pencil, decide on the relative difference between
your pencil and the line you want to draw, and draw it in.
Back to That Race to the Finish Line 
Additional elements that define objects as you are seeing and drawing them are surface de-
tail and texture. Some detail is actually part of an object, structurally or proportionally, but
other detail is more on the surface. Texture is an element that is prima-
rily on the surface and follows the shapes and contours of an object.
Sometimes, the pattern of detail or texture can make it hard to see or
distinguish tonal values that make the object have volume, so it can be
better to get the shapes first, the volume, light and shadow next, and
save the surface detail and texture for last.
When you can see and draw an arrangement and balance the various
elements, you can really begin to draw anything you want, any way
you want.
And It’s Details in the End—by a Hair 
Our world is filled with detail—good, bad, and indifferent. Sometimes,
there is so much extraneous detail in our lives that we need to get away
or simplify it. But in drawing, detail tells more about the objects that
you have chosen to draw.
Choose some objects with surface detail and texture that define them.
Pick objects that appeal to you because of their detail or texture—
remember though, you will have to draw them, so don’t go overboard
at first. Human-made objects are full of interesting detail and texture, 
but you can’t beat Mother Nature for pure inventiveness and variety.
Choose a natural object or two that will require your naturalist’s eye.
The Art of Drawing
Detail and texture are added in-
formation, more or less on the
surface. Detail may have more to
do with the refined shapes in
your objects, while texture may
be critical to really explaining
what you see on your objects.
But the simple shapes come as
spaces first. Until you can draw
them simultaneously and see
line, shape, space, and form, all
of them together, you won’t
truly be drawing.

133
Chapter 11 ➤At the Finish Line: Are You Ready for More?
Take a Closer Look and See the Detail 
When the shapes and spaces in your composition are drawn correctly and you have estab-
lished a tonal range for dealing with the lights and darks that you can see, you can also add
surface detail in line, tone, or texture, or a mix of all three.
Some of your object choices will be rich with surface texture and
detail. To accurately describe that specific quality about an object,
you will need that vocabulary of marks, but only in response to a
real seeing of what is there.
Practice a page of marks similar to the page you created in Chapter
7, “A Room of Your Own.” You can create a tonal chart with any
new mark or texture to see how you can use it to handle tonal
variations or detail that is in both light and shadow.
Nature’s Detail Is Unending 
Why not be a botanist for a day? Pick a branch from a houseplant,
a flowering plant, a flower, something from the florist, or some-
thing from your own garden or backyard.
1. Sit and see the branch or flower as you may have never seen it before.
2. Look at the direction, length, and width of the stem.
3. Look at the arrangement of the leaves on the stem. Are they opposite (across from
each other on the stem) or alternate (one on one side of the stem, one on the other
side of the stem, up the stem)?
4. Look at the shape of the leaves. Think in visual terms—what basic geometric shapes
are similar to the shape of your leaves?
Try Your Hand
Detail is part of why you pick an
object, why it seems to go nicely
with another object. Texture is
the pattern or surface of an ob-
ject and further defines it.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
134
A flowering branch has its own proportion, angles, shapes, and relationships, in
the parts and as a whole, so there is a lot to see and draw.
Practice in seeing proportion in nature is practice in seeing it for anything—as
well as just good practice.

135
Chapter 11 ➤At the Finish Line: Are You Ready for More?
5. Look at how the flowers sit on or hang off their stems.
➤How are they arranged?
➤How big are the blooms relative to the leaves?
➤What general basic shape do the flowers remind you of? Trumpets, flat spheres,
little balls, cones, or what?
6. Flowers are the reproductive organs of their plant. Don’t ignore that, exploit it. See all
the shapes and draw them.
Flower shapes and detail
all have a purpose—
procreation and the at-
traction of those bees,
insects, and humming-
birds that do the work of
pollinating the flower;
drawing the detail tells
us about each individual
purpose as well.
7. Consider the base of the flower in your decision. How do the back and front of the
flower meet?
8. Look at the shapes and sizes of the petals.
➤Are they all alike?
➤Are there pairs of petals? Pairs of three? Maybe five petals, but not all alike?
➤Where do they join the base of the flower?
➤Do they overlap? How much?
The shapes and angles
of petals are as expres-
sive as the parts of the
figure.

At the Finish Line Again
As you draw, see the botanical detail and the biological detail in your objects from nature.
Consider the following:
➤Think visually, mostly of shape and the relationship of the details to each other. Draw
the detail as you see it.
➤Continue to balance your drawing in line, tone, and texture.
The Art of Drawing
The balance of line, shape, space, form, volume, tone, texture, and God’s own detail is ulti-
mately completely personal. No one can tell you what you like and how you should work or
what you should go after. Even we can only suggest what you might still need to work on to be
able to express yourself in drawing without hesitation.

137
Chapter 11 ➤At the Finish Line: Are You Ready for More?
You may prefer a heavily tonal drawing with less detail or you may love the line aspect and
not care about a heavily toned drawing. Experiment and find a balance that is challenging
but personal. Look back frequently at your composition to see if you are capturing the
essence that you were intending.
The finish line is of your own making.

The Journal 
As a Path 
In This Chapter
➤Why keep a sketchbook journal?
➤A journal of your own
➤Different kinds of journals
➤The Zen of meditative drawing
To capture the unmeasurable, you must learn to notice it.
—Hannah Hinchman, A Trail Through Leaves: The Journal as a Path to Place (New York:
W.W. Norton, 1999).
The journal as a path, a sense of place, and the journey to get there are paraphrases from
the title of a lovely book by Hannah Hinchman. Keeping a journal is a great way to record
your thoughts and feelings, your responses, your goals, and your dreams. And a sketchbook
journal is a place to record, describe, or just jot down—in drawings as well as words—where
you have been, are now, and want to go.
In this chapter, we’ll explore the pleasures of keeping a journal of your own, from the why
to the wherefore. In addition, we’ll be sneaking a peek at the journals of working artists,
from Georgia O’Keeffe to some of our friends and neighbors.
Why Keep a Sketchbook Journal?
You can make your journal anything from a mixed bag—including shopping and to-do lists,
if you want—to a separate sketchbook for drawing. Even then, you can annotate your draw-
ings to remind you of details or the feelings you had as you were drawing, or why you
picked the subject you picked. What you were thinking or feeling can get lost in the rush of
busy days, after all, and a journal provides the means to keep those moments with you and
be able to go back to them for inspiration or solace—or to simply remember.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
142
If you decide to keep a sketchbook journal, you’ll be in good company. In the section
below, we’ve gathered the words of some well-known artists from their sketchbook journals.
Artists on Their Work 
I have always been willing to bet on myself—to stand on what I am and can do even when
the world isn’t much with me.
—Georgia O’Keeffe
We’re fortunate that many of the world’s best-known—and best-loved—artists kept journals,
because that means we can let them speak for themselves about how they feel about their
tools, their studios, and their work. Artists, in fact, are quite eloquent when they’re writing
about their passions.
How They Feel About Their Studios and Tools
Perhaps no one’s studio says so much about the artist’s work as that of Georgia O’Keeffe.
Her studio is so large it’s like being outside, which is exactly the feeling one gets from her
works as well. Many of O’Keeffe’s better-known canvasses are quite large, as well—much
larger than life, as was the artist herself.
Corrales, New Mexico, artist Marianna Roussel-Gastemeyer notes that her studio is easy to
find: “Just follow the pottery shards to the door.” Just down the road, another Corrales
artist, Cindy Carnes, has situated her studio to capture the ever-changing face and light on
the Sandia Mountains to the east. (And just down the road from Roussel-Gastemeyer and
Carnes, Lisa types these lines.)
When it comes to tools, artist Frank M. Rines notes in Drawing in Lead Pencil (New York:
Bridgeman Publishing, 1943):
It has been said that a good workman never complains of his tools. Very true, but have you
ever noticed that a good workman never needs to complain, that he always has good tools.
As you’ll recall from previous chapters, we couldn’t agree more: Having the right tools is
half the fun.
How They Feel About Drawing
Writers are at the forefront of those who appreciate drawing. D.H. Lawrence, for example,
once noted, “Art is a form of supremely delicate awareness meaning at oneness, the state of
being at one with the object.” But artists themselves have much to say as well. Here are
some wonderful quotes from artists about the artistic process:
The long, arduous and often painful struggle in seeking truth and beauty requires not only a
deep and passionate love for art, but also a deep and passionate love for life.
—Harry Sternberg, Realistic/Abstract Art (Pittman Pub., 1959)
The goal of the artist is the achievement of the truly creative spirit. It must be earned through
discipline and work. Among other disciplines, drawing is basic.
—Harry Sternberg

143
Chapter 12 ➤The Journal As a Path
I do not like the idea of happiness—it is too momentary—I would say I was always busy and
interested in something—interest has more meaning than the idea of happiness.
There is nothing—no color, no emotion, no idea—that the true artist cannot find a form to ex-
press.
The process, not the end work, is the most important thing for the artist.
To fill a space in a beautiful way—after all everyone has to do just this—make choices in his
daily life, when only buying a cup and saucer.
—Georgia O’Keeffe
Care should be taken to not have more than one center of interest. Extremely important too is
the leaving of white paper. The parts of a drawing that are left white, or in other words, not
rendered, are just as necessary as are the parts that are drawn.
—Frank M. Rines
These—artists of the world—are akin to the scientists only in that their effort is to bring things
near, but even there they part, for the scientist must need to use the telescope or the microscope,
whereas the artist brings them near in sympathy.
—John Marin
The Art of Drawing
Here are Frederick Frank’s “10 Commandments” of drawing:
Source: The Awakened Eye, (New York: Vintage/Random House, 1979).
1. You shall draw everything and every day.
2. You shall not wait for inspiration, for it comes not while you wait but while you work.
3. You shall forget all you think you know and, even more, all you have been taught.
4. You shall not adore your good drawings and promptly forget your bad ones.
5. You shall not draw with exhibitions in mind, nor to please any critic but yourself.
6. You shall trust none but your own eye, and make your hand follow it.
7. You shall consider the mouse you draw as more important than the content of all the 
museums in the world, for … 
8. You shall love the ten thousand things with all your heart and a blade of grass as 
yourself.
9. Let each drawing be your first: a celebration of the eye awakened.
10. You shall worry not about “being of your time,” for you are your time, and it is brief.

The eye that sees is the I experiencing itself in what it sees. It becomes self aware and realizes
that it is an integral part of the great continuum of all that is. It sees things such as they are.
—Frederick Frank
Different Kinds of Journals
Chances are you will end up with a few different journals. Lisa, a writer, keeps one journal in
her nightstand for those random middle-of-the-night flashes of brilliance, another on her
desk to jot down thoughts that have nothing to do with what she’s working on at the mo-
ment, a third by her reading chair, and another in her car (you probably don’t want to be 
on I-25 when Lisa’s recording one of her inspirations in the next lane). And then she has an
additional journal where she copies down great quotes she’s come across in her reading,
snatches of (or entire) poems, and thoughts from other writers she tries to collect in one
place.
When it comes to drawing journals, you may want to try a similar approach. Here are some
of the possibilities.
Travel Journals
You can take a travel sketchbook with you on a trip if it’s small enough to carry easily. In
fact, think of all your traveling art supplies as a kit, which may include
➤A sketchbook.
➤A few pencils and packs of leads (leave the sharpener home).
➤Two erasers (just in case).
➤Small clips to hold your paper in place if it’s windy.
➤Maybe some tape or rubber bands.
➤A few sheets of heavier paper cut to a good size.
➤A lightweight board.
Add things to your travel kit as you see fit, but remember that you will have to carry it to be
able to use it.
Closer to Home 
You will want a larger sketchbook or supply of loose sheets in a port-
folio for drawing close to home. Most of your learning drawing will be
done in these.
If you remember your dreams or have frequent flights of fancy, you
may want to keep a separate expressive journal. Try to make a drawing
that captures or reflects your memory, and write down what you re-
member. You may be surprised at the direction your work takes.
Nonfiction and drawing in a journal combine differently, usually re-
quiring a realistic drawing. They can include a more elaborate travel
journal for a special trip, or a recipe book with all your favorite dishes
and some how-to drawings to explain what you mean or how to
arrange everything—a cookbook in the making.
Try Your Hand
If you are going farther out in
search of yourself, take water
and some food, a jacket, and
maybe a phone. Don’t hesitate
to push the envelope of your
world. Just be a scout about it,
and be prepared.

145
Chapter 12 ➤The Journal As a Path
A gardening journal can be a great sketchbook, where you can record that season’s experi-
ments, problems, triumphs, and notes for next year, as well as all the glorious detail of the
growing season in your special garden.
Other journals could include a fishing journal, or even an exercise or diet journal (draw
what you want to eat, but won’t!).
The Art of Drawing
Poetry, fiction, and drawing could occupy another sketchbook or be one of the ways you use
your general one. Poetry and short fiction (your own or someone else’s) can balance or expand
on a drawing—or the other way around. Entries can be illuminated with realistic or imaginary
and expressive drawings. Early on, you may stick to the business of learning how to draw, but
later you may find that expressive drawing suits you best.
Two pages from a gardening journal: A gardening journal can include sketches of your garden—or dreams
for next year’s garden.

Your Journal Is All About You
There’s nothing like a journal for being yourself. Approach a journal with the understand-
ing that it is yours alone, for you as well as by you. You don’t have to put it under lock and
key, but do let other family members know that you don’t want them to look there. Some
may have trouble with curiosity, of course, so you may want to keep your journal some-
where safe, if you’d rather they didn’t look.
Among the many good things a journal can provide are
➤A sense of self.
➤A sense of place.
➤A sense of purpose.
➤A sense of time.
➤A place to explore ideas and save them for later.
➤A verbal and visual vocabulary.
➤A place to get past first solutions.
➤A place to see the detail past what is predictable.
Using Your Journal
You will learn the most about drawing in your journal by working
from life. You don’t have to follow these steps exactly or even at all,
but we provide them just in case you do want a framework to follow as
you begin to use journals.
1. Decide on a subject, a composition, a view, a vantage point, a
frame, and a format, even if roughly drawn on your page and
viewed only with your two hands.
2. See and draw in your sketchbook journal as carefully as you
have in the preceding exercises.
3. Consider how much time you’ll have to make an entry so you
don’t rush.
4. Try to draw every day—practice is the key.
The Art of Drawing
A journal recording the joys of motherhood—what happened during the nine months of waiting,
certain details about the birth, and early drawings of your newest family member—will be treas-
ured later on, by both you and the child. You could also do the same for a new pet. After all,
like babies, they will provide you with lots of material.
Back to the Drawing Board
In The Artist’s Way (New York:
Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1992), Julia
Cameron suggests writing three
“morning pages” every single
day! While you don’t have to do
something quite this structured,
knowing that you can use a jour-
nal to get rid of the extraneous
details of life can be a very free-
ing experience. Try it, and you’ll
see what we mean. You can also
draw those three pages or try for
a mixture of the two.

Expressive Drawing
Expressive drawing can be a release for some of your inner feelings and thoughts, and you
can experiment with color if you like.
Bear in mind that different cultures view color distinctions differently. For the Japanese, for
example, white is the color of mourning and black is for celebration, rather than the reverse
in our western tradition—unless, of course, you live in New York City, where you “must”
wear black. When it comes to color, let your own feelings guide you.

innocence
mourning
black
depression

green
jealousy
growth

Research has shown that certain colors are associated with certain feelings. Take a look at this chart. Do
you agree? If not, you may want to make a chart of your own (you could use one of your journals), docu-
menting what various colors mean to you.
Drawing as a Form of Healing
Healing takes lots of forms. Often, giving yourself the present of time and solace, and even
silence and solitude, can be a healing gift. Whether you use drawing as a therapeutic ad-
junct or as a therapy of its own, its healing aspects are one side effect that’s worth pursuing.
Like anything that takes you out of yourself, drawing can be a way of channeling negative
energy in a more positive direction. Why throw that pot at your beloved when you can
draw a picture of how you’re feeling instead? Even if you feel your drawing ability is still in
its infant stage, you can draw a nasty picture of someone you’re angry with—and laugh
yourself right out of your snit.

Make lots of notes on your drawings as to color, shape, weather, temperature, shadows, and
anything else you want, to remind you for later. You can use the detail notes for drawing, or just
to remind you of where you were that day. Record and enjoy the details that are different or
unusual. It will get you past your usual observations and opinions of things. Write to enjoy and
remember—but don’t let your mind drift away from the job of seeing visually.

Therapeutic Drawing
Cut down on those shrink sessions and bills and put the self-help books in a closet. The
time you spend drawing and expressing yourself on paper can be surprisingly therapeutic.
You could feel elation and peace from setting aside time just for you. You could begin to
value yourself more. You could feel very real accomplishment at learning how to draw
when you thought you couldn’t. You may use that feeling to tackle other things you
thought you couldn’t do, like stopping smoking, losing weight, organizing your time more
efficiently, learning a new computer program, or even changing your job to something
more satisfying and creative—like drawing!
A drawing a day keeps the doctor away.
—Dan Welden
Spontaneous Drawing
You can try some of those beginning exercises again, particularly the drawing without 
looking and drawing negative space, two of the more right-brained exercises, to see what 
responses you have now. They might unleash a different creativity or an interest in 
abstraction, or a new experience in using texture. What’s important here is spontaneity;
don’t think, Old Lefty, just do it!
Zen and Drawing
Zen in drawing is actually what this is all about, getting to a meditative,
intuitive place (the right side) and letting go all the disturbance (Old
Lefty) in order to just be, see, and draw.
When it comes to drawing, having a Zen approach means allowing
things to develop as they will, without the need for control that marks
so much of our lives.
A Zen way of life incorporates everything from meditation to ordered
simplicity in order to better appreciate the interconnectedness of all
things. It follows, then, that a Zen way of drawing might be one simple
line which points in a surprising new direction.
Whether it’s Zen, spontaneous drawing, therapeutic drawing, or just
plain old revenge drawing, keeping track of your moods in a sketch-
book journal can be a surprisingly simple way of rediscovering yourself.
So, armed with some new materials and techniques, go forth into your
everyday surroundings with a fresh vision of what you see.
Your house and immediate surroundings are filled with things to see
and draw … and then there is the wild blue yonder.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Zen is more than a religious
practice, it’s a philosophy and
way of life that comes from
Japanese Zen Buddhism. At its
most basic, Zen can be thought
of as a holistic approach to being
that takes for granted the inter-
connectedness of all things and
encourages simplicity in living in
order to live with the complex.

The Least You Need to Know
➤A sketchbook or illuminated journal is a place for you, your thoughts, dreams, exper-
iments, tests, notes, remembrances, hopes, musings … and drawing practice.
➤You can have as many sketchbook journals as you have reasons for having them, or
just because you couldn’t resist.
➤Setting aside the time to draw can be a great gift to give to yourself or someone you
love.
➤Peace and serenity are hard to come by in our world. Drawing as a meditation can
be the path to spiritual release and learning.

➤Look how far you’ve come
➤Reviewing what you already know
➤Slowly you draw, step-by-step
➤Taking stock and moving on
The goal of the artist is the achievement of the truly creative spirit. It must be earned through
discipline and work. Among other disciplines, drawing is basic.
—Harry Sternberg
Since you’ve come with us this far, you’ve probably got quite a collection of drawings by
now. Part of what scares people—especially adults—about learning to draw is the fear of not
being good. But you know what? That’s Old Lefty, rearing his ugly head yet again. Your
right brain knows that you can’t get to the good stuff without making a few messes and
more than a few mistakes. But don’t take our word for it. Let’s go back through your draw-
ings, so you can see for yourself just how far you’ve come.
Through the Looking Glass
Going back through your drawings can be a revealing experience, even if you only started
them a few weeks ago. Your first surprise will be just how much progress you’ve made in
your technical skill. That’s because just drawing something every day means you’re practic-
ing, and practice will improve any skill.
Before you start judging your work too harshly (don’t let Old Lefty have any say!), why not
use the checklists in this chapter to see what you’ve learned. You may even want to tab this
chapter for future reference, because we’ve pulled in every lesson you’ve learned up until
now in one convenient location.

Seeing as a Child
In Chapter 2, “Toward Seeing for Drawing,” you took your first tentative baby steps toward
seeing as an artist does—with your right brain. By now, you’ve heard us saying this for so
long, it’s something that’s as basic to you as breathing.
Still, remembering to see everything with the openness and creativity of a child—with your
right brain—is one of the most important things you can do for your drawing.
Look/Don’t Look
In Chapter 3, “Loosen Up,” you tried several drawings without looking at the page after
you’d set your pencil to draw. Drawing without looking at what you’re drawing helps you
banish Old Lefty to his tidy, ordered corner, where he belongs.
You may want to try a new drawing-without-looking exercise now, just for practice.
Guides Are What You Make Them
Whether you use a guide like a plastic picture plane or a viewfinder frame, or draw freehand,
the first step in drawing is seeing. To help you decide which is the best way for you to begin,
we’ve prepared a review of these three approaches to seeing what you draw.
Plastic Picture Plane Practice
In Chapter 4, “The Picture Plane,” we introduced you to the plastic picture plane. We’ve re-
ferred to it since, but it’s possible you haven’t used yours again since Chapter 4. If that’s the
case (or even if it’s not), why not get out your plastic picture plane and
practice with it? (Say that 10 times fast.)
1. Pick a subject for your drawing.
2. Line up your plastic picture plane with your eyes, keeping it per-
fectly still. Rest it on a table, or hold it straight up and down at
a level that you can see through and draw on at the same time.
3. Close one eye and take a good long look through your picture
plane. See what you can see, not what you think.
4. See the image through the lines that you put on the picture
plane, but try to note where things are relative to the lines:
➤What part of the image is in the middle?
➤What part is near the diagonal?
➤What part is halfway across?
➤On which side of each grid is each part?
➤Does a particular line go from top to bottom or across?
➤Does a curve start in one box and travel to another before
it disappears?
➤And then what?
5. Uncap your marker and decide on a place to start.
6. Start to draw your subject, line by line.
7. Keep drawing.

Take some time now to go back

153
Chapter 13 ➤This Is a Review—There Will Be a Test
When you have put in all that you see in your object, take a moment and observe the accu-
racy with which you have drawn a complicated drawing. Try to see where the plastic picture
plane made it easy for you to draw a difficult part, like a table in perspective, or the scale of
two objects, or the detail on the side of a box, or the pattern of a fabric that was in folds.
These potential problems are no longer problems, once you really see and draw what you
see.
A View Through Your Viewfinder Frame
In Chapter 5, “Finding the View,” you were first introduced to the viewfinder frame. Just for
practice, why not get out your viewfinder frame again?
1. Decide on something to draw. You can keep it simple.
2. Position yourself, your drawing materials in front of you, and the object out in front of
you at an angle (45 degrees) where you can see your whole subject.
3. Pick a viewfinder frame that surrounds the subject quite
closely on all sides.
4. Draw a proportionally equal rectangle on your paper.
5. Reposition the viewfinder frame until your subject is nicely
framed within the window and spend some time really see-
ing your subject through it.
6. Close one eye and do the following:
➤Observe the diagonals and center marks on the
viewfinder frame.
➤See where your subject fits against the sides of the
frame.
Isolating an object with
a plastic picture plane. 
Back to the Drawing Board
Use your viewfinder frame to
know where a particular piece of
your subject belongs. Be sure to
draw only what you can see in
the frame, and nothing else.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
154
➤See where your subject touches the floor or table.
➤See where its top is.
➤Look at the angles.
7. Begin to draw your subject on your paper in the same place as you see it in the frame.
8. Using an imaginary vertical line, check all the angles you’ve drawn to see how they
stack up.
9. Add details, as you can really see them and relate them to what you have drawn. Take
your time.
Using the viewfinder
frame.
Or, Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide
As you work the drawings throughout the rest of this book, you can use any, all, or none of
the guides, from your plastic picture plane to your viewfinder frame. It all depends on how
confident you feel. If you are not actually using the guides, it’s because you are using them
automatically, in your mind’s eye (or is it your eye’s mind—it’s so hard to keep them
straight …).
If you lose your place, use a guide; that’s what they are there for. We will remind you of
them from time to time, but from now on, you’ll choose how to use them and whether
you can, even part of the time, just see and draw.
Accentuate the Negative
In Chapter 6, “Negative Space as a Positive Tool,” you learned how to draw negative space.
Here’s an exercise to help you review what you learned there.
1. Divide your paper into four equal quadrants.
2. Hold the viewfinder frame very still and frame your subject in a window.

155
Chapter 13 ➤This Is a Review—There Will Be a Test
3. Pick a “spot of space” somewhere inside your subject to start, and really see it. Close
one eye and “see” that spot until it becomes more real than the subject itself. You will
know when this has happened because it will pop forward as a spot of space while the
subject itself will fade or recede.
4. See where that spot is relative to the grid lines on your viewfinder frame. You can also
look at the spot through your plastic picture plane to isolate just where it is relative to
the grid.
5. Use the grid on your paper to draw the first spot of space on the paper.
6. Think relatively and relationally. Try to see where your spot is relative to the marks on
the frame, the grid on the plastic, and the light lines on the paper.
The Art of Drawing
The most important thing about drawing negative space is to stay focused on the space. Forget
about the actual subject; pretend it’s not even there. Remember to keep one eye closed each
time you find your next spot of space. Find the shape of that spot by seeing it relative to your
grid marks. Think about comparing the shapes of the negative space and the edges of those
shapes. Are the lines horizontal or vertical? If they are neither, try to see the angle relative to
horizontal or vertical and draw what you see. The trick to drawing negative space is drawing the
holes, not the thing.
As you draw more and more of the negative space shapes, it will be easier and easier to fit
in the remaining ones. The spaces around your subject will actually define your subject.
When you have drawn all the negative spaces on your drawing, check each one in turn
against the subject itself. Make small corrections to the shapes of the negative spaces as you
see them. You can lightly shade the negative space shapes as you refine them, if you’d like.
Your subject will take turns with the space around it—one will appear positive and the
other negative, then they will flip.
When you are finished, your drawing will be a very different record of seeing. Your subject
will come out of the space you have drawn around it!
Making Arrangements
In Chapter 9 you made your first arrangement of objects to create a still life. You learned
about vantage point and viewpoint, and how looking at objects from different angles could
change their appearance. Now it’s time to practice drawing an arrangement again. 

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
156
Slowly You Draw, Step-by-Step
Just for practice (and isn’t that what this is all about?), make another arrangement of ob-
jects or furniture to draw now. You’ll follow the same steps as always, using the guides as
much or as little as you need them.
1. Arrange yourself comfortably.
2. Select your objects or your view.
3. Arrange your objects, still life composition, or move the furni-
ture to suit you.
4. Decide on your viewpoint and eye level.
5. Adjust the lighting if necessary.
6. Establish a format and size of drawing.
7. Take a moment to decide on your probable medium and paper.
If you are not sure, go for a high-quality piece of paper; you
never know …. 
8. Use the viewfinder frame to see your choice.
9. Make a box on your paper that is proportionally equal to your
viewfinder frame at any size. Remember the diagonals to keep
the box and the frame in proportion.

how they vanish, or become

get flatter as they are turned
away from your view.

157
Chapter 13 ➤This Is a Review—There Will Be a Test
10. Use your plastic picture plane or your viewfinder frame to see the arrangement or view
in space.
11. Site what you see on your page.
12. Start with light planning lines for the simple shapes, lines, angles, and the general
outline.
The Art of Drawing
Try to see objects as if they were transparent. See their space; imagine a dotted line at the back
of where they are to ensure there is enough space for the objects to really be there in space. If
an object is too close, it cannot really be there in the same spot with another object. You can
look straight down on your arrangement, even diagram it to help you see the space that you
have to create for each object.
Making a List and Checking It Twice
As you draw, you’ll want to consider the following:
1. Check your initial light drawing for accuracy.
2. Check the shapes, the spaces, and look at the negative
spaces, how things overlap, and which way the angles are.
See the basic geometric shapes in space.
3. Use your viewfinder frame to gauge any angle relative to hor-
izontal or vertical, and the grid marks on the edge of the
frame.
4. Use your pencil to do the same. Hold it at horizontal or 
vertical next to an angle and see the difference.
5. You can use a carpenter’s angle measure to see an angle and transfer it to your 
drawing.
6. Draw a box for something that is hard to draw. Put the box in space, then draw the
thing in the box.
7. See relationally. As you are sure of one shape, relate the others to it. Keep checking
and adjusting until you are happy with your drawing.
Form and Function
Now, begin to work on form.
➤You can add tone, or try to define the form with line, or you can leave it a contour
line drawing.
Try Your Hand
If you have a problem, use the
plastic picture plane and transfer
what you see to your drawing.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
158
➤If you choose to add form, adjust your lighting if necessary.
➤Make a tonal chart for the values in your arrangement.
➤Squint to see the extremes of value in you arrangement and subdue the detail and
mid-tones.
➤Pick out the lightest spots and the darkest.
➤Add some tone to the middle shades, from the lighter ones to the darker ones.
➤Try to see tones as having shapes on your subjects.
➤Look at shadows next to things and under things as well as shadows on other things.
You can work toward a very tonal drawing or you can merely suggest volume, perhaps just
with shadows. Add detail and texture as you see them. Use those naturalist’s eyes of yours
for a clear seeing of detail.
The Art of Drawing
Rendering texture requires a mark that is appropriate for describing the texture. Experiment on a
separate piece of paper.
Detail and texture may also require a lot of planning and measuring, especially if there is a pat-
tern on china, a fabric print, or fine detail on seashells.
Getting Some Distance on Your Work
Get up and look at your work from a distance, with fresh eyes. Don’t hesitate to go back
and fix something. Work patiently—it is your drawing.
As you work, be alert (the world needs more alerts). See the lines, tones, textures, and detail
begin to work together.
Determine if your work is getting to be all one tone with little contrast. You can change
your tonal range in a number of ways, including:
➤Lightening the lights
➤Darkening the darks
➤Darkening the main lines in the contour line
➤Erasing out part of the texture or tone to just suggest it
Your Learning-to-Draw Cheat Sheet
We thought it might be helpful to have a cheat sheet, with all the “rules” in one place, 
so we created this Learning to Draw Cheat Sheet, which also appears on the tear-out card

book or tack it up on the wall near your drawing table, referring to it as you work.
Meanwhile, you’ll always be able to find it right here, in case that tear card gets too dog-
eared from constant use! 
1. Take yourself and your work seriously. Make yourself a place to work that is just for
you.
2. Set a time to work. Make a date with yourself.
3. Look around for some first subjects as ideas.
4. Arrange yourself comfortably so you can see your subject and your paper easily.
5. Select your objects or your view.
6. Arrange your objects, still life composition, or move the furniture to suit.
7. Look at things flat or at angles to see how they vanish—that is, become smaller—as
they recede. Ellipses get smaller or flatter as the object is turned away. Look at the
main angles in your view.
8. Decide on your viewpoint and eye level.
9. Adjust the lighting if necessary.
10. Establish a format and size of drawing.
11. Decide on your medium and paper.
12. Use the viewfinder frame to see your choice.
13. Make a box on your paper that is proportionally equal to your
viewfinder frame at your chosen size.
14. Remember the diagonals keep the box and frame in propor-
tion.
15. Use your plastic picture plane or your viewfinder frame to see
the arrangement or view in space.
16. Site what you see on your page.
17. Start with light planning lines for the simple shapes, lines, an-
gles, and the general outline.

All Around the
House: A Few
New Drawing
Ideas to Try
In This Chapter
➤Finding subjects to draw
➤Avoiding distraction and making time for your work
➤Touring your house from top to bottom
➤Making personal choices—your drawings will be as individual as you are
I have probably drawn as many chairs and desks and corners and interior objects as I have
landscapes.
—Hannah Hinchman, Bloomsbury Review Interview, Jan/Feb 2000.
The skills for drawing all that follows are yours—or, at least, within your grasp—if you pro-
ceed step-by-step. Each of the next seven chapters has a theme area for you to explore: from
inside your house to your garden, or out and about in the countryside, on a village street, at
a boatyard, on a farm, at the zoo—anywhere you choose to go with your sketchbook or a
full drawing set-up.
Your House Is Full of Ideas for Drawing Practice
In this chapter, you’ll begin by taking a walk through your own house and seeing what
you’ve already got, just waiting to be drawn. Chances are, you’ve got a wealth of material.
You can try any subject as a sketchbook/journal entry, or you can set up to try a larger,
more finished drawing that you will work on a few times. If so, pick a nice piece of paper
and spend the first session planning, arranging, lighting, and siting your arrangement on
the page.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills

Time Is of the Essence 
On the plus side, your house has all your favorite stuff. On the minus side, it has most of
your distractions right there, too. Of course, highly disciplined professionals like Lauren
and Lisa long ago came to terms with these distractions. (And if you believe that one, we
have a bridge that you could buy …)
Seriously, though, being earnest about your time is the first step. Maybe you have had
enough success with this book to be more committed to your own work. If that’s the case,
keep it up!
Once you’ve found some stuff around the house you want to draw, you’ll want to set a time
to work. Do enough of your daily chores to get by, but only just. This is the hard part, leav-
ing those dishes so you can draw. You may hear your mother’s voice in your head, telling
you you’re being self-indulgent or childish. Lesson One: Ignore her.
Get your coffee, your lunch, whatever you need, and give yourself a time slot to work.
Some people find actually writing the time on their calendar is enough to make them arrive
in their studio, ready to work.
Turn on the answering machine, turn off the computer. Turn on some music, turn off the
TV. Put out the dog and let in the cat.
The Art of Drawing
The most important thing is to make this time your own. That means that if the UPS man rings
the bell, you won’t answer; he’ll leave the package on your stoop or with a neighbor. It means
that even if you hear your long-lost lover’s voice on the answering machine, you won’t give in
to the urge to pick up the phone. You won’t go to see what the dog is barking at now, even if
the coyotes are howling, too. Uninterrupted time is what we’re talking about here. Make a date
with yourself—and then keep it.
Your Kitchen Is a Storehouse
A good place to start is right in your kitchen—you’ll be near the cof-
feemaker. However, you’ll want to avoid the refrigerator, for obvious
reasons—you’ll end up snacking instead of sketching. What you will
choose to draw in the kitchen—or anywhere around the house, for that
matter—will fall into three categories:
1. Objects seen up close and personal
2. A composed still life arrangement
3. A corner of a room—as is, or you can rearrange the 
furniture
Back to the Drawing Board
Rearranging is one thing, but
major renovation takes time
away from drawing. Don’t use it
as an excuse for not drawing!

167
Chapter 14 ➤All Around the House: A Few New Drawings to Try
You will learn by trying all of these things. Perhaps, after you have tried to see it and draw
it, you will also begin to see your house differently and end up rearranging it (unless, like
Lisa, you do this all the time already).
But now, since you’re all settled with your coffee and your drawing pad in your kitchen
anyway, let’s poke around and see what we can find to draw.
Silverware
Forks, spoons, and knives can make the most interesting of subjects for a drawing. Reach
over and open your silverware drawer and pull out one of each … or three of one. Arrange
them on a placemat, or set up an entire place setting, complete with a vase and fresh-picked
flower, and draw that.
Silverware and place settings are just the beginning. Open your cupboards, too.
Anything from around
your house is fair game
as a drawing subject.
Set your table and draw
it, too!

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
168
Pitchers and Bowls
When you wander through your local art museum or galleries, you’ll probably notice that
pitchers and bowls abound in still lifes. These objects are artists’ favorites for good reason;
they have lovely curved lines that are fun to draw, and their varying shapes and sizes can
add interest, too.
If you decide to draw a pitcher or a bowl (or both), you may want to use some other objects
in the kitchen for your arrangement as well. A tea towel arranged at the base of a pitcher
can add both dimension and shading. Some apples or oranges placed in a bowl can add
color (even when you’re drawing in black and white) and tone.
Make a simple still life by setting some fruit in a bowl and then drawing it. Or just draw your plate
rack—dishes included, of course. Then, bring it all together.
The truth is, just about anything in your kitchen is a potential drawing subject. So whether
it’s a loaf of bread, a jug of lemonade, or thou, get thee to a drawing pad.
Not Just for Sleeping Anymore 
If you’ve finished your coffee (and your still life), you’ve probably got
lots of energy now. That’s good, because it’s time to get up and wander
into some other rooms. Let’s start with the bedroom, where there’s a
wealth of things just waiting to be drawn.
First, take a look at the entire room. How is the furniture arranged? Is it
pleasing? Pick a vantage point you like and quickly sketch what you
see. You may want to toss a scarf over a bedpost to add some texture,
or move a plant to create a more eye-pleasing arrangement. You may
decide to leave the scarf and the plant where you’ve moved them after
you’ve finished drawing, too; that’s part of the fun.
Next, pick some singular arrangement in your room that you’d like to
draw. Lisa has an old spider plant set in an equally old basket on an an-
tique chair she got at a Nebraska auction for 25 cents (everything in
Lisa’s house comes with a story attached). You might have some of
your favorite photos or keepsakes arranged on your dresser, or a lamp
and some books on your nightstand. The possibilities are endless.

Fabrics
Fabrics can make a surprisingly pleasing composition. Even if you don’t sew, your clothes,
comforter, pillows, and curtains are each of a different fabric, and setting one against an-
other can create an arrangement you’ll want to draw.
It may help to pretend you’re Martha Stewart. Artfully arrange a few pillows against your
headboard. Add a breakfast tray (oh yeah, we all have those handy). How about a pretty
nightie, or a fabric throw? (Or some craftsmen’s tools, a saw or two, and that Harley …)
Arrange your fabrics as if they’re casually thrown, without them looking like a mess.
Fabrics present their own unique problems. They are the essence of surface texture, with all
sorts of spots, lines, patterns, plaids, flowers—you name it—sitting on top of some flexible
material that has fallen into interesting but hard-to-draw folds, creases, and overlaps.
The solution is to draw the shapes first, as always, but this is ever so much more important
with fabric. Then look at tone, the lights and shadows of the folds of fabric. Try to lightly
shade to define what the fabric is doing.
When you can see in your drawing what the fabric is actually doing, then and only then
should you start adding the surface texture. See it disappear as the fabric folds under itself.
Or is it covered by another object? Does it come out on the other side? Don’t rush along
here; pattern and texture take time and patience.

Shoes
Even if you’re not Imelda Marcos, you’ve probably got more than one pair of shoes. Lisa is
not a shoe maven, but her closet reveals riding boots, hiking boots, two pairs of heels (both
from the ‘70s), sandals, and loafers. If you’ve got a pair of riding boots, try leaning them
against the leg of a chair, and then drawing them. Or put the sandals on a throw rug and
throw in the towel, too. What you draw is limited only by your imagination.
Even your shoes can
make a pleasing
arrangement.
Hats and Gloves
Picture a pair of elbow-length gloves draped across the brim of a wide-brimmed hat, and
you’ve got the makings of a lovely drawing. But even if your gloves and hat are less elegant,
they’re still a good start for an interesting arrangement.
Let’s say the only hat you can find is a ski cap. Do you have ski gloves, too? No gloves at
all? Why not brew up a steaming cup of cocoa? Draw it and it will warm you up on the
coldest of winter days. Get the idea?
Set your hat and a bas-
ket on a table and draw

Drawing in the Living Room
Let’s try another room. How about your living room? Is this a for-
mal place, reserved only for company? Or do you have a “great
room” where your entire family gathers at the end of the day? If
it’s the latter, chances are you’ll find everything from open books
to unopened mail, from television remote controls to Gameboys.
Anything in your living or great room is fair game, including your
spouse snoring in his or her favorite chair. But even if that chair is
unoccupied, it may be just the thing.
Try Another Chair
The first chair you drew was a fairly simple one, so this time, try
drawing a chair that’s a bit more elaborate. You’re in the living
room, so you’ve probably got a number of choices—from a well-
worn recliner to an antique rocker or even, perhaps, a Victorian
settee or fainting couch. Take a look at the different textures of
wood or fabric. What pleases you most?
Back to the Drawing Board
When it comes to drawing a
chair, you may decide to return
to your plastic picture plane to
get the angles just right. If so,
that’s fine. Remember, artists use
aids like plastic picture planes
and view finder frames all the
time, so there’s no reason you
should feel like you’re cheating if
you do, too.
Chairs make simple and convenient drawing subjects.
Antique Lamps—and Antique Things
Lisa’s husband teases that she will never have enough antique lamps, and, while Lisa dis-
agrees and insists that she bought the last one this past weekend, finding antique lamps to
draw will not be a problem if you’re at Lisa’s house.
Antiques—whether lamps, tables, or even Underwood typewriters—are terrific drawing sub-
jects for a number of reasons. They’re unusual (you won’t find them at every Wal-Mart),
they’re attractive, and they usually have enough visual interest to carry off a drawing all by
themselves, without adding a thing. Lamps, candles, and the warm glow they give off, pro-
vide interesting challenges to the careful observer.

Objects That Reflect You
We all collect something, it seems, something that we just can’t resist in a shop, or some-
thing that we find on a trip, or something we found in nature, and then all of a sudden
there are more of the same, and a collection is in the making. These are the things that per-
sonal drawings are made of.
Lauren has been a collector since childhood, when she filled her dresser drawers with shells,
rocks, pinecones, and a collection of hundreds of wildflowers pressed in waxed paper.
(Clothing was less important then.) Now she has a large studio to house all her collections,
which are her favorite things to draw.
Use the things that you love in your drawings to give them a truly personal quality.
Bathroom Basics 
After all that coffee you had in the kitchen, you’ve probably visited the bathroom once or
twice already since you began this chapter; let’s head there now once again and see what
you can find to draw here. Even this most utilitarian of rooms will surprise you with its 
potential drawing subjects.

What’s on your bathroom counter? Half-empty bottles of lotion, empty cans of mousse,
open mascara tubes, and broken lipsticks … or a pretty arrangement of seashells in a 
basket? A razor, nail clipper, dirty towel, and soap scum? Whichever way, there’s something
there for you to draw. Sure, the seashells in the basket will make for a more visually pleas-
ing drawing, but the detritus will make for an unusual one that may be visually striking in
its own right. Pretty is as pretty does, after all, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Don’t toss those empty
bottles—draw them in-
stead! Or draw those
seashells in their basket.
Any arrangement in your
bathroom can be the
makings for a drawing.
A Sunny Window 
Find a room that has a sunny window. Does the sun pour through in the early morning or
just before sunset? Maybe it gets filtered northern light, a favorite of artists, or dappled
light filtered through the leaves of a tall old tree.
What’s on your windowsill? An arrangement of colored bottles can be the basis of a simple
but lovely line drawing—without one color pencil being used. If your window is framed by
sweeping sheer curtains that flutter in the breeze, another nice drawing subject is at your
fingertips.

By now, it should be clear that the possibilities for drawing subjects in your home are limit-
ed only by your imagination. So grab your pencil and paper, and get to work!
Out of the House and onto the Patio (Door) 
While your materials and subjects can vary endlessly, the process is essentially the same
every single time you begin a new drawing. The minor variations are your needs at the time
and your choices as to how to proceed, what medium to use, or how
finished a piece you are trying for.
Remember, for fun or for help, use your patio or sliding glass door as a
big plastic picture plane. Put a few objects on a table right outside the
door and try to draw them on the glass. Use a dry-erase pen that makes
a readable line. You can draw your patio or deck chairs on the glass, or
maybe some potted plants or a trellis planted with a vine. You will find
that objects need to be very close to the door, or they will be very
small when you draw them on the glass. If the light outside is strong
enough, you can make a tracing of your drawing on lightweight paper,
using the door as a big light box. In an urban landscape, use your
apartment window or glass terrace door; draw the buildings you see,
complete with their windows, terraces, and fire escapes.
Where the finish point is will always be your choice. You are done
when you are done.

In This Chapter
➤The pleasures of drawing in a garden
➤Botanical drawing as science and art
➤Explore the natural world outside your garden
When I spoke of flowers, I was a flower, with all the prerogatives of flowers, especially the
right to come alive in the Spring.
—William Carlos Williams
Enough time spent wandering around your house—it’s time to get outdoors and see what
else there is to draw. Not surprisingly, there’s a wealth of material just outside your door. Go
ahead, open it up, and step into the wonderland of drawing subjects that is your garden.
In the beginning, there was Eden, that most famous of gardens. Sure, Adam and Eve were
banished, but we’ve been working our way back ever since. With a sketchbook in hand, you
can succeed where Adam and Eve failed (and even get that troublesome snake nailed down
in an illustration) by drawing a garden that will last and last.
Botanical Drawing Is an Art
A flower offers a removed beauty, more abstract than it can be in the human being, even more
exquisite.
—Maria Oakey Dewing, “Flowers Painters,” Art & Progress 6, No.8 (June 1915).
The first step in drawing anything in nature is learning to see it and draw its parts, such as
the separate parts of flowers, with the same attention you’ve learned to give to all details.
From petals and stamens to leaves and stems, every part of a flower has a wealth of detail,
there for the seeing.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
180
When you first start out drawing specimens from nature, it’s best to work at a scale that’s 75
percent to 100 percent of the original, so you can see and draw the detail.
Playing with scale comes with practice, and once you’re comfortable
with working close to reality, for fun you can try 200 percent or 400
percent—and really see the detail.
Take Your Sketchbook with You
What if you haven’t got a garden of your own? What a great reason to
head for the hills or the botanical garden, or even the “ritzy” section of
town. Pack up your drawing supplies in the trunk. For drawing al fresco,
you may want to add the following to your drawing kit as well:
➤A stool, for sitting
➤An easel or drawing board, for setting your pad on
➤Clips, to hold your sketchbook in place
➤An umbrella or hat, for shade
Whether you’re drawing in your garden or someone else’s, be aware of
place. A sense of place is a strong element in garden drawing, whatever
the view. Consider the following before you set up your stool and easel:
1. Make sure it is clear where you are. Light and shade are as im-
portant to a drawing as the objects themselves.
2. How does it feel?
➤What is the light like?
➤What time of day is it?
➤Do you feel the warmth of the sun or a cool breeze, wel-
come shade on a hot day, or the briskness of fall?

It Started with Eden
Whether the flower or the color is the focus I do not know. I do know that the flower is paint-
ed large enough to convey to you my experience of the flower and what is my experience of the
flower if it is not color.
—Georgia O’Keeffe
When it comes to flowers, a rose is not just a rose, as Gertrude Stein said, it is the rose, the
one you are looking at right this minute. Sure, it has similarities to other roses, but it also
has a detail that is all its own.
Learn to look for this singularity in all of nature. Think about individual plants as individu-
als. Lauren likes to think of them as if they are friends, especially in the spring (the season
as we write this), when she has been missing them. Then, it’s like greeting old friends and
meeting new ones.
There’s nothing like the feeling when those first crocuses and daffodils come up in the gar-
den. It’s a reminder of the cycle of life, of renewal and rebirth. No matter how utterly blue
you’ve felt all winter, seeing those first brave shoots of green push through the snow re-
minds us that summer is just around the bend.
Whether it’s springtime, summer, or autumn, you can use whatever’s blooming in your gar-
den to practice drawing flowers and leaves. This practice will help you achieve precision in
your drawing technique, as well as honing your powers of minute observation.
Try to capture the feel of the weather and the season, as well as the day itself, in your drawing.

Be a Botanist
Being a botanist doesn’t have to mean going back to college. You can learn a lot about
plants simply by observing them, and, when it comes to drawing, observation time is time
well spent.
1. Begin by examining the basic shapes that are familiar, 
including
➤Cones.
➤Disks.
➤Spheres.
➤Trumpets.
➤Fluted shapes.
➤Balls.
2. How do the pistils and stamen attach to the stem? (You may
want to refer back to the drawing at the beginning of this chap-
ter to see just what and where pistils and stamen are.)
3. Count the petals. Do they appear in pairs or groups? Are they
symmetrical? How do the flowers fit on the stem?
4. Look at leaves on the stem. Are they alternately or oppositely
arranged? Look at the stem connection.
5. Get botany or gardening books to read about detail and struc-
ture if they are new to you. Just flipping through the pages will
begin to give you a better idea of what flowers are all about.
Every flower and leaf of
every plant has a shape
and detail all its own.
Try Your Hand
When drawing a new species, re-
member to look for the angles
and proportions. Each butterfly
or lizard has its own shapes, pro-
portions, coloring, and texture to
explore as you draw. Shells, par-
ticularly, have a strong line or
axis from tip to end that needs
to be seen and drawn. The myri-
ad of detail in nature is its
strength and its wonder.

Chapter 15 ➤Into the Garden, with Pencils, not Shovels
Work on a Blooming Stem
Okay, enough studying! It’s time to try drawing a blooming stem. For your first subject,
you’ll want to look at buds, seeds, and stems, and decide what you’d like to draw. Once
you’ve picked out a subject, use the drawing checklist that appears on the tear-out reference
card in the front of the book, and get to work.
As the season progresses, look at seeds, pods, berries, nuts, cones … anything you can find
in your garden or any other garden, and draw those, too. The more you draw, remember,
the more practice you get. Eventually, the shapes and forms will be remembered by your
hand, familiar and easy to execute.
A variety of blooming
stems.
Butterflies, Insects, and Seashells, Too
The eye that sees is the I experiencing itself in what it sees. It becomes self-aware and realizes
that it is an integral part of the great continuum of all that is. It sees things such as they are.
—Frederick Frank
Your flower drawings can include all the winged visitors to your garden and a mix of
seashells around the pots or along the paths. Chinese and Japanese nature art has always
included butterflies, insects, and seashells to compliment the flowers and foliage, and you
can do this, too. Add what you see in your garden, from butterflies and hummingbirds in
northern gardens to snakes and lizards on tropical patios.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
184
Go Wild!
When you draw a leaf that has become a fragile net of veins, you are really marveling at the
wonder of nature and finding a way of capturing that fragility.
—Jill Bays
Garden drawings don’t have to be just flowers and plants. Don’t forget the insects, shells, and
butterflies. When drawing a bird or butterfly, you might want to have a good reference book 
on hand to study. For precision, try copying high quality, detailed images before you venture
outdoors. This effort will enhance your nature studies when you try to capture the moment in
the wild! 
The Art of Drawing
Lauren learned flower fairy tales and woods lore from her grandfather, who was an avid natural-
ist and artist. The fleeting delicacy of wildflowers and the pristine climate they thrive in is there
to be enjoyed, but should be carefully respected and protected. Don’t pick wildflowers; go out
and visit them and draw them where they live. You will both be better off for the effort.
Wildflowers are Lauren’s favorites; they have always been. They were like friends when she
was a kid, and are still. For Lauren, the best part of spring is seeing them return, waiting 
for a special one, and hunting in woods or fields to find a wildflower that she hasn’t seen

185
Chapter 15 ➤Into the Garden, with Pencils, not Shovels
lately. Wildflower meadows are great places to find beautiful and plentiful drawing subjects.
The natural arrangements are fun and freeform, without the pressure of a highly arranged
still life. Or, take the challenge to see a great composition lurking in that aimless meadow.
The natural beauty of
wildflowers is a natural
for your sketchbook, too.
The Almighty Vegetable
You can tell how much the Italians love their gardens by looking at Italian artwork. The at-
tention to detail and the variation is endless. One of Italian artists’ favorite subjects (other
than overweight women and prophets, that is) is the almighty vegetable. But don’t run
back inside and open the crisper of your refrigerator. Let’s try drawing some vegetables be-
fore they’ve been separated from their leaves and vines.
Drawing in your (or someone else’s) vegetable garden is a season-long endeavor. You can
begin at planting time, when the first compost is mixed with the newly defrosted earth and
you lay in the rows where you’ll plant your seeds. Try to capture how that fresh-turned
earth smells (especially if your compost includes manure … ).
Next, it’s planting time. Draw a quick sketch after the seeds are raked in. Get the idea?
You’re making a record of a season in your vegetable garden, one step at a time.
Soon, the first fragile green seedlings will pop up. Get out there with your sketchbook and
draw them, too. Sure, the drawing will still be mostly dirt, but soon enough your garden
will be bursting with growth, and you’ll have your drawing to see how far it—and you—
have come.
Before you know it, the first pickings will be ready. Draw them drooping from their vines,
and then draw them in their baskets, freshly picked.
How did mere dirt end up as so much bounty? Too many vegetables, so little time. Still,
take a minute to sketch the bumper crop, before the big giveaway. Be sure to include that
sign at the end of your driveway: “Free Zucchini.”

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
186
After the harvest, the empty vines and stalks may already be beginning to brown. Draw
them before you rake them out and compost them. There! You’ve recorded a season in your
vegetable garden. And next year, you can do it all over again. Drawing vegetables, vines,
and stalks is a great practice in discovering a variety of shapes and forms and how they
emerge and evolve across the season—and the pages of your sketchbook!
Record an entire season in your garden, and you can flip through it during the winter to
remind you of all the work you don’t have to do when it’s cold outside!
Garden Pots and Tools
The Italians are also masters at container gardens. Their balconies and doorways are always
decorated with collections of pots and planters, filled with variety in color and texture.
The Art of Drawing
Pots and saucers in drawings must be seen and drawn carefully to keep them from tilting and
tipping or looking flat. Remember to establish eye level and look hard at the ellipses on the
pots and saucers. The closer they are to eye level, the flatter they are; the further down below
eye level they are, the wider they will be. The pots need to be symmetrical. And don’t forget to
check that they are really vertical: A light line up the center helps to check. Make sure you
have drawn them accurately before you start rendering them.

187
Chapter 15 ➤Into the Garden, with Pencils, not Shovels
Planters, window boxes, and container gardens are all small exercises in perspective, which
we’ll be discussing in Chapter 16, “What’s Your Perspective?” Draw them using informal per-
spective. Establish eye level. See them as geometric shapes in space: cylinders, spheres, cubes,
and rectangular boxes. Make them sit or hang correctly, and then fill them with detail.
Garden tools against a stone wall or the side of a garden shed make a charming arrangement
with as much challenge as you are up for that day.
Gardens Other Than Your Own
When Lauren was in college, she cut most of her figure-drawing classes for trips up to the
greenhouses and barns that were at the edge of campus in the agriculture school. She drew
every afternoon in the warm moist air of the greenhouses, breathing deeply enough to 
Everything in your garden is fair game for a
drawing.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
188
remember the scent until the next time she could get there. When it
was warmer, she went to the barns and drew baby pigs and sheep, and
sometimes the colts in the fields. Her sketchbooks, when she turned
them in, were a surprise to her instructors, but they had realized she
was not attending the life class—she was out drawing life.
As we’ve said, “gardens” can include garden centers, greenhouses,
botanical gardens—not just a garden of your own. Chances are, your
local nursery won’t mind a bit if you set up your stool and easel in the
middle of their greenhouse. They may even ask to purchase one or two
of your drawings—your first sale!
One word of warning: Outdoor drawing attracts attention, which isn’t
always good for altered states of consciousness. If you prefer to work
unobserved, you’ll need to find a nice, quiet place to work, without
outside interruptions. And that includes making sure there’s not a bull
on the same side of the fence as you are!
What Else Is in Your Garden?
Our gardens are reflections of ourselves, our experiments, and our fantasies. They are places
of the soul, and so are perfect for drawing. Your garden can be simple and austere, practical
or fanciful, fussy or tailored … and so can your drawings. Try to reflect your garden’s per-
sonality in your drawings, then try another, very different garden, with a different ap-
proach. Make your garden drawings as personal as the gardens themselves.
From Figures to Frogs—And a Few Deer and Gnomes
Statues, from figures to frogs, with a few deer, wheelbarrows, and gnomes thrown in for
fun, can be present in your garden and your drawings. The somewhat diminutive scale of
garden ornaments can be fun to play with in a drawing. Flowers are fun with scaled-down
garden statues because they become relatively larger than usual.
➤Ornamentals and statues go from classical to comic, from flashy to peaceful and con-
templative, from natural materials to designer high-tech looks. Whatever you choose,
remember: It’s your garden and your drawing.
➤Arches and gates are other wonderful opportunities to practice perspective, which
we’ll be discussing in Chapter 16. Draw the basic shape in informal perspective, but
use diagonals to help you locate the center of any opening or arch correctly.
➤Garden paths, long and winding or short and straight, add di-
rection and structure to a drawing. Make sure you have drawn
them with eye level in mind so they lay flat in the gardenscape.
➤Walls are great backdrops for the detail in a garden, but they
are also interesting subjects in themselves. Get the angles right
and watch that the rock shapes don’t become monotonous. See
the small shapes and angles that make each rock different.
➤If you are lucky enough to have rocks, a rockscape, a rock-lined
reflecting pool, or a waterfall, you have a world of places to ex-
plore in your drawings.

Birds, Birdhouses, Feeders, and Squirrels
Our gardens also are home to a year-long variety of birds as well as the sometimes unwant-
ed squirrels. Lauren’s yard has a collection of feeders that are very busy all day long. She
can watch the early feeders from her hot tub as she drinks the first of her many cups of cof-
fee, and she has a daily competition with three squirrels to see who’s out of bed first. Some
mornings, she can catch them as they come out of their nest in a far tree.
Whether it’s a plethora of flamingos, drying flow-
ers, or birdhouses, the ornamental objects in a
garden can make for wonderful drawing subjects.

Part 4 ➤Developing Drawing Skills
190
All of what happens in your yard is material for drawing, too. The feeders and birdhouses
are great for practicing perspective, too. You can hang them at various heights and draw
them using informal relational perspective, or you can draw them with formal two-point
perspective as an exercise. Eventually, you will find they are easy to see and draw at any
angle or height.
The birds and squirrels move around quickly, but if you have a good viewing window, you
can begin to make some sketches that capture their gestures, shapes, and proportions.
The fauna in your garden are as much a part of nature as the flora. Draw them, too. Birdhouses and
feeders provide opportunities to develop your perspective skills and learn about geometric shapes, while
also beginning to observe and try your hand at drawing living creatures.

Chairs in the Grass
Chairs in the yard are just like chairs in the house, except you can get a little tan while you
are drawing. Adirondack chairs are a challenge, picnic tables need to be drawn so they stay
flat on the ground, round tables with umbrellas are well worth the time to see and draw, and
even a line of clothes drying in the breeze can make a nice drawing. Be aware of shadows
and the shapes they make. They can add a lot to a simple drawing of a chair in your yard.
The possibilities in your garden—and beyond—are limited only by your imagination. So get
out there and see what you can see and draw.

just came back from the blacksmith, who made iron points for the sticks and iron corners for
the frame. It consists of two long stakes; the frame can be attached to them either way with
strong wooden sticks.
So on the shore or in the meadows or in the fields one can look through it like a window. The
vertical lines and the horizontal line of the frame and the diagonal lines and the intersection
or else the division in squares, certainly give a few pointers which help one make a solid draw-
ing and which indicate the main lines and proportion … of why and how the perspective
causes an apparent change of direction in the lines and change of size in the planes and in the
whole mass. Long and continuous practice with it enables one to draw quick as lightning.
From The Complete Letters of Vincent van Gogh
Perspective is a set of rules to explain how to draw objects in space and make adjustments
for the difference between what the eye sees and the mind knows, or thinks it knows. For
example, the mind knows that a cube has six equal sides, but when a cube is seen in space,
the sides seen at an angle seem to diminish as they recede.
Perspective has always been a challenge to artists, and many, like van Gogh, made elaborate
contraptions to help them see and draw things in space. Perspective can seem a challenge
for you, too, but you can use it as a tool to help you improve your drawing.

In this chapter, we’ll bring perspective into clear focus and simplify it so even an “idiot” can
understand. In fact, there’s nothing terribly complicated about perspective; it’s just a matter
of recording on the page what the eye is really seeing.
Understanding Perspective 
We are used to seeing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional piece of paper be-
cause of the development of photography, but photography was only an idea during the
Renaissance and almost until van Gogh’s time.
The development of photography, as a means of completely accurately representing three-
dimensional space, changed a lot of things for artists. For example, they couldn’t compete
with a camera when it came to reproducing reality, so they began to
experiment with their own ways of “seeing” things, which led into all
the modern schools of painting that we now know, such as cubism, im-
pressionism, and abstract expressionism.
But while modern schools of painting may have altered reality, the fact
of perspective remains a given in the way we perceive the world around
us. Perspective is a kind of trompe l’oeil, in which we know an object’s
actual size, even though it seems very small. The moon, for example,
looks as if it would fit between your fingertips, but you “know” that it
is actually much bigger.
How to render perspective on the page has long been a problem and a
fascination for artists. When it’s handled well, the eye of the beholder
will accept it as naturally as it accepts a “real” scene in space. A chair
that’s smaller than another, for example, will “feel” farther away.
Perspective Simplified
Perspective can be divided into a number of subcategories, which we’ll
keep as simple as we can:
➤Informal perspective is a way to see the relationships between
objects in space. It’s what you see on the picture plane, drawn
on paper by observing and measuring things against things,
shapes against shapes, spaces against spaces, and one against
the other.
➤Aerial perspective is the relative blurring of objects, color, or
detail in space. Scale is seeing that objects get smaller as they re-
cede in the distance. Foreground objects appear to have more
detail and color or color intensity. Images in deep space are less
distinct and less colored.
➤Formal perspective, a more exacting way of looking at and
drawing objects in space, is based on planes or sides of objects,
like walls of a house, “vanishing,” or diminishing, to points at
either side of the horizon line. It is not always necessary if you
see and draw relatively and make a few observations about
things in landscape space.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Perspective is the perception of
objects farther away as smaller
than objects that are closer to us.
Trompe l’oeil is French for
“trick of the eye.” Trompe l’oeil
techniques involve making the
eye “see” something that is paint-
ed seem so three-dimensional
you can’t quite believe it isn’t 
really there.
Back to the Drawing Board
We think it’s important to think
of perspective as a useful tool
rather than a problem. After all,
perspective is everywhere, so you
should use it to your advantage
rather than hide from it.

Chapter 16 ➤What’s Your Perspective?
Perspective and the Picture Plane
You had practice drawing with a plastic picture plane to see the three-dimensional space in
a still life condensed onto the two-dimensional surface of the plastic. Your patio or sliding
glass door can be used as a big picture plane through which you can see three-dimensional
space condensed on the surface of the glass, and you can draw it right there for fun or to
see how things in space relate to each other.
Out and about, you can try looking at a landscape or a building through your car window,
for a moving picture plane. Try it to see a complicated bit of perspective, like a dock or
bridge, or look at a complicated roof. You will see that all the angles, shapes, and relative
scale that make landscape space look accurate is right there on your car window. As with
the sliding glass door, objects will appear quite small, but you will get the idea.
Use your car window to remind you that all you need to do is see and draw.
Perspective in Pieces 
Perspective can be dealt with in various ways:
Informal Perspective
➤Scale and relativity
➤Measuring and siting
➤Aerial perspective
We’ll look at each of these methods in a few pages. Formal

Scale in drawing is the rendering
of relative size. An object or per-
son or tree, as it is seen farther
away, will seem smaller than an-
other of the same size that is
closer.
The Art of Drawing
Van Gogh had to drag his perspective contraption out into the fields to use it. You can use the
window of your car and sit there, coffee for company, and draw right on the car window. Of
course, you can’t drive everywhere that you would like to be in order to draw, but you can use
the car window as a tool to learn to draw well enough so that, in time, you won’t need a tool
at all. Then you can go anywhere that your legs will carry you. Remember, NEVER sit in your car
with the motor running and the windows closed; make sure the engine is off—fumes and pollu-
tion are duel dangers, to you, and to the environment!

Let’s consider eye level as the key to understanding vanishing points
and one-point perspective. As you look at an object in a still life or the
corner of a room or out at a landscape, it is eye level, in your view and
on your paper, that most determines the actual image.
When drawing landscapes or things in perspective, the horizon line is
the line to which all planes and lines vanish. As you look out on a
landscape, you can be looking up at, straight at, or down at the view,
the horizon line, and the vanishing points, to which everything will
disappear (seem to get smaller).
You can think of eye level as how and where you are viewing the 
landscape—looking up, looking at, or looking down. In landscapes, eye
level is also referred to as the horizon line. Where you position yourself
and where you position the horizon or eye level in a drawing greatly
affect what you see and how you draw it.
Your eye level is your point of view relative to what you are looking at. Points begin to “vanish”
above or below the center, or “horizon” line. Notice how the perspective of the house changes
above, at, and below the horizon line.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Eye level, or the horizon line,
simply refers to your point of
view relative to what you are
looking at. It is the point at
which all planes and lines vanish.

Chapter 16 ➤What’s Your Perspective?
Now, let’s look at the three ways of viewing formal perspective.
➤One-point perspective is a single straight-on view into space. To envision one-point
perspective, look down a street, straight down a plowed field, or along a fence or a
tree-lined country lane. The road, the trees, the fences, or the rows in the field will
seem to vanish toward a central point straight out in front of you at eye level.
Above eye level
At the bottom of the pre-
vious page, and here, at
left are three drawings,
one executed at eye level,
one above eye level look-
ing down, and one below
eye level looking up.
Eye level
Single vanishing point
One-point perspective: View down a few
roads toward a central vanishing point. 
➤Two-point perspective is based on the fact that planes seen at an angle will recede in
space. They are directed toward vanishing points on either side of the horizon line or
eye level.

Part 5 ➤Out and About with Your Sketchbook
202
➤Three-point perspective adds a third vanishing point and represents a fairly radical
viewpoint. Try it after you have mastered informal, one-point, and two-point perspec-
tive.
Two-point perspective is
vanishing points on the
horizon or eye level.
Three-point perspective
adds height or depth, for
a radical view.

Lines of houses, buildings, fences, bridges, roads, trees, or anything else, seen at an

the picture itself. It can be easier to try to see perspective simply as angles in space
rather than needing to draw in the vanishing points.

Tools for Landscape and Perspective
When you’re out in the world drawing, being prepared is key to rendering perspective both
effectively and easily. Here are some helpful hints:
➤Sharpen lead pencils for landscape drawing with a sharp pocketknife or utility knife to
make a chisel point. It makes a unique mark that seems appropriate for landscape
work, but you may find that you like it for all sorts of draw-
ing, once you try it.
➤Be a scout when you are out and about. Take supplies so you
can enjoy yourself and get some work done.
➤When out drawing landscapes, take the time to look and find
the view that you really like. Don’t settle for the first spot
that you see.
➤Use your hand to frame your arrangement, composition, or
scene.
➤Take along a viewfinder frame and/or a plastic picture plane
to help. Draw a few boxes to match your viewfinder frame
ahead of time and use them with the frame to see your view.

You can decide how much you want to use formal perspective, with all the vanishing points
and lines, or whether you prefer to see relatively and just draw. Perspective always comes in
handy for difficult views and complicated buildings. Try to learn the basics and then decide as
you go.
1. Establishing your view is first, whether you’re inside or out. Try a
few fast thumbnail sketches to see if you like the shapes and an-
gles. Don’t worry much about perfection; just do them.
2. Decide on the view that you like and look at it. Decide where you
are relative to the view. Are you looking up, down, or straight at
the main part or center of interest in your drawing?
3. After you have established eye level and the horizon line lightly
on your drawing, you can begin to draw in the shapes you will
draw in perspective. Start with something simple like a cube.
Inside, a cube is easy to find; outside, pick a simple building, like
a cottage, to start.
4. Perspective is all about seeing planes in space, so you want to
begin with an object that is turned away from you, at an angle.
The sides of the object, cube, or cottage, will vanish, or get small-
er, as they go back away from you in space.
Learning to See, Measure, and Draw in Perspective
Perspective is not that hard, and for the more obsessive-compulsive of us, it is rather fun. So,
with the addition of a ruler to help with the lines, you are ready to try it.
1. Site your object on your paper and decide on your eye level or horizon line. Hold your
paper horizontal; it will give you more room.
➤Is your object correctly placed, relative to your eye level?
➤Is it above, at, or below eye level?
Draw it on your paper. Most times, you will site your cube or
cottage slightly below eye level, until you decide to draw the
castle on the hill or your fantasy mountaintop cabin. The sides
of your object will recede to points at the far sides of that line.
2. The first step in perspective is to measure the height of the object
you are going to draw on the paper. Look at the corner of the ob-
ject and measure the height of that nearest corner and draw it.
You can measure the height against your pencil with your thumb.
3. Draw two points on your horizon line or eye-level line at either
side of your paper.
4. Now, lightly draw lines from the top and bottom of your corner
to the points on either side. These lines represent the planes or
sides of your object vanishing in space. Easy, huh?
5. Next, you have to establish the length of those sides. Are they
equal? Which one is longer and how much? See them relatively,
and measure them with your pencil against the height, which
you have as an established “given.”
Try Your Hand
Try sketching a small thumbnail
version of a view to see how you
like it and decide whether you
should move to the side or look
from higher or lower to get an-
other vantage point. Try a view,
and move on and try another
until you are happy.
Back to the Drawing Board
If you were looking straight at the
middle of the side of your cube
or cottage, both horizontally and
vertically, you would see it as a
square or rectangle, with no van-
ishing point. But here you are in
the real world, where things are
at angles and the sides of things
tend to vanish to the points on
the horizon line or eye level.

205
Chapter 16 ➤What’s Your Perspective?
6. Draw vertical lines for the far ends of the two sides of your cube or cottage.
7. Draw in the top if you can see it. The sides of a rectangle vanish to the same point, so
you can draw in the light lines to make the top. See the following figure.
Not so hard, is it? The rest is just more of the same.
Closing the Roof
Let’s finish off your first perspective drawing and put a roof on that cottage or cube. A
roof—a simple one on a cottage or a cube, anyway—is another set of planes that are paral-
lel to one side wall of the structure and vanish to the same point.
The roof is also centered on the end wall of the structure, which means that you have to
determine the middle of the end wall. It’s easy!
1. Draw light diagonals in the end wall from corner to corner.
2. Then, draw a vertical line up through the X made by the di-
agonals. That line is the middle of the plane or wall seen in
space.
3. Measure the height of the roof, called the gable or peak, by
comparing it to your base unit, the near corner that you
measured to begin.
4. Draw in the peak of the roof.
5. Draw lines from that point down to the two top corners of
that side or plane, and you will have drawn the shape of the
gable end of the roof.
6. The ridge of the roof is the top. That line is parallel to the
side of the structure and vanishes to the same point. Draw a
line from the peak to the point where the side walls vanish.
That is the ridge line of the roof.
7. The far end of the roof meets the back corner of the struc-
ture and is roughly parallel to the front end of the roof. It
actually slants a bit more than the front end of the roof. See
if you can figure out how much.
We’ve drawn a cube in
perspective to illustrate
these steps.
Try Your Hand
Fences and walls can be seen as
long planes that vanish to a point.
If they change direction, then
they vanish to the other side.
A road or bridge can be seen like
a house. The road is a very flat
plane vanishing in space and a
bridge is a complicated structure,
but its parts vanish to one side or
the other.

206
From this point on, perspective is careful measuring and plotting of lines to position other
elements like windows, doors, and chimneys correctly, and drawing them so they vanish to
the right point. A complicated house has more shapes to draw, that’s all.
The more you practice simple shapes in perspective, the more you will see the angles and
relationships. In many cases, you will be able to estimate the angles for simple situations
and use the vanishing points for more complicated ones. Is a new career in architecture or
landscape planning in your future?

draw a simple house in
perspective? Lauren
(upper) and one of her
students (lower) give it 
a try.
Measure for Measure
When you’re working with informal perspective, measuring is key. Here are some aspects to
take into consideration:
1. Take measurements by holding up a pencil at an unvarying distance from your eyes.
Keeping it at arm’s length will keep it constant, and the constancy is important for
that single view.
2. Use the pencil to measure a line that can be your base by marking it along the length
of the pencil with your thumb.
3. Then, apply that measurement to gauge the relative ratio of another line, shape, or
space.
These lines and curves
are in ratio to the base
unit line.

207
Chapter 16 ➤What’s Your Perspective?
4. Establish the angles, measurements, and relations that are crucial to creating viable
space.
5. See where roads converge and bands of trees get smaller.
An angle measure helps you to see angles of perspective in space, so you don’t have to draw
in the vanishing points except in a really complicated piece. The more you draw, you’ll
learn to estimate vanishing points, and see them as angles. That will be close enough for a
lot of drawings.
The Art of Drawing
Find a unit of measurement, something that you can measure against your pencil or the view
finder frame, a base from which you can compare and measure other lengths. You’ll use this
base to compare other things, lines, and spaces in your composition.
Think about your base unit and what you want to measure against it as being in a ratio (1:1, 1:2,
1:3, 1:4, etc.). You can use the table below to help you determine lines and curves, or create
your own base unit.
Comparing the basic
unit of measurement
against other lengths.
The Art of Drawing
Make yourself an angle measure, just like the ones that carpenters use to measure angles. Fasten
two strips of mat board or cardboard together at one end with a brass fastener. Spread the strips
to mark a particular angle, a wide or narrow V shape, and transfer the angle to check your see-
ing and drawing of it.

208
A Few More Tips on Planes in Space
To determine the middle of a plane turned in space, such as the wall of a house to position a
door or window in the middle, or to find the middle of an end wall to position the roof,
draw diagonals in the rectangle that represents the wall or plane. This works whether the
plane is facing straight at you or at any angle, and whether it is above, at, or below eye level.
As in the figure below, a line drawn through the crossed diagonals and parallel to the verti-
cals will be in the middle. You can measure along the front of the plane to establish the
middle, and draw a line from that point through the crossed diagonals to the middle of the
other side.
Use a paper angle meas-
ure to see and transfer
angles to a drawing.
Some more points to consider:
➤You can divide a plane as many times as you want by drawing
successive sets of diagonals.
➤You can fit the curve of an arch into the rectangle after you
have centered it. It’s an easier way to draw it.
➤You can draw a dock or bridge and get all the piers correctly
placed by using diagonals to evenly break up the space.
➤You can divide a plane that is tilted in space, such as a roof, to
determine the middle, for placing the chimney or a dormer
correctly.
In a complicated street scene viewed straight across, such as the one below, most of the
planes can be facing square on. At the edges of your vision, however, things will start to
vanish to points at either side of the horizon or eye level, or to a center vanishing point.
Diagonals drawn
through a plane vanish-
ing in space establish
the center of the plane.

In a complicated scene viewed at an angle, like the one following, the various planes of

phone booths will be receding or vanishing to the two vanishing points at either side of
eye level.

rally after you have accurately drawn the basic shapes of the landscape and gotten a sense

➤The elements of a landscape, piece by piece
We need the tonic of wildness—we can never have enough of nature.
—Henry Thoreau
The land, in all its splendor, majesty, and complexity, has always fascinated artists. We all
seek a sense of place, and we relate to landscape images both because they are comfortable
and familiar and because they are exotic, unfamiliar, or even dangerous. We like them all.
And so the experience or drawing en plein air will both challenge and delight you and liter-
ally take you to a place you have never been.
Go Out for a View
Pack all your troubles in an old kit bag—and draw, draw, draw. That old song didn’t talk
about packing a bag for no reason. There’s nothing like getting out en plein air to get the cre-
ative juices flowing, to make you feel like you’re, well, getting out of the house—which you
are.
When you’re ready to get out of the house and begin trying your hand at some landscapes,
remember your supplies. Don’t forget your hat, use some sunscreen, wear a sweater, take a
jacket—do we sound like your mother? In addition, you may want to pack yourself a picnic
dinner, in anticipation of capturing that brilliant sunset landscape. 
But Which One?
You can look at a scene various ways and draw it differently each time. Claude Monet did
dozens of paintings of haystacks, from different angles, at different times of day, in different

light. The Sandia Mountains, east of Corrales, New Mexico, where Lisa lives, for example,
change from moment to moment, which is not always conducive to working on a deadline.
Lisa moved her desk several years ago so she doesn’t have a mountain view (she wasn’t get-
ting much done but mountain-viewing)—but she still finds a lot of excuses to get up and
see them anyway.
Eastern Long Island, New York, where Lauren lives, presents landscapes and seascapes that
change not only with the time of day, but every day. If there’s a particular landscape in
your worldview that captivates you, don’t be afraid to draw it again and again and capture
its elusiveness, like Monet.
A scene that seems familiar can present you with many variations. It is
for you to choose how to proceed. Landscape depiction can be broken
down into three scales:
1. Close-up studies of objects in nature are about the specimen, its
shape, proportion, detail, and texture.
2. In the middle, there is room for a view with some detail in the
foreground, objects, foliage, and/or structures in the middle
ground, and a sense of space behind.
3. The big picture is about space, vistas, and purple mountains’
majesty.
Faraway views might have some foreground detail, but are about the
sense of space in the view. Aerial perspective, the progressive softening
of color, detail, and distinctness in deep space, helps suggest that dis-
tance. You’ll find more detail on aerial perspective in Chapter 16,
“What’s Your Perspective?”
Framing the View
Once you have decided on the distance from which you are seeing your view or scene, then
you have to decide exactly what piece of the panorama you will draw. You can’t fit it all in,
you know.
Artist’s Sketchbook
En plein air is a French term
meaning “full of fresh air.” It
refers here to painting done out-
of-doors. Because classic painting
had been done in studios, paint-
ing outside was a radical move.
The Art of Drawing
Remember Euclid’s notion of dividing the space from Chapter 9, “Step Up to a Still Life:
Composition, Composition, Composition”? He divided space so that the point of central interest
was slightly off center in both directions. This is an excellent example to follow when it comes
to landscape drawing.
Use your viewfinder frame to scope out the view and crop the view until you decide. 
Move it from side to side and look at the different variations on what you see. Look at the

215
Chapter 17 ➤This Land Is Your Land
diagonals in the landscape as you decide. Try to find a view that draws you into the scene
and is a balanced but interesting composition.
Your thumbnail sketches will help rule out arrangements or views that are less interesting.
On the Line—the Horizon Line
As we discussed in Chapter 16 and earlier, any accurate seeing and drawing of three-
dimensional space begins with eye level or the horizon line. Situating yourself in space
determines the vantage point from which you will be seeing and drawing the landscape.
You can be looking up at, straight out at, or down on a view and the drawings will be quite
different. You can see the difference by making small sketches of a particular place or view
from different viewpoints. Try it and see:
➤Sit on the ground.
➤Sit in a chair or on a rock.
➤Stand up.
➤Climb on your car, a rock, or up a tree to see the scene change as you change where
you are.
On the Page: Siting Your View
How you position your view on the page will also greatly affect the composition and how
effective your drawing is when finished, so take some time to position the image to its best
advantage at the start.
Landscapes have high horizons, middle horizons, or low horizons that
affect the view and the sense of space.
➤If you want a sense of deep space, you can move the horizon
line higher on your page. There will be more foreground and
the horizon will feel farther away.
➤If you want to concentrate on the sky, move the horizon line
down farther on the page, somewhat compressing the fore-
ground, middle ground, and background space.
➤You can leave it in the middle or anywhere in between that
suits you and what you are trying to do with your landscape.
Some Thoughts on Landscape Space
As with any kind of drawing, landscape presents its own special set of considerations:
➤Strong horizontals in the landscape make a better composition.
➤See and use winding roads or fences to lead the eye into your world. Remember to
draw fences and hedgerows or lines of vegetation in a field.
➤Shapes of hills overlap in interesting ways.
➤Identify the center of interest—what you are trying to show about the view that you
see. Think of a visual story. Set a scene into the composition, then add other elements
and some detail.

Tools for Landscape and Perspective
As we’ve suggested previously, sharpen lead pencils for landscape drawing with a sharp
pocketknife or utility knife to make a chisel point. It makes a unique mark that seems ap-
propriate for landscape work.
Also, be a scout when you are out and about. Take supplies so you can enjoy yourself and
get some work done. Include as much as you think you will need and then some. Be pre-
pared, in other words.
When out drawing landscapes, take the time to look and find the view that you really like.
Don’t settle for the first spot that you see.
Use your hand to frame your arrangement, composition, or scene. Take along a viewfinder
frame and or a plastic picture plane to help. Draw a few boxes to match your viewfinder
frame ahead of time and use them with the frame to see your view.
Seeing and Drawing the Landscape
Try sketching a small thumbnail version of a view to see how you like it, and to determine
whether you should move to the side or look from higher or lower to get another vantage
point. Consider the following as you draw your small thumbnail version; these points will
help when you get to your larger drawing as well:
1. Try a view and move on and try another until you are happy.
2. Drawing the landscape starts with the horizon line or eye level, then moves on to big
land forms.
3. Making things in the landscape sit down and stay put is merely
seeing and drawing them in space. Usually if there is a prob-
lem, it is in maintaining a consistent eye level and drawing
things at their relative place above, at, or below eye level.
4. Use your experience with perspective, either informal observ-
ing, measuring, and drawing of the angles in a structure, or for-
mal perspective and vanishing points, or a hybrid of the two.
5. Find and draw intersecting wedges of land as interesting
shapes.
6. Use tone to define big shapes before adding detail.
Aerial perspective helps a great deal in establishing deep space. This
can be achieved by allowing the far distance to be less distinct and
softer in color, tone, and detail.
Detail up close, on the other hand, is stronger and clearer, more color-
ful, and full of tone or contrast.
Whether you’re rendering close-up detail or distant perspective, you
can use the tear-out reference card checklist to remind you of the steps
toward a drawing.
Back to the Drawing Board
One reason why trees are poorly
drawn is because so few artists
have realized the need for study-
ing their formation and growth,
both as groups and as individuals.
When you see them as you do
people or animals—having ges-
tures, proportion, and shape, as
well as growth patterns that will
determine how they look and
how you draw them—your draw-
ing will improve tremendously.

Photographs: To Use or Not to Use, That Is the
Question
Photographs can help with detail, but not really to learn to see and draw. If you go out to
sketch and draw, by all means take along your camera for detail—but don’t rely on it exclu-
sively. You can annotate your drawing using the photo and put in areas of detail rather
than the whole picture’s worth, but it’s better to draw in order to capture what is important
to you.
The Landscape in Pieces
Elements in the landscape become part of the whole, but can be considered separately to
learn more about each of them. So you can think of the landscape in pieces, we’ve taken a
landscape apart so you can consider those pieces before they become part of the whole.
Trees and Shrubs
As with roses, a tree is not a tree is a tree, it is the tree, the one that you are drawing. It must
be seen as an individual. When you think of the tree as an individual, almost like a person,
you’ll discover that it has both gesture and direction. It has its own proportion and shape,
from tall, columnar evergreens to wide, spreading oaks.
Every tree has a character
all its own.

Foliage is another detail that needs special attention. Don’t draw a head of broccoli like
painters used to before en plein air painting became popular and artists started really looking
at trees. Of course, if you can’t see those individual leaves, it’s possible you need new glasses
or contacts.
Trees present a myriad of possibilities for texture, composition, perspective, and light and
shadow studies.

A Tangle of Textures, Vines, and Grasses
Vines and underbrush are great fun to draw; you can get as lost in the drawing as you can
get out in the underbrush itself. Pick a place that has a lot of complexity, but some kind of
structural device that frames or limits the tangle.
A stone wall or some large branches can work well to frame a mess of underbrush. A trellis
or arch will support a massive vine, and you’ll get an interesting contrast between the
curves of the vines and the architecture of the trellis. Follow these tips when drawing this
type of foliage:
➤Draw the vines or the tangle lightly at first.
➤Start seeing the overlaps of branches and the twining of vines as you draw them.
➤Use tone to emphasize where one branch goes over or under another.
➤Work in some flowers when you can. They are set off by the underbrush nicely.
➤Play with the tones of the background. This will greatly help to set off and define the
complexity of the tangle.
➤You can squint or blur your vision as you work on the background. You will see the
beginnings of shapes behind shapes that you can define into more tangle in the back-
ground. How far you go is up to you.
Wrap a few vines around your drawing pencil.

Chapter 17 ➤This Land Is Your Land
➤Grass is a lovely addition, but it needs to move like grass, not look like a rug. Think
about direction, gesture, and texture.
Grass is as individual as
any landscape feature.
Beaches, Rocks, and Cliffs
Rocks are wonderful elements in the landscape. They can be playful, formal, architectural,
massive … you name it. When you start drawing rocks and dunes, think about form,
shape, space, volume, weight, and texture.

Water and Reflections
Water, water, everywhere—it’s easier than you think. Bodies of water need to sit flat, which
means eye level and an elliptical curve in the bank or shoreline that works like the edge of
a big dish out there in the landscape. Some things to consider as you draw water:
➤Think about eye level and making the water lay flat like a dish in space, then add light
and flickering texture.
➤Reflections are fun, just see them and draw them like the objects themselves.
➤Think about pattern on a surface you’ve already drawn—it could generate an entirely
different drawing.
Even though it’s not
drawn, the sky above
these cliffs is an impor-
tant landscape feature.
It’s about space—the ab-
sence or presence of—as

The Best for Last: The Small Things
It is no secret that Lauren prefers the small things in nature to the big picture. She spent
her childhood hikes looking at the ground, and nothing has changed. The detail in small
individual specimens has always fascinated her, and it may be the view that you like best 
as well.
Capturing reflections on water can add interest and detail
to your drawing.

225
Chapter 17 ➤This Land Is Your Land
Wherever you go, look for the small things, and get to know them as you draw them:
➤In the woods and mountains, there are delicate wildflowers in the spring; at the 
higher altitudes, they are there most of the summer.
➤Mushrooms are some of the most erotic, sensuous shapes out there. They can be fun
to arrange on a page as if they were talking in a group.
➤Lichens, mosses, and other fungi are there for the seeing and drawing. Even the galls
on tree branches are interesting. They are made by the tree or leaf in response to a
bug’s trying to burrow in to lay eggs, and every tree makes a different one.
➤The woodland wildflowers could occupy a lifetime of drawing only they, from the del-
icate mayflower and Solomon’s seal to the exotic jack-in-the-pulpit and lady’s slipper.
All have their own story.
➤The seashore is a treasure trove of goodies to see and draw. The complexity of
seashells, the funky shapes of crabs, the structure of big pieces of driftwood, the tex-
ture of seaweed, shore plants, and the unending rocks are all waiting for you.
As Your Drawing Progresses
Balancing all the elements of your landscape is a juggling act, but you can use your tear-out
reference card checklist at the front of this book to help. Remember that you don’t have to
fill in every inch of the page to get a good drawing. Remember, too, that you don’t have to
finish each drawing the same way or the same amount.
Light, Shadow, Atmosphere, and Contrast
Look at tones, the lights, and shadows in a landscape. As you do, consider the following:
➤Strong shadows can be interesting—but they can be confusing, too.
➤Make sure that you can see the main shapes of the landscape.
➤Remember to balance the foreground detail with the amount of space you are trying
for.
➤Experiment with suggesting tone rather than filling it all in everywhere, or changing
the tone of an area for greater contrast.
A study of driftwood on

There are endless ways to finish a drawing. No two drawings will ever end quite the same
way—it’s part of the fun.
Detail Is, As Always, Detail
Careful study of individual landscape elements will make it easier and easier to draw them
into the view you have selected. The more you draw trees, the better your trees will look,
and so it goes.
➤Try drawings that are about big land shapes, and try drawings that are about intersect-
ing wedges of land or belts of trees or bands of rocks in interesting patterns.
➤Try drawings of small corners of your world—a favorite place or a hidden refuge, for
example.
➤Try to see trees as individuals. Think of them as wood spirits having their portrait
drawn.
Most of all, find the little things in the woods, in the mountains, in the fields, or at the
beach that are the tokens or talismans of the place. Bring them home and draw them. That
way, you can treasure them always.

➤Adding human-made elements to your landscapes
➤In the countryside
➤On the waterfront
➤Trains and boats and planes
Some of the most unusual adventures I have ever had came as by-products of casual sketching
trips made after breakfast on days off from my newspaper work. It is a hobby that leads to
queer and uncommon human contacts.
—Clayton Hoagland
Not everything in our world was made by Mother Nature, and human-made elements are
just about everywhere you look. Whether it’s a fence crossing a field, a sailboat rocking in
an inlet, or a satellite tower topping a mountain, the things made by humans can add a sur-
prising dimension to your landscape.
Evidence of Human Influence
Of course, there are landscapes without human-made elements, but they are getting harder
and harder to find. These days, the human influence seems to be almost everywhere we
look, even if it’s only the winding road we are looking out at in the distance.
Making peace with human-made elements in your landscape drawings is not so bad. In fact,
you can use the many human-made things in your landscape to frame and order the space,
draw the eye into your composition, or add contrast and textural detail. At the same time,
some human-made elements are more attractive than others, and there are some you’ll defi-
nitely want to leave out.

Roads, Fences, Gates, and Walls
Roads, walls, and fences are parts of the landscape that can add direction, interest, and 
vitality to a scene or view. A road, wall, or fence meandering away within a grouping of
winding hills can add drama and narrative to a drawing. A half-open gate can make viewers
wish they knew what lay beyond it and stimulate the imagination.

In the Farmyard
You have only to go outside on a farm and you will find something
to draw—and sometimes, you don’t even have to go outside.
Whether you are on a big farm in the Midwest with lots of equip-
ment and big fenced fields, or a little family farm in New England
with a big garden, a few chickens, cows, and an ancient old tractor,
you will find something interesting to draw.
Haystacks worked for Monet, and as you travel around the country-
side you will see the various shapes and sizes in different areas of
the country. Big barns are the norm in Vermont, for example, while
the bigger structures in Nebraska are the silos for harvested corn.
Corrals and farmyards enclose areas and make interesting angles
and shapes. The animals themselves we will deal with in Chapter
20, “It’s a Jungle Out There—So Draw It!” They deserve a chapter of
their own, after all.
Try Your Hand
Using your viewfinder frame to
help compose the mainland masses
in a landscape, take certain
human-made elements, such as
roads, fences, and walls, to make
the difference between an ordinary
drawing and an extraordinary one.

Sheds and barns are technically structures and so are covered in Chapter
19, “Houses and Other Structures,” but you’ll want to be sure to include
them with all that you find when drawing on a farm. You can sneak a
peek ahead if you’d like some helpful hints for how to draw them.
Special Uses, Special Structures
And then there are all the unusual erections in the landscape, from
mountaintop warming huts to lighthouses on rocky shores, just waiting
to challenge you and enliven your drawings. If you are out and about
and feel like creating an unusual drawing, try one of the more striking
structures that decorate the landscape. Lighthouses, windmills, and tow-
ers add height, but they can also be the focus of an interesting drawing.
For you outdoorsy types, there are huts, sheds, cabins, fishing shacks,
lean-tos, tents, and campers—as well as log footbridges, trail cairns, and
forest service and Bureau of Land Management signs.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Cairns are human-made trail
markings, most often piles of
rocks that mark the trailside path.
Adding these mini-structures to
your drawing can lead the viewer
onto the trail, too.
Some of the more un-
usual items in the land-
scape may be waiting
around the corner for
you to draw, such as
this lighthouse. 
A little closer to home, you could draw in your yard and try a tree house, screen house,
gazebo, or even your hammock hanging between two trees. Or, for the city dweller: fire 
hydrants, parking meters, parking lot shanties, garbage cans, even 
traffic signals.
On the Dock of the Bay and Beyond
Whether near the water, on the water, or in the water, you will usually
find human-made things along with the natural. From canoes on a
quiet lake in the Adirondacks to trawlers at the commercial dock in
Montauk to sailboats in the Caribbean to the ocean liner you are on in
the middle of the Atlantic, boats are there for you to include in your
drawings to add to the sense of adventure.
Docks, Harbors, and Shipyards
Docks and shipyards are challenging places to draw. A dock needs to be
drawn carefully, and there is a lot to measure. Once you get the main
plane of the dock drawn in space, use crossing diagonals to divide the
space equally and then again and again for the piers or pilings.
Try Your Hand
If you can get your car close to a
dock, try drawing it on your car
window (a moving plastic picture
plane). You can see the progres-
sion of the piers and the per-
spective of the walkway leading
out into the water. Do it for fun
and make a tracing if you like it.

Chapter 18 ➤Made by Man: Out in the Landscape
The activity in a boatyard can be daunting, but if you enjoy the subject, you will find a way
to frame an amount of the activity that you can handle. Your viewfinder frame will come in
handy for this. Plus, don’t hesitate to filter out unwanted objects and detail. This is called
“artistic liberty.”
The Art of Drawing
A boat can add just the right touch to a landscape. You might try sketching a fishing trawler
overflowing with fish, just back from a day at sea, or a canoe tucked against the shore, waves
lapping at its side. As an experiment, leave the humans out of the picture (also because we
won’t be discussing how to draw them until Chapters 21 and 22); you’ll find that human-made
things without the men can make your drawing come alive in surprising ways.

The World of Vehicles
They may or may not be your favorite things, but our landscape is
crisscrossed from end to end with roads, train tracks, the bridges
over them, underpasses under them, and tunnels to get to the
other side. A little wood bridge over a walkway might be more to
your liking, or you may enjoy the challenge of a suspension bridge
or a mountain pass with a tunnel going off somewhere. Try what-
ever appeals to you, with or without vehicles.
Bridges, Trains, and Tracks
Tunnels and covered bridges and overpasses are everywhere, in 
the city and the country. They can be the classic Vermont covered
bridge, a tunnel through the mountains in Colorado, or the
Golden Gate Bridge—the choice is yours.
Back to the Drawing Board
Boats need to lie flat in the water.
There is nothing more awkward
than a boat that won’t stay in the
water where it belongs. Try drawing
a box in space for the boat and
then put the boat in the box. You
may want to refer back to Chapter

a Test,” where we discussed drawing
a box around a more difficult ob-
ject to help you draw it.

Moving Vehicles
Then there are the moving human-made elements like trucks, cars, fire engines, buggies,
wagons, tractors, and merry-go-rounds. You can think of even more, we are sure. Take a
look at some of these vehicles that Lauren has drawn. Vehicles provide a contrast between
hard angles and geometric shapes in the manmade world, and the often more fluid forms
and contours of nature. Place a person or two in the landscape and you’ve included the link
between both worlds!

➤When is a house not a home?
➤Getting your house to stand
➤Building perspective
➤From shingles to bricks
The artist’s ability lies first in seeing the picture before he has begun it.
—Clayton Hoagland
Houses fascinate us. After all, we all live in a house of some kind, whether it’s a tall apart-
ment building, a small ranch, a lovely Cape Cod, a farmhouse, an old Victorian with lots of
gingerbread trim, a cottage on the beach, an old funky adobe, or a modern, sculptural man-
sion.
Whether it’s drawing a house or another building, the most important thing, as Clayton
Hoagland notes, is to first “see.” In this chapter, you’ll learn how to do just that.
A World of Buildings
Houses, barns, sheds, and other structures are perhaps the most prevalent elements in land-
scape drawings and paintings. They are almost everywhere you look, so, of course, they’ll
find their way into much of what you draw as well.
City Mice and Country Mice
Whichever kind of mouse you are and whatever kind of house you choose to draw, you will
encounter largely the same challenges and problems.

Seeing your view (the vantage point, eye level, framing, and format on the page)
and the accurate transferring of your view to the page is the same, whatever the
subject and detail.

Chapter 19 ➤Houses and Other Structures
The Old and the New
Whether your house is an old charmer, a stunning modern, or anywhere in between, you
can make a drawing that is a portrait of all its special qualities. Draw your house at different
times of year as well, and get some of those landscape and garden elements in. Trees, in par-
ticular, change from season to season, and can change the way a house looks dramatically.
Old or new, every house has
something unique to recom-
mend it. On your next trip
abroad, take along a sketch-
book to study perspective in
centuries’ old forms and
structures. You’ll get some
great drawing practice, and
have a wonderful travel
journal through which to re-

Making It Stand
Start with simple houses and barns and sheds. Then move on to more
complicated structures or street scenes. Of course, you have to begin
with decisions about vantage point, eye level, framing your image,
your format, and position on the page.
Whether you are looking up, at, or down at your subject will affect all
that you see. Some of the ways you can view a house include
➤Up under the roof to see all the detail under the eaves.
➤Straight at the house, concentrating on doors and window trim.
➤Down on the roof from above.
Of course, those are only three suggestions. Be creative—view a house
through a window, or past a tree. The possibilities are endless.
Try Your Hand
Take your time when drawing a
house—and take the time to
draw it more than once, at dif-
ferent times of year.
Informal perspective is great for quick, casual sketches of houses. Take a look at how individual drawing
styles and drawing materials produce different results!
Informal Perspective
For a casual sketch of a house or an exploratory drawing to decide on a view or framing or
format, you can observe and draw the main angles in a house by carefully establishing a
base unit of measurement and some basic angles.

245
Chapter 19 ➤Houses and Other Structures
Then, add to your drawing as you can see the relation between each part. Draw carefully
and check all the relative parts of the structure before you begin the detail.
Formal Perspective
When you want to be more formal, begin with eye level and a light siting of your house on
the page. Then, draw in your vanishing points and begin to draw the planes of the house in
perspective. You can refer to the steps in Chapter 16 if you’d like some help as you go.
Keeping the Pieces in Proportion
Whether your drawing is an informal sketch or architectural rendering, you will need to
measure carefully for doors, windows, and any other trim details that you draw to keep
them in scale and evenly arranged. You can use the steps on the tear-out reference card if
you’d like some help with this.
You can copy famous 
architectural structures
from high quality 
images in books or 
periodicals to gain more
insights into formal 
perspective.

Using diagonals to divide a house plane will assure accurate placement of the win-
dows and doors.
It’s in the Details
Windows, doors, roofs, stoops, railings, steps, gutters, soffits, overhangs, patios, porches,
pools, and ponds—these are the details that houses (and yards) are made of. Go for a close-
up view and render one of those details in particular. Even a crack in the adobe can make
for an interesting close-up house drawing.

In the City
Skyscraping apartment towers, modest brownstones, and elegant townhouses are in almost
every city, along with office buildings, factories, and warehouses. They can present an inter-
esting street scene or skyline with lots of city detail.
You can soften the linear
quality of a cityscape
with rooftop gardens,
window boxes, front-
stoop planters, sidewalk
gardens, or a city park
background. The highly
articulated perspective
relationships don’t over-
power the drawing.
In the Country
The countryside is a haven for artists and poets, wherever they find it. The peace and tran-
quility are both inspiration and subject. In the country you’ll find the time, the space, and

Part 5 ➤Out and About with Your Sketchbook

the peace to work creatively. Try to give yourself the gift of time in the country, even if you
think that you live in the country already.
Look for houses in the country that reflect an open-to-nature quality. Find yourself a fan-
tasy farmhouse—the Victorian of your dreams or the Adirondack lodge that you’ve always
wanted—and draw it. Who knows? It might be a way of visualizing it into your life. But be
careful what you wish for, you might get it.
Here’s the country house
of Lauren’s dreams. Try
drawing your own dream
house, too. You might
even get what you 
wish for! Country and
farmhouses blend archi-
tectural elements with a
functional integration
into the landscape.
Materials and Techniques
The materials and textures used to build your house need their own marks to differentiate
them. Cedar shingles, clapboards, rough cedar siding, smooth aluminum siding, brick, stone,
metal, and stucco are a few of the materials that can be represented by tones and marks.
Experiment with different pencils to render different house textures on the page. The
medium you choose can assist you in rendering that wood or stone facade.

249
Chapter 19 ➤Houses and Other Structures
Period Pieces and Special Places
Period pieces and special places present their own special interests—and issues. Decide what
you are going after before you begin. If you intend to add a lot of elaborate detail, you will
probably need to begin with an accurate base, drawn in formal perspective.
For sketches, even a house with lots of gingerbread trim can be
drawn loosely with a minimum of perspective. As with any house,
it will be in the details that you find a classic house’s particular in-
terest.
Classical Beauty
Architectural detail can be sketchy and suggested or it can be 
very precise, requiring a lot of measuring and planning. Here are
some helpful hints to guide you as you begin to draw those classic
beauties.
➤A front view of a Victorian with gingerbread trim can be care-
fully and lightly sketched by measuring with a pencil held
out at arm’s length. Once you are pleased with the placement
and proportion of the windows and doors, you can begin to
add the trim detail and be reasonably certain that you will
end up with an attractive loose rendering.

➤Remember to look for interesting structures like arches, arbors, pergolas, gazebos, 
elaborate screen houses, greenhouses, and wraparound porches. They require careful
seeing and drawing, but they make great subjects and can add a sense of place or 
atmosphere to a scene.
Down on the Farm
Drawing farmhouses invites detail. There is so much going on and, seemingly, a structure
for each activity—from maple sugar shacks out in the woods in Vermont to huge dairy
barns in New York State, from cattle ranches in Idaho to windblown, abandoned farmsteads
in Nebraska. There are small family farms, citrus groves, tree farms, truck farms, and im-
mense factory farms.
Try drawing the barns, silos, and sheds in a farmyard. Fences, corrals, and stone walls will
add interesting diagonals and texture while defining the land shapes and inviting the view-
er into the composition. You won’t run out of structures to draw on a farm for some time.

The Least You Need to Know
➤Houses are fascinating to draw and there is no shortage of them in the landscape.
➤Informal sketches can accurately describe a house and its personality if they are care-
fully seen, measured relatively, and drawn progressively from the basic shapes to the
finished detail.
➤A formal rendering in perspective is another kind of portrait.
➤Try drawing houses into your landscapes, especially on trips, so you can include styles
and detail that are unusual.
➤Don’t forget about the exciting, exotic, and estrange in your choices of houses to
draw. Why stay home when you can go have an adventure—and draw it, too?

Part 6
Drawing Animals 
and People
It’s time to start putting some life into your drawings, and in this section, you’ll learn to draw
both animals and humans. Both require seeing the action and gesture, then the proportion and
form, followed by detail. 
Learn why the nude has always been the object of artists’ affections—and why it may turn out
to be yours as well. You’ll also learn about gesture and movement, and how to render them on
the page.

➤Drawing animals
➤First, gesture
➤Then shape
➤Detail and scale
Animals = action. These two words go hand in hand in art. Their lives are of necessity active
and their activities are reflected in an alert grace of line, even when they are in repose or
asleep. Indeed, because of their markings, many animals appear to be awake when they are
sleeping, and many mammals sleep so lightly that even when apparently asleep they will
move their ears in the direction of a sound that is inaudible to us. So there is always a feeling
of perpetual motion about animals, and to draw them successfully this must be borne in
mind.
—Alexander Calder
Interior and exterior landscapes are one thing, but now it’s time to populate your drawings.
Whether it’s animals or people, re-creating living things on the page takes both practice and
patience.
As Alexander Calder points out, animals = action. Capturing that action is the first step in
creating dynamic animal drawings.
Drawing Animals
Earliest man covered the walls of caves with drawings of animals in a basic attempt to know
them, relate to them, hunt them, revere them, use them, learn from them, dominate them,
and celebrate them. Unlike the spears and arrows that appear next to them in these ancient
drawings, animals continue today to be among artists’ favorite drawing subjects.
You may want to let your sleeping dog lie, but there’s no reason you can’t draw him while
he does. But how do you draw a sleeping dog—or a running horse? Let’s find out.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People

In a World of Action, Gesture Is First
Alexander Calder was a keen observer of nature as well as a draftsman who saw
and captured the essence of each animal he drew. As Calder himself notes, he
looked for the basic action, posture, and gesture of an animal as the foundation of
a drawing.
When you begin to draw animals, take plenty of time to see
the action and gesture. In your first drawings, you may only
get a gesture or a direction the animal is moving, but in time
you will be able to add form and detail to an active base that
really feels like the animal you were drawing.
Basic Proportions and Shapes
Let’s begin by getting those basic proportions and shapes on
paper.
1. Once you have your subject framed and your paper
and pencil ready, start with a few gesture or action
lines that represent the main limbs and direction of
movement.
2. When you have an idea of how the animal moves, try
to find a base unit of measurement, like the width of
the head, the length of the body, or the height from
the ground to the chest, and use that as a reference
point.
3. Measure that shape, space, or length and see how it
relates to other measurements on the body.
4. See the relation between the height and the length of
the animal, its legs, how high they are, and how long
the body is relative to the legs. Look at the head rela-
tive to the neck, the chest relative to the girth of the
body, and the size of the head.
Try Your Hand
The more you draw animals, the
more at ease you will be with
their particular proportions and
typical ways of moving.
This giraffe and ele-
phant are reduced to
the basic geometric
shapes that define
how they look.
Try Your Hand
Fill page after page in your
sketchbook with fast sketches of
animals. Try drawing a part at a
time, rather than the whole ani-
mal at once.

259
Chapter 20 ➤It’s a Jungle Out There—So Draw It!
5. Next, think of the body as a collection of spare parts drawn as geometric shapes of
various sizes and on various angles, relative to each other.
6. Look for ovals, ellipses, ellipsoids, cylinders, cones, and spheres. Think of the hard-
edged shapes, too, then round them off.
7. See the barrel shape of an elephant’s big body, the long curving cylinder or cone of its
trunk, the even longer, curving neck of a giraffe, the slender ellipses that make up the
shapes of a deer.
8. Try to draw each part of the body as a three-dimensional part, not a flat shape. Using
ovals and ellipses in light lines helps you think, see, and draw round, full shapes for
the body parts.
Quick drawings of animals concentrate on gesture and on the shape of basic body parts.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
260
Bulking Them Up
Once you are acquainted with an animal’s basic shapes and gestures, you can begin to add
some form and bulk to your drawing. Even a delicate deer or a slender bird’s leg has some
form.
Look at where shapes on the animal over- or underlap. As with inanimate objects, the way
one part goes over or under another defines the shapes and how they fit together.
Use tone, and your experience with it, to shade some of the main muscle and body shapes
and how they meet.
Lauren’s students use tone to shade and highlight animal muscle and body shapes.
Fur and Feathers, Skin and Scales
Snakes and snails and puppy dogs’ tails are only a few of the reasons you will want to add
texture to your animal drawings.

261
Chapter 20 ➤It’s a Jungle Out There—So Draw It!
Your practice with marks, tonal charts with different textures, and a willingness to try out
some new marks will pay off here.
A sensitivity to the individual animal and its unique qualities is a good start. Think about
the conditions a particular animal has to live in, how they live, how they feed or hunt,
what the dangers are, and how they have to adapt. Try to use your thoughts as you render
the fur, feathers, skin, and scales.
Being sensitive to an animal’s unique qualities, practicing with different textures, and a willingness to ex-
periment will pay off with realistic animal drawings. Two of Lauren’s students try their hands at a rabbit
and a dog.
Go Out Where They Are
You will find animals to draw the minute you go out into your yard, or sit at your window.
Your new drawing subjects will greet you everywhere you go, so be ready to grab your
sketchbook!
Your Backyard and in the Neighborhood
Our backyards are full of animal subjects—birds, butterflies, squirrels, chipmunks, as well as
frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, and snails. Because they are busy with their own lives, they are

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
262
disinclined to pose for you, but you can make quick sketches to capture first the action and
gesture, then the proportion, shape, and form.
If you live in the country and can sit quietly in your yard, you may be lucky enough to spot
deer, a fox, even a coyote; the big guys like bears and mountain lions, you should probably
draw from inside.
Animal subjects are as close as your backyard. How does your animal subject deter-
mine or relate to your drawing’s composition? Add the human element, and you’ve got
something wonderful!

263
Chapter 20 ➤It’s a Jungle Out There—So Draw It!
Field and Stream, Mountain and Lake
All the pretty places that you may think of for landscape drawings are also great for animal
studies. The seashore, for example, offers a constantly changing mix of shells and seashore
life. Some of that life you can even bring home to work on later, while some of it (shells,
for example) will have to stay outside or be soaked in a little mild bleach to clean it.
When your mate wants to go fishing, don’t stay home; take your sketchbook and draw the
fish, seashore life, or water birds.
The shore can offer up an
interesting array of still
life subjects—both living
and inert. After that
oceanscape, do some
studies of the smaller
creatures and objects the
scene holds within it.
Shells are a particularly
good subject for practicing
how to render texture,
while also mastering
some challenging shapes.
Natural History Museums and Centers
At the natural history museum, you will find everything you can think of, from a look
under a microscope to a dinosaur’s skeleton, as well of lots of books to study. Knowing
roughly how an animal’s skeleton works will make those action and gesture lines mean
more. The business of adding form and weight will come more easily the more you study,
so check it out.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
264
Farms, Stables, and Parks
Go out and draw the chickens, ducks, cows, goats, pigs, donkeys, horses, ponies—and don’t
forget all the babies. Drawing domestic animals is a great way to practice drawing animals
in relation to each other. When you draw more than one of the same animal, you begin to
discover how the animal moves according to its particular anatomy, and how to render dif-
ferent positions convincingly. With time, a certain arch of the neck or turn of the ear can
become second-nature to your drawing hand.
Practice drawing animal
skeletons—wherever you
find them. Take a trip to
the local natural history
museum, if need be, or
copy them out of natu-
ral science books and
magazines. Skeletons
can really help you un-
derstand the foundation
of a living creature’s
form, as well as its nat-
ural actions and ges-
tures.

265
Chapter 20 ➤It’s a Jungle Out There—So Draw It!
Zoos, Circuses, and Animal Petting Parks
A zoo is a great place to draw. You have it all there—not just the
wild animals, but their habitats as well. You’ll also find gardens,
trees, walkways, arches, fences, water, fountains, kids, parents,
lovers, and, for your comfort and pleasure, restrooms and food
nearby. They may even have Starbucks by now. Get your drawing
equipment and go camp out for a day. Then you can do it all—
and draw it, too.
Safaris
Safaris can be close to home or the adventure of a lifetime.
Almost any trip can be turned into a part-time safari. It’s more a
change in your attitude than the altitude. If you can’t get as far as
you’d like, repair to a zoo or a museum. If you get the chance to
try Tibet or a jaunt in the Australian outback, when it comes to
your sketchbook, don’t leave home without it!
Animal Portraits
An animal portrait can be a casual sketch that captures the person-
ality of the animal, but often it is an attempt to get a more formal
treatment and likeness.
Draw animals in groups to discover how their shape and gesture resonates when there’s more than one.
How do animal groups inform your drawing’s composition? What about putting animals into your land-
scape? Think about the positive and negative space relationship when drawing animals in groups. 
Back to the Drawing Board
You will find lots of reference ma-
terial out there: books, magazines,
stock photos, clip art, and Inter-
net photos, to name a few. They
can be handy, but will not be the
best way to learn to see and draw.
Looking at a flat image is not the
way to practice shape and form.
Even detail is best seen for real
and then drawn. Use the world of
reference and photos only when
you really need them, and try to
see your way rather than copying
the flatness.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
266
To do an animal portrait, start with the basics: gesture, proportion, and form. Then add as
much detail as you feel you can see.
For rendering more exotic animals from
life, instead of from books, try visiting
the circus or zoo. You’ll be practicing
new animal shapes and forms, while ex-
ploring other fun and interesting drawing
challenges, such as the tents shown in
this illustration.
Look at what happens when you draw
the animal using texture as the tech-
nique that illuminates the defining
shapes. Here, you see a bear and two
badgers.
When studying animal forms, try to capture just the shape to tell you
what animal is being rendered. Pay attention to positive and negative
spaces. Which animals do you see here?

267
Chapter 20 ➤It’s a Jungle Out There—So Draw It!
Problems in Portraiture
When your pet will sit, but not for a portrait, what then? You can wait for a sleeping sub-
ject, or you can work on a series of regular poses the animal often strikes, adding a bit of
shape, form, and detail as you can see it.
If your pet won’t sit for you, you expect an elephant to do it?
You might be surprised at a zoo and find that a wild animal will
be a willing subject. Many of them spend afternoons in relative re-
pose, so if you can find a pose you like, you might get lucky.
A Bit on Materials and Techniques
Our focus has been on seeing and drawing animals, including the
gesture, proportion, shapes, and form that make each species
unique. Detail is the textures and patterns, and the colors and sur-
face tones that are particular or peculiar to that animal—from the
soft blotchy fur of a fawn, to the smooth pelt of a seal, thick fur of
a husky, slippery skin of a frog, rough hide of a buffalo, shiny
scales of a fish, or the horny plates of that rhino on safari.
Experimenting with all your materials and trying new ones as you
see them is the best way to expand your vocabulary of marks and
textures. Look at someone else’s work (ask them if you can), or
just stand there and try to imagine how they made a certain tone
or texture. The more you practice yourself, the easier you will find
it to identify a particular kind of mark or material. As always, let
the real seeing and drawing of the animal come first.
Back to the Drawing Board
Photographs, as a reference, can
certainly help, and sometimes
they are the only way to get
what you want. But please don’t
try to learn to draw from them;
they are already flat and your
drawings will follow suit, unless
you have drawn from life and
have enough practice to be 
able to “see” and draw three-
dimensional shape and form. Try
to use the photos for detail only.
Experiment with differ-
ent materials and tex-
tures to see what works
best for the animal
you’re trying to convey.

Animals in Your Drawings
If you took our advice and went out in your yard, took that fishing trip, or made that day
trip to the zoo, you probably have a lot of animal drawings now. Some of them are sketches
and some of them might already include some surroundings, so you are partway there.
Putting them, or drawing them into, a landscape as an addition takes a bit more planning
and attention to scale.
Scale and Detail, Indoors or Out
Animals inside are usually easy to place because the scale is easy to judge. If you can already
draw the chair your dog or cat is sitting in, adding your pet will require only a clear draw-
ing of the animal, or what you can see of it, which can be the problem. Look carefully at
where limbs are tucked underneath and how the body might be curled up in a comfortable
position. Then draw what you see.
Like Odin, Lauren’s dog,
all animals have their
favorite chairs. Draw
them there for a realistic
likeness.
Detail and Scale, Close Up or Far Away
Outside is another story. Scale as it indicates size and distance is important to your consid-
eration of animals in the landscape. The most common example is a seascape, with seagulls
that are supposed to be flying above but instead seem to be looming out of proportion to
everything else in the drawing.
Practice in measuring against a base unit in your view will help keep those birds where they
belong.
If you are trying to emphasize an animal as the central point of interest, treat it like a por-
trait, with the landscape in the background.
In the next chapter, we’ll take the next logical step, and show you how you can have
human animals in your drawings, too.

The Least You Need to Know
➤Animals live in a world of action. Seeing and drawing that action and gesture is the
first step in getting the sense of the animal you are looking at.
➤Proportion and shape build on gesture, adding muscle shape to the direction and
placement of the main limbs.
➤The form of the animal should be considered. Even a bird’s leg is a three-
dimensional form.
➤Photographs can supply detail information, but are flattened versions of the real
thing and not as good for practice.
➤Quick sketches of an uncooperative pet or wild subject can gradually give you
enough information for a more finished portrait.

In This Chapter
➤Drawing the human figure
➤Gesture is all
➤A feel for body parts
➤Form and proportion
A drawing of the nude is the most revealing form of artistic expression simply because it is the
most immediate and the most personal.
—Mervyn Levy, The Artist and the Nude, (New York: Clarkson Potter, 1965).
We are fascinated and enticed by the figure, the most single expressive subject for artistic
exploration. When we draw the figure, are we drawing ourselves or all humanity? Perhaps it
doesn’t matter—the figure attracts us, whatever the reason.
Your sketchbook will be your greatest asset in learning to draw from the figure. Constant
sketching is the way to an understanding of the figure and an ability to quickly see and
draw a gesture. The more you draw, the more you will see. Your drawings will quickly gain
grace, proportion, and form. You will be able to use your own creativity, and your work will
be original and unique.
Drawing the Figure
Like the four-footed and winged animals you worked on in Chapter 20, “It’s a Jungle Out
There—So Draw It!,” people move around a lot. Get used to it. Work with the knowledge
that they will move and you won’t be disappointed.
Drawing people is virtually impossible without a working understanding of the nude figure.
Once you do learn it, you may find the shapes and beauty of the figure become your favor-
ite image.

Getting Some Practice and Help
Classes and informal drawing groups with a model are there for the looking.
Museums and adult education programs are places to check. You can always start a
group, with or without a formal instructor. A model can work with suggestions as
to the type and length of poses favored by the group. Working from the figure in
a comfortable studio setting can add to the intimacy of the poses and the detail
surrounding the model, too.
Use Your Sketchbook
A sketchbook is a visual storehouse, a place to practice, and a fascinating and
sometimes poignant record of life as well.
Capture the posture and gesture of your subject in a few moments. Try for a sense
of character if you can in some of the angles and shapes.
The Gesture of Life
Gesture drawings are a good place to start. The object is to cap-
ture the essence of the pose, which might be quite energetic
as it does not have to be held very long.
In the section following, we’ve provided guidelines for trying
a gesture drawing of your own.
Direction and Gesture
When sketching from a model, arrange yourself so that you
can see easily over your work and have a clear view of the
whole figure. You will need to look back and forth from
model to drawing often and quickly.
1. Allow about three to four minutes for each pose. You
can ask your model ahead of time to change the pose
according to a preestablished schedule.
2. Try to capture:
➤The line of the spine.
➤The twist or angle of the spine.
➤The angle of the head and neck.
➤The angles of the shoulders and hips (which are
often opposite to each other).
➤The directions of the arms and legs.
That will keep you plenty busy!
Artist’s Sketchbook
Gesture drawings are drawn
from short poses, no more than
four minutes and often as short
as one minute.
Try Your Hand
Try to mentally experience the
pose yourself, particularly the
more energetic ones. Feel 
the tension or off-centeredness,
the weight on one foot, or the
reach or twist as if it were you.

273
Chapter 21 ➤The Human Body and Its Extremities
Thoughts on Quick Action Poses
Instruct the model to change poses at intervals. With each new pose, begin a new drawing,
even if you have not finished. Create a little pressure for yourself. Like a workout, make
yourself stretch with the model. Don’t erase, just draw and draw. If you need to correct,
draw over it and keep going.
If it is possible for you, try to draw in a little indication of form, some roundness in the
limbs. Make the shapes where body parts overlap. Feel the parts of the body yourself as you
draw.
Try to work evenly around the figure as long as you can. Try not to focus on just one spot—
you can lose sight of what you are doing and whether there are still problems to correct.
Use yourself when you run out of models; a mirror or two will give you plenty to work
with.
Quick gesture drawings are great for discovering how the
human body works, and how it looks in motion. Making ges-
ture drawings will help you learn the proportional relationships
of body parts and to follow their natural movement.

Body Parts and the Whole: Anatomy, You Say?
Anatomy, after all, is under there. Why not have at least a passing acquaintance? Here’s the
quickest anatomy lesson ever written:
➤The skeletal structure of a figure determines the proportion.
➤Muscle groups and their relative development are the shapes of the body and limbs, but
the bones are still underneath.
➤Fat deposits (relax—we all have them) alter the shapes according to how much of it is
where.
➤Age is another factor in how the body looks. The skeleton loses some of its flexibility
with age, muscles change, how and where fat is retained is different, and the quality of
the skin changes. Yuccck!
It’s all a little clinical, but there it is. You’ll find that your drawings will be much better for
the time you spend understanding the skeleton and muscle arrangement.
The Hip Bone Is Connected to the … 
Now that you’ve got those basics, here’s more you should know about anatomy.
➤The skeleton has 206 bones, held together by ligaments. At the joints, the bones are
covered with a thin layer of cartilage to protect them against wear and tear. There is
connective tissue and fluid to lubricate the joints.
➤The body is supported by the spine, 33 vertebrae from the skull through the shoulders,
rib cage, and down to the pelvis.
➤The rib cage forms a barrel-like structure to hold and protect the heart and lungs.
➤The arms hang from the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder, and bend and rotate 
at the elbow joint and the wrist joint, which in turn allow the complex flexing of the
hand.
➤The pelvis, a basin-like arrangement at the end of the spine, supports and protects the
intestinal system.
➤Weight is transferred to the large bones of the legs at the ball-and-socket joint of the
hip, transferred down the leg at the knee joint, and ends in the base formed by the feet.
The Art of Drawing
There are lots of ways to work longer on a pose. Go for tone, shadow, likeness, detail, a shaded
work, a fine line. They are all worth trying. But the most important thing is a good seeing and
beginning drawing. Why spend a half hour or more rendering a drawing that has an inaccurate
base?

275
Chapter 21 ➤The Human Body and Its Extremities
Muscle Is Good
Muscles do the work of moving the skeleton, from large sweeping motions like running to
small subtle movements like smiling or breathing. There are over 600 muscles in the body,
doing a variety of functions. Attached with ligaments to bones at either end, they can con-
tract and become shorter and thicker, or they can stretch and become longer and thinner.
For drawing purposes, we are concerned with the large ones that shape the torso and limbs,
and the complex muscles of the face that create expression, a kinesic function.
The torso is all the bone and muscles forming the middle of the body, from the shoulders
to the pelvis. Flexing and stretching is possible because of the flexibility of the spine,
which, as the middle-aged among us know, varies tremendously from person to person. The
combinations of twists and turns are amazing, really. The spine even has a double curve
when in a standing position.
The front of the torso is a sheet of muscles, including abdominals, which bend the body
forward, and sacrospinals, the back muscles, which bend it backward. The chest muscles—
pectorals—form the bulk of the chest, and breasts are glandular, with a covering of fat.
The wide range of motion in the arms is a function of the ball-
and-socket joint of the shoulder and the clavicle (collarbone) and
scapula (shoulder bone), which are not tightly attached and move
to allow stretches and reaches.
Muscles in the shoulder section are the pectorals, the chest, the
trapezius, the shoulders, and the latissimus dorsi on the back. The
shoulder muscle is the deltoid. Arm muscles go from the shoulder
to the elbow (biceps on the front and triceps on the back), and
another set go to the wrist.
Legs are shaped by large muscles that support the weight of the
body and move it about. Gluteus maximus, the large muscles of
the buttocks, go over the pelvis to the legs. Thigh muscles (biceps
and rectus femoris) go from the hip to the knee and the calf (gas-
tronemus) and shin muscles go from the knee to the ankle.

Some Basic Proportions
The Greek physician Hippocrates (460–377 B.C.E.) recognized two body
types:
➤Phthisic habitus—tall, thin physique
➤Apoplectic habitus—short, thick physique
But these two body types really don’t even begin to cover the variations
in the human body, and the study of physical anthropology has identi-
fied a wide range of body types. William Sheldon, an anthropologist in
the 1930s, devised a system based on three main types:
➤Endomorphic—fat
➤Mesomorphic—muscular
➤Ectomorphic—bony
Back to the Drawing Board
Note that these are body types,
and are not the same as height.
These types occur in all possible
variations, degrees, or amounts.

277
Chapter 21 ➤The Human Body and Its Extremities
Try drawing the action and position of the figure with the simplest of lines for the spine,
shoulder, hip, and limbs. Add some volume to the body cavity, the shoulders, and the
pelvic area. You can practice a kind of stick figure, or you can draw the body as a series of
proportional ellipses, or you can see it as a group of cylinders and boxes. However you
begin, close seeing and drawing of the muscles should follow. The best practice is … well,
practice.
An awareness of body types helps to see the proportions
of an individual, for better or worse.
Ellipsoids, as opposed to humanoids, and cylinder/box figures are a great way to start adding volume to a
gesture.

Age and Gender: Some Basic Differences, As If You
Didn’t Know
Body proportion is important to understand. It changes radically from birth to adulthood
and is slightly different between males and females as well.
Body, Age, and Proportion
Did you know that the body can be measured relatively at any age, in heads? That’s right:
an average adult’s height is eight heads, easily divisible in heads at the chin, nipples, navel,
crotch, mid-thigh, knee, and then calf/foot.
Children’s heads are much larger relatively. A baby’s head is about one-quarter of its body,
as are its legs. As a child grows, so do its legs, while the head size decreases relative to the
body and the limbs.
Accurately seeing and
measuring the propor-
tions of a figure from
childhood to puberty to
adulthood is crucial for
getting the look of the
particular age group.

If you don’t have the opportunity to sketch live nudes, try copying famous male nude
sculptures, such as Michelangelo’s David.
1. Start with a gesture
sketch to capture the
pose of a female nude.
2. Once you’ve got the
pose, begin to refine
forms and shapes.
3. Use negative space to
further define the pose
and enhance a three-
dimensional effect.

Where’s the Beef? Where the Ice Cream Goes
Fat deposits are shapes to contend with when drawing the figure.
Muscle development varies from person to person of either gender, but male musculature is
generally heavier than the female. Fat distribution is different, too. Men carry weight at the
middle, on the upper back, and lower back. Women tend to carry weight on their buttocks,
abdomen, thighs, breasts, and the backs of the upper arms. While today’s culture doesn’t al-
ways consider this attractive, it’s a natural part of human anatomy. So relax and open that
carton of Mocha Almond Fudge.
Typical areas of fat de-
posits on the human
body.
What We Have to Look Forward To
As the body ages, the flexor muscles shorten and tend to pull the body into a stoop. In ad-
dition, the spine curves more, the shoulders round or stoop, and the neck thrusts the head
forward. At the same time, muscle tone changes, and the muscles become thinner and
shrink. Joints, meanwhile, seem larger relatively. Skin and soft tissue gets softer and saggy at
the stomach, breasts, elbows, and chin. More ice cream, anyone?
Children, with their longer more flexible muscles, are, not surprisingly, more like animals,
always in motion.

Extremities: Getting Over Hand and Feet Phobias
The most commonly drawn figure pose is a lovely torso, with the hands behind the back and
the head and feet somehow left off, as with the Venus de Milo. There is a reason for this.
Hands
Hands are the bane of many a figure drawing. There are dozens of small bones and muscles
and ligaments in the hand and the wrist which allow us the wonderful range of movement
we take for granted, even down to the typing of the manuscript for this book.
Think of the hand as a flat, rather squarish shape, with a wrist joint at one end (it is amazing
how often the wrist is ignored), and a curved edge at the other end from which four fingers
extend. This plane is flexible and can rotate and bend at the wrist. On one side, there is a
wedge-shaped muscle from which comes the thumb. The placement of the thumb in this
flexible wedge is what allows us the wonder of “the opposing thumb,” the use of thumb and
fingers in coordinated effort. Think of doing anything without this gift!
Practice, with your own hand as your cheap model, is the best way to draw the hand. Make
that model work for its lunch. Practice, in fact, is the only way you will learn to draw the
hand. There’s no getting around it.
Children are more like animals, in perpetual motion, so you’ll want to use gesture drawing when captur-
ing them. The tilt of a knee can express so much! Practice as well the folds of a dress or getting that
ponytail to have just the right swing.
Here are some hand po-
sitions to practice copy-
ing. Use arcs to get the
relationship of wrist and
finger joints. (see next

Feet
Feet are similarly avoided in figure drawings. But because they are the base for the body at
rest or in action, you need to pay closer attention to them.
Think of the feet as wedged-shaped bases, higher where they are connected at the ankle
joint, sloping down toward the front edge, with an arched shape underneath, and ending
in five toes for added stability. Here, too, practice will best acquaint you with the shapes
and positions. And you have two of these fine specimens to work with, as you probably are
not holding a pencil with one of them.
The base of all figure
drawings: the feet.
Practice copying these
foot positions. Visit the
sculpture gallery of your
local museum with your
sketchbook in hand and
start sketching the feet of
the statues. Try sketching
the feet of one statue
from different eye levels
or views to see how the
foot changes as you
change your orientation.

Chapter 21 ➤The Human Body and Its Extremities
Head and Neck
The head and neck top off a striking structure. The cervical vertebrae go up into the skull
and allow the head its range of turning, twisting, and bending. If you’ve ever had a bad stiff
neck, you know how precious this flexibility is.
The head itself is roughly as wide as it is high in profile from the front, although it is thin-
ner than it is high and has an oval shape. In the back, the skull is rounded, behind the
shape of the face and jaw. The back of the neck goes up into the skull, while the front of
the neck goes up under the chin and jaw. The main plane of the face is modified by the 
facial features: the wedge shape of the nose, the forehead, the eye sockets, the cheekbones,
the mouth and jaw, and the ears on the sides.
Along with studying a few examples here—or better yet, in the hundreds of master draw-
ings in books or museums—just get in there and try some head studies. They’ll help with
portraiture to come.
Take a look at these head studies to see how to top off your figure drawing.
More Form and Weight, Now
Okay, ready to try a figure drawing of your own?
1. Start your drawing with a few gesture or action lines that are the main limbs and 
direction of movement. Then, think of the body as a collection of spare parts, drawn
as geometric shapes of various sizes and on various angles relative to each other.
2. Use quick lines to establish gesture, proportion, and shape.
3. Use ellipses for form, particularly ellipsoids.
In longer efforts, the same is true; just continue to add detail, check proportion, and
then add more detail and form.
4. Look at the shapes and the way a shape goes over or under another, especially at the
joints. Think of the roundedness of the body, its strength, and its flexibility as you
draw volume and weight into the gesture.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
284
5. Try to add tone that rounds the shapes and adds a sense of the smoothness, hardness,
flabbiness, flatness, or thinness that you see on the model.
A figure drawing is as simple as the sum
of its parts.
In Chapter 22, “Dress ’Em Up and Move ’Em Out,” we will approach the head, its propor-
tions and parts, the always popular portrait, a consideration of clothing, and the business of
populating your drawings with your friends, family, or perfect (or close to perfect) strangers.

The Least You Need to Know
➤The human figure is perhaps the most compelling and challenging of subjects to
draw.
➤Gesture and proportion are your first priorities to capture the action and movement
of a living being.
➤A working knowledge of anatomy, the skeleton, and muscle groups will help
tremendously when you visualize and feel your way into a pose.
➤As you work toward a more finished figure study, gender, fitness, weight, and age all
contribute to the look of the figure.

I’m trying to capture something of the world I inhabit, but it’s really about my own journey.
—Ed Hall, portraitist on the Long Island Railroad
Because most landscapes seem to have as many people milling around as the houses they
live in, it’s time to get out there and start drawing these folks. Draw your family, your
friends, or that elusive perfect stranger. You know, the tall, dark one? Oh, wait—that’s a dif-
ferent book.
In this chapter, we’ll show you how to dress up your figures—not just in clothes, but by 
individualizing their features, bodies, and gestures. 
Add That Human Touch
Your landscape drawings will often be enhanced and enlivened by the addition of people,
whether singly or in groups. That’s because a human presence adds a sense of place, of scale,
and of timeliness—as well as a touch of, well, humanity.
When it comes to that human touch, think of your sketchbook as a personal statement of
your reaction to life, as well as a place to practice, to record, and to react—rather like a
diary, but also as a storehouse of images and ideas for future use.
You can begin by using your sketchbook at home, when the family is watching TV, playing
out in the yard (especially if there’s a chore you’d rather ignore), or while someone is at the
barbecue or asleep in a hammock.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
288
At other times, too, make use of your sketchbook as often as you can. Draw peo-
ple in the street, on the train, waiting for the bus, at lunch in the park, walking a
dog, jogging, sunning on the grass—anywhere you can think of will do.
People are a natural part
of any landscape.
A good way to capture a
figure spontaneously is
to do a Plexiglas sketch,
such as these two exam-
ples.
No Flat Heads Here: Heads and Faces
So, you’ve asked a friend or family member to pose for a portrait. Now, let’s make sure that
you end up with a three-dimensional, proportionally correct face and head, with the eyes,
nose, and mouth where they’re supposed to be, so you don’t lose a friend—or end up in 
divorce court.
Types and Proportion
Let’s start at the top. The head is an oval from the front, rather thinner than it is high. In
profile, the head is about as wide as it is high. The back of the skull is rounded and the jaw
line curves down to the chin.

289
Chapter 22 ➤Dress ’Em Up and Move ’Em Out
As with body types, heads and facial structures come in anthropologically identifiable gra-
dations (what a mouthful—say that 10 times fast):
➤A dolichocephalic face is long and narrow and has a distinctive convex profile.
➤A brachycephalic face is flatter and wider.
➤A mesocephalic face is squarer and has traits of both.
Try to see past generalities as you draw the beginning shapes of a
person’s head and face, just as you would with their body type.
Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat
The head, face, and the position of the facial features can be
roughly described with a few quick lines. Then you can draw some
additional lines lightly to establish a guide.
On the oval of the front of the head
➤The eyes are at about halfway.
➤The nose is about halfway between the eyes.
➤The chin curves at the bottom of the oval.
➤The mouth line is about halfway between the nose and the
chin.
Try Your Hand
When you are going out, remem-
ber to take your sketchbook 
with you and draw people as you
find them—at picnics, concerts,
sporting events, speeches, in
restaurants, on boats, in planes …
whatever.
These drawn guidelines,
along with the written
rules above, will help
you position the features
on just about any face.
In addition:
➤The eyes are about one eye’s width apart along the middle line.
➤The nose is a wedge shape in the middle of the face.
➤When the face is seen in profile, the nose is a triangle out from the face.
➤At any view, the wedge of the nose is perpendicular to the face.
➤The mouth is formed by the two lips, centered under the nose.
➤The chin is the narrow curve of the bottom jaw, a line that comes from just below the
ear.
➤The ears themselves are flaps that are on the side of the head at about a level between
the eyes and the nose.
➤The neckline comes from the ear on the side and under the chin.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
290
Especially for Children
Remember that a child’s head and face have their own proportion relative to an adult face
and head. Look carefully at the differences:
➤The eyes are wider and larger.
➤The nose is shorter, softer (all cartilage and bone develops later), and more upturned.
➤The mouth is usually fuller.
➤The forehead is wider.
➤The chin is smaller.
Likeness and Portraiture
Portraiture attracts most people. After all, we do like to look at our fellow humans and fam-
ily members. But where do you begin? At the top. The following rules of drawing the face
can help you.
1. Begin a portrait with a study of the head and facial proportions of your subject.
2. Check the angles very carefully, including the angle of the pose, whether from side 
to side or tilted up or down, or both. Position the guidelines for the features so they
line up.
The guidelines for the
full frontal view, accom-
panied by the finished
portrait.
The guidelines for a three-quarter view, accompanied by the initial sketch and more finished
drawing where tone and detail are beginning to be added.

291
Chapter 22 ➤Dress ’Em Up and Move ’Em Out
3. There is no point in rendering a nose that is just a little bit too high or a mouth that
is just a little bit off to the side, so make sure of your base. Draw lightly until you like
the shapes.
Examples of an infant’s
face. 
Some Basic Proportions and Shapes
Look for the specific shapes that make up the features of your subject. For example:
➤Faces are round, wide, narrow, oval, or square.
➤Noses come in lots of shapes and sizes.
➤Eyes are close, wide, deep, small or large, squinty or round.
➤Eyebrows and the bridge of the nose are key transitions.
➤Cheekbones are high or low, prominent or flat.
➤Mouths are wide or narrow, full-lipped or thin.
➤Jaws are wide or narrow, under- or overdeveloped.
➤Ears are small or large, close or protruding.
➤Necks are long or short, thin or thick.
➤Hairline, type of hair, and cut of hair all identify an individual.
The Art of Drawing
A recent issue of Newsday had an article about Ed Hall, a veteran commuter on the Long Island
Railroad, who has sketched his fellow commuters on the train for the last 11 years.
“I love my species,” he said of his fascination with the sleeping faces that are his subjects.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
292
Our features are mostly all in the same place, so it’s the little variations that make the indi-
vidual and the expression.
Begin work on the features on your portrait with the same concern for shape, space, and
form that you have used on all your work. Consider the basic shapes and then refine them
as you go. The more you look at the shape and structure of a feature, the better you will
draw it.
Setting a Scene for a Portrait
Setting a scene for a portrait is a nice way to add to the special feeling and the connection
to the subject’s life or interests. Some portraits are set in intimate surroundings to create a
secret spot or a restful feel; others are set in a more public space, or outdoors if it suits the
subject. You are the ultimate judge of what’s appropriate when it comes to setting, but
don’t hesitate to try a setting that is unusual.
You might want to practice drawing just
features to get a feel for their individual-
ity. The nose knows ….

293
Chapter 22 ➤Dress ’Em Up and Move ’Em Out
When You Are Your Subject
When you’re your subject, you have even more say in how the drawing will look. One or
more mirrors can set you up with any number of views, and you can sit for yourself as long
as you like. There will also, hopefully, be less argument about when to take breaks and how
long you’re making your subject sit still.

Folds, Drapes, Buttons, and Bows
You might want to go back to the description of drawing fabric in Chapter 14 to review
some of the tricks of fabric drawing. Once you’ve got fabric mastered, clothes will fall right
into place. But here are some further hints, too.
Over and Under: Folds and How to Draw
Them
Quite simply, clothing covers the body that you are drawing. Once
you’ve gotten a basic sketch and are happy with the proportions and
gesture, you’ll want to begin to add the detail of the clothing. Remem-
ber that clothing covers a rounded figure, not a flat one. Places like
necklines, cuffs, and pant legs need to have a roundness to them.
Detailing: Make the Clothing Fit the
Woman or Man
The detail in clothing adds to the pose and gesture of an individual
and sets the scene for that person’s activity in your drawing. You can
sketch it in or you can spend time on the textures and patterns, the
style, and the details.
Self-portraits drawn on
Plexiglas produce a
quick-study image.
Details of self-portraits,
such as a vivid facial ex-
pression or that favorite
pet, add poignancy and
endearing emotion to
self-portraits.
Back to the Drawing Board
Often, clothing needs to be seen
as form—imagine where, and
how, the lines and folds go when
you can’t see them under, over,
or behind the body of your sub-
ject. Creases where one shape
goes behind another need to be
imagined and drawn.

295
Chapter 22 ➤Dress ’Em Up and Move ’Em Out
In addition, a few props can often add the detail you’re after in a portrait. If you enjoy
drawing people, as portraits or as characters in your larger work, you might amass a collec-
tion of prop hats, gloves, boots, jewels, flowers, and feathers, just for fun.
Putting People in Your Drawings
If you’re out drawing a landscape and there are people in it, you should feel confident
enough to add them now. You do, however, need to place them well and keep them in scale
with their surroundings.
Generally, careful measuring and relational seeing will get them in the right place. Feel free
to return to the tear card at the front of this book whenever you need a reminder about
measuring guidelines.
Where Are They?
Inside, the scale of people and things is not much of a problem, because the distances are
not great and the people are probably easy to see. Try drawing a friend working in the
kitchen, or a family member snoozing in front of the TV, or an intimate friend in the tub or
relaxing in the bedroom. The setting of your drawing helps place the person and adds a
special feeling about the moment.

Part 6 ➤Drawing Animals and People
296
Outside, however, is a different story; the possibilities are about as endless as the landscape
itself. Your figures can be off in the distance and be just another element in the landscape,
like a tree or fence. Or, they can be rather in the middle and be part of the action of the
drawing, or in the foreground and be the action, with the landscape providing the back-
drop and setting for their activity. People in the foreground, particularly if they are interest-
ingly dressed, deserve some real attention to detail.
What Are They Doing? Action, Gesture, and Detail
The body in action probably presents you with some foreshortening challenges. It’s really
quite simple, though: If you think of people as cylinders in space, you’ll know how to draw
them. Measure carefully to see where the body parts line up with each other in the fore-
shortened pose, as opposed to the figure if it were standing straight up.
To draw people at work and at play, concentrate on the action and the gesture in quick
lines, adding detail as you can. Sometimes a small detail, like a hat or a fishing pole, is
enough to begin to convey a feel for the person or the activity.
No matter what, you’ll find that adding people to your drawings adds a whole new dimen-
sion. Try it and see. In the next chapter, we’ll explore drawing for a special class of people—
kids.
The Art of Drawing
Seeing and measuring the scale of your figures in the landscape relative to other elements will
put them where you want them. The detail in your figures will vary according to their place-
ment and importance in your landscape. Those guys off in the distance need to really be there,
but you won’t see the logos on their T-shirts.
Placing people in your landscape can add both drama and character(s).

The Least You Need to Know
➤The head and face are a challenge, but if you see the proportion and detail, you will
be able to draw what you see and capture the uniqueness of your subject.
➤Adding clothing doesn’t have to be complicated; think of it as fabric draped on a
body.
➤Putting people in your interiors or landscapes adds scale and interest as well as a
sense of place, time, and individuality.
➤Remember that clothing goes over a breathing, bending body, and look for the
drapes, creases, and folds that make clothing real.

➤Exercises to get kids drawing
The study of composition means an art education for the entire people, for every child can be
taught to compose—what it is to know and feel beauty and to produce it in simple ways.
—Arthur Wesley Dow
From earliest man’s drawings on cave walls, to the great Renaissance drawings of da Vinci and
onwards, to the works of our contemporaries, drawing is a basic human expression. With
today’s power-based, language-driven, analytical attitude toward education, though, drawing
no longer has a place of real importance (generally speaking).
Children are taught the importance of academic achievement, but visual skills are usually
thought of as pastimes or hobbies. This means that children draw until they are educated out
of their innocent sense of wonder and the ability to just “do” without being caught up in
“correctness” and passing judgment on their work. They then abandon drawing altogether.
You, however, can change this: Use what you have learned about drawing and try being a
child’s guide. Get in touch with your child, grandchild, or a young friend and open up to the
world of seeing and drawing, together.
From Symbols to Realism
Young children are confronted with a world of things to see, learn, name, and understand, to
say nothing of concepts, ideas, and feelings. They start by drawing stick figures to communi-
cate ideas to themselves and others, and as they draw these “crude” pictures, they are con-
necting words to their mind pictures. As you’ll recall from Chapter 1, “The Pleasures of Seeing
and Drawing,” drawing itself is nonverbal, but it helps children develop ideas and language.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life
302
Young children continue to draw their ideas in symbols while at the same time they learn
to see and draw objects as well. And, as their visual perception skills develop, they also
learn to concentrate, become more patient, and increase their problem-solving ability.
Older children have already given up symbolic drawing and want to draw realistically, and
they are frustrated if they can’t. By the time a child is in second grade, in fact, the left-brain
world of editorial judgment is firmly in place, and that joy of uncensored creativity is gone.
Stick figures aren’t just for kids. These were drawn by some of Lauren’s friends.
Educating the Right Side
We teach the “do as I say” method of imparting knowledge, and then we test to establish
capability, skill, and intelligence in just that one way, never acknowledging that there are
many kinds of intelligence and many ways of working. The truth is that education is learn-
ing, but it’s a left-brained, verbally based, language-driven attitude toward learning.
To teach art and drawing to children—or to learn along with them—helps them learn early
on to access the relational right and avoid the crunch when they are frustrated that makes
them quit. Using a right-brained approach, children can learn visual (and life) skills to last
them into adulthood:
➤Spatial organization
➤Attention to detail
➤Patience
➤Kindness

303
Chapter 23 ➤Just for Children
In addition, drawing has an advantage as a learning activity. Because it is seen as a pleasura-
ble activity rather than an academic one, it’s not thought of as stressful. At the same time,
because it’s often an ungraded subject, or at least not viewed as stringently as more academ-
ic ones, it’s relatively free of the anxiety and fear of failure that come with other subjects.
From Hunter to High Tech
Long, long ago, we were more connected—to the land, to our fam-
ilies, to the way we gathered and grew food, to the animals that
provided food, clothing, and shelter, and to the expression of our-
selves through drawing. In short, the hunter-gatherer’s way of life
relied on basic skills, interdependence, and cooperation.
As we settled into the lives of farmers and craftspeople, these basic
skills were still important. At the same time, the added activities 
of exploration and the settling of new lands required “multi-
tasking,” but also included a growing dependence on domination
and superiority.
Today, the hard work and basic life skills required of the agrarian
age have been supplanted by the academic learning and analytical
knowledge valued in this industrial and post-industrial age. And,
when we look forward into the technological age of the twenty-
first century, it’s clear that all kinds of creative, visionary skills will
be necessary for full development.
Visual Learning for All Reasons
Visual learning is a great tool: If you draw something you know it, and to know it, you draw
it. As Frederick Frank puts it, “I have learned that what I have not drawn, I have never really
seen …. ” Children across the learning spectrum can benefit from learning to draw in a vari-
ety of ways:
➤Drawing can help where skills have been or are compromised because of various chal-
lenges. Those with only average academic skills, for example, can have well above-
average skills in visual areas, and even enjoy careers as visual artists, artisans, and
craftsmen. Research has shown that learning disabilities are often problems in the 
processing of language-based information, and learning-disabled people often have
very strong visual skills.
➤Whatever a child’s skills, new levels of competence and a sense of reward can be at-
tained with effort and patience. Then, with the confidence gained from the new learn-
ing and activities, potential career options increase as well. Children who draw no
longer view their sense of self as narrow or traditional.
➤Drawing promotes new energy and confidence in any endeavor, adding important rea-
soning skills to the battery of left-brain thinking. Drawing a difficult subject can speed
the rate of learning the information—and extend the retention time, too.
➤In the electronic arena, the creative relational mind is a plus; the ability to see the big
picture and look at it from another angle and continue to see it anew is a gift.
Human expression has a value all its own. To be able to express feeling and thoughts visu-
ally is to encourage one to feel and express those feelings—and a step along the way to
greater understanding amongst us all.

We All Love to Draw
In a nonthreatening environment, we all love to draw. That’s because the hidden child
comes out to play. But traditional instruction in drawing was for older children, usually
those who drew well, and was focused on traditional European styles and models. It didn’t
leave much room for fun.
Today, those of us who help children draw know that they can learn to draw realistically 
in a creative environment without sacrificing their natural creativity. With older children
particularly, the experience can keep them from hitting the wall of frustration when they
can’t draw to their expectations and quit. The key is that nonthreatening environment—
and permission to play.
Drawing can be fun—just look at these, with the theme: Springtime and Easter.

305
Chapter 23 ➤Just for Children
Kids Draw at Any Age
Children need help with drawing realistically before they stop, as they naturally will, the
symbolic stick-type drawings they made when younger to describe their world. And teen-
agers will resist because their language-based left brains have taken over and told them they
can’t draw.
When you’re drawing with a group of children, you’ll need to be aware of these differences.
If there is a range of skill and age in a group, go for the average. The slower ones will catch
up and the more advanced will experiment.
The Very Young
Start drawing with kids when they’re young; you can give the gift of visual experience to a
very young child and likely affect the child’s visual abilities, encouraging his or her ability
to be visually inclined and gifted. One possible activity is to play games with basic shapes.
Recognition and duplication of those circles, squares, and triangles is good for visual per-
ception and for developing the motor skills and coordination needed for drawing.
The Art of Drawing
By determining the child’s particular interests, you can help encourage a child to draw. Many
children, for example, love nature and draw wonderful botanical or biological studies. Others
love and draw detailed maps, learning the geography as they go. Mechanically minded children
might draw parts of things to show how something works—even if that something is a made-up
spaceship or rocket. Whatever interests them, they are learning about drawing and learning to
follow their interests, a great gift.
Stages from Symbol to Image
Time spent with a child is the best way to know just where he or she falls in the stages of
visual development, and, as with all other development, a child may advance beyond and
retreat back. The following guidelines will help you determine where best to apply your 
energies:
➤At ages three to four years, you can work with basic shapes, but children in this age
group will mostly draw symbolically in stick figures.
➤By the time children are five to six years old, they can begin to draw realistically from
simple shapes, but they will also continue to draw symbolically.
➤Children who are seven to eight years old can draw realistically, but they may revert
to symbolic drawings for fun. Let them!
➤Adolescents from eight to thirteen years old have abandoned symbolic drawing and
are eager to draw realistically. They compare and criticize and can easily become 

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life
306
frustrated and give up if they feel they cannot perform. It’s especially important to re-
mind this age group that drawing is fun, not competitive.
Children’s drawings can reveal their interests and should be encouraged.

307
Chapter 23 ➤Just for Children
Tactics
There are a number of steps you can take to make drawing a positive experience for chil-
dren.
1. Set up a friendly and supportive world.
2. Talk as an adult, kindly and supportively, but not condescendingly. Kids treated thusly
will act more maturely.
3. Talk nonjudgmentally. Avoid performance words, competition or comparison words,
and definitely fear or failure words. Eliminate good, bad, better, best, right, wrong, easy,
hard, mistake, and cheat from your vocabulary.
4. Follow their lead on subjects to draw, at least some of the time, or try making a deal to
follow a suggestion for part of the time and work on a chosen project for the rest of
the time.
The Art of Drawing
Children have the imagination that most of us have lost, thanks to education and the demands
of adult life. Encourage a child to use stories as the impetus for their drawing, or let a child de-
velop a story to go with a picture or a picture to go with a story. Your child’s imagination may
get a boost in the bargain. Use your computer, or take a lesson from your young friend—kids
know more—and combine a story with a picture, illustrate a poem, or start a book project.
Materials for Kids
The next step in encouraging kids to draw is to stock up on 
whatever you don’t already have:
➤Markers, fine and broad-tipped, in lots of colors
➤Dry-erase markers for drawing on plastic
➤Mechanical pencils, with a thicker lead 
(0.7) in a few hardnesses
➤Colored pencils, as big a set of colors as possible
➤Erasers, an assortment; tape, scissors, clips
➤Paper—inexpensive, and lots of it
➤Boards, plywood to work on
➤Water-based paint, watercolor or acrylic, depending 
on the child’s age
➤India ink and pen or brush; water-soluble crayons

especially very young ones—in
the use of art materials. Keep

away from children who are too
young or who are not mature
enough to handle them.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life

Reference Materials
Accumulate a file of pictures to reference and ideas for pictures or backgrounds. Your young
friends can add to the pile, too. They will come up with uses and applications for pieces of
graphics that will amaze you. Pictures, postcards, cards, graphics, books and magazines, and
wrapping paper are a beginning. Soon, the kids will be bringing in materials you hadn’t
even thought of.
And then there is the world of objects. Try to set aside a shelf for things to draw. The sky is
the limit here. Be playful and inventive, surprising even. Flowers and fruit (dried or fresh or
fake), shells, skulls, bones, butterflies, plastic animals with good scale and detail, toy cars,
old toys, old blocks and log cabin sets, kitchen utensils and bowls, dollhouse furniture,
dolls, broken toys, fishing tackle, sports equipment, action figures, musical instruments, a
typewriter (if you still have one), roller skates, and tools—all these merely begin a list that
has no end.
Drawing objects are limited by only the imagination, as one of Lauren’s stu-
dents illustrates in these two drawings.
Retraining the Critic
Restrain and retrain the critic in your head (yup—it’s Old Lefty again).
Get rid of him and invite in your kinder right side as a guide instead.
We don’t need nasty critics; there is no right or wrong, and no one
way.
See the Basics
Getting back to basics is the best approach for drawing with kids.
Create a peaceful and encouraging environment, with no judgmental
words like mistake, no competitive words like good, bad, better, or best.
With younger children, see the basic shapes—the circles, triangles, and
squares in anything—and draw them as the beginning. With older
children, try to see the three-dimensional geometric shapes in things—
spheres, cubes, funnels, eggs, and tubes—and use them as building
blocks toward more complicated things.
Back to the Drawing Board
You don’t need to feel guilty
about getting help or using help.
And don’t worry about copying—
actually, you can learn a lot by
copying, and your art will still be
different because you are different.
Just don’t try to pass off that great
Rembrandt knock-off as your own.

309
Chapter 23 ➤Just for Children
Banish that critic—it’s just Old Lefty, rearing his ugly head.
Eventually, the process of seeing and
drawing becomes second nature.
Pick Simple Terms to Explain Things
Children might not understand all the terms that we assume they understand, so it’s im-
portant to use simple language until you are sure of your explanations. For example,
➤A line or shape that is
➤horizontal is lying down.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life
310
➤vertical is standing up.
➤diagonal is leaning.
➤receding or diminishing is getting smaller in the distance.
➤A profile is the side of something or someone’s face.
➤A contour line goes all around the edge of something.
You can probably think of more simple ways to describe things, ideas, or projects.
When Problems Arise
As with all activities, you’ll have good days and not-so-good days. Remain supportive and
understanding if things don’t go as you planned, and look for reasons for the speed bump
that you might have overlooked. Maintaining a protective and encouraging atmosphere
that includes mutual trust will enable the child to work out a problem.
In spite of your best intentions, though, problems will arise. So here are
some of the possible pitfalls and solutions.
Distractions and Quiet
A proactive approach can be best when it comes to peace and quiet dur-
ing drawing time. Drawing is best done in silence, because the right
brain is not chatty. Try for a quiet, peaceful time, and maybe some soft
music. Explain that drawing time is not story time, and that it feels
good to sit quietly and draw and tell the stories later.
Tension, Frustration, Fatigue, and Short
Attention Span
Whole books are written on each of these, because children are apt to
experience any or all of them while drawing. Be as patient as you can.
Look for the reason behind the problem, encourage the child to explain
his or her feelings, and remain the kind adult.
The older a child is, the longer his or her attention span will be. If any
of the above is exhibited at the beginning of the drawing session, it’s
possible that drawing isn’t the problem at all.
As a child learns to enjoy drawing, they’ll want to do it more often and
for longer periods of time. The most important rule for length of session
and how often they should occur is flexibility—yours. Don’t impose
left-brained, adult rigidity on what should be a joyful, fun-filled activity.
Fun Drawing Exercises for Kids
Be as inventive as you can as you look back through the exercises in
this book and adapt them for your young friends and family. We’ve
done some of that for you, but don’t let us stop you from coming up
with some variations of your own as well.
➤For the very young: Recognize and copy. Young children enjoy
copying sets of shapes or lines. It’s good practice for observing
the differences and good for coordination, too.
Try Your Hand
Try thinking of lines and shapes
as animated, with personalities.
Be funny about it. Name them
with the child. Draw them as
characters to reinforce their
identity, then try the same tactic
with basic shapes, and even
three-dimensional ones. You may
get some very amusing results.
Back to the Drawing Board
Avoid generalities or “art speak”
with kids (or adults, for that
matter). Save it for cocktail par-
ties instead. When you’re work-
ing with kids, explain specifically
what you mean and where.

311
Chapter 23 ➤Just for Children
➤After a while, try drawing with basic shapes. Give the circle, oval, triangle, wedge, square,
and rectangle a try. You can set up building blocks and then Lincoln logs in simple
groups to serve as models.
➤For the older child, to help build a vocabulary of lines and textures, use a variety of simple
lines. Practice dots, straight lines, curves, jagged lines, spikes, spirals, and crisscrossed
lines for different shapes, tones, and textures.
➤Mirror-image vase exercise. Kids like the mirror-image vase/profile drawing from Chapter
2, “Toward Seeing for Drawing.” Let them invent a simple profile for the vase.
➤Drawing without looking. Review this exercise in Chapter 2, too, and try drawing a hand
or a thing without looking.
➤Negative-space drawings. Set up a simple chair, as in Chapter 6, “Negative Space as a
Positive Tool,” and try the negative-space drawing.
➤Upside-down drawing. Try the upside-down drawing from Chapter 2, but pick a simpler
subject to start, maybe a picture of an animal.
➤Drawing things that overlap. Spatial relationships may take some time for a child to
grasp. Try making a still life arrangement on a large piece of paper and draw a line
around each object to show the space it needs.
➤Portraits and self-portraits. Kids like to draw one another and themselves. Show them
the simple proportional lines to arrange the features on a face. Then, hand them a
mirror and see what happens.
Kids love to draw themselves—just look at these examples.
➤On the sliding glass door. Drawing on a sliding glass door with dry-erase markers is a 
favorite with Lauren’s classes. Take turns posing on the other side of the door, make
still life arrangements on a stool, or draw chairs, boots, baskets, and boxes—maybe

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life

even a bicycle—on the glass. Remember to close one eye to flatten the three-
dimensional space and stay very still as you are working.
Here are some drawings
kids drew on sliding
glass doors. (Be careful
when doing this exercise
to protect kids from acci-
dents; maintain good
supervision at all times
and make sure glass
panes are marked with
masking tape so kids
won’t mistakingly walk
into them.
A Place for Everything: How to Start
Find a place to start, a basic shape, the center of something, the stem of something. Then,
use the plastic picture plane or the viewfinder frame to help the child establish the center of
the page and the center of the image.
For “Mistakes” or “Problems”
As much as you try to avoid even the language of mistakes, children, particularly older ones,
will decide that something is wrong with their drawing. To encourage a creative solution,
you can always
➤Add something to the problem area, like texture.
➤Change something that is a problem into something else.
➤Transform something by looking at it differently.
➤Rearrange something on a new piece of paper (use a window or a lightbox, for exam-
ple).
Above All, Have Fun
Make the most of the time you have with a child. You will both benefit from the time to-
gether. The gift of seeing and drawing is one that a child will have and remember forever.

The Least You Need to Know
➤Children draw naturally, as we all did when life was simpler.
➤Young children use symbolic stick figure drawings to explore, understand, respond to,
and communicate about the world as they see it.
➤A child can learn to draw realistically as he or she develops naturally and gradually
abandons symbolic drawing.
➤Older children need help to see and draw up to their expectations so that they
don’t become frustrated and give up.
➤A protective, encouraging environment helps any child to feel comfortable and to
be able to experiment. It’s not bad for adults, either.

Your drawing subjects are limited only by your imagination. Travel, both overseas and to
the local nature preserve, for example, can be enhanced by carrying a sketchbook along
with your camera.
Then, there’s decorating your world. Once you’ve learned to draw, you can create books of
your own, or customize your home and your furniture.
This chapter is chock-full of suggestions for drawing, both on paper, and on some other sur-
faces you may not have thought of.
Have Sketchbook, Will Travel
We love to travel, and we love to see and draw whatever of interest comes along while we
do. We don’t really care where we are—Italian hill towns, ski villages in France, a nice tent
site in the Rockies, a beat-up hotel off the coast of Maine, the western desert. With the
changing landscape, up-close botanical details, still lifes there for the drawing, or vistas off
in the distance, there is always a visual treat.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life

Using Your Own Images
Using your own drawings for other projects is when the real fun be-
gins. Of course, drawing is for its own sake and should continue to be,
but now you can use that skill and some of the drawings to personalize
your world.
Drawings are a natural in the garden, greenhouse, or just a hello from a
sunny window in the depth of winter. Treat yourself to a wonderful
bouquet of flowers and draw it. Revisit a childhood love of wildflowers,
or discover it now; go out and sketch them, from the delicately scent-
ed, early spring trailing arbutus to exotic lady’s slippers and jack-in-the-
pulpits.
Get down close and look at them, smell their scent, enjoy the splendor
of spring, the flush of summer, and the ripeness of fall.
The Art of Drawing
Give yourself the time to enjoy the beauty of everything around you when you’re on a trip.
Take your sketchbook along and record the details of the landscape as well as the feelings you
experience. Then, when you get back to home base, you can use some of your own drawings to
decorate your world at home or work, and go back to those wonderful idylls again and again.
Try Your Hand
They say a picture is worth a
thousand words, so use your
drawings to amplify, identify, illu-
minate, direct, explain, or just
plain decorate, whenever and
wherever you can.
Don’t just wake up and smell the flowers—get out and draw them, too.

317
Chapter 24 ➤Decorate Your World
Now, here’s the best part: Once you’ve got an assortment of botan-
ical drawings, you can use them to illustrate everything from
recipes to your walls.
Trading Information: How-To’s 
or Recipes
People are always swapping information, and you can add the vi-
sual to your explanations, for fun or even for profit. Illustrations
help explain things that would otherwise be difficult or take too
many words. How-to steps make any explanation easier to under-
stand, whether in newspapers, magazines, guidebooks, brochures,
and of course, in the world of nonfiction—there are how-to books
and Complete Idiot’s Guides on every subject there is.
Try illuminating or illustrating one of your favorite recipes. Make
copies and hand them out to friends. Keep a copy of each as well;
you may have the beginning of a manuscript!
Artist’s Sketchbook
Illuminating and illustrating
differ in an important way:
Illumination is decoration, such
as a border around words or a
picture, while illustration shows
the information itself in picture
form.
Decorate your world by illuminating or illustrat-
ing a favorite recipe.

Illustrating an Idea or a Technique
To try an illustration of your own, begin by picking a subject you know
well, such as a gardening technique. Then, follow these simple steps:
1. Write out the steps in detail to explain it to a beginner.
2. Add drawings to your explanation.
Even you will see how much easier it is to explain something with the
addition of illustrations.
Now, pick a subject that you don’t know much about, or an aspect of a
subject you’d like to know more about. Do your research and write out
your notes, but also add sketches, using the simple steps above, to help
you learn the new material and really retain it.
Try Your Hand
Drawing can dramatically speed
the learning process and increase
your powers of retention.
How-to’s become simple
to follow with the addi-
tion of illustrations.
Illustrating an Idea
You can use your drawings to illustrate an idea or accompany anything from a collection of
poems to a poster advertising an event you are volunteering for. Once you’ve gotten start-
ed, though, local charities and organizations will be beating down your door, so watch out!

319
Chapter 24 ➤Decorate Your World
The Story of You
At one time or another, we all seem to have tried our hand at writ-
ing a story, fiction or nonfiction, whether for a child, out of a spe-
cific interest, or because the muse visited and it had to be done.
So, take the next step and illustrate it with your own drawings!
By now it should be clear that your life is just as interesting as the
next guy’s. Why not expand that journal of yours into a larger
piece of illuminated work in a separate volume? Whether specifi-
cally for your travels or all about your family or your own life,
your illuminated journal will grow to be something you’ll treasure
more and more as the years go by. Take it from two middle-aged
gals who know.
Donate your skills to local charities—illustrate flyers for
community events.
Try Your Hand
Your local printer or business of-
fice will help you if you don’t
have a computer and scanner.
Look at what they have posted
as samples and decide what you
want yours to look like.

Illuminating Your Personal Life
Stationery, letterheads, postcards, and personal or business cards are great ways to decorate
your world with your drawings.
Original art for black-and-white reproduction works well when it is reduced about 50 per-
cent, so model your original according to what you have planned. Make a rough design to
show placement of art and type, then look at your choices of type style. You can offer to
make a set of whatever you create for a friend or family member as a most personal gift.
Greeting cards and holiday greetings and invitations to parties are other projects you can try
with your own images. Even without a computer and scanner, you can make up a nice card
front and have good black-and-white or color copies made at your local 24-hour printer to
Illustrate a story—yours or someone else’s—with drawings. Here are a few to inspire you.

321
Chapter 24 ➤Decorate Your World
fold into cards. Then, you can add your own handwritten greeting
or you can write it out in a calligraphic hand on the art and make
it part of the card.
If you do have a computer and scanner, you can read about using
it with your own images in Chapter 25, “Express Yourself.”
Reinventing Your World
As you go on with the reinvention of your world, why not start
with the redecoration of your castle? Almost any corner of your
house can take a little well-placed illumination, such as a flower
here or there to cheer you during the winter, a bit of whimsy for a
child’s room, and in the kitchen, the easiest of all, an arrangement
of fruit that never goes bad.
But you don’t have to stop there when it comes to redecoration.
Any surface can be the object of your newfound drawing skills, as
you’ll discover in this section.
Cabinets and Furniture
You can use your drawings as the basis for painting on cabinet
doors or the drawer fronts of a dresser that needs help. For your
first project, here are some simple steps you can follow.
1. Pick a simple stem and bloom or a length of vine with some
leaves.
2. Make a photocopy of the drawing you intend to use and es-
tablish a color scheme with colored pencils. Keep it fairly
simple.
3. Buy yourself enough colors in acrylic paint to mix the colors
that you will need. If you’d like, look ahead to the section in
Chapter 25 on color for some help.
4. You can transfer your drawing to a cabinet or drawer front by
blackening the back of a copy of the drawing with your soft-
est pencil and then taping it carefully and drawing over your
drawing lines. The soft pencil acts like carbon paper (remem-
ber carbon paper?) and your outline is there on the surface,
ready to paint. This will work for several passes, and then
you might have to reapply the pencil or finish with another
copy of your drawing.
You’re sure to be pleased with the new look in your kitchen or
spare room, or on your bathroom cupboard or old dresser.
Ceilings, Walls, and Floors, but No Driveways
You can apply this same procedure to a larger surface, either in a repeat pattern, such as a
stenciled border around the top of a room, or you could get wild and paint a border on a
floor that looks dull. Hey, you can paint the whole floor; it’s your castle.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Calligraphic writing is handwrit-
ing in a particular style, or font,
often with a wedge-tipped pen
called a calligraphic pen. Chancery
cursive, like old manuscript text, 
or Old English, more elaborate
and stylized, are two styles you 
can try from a book or your word-
processing software. You can type
out your text, choose the font and
size, and print it out as a guide, or
you can simply use a calligraphy
pen in your own handwriting for 
a nice effect.
Back to the Drawing Board
Be sure to practice how you will
paint in the petals and leaves on
a sample before you start on the
furniture. Practice, as always,
makes perfect, which is what
you’re after when you get to the
real thing.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life
322
For repeated use, a stencil will be easier in the long run. You can use it for the basic shapes
and fill the rest in freehand, looking at your sample as a reference.
To cut a stencil you will need some stiff paper, preferably stencil paper, and a sharp Exacto
or mat knife.
1. Draw your design on the paper from your original sketch.
2. Remember that in a stencil the holes will fall out, so you probably need to redraw the
parts of the drawing so they are separate. (Remember that stencils use negative space.
A stencil of a chair would be a series of disconnected “holes” which wouldn’t hold to-
gether, so a separate stencil is required for each part of the chair.)
A stencil can simplify a
drawing.
Expanded Uses for Your Skills
As your confidence in drawing increases, you may want to take a look at still more poten-
tial uses. If you have a lifelong love of fashion, for example, you might want to try some
clothing drawings. Or, if you’re half as witty as we are, maybe a cartoon or bit of visual po-
litical satire will be just the thing. There’s plenty of raw material, after all (pun intended).
Maybe character studies appeal to you. Or, if it’s a flight of fantasy that does it for you,
whatever it is, give it a try.
There are books specific to each of these expanded uses, and many more. Look carefully to
make sure that the book really shows you things you want to know and is not just a show-
case for the artist/author. You’ll find some of our suggestions in Appendix B, “Resources for
Learning to Draw.”
Focus on Fashion
Details, stylization, and stretched proportion are the differences between drawings of people
and fashion drawings, along with the fact that while you draw for yourself, fashion draw-
ings are drawn for use commercially. You get paid to do them!
If this type of drawing interests you, begin by studying the fashion drawings in newspapers
and magazines to develop an eye for the kind of style that is “in” at the moment, the de-
tails that look contemporary, and the degree of “distortion” in the proportion. Evaluate
proportion by measuring by the number of heads in the total body height as you did in

323
Chapter 24 ➤Decorate Your World
Chapter 21, “The Human Body and Its Extremities.” When you’re doing fashion drawing,
there are more “heads” in the total height, that’s all—mostly in the legs, for that leggy
model look. Practice until you develop a style that pleases you.
Fashion isn’t just about
clothing, either—look at
the detail in this fantasy
dragon, just perfect to be
embroidered on a cou-
ture runway gown.
Cartoons: Humor or Opinion?
How funny are you? Are you an opinionated type? You might be a cartoonist in disguise.
Cartoons are great drawing practice, and you don’t have to have a lot of skill, as many of
today’s cartoons reveal. The trick with humorous cartoons like comic strips is consistency,
making your characters look the same from frame to frame.
With political cartoons and caricatures, it’s a matter of discerning your subject’s most
prominent feature and then exaggerating it for recognition. Studying the masters can help
you see how this is done—from George W. Bush’s ears to Al Gore’s hairline.
That Twisted Look: Caricatures
If you do have an eye for facial features and how to push them or exaggerate them, draw-
ing caricatures is a possibility. You can look forward to a future at county fairs, or you could
move to Paris and set up along the Seine.
Further Out: Your Fantasies
There is nothing that, with a twist of imagination, cannot become something else.
—William Carlos Williams
Some of us are just not content with reality. Why, after all, should reality be the only op-
tion? Your fantasies or fantasy worlds are places you can go with your drawings. Just don’t
forget your sketchbook.

Do you remember the first time you saw a color television? Do you remember that Walt
Disney’s “The Wonderful World of Color” was originally created to showcase material for
color television? It’s hard to imagine now, but the move from black and white to color tele-
vision was a very big deal back in the late ’50s. And in 1939, when Judy Garland first
opened the door of her Kansas farmhouse into the Land of Oz, the color was a revelation—
to her, to Toto, and to us.
Moving into the realm of color in your drawing is a big deal, too. But never fear—we’re
here to help, with suggestions for everything from materials to matting.
Some Brief Words on Color
I paint because color is significant.
—Georgia O’Keeffe
This is yet another pearl from O’Keeffe, and so it is. Each day of your life is filled with
shapes and colors, the weather, the seasons, the places you go, and the things that you see,
so add some of that color to your drawings.
As with most parts of this book, a whole book could be written on color, and fortunately,
many have been. Along with your own experimenting, it’s probably worthwhile to read and
study a few of them.
Before you jump, spend some time reading and looking at colored work that you like. Take
a good look at color charts, in books and in art stores. Get familiar with the spectrum of
colors: the burst of reds, the range of yellows, the forest of greens, the sea of blues, the
wealth of purples.
New Materials You Could Try
Colored pencils and water-soluble colored pencils and crayons are a great and painless tran-
sition into the world of color. After all, you’ve already gotten comfortable with a pencil, so
adding color is easy! They mix and blend to make any color you can come up with.
Other options in the field of color are
➤Water-based crayons.
➤Pastel pencils.
➤Pastels.
➤Oil pastels.
➤Watercolors.
➤Acrylic or gouache.
➤Pen and colored inks.
Each of these media has its own characteristics, advantages, and chal-
lenges; practice will allow you to develop a feel for them. And, if you’re
interested in learning about any of them in more detail, we’ve suggest-
ed some books you might like in Appendix B, “Resources for Learning
to Draw.”

As you begin to look at colors,
do yourself a favor and stay away
from the pile of browns. You will
find that in learning to mix col-

them anyway.

329
Chapter 25 ➤Express Yourself
Into the Field of Color
Buy yourself the largest set of colored pencils that you can afford. Is your birthday coming?
Even if it’s not, no matter, get the big set anyway. Small sets have mostly bright primary
colors and fewer subtle colors, and you’ll want to play with both.
Primary colors are those that cannot be mixed from other colors:
➤Red
➤Yellow
➤Blue
Secondary colors are those that can be mixed from two primary colors. The secondary 
colors are
➤Orange (made from red and yellow).
➤Green (from yellow and blue).
➤Purple (from blue and red).
Tertiary colors are another step out on the color wheel, made from a primary and a second-
ary color. They are a group of lovely muted shades and neutral colors that you’ll want to
get to know.
Colors across from each other on the color wheel are called complimentary colors; they
work well with each other. If they are mixed, they make neutrals. Colors that compliment
each other are
➤Red and green.
➤Blue and orange.
➤Purple and yellow.
This color wheel is in
black and white, but you
can use your imagination
to visualize the colors.
Blended colors are a mix of two or three colors or two complimentary colors—opposites on
the color wheel.
Earth tones and shadow colors are mixes of complimentary colors like purple, with a little
yellow to soften it, or a brick red made with green. You will end up with plenty of browns
and earth colors, and you can make various grays and blacks by combining four colors, ex-
cluding yellow.

Taking a Stab at a Colored Drawing
Use good paper. The best is 140-lb. hot-press watercolor paper, and 90 lb. is fine for sketches.
If you foresee adding water to the water-soluble pencil sketch, however, the heavier paper
will work better.
You will find that you can very naturally grab a handful of colored pencils and start in on a
simple arrangement.
➤That fistful of colors is important. Keep switching colors.
➤Look at each object and see the range of colors you can use, or
the layers you can build up to get a tone and a color.
➤It takes time, but it’s fun to see the color happen along with the
drawing.
If you want to learn more about any of the colored media, take a class.
They’re fun and you can learn a lot about color and techniques for
handling the various media. You’ll be glad you did.
Caring for Your Work
Generally speaking, use the best materials you can, take yourself and
your efforts seriously, present your work simply so it can stand on its
own, take care of what you don’t frame, and the archivists and art his-
torians of the future will thank you. Caring for your work now means
your children, grandchildren, and even your Great-great-great grand-
children will have it hanging on their walls (even if they’d rather have
it in their closets).

mentary colors from

Try Your Hand
To learn about color, make your-
self lots of small tonal charts for
the colors you have. Try for gra-
dations of tone in an individual
color to see what it does, and
mixed colors in a variety of tones.
Be sure to label the charts so you
know how you made a color that
you like.

Whether it’s storage, matting, or framing, here’s some of the best
information you’ll find for taking care of your drawings after the
drawing’s over.
On Storage
You’ve spent a lot of time on your work, so treat it right when
you’re finished, too. Portfolios keep your work safe, clean, and flat,
as it should be. Paper storage drawers are expensive and take up
space, but they’re well worth it if you’ve got the money and the
room.
The important thing is to store your work somewhere where it will
be kept in its natural state: flat. In addition, you’ll want to keep it
away from damaging sun rays and—even more damaging—water,
so next to the garage window or in the basement next to the
sump pump are probably not the best places.
Matting and Framing
Less is more. Simple is as simple does. White is right. Art, or its mat, should not be expected
to match the couch.
In other words, forget the fuschia or lime green mats to match the flowers on the rug. Your
work will look best in a simple white or off-white mat and a simple wood frame that can be
more or less the color of the other woods where you plan to hang it. The important thing is
that the choices help the drawing; it will find its place on the wall.
Turning a New Page: Fine Art Meets Tech Art

Arles is bleak, and the blasted mistral keeps me indoors. I go days without speaking a word to
anyone. Thank you for the money. With it, I bought a blazing tangerine iMac, which I am E-
mailing you on right now. You were right, the Hotmail account was very simple to set up and
free, so I can still survive on five francs a day.
—Noah Baumbach, “Van Gogh in AOL,” The New Yorker
Can you imagine Vincent with an iMac? He probably would have felt more connected and
maybe less troubled. One thing’s for certain—the high-tech world is having an effect on al-
most everyone. You can run but you can’t hide, so jump in—you might like it more than
you ever imagined.
Creating a Virtual Sketchbook
Creating a virtual sketchbook is as simple as a few peripherals for your computer—a scanner
and a color printer. Which scanner and printer you buy will depend on both your budget
and your desires. We leave it to your local big-box computer store to help you with the
myriad choices, but we can help you with the basic how-to’s once you’ve got your equip-
ment.
Try Your Hand
Start with a light color for your
planning lines. Lavender works
very well because it blends into
almost any color, and it can 
become a shadow if the lines are
outside your objects as you de-
fine them more closely.

Scanning Your Images
Most flat scanners are designed to read images up to 81/2" × 14", so if your drawings are larg-
er than that, you’ll have to scan them in sections. The process may be unwieldy and the re-
sults, less-than-desirable reproductions of your drawings. If you’ve been doing a lot of your
sketching on the road, though, you probably did so in a small enough sketchbook.
Is there a drawing that you particularly like? Start with that one. Tear it carefully from your
sketchbook and then lay it flat on your scanner and scan it in (you’ll need your manufac-
turer’s instructions for this, and there’s no way we can help you with those).
After you’ve scanned your image, the program will ask you to save it. Give it a name you’ll
remember it by: “Laguna Sunset” or “Fisherman on the Gila” are two good examples.
Now, you can look at your work with the imaging program that came with your scanner, or,
if you decide you don’t like that program, another that you’ve downloaded off the World
Wide Web. One of the things that you can do, once the image of your drawing is saved to
your computer, is manipulate it. That means you can erase those extra scribbles in the cor-
ner without fear of going through the paper, or you can add some lines to the fisherman’s
face. Don’t get carried away, though—we think real drawing’s a lot more fun than virtual
drawing.
Printing Your Images
You can also print your images, of course, once you’ve scanned them into your computer
and saved them. If your drawings are in black and white, you won’t even need a color
printer. Even the popular—and inexpensive—bubble-jet printers do a great job with graphic
images, which is what your drawing is.
E-Mailing with Your Own Art
Now that you’ve got it on your computer, you may want to e-mail your art to all your
friends. So long as attachments are an option with your particular e-mail, e-mailing your art
is simple: Save it as a small .jpg file, add it to your e-mail as an attachment, and then write
your note. Poof! Off it goes to annoy one or all of your friends—just like all the jokes that
they’ve already seen three times.
Creating Your Own Illustrated Home Page
To: Theovg23@aol.com
From: Vincent2@VanGo.com
I’ve started to work again. Check out my home page (and note new address). I designed it
with a soft malachite green, a fiery iMac raspberry and a troubled Prussian lilac. I may’ve
mastered the brushstroke and HTML, but am a novice with Java. There’s always more to
learn.
—Noah Baumbach, “Van Gogh in AOL,” The New Yorker
There are classes in HTML and Java, two of the most popular Web languages, and there are
editorial programs that make it much easier to create a Web site of your own. You can also
customize the home page on your Internet program. One example to take a look at is
Lauren’s home page, the first page of her Web site at www.laurenjarrett.com. Check it out!

333
Chapter 25 ➤Express Yourself
Creating your own illustrated home page is now as simple as following the instructions
your e-mail provider probably has set up on your ISP home page. You don’t even have to
know any special programs anymore; the directions will walk you through it all, including
how to download the art you’ve scanned and saved onto your own illustrated home page.
If you’re interested in something truly professional-looking, however, we’d highly recom-
mend a Web designer. You get what you pay for, after all.
How to Learn About Drawing 
on the Computer
We may be the old-fashioned, middle-aged artist/teacher types—
although we are anything but old-fashioned or middle-aged—but
we think you should do your drawing first, and then scan it.
You will not really learn to see and draw anything on a computer.
Sure, you can make pictures, but it’s just not the same as direct
hands-on drawing.
Drawing with a mouse or stylus and art pad is not the same as
drawing with a pencil. There is not the same connection when you
can’t look at the hand that’s drawing and see what’s going on. In
addition, the feel of a fine piece of paper and the internal dialogue
that you have while you’re relating to your subject, seeing, and
drawing are basic pleasures, time for your inner self, and the path
to your own unique creative soul.
Computer Art Programs You Can Learn
Now then, the tirade is over. Computer graphics programs are a dif-
ferent story, because they are a way of using your drawings after
you have made them, for everything from cards, presents, posters,
and all kinds of commercial uses, should you be so inclined.
Adobe Photoshop and Quark are two great programs for using art.
Lauren uses one or the other for everything, and they’re well worth
the time to learn. Photoshop can do anything you can think of to
an image, or montage of images, with or without type. Quark is the
favored layout program, but you can use PageMaker as well. Adobe
Illustrator uses imported art, too, but it has more bells and whistles.
There are lots of other art and graphics programs available for Macs
or PCs. You can draw with a mouse or a stylus and art pad, using
the shapes, colors, graphics, and special effects of programs like
Canvas, Paint, Appleworks, and SmartDraw, to name a few. In addi-
tion, there are specialized programs, such as AutoCad for architec-
tural, landscape, and mechanical rendering; 3-D and special effects
programs; and the many programs for Web design and interactives.
Take your pick. They all have huge manuals, but you can do it if
you try. We admit to being Luddites, and so we stick to the pro-
grams that work for us.
Artist’s Sketchbook
Graphic images on your com-
puter are any images that are not
text-based. Different images have
different suffixes (those are the
letters that appear after the dot
on a filename, including .jpg,
.ipg, .bmp, .gif, and many oth-
ers). Graphic images also take up
a lot more memory on your
computer, but if you’ve got a
current model, you won’t need
to worry about them using up
your available memory for years,
if ever. 
The Art of Drawing
Consider private tutoring if you
can manage it, or maybe you can
share a tutorial with a friend who
is also interested, to halve the
cost. You will learn much, much
faster in a private tutorial. It’s
like having a personal trainer!

How to Choose a Computer Art Class
There are more and more computer classes out there, with the usual brochures and course
descriptions to wade through, including schedules, prices, credits (if you care), and residual
computerese (language designed to confuse you) to deal with and experience. Specific
courses for complicated graphics programs like Photoshop, Quark, or Illustrator are very
helpful places to start.
Our advice:
➤Ask around. Chances are, someone you know (or their cousin) has already taken the
course and can comment.
➤Find out the instructor’s name, and decide if the course material, time, place, and fee
are acceptable.
➤Call the instructor, and make sure you will learn what you want to learn.
Our final word on the high-tech world is that it really is a great tool. Think of it that way
and you will learn it and use it properly. Lauren’s computer, scanner, printers, copy ma-
chine, and fax take up a whole wall in what is otherwise a painter’s studio, but hey, we all
have to make a living and the two sides coexist quite well. Lisa’s computer is her main tool,
aside from her old Underwood manual and assortment of notebooks and pens for all occa-
sions, so it gets to live in her way, smack in the middle of her desk.
Do yourself a favor and learn to draw, if that is what you want to do. Then worry about
what to do with the drawings later.

In This Chapter
➤Artists on their work
➤A walk through the museum
➤Taking the Zen path to drawing
➤Inspiration is where you find it
Paintings must be looked at and looked at and looked at—they, I think, the good ones, like it.
They must be understood and that’s not the word either, through the eyes. No talking, no
writing, no singing, no dancing will explain them. They are the final, the ‘nth whoopee of
sight. A watermelon, a kiss may be fair, but after all have other uses. “Look at that!” is all
that can be said before a great painting, at least, by those who really see it.
—Charles Demuth
In this chapter, we’ll be finding out where artists discover their inspiration—and we’ll let
them tell you in their own words. If you draw for any length of time, you’ll soon discover
that finding the muse is the easy part; it’s paying attention that’s a bit more difficult.
Artists also get their inspiration from other artists, and we’ll be exploring museums as well.
With all this artistic inspiration, you’ll be ready to venture out into the world as an artist
yourself. Happy trails.
The good picture—No one wonders at it more than the one who created it.
—John Marin
Following the Muse
She’s out there all right, that muse the poets are always looking to for help with a rhyme. If
you draw regularly and sincerely, she’s bound to pay you a visit, too. She can take different
forms, but you will know she’s there and what she wants of you. And you’ll soon discover
that you had better pay attention when your muse speaks to you.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life

Where Artists Find Inspiration
Every artist—whether visual, written, musical, or kinesthetic—knows what it’s like to be 
inspired. While explaining that inspiration is difficult, Lauren has collected a group of won-
derful words from artists who really do explain what it’s like to be inspired in their own par-
ticular ways. Your own inspiration will be as individual and unique as each of these artists’.
My adoration of the great ancients who laid the indestructible, immutable foundations of art
for all time shall never dim or tarnish. Their legacy has always been and will always be my
spiritual refreshment and renewal. The great ancients worked with God. They interpreted and
embodied the glory and wonder of the elements. The moderns work with geometry.
—Max Weber
True art cannot spring but from naivete. Everyone has been a child, and the true artist is the
one that has preserved intact all those treasures of great sensitivity felt in early childhood …
Time goes on, but the first songs ever sung by nature always sing on in his soul.
—Joseph Stella
The most important thing about a river is that it runs downhill. Simple, isn’t it? Art is pro-
duced by the wedding of art and nature. Go look at the bird’s flight, the man’s walk, the sea’s
movement. They have a way to keep their motion. Nature’s laws of motion have to be obeyed
and you have to follow along. The good picture embraces the laws, the best of the old did, and
that’s what gives them life.
—John Marin
Science and art are indeed sisters, but they are very different in their tastes, and it is no easy
task to cultivate with advantage the favor of both.
—James M. Dunlop
What They Have to Say About Their Work
Artists are pretty chatty types, for people working in a language without words. In fact,
maybe that’s why they’re so talkative. Or maybe they prefer to write about their work so
some art historian doesn’t come along and do it for them. Here’s what some of them have
to say about their work, and what they believe.
My work has been continuously based on a clue seen in nature from which the subject of a
picture may be projected. Nature, with its profound order, is an inexhaustible source of supply.
Its many facets lend themselves to all who would help themselves for their particular needs.
Each one may filter out for himself that which is essential to him. Our chief object is to in-
crease our capacity for perception. The degree of accomplishment determines the caliber of the
Artist.
—Charles Sheeler
I grew up pretty much as everybody else grows up … and one day I found myself saying to
myself … I can’t live where I want to … I can’t go where I want to … I can’t even say what I
want to … School and things that painters have taught me even keep me from painting the
way I want to. I decided I was a very stupid fool not to at least paint as I wanted to and say
what I wanted to when I painted, as that seemed to be the only thing I could do that didn’t
concern anybody but myself … and that was nobody’s business but my own … I found I could

339
Chapter 26 ➤The Artist’s Life
say things with color and shapes that I couldn’t say in any other way … things I had no
words for.
—Georgia O’Keeffe
My aim is to escape from the medium with which I work. To leave no residue of technical
mannerisms to stand between my expression and the observer. To seek freedom through signif-
icant form and design rather than through the diversion of so-called free and accidental brush
handling. In short, to dissolve into clear air all impediments that might interrupt the flow of
pure enjoyment. Not to exhibit craft, but rather to submerge it, and make it rightfully the
handmaiden of beauty, power, and emotional content.
—Andrew Wyeth
An artist must paint, not what he sees in nature, but what is there. To do so he must invent
symbols, which, if properly used, make his work seem even more real than what is in front of
him. He does not try to bypass nature; his work is superior to nature’s surface appearance, but
not to its basic laws.
—Charles Burchfield
There was a long period of searching for something in color which I called a “Condition of
Light.” It applied to all objects in nature, flowers, trees, people, apples, cows … To under-
stand that clearly, go to nature, or to the Museum of Natural History and see the butterflies.
Each has its own orange, blue, black, white, yellow, brown, green, and black, all carefully
chosen to fit the character of life going on in that individual entity.
—Arthur Dove
The Art of Drawing
It does not bore me to write that I can’t paint a pawtreet [sic]. On the contrary it is the great-
est joy in life—but I prefer writing it to you rather than the lady, if you will be good enough to
tell her that I have retired from the business. Tell her that I now only paint landscapes and reli-
gious decorations, that I am a waltzer to delirium tremens or whatever you think may make her
congratulate herself on her refusal. I really am shutting up shop in the portrait line.
John Singer Sargent
I like to seize one sharp instant in nature, imprison it by means of ordered shapes and space
relationships to convey the ecstasy of the moment. To this end I eliminate and simplify, leav-
ing apparently nothing but color and pattern. But with these I attempt to build an organic
whole—a canvas which will stand independently. If I capture too some of the beauty, mys-
tery, and timelessness of nature I am happy.
—Milton Avery

The love you liberate in your work is the only love you keep.
—Maurice Prendergast
Museum Walks
There is nothing as nice as a day in a museum, a day full of visual stimulation and the com-
pany of the masters, old or new. Museums are also great places for a date, or an affair, or a
date with an old affair—not that either one of us has done that, of
course.
The Wealth of Museums
In the museum, it’s all there for the looking—rooms and rooms and
long halls and hidden corners filled with forgotten gems.
Go and look at drawings, paintings, sculpture, jewelry, objects, furni-
ture, fabric, costumes, china, and more. You won’t want to overdo it,
so decide what you want to see and then stop before you get over-
whelmed.
Then there are all the specialized museums, such as natural history mu-
seums and science museums, full of specimens—huge skeletons and
dioramas of tiny little nocturnal animals you would never see outside
of a museum. There are plants, too, and birds and butterflies enough to
last you into the next millennium.
Styles of Drawing Through History
Styles of drawing through history; yikes, we could write forever on that one. Just go to the
museum and look, then do it a few dozen more times and you will have a rough idea about
styles of drawing through history.
You will see how artists have developed
➤from the early cave drawings,
➤to the flattened drawings attempting three-dimensional figures done by the Egyptians,
➤to the very realistic sculpture done in ancient Greece (by folks who could certainly
draw well),
➤to the more primitive, flat religious images produced in the Middle Ages,
➤to the interest in perspective and shape in the Renaissance, and
➤to the fine attention to detail in Flemish paintings by the Old Masters, the strict tradi-
tion of studio work in the Classical Period.
Then, the Barbizon artists started painting outside of all things, and the first dissension oc-
curred when the Impressionists started breaking loose. Then there was the heyday of Post-
Impressionists, including the Nabis, Fauvists, Cubists, Expressionists, Dadaists, and all the
rest of the ways that artists decided to explore and express, right into our recent century
and the one we just entered, including the most recent versions of old schools and the
“shock of the new.”
It’s a lot to see!
Try Your Hand
Mr. Homer, do you ever take
the liberty in painting nature of
modifying the color of any part?
Never! Never! When I have se-
lected a thing carefully, I paint it
exactly as it appears.

Chapter 26 ➤The Artist’s Life
Learn by Looking, Then Try a Copy
Museums put the benches there just for you—yes, you, with the sketchbook. Go sit down
on that nice bench in front of a piece of art that you like. Make yourself comfortable—the
benches aren’t, but who cares, you could even take a pillow. You can learn from just look-
ing, but get out your pencil and draw what you like or what you want to remember, the di-
agonals in the composition, the shape of a tree, how a flower was drawn, the features of a
portrait—whatever you like, you draw.
Drawing from sculpture or objects is better practice in three-dimensional drawing. That
beautiful torso, imposing warrior, or delicately shaped vase is there in space and presents
you with a lifetime of potential drawing. Some possibilities:
➤Arrange yourself for simple views and then try more challenging ones with foreshort-
ening.
➤Draw parts of figures and the whole.
➤Draw the details in a set of armor or the looming figures on a crypt, the subtle propor-
tion of a Ming vase, or the scrollwork on a Japanese table.
The more you draw, the more you will see to draw. It may begin to seem as if you can never
go home again.
What Do You Like?
By now, you have developed some opinions along with your sore
butt. You may not know all there is to know about art, but you
know what you like. Some work will pull you back every time you
go, while others become part of your visual memory. No matter
what, everything has its place.
Sharing Your Work
Another thing that’s probably happening by now is that you’re
feeling pleased with your efforts and your growth from a beginner
to a developing draftsman. Chances are your friends and family
have seen your work and have perhaps gotten a little interested
themselves.
The Art of Drawing
Art history books will put particular drawings into historical context and add interesting informa-
tion about the artist or the period or the various schools of thought at the time. But don’t take
our word for it, take the word of a wonderful painter, Charles Demuth. “Look at that!” is all
that can be said before a great painting, at least, by those who really see it.
Back to the Drawing Board
Don’t be afraid to submit your
sketches to other publications if
you think they are applicable for
the style and content of the pub-
lication. You never know, and you
can’t win if you don’t play.

Part 7 ➤Enjoying the Artist’s Life
342
Now, you can begin to share your enthusiasms, your experiences, and your work with the
rest of the world. Someone else may do the same for you: What goes around comes around,
and all of us will benefit.
Most towns have art groups, art classes, maybe a small museum or community center that
shows art, discussion groups, guest lectures, school programs, visiting artists, and local fairs
that include art exhibits. It’s your choice—whether to join, how much time to spend,
should you volunteer or just look—but you do usually get something out of participation in
community events. But you won’t know unless you try. Here are some possibilities.
To Show, to Publish, or Just to Draw
Sometimes you just need to get out of the house with your work to get a better look at it
and where you want to take it next. The white walls of an exhibition hall can allow you to
see your work differently, for better or worse. Even if the experience sends you back to the
drawing board, you will have learned something and can go on from there.
Publishing your work is a thrill in itself. There’s nothing like the printed page and that cred-
it line underneath your image. Start with your local paper if you have landscape or wildlife
sketches that might work as decorative spots, or if you have developed a cartoon style or
have taken up caricatures of the locals.
All this diversion is fun, but try not to let yourself get diverted from the real business of see-
ing and drawing every day. It takes a long time to learn how to draw well, and, though you
may have come a long way, there is still a long way to go. Trust that it is a good road, and
take the time to go there.
Take a Path to the Zen of Drawing
The peace and serenity you can gain from drawing is perhaps the best reason for simply at-
tending to seeing and drawing. We live in a world that is too focused on achievement and
not enough on centering and introspection.
Give yourself the gift of balance and oneness with your work and the world. Do your draw-
ing with nothing else in mind but the relationship you are experiencing between your sub-
ject, your work, and yourself. The timelessness and serenity is its own very deep reward.
Express Yourself.

343
Chapter 26 ➤The Artist’s Life
Encourage and Support Your Creativity
Remember to always support your own process, feed your own spirit, and nourish your cre-
ativity as the special part of you.
You are the one who has to deal with the outside forces, make time amidst all the distrac-
tions, ignore the demands for your personal time, and those who try to discourage your ef-
forts.
Then, too, there is Old Lefty, who’s still out there, waiting for his chance, but you know
what to do with him by now.
Knowing When to Push Yourself Higher
We know well how difficult the balancing act that is life in the twenty-first century is: sup-
porting one’s own creativity, finding the time for work, taking one’s work seriously, feeling
the peace from the time spent, the satisfaction from the learning and the accomplishment,
and yet constantly striving for more.
Remember, no matter what, that you are your own best critic and fan, alternately and at
once. Trust yourself, your inner voice, and your instincts, and banish those critical voices
where they belong—hung out to dry with Old Lefty.
One Inspiring Tale to End
A recent interview on NPR was with Harry Shapiro, who, at 100 years old, is painting full
time. He came to the United States from Russia in 1905 at 5 years old, and grew up in New
York, where he was an avid student of American history and took art classes. Shapiro be-
came an illustrator/commercial artist, but has always painted on weekends and vacations.
During his interview, Shapiro spoke in a clear, melodic voice about painters he admires and
his commitment to painting. He has never had a major illness and believes “art and music
preserve life,” as well as “a heart full of love.” He “works with some urgency now,” and
would like another four or five good years of work to “do some good paintings to sum it
up.”
I know there is a God in some form.
I paint to make things whole.
—Harry Shapiro
You don’t get better than that. Thank you, Harry.
With Our Best Wishes
We have both enjoyed researching and writing this book. Besides the fun we have had “our
own selves,” we’ve also found pleasure in developing the ideas for the book, trying out the
exercises, and writing and honing the text and the directions. Watching it become a book
was a pleasure.
Lauren has enticed her friends over to “draw for their dinner” to make some of the draw-
ings for the book (she is a good cook), and worked with her mother’s drawing group for
some of the others. Still other drawings and responses come from her classes, and she found
a few old treasured pieces, hidden away in her file drawers.

Lisa has enlisted her daughter to make a few drawings around her house so both sides of
the country are represented. As her daughter was temporarily camped out with her during
the writing of this book, it was only fair.
We hope you enjoy this book for a while and dip back into it whenever you want an idea, a
tip, some encouragement, or some of our soon-to-be-world-famous wit.
We leave you with the best set of guidelines we know: Be well, be happy, encourage your-
self. Try to follow them, and you’ll soon be guiding others as well.
The Least You Need to Know
➤The world is your oyster. Draw it.
➤Time and tide wait for no man (or woman). Draw it now.
➤A rose is a rose is a rose, until you start to draw it.
➤Love the world in your drawing and in all your work, and the world will love you
back.

Appendix C
Drawing Glossary
al fresco
Italian for “in the fresh air;” it is the term for doing things outside—including
drawing, of course.
artists’ studios
range from converted closets to converted guest houses. Where you put
your studio depends on where you have room, of course, but its individuality can be what-
ever you choose.
cairns
man-made trail markings, most often piles of rocks that mark the trailside path.
Adding these mini-structures to your drawing can lead the viewer onto the trail, too.
calligraphic
handwriting in a particular style, or font, often with a wedge-tipped pen
called a calligraphic pen.
chiaroscuro
Italian for light and shadow. It refers here to a system of tonal shading to
render an object so it appears three-dimensional.
color wheel
a way of showing primary and secondary colors. The circle is divided into
sixths, and the primary colors—red, yellow, and blue—are in every other wedge. In between
each of them are the secondary colors—orange, green, and purple—which are made by
mixing the primaries on either side of them.
contour drawing
any drawing in which the lines represent the edge of a form, shape, or
space; the edge between two forms, shapes, or spaces; or the shared edge between groups of
forms, shapes, or spaces.
drawing
a way of representing what we see by placing lines onto a surface.
dry-erase pens
pens designed to mark on smooth surfaces and wipe off easily. Delis use
them for writing the day’s specials. Look for them in an art or stationery store.
en plein air
a French term meaning “full of fresh air.” It refers here to painting done out-
of-doors. Because classic painting had been done in studios, painting outside was a radical
move.
eye level (see also, horizon line)
straight out from where you are, neither above nor below
the level of your view. As you move up or down, your eye level and view change.
filters
the process of noticing only what we need to in any given scene. Frames are a simi-
lar sensory device, where we ignore what’s outside of what we want to look at.
fixative
protects an unstable surface; it is sprayed on a finished drawing to protect it after
you’ve completed it.

Appendix C
350
foreshortening
the illusion of spatial depth. It is a way to portray a three-dimensional ob-
ject on a two-dimensional plane (like piece of paper). The object appears to project beyond
or recede behind the picture plane by visual distortion.
gesture drawings
drawn from short poses, no more than four minutes and often as short
as one minute.
graphic images
any images on your computer that are not text-based. Different image
formats have different extensions (the letters that appear after the dot on a filename, in-
cluding .jpg, .ipg, .bmp, .gif, and many others).
hardnesses (for pencils)
range from the very hard Hs, which you can use to make a faint
line, to the very soft Bs, which are smudgier, ranging from 6H all the way to 6B. Regular
pencils are numbered as to hardness on the end.
high, middle, and low horizons
represent how eye level is perceived and rendered in a
drawing.
horizon line (or eye level)
your point of view relative to what you are looking at. It is the
point at which all planes and lines vanish.
illumination
decoration, such as a border around words or a picture. 
illustration
shows the information itself in picture form.
lateralization
the way specific functions or tasks are handled by the brain, whether by
one side or the other or both. The brain is comprised of two hemispheres, the analytical
and logical left brain and the more intuitive and holistic right brain. While Westerners tend
to use their left brains far more, drawing is largely a function of the right brain.
negative space
the area around an object or objects that share edges with those objects or
shapes.
paper stomp
anything from paper to finger that can smudge a line, can make interesting
tones and blurred areas. Harder lines can be drawn or redrawn on top of the initial render-
ing for more definition.
parallelogram
a geometric shape having four sides. Each pair of opposite sides is parallel
and equidistant to each other.
perspective
the perception that objects farther away are smaller than objects that are 
closer to us.
picture plane
a piece of plastic or Plexiglas through which you view a subject and on
which you draw it.
primary colors
the basic colors—red, yellow, and blue—which can’t be mixed from other
colors.
proportion
the comparative relation between things; in a rectangle, the comparative ratio
between the height and width. Rectangles of different sizes that are in proportion share the
same ratio in their height and width.
range
the distance between you and your objects—close-up (objects), mid-range (still life),
or far away (landscape).
scale
in drawing, the rendering of relative size. An object or person or tree, as it is seen
farther away, seems smaller than another of the same size that is closer.

351
Drawing Glossary
secondary colors
colors mixed from pairs of primary colors. Red and yellow make orange,
yellow and blue make green, and blue and red make purple.
square
90-degrees, at right angles, as in the sides of a rectangle. Measuring carefully off
center lines helps keep your rectangle square.
still life
called nature mort (which means “dead natural things” in French), a collection
and arrangement of things in a composition.
tertiary colors
made from mixing two secondary colors; include soft taupes, grays, and
neutrals.
trompe l’oeil
French for “trick of the eye.” Trompe l’oeil techniques involve making the
eye “see” something that is painted seem so three-dimensional you can’t quite believe it
isn’t really there.
2-D
an abbreviation for two-dimensional, having the dimensions of height and width,
such as a flat surface, like a piece of paper. 3-D is an abbreviation for three-dimensional,
having the dimensions of height, width, and depth, an object in space.
vantage point
the place from which you view something and just exactly what, of that
whole picture, you are choosing to see and draw. It is the place from which you pick your
view from the larger whole, rather like cropping a photograph. If you move, your exact
vantage point changes.
vellum surface
drawing paper that has a velvety soft finish that feels good as you draw; it
can handle a fair amount of erasing.
viewfinder frame
a “window” through which you see an image and can relate the angles,
lines, shapes, and parts—to the measuring marks on the frame and to each other. It is as
simple as using your two hands to frame a view or making a cardboard frame.
viewpoint
similar to eye level, but think of it as specifically where your eyes are, whether
you are looking up, across, or down at something. Eye level is where you look straight out
from that particular viewpoint. Things in your view are above, at, or below eye level. If you
move, your view and eye level move, too.
Zen
more than a religious practice, it’s a philosophy and way of life that comes from
Japanese Zen Buddhism. At its most basic, Zen can be thought of as a holistic approach to
being that takes for granted the interconnectedness of all things and encourages simplicity
in living in order to live with the complex.
