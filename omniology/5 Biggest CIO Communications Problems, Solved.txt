5 Biggest CIO Communications Problems, Solved
Introduction
As a tech leader, you recognize that disruption is a 
fact of life. According to Gartner, enterprise IT has 
entered an era of digitalization where disruptive 
new products are providing a continuous stream 
of growth, innovation, and differentiation. IT  
overhauls in business productivity—moving to 
the cloud, supporting a remote workforce, and 
preserving valuable legacy data while maintaining 
security and control—are necessary for your 
business to remain competitive. These changes 
require communications solutions that can 
keep pace with the accelerating demands of the 
connected world.
Technology is 
the Backbone of 
Competition
94% of the CIO role 
should include leading 
tech transformation or 
tech-driven innovation 
and strategy, according to 
a 2014 survey of CIOs by 
Harvard Business Review.
“To succeed in a digital world, 
enterprises...must focus on the future 
by starting from a digital perspective 
and working backward.”

Introduction
Today, people connect in deeper and more 
personal ways than ever before—collaborating 
inside and outside their organizations, co-creating 
in real time, and breaking physical barriers. 
Technology plays a huge role in facilitating these 
connections, but IT infrastructure isn’t always 
scaled to meet business needs.
Modern business happens from virtually anywhere; 
teams rely on hyperconnectivity and the ability to 
work seamlessly from a multitude of locations, on 
a multitude of devices. This era of digitalization 
demands that employees are equipped with tools 
that enable collaboration and productivity—
anytime, anywhere, and on any platform. 
This e-book explores 5 key problems 
that CIOs face, and that often inhibit IT 
business leaders from implementing 
modern communications solutions. 
When these blockers are removed, 
implementation becomes an obvious 
choice—enabling businesses to find 
and maintain their competitive edge.

You likely approach changes and upgrades to 
technology with a healthy amount of skepticism, 
and for good reason: change requires enormous 
effort. It can take several months of planning 
to develop a sound IT strategy that follows the 
broader vision for your business as a whole. 
A solution that disrupts existing workflows or 
calls for extra upfront effort from stakeholders 
might require a significant financial investment. 
Additionally, there are new user interfaces to 
socialize, new capabilities to teach, and new 
metrics to track and act on. Sometimes, all that 
effort is made without a clear improvement to 
your workflow or your bottom line, leaving you 
wondering if the disruption was worth it.
As moving to the cloud, customer engagement, 
enterprise social networks, and business analytics 
change the broader technology landscape, 
planned upgrades need to be worthwhile.
45% of IT budget allocation 
supports change and 
growth, according to a  
2014 Deloitte CIO survey.

Abrupt changes can temporarily destabilize day-to-
day work at all levels. As inefficient and clunky as legacy 
technology can be, many folks are comfortable with it; it’s 
familiar and they understand its idiosyncrasies. However, 
resistance to valuable change means organizations will slip 
behind the competition. 
The most effective IT leaders will remain focused on 
their businesses’ collaboration needs of tomorrow. They 
realize that implementing new solutions is critical to their 
employees’ future needs. CIOs want to create a digital 
ecosystem where employees feel at ease with technology, 
confident in its capabilities, and willing to learn and adopt 
new tools to be happy and successful in their roles.
It Costs Time and 
Money to Implement 
New Solutions
54% of American CIOs 
believe they are taking 
a larger role as digital 
leaders, according to the 
Gartner survey, “Global

There are a myriad of variables that need 
to be assessed prior to shifting or changing 
your solutions platform; chief among them 
is compatibility. Legacy systems need to be 
recognized and made readable; hardware 
and software solutions must work together 
harmoniously; and multiple apps need to 
complement each other. There needs to be 
clear practices in place to ensure record-
keeping and process continuity. 
Incompatibility Can 
Wreak Havoc
Without consideration prior to 
implementation, compatibility issues can 
short-circuit collaboration. Why solve 
one headache with a solution that could 
potentially lead to a few more?

No matter what you’re told before purchase, 
there’s no guarantee that a new communication 
solution will satisfy every need. You might have 
doubts about how intuitive the interface will be 
for your teams, or how robust a solution might 
be, amongst others. 
Skepticism is natural, particularly when IT 
investment allocations are so critical to business 
success. Experience is the ultimate educator, 
and all technology solutions need to be tested 
against the nuances of your particular business.
