Introduction
Introduction
Complex Functions Theory (or the Theory of Analytic Functions is a classical and central topic of
Mathematics. Its applications in Physics and the technical sciences are well-known and important.
Examples of such applications are the harmonic functions in the theory of plane electrostatic ﬁelds
or plane ﬂows in Hydrodynamics and Aerodynamics. Furthermore, the biharmonic equation is used in
the solution of two-dimensional elasticity problems.
From a mathematical point of view the results of Complex Functions Theory imply that the investiga-
tion of many functions – including the most commonly used ones like the exponentials, the logarithms,
the trigonometric and the hyperbolic functions can be reduced to an investigation of their power series,
which locally can be approximated by polynomials.
A natural extension of the power series is given by the so-called Laurent series, in which we also allow
negative exponents. These are applied in sampling processes in Cybernetics, when we use the so-called
z-transform. The z-transform of a sequence just provides us with a very special Laurent series.
From a mathematical point of view the Laurent series give an unexpected bonus by leading to the
residue calculus. Using a standard technique, which will be given in the books, followed by an appli-
cation of the residue theorem it is possible to compute the exact value of many integrals and series,
a task which cannot be solved within the realm of the Real Calculus alone as given in the Ventus:
Calculus series. In order to ease matters in the computations, simple rules for calculating the residues
are given.
In this connection one should also mention the Laplace transform, because if the Laplace transformed
of a function exists in an open domain, then it is even analytic in this domain, and all the theorems of
these present books can be applied. It should be well-known that the Laplace transform is a must in
the technical sciences with lots of applications, like e.g. the transfer functions in Cybernetics and in
Circuit Theory. The reason for using the Laplace transform stems from the fact that “complicated”
operations like integration and diﬀerentiation are reduced to simpler algebraic operations. In this
connection it should be mentioned that the z-transform above may be considered as a discrete Laplace
transform, so it is no wonder why the z-transform and the Laplace transform have similar rules of
computation.
Complex Functions Theory is very often latently involved in the derivation of classical results. One
such example is Shannon’s theorem, or the sampling theorem, (originally proved in 1916 by Whittaker,
an English mathematician, much earlier than Shannon’s proof). We shall, however, not prove this
famous theorem, because a proof also requires some knowledge of Functional Analysis and of the
Fourier transform.
The examples of applications mentioned above are far from exhausting all possibilities, which are in
fact numerous. However, although Complex Functions Theory in many situation is a very powerful
means of solving speciﬁc problems, one must not believe that it can be used in all thinkable cases of
physical or technical setups. One obstacle is that it is a two-dimensional theory, while the real world is
three-dimensional. Another one is that analytic functions are not designed to give a direct description
of causality. In such cases one must always paraphrase the given problem in a more or less obvious
way. A third problem is exempliﬁed by low temperature Physics, where the existence of the absolute
zero at 0◦K implicitly has the impact that one cannot describe any non-constant process by analytic
functions in a small neighbourhood of this absolute zero. One should therefore be very content with
that there are indeed so many successful applications of Complex Functions Theory.

Introduction
Complex Functions Theory is here described in an a series and a c series. The c series gives a lot of
supplementary and more elaborated examples to the theory given in the a series, although there are
also some simpler examples in the a series. When reading a book in the a series the reader is therefore
recommended also to read the corresponding book in the c series. The present a series is divided into
three successive books, which will brieﬂy be described below.
a-1 The book Elementary Analytic Functions is deﬁning the battleﬁeld. It introduces the analytic
functions using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Furthermore, the powerful results of the Cauchy
Integral Theorem and the Cauchy Integral Formula are proved, and the most elementary analytic
functions are deﬁned and discussed as our building stones. The important applications of Cauchy’s
two results mentioned above are postponed to a-2.
a-2 The book Power Series is dealing with the correspondence between an analytic function and
its complex power series. We make a digression into the theory of Harmonic Functions, before
we continue with the Laurent series and the Residue Calculus.
A handful of simple rules for
computing the residues is given before we turn to the powerful applications of the residue calculus
in computing certain types of trigonometric integrals, improper integrals and the sum of some not
so simple series.
a-3 The book Transforms, Stability, Riemann surfaces, and Conformal maps starts with some trans-
forms, like the Laplace transform, the Mellin transform and the z-transform. Then we continue
with pointing out the connection between analytic functions and Geometry. We prove some clas-
sical criteria for stability in Cybernetics. Then we discuss the inverse of an analytic function and
the consequence of extending this to the so-called multi-valued functions. Finally, we give a short
review of the conformal maps and their importance for solving a Dirichlet problem.
The author is well aware of that the topics above only cover the most elementary parts of Complex
Functions Theory. The aim with this series has been hopefully to give the reader some knowledge of
the mathematical technique used in the most common technical applications.

The Complex Numbers
We shall in this chapter shortly review the complex numbers and related matters more or less known
from the elementary calculus. We shall use the following well-known notation:
• The set of natural numbers:
N = {1, 2, 3, . . . }
and
N0 = N ∪{0} = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }.
• The set of integers (i.e. Zahl in German),
Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . }.
• The set of ration numbers (i.e. quotients),
Q =
 p

.
• The set of real numbers, R.
• The set of complex numbers,
C = {z = x + iy | x, y ∈R}.

The Complex Numbers
1.1
Rectangular form of complex numbers
A complex number z ∈C is formally deﬁned as the sum
z = x + iy,
x, y ∈R,
where the symbol “i” is assumed to be a speciﬁc solution of the equation z2 = −1, so we adjoin one
root “i” of this equation to the ﬁeld R of real numbers to get the extended complex ﬁeld C. Thus
i2 := −1, which does not make sense in R.
Since C ∼R × R is two-dimensional, it is natural to identify C with the usual Euclidean plane, so
we let z = x + iy ∈C, x, y ∈R, geometrically be described by the point (x, y) ∈R × R with some
“strange” rule of multiplication given by the above i2 = −1. Due to this geometric interpretation we
also call C ∼R2 = R × R the complex plane.

Figure 1: The complex plane.
In the complex plane the real axis is identiﬁed with the X-axis, and the imaginary axis is identiﬁed
with the Y -axis. Points on the X-axis are identiﬁed with the usual real numbers, while points on
the Y -axis are called imaginary numbers. This unfortunate terminology stems from a time, when the
complex numbers were not clearly understood. It has ever since been customary to use word even for
the y-coordinate itself.
Given a complex number z = x + iy, x, y ∈R, it follows by the geometrical interpretation that the
real coordinates (x, y) are uniquely determined. We introduce the following fundamental notations,
cf. also Figure 1.
• x := ℜz = real part of z.
• y := ℑz = imaginary part of z.
• r := |z| =

x2 + y2 = absolute value (or module) of z.
• Θ = arg z = argument of z ̸= 0, i.e. the angle from the X-axis to the vector (x, y) ∈R2, modulo
2π.
• z := x −iy = complex conjugated of z, i.e. the reﬂection of z with respect to the real axis.

The Complex Numbers
Here the argument needs a comment, because the angle Θ is only determined modulo 2π. This means
that arg z is not a number, but a set (of numbers),
arg z = {Θ0 + 2pπ | p ∈Z} ,
z ̸= 0,
where Θ0 is any ﬁxed chosen angle between the X-axis and the vector of coordinates (x, y).
If z = 0, we deﬁne arg 0 := R.
Even if arg z is a set of numbers, it is the common practice sloppily to think of arg z as just one of its
many values. If one wants to be more precise, one may introduce the principal argument by
Arg z := Θ0 ∈] −π, π] ∩arg z,
z ̸= 0,
i.e. Arg z is the uniquely determined angle in the ﬁxed interval ] −π, π] of length 2π of the vector
(x, y) from the X-axis.
Another useful deﬁnition is
Arg0z := Θ0 ∈]0, 2π] ∩arg z,
z ̸= 0,
which is also uniquely determined, whenever z ̸= 0. This single-valued function Arg0z will be conve-
nient later on. For some strange reason it is not given a speciﬁc name.
Notice that the principal argument Arg : C \ {0} →] −π, π] is not deﬁned for z = 0.
We shall later see the importance of the multi-valued functions, of which arg z is our ﬁrst example.
The general principle is here that sets (or multi-valued functions) are written in lower-case letters, like
in arg z, while a derived single-valued function speciﬁed by some additional rule, in the chosen case
e.g. Arg z, starts with an upper-case letter. When this speciﬁcation of the singular-valued function
uses the principal argument in a more or less obvious way, we also call the result the principal value
of the underlying multi-valued function.
Remark 1.1.1 The reader should be aware of that some authors instead use the lower-case name for
the single-valued function and the upper-case name for the multi-valued function. We shall later on
meet other examples of diﬀerent notation in Complex Function Theory. ♦
The conjugation of a complex number, is geometrically interpreted as a reﬂection in the X-axis, cf.
Figure 1. If we deﬁne complex addition in C as the corresponding addition of vectors in R2 ∼C, then
it is easily seen that we have in the adopted notation,
z + z = 2x = 2ℜz,
z −z = 2iℑz,
z1 + z2 = z1 + z2.
We deﬁne the complex multiplication by adding the multiplication rules i · i = i2 = −1, already
mentioned earlier, and x · i = i · x = ix = xi for any x ∈R to the usual real multiplication. We
usually omit the dot · as the notation of multiplication and only use it occasionally for clarity. Here,
it = ti, t ∈R, is of course interpreted in the complex plane as the point on the imaginary axis with
the coordinates (0, t) ∈R2.
We note the important computation
(1) z · z = (x + iy)(x −iy) = x2 + y2 = |z|2 = r2 ≥0,
for all z ∈C.

The Complex Numbers
Example 1.1.1 A simple application of (1) is given by the computation of a quotient of two complex
numbers in order to ﬁnd the real and imaginary parts of the quotient. Consider the denominator
a+ib ̸= 0, a, b ∈R, and the numerator c+id, c, d ∈R. The trick is to multiply both the denominator
and the numerator by the conjugated of the denominator, which is ̸= 0. Thus
c + id
a + ib = c + id
a + ib · a −ib
a −ib = ac + bd
a2 + b2 + i ad −bc
a2 + b2 ,

In particular,

which can also be seen by the following simpler computation,

♦
Remark 1.1.2 Here we should give a warning. A common error in computing

z =

x + iy
is to believe that one can split by the + in the denominator, which will give us the wrong result,
1
x + 1
iy = 1
x −i 1
y ,
using that1
i = i
i2 = −i.
The frequency of students making this error is approximately once or twice per course, so it happens
more often than one would believe. That this result is indeed wrong is seen by comparing with the
right result (2). In fact, by identifying the real parts and the imaginary parts we get
x
x2 + y2 = 1
x
and
y
x2 + y2 = 1
y ,
(x, y) ̸= (0, 0),
from which
x2 = x2 + y2 = y2.
The only solution is x = y = 0, which is not possible, because we have assumed that (x, y) ̸= (0, 0). ♦

The Complex Numbers
It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the absolute value of z that |z| :=

x2 + y2 in the complex
plane can be interpreted as the Euclidean distance from 0 ∼(0, 0) to z ∼(x, y) (in the Euclidean
space). This implies that |z1 −z2| indicates the usual Euclidean distance between z1 ∼(x1, y1) and
z2 ∼(x2, y2) in the complex plane,
|z2 −z1| =

(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2.
Then it follows by elementary geometry (cf. Figure 2) that the triangle inequality holds, i.e.
|z3 −z1| ≤|z3 −z2| + |z2 −z1| ,
and that also
||z2| −|z1|| ≤|z2 ± z1| ≤|z2| + |z1| .

Remark 1.1.3 One should always use the notation z = x + iy introduced here, and avoid the “alter-
native” z = x + y√−1. The reason is that the square root, √·, is a multi-valued function, so √−1 is
not uniquely determined. All this will be explained later. That something is wrong, if we assume that
√−1 is single-valued, can be seen by noting that this would imply the following strange computation,
“1 =

which obviously is wrong. ♦
Remark 1.1.4 The notation “i” for the imaginary unit is due to Euler.
Unfortunately, “i” also
denotes the electric current in Circuit Theory, so one writes instead “j” for the imaginary unit. This
may cause some confusion. The situation is, however, even worse because one in some applied sciences
uses “j” for “-i”. One case is known of a university, where the scientists on the ground ﬂoor in one
particular building used the deﬁnition j := i, while the scientists (from another institute) on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor used j = −i instead! Therefore, in the applications the reader should always check which
deﬁnition of “j” has been used. ♦
1.2
Polar form of complex numbers
A complex number z = x + iy is uniquely determined by its absolute value r = |z| and anyone of its
arguments Θ ∈arg z. It follows by the Geometry that
x = ℜz = r · cos Θ
and
y = ℑz = r · sin Θ,
hence
(3) z = x + iy = r{cos Θ + i · sin Θ}.
This shows that the pair (r, Θ) is just the usual polar coordinates of the corresponding point in the
complex plane.
Consider two complex numbers z1, z2 ∈C, given by polar coordinates, i.e. according to (3),
z1 = r1 {cos Θ1 + i sin Θ1}
and
z2 = r2 {cos Θ2 + i sin Θ2} .

Figure 3: Polar coordinates of a complex number.
Thus, r1 = |z1| and Θ1 ∈arg z1, and similarly for z2. Then we get by the addition formulæ for cosine
and sine that
z1 · z2
=
r1 {cos Θ1 + i sin Θ1} · r2 {cos Θ2 + i sin Θ2}
=
r1r2 {(cos Θ1 cos Θ2 −sin Θ1 sin Θ2) + i (cos Θ1 sin Θ2 + sin Θ1 cos Θ2)}
=
r1r2 {cos (Θ1 + Θ2) + i sin (Θ1 + Θ2)} ,
from which follows that
(4) |z1z2| = r1r2 = |z1| · |z2|
and
Θ1 + Θ2 ∈arg (z1z2) .
Let in general A and B be two non-empty subsets of R or C. We deﬁne their sum by
A + B = {a + b | a ∈A, b ∈B}.
Since Θ1 ∈arg z1 and Θ2 ∈arg z2, it immediately follows from (4) by using the deﬁnition above that
arg z1 + arg z2 ⊆arg (z1z2) .
On the other hand, every argument in arg (z1z2) can in fact be found in this way.
We therefore
conclude that
(5) |z1z2| = |z1| · |z2|
and
arg (z1z2) = arg z1 + arg z2,
where the latter equation is a relation between sets.
Example 1.2.1 Formula (5) could lead to the wrong conclusion that e.g. arg

z2
is equal to 2·arg z.
This is not true if z ̸= 0. Let Θ ∈arg z be any argument of the complex number z ̸= 0. Then
arg

z2
= {2Θ + 2pπ | p ∈Z},
because the argument is always given modulo 2π.

The Complex Numbers
On the other hand,
2 · arg z = 2{Θ + 2pπ | p ∈Z} = {2Θ + 4pπ | p ∈Z},
so the factor 2 implies that the elements of 2 · arg z are given modulo 4π. Hence,
2 · z ⊂arg

and
2 · arg z ̸= arg

♦
Example 1.2.2 Notice that formula (5) holds for the argument, but not necessarily for the principal
argument. For the latter we must also require that
Arg z1 + Arg z2 ∈] −π, π],
which is not always the case.

An example in which (5) does not hold for the principal argument is given by z1 = z2 = −1 + i. Then

so Arg z1 + Arg z2 = 3π

/∈] −π, π],
and the sum is not a principal argument. We note that
(−1 + i)2 = −2i,
where Arg(−2i) = −π
2 = 3π
2 −2π.
♦
Formula (4) inspired mathematicians to introduce the following extremely useful deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 The complex exponential exp : C →C is deﬁned as the function
(6) exp z := ex{cos y + i sin y}
for z = x + iy,
x, y ∈R.
We see that if y = 0, this is just the usual real exponential, so Deﬁnition 1.2.1 is an extension of
the real exponential. We shall see that the complex exponential inherits the same properties as the
familiar real exponential has.

The Complex Numbers
Remark 1.2.1 Instead of exp z one often writes ez, although the latter in principal is not correct,
and it can formally lead to misunderstandings. The danger is, however, small, because one has become
used to consider ez as an exponential function (namely exp z) and not as a power function,, i.e. the
number e raised to the power z, which later on is proved to give quite a diﬀerent result. ♦
If we put x = 0 and y = Θ ∈R into (6), then we get another important formula, namely
(7) eiΘ = cos Θ + i sin Θ,
Θ ∈R.
This implies that a complex number z of the polar form (3) then can be written in the shorter form
(8) z = r · {cos Θ + i sin Θ} = r · eiΘ.
In particular, |z| = r = r
eiΘ, from which follows that
eiΘ = 1 for every Θ ∈R.
The diﬃcult computation of (4) now immediately gives the following result,
(9) z1 · z2 =

·

r2 eiΘ2
= r1r2 · ei(Θ1+Θ2),
and in particular,
eiΘ1 · eiΘ2 = ei(Θ1+Θ2),

The Complex Numbers
Combining this result with formula (6) we derive that the complex exponential satisﬁes precisely the
same functional equation
(10) exp (z1 + z2) = exp z1 · exp z2,
z1, z2 ∈C,
as the real exponential, so Deﬁnition 1.2.1 is an extremely fortunate extension of the real exponential.
Concerning the complex conjugation of exp z it follows from (6) that
exp z = ex{cos y + i sin y} = ex · {cos y −i sin y} = ex−iy = exp z,
so
exp z = exp z.
The polar coordinates are extremely useful, when we consider products, where rectangular coordinates
are more troublesome. In fact, if
z1 = x1 + iy1 = r1eiΘ1
and

then we get in polar coordinates that
z1 · z2 =

r2eiΘ2
= r1r2ei(Θ1+Θ2),
and for comparison in rectangular coordinates,
(11) z1 · z2 = {x1 + iy1} {x2 + iy2} = {x1x2 −y1y2} + i {x1y2 + x2y1} .
However, although (11) is more complicated than the formula of the product in polar coordinates, we
shall also need (11) in the following.
It should also be mentioned that rectangular coordinates are well suited for addition of complex
numbers, while the polar coordinates are almost hopeless in the case of addition.
The real hard
problems involve both rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates, because some operations are
more easy to apply in one type of coordinates then in the other and vice versa.
Let z = r eiΘ and n ∈N. It follows from the above that
zn = rneinΘ.

The Complex Numbers
Example 1.2.3 Formula (13) gives an easy way to express cos nΘ and sin nΘ by means of cos Θ
and sin Θ. We shall demonstrate this technique by putting n = 3 into (13). We get by the binomial
formula,
cos 3Θ + i sin 3Θ
=
{cos Θ + i sin Θ}3
=
cos3 Θ −3 cos Θ sin2 Θ + i

3 cos2 Θ sin Θ −sin3 Θ

.
Then split this identity into its real and imaginary parts to get
cos 3Θ = cos3 Θ −3 cos Θ sin2 Θ = 4 cos3 Θ −3 cos Θ,
sin 3Θ = 3 cos2 Θ sin Θ −sin3 Θ = 3 sin Θ −4 sin3 Θ,
where we have used that sin2 Θ = 1 −cos2 Θ and cos2 Θ = 1 −sin2 Θ in order to obtain the ﬁnal
expressions. ♦
Example 1.2.4 We have above developed several ways to compute a power of a complex number.
We shall now demonstrate that some of then give smaller computations than others. We shall compute
the complex number (1 + i)10 in various ways.
First method. Due to the very special structure of 1 + i the easiest way is here to apply a known
rule of computation,
(1 + i)10 =

(1 + i)25 = (2i)5 = 32i.
Second method. We shall here use polar coordinates. Since

in = 1 + 10i −45 −120i + 210 + 252i −210 −120i + 45 + 10i −1 = 32i.
Fourth method. The troublesome one. Use the formula (1 + i)n = (1 + i) · (1 + i)n−1 successively
to compute
1 + i, (1 + i)2, (1 + i)3, . . . , (1 + i)10 = 32i.
This is of course a very clumsy way of computation, although the result is again the right one,
namely 32i.
Fifth method. Apply a pocket calculator. In this simple example we shall of course again get the
right result, 32i.
However, the aim of the present books on Complex Functions Theory is as
long as possible to avoid approximate results, which pocket calculators and computers in general
will produce. The viewpoint is that since these devices exist, they should also be used, but only
when all other methods fail! In general one loses some information by using pocket calculators or
computers, which in some cases may be fatal. Therefore, this method should never be the ﬁrst
one to apply.

1.3
The binomial equation
We have seen above that we can use both rectangular and polar coordinates when we compute a
product or a quotient of complex numbers, and that polar coordinates in these cases are the most
convenient to use.
Concerning addition and subtraction one should, however, always use rectangular coordinates instead,
because polar coordinates in here usually give some very messy considerations. They will only be
applicable in very special cases.
We shall now turn to the problem of taking the nth root of a complex number. It will be demonstrated
in the following that in this case one should apply polar coordinates and only in extremely rare cases
use rectangular coordinates.

The Complex Numbers
In order to get started we mention without proof the following theorem:
Theorem 1.3.1 The fundamental theorem of algebra. If P(z) is a polynomial of degree ≥1,
then P(z) has at least one root.
We shall later give a couple of proofs of this theorem, but here we only take it for granted.
Using the fundamental theorem of algebra it is easy to prove the following
Corollary 1.3.1 Every polynomial P(z) of degree n has precisely n complex roots, when these are
counted by their multiplicity.
Proof. First note that the polynomial z−α of degree 1 has precisely one root, namely z = α (because
z −α ̸= 0 for z ̸= α). Furthermore, the polynomial z −α is a divisor in zm −αm for every m ∈N and
every α ∈R. In fact, it is easy to check by computing the right hand side, that
(15) zm −αm = (z −α)

zm−1 + αzm−2 + α2zm−3 + · · · + αm−2z + αm−1
,
and the claim follows.
Clearly, P(z) above is a linear combination of terms zm, m = 0, 1, . . . , n, so (15) implies that z −α
is a divisor in P(z) −P(α).

The Complex Numbers
To ease notation we write P(z) = Pn(z) to indicate that Pn(z) is of degree n. When n ≥1, then the
fundamental theorem of algebra tells us that Pn(z) has (at least) one root α1, so Pn (α1) = 0. This
implies also that z −α1 is a divisor in
Pn(z) −Pn (α1) = Pn(z),
(because Pn (α1) = 0)
Hence there is a polynomial Pn−1(z) of degree n −1, such that
Pn(z) = (z −α1) Pn−1(z).
If n = 1, then Pn−1(z) ̸= 0 is a constant, and α1 is the only root.
If n > 1, we repeat the process above on Pn−1(z), which has a root α2, so
Pn(z) = (z −α1) Pn−1(z) = (z −α1) (z −α2) Pn−2(z).
This process can be repeated n times, giving
Pn(z) = (z −α1) (z −α2) · · · (z −αn) · P0(z),
where P0(z) ̸= 0 is a constant (a nontrivial polynomial of degree zero).
Some of the αj may be
identical, but this does not change the fact that the roots of Pn(z) are precisely the n numbers
α1, . . . , αn. □
Using Corollary 1.3.1 it is easy to prove the following theorem on the binomial equation.
Theorem 1.3.2 Given a = r eiΘ ̸= 0 in polar coordinates. The binomial equation (i.e. there are only
two terms in this equation)
zn = a = r eiΘ,
has its n (diﬀerent) roots given by

for p = 0, 1, . . . , n −1.
Proof. It follows by insertion that anyone of the n complex numbers, given by (16) is a solution.
The polynomial zn −a has degree n, so it suﬃces to prove that the n numbers of (16) are mutually
diﬀerent from each other. Using the module and the principal argument we get
|z| =
n
|a| > 0
and
Arg z ∈1
n · arg z =

.
There are precisely n numbers in the set 1
n · arg a ∩] −π, π], so the principal argument Arg z has
precisely n mutually diﬀerent values. This means that the n roots in (16) are also mutually diﬀerent,
and the theorem is proved. □
The geometrical interpretation of (16) is that the n solutions of a binomial equation zn = a ̸= 0 all
lie on a circle of radius
n
|a| and centre 0 and that they form a regular polygon of n vertices (the
roots in the complex plane). This implies that if we have found just one root, then it is easy, using
Geometry, to ﬁnd the other roots.

Figure 6: The roots of a binomial equation z6 = a form a regular polygon of 6 vertices.
The easiest way to remember formula (16) is to use the complex exponential. In fact, since

we have

also be written
zn = (z −0)(z −0) · · · (z −0) = (z −0)n = 0.

Remark 1.3.1 From the values above one could easily jump to the wrong conclusion that cos π
n and
sin π
n can always be expressed by square roots. This is not the case! It can be proved for n ≤20 that
this is only possible for
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20,
(n ≤20),
and it is not possible for
n = 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19,
(n ≤20).
This question is connected with the classical problem of when a regular polygon of n vertices can be
constructed by means of ruler and compass. Without proof we mention that this can only be done, if
n has the following structure,
n = 2q · p1 · · · pk,
where q ∈N0, and where p1, . . . , pk are pairwise mutually diﬀerent primes of the very special structure
22m + 1. Only very few primes of this structure are known,
3,
5,
17,
257,
65, 537.
One does not know if there are any other than the ﬁve mentioned primes above.

According to folklore there exists in the archives of the University of G¨ottingen a paper, in which an
amateur mathematician once constructed a regular polygon of 257 vertices with ruler and compass,
so it can be done. The author has only experienced the construction of regular polygons of 3 (easy),
5 (at high school) and 17 vertices (at university). The more elaborated constructions, i.e. for at least
n = 5, are of course curia and not of practical use.

1.4
The general equation Az2 + Bz + C = 0 of second degree
We shall ﬁnd the formula of the roots of a general complex polynomial Az2 + Bz + C of degree 2,
where A ∈C \ {0} and B, C ∈C, and we shall show that it is formally identical with the well-known
solution formula when the coeﬃcients are real.
The diﬀerence from the real case is the the real square root
√· : R+ ∪{0} →R+ ∪{0}
is uniquely determined by the requirement that both the domain and the range are R+ ∪{0}.
On the other hand, the complex square root √· : C →C is deﬁned as a so-called 2-valued function,
where √a is a shorthand for the set of both solutions of the binomial equation z2 = 1 of degree 2.
Theorem 1.4.1 Let A ∈C \ {0}, and B, C ∈C be complex constants. The solutions of the equation
of second degree
(19) Az2 + Bz + C = 0
is given by
(20) z = −B ±
√
B2 −4AC
2A
,
where we choose anyone of the the two possible values of
√
B2 −4AC in (20).
Proof.
The simple, though tedious proof is to insert (20) into (19), thus checking that we have
obtained the solutions. Notice that when
√
B2 −4AC = 0, then (20) gives a root of multiple 2.
A more elegant way is the well-known derivation of (20) from (19).
Multiply (19) by 4A ̸= 0, and then add B2 −4AC. This gives the equivalent equation of the same
roots,
B2 −4AC
=

4A2z2 + 4ABz + 4AC

+ B2 −4AC
=
{2Az}2 + 2 · 2Az · B + B2 = {2Az + B}2.
Therefore, if we put w = 2Az + B, then solving (19) is equivalent to solving the binomial equation
w2 = {2Az + B}2 = B2 −4AC.
If we choose
√
B2 −4AC as any of its two possible values, then
w = 2Az + B = ±

B2 −4AC,
from which (20) easily follows. □
Remark 1.4.1 At this early stage of the description we have been forced to make some strange
manoeuvres in order to tackle the complex square root. We shall later return to this problem and
ease the matters. ♦

The equations of third and fourth degree
It is possible also to ﬁnd exact solution formulæ of the general equations
Az3 + Bz2 + Cz + D = 0
of third degree,
Az4 + Bz3 + Cz2 + Dz + E = 0
of fourth degree,
but they are not so useful in practice as the solution formula (20) of the equation of second degree
(19), so they are very rarely included in the syllabus.
For completeness and for historical reasons we include these solution procedures in this section. The
reader is, however, warned not to use them, unless it is explicitly required.
We shall start with a small historical excursion.
The ﬁrst time such solution formulæ are mentioned is in Ars Magna, Nuremberg 1549. Here Girolamo
Cardano (1501–1576) writes in a paper that Scipio del Ferro discovered about 1515 a method to solve
an equation of the type
x3 + px = q.
This was later on not denied by Nicolo Tartaglia, though he claims that he independently of del Ferro
had found another method of solving a similar equation,
x3 + px2 = q.
Although Cardano did not ﬁnd the solution himself and never claimed that he had done it, his
description became the most popular, so the formula has ever since been known as Cardano’s formula.
It was obviously diﬃcult in those days to write mathematical equations, because the present formalism
had not yet been invented. In the chapter “De cubo & rebus æqualibus numerus” of Ars Magna,
Cardano is solving the equation
cubs p; 6 rebs æqlis 20,
which translated into the modern terminology is the same as
x3 + 6x = 20.
The solution of the equation of fourth degree is due to Ferrari, and it was also published by Cardano
in Ars Magna.
For a long time it was an unsolved problem if one could ﬁnd general solution formulæ for equations of
higher degree. That problem was ﬁnally solved by Evariste Galois (1811–1832). Born in Paris, Galois
was a devoted republican, and he was twice in prison for political reasons. He tried twice to enter
´Ecole Polytechnique, but failed. Finally, he succeeded in getting into ´Ecole Normale. Nevertheless he
founded (in letters to his friends) that branch of Algebra, which today is called Galois Theory, named
after him.
Unfortunately he died too young in a duel over a loose woman. Some people have believed that he
was lured by his political enemies into this duel, but recent historical investigations seem instead to
believe that the duel was purely emotional. Quite dramatically in this context he wrote the night

before the duel a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier, in which he sketched his discovery of the
connection between Group Theory and the solution of equations of degree n by means of roots, and
he concluded that no general solution formula existed for n ≥5. Of course, this does not mean that
no equation of degree ≥5 can be solved. Some of them can, but not all of them.
The equation of third degree.
We consider the equation
x3 + a1x2 + a2x + a3 = 0.
Using the substitution x = y −1
3 a1, this equation is transferred into the equivalent equation
y3 + py + q = 0,
where
p = −1
3 a2
1 + a2
and
q = 2
27 a3
1 −1
3 a1a2 + a3.
If we put y = u + v, then
(21) u3 + v3 + (3uv + p)(u + v) + q = 0.
For each given y we choose the variables u and v, such that
y = u + v
and
−p
3 = uv.
This means that u and v are the roots of the equation of second degree,
z2 −yz −p
3 = 0.
Finally, note that if uv = −p
3, then (21) reduces to u3 + v3 = −q. Hence, we have proved
Theorem 1.5.1 A complex number y ∈C is a root of the special equation of third degree
y3 + py + q = 0,
if and only if it can be written in the form y = u + v, where u and v satisfy the equations
(22) u3 + v3 = −q
and
uv = −p
3.
The two equations of (22) imply (though they are not equivalent to)
u3 + v3 = −q
and
u3v3 = −1
27 p3.
From the general
(z −α)(z −β) = z2 −{α + β}z + αβ = z2 + a1z + a2 = 0
follows that the sum of the roots is equal to −a1 and the product of the roots is a2. Therefore, we
have in the present case that u3 and v3 are the roots of the following equation of second degree
z2 + qz −1
27 p3 = 0.

The equation of fourth degree.
We consider the equation
x4 + a1x3 + a2x2 + a3x + a4 = 0
of fourth degree. Using the substitution x = y −a1/4 it is transformed into
(23) y4 + py2 + qy + r = 0,
where one with some eﬀort can ﬁnd p, q and r expressed by the coeﬃcients a1, a2, a3 and a4.
The simplest case is when q = 0, because then
y4 + py2 + r =

y22 + p · y2 + r = 0
can be considered as an equation of second degree in y2, and the four solutions are easily found.
Then assume that q ̸= 0, and let z ∈C be any complex number. Then we can transform (23) into
(24)

y2 + z
2 −

(2z −p)y2 −qy + z2 −r

= 0.
The nasty trick is to choose z as a solution of the equation
(25) 4(2z −p)

z2 −r

−q2 = 0
of third degree, using the method described previously!
It follows from q ̸= 0 that also 2z −p ̸= 0, hence
(26) (2z −p)y2 −qy + z2 −r = (ay + b)2,
where
(27) a =

2z −p
and
b = −q
2a.
By insertion of (26) into (24) we get of course

y2 + z
2 = (ay + b)2,
or

y2 + z
2 −(ay + b)2 =

y2 + z + ay + b
 
y2 + z −ay −b

= 0.
Thus, we have proved [cf. also (25)–(27) above],
Theorem 1.5.3 The four solutions of the equation
y4 + py2 + qy + r = 0,
q ̸= 0,
are the same as the four solutions of the two equations of second degree
y2 + ay + z + b = 0
and
y2 −ay + z −b = 0,
where z is any ﬁxed solution of the equation
4(2z −p)

z2 −r

−q2 = 0,
and where
a =

2z −p
and
b = −q

Clearly, Theorem 1.5.3 demonstrates that even if it is possible to ﬁnd the exact solutions of an equation
of fourth degree, the solution procedure and the results are so complicated that no sane person would
use it as a standard procedure.

Rational roots and multiple roots of a polynomial
In the applications the polynomials are very important functions. Therefore, it must also be important
to ﬁnd the roots of a given polynomial. For the time being we have only the result of the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra which tells us that a polynomial of degree n has precisely n roots, counted by
multiplicity. However, ﬁnding these roots may be far more diﬃcult than one would expect. This is an
important issue, but at this stage we can only produce the simplest procedures, which may or may
not give us some of the roots.
We shall start with the well-known method of ﬁnding rational roots in a polynomial of integer coeﬃ-
cients. First we introduce the following notation.
Let p ∈N and a ∈Z be integers. If p ̸= 0 is divisor in a, i.e. there is a b ∈Z, such that a = p · b, then
we write p|a.
Theorem 1.6.1 Let
(28) a0zn + a1zn−1 + · · · + an−1z + an = 0
be a polynomial of integer coeﬃcients, a0, a1, . . . , an ∈Z. If (28) has a rational root p
q ∈Q, where
q is not divisor in p, then
p|an
and
q|a0.
Proof. Put z = p
q ∈Q into (28) and multiply by qn,
a0pn + a1pn−1q + a2pn−2q2n + · · · an−1pqn−1 + anqn
= a0pn + q

a1pn−1 + · · · + anqn−1
= p

a0pn−1 + · · · + an−1qn−1
+ anqn.
All numbers are integers, so if p
q is a root, this expression is 0, which is only possible, if
q|a0pn
i.e.
q|a0
and
p|anqn
i.e.
p|an.
□
Notice that Theorem 1.6.1 does not assure that a given polynomial of integer coeﬃcients indeed has
a rational root. The polynomial P(z) = z2 + z + 1 has integer coeﬃcients, so p = ±1 and q = 1, and
z = ±1 are the only possible rational roots. A simple check shows that
P(1) = 3 ̸= 0
and
P(−1) = 1 ̸= 0,
so P(z) does not have rational roots. Using the solution formula for equations of second degree we
ﬁnd that the roots are the complex conjugated

Procedure of ﬁnding rational roots.
1) Check that the polynomial (28) has (real) integer coeﬃcients a0, a1, . . . , an ∈Z, a0 ̸= 0.
2) Find all possible positive divisors of a0 (the set Q).
3) Find all possible positive and negative divisors of an (the set P).
4) Check all possible rational roots, i.e. the elements of

Example 1.6.1 We shall ﬁnd the four roots of the polynomial
P4(z) = 6z4 −5z3 + 3z2 + 3z −2
of degree four and of integer coeﬃcients, by ﬁrst ﬁnding all the possible rational roots.
It follows from a0 = 6 and a4 = −2 that if p
q ∈Q is a rational root, then
p ∈{±1, ±2}
and
q ∈{1, 2, 3, 6}.

where we have used the usual solution formula for the equation z2 −z + 1 = 0 of degree 2. ♦
We now turn to the problem of ﬁnding possible multiple roots. Here we shall use the following simple
theorem.
Theorem 1.6.2 Given a general polynomial P(z) of complex coeﬃcients.
If a ∈C is a root of
multiplicity k ≥2 in P(z), then a ∈C is a root of multiplicity k −1 ≥1 in P ′(z).
Proof. We have not yet formally deﬁned complex diﬀerentiation, so we shall here take for granted
that e.g.
dzk
dz = k zk−1,
so P ′(z) is derived from P(z) as if P(z) was a real polynomial. We shall of course later prove this
claim.
Let a ∈C be a root of multiplicity k ≥2 in P(z). Then
P(z) = (z −a)kQ(z),
where Q(z) is also a polynomial, so
P ′(z) = k(z −a)k−1Q(z) + (z −a)kQ′(z) = (z −a)k−1 ˜Q(z),
where ˜Q(z) = k · Q(z) + (z −a)Q′(z) again is a polynomial. Clearly, (z −a)k−1 is a divisor in both
P(z) and in P ′(z). □
Procedure of ﬁnding multiple roots.
We assume that P(z) has a root a ∈C of multiplicity
k ≥2. It follows from Theorem 1.6.2 that (z −a)k−1 is a divisor in both P(z) and P ′(z). Then by a
division,
P(z) = Q0(z) · P ′(z) + R1(z),
where Q0(z) is a polynomial of degree 1, and the remainder term R1(z) is a polynomial of degree
≤k −2. We get by a rearrangement,
R1(z) = P(z) −Q0(z) · P ′(z).
Since (z −a)k−1 is a divisor on the right hand side, we also have that it is a divisor in R1(z).

Elementary Analytic Functions
36 
The Complex Numbers
In the next step we ﬁnd polynomials Q1(z) and R2(z), such that
P ′(z) = Q1(z) · R1(z) + R2(z),
where the degree of R2(z) is smaller than the degree of R1(z).
In the next step we compute
R1(z) = Q2(z)R2(z) + R3(z),
etc.. Since the degrees of the remainder terms Rk(z) are decreasing, we must have Rj+1(z) = 0 after
a ﬁnal number of steps. Then the roots of Rj(z) are all the multiple roots of P(z). We have more
precisely:
If
(29) P(z) = A · (z −a1)k1 · · · (z −an)kn ,
then
(30) Rj(z) = B · (z −a1)k1−1 · · · (z −an)kn−1 .
Notice that if some kℓ= 1, then the factor (z −aℓ)kj−1 = 1 in (34).
Usually the process stops here, but in some cases one may get more information in the following way:
1) Clearly, when we divide (29) by (30), then we get
P(z)
Rj(z) = A
B (z −a1) · · · (z −an) ,
i.e. a polynomial having all the same roots as P(z), only as simple roots.
2) Another possibility is to repeat the method on Rj(z) we can also isolate the roots of multiplicity
≥3, etc..
Example 1.6.2 Given the existence of some multiple root, ﬁnd all the roots of the polynomial of
complex complex coeﬃcients,
P(z) = z3 −(1 + 2i)z2 −(1 −2i)z + 1.
A formal diﬀerentiation gives
P ′(z) = 3z2 −(2 + 4i)z −(1 −2i),
and it is not hard by division to ﬁnd that
P(z) =
1
3 z −1 + 2i
9

P ′(z) + 4
9 i z + 4
9 =
1
3 z −1 + 2i
9

P ′(z) + 4
9 i(z −i).
The only possible multiple root (in fact of multiplicity 2) is z = i. Instead of continuing the procedure
as described above we simple check it by dividing P(z) by (z −i)2 = z −2iz −1. This gives
P(z) = z3 −(1 + 2i)z2 −(1 −2i)z + 1 = (z −1)(z −i)2,
and z = i is indeed a root of multiplicity 2. The remainder single root is z = 1. ♦

Symbolic currents and voltages. Time vectors.
In this section we show that we already at this early stage of the theory have some useful applications
of complex functions and numbers in some technical sciences.
In the theory of oscillations in electric circuits one considers periodic functions of some period T, i.e.
f(t) = f(t + nT)
for all n ∈Z.
such functions are usually described by a Fourier series, i.e.
(31) f(t) ∼1

where the symbol ∼means that the trigonometric series on the right hand side may not be pointwise
equal to f(t), but it nevertheless in some sense describes most of the properties of f(t).
Clearly, the basic oscillations of (31) are either cos

or sin

, meaning that it suﬃces to use only the cosine function. With abuse of the language we
deﬁne e.g. a sine shaped oscillating voltage, or just a sine shaped voltage, by
(32) v(t) = va cos(ωt + ϕ),
where the constant va > 0 is called the amplitude, and the constant ω > 0 the angular speed, while
the constant ϕ ∈R is called the phase angle. Finally, the increasing function ωt + ϕ of t is called the
phase function.

The Complex Numbers
Analogously we deﬁne a sine shaped current by
(33) I(t) = ia cos(ωt + ϕ),
which is completely characterized by the constants ia > 0, the amplitude, ω > 0, i.e. its angular speed,
and ϕ ∈R, its phase angle.
Then note that (33) can also be written
(34) I(t) = ia ℜ

ei(ωt+ϕ)
= ia ℜ

eiϕ · eiωt
.
Given ω > 0, we see that we can represent I(t) by the complex number (and not a function)
(35) I = ia eiϕ.
In Circuit Theory, this constant I is called the symbolic current.
Analogously we use (32) to deﬁne the symbolic voltage V ∈C as the complex number
(36) V = va eiϕ.
On the other hand, given e.g. the symbolic current I ∈C, then the corresponding sine shaped current
is easily reconstructed by the formula
(37) I(t) = ℜ

I · eiωt
,
and analogously for the symbolic voltage.
The advantage of this notation is demonstrated by the following. Consider two sine shaped currents
of the same angular speed. Let their corresponding symbolic currents be I1, I2 ∈C. Using (37) we
get concerning their sum,
I(t) = I1(t) + I2(t) = ℜ

I1eiωt
+ ℜ

I2eiωt
= ℜ

(I1 + I2) eiωt
,
from which follows that the symbolic current I of I(t) is
(38) I = I1 + I2.
Therefore, keeping the angular speed ﬁxed, we can add sine shaped currents just by adding their
corresponding symbolic currents.
Sometimes symbolic currents and symbolic voltages are called time vectors (representing vectors in
the complex plane).
We can get more out of this idea, always assuming that the angular speed ω > 0 is kept ﬁxed. Let
I(t) be given by (33), i.e.
I(t) = ia cos(ωt + ϕ)
and
I = ia eiϕ.
Let a dot above a letter denote a diﬀerentiation with respect to the real time variable t. Then
˙I(t) = dI
dt = −ia ω sin(ωt + ϕ) = ℜ

The Complex Numbers
so the symbolic current of ˙I(t) is given by
(39) ˙I = iω · ia eiϕ = iωI.
Similarly, we have ˙V = iωV for the symbolic voltages.
Let the stationary current I(t), given by (33), run through a circuit consisting of a resistance R,
an inductance L, and a capacitance C.
Then we get from the well-known left column below the
corresponding symbolic voltages in the right column,
VR(t) = RI(t),
VR = RI,
VL(t) = L ˙I(t),
VL = iωLI,
VC(t) = 1

I(t) dt,
VC =

iωC I.
The equations in the right column are called the symbolic elementary relations. They are all algebraic
equations between complex numbers as Ohm’s law, V = Z · I, where we call
ZR = R,
ZL = iωL,
ZC =
1
iωC ,
the elementary impedances. The reciprocal numbers,
YR = 1
R,
YL =
1
iωL,
YC = iωC,
are called the elementary admittances.
This small review of Elementary Circuit Theory shows that even at this early stage of the Complex
Functions Theory one may save a lot of time in the computations and obtain more clarity by using
symbolic currents and voltages instead of the full expressions (33) and (32) of the current and the
voltage.

Basic Topology and Complex Functions
2.1
Basic Topology
In this section we collect all the necessary results from topology. Readers already familiar with these
ideas may skip this section and proceed directly to the next section, in which the complex functions are
introduced. Nevertheless, it is felt to be quite convenient to have all these abstract concepts collected
somewhere in this series, as they form the theoretical basis of Calculus and Mathematical Analysis.
The motivation is the idea of a continuous function. Let us for the time being consider a real function
f : R →R. It is well-known that f is continuous at a point x0 ∈R, if one to every ε > 0 can ﬁnd a
δ = δ(ε) > 0, depending on ε, such that
(40) if |x −x0| < δ,
then |f(x) −f (x0)| < ε.
In other words (and roughly speaking): “If x lies close to x0, then the image f(x) lies close to f (x0)”,
where the later closeness in some way is governed by the former one.

Figure 8: Geometrical description of a continuous complex function f : C →C from the complex z
plane into the complex w plane.
The deﬁnition above is immediately extended to functions f : Ω→C, where Ω⊆C. Here we may
consider C as equivalent to R2 with z = x + iy ∈C corresponding to (x, y) ∈R2. There is nothing
mysterious in this, because the complex plane C has been given the same geometry as the Euclidean
space E2 = R2. We see that the deﬁnition (40) in this extended case in words should be written in
the following way:
Given a nonempty set Ω⊆C. A function f : Ω→C is continuous at a point z0 ∈Ω, if one to
every ε > 0 can ﬁnd a δ = δ(ε) > 0, such that
• if z ∈Ω, and the distance from z0 to z is smaller than δ, i.e. |z −z0| < δ, then the distance
between the images by f is smaller than ε, i.e. |f(z) −f (z0)| < ε.
The geometry of Figure 7 shows that it is natural to describe continuity by means of discs.
By the open disc of centre z0 ∈C and radius r > 0 we shall understand the set
(41) B (z0, r) = {z ∈C | |z −z0| < r} .

Basic Topology and Complex Functions
This set is indeed described by a disc in Figure 7.
It follows that f : Ω→C is continuous at a point z0 ∈Ωif to any ε > 0 there exists a δ = δ(ε) > 0,
such that we for all z ∈B (z0, δ) ∩Ωhave that f(z) ∈B (f (z0) , ε).
For clearness and in order to save space, statements like this were ﬁfty years ago only described by
using quantiﬁers in the following way,
(42) ∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 ∀z ∈B (z0, δ) ∩Ω: f(z) ∈B (f (z0) , ε) ,
leaving the geometrical interpretation to the reader. However, most people felt that (42) was diﬃcult
to read, so there has ever since been a tendency also to give the description in words and on a
ﬁgure. We shall here let the use of quantiﬁers ∀(= for all) and ∃(= there exists) signal that we are
dealing with some results, which are fundamental for the theoretical stuﬀ, but not so important for
the applications, if we believe in the theorems and formulæ.
We shall later os also need closed discs of centre z0 ∈C and radius r > 0. These are deﬁned by
B [z0, r] = {z ∈C | |z −z0| ≤r} ,
so ordinary brackets are used for open discs, while square brackets are used for closed discs.

It was early in the twentieth century realized that the system of open discs was too rigid for the
mathematical applications. Instead one introduced
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 A set Ω⊆C is said to be open, if there to every z0 ∈Ωexists an r > 0, such that
B (z0, r) ⊆Ω, i.e. if B (z0, r) is a subset of Ω.
We say that a set A ⊆C is closed, if its complementary set ∁A is open.
Topology of open sets.
We say that a system O of subsets of C is a topology, and its elements are called open sets, if O satisﬁes
the following three conditions:
1) C ∈O and ∅∈O.
2) If {Ωj | j ∈I} is any system of open sets, then

j∈I
Ωj ∈O.
3) If {Ωj | j = 1, . . . , n} is a ﬁnite system of open sets, then
n

j=1
Ωj ∈O.
Remark 2.1.1 It is easy to check that the system O of all sets in Deﬁnition 2.1.1 indeed satisﬁes the
three conditions above, so the two deﬁnitions are consistent.
One should note that the empty set, ∅, is open of formal reasons, because the condition reads: For
every z0 ∈∅, etc. and there is no point z0 ∈∅.
Note also that an inﬁnite intersection of open sets may not be open. A simple example in R is the
closed interval

Remark 2.1.2 The three condition above deﬁning a topology cannot be reduced further, if one wants
to deﬁne concepts like continuity. They are not dependent on a given metric which does not have
always to exist in a topological space. However, in the present cases of R and C it would of course be
stupid not to use the natural distance as deﬁning the topology as above.
The word topology comes from Greek: τ ´oπoς = place, and λ´oγoς = word, thought. ♦

The system F = {A \ Ω| Ω∈OA} is called the system of closed sets in the given topology OA.
Although it may at the ﬁrst glance seem to be very abstract to use open sets instead of distances, it
is in many cases more convenient to do so.
We ﬁrst deﬁne the inverse map, or just the inverse, of a function f : Ω→C. Let D(A) denote the
family of all possible subsets of the set A. Then the inverse f ◦−1 : D(C) →D(Ω) is given by
f ◦−1(A) := {z ∈Ω| f(z) ∈A} ⊆Ω,
A ∈D(C).
In particular, if A ∩f(Ω) = ∅, then of course f ◦−1(A) = ∅.
Now we can give a more elegant deﬁnition of continuity.
Deﬁnition 2.1.2 Let Ωbe an open and non-empty subset of C, and let f : Ω→C be a function.
Then f is continuous in Ω(i.e. continuous at every point of Ω) if
f ◦−1(ω) ∈OΩ
for every ω ∈OC,
i.e. the inverse by f of every open set is again open.
We must of course check that Deﬁnition 2.1.2 is consistent with the previous one given by (40).
Proof. Let Ωbe open, and let f : Ω→C be continuous in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1.2. We shall
prove that it is continuous at every point z0 ∈Ωin the sense of (40), or – written by quantiﬁers – we
shall prove that
(43) ∀z0 ∈Ω∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 ∀z ∈Ω: |z −z0| < δ ⇒|f(z) −f (z0)| < ε.
Assume that z0 ∈Ωand ε > 0 have been chosen arbitrarily. According to (43) we shall consider the
open set
ω = B (f (z0) , ε) .
This set is open, so f ◦−1(ω) is open by Deﬁnition 2.1.2. Furthermore, z0 ∈f ◦−1(ω), so by Deﬁni-
tion 2.1.1 there is a δ > 0, such that
B (z0, δ) ⊆f ◦−1(ω).
This implies that if z ∈B (z0, δ), i.e. |z −z0| < δ, then f(z) ∈ω = B (f (z0) , ε), i.e. |f(z) −f (z0)| < ε.
This is true for every z0 ∈Ωand every ε > 0, so the claim is proved. □.
Remark 2.1.3 Conversely, it is possible to prove that (43) also implies Deﬁnition 2.1.2, so the two def-
initions are equivalent. Condition (43) is most useful i n explicit computations, while Deﬁnition 2.1.2
is far the best one to use in theoretical consideration, so the two deﬁnitions are supplementary to each
other. ♦

Theorem 2.1.1 Let Ωand ω be two open and nonempty subsets of C, and let f : Ω→ω and
g : ω →C be two continuous maps. Then the composition g ◦f : Ω→C is also continuous.
Proof. This proof really demonstrates the power of Deﬁnition 2.1.2, where an application of the
equivalent (43) would become very messy in comparison.
We shall prove that if A ∈O is any open subset of C, then (f ◦g)◦−1(A) ∈O is also open.
However, g : ω →C is continuous, hence g◦−1(A) ⊆ω is open in ω, and f : Ω→ω is continuous, so
f ◦−1 
g◦−1(A)

is open, and the theorem is proved. □
Compact sets.
The following deﬁnitions may also at a ﬁrst glance seem rather abstract with no connection with the
topic of this book, but a closer look will show that its consequences are indeed fundamental.
Deﬁnition 2.1.3 Given any A ⊆C. By an open covering of A we understand a system
C = {Ωj | j ∈I}
of open sets, such that
A ⊆

j∈I
Ωj.
An open covering C is called ﬁnite, if the index set I = {1, . . . , n} is ﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 2.1.4 A set A ⊆C is called compact, if every open covering of A contains a ﬁnite
covering.
First we prove the following important consequence, which also gives a better understanding of com-
pactness.
Theorem 2.1.2 A set A ⊆C is compact, if and only if it is closed and bounded.
Remark 2.1.4 Theorem 2.1.2 says that concerning compactness in C we might as well just check if
the given set is closed and bounded. However, in the mathematical proofs it is usually much easier to
use Deﬁnition 2.1.4 instead of Theorem 2.1.2. Here it should also be mentioned that there exist more
general topological spaces in which being closed and bounded is not the same as being compact. ♦
Proof. First assume that A is compact in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1.4. Clearly, {B(z, 1) | z ∈A} is
an open covering of A, so it contains a ﬁnite covering
A ⊆
n

j=1

Then assume that A is not closed. We shall prove that A is not compact.
Let ¯A denote the closure of A, i.e. ¯A ⊇A is the smallest closed set containing A. By assumption,
there is a point z0 ∈¯A \ A, so we can ﬁnd a sequence (zn) ⊆A, such that
|z0 −zn| < 1
n
for all n ∈N.
Note that all zn ∈A, while z0 /∈A. Then clearly,

z ∈C
 |z −z0| > 1
n
  n ∈N

is an open covering of A, which does not contain a ﬁnite covering, so A is not compact. We get by
contraposition that if A is compact, then A is also closed.
We have now proved the easy part, namely that if A is compact, then A is closed and bounded.
Let us turn to the rather complicated proof of the claim that in the special case of C ∼R2 a bounded
and closed set is also compact.
Assume that A is bounded and closed. Let C = {Ωj | j ∈J} be any open covering of A. Each Ωj is
open, so to every z ∈Ωj there is an rz,j > 0, such that
B (z, rz,j) ⊆Ωj.
Clearly,
B = {B (z, rz,j) | z ∈Ωj, j ∈J}
is also an open covering of A, because each z ∈A already belongs to some Ωj. The claim is proved if
B contains a ﬁnite covering, because then (where we change the indices conveniently)
A ⊆
n

j=1
B (z, rz,j) ⊆
n

n=1
Ωj.
Thus, it suﬃces to prove that every covering of A by open discs of the type A = {B (z, rz) | z ∈A}
contains a ﬁnite covering, so we assume that we are given such a system A in the following.
First choose z1 ∈A, such that
r1 := rz1 ≥1
2 sup {rz | z ∈A} .
If A ⊆B (z1, r1), then the claim follows. Hence, we assume that A \ B (z1, r1) ̸= ∅.
Then choose z2 ∈A \ B (z1, r1), such that
r2 := rz2 ≥1
2 sup {rz | A \ B (z1, r1)} .
Proceed in this way, so in the nth step we choose a point

and we have found a ﬁnite covering.
Assuming that A is closed and bounded (in C) we shall prove that this process always stops after a
ﬁnite number of steps. This is done contrariwise, so we assume that the process never stops. This
implies that we by this process have selected an inﬁnite sequence (zn) by using (44). We shall prove
that this assumption nevertheless will contradict (44), which means that the process will always stop
after a ﬁnite number of steps, and the theorem will be proved.

Figure 9: Construction of an accumulation point by a decreasing sequence of closed squares in C ∼R2.
The set A was assumed bounded, so A is contained in a bounded square as in Figure 9, and all the
inﬁnite numbers zn are lying in this square. We divide the square into four squares of half the edge
length. At least one of these must also contain inﬁnite many of the numbers zn. Choose anyone of
the smaller square having this property.
Then divide the chosen square into four smaller squares and choose one of these, which again contain
inﬁnitely many of the points zn.
Proceed in this way, in each step halving the edge length and choosing a square, which contains
inﬁnitely many of the zn.
We conclude from the geometry of this construction that every countable sequence (zn) on a bounded
set has at least one accumulation point (also called a cluster point by some authors).
Let z⋆be an accumulation point of the sequence (zn). This means that no matter how small ε > 0 is
chosen, the open disc B (z⋆, ε) will always contain inﬁnitely many of the elements zn. We shall prove
that z⋆∈A.

Contrariwise. Assume that z⋆/∈A, i.e. z⋆∈∁A, which is open, because A is closed. Then there is an
ε > 0, such that
B (z⋆, ε) ⊆∁A,
i.e
B (z⋆, ε) ∩A = ∅,
which is not possible. Hence, z⋆∈A.
Then we shall prove that z⋆̸= zn for all n ∈N.
Contrariwise. If z⋆= zm for some m ∈N, then zn /∈B (zm, rm) for all n > m, from which follows
that zm is not an accumulation point. Hence, z⋆̸= zn for all n ∈N.
Then we prove that z⋆/∈B (zn, rn) for all n ∈N.
Contrariwise. Assume that z⋆∈B (zm, rm) for some m ∈N. Then
zn /∈B (zm, rm)
whenever n > m.
Since
B (z⋆, rm −|z⋆−zm|) ⊆B (zm, rm) ,
we again conclude that z⋆cannot be an accumulation point. Hence, z⋆/∈B (zn, rn) for all n ∈N.
Then note that since z⋆∈A, there is an r⋆> 0, such that B (z⋆, r⋆) ∈A belongs to our system, and
since z⋆is an accumulation point, there are inﬁnitely many of the points zn lying in the smaller disc

which clearly is a contradiction.
We conclude that the process indeed stops after a ﬁnite number of steps, and we have selected a ﬁnite
covering from any given open covering of the bounded and closed set A, so we have ﬁnally proved that
A is compact. □
Remark 2.1.5 A closer look on the present proof of a bounded and closed set being compact shows
that it relies heavily on the geometry described in Figure 9, but not at all on the special algebraic
structure of C. A simple consequence is that whenever one can talk of halving intervals, squares,
cubes etc. as in Figure 9, or similarly, then every bounded and closed set is also compact, so the
halving property is suﬃcient, though not necessary for this result. We shall not here give the precise
condition, which does not assume the halving property. ♦

The trouble of the proof of Theorem 2.1.2 is now really rewarded, because a simple consequence is
Theorem 2.1.3 First main theorem for continuous functions. Assume that f : Ω→C is continuous.
Then the image f(A) of every compact set A ⊂Ωis also compact.
Proof. Let {ωj | j ∈J} be any open covering of f(A). It follows from A ⊂Ωand f being contin-
uous that

f ◦−1 (ωj)
 j ∈J

is an open covering of the compact set A. Hence, it contains a ﬁnite
covering

f◦−1 (ωj)
 j = 1, . . . , n

. Finally, applying the map f we obtain that {ωj | j = 1, . . . , n}
is a ﬁnite covering of f(A), so f(A) is also compact. □
Remark 2.1.6 The proof of Theorem 2.1.3 is general and it is not linked to the complex numbers.
If e.g. instead f : R →R is a continuous and real function, and A ⊂R is some bounded and closed,
i.e. compact set, then the image f(A) is again bounded and closed. In particular, f(A) contains a
maximum and a minimum. ♦
Relative topology.
So far the topological space (or universe) has been open. We shall now consider any subset of this uni-
verse and deﬁne the relative topology inherited from the topology of the larger space. This construction
will be general, even if we apparently only consider C or R.

Figure 10: Deﬁnition of the relative topology on a subset A.
Let A ⊂C (or ⊂R) be any nonempty subset. A set ω ⊆A is called relatively open in A, if there is
an open set Ω⊆C (or ⊆R), such that
ω = A ∩Ω.
Let O denote the system of open sets in C (or R), cf. Deﬁnition 2.1.1, and let OA denote the set of
relatively open sets in A. Then clearly,
OA = {A ∩Ω| Ω∈O},
from which follows that OA also satisﬁes the three conditions of a topology, mentioned earlier. We
call OA the relative topology on A.

Example 2.1.1 Open sets in the relative topology of a set A may not be open in the larger space.
A simple example is given by the relative open sets in the closed interval [0, 1]. These are
1) the ordinary open sets in ] 0, 1 [,
2) the open sets in ] 0, 1 [, supplied with one or both of the endpoints {0} and {1}.
We have e.g. for the half open interval [0, a [, 0 < a ≤1 which is not open in the larger space R, that
[0, a [ = ] −a, a [ ∩[0, 1] = ] −a, a [ ∩A
for 0 < a ≤1.
Since ] −a, a [ is open in R, it follows that [0, a [ is open relative to A = [0, 1], but not in the larger
space R. ♦
Since the relative topology OA on A satisﬁes the general conditions of a topology, we immediately get
Deﬁnition 2.1.5 A function f : A →C is continuous, if
f ◦−1(Ω) ∈OA
for all Ω∈O.

There is no need to assume that f is mapping into C, so we get immediately the extension of this
deﬁnition to
Deﬁnition 2.1.6 Given two nonempty topological spaces A and B, and let OA and OB denote the
systems of (relatively) open sets in A, resp. B. a map f : A →B is continuous, if
f◦−1(Ω) ∈OA
for all Ω∈OB.
Connected sets.
Deﬁnition 2.1.6 is the most general deﬁnition of a continuous map. We notice the following special
case which will be applied below. Let A be any topological space, and choose B = Z, i.e. the set of
all integers with the relative topology from R. It follows for any n ∈Z that
{n} = Z ∩B

and
{n} = Z \





.
It follows from the former equation that every n ∈Z is a relatively open set, and from the latter
equation that it is also the relative complement of an open set, hence relatively closed. We conclude
that every point n ∈Z is both open and closed in the relative topology OZ of Z.
Deﬁnition 2.1.7 A subset A ⊆C is said to be connected, if the only possible continuous maps
f : A →Z with the relative topology OZ are the constant functions.
A less abstract description of a connected set is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 2.1.4 A subset A of C is not connected, if and only if we can ﬁnd two nonempty disjoint
relatively open subsets A1, A2 ∈OA, such that
A = A1 ∪A2,
A1 ∩A2 = ∅,
A1, A2 ∈OA.
Proof. If there exists a disjoint splitting of A into two relatively open sets as above, we deﬁne a map
f : A →Z by
f(z) =



1
for z ∈A1,
2
for z ∈A2,
A = A1 ∪A2,
A1 ∩A2 = ∅.
Then f ◦−1({1}) = A1 ∈= OA and f ◦−1({2}) = A2 ∈=A, so f is continuous. Clearly, f is not a
constant function (it has two diﬀerent values), so A cannot be connected.
Conversely, assume that A is not connected. There exists a continuous and non-constant function
f : A →Z. Without loss of generality we may assume that f(A) = {1, 2}.
It follows from the assumption of continuity that
A1 = f ◦−1({1}) ∈OA
and
A2 = f ◦−1({2}) ∈OA,
and it is obvious that
A1 ̸= ∅,
A2 ̸= ∅,
A = A1 ∪A2,
and
A1 ∩A2 = ∅.

Corollary 2.1.1 An open and nonempty set Ωis connected, if and only if for every possible disjoint
splitting Ω= Ω1 ∪Ω2 of Ωinto two open sets, the set Ω1 is either ∅or Ω, corresponding to Ω2 is
either Ωor ∅.
Proof. Using contraposition we shall prove that the open set Ωis not connected, if and only if there
is a nontrivial disjoint open splitting Ω= Ω1 ∪Ω2, i.e. Ω1 ̸= ∅and ̸= Ω, and both Ω1 and Ω2 are
open sets. This has already been proved in Theorem 2.1.4.
The following theorem now follows immediately from Corollary 2.1.1.
Theorem 2.1.5 Second main theorem for continuous functions. Every connected set is mapped by
any continuous function into another connected set.
Proof. Let f : A →f(A) be continuous, and assume A is connected. Let g : f(A) →Z be any
continuous function. We shall prove that g is a constant function.
We know that the composite map g ◦f : A →Z is continuous, so g ◦f is constant, because A is
connected. This means that g : f(A) →Z is constant. Since g was any continuous function, we
conclude that f(A) is connected. □
We proceed by including some more deﬁnitions from Point Set Theory. Traditionally they should have
been in the same section as the deﬁnition of topology, but we have judged that it would be better, if
they were put closer to the place, where they are applied.
Deﬁnition 2.1.8 A boundary point of a set A is a point z0, such that
A ∩B (z0, r) ̸= ∅
and
∁A ∩B (z0, r) ̸= ∅
for all r > 0.
A boundary point of A may, or may not, be an element of A.
The set of all boundary points is called the boundary, and it is denoted by ∂A.
An isolated point of A is a point z0 ∈A, for which there exists an r > 0, such that
A ∩B (z0, r) = {z0} .
The interior A◦of A is the largest open set contained in A. The closure ¯A of A is the complement of
the interior of the complement of A, i.e. A = ∁

{∁A}◦
.
It is easy to prove that ¯A = A◦∪∂A, that A◦, ∂A and {∁A}◦form a disjoint splitting of C =
A◦∪∂A ∪{∁A}◦for every subset A, and that an isolated point is always a boundary point.
In Complex Functions Theory we shall mostly deal with (nonempty) open connected sets. Such sets
are also called open domains. A domain is a set, such that its interior is an open domain. If a domain
also is closed, we call it a closed domain.

An important theorem is
Theorem 2.1.6 In an open domain A, any two points z0 and z ∈A can always be joined by a
continuous curve, which lies entirely in A.
Proof. Choose any z0 ∈A, and let A1 denote the set of all z ∈A, which can be joined with z0 by a
continuous curve Γz ⊂A, lying entirely in A.
Let z ∈A1 ⊆A. Since A is open, there is an r > 0, such that B(z, r) ⊆A. Then note that every
point w ∈B(z, r) can be joined with z0 by a continuous curve by using Γz to get from z0 to z and
then continue from z to w by following the corresponding radius lying also in A. Hence, B(z, r) ⊆A1,
and it follows that the set A1 is open. Clearly, z0 ∈A1, so A1 ̸= ∅.
Put A2 = A \ A1. Then A2 is the set of all points z ∈A, which cannot be joined with z0 by any
continuous curve in A. Repeating the argument on A1 above with obvious modiﬁcations we also
conclude that A2 is open.
Then we have a disjoint splitting of A = A1 ∪A2 into two open sets. Since A is connected, and
A1 ̸= ∅, we must have A2 = ∅, so A1 = A, and the claim is proved. □

Figure 11: The set of the union of the graph of the function sin 1
x, x > 0, and the Y -axis is connected,
and yet no point on the axis can be joined with any point on the graph by a continuous curve lying
entirely in this set.
Example 2.1.2 If A is not an open domain, but just a connected set, we may not be able to join
two points in A by a curve. The classical example is the union of the graph of sin 1
x, x > 0, and the
Y -axis, cf. Figure 11. ♦
The domains in Complex Functions Theory will usually be nice in the following sense that their
boundaries will be composed of isolated points and/or continuous and piecewise diﬀerentiable curves,
mostly just line segments, half lines, lines, circular arcs or circles.
Later on, the isolated points of the boundary will in particular be extremely important in the so-called
residue calculus.

Another description is that a simply connected set Ωis “without holes”. If we consider its complement
C\Ωwritten as a disjoint union of maximal open sets (its connected components), then all its connected
components are unbounded.
If n −1 of the connected components of the complement C \ Ωare bounded, we also say that Ωis
n-connected.
A typical example is, when Ωis the open unit disc with the exception of n−1 diﬀerent points inside the
unit circle. This set Ωis n-connected. Again we refer to residue calculus for important applications.
We have noted that simple closed curves have started to appear. Such curves will always be continu-
ous, and piecewise diﬀerentiable and without double points (intersection points, etc.), and their two
endpoints will always coincide. Such curves will always be given a sense of orientation, i.e. the way it
is traversed according to its parametric description.
We shall adopt the following convention that if a simply or multiply connected domain Ωis bounded
by closed curves as above, then Ωalways lies to the left on any of these curves, seen in their sense of
orientation.

Uniform continuity.
Deﬁnition 2.1.10 A map f : Ω→C is uniformly continuous in the set Ω, if to every ε > 0 there is
δ = δ(ε) > 0 only depending on ε, such that for all x, y ∈Ω,
|f(x) −f(y)| < ε,
whenever |x −y| < δ.
The importance of uniform continuity is demonstrated by the following
Theorem 2.1.7 Third main theorem for continuous functions. Every continuous function f on a
compact set K is uniformly continuous.
Proof. Since f is continuous, we have, expressed by quantiﬁers,
∀ε > 0 ∀x ∈K ∃δx > 0 ∀y ∈Ω: |x −y| < δx
⇒
|f(x) −f(y)| ≤ε
2,
where δx depends on both ε and x. The condition above can also be written by using sets instead,
∀ε > 0 ∀x ∈K ∃δx > 0 : f (B (x, δx) ∩K) ⊆B

and let x, y ∈K satisfy |x −y| < δ. Since B is a covering of K, we have x ∈B

for some
j, so by the triangle inequality,
|y −xj| ≤|y −x| + |x −xj| ≤δ + 1
2 δj < 1
2 δj + 1
2 δj = δj,
so y ∈B (xj , δj).
Also, x ∈B (xj , δj), so by using the triangle inequality once more we get
|f(y) −f(x)| ≤|f(y) −f (xj)| + |f(x) −f (xj)| < ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.
Here, δ is independent of the arbitrarily chosen points x and y ∈K, so it follows that f is uniformly
convergent. □

The Fix Point Theorem and some of its consequences.
We shall later need the Theorem of Implicit Given Functions and the Theorem of Inverse Mapping. In
the proofs of these important theorems we shall use the Fix Point Theorem. Since all these theorems
are of interest in a more general setting, and the proofs are rarely seen in elementary textbooks, we
shall prove these theorems in Rn instead of just restrict ourselves to C ∈R2.
Thus we consider the Euclidean space Rn with its norm given by
∥x∥:=

x2
1 + · · · + x2n
for x = (x1. . . . , xn) ∈Rn.
Deﬁnition 2.1.11 Let f : Rn →Rn be a map. A point x0 ∈Rn is called a ﬁx point of f, if
(45) f (x0) = x0.
The map f is called a contraction, if there is a constant C ∈[0, 1[, such that
(46) ∥f(x) −f(y)∥≤C ∥x −y∥.
We shall without proof use the well-known fact that (Rn, +, ·, ∥· ∥) is a complete vector space, i.e.
every Cauchy sequence is also convergent.
Theorem 2.1.8 The Fix Point Theorem. If f : Rn →Rn is a contraction indexcontraction, then f
has precisely one ﬁx point x0 ∈Rn.
Proof. Uniqueness, i.e. there is at most one ﬁx point. In fact, assume that both x1 and x2 are ﬁx
points, so f (x1) = x1 and f (x2) = x2. Then
∥x1 −x2∥= ∥f (x1) −f (x2)∥≤C · ∥x1 −x2∥.
Since f is a contraction, 0 ≤C < 1, so this inequality only holds for ∥x1 −x2∥= 0, i.e. x1 = x2, and
we have proved uniqueness.
Existence. Choose any x ∈Rn, and consider the sequence
x,
f(x),
f(f(x)),
. . . ,
f ◦p(x),
. . . ,
where f ◦p = f ◦· · · ◦f (p “factors”) denotes p compositions of f with itself. Since f is a contraction,
we get by using the triangle inequality,

which is possible, because x ∈Rn is ﬁxed, and Cp →0 decreasingly for p →+∞. Then it follows
from the estimate above that
f ◦(p+m)(x) −f ◦p(x)
 < ε
for all p ≥N and all m ∈N.
This is the condition that (f ◦p(x))p∈N is a Cauchy sequence in Rp for every given x. Since Rn is a
complete space, this Cauchy sequence is convergent, so
f ◦p(x) →x0 ∈Rn
for p →+∞.
The trick is to notice that when we apply f on this limit (and change indices from p + 1 to p), then
also
f ◦p(x) →f (x0) ∈Rn,
and the two limit points are equal, hence f (x0) = x0, and we have proved that x0 is a ﬁx point. □
It follows from the uniqueness above that we shall always get the same limit x0 ∈Rn, no matter
which x ∈Rn we use as our initial value. This method is called the iteration method, or the method
of successive approximations.

We consider the spaces Rk of points x = (x1, . . . , xk) and Rp of points y = (y1, . . . , yp), and an open

Proof. It follows from the assumptions that f ′
y(x, y) is continuous, so there are constants a′, b′ > 0,
such that
det f ′
y(x, y) ̸= 0
for ∥x −x0∥< a′ and ∥y −y0∥< b′.

Since f (x0, y0) = 0, it follows that
T (x0, y0) = y0.
Clearly, the map T : Ω→Rp is continuous partial derivatives with respect to y1, . . . , yp.
Since

y (x0, y0) = 0, which implies that

for r, s = 1, . . . , p.
The elements of T′

We conclude from (51) for all x ∈Rk, for which ∥x −x0∥≤a, and all y, y⋆∈Rp, for which

for ∥x −x0∥≤a and ∥y −y0∥≤b.
When we combine this estimate with (52) for ∥x −x0∥≤a and ∥y −y0∥≤b, then we get by the

(54) ∥T(x, y) −y0∥≤∥T(x, y) −T (x, y0)∥+ ∥T (x, y0) −y0∥≤b

It follows from (53) and (54) that T(x, y) deﬁnes for every ﬁxed x ∈A := {x ∈Rk | ∥x −x0∥≤a} a
map of B := {y ∈Rp | ∥y −y0∥≤b} into itself, i.e.
T(x, ·) : B →B
for every ﬁxed x ∈A,
and T(x, ·) is clearly a contraction of constant 1

The set B is closed, and all yn ∈B, hence also yn →y ∈B. According to Theorem 2.1.8, The Fixed
Point Theorem, there is precisely one point y ∈B, such that
T(x, y) = y,
i.e.
f(x, y) = 0
by (50).
Hence, y = g(x) is a function of x ∈A, i.e. g : A →B, and we have
f(x, g(x)) = 0
for x ∈A.
It follows for every x ∈A that yn(x) →g(x), i.e. more precisely by the iteration process,
∥yn(x) −g(x)∥≤

b,
so the convergence is uniform in A.
The expression of T(x, y) implies that all the functions yn(x) are continuous in A, and since the limit
function of a uniformly convergent sequencer of continuous functions is also continuous, it follows that
g(x) is also continuous. □
It is worth noticing that if f(x, y) has some nice diﬀerentiability properties, and the equation f(x, y) =
0 implicitly deﬁnes a function g(x), such that f(x, g(x)) = 0, then g(x) inherits these diﬀerentiability
properties, and the (partial) derivatives of g(x can be found by a process called implicit diﬀerentiation.
We have more precisely
Theorem 2.1.10 Theorem of Implicit Diﬀerentiation. Let Ω⊆Rk+p be an open set, and let
f : Ω→Rp be a map, such that the coordinate functions f1, . . . , fp : Ω→R are all continuous
functions of continuous partial derivatives of order ≤n with respect to all the variables x1, . . . , xk and
y1, . . . , yp. Let (x0, y0) ∈Ωbe a solution of the equation
f(x, y) = 0,
and assume that the Jacobian f ′
y(x, y) with respect to the variables y1, . . . , yp is regular at the point
(x0, y0), i.e. det f ′
y (x0, y0) ̸= 0. Then the coordinate functions g1, . . . , gp of the function y = g(x)
have continuous partial derivatives of order ≤n with respect to x1, . . . , xk.
These partial derivatives of g1, . . . , gp with respect to x1, . . . , xk are found by implicit diﬀerentiation,
i.e. one diﬀerentiates the p equations
f1(x, g(x)) = 0, . . . , fp(x, g(x)) = 0
with respect to the k variables x1, . . . , xk, and then solves the system of equations with respect to each
∂gj
∂xk
, and similarly for higher order derivatives.
Proof. We have already proved in Theorem 2.1.9 that g(x) exists and is continuous in a set
(55) A =

x ∈Rk | ∥x −x0∥≤a

for some a > 0.
It suﬃces to prove the theorem for n = 1, because then it will follow by induction for higher order
derivatives.
We assume that the coordinate functions f1, . . . , fp all have continuous partial derivatives of ﬁrst order
with respect to all the variables x1, . . . , xk and y1, . . . , yp.

Let the set A in (55) be speciﬁed by the proof of Theorem 2.1.9, and consider two neighbouring points
in A,
x = (x1, . . . , xk)
and
x + ∆x = (x1 + ∆x1, . . . , xk + ∆xk) ∈A.
Then both points (x, g(x)) and (x + ∆x, g(x + ∆x)) belong to the solution set F.
We introduce the shorthand
∆g := g(x + ∆x) −g(x) = (∆g1, . . . , ∆gp) .
For every j = 1, . . . , p,
fj(x, g(x)) = 0
and
fj(x + ∆x, g(x + ∆x)) = 0,
hence by Taylor’s formula,

It follows from the assumptions of the theorem that when ∆x →0, then all the coeﬃcients converge
towards the corresponding partial derivative at (x, g(x)). In particular, the coeﬃcient matrix of the
∆g column converges towards the regular Jacobian f ′
x, g(x)), so by the continuity, this coeﬃcient

Theorem 2.1.11 Theorem of Inverse Map. Let Ωbe an open and nonempty subset of Rp, and let
f : Ω→Rp be a map of class C1(Ω), i.e. all its coordinate functions have continuous derivatives of
ﬁrst order with respect to all the variables. Let y0 ∈Ωbe a point, for which the matrix f ′
y (y0) is
regular, and put x0 = f (y0).
There exist constants a, b > 0, corresponding to the sets
A = {x ∈Rp | ∥x −x0∥≤a} ⊆Rp,
B = {y ∈Ω| ∥y −y0∥≤b} ⊂Ω,
and a map g : A →B of class C1(A), such that
{(f(y), y) ∈A × B} = {(x, g(x)) | x ∈A}.
Proof. Let f : Ω→Rp be as in the assumptions. Choose k = p and put Ω1 = Rp × Ω. Then deﬁne
a map F : Ω1 →Rp by
F(x, y) := f(y) −x,
for x ∈Rp and y ∈Ω.
The corresponding coordinate functions F1, . . . , Fp are all of class C1 (Ω1), and the solution set of the
equation
(61) F(x, y) = f(y) −x = 0
in Ω1,
is clearly the set
{(f(y), y) | y ∈Ω}.
On the other hand, we can also solve (61) by Theorem 2.1.9, whenever (x0, y0) ∈Ω1 is a point, for
which
f (y0) = x0
and
det f ′
y (y0) ̸= 0,
from which we obtain the description y = g(x) in a neighbourhood of x0, and the theorem follows. □
Theorem 2.1.11 on inverse mappings tells us that under the given assumptions, for every x ∈A there
is precisely one y ∈B, in fact y = g(x), for which x = f(y).
The partial derivatives of g1, . . . , gp are found from the matrix equation
g′
x(x) =

f ′
y(g(x))
−1 .
In particular, g′
x(x) is regular for all x ∈A.
If the functions f1, . . . , fp all belong to Cn(Ω), then the functions g1, . . . , gp will all belong to Cn(A).

2.2
Complex functions
A complex function f : Ω→C is a function w = f(z), deﬁned on a domain Ω⊆C, which is a subset
of C.
Conventionally we write z = x+iy ∈Ωin the domain, and w = u+iv ∈C for the values in the range.
The letters have been chosen from German: “Zahl = number” and “ Wert = value”. We always let
tacitly x + iy and u + iv denote their splitting into real and imaginary parts.
If we turn to the geometrical interpretation of the complex plane, then it follows that a complex
function
w = f(z),
z ∈Ω⊆C,
w ∈C,
is equivalently described by a pair of real functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) in two real variables
(x, y) ∈Ω1 ⊆R2, where R2 ⊇Ω1 ∼Ω⊆C by the usual correspondence. Hence,
w = f(z) = u + iv = u(x, y) + iv(x, y).
This pair of real functions (u(x, y), v(x, y)) in two real variables will be very important in the following,
as well as its shorter description as a complex function w = f(z).
Using the deﬁnitions of Section 2.1 we repeat the following simple result.
Theorem 2.2.1 A complex function f : Ω→C is continuous [at a point z0 = x0 + iy0 ∈Ω], if and
only if the two corresponding real functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) in two real variables are both continuous
[at the point (x0, y0) ∈Ω1].
This means that a continuous complex function inherits all the usual simple theorems of continuous
real functions of two real variables. Here, we only mention the following obvious
Theorem 2.2.2 Finite sums, diﬀerences, products and quotients (when the denominator is ̸= 0) of
continuous complex functions are all continuous complex functions.
If the composition of two continuous complex functions is deﬁned, then it is again continuous.
The proof of the latter claim follows directly from Theorem 2.1.1.
Example 2.2.1 In order to become familiar with this new concept of a complex function we shall
here investigate the simple complex function w = f(z) = z2 deﬁned on the closed disc Ω= {z ∈C |
|z −1| ≤1} of centrum 1 ∼(1, 0) ∈R2 and radius 1.
It follows from the computation
w = u + iv = z2 = (x + iy)2 = x2 −y2 + i · 2xy
by taking the real and imaginary parts that
u(x, y) = x2 + y2
and
v(x, y) = 2xy.

Figure 16: The image f(Ω) of the closed disc Ω= {z ∈C | |z −1| ≤1} by the map w = f(z) = z2.
Both functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) are continuous in R2, and
Ω1 =

(x, y) ∈R2 | (x −1)2 + y2 ≤1

∼Ω= {z ∈C | |z −1| ≤1}
is compact. From Theorem 2.1.3 follows that f(Ω) is also compact.
Furthermore, Ω1 is connected, hence by Theorem 2.1.5 the image f(Ω) is also connected.
In order to get an idea of where f(Ω) is lying in C we ﬁnd the image of the boundary curve of Ω1 ∼Ω,
described here most conveniently in polar coordinates. The boundary curve of Ω1 is described by
r = r(θ) = 2 · cos θ,
−π
2 ≤θ ≤π
2 ,
in polar coordinates, cf. also Figure 16. Hence, the image is given by
w = z2 =

r(θ) · eiθ2 = 4 cos2 θ · ei2θ = 2(1 + cos 2θ) · ei2θ.
Then change parameter to ϕ = 2θ ∈[−π, π] to get the boundary curve of the image in polar coordinates
(R, ϕ) in the w-plane,
R = R(ϕ) = 2 · (1 + cos ϕ),
ϕ ∈[−π, π],
which is the equation of a cardioid, thus in particular a closed curve.
Since f(Ω) is compact, in particular bounded, this image is lying inside the cardioid.
Note that if the circle is traversed in the positive direction of the plane, then the same is true for the
cardioid, and the interiors, Ω◦and f(Ω)◦, are lying to the left in the sense of orientation of the curve.
This is a general principle for those complex maps we are going to study in these three books. ♦
2.3
Complex limits and complex sequences
Formally the introduction of limits and complex sequences is the same as is the real case. Nevertheless,
the reader should be very careful here, because there is a hidden diﬀerence in the geometry, which has
a very strong impact on the rest of the theory. The diﬀerence lies in the fact that a limit in C is far
more restrictive than a limit in R.

If x →x0 in R, we shall only consider two directions of the limit. Either x →x0−from below, or
x →x0+ from above. However, in C the limit z →z0 does not specify any direction of preference,
only that the limit must be the same, no matter how |z −z0| →0.
This fundamental diﬀerence
in the geometry causes a very strong diﬀerence in the concepts of real diﬀerentiability and complex
diﬀerentiability. Therefore, the reader who is not familiar with complex functions should be very
cautious in understanding the deﬁnitions below and their diﬀerence from the real case. They are not
obvious at all!
Complex limits
Let z0 ∈Ωbe a point of a set Ω⊆C. We start by recalling that z0 is not an isolated point in Ω, if
for every r > 0 there is a point z ∈Ω\ {z0} lying in an r-neighbourhood of z0, i.e. such that
0 < |z −z0| < r,
z ∈Ω.

Deﬁnition 2.3.1 Assume that z0 ∈Ωis not an isolated point of Ω, and let f : Ω\ {z0} →C be a
complex function.
The function f(z) has the complex limit c ∈C for z →z0 in Ω, if one to every ε > 0 can ﬁnd a
δ > 0, such that
|f(z) −c| < ε
for all z ∈Ωfor which 0 < |z −z0| < δ = δ(ε).
When this is the case we write
lim
z∈Ω
z→z0
f(z) = lim
z→z0 f(z) = c,
or
f(z) →c for z →z0 in Ω,
where the notation limz→z0 f(z) tacitly assumes that the limit takes place in the set Ω.
It follows from Deﬁnition 2.3.1 that if f is deﬁned and continuous at z0, then
lim
z→z0 f(z) = c = f (z0) .
In many cases we also need to deﬁne the limit when f(z) tends to inﬁnity. To make this precise we
introduce
Deﬁnition 2.3.2 Assume that z0 ∈Ωis not an isolated point of Ω, and let f : Ω\ {z0} →C be a
complex function. If to every K > 0 we can ﬁnd a δ > 0, such that
|f(z)| > K
for all z ∈Ωfor which 0 < |z −z0| < δ = δ(K),
then we say that f(z) tends towards (complex) inﬁnity, ∞, for z →z0 in Ω, and we either write
lim
z∈Ω
z→z0
f(z) = lim
z→z0 f(z) = ∞
or
f(z) →∞for z →z0 in Ω.
Note that this is the ﬁrst time that we see the complex inﬁnity ∞, which we write without any sign in
front of it. We shall discuss this more thoroughly in Section 2.4, because there is a diﬀerence between
real and complex inﬁnities which may not be confused.
Using Deﬁnition 2.3.2 above it is now possible also to deﬁne what we mean by a limit of the function
f(z), when z →∞in Ω.
Deﬁnition 2.3.3 Let f : Ω→C be a complex function deﬁned on an unbounded region Ω.
Let c ∈C be a constant. If to every given ε > 0 there exists a K = K(ε) > 0, such that
|f(z) −c| < ε
for all z ∈Ω, for which |z| > K,
we say that f(z) has the limit c ∈C for z →∞, and we write
lim
z∈Ω
z→∞
f(z) = lim
z→∞f(z) = c
or
f(z) →c for z →∞in Ω.
We say that f(z) tends to ∞for z →∞, if there to every C > 0 exists a constant K = K(C) > 0,
such that
|f(z)| > C
for all z ∈Ωfor which |z| > K.

In this case we write
lim
z∈Ω
z→∞
f(z) = lim
z→∞f(z) = ∞
or
f(z) →∞for z →∞in Ω.
Example 2.3.1 The two possibilities of Deﬁnition 2.3.3 are far from exhausting. We mention that
the limit of f(z) = exp(z) = ez, where the complex exponential was deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.2.1, does
not exist for z →∞. In fact, in the real we have
lim
x→+∞ex = +∞
and
lim
x→−∞ex = 0,
while on the imaginary axis eiy oscillates for both y →+∞and for y →−∞without having any
limit. ♦
Complex sequences
Here we introduce the complex sequences (zn), i.e. zn ∈C for n ∈N.
Formally, a complex sequence is deﬁned as a function f : N →C by f(n) = zn. This deﬁnition has
the advantage that the limit
lim
n→+∞zn =
lim
n→+∞f(n),
Ω= N,
is already deﬁned i Deﬁnition 2.3.3. It is therefore nothing new in the following deﬁnition. It has
only been restated because many readers will fell a little uneasy by this “abstract” reference to
Deﬁnition 2.3.3 applied on the function f : N →C, given by f(n) = zn.
Deﬁnition 2.3.4 Given a sequence (zn) of complex numbers. Given a constant c ∈C. If to every
ε > 0 there exists an N = N(ε) ∈N, such that
|zn −c| < ε
for every n ≥N = N(ε),
i.e. the diﬀerence between zn and c becomes numerically as small as we wish eventually, then we say
that the complex sequence (zn) converges towards the limit c ∈C, and we write
lim
n→+∞zn = lim zn = c
or
zn →c for n →+∞.
If instead, to every C > 0 there exists an N = N(C) ∈N, such that
|zn| > C
for every n ≥N = N(C),
i.e. if zn numerically can be as large as we want eventually, then we say that the complex sequence
(zn) tends to (complex) inﬁnity ∞for n →+∞, and we write
lim
n→+∞zn = lim zn = ∞
or
zn →∞for n →+∞.
Clearly, a complex sequence (zn), where zn = xn + iyn (split into its real and imaginary parts), is
convergent with the limit c = a + ib (also split into its real and imaginary parts), if and only if the
two real sequences (xn) and (yn) are both convergent with their limits lim xn = a and lim yn = b,
respectively. This observation implies that all the usual theorems on convergent sequences in R also
hold for convergent complex sequences in C. We mention

Theorem 2.3.1 Given two convergent complex sequences (zn) and (wn) of limits z0 and w0, respec-
tively. Then
lim
n→+∞(zn ± wn) = z0 ± w0
and
lim
n→+∞znwn = z0w0.
If furthermore, w0 ̸= 0, and wn ̸= 0 for all n ∈N (or just eventually), then also

Remark 2.3.1 We shall later see that we may relax the latter assumptions. In some cases, when
both z0 and w0 are 0, it may be possible to deﬁne the limit of the quotient sequence, even if we
formally have “0/0”. For the time being we shall stick to Theorem 2.3.1 above. ♦
2.4
The complex inﬁnity versus the real inﬁnities
n Complex Functions Theory there are two types of inﬁnity, namely oriented inﬁnity and non-oriented
inﬁnity. In the ﬁrst case we are given an orientation or direction, by which we mean a complex number
of unit length eiϕ, ϕ ∈[0, 2π[, and we consider the corresponding half line

z = eiϕt | t ∈R+

starting
at 0. When we let t →+∞along this half line, we say that z = eiϕt →eiϕ∞, i.e. z tends towards
inﬁnity in the direction eiϕ.
The most common cases are when eiϕ = +1, in which case z →+∞along the positive real axis, i.e.
z ∈R+ through this limit process, and when eiϕ = −1, in which case z →−∞along the negative
real axis, i.e. z ∈R−through this limit process. These are well-known from Real Calculus. However,
we now have obvious generalizations to e.g. z →i∞, in which case z tends towards inﬁnity along the
positive imaginary axis, and also z →−∞, when z tends towards inﬁnity along the negative imaginary
axis.
This deﬁnition may again be extended by translation. If a ∈R is a given constant, then it is obvious
that z →a+i∞means that z tends to inﬁnity along the half line {z = a + it | t ∈R+}, and similarly
for z →a −i∞. These two limits are e.g. used in connection with a formula of the inverse Laplace
transform.
It should also be mentioned that the limit z →eiϕ∞occurs in connection with other formulæ of some
inverse transforms to be deﬁned in Ventus: Complex Functions Theory a-3.
The structure of these oriented inﬁnities is now obvious: Select a half line and then let the restriction
of the given function to this half line tend towards inﬁnity.
However, we also introduced a complex inﬁnity (or more precisely, a non-oriented inﬁnity) in Deﬁni-
tion 2.3.2, Deﬁnition 2.3.3 and Deﬁnition 2.3.4. This inﬁnity was just denoted ∞without indicating
any sign or direction in front of this symbol. It z →∞, this means that the absolute value |z| →+∞
without any speciﬁcation of the direction of z, i.e. the argument of z is not at all speciﬁed by this
limit.
We see in particular that if zn →+∞, where all zn ∈R+, and wn →−∞where all wn ∈R−, then
also zn →∞and wn →infty in C. Clearly, this example shows that one cannot conclude from
zn →∞that either zn →+∞or zn →−∞. If e.g. zn = (−1)nn, then clearly all zn ∈R, and also

zn →∞in C (non-oriented inﬁnity) for n →+∞, but the limit of zn does not exist in R, because
z2n = +2n →+∞and z2n+1 = −(2n + 1) →−∞for n →+∞, and we do not identify +∞and −∞
as oriented inﬁnities. Only when we do not consider the orientation we identify these two inﬁnities,
but leaving out the orientation means also that the signs ± no longer make sense, so we cannot use
other symbols in this non-oriented case than ∞.
In order not to confuse ourselves we shall in the following consequently always write limn→+∞for a
limit taken over the positive real line instead of the usual one limn→∞, which is commonly used in
Real Calculus.

Remark 2.4.1 Another reason for writing ∞for this unspeciﬁed inﬁnity is that no ordering <⋆of C
will respect the elementary rules of calculus, a remark which we include here. It is well-known that the
usual ordering < of R ∪{+∞, −∞} respects the elementary rules of calculus, i.e. sums and products
of positive real numbers (including +∞) are again positive. Clearly, C can be ordered, e.g. by the
lexicographic ordering, but C cannot be ordered by any (complete) ordering <⋆, such that sums and
products of “positive elements” again are “positive”. In fact, assume that this was the case. Because
i ̸= 0, then either 0 <⋆i or 0 <⋆−i. Assume that 0 <⋆i. (The alternative 0 <⋆−i would give similar
computations, because (−1)2 = (−1)4 = 1; just modify the proof below.) By the assumption that
sums and products of “positive numbers” are “positive” we get the following contradiction,
0 <⋆i2 + i4 = −1 + 1 = 0,
because 0 = 0.

Complex line integrals
The complex line integrals are deﬁned similarly to the real line integrals with the important diﬀerence
that we also in some obscure way involve complex multiplication. We shall, however, ﬁrst start by
describing the type of complex curves which we shall consider in these books on Complex Functions
Theory.
Complex curves
All complex curves in the Ventus: Complex Functions Theory series will be of a restricted type given
by the following parametric description:
C :
z = z(t) = x(t) + i · y(t),
t ∈[a, b],
where [a, b] is a compact interval on the real axis. We shall later also consider the trivial modiﬁcations,
when the interval is unbounded, but for the time being we just consider a compact parametric inter-
val. Furthermore, the real functions x(t) and y(t) for t ∈[a, b] are always continuous and piecewise
continuously diﬀerentiable.
Each curve C inherits an orientation or sense of direction, speciﬁed by the increase of the parameter
t ∈[a, b], so the curve C starts at z(a) and ends at z(b). This orientation will always (mostly tacitly)
be assumed in the following.
If a curve C of the type above does not contain double points, we call it a simple curve.
Although the curves considered here – in spite of the restrictions on them – are fairly general, we
shall usually only consider simple curves for which each curve arc is either a straight line segment or
a circular arc in the complex plane. In some cases we also consider curves which are not simple, but
it will be extremely seldom – if ever – that we consider curves which are not composed by circular
arcs and line segments.

Figure 17: The complex line integral.
Under the given assumptions on C and f, the complex line integral

C f(z) dz is well-deﬁned. In fact,
if we write
f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y),
zk = xk + i yk,
xk+1 −xk = ∆xk,
yk+1 −yk = ∆yk,
ζk = ξk + i ηk,
u (ξk, ηk) = uk,
v (ξk, ηk) = vk,
then we get by splitting into real and imaginary parts,

where the terms on the right hand side of (63) are approximations of some real line integrals. This
shows that

where C and C⋆are geometrically the same curve in the Euclidean plane, i.e. C is the complex curve
in C, while C⋆represents the corresponding real curve in R2. It will not cause any misunderstanding,
if we in the following in both cases just write C.
An easy way to remember (64) is formally to use the computation
f(z) dz = (u + iv)(dx + i dy) = (u dx −v dy) + i(u dy + v dx),
and then continue with the familiar real line integrals along C on the right hand side of this equation.
It follows from (64) that all the usual rules of computations for real line integrals also hold for complex
line integrals. We mention the linearity,

where C = C1 + C2, i.e. C1 and C2 are two curves, and where C = C1 + C2 denotes the curve, which
is obtained by composition of the two curves C1 and C2.
An obvious extension of the addition of curves is to let −C denote the curve C of reversed orientation.
Then clearly,

We ﬁnally mention (without its simple proof) the following important result, which will be frequently
used in the following.

Later on a typical application of Theorem 2.5.1 will be to choose a sequence of curves Cn of corre-

which one would expect. This will indeed be proved later on, but at the same time we must warn the
reader that one cannot always generalize “obvious” rules from the real to the complex case. We shall
give an example by Theorem 2.5.2. ♦
Remark 2.5.1 Let Ω⊆R2 be an open domain, and let u, v : Ω→R be a pair of continuous real
functions. They clearly deﬁne a continuous vector ﬁeld (u(x, y), v(x, y)) on Ωwhich often can be given
physical interpretations, like e.g. the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂow, or a ﬁeld of forces. Let a curve C be given
by the parametric description z = z(t), where we usually in applications consider the parameter t as
the time. Then the real line integral
(70) W =

C
(u, v) · (dx, dy) =

C
u dx + v dy
is a measure of the work of a unit particle by the ﬁeld of forces along the curve C.
When C is a closed curve, (70) is called the circulation of the vector ﬁeld (u, v) along C. Let (u, v) in
such a case describe a ﬂow. If

C
u dx + v dy ̸= 0,
then this means that the ﬂow contains whirls inside C.
We note that if we are given the vector ﬁeld (u, v) is also makes sense to consider the real line integral
(71)

C
{−v(x, y) dx + u(x, y) dy}.
Assume that C is a closed C1 curve circling around a bounded domain Ωlying to the left of C, i.e. C
is given a positive orientation, then (71) describes the circulation of the vector ﬁeld (−v, u) along the
boundary ∂Ω= C. Since (−v, u) is obtained by a rotation of +π
2 of the original vector ﬁeld (u, v), it
follows that (71) expresses the ﬂow of the velocity ﬁeld (u, v) through this boundary.

The reader may ﬁnd more details on these real line integrals in R2 in the Ventus: Calculus 2 series.
Here we shall use them as a bridge to Complex Functions Theory via complex line integrals. ♦
Remark 2.5.2 A very often used technique is to add a line integral and then subtract it again, so
that we may obtain two simpler line integrals.

Figure 19: Splitting of a complex line integral along a closed curve into two simpler line integrals of
the same type by adding and subtracting a complex line integral.

Γ
f(z) dz =

C1
f(z) dz −

C1
f(z) dz = 0,
so we just add 0 to the line integral. This may seem trivial, but the idea is that one complicated line
integral may be replaced by a sum of simple line integrals along closed curves, hence also complicated
domains may be broken up into a sum of simple domains.
The domain of Figure 19 is, however, not so complicated. The ﬁgure only serves to show the principle.
The boundary of the domain Ωis here a circle. By adding a diameter and then subtracting it again
we just add 0 to the corresponding line integral, but the line integral along the closed circle (positive
orientation) can now be written as the sum of two line integrals along the boundaries of the two half
discs, both with a positive orientation. ♦
In Complex Functions Theory, line integrals along closed simple curves are occurring frequently, there-
fore we introduce a special notation for such line integrals.
Let C be a simple closed curve with positive orientation, then we denote the line integral along C of
a function f(z) by

C
f(z) dz.
If instead C is a simple closed curve with negative orientation, then we write

for this line integral.
For such closed simple curves, any point may be chosen as its start (and end) point.
As already indicated in Remark 2.5.2 we shall see that complicated complex line integrals often can
be reduced to a sum of complex line integrals along simple closed curves. In order to deal with such
simple line integrals we here prove the following extremely important theorem, the profound impact
of which will be made clear later on.

because x2 + y2 = r2 is constant on the integration path and the diﬀerential form is exact, and the

This is not the case for the imaginary part, in which case we instead split the integral in the following

The reason for this messy computation (there are many variants of this) is that
ω =

(x, y) ̸= (0, 0),
is the classical example of a closed diﬀerential form which is not exact, because all the curves |z| = r
circle around a domain which is not simply connected. ♦
In Complex Functions Theory the most interesting case is when the line integral is independent of the
integration curve, as long as
1) the end points are kept ﬁxed,
2) the integration curve is deformed through elementary curves without singularities of the integrand.
Assume that f(z) = u(x, y)+iv(x, y), where both u and v are real C 1 functions in an open domain Ω,
which contains the integration curve C. It follows from the real calculus that a necessary condition
for these two conditions to hold is that the diﬀerential forms
(73) u dx −v dy
and
u dy + v dx
on the right hand side of (64) are both closed diﬀerential forms. (Theorem 2.5.1 shows that this is
not a suﬃcient condition).
We recall that the diﬀerential forms of (73) are closed in real calculus, if they fulﬁl
Cauchy-Riemann’s equations:
(74) ∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y
and
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x.
Remark 2.5.4 In Russian literature Cauchy-Riemann’s equations (74) are instead named after d’Alembert
and Euler. ♦
We shall see in Chapter 3 that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations (74) play a central rˆole in Complex
Functions Theory.
In engineering applications they are also fundamental in e.g. two-dimensional
Electrostatics and Hydrodynamics.
Remark 2.5.5 According to folklore the symbol ∂
∂x etc. of partial diﬀerentiation should have been
introduced by Euler in 1776. The author of this book have not been able to get this story conﬁrmed,
but it is plausible, because Euler at that time lived in St. Peterburg in Russia. When he needed a
notation of his newly invented partial diﬀerentiation he may have chosen the italicized Russian “d”.

Analytic Functions
The ﬁrst two chapters of this book have more or less been a revision of known facts from real calculus
and topology, and we have only occasionally mentioned complex functions.
In this chapter we shall introduce the main topic, namely the analytic functions. We shall, however,
start by ﬁrst introducing the complex diﬀerentiable functions.
3.1
Complex diﬀerentiable functions and analytic functions
The deﬁnition of complex diﬀerentiability of a complex function is formally identical with the deﬁ-
nition of real diﬀerentiability, and yet there is a fundamental diﬀerence between the two deﬁnitions,
which will give the complex continuously diﬀerentiable functions much better properties than the real
continuously diﬀerentiable functions. Therefore, one should not be misled to believe that the following
deﬁnition is “just the same as the deﬁnition of real diﬀerentiability”. This is not quite the case!
Deﬁnition 3.1.1 Let Ωbe an open and nonempty subset of C, and let f : Ω→C be a complex
function on Ω. The function f is complex diﬀerentiable at a point z0 ∈Ω, if the limit
(75) lim
z→zo
z∈Ω
f(z) −f (z0)
z −z0
exists. If this is the case, we denote this limit by
f′ (z0) ,
or
df
dz (z0) ,
or just df
dz or f ′.
If f is complex diﬀerentiable at z0, then it follows from (75) that f(z) →f (z0) for z →z0 in Ω, thus
f is continuous at z0.
That complex diﬀerentiability is a fairly strong property – stronger than real diﬀerentiability – follows
from the fact that the limit in (75) does not follow a speciﬁed direction as in the real case, where (by
changing the notation to real x) either x →x0−from below, or x →x0+ from above, and no other
possibility. In (75) we require that the limit is the same, no matter how z →z0, i.e. independently of
the direction.
We may on the other hand beneﬁt from the fact that the two deﬁnitions have formally identical
structures. This implies that every proof of a theorem of real diﬀerentiability which only relies on the
deﬁnition itself is straightforward carried over to complex diﬀerentiability. Hence we immediately get
the following theorem:

Theorem 3.1.1 Let f and g be two complex functions deﬁned on an open and nonempty set Ω⊆C,
and assume that both f and g are diﬀerentiable at the same point z ∈Ω. Then f + g, f −g, f · g, and
if also g(z) ̸= 0, the quotient f
g are all diﬀerentiable at the point z ∈Ω, and we have the following
diﬀerentiation rules
(f + g)′(z) = f ′(z) + g′(z),

if g(z) ̸= 0,
for the derivative of a quotient. This may be helpful in one situation, when one has arrived to an
expression like f ′(z)g(z) −f(z)g′(z). If we had had a + between the two terms, then we could reduce
it to (f · g)′(z). This is not the case here, but a multiplication with {g(z)}2
{g(z)}2 = 1 does the trick,
f ′(z)g(z) −f(z)g′(z) = {g(z)}2 · f ′(z)g(z) −f(z)g′(z)

Although Deﬁnition 3.1.1 contains an improvement compared with real diﬀerentiability, it still does
not quite have all the nice properties which we need. We therefore introduce a more restrictive class
of complex functions by the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.1.2 The complex function f : Ω→C is analytic (or holomorphic) in the open and
nonempty set Ω, if
1) the function f is complex diﬀerentiable at every z ∈Ω,
2) the derivative f ′ is continuous everywhere in Ω.
One of the main topics of these books is that the class of analytic functions have extremely nice
properties.
However, a strange thing is that condition 2) above in Deﬁnition 3.1.2 is not at all
necessary! It can be proved that it follows from condition 1). It is well-known that this unexpected
result does not hold for real diﬀerentiability, so being (real) analytic is a far stronger condition than
being just real diﬀerentiable. By a real analytic function we here understand an analytic function in
Ωrestricted to the set Ω∩R.
For practical reasons we shall for the time being require both conditions of Deﬁnition 3.1.2 of analytic
functions, without bothering too much with the fact that the latter of the two conditions is superﬂuous.
Obviously, Theorem 3.1.1 also holds for the class of analytic functions on Ω. In the same way we
prove

Theorem 3.1.2 The chain rule. Assume that f : Ω→C and g : Ω1 →C are analytic functions and
that f maps Ωinto Ω1, i.e. f(Ω) ⊆Ω1. Then the composite map g ◦f : Ω→C is also analytic, and
(g ◦f)′(z) = g′(f(z)) · f ′(z).
In fact, the proof of the chain rule in the real case only uses the formal deﬁnition of taking the limit
of a diﬀerence quotient, so the proof in the real is immediately carried over.
Example 3.1.1 Polynomials are analytic functions. So far we have not proved that there exists any
analytic function. It is, however, trivial that all constant functions are analytic. In fact, if f(z) = c,
then
lim
z→z0
f(z) −f (z0)
z −z0
= lim
z→z0
c −c
z −z0
= lim
z→z0 0 = 0,
so f ′(z) = 0 is continuous.
Furthermore, f(z) = z is also analytic,
lim
z→z0
f(z) −f (z0)
z −z0
= lim
z→z0
z −z0
z −z0
= lim
z→z0 1 = 1,
is also continuous, hence f(z) = z is analytic with f ′(z) = 1.
Then it follows from Theorem 3.1.1 that f(z) = zn = z · · · z is analytic, and by induction we derive
that f ′(z) = nzn−1. In fact, we have just proved this rule for n = 1. Assuming that it holds for some
n ∈N we get by Theorem 3.1.1 that
d
dz

zn+1
= d
dz {z · zn} = 1 · zn + z · nzn−1 = (n + 1)zn,
and the claim is proved.
Once we have proved the above, it immediately follows from Theorem 3.1.1 that every complex
polynomial P(z) is analytic with formally the same derivative P ′(z) as if it had been a real polynomial.
Finally, by diﬀerentiating a quotient of polynomials, every rational function R(z) = P(z)
Q(z), for
Q(z) ̸= 0, is analytic in the set C \ {z ∈C | Q(z) = 0} with the expected derivative

.We have shown in Example 3.1.1 that all polynomials and rational functions are
analytic functions. One may be misled by this to believe that if f ∈C∞(R) is a real C∞function, then
f(x) is made analytic by just writing f(z). This is not true! And yet the author has found this claim
in some textbooks! It is therefore of paramount importance immediately to give a counterexample.
Consider the function
w = f(z) = z = x −iy = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),

, and f(z) = z is continuous. However, it is not analytic. In fact, let
z = z0 + ∆z, where ∆z = ∆x + i∆y ̸= 0. When we check Deﬁnition 3.1.1, we get for the diﬀerence
quotient
f(z) −f (z0)
z −z0
= z0 + ∆z −z0
z0 + ∆z −z0
= ∆z
∆z = ∆x −i∆y
∆x + i∆y =



1
for
∆y = 0 and ∆x →0,
−1
for
∆x = 0 and ∆y →0.
We get (at least) two diﬀerent values of the “possible limit”, which means that the complex limit does
not exist at any point z0 ∈C, so f(z) = z is nowhere an analytic function. ♦
As mentioned earlier, an analytic function f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) may also be described by a pair
of real C1 functions (u(x, y), v(x, y)) in two real variables (x, y). Concerning notation we shall let d
dz
denote complex diﬀerentiation as deﬁned above, while diﬀerentiation with respect to either x or y is
always denoted as a partial diﬀerentiation, ∂
∂x and ∂
∂y , in spite of the fact, that if f ′(z) exists, then
f ′(z) = df
dz (z) = ∂u
∂x(x, y) + i∂v
∂x(x, y).
This is true, because partial diﬀerentiation with respect to x is just one way of ﬁnding the derivative.
On the other hand, we do not diﬀerentiate with respect to the other real variable y, so it is quite
reasonable to write the expression as a partial diﬀerentiation with respect to x.
We may of course use a similar construction, when we diﬀerentiate along the imaginary axis, i.e. with
respect to the purely imaginary variable iy, y ∈R. Then also
f ′(z) = 1
i · ∂u
∂y (x, y) + i
i · ∂v
∂y (x, y) = ∂v
∂y (x, y) −i ∂u
∂y (x, y),
so by identifying the real and the imaginary parts we once more have derived the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, cf. (74)
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y
and
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x.
Hence, we have proved the easy part of
Theorem 3.1.3 Let f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) be a complex function on the open and nonempty set
Ω, and assume that the real functions u and v are of class C1(Ω) in the corresponding real variables
x and y.
Then the complex function f(z) is analytic in Ω, if and only if u(x, y) and v(x, y) satisfy Cauchy-
Riemann’s equations in Ω,

The conclusion of Theorem 3.1.3 is not true, if either u or v is not of class C 1(Ω).
Continuation of the proof of Theorem 3.1.3. We assume that f(z) = u(x, y)+iv(x, y), where
u, v ∈C1 satisfy Cauchy-Riemann’s equations. We shall prove that f is analytic at any ﬁxed point
z0 = x0 + iy0 ∈Ω.
Let all the real partial derivatives in the following be developed in the corresponding point (x0, y0) in
R2. Then it follows from the deﬁnition of diﬀerentiability that

Since ∂u

here be considered as a constant, and since η →0 for ∆z →0, i.e.

hence f(z) is indeed complex diﬀerentiable at every z ∈Ωand its derivative is given by
(78) f ′(z) = ∂u
∂x + i ∂v
∂x.
Finally, since u and v ∈C1, it follows from (78) that the derivative f ′(z) is continuous in Ω, thus f(z)
is analytic. □
It follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations (76) and formula (78) that if f = u + iv is analytic, then
we can express the derivative f ′(z) by means of the partial derivatives of the functions u(x, y) and
v(x, y) in the following ways,
(79) f ′(z) = ∂u
∂x + i ∂v
∂x = ∂v
∂y −i ∂u
∂y = ∂u
∂x −i ∂u
∂y = ∂v
∂y + i ∂v
∂x.
We note in particular that the complex derivative f ′(z) can be expressed by (real) partial derivatives
of the real part u (resp. the imaginary part v) of f.
It was shown in Example 3.1.1 that every rational function R(z) = P(z)
Q(z) is analytic outside the zeros
of the denominator Q(z). Rich as this class may seem, it is not big enough for all our purposes. We
may now apply Theorem 3.1.3 to prove the existence of other types of analytic functions.
Theorem 3.1.4 The complex exponential exp(z), or ez, is analytic in C with the derivative

, and
∂u
∂x = ex cos y,
∂v
∂y = ex cos y,
∂u
∂y = −ex sin y,
∂v
∂x = ex sin y.
It follows immediately that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled, hence f(z) = exp(z) is analytic,
and if we use (79) we get the derivative
f ′(z) = ∂u
∂x + i ∂v
∂x = ex cos y + i ex sin y = ex{cos y + i sin y} = exp(z).
□
There are other ways to construct analytic functions outside the class of polynomials. We shall in
Example 3.1.3 give an example, in which we shall need the following theorem, which also will occur
later on in other connections.
Theorem 3.1.5 The theorem of inverse map. Assume that f : Ω→C is analytic in Ω, and let
z0 ∈Ωbe a point in which f ′ (z0) ̸= 0.
There exists an open and connected subset Ω0 of Ω, such that
1) The point z0 lies in Ω0, and f ′(z) ̸= 0 for every z ∈Ω0.
2) The set Ω0 is by f mapped bijectively onto an open and connected set ω0.
3) The inverse map g = f ◦−1 : ω0 →Ω0 is analytic in ω0, and its derivative is given by
g′ =
1
f ′ ◦g ,
i.e.
g′(w) =
1
f ′(g(w)), where w = f(z).
Proof.
Write z = x + iy and w = u + iv. Then the map w = f(z) is determined by the pair
of functions (u(x, y), v(x, y)), both of class C1. Putting f ′(z) = a(x, y) + ib(x, y), which exists by
assumption, it follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that the Jacobian is given by
∂(u, v)
∂(x, y) =

The corresponding determinant is then
a2 + b2 = |f ′(z)|2
(̸= 0 for z = z0) .
The function f ′(z) is continuous, hence it follows from Theorem 2.1.11 on page 63 that there is an open
neighbourhood Ω0 ⊆Ωof z0, which we without loss of generality of course may choose connected,

such that f ′(z) ̸= 0 in Ω0, and such that f maps Ω0 bijectively onto the open set ω0 = f (Ω0), which
by Theorem 2.1.5 on page 48 must be connected.
Thus, the inverse map z = g(w), g : ω0 →Ω0, exists, and it is given by the pair of functions x(u, v)
and y(u, v) ∈C1 (ω0), which has the Jacobian

a2 + b2 = ∂y

a2 + b2 = −∂y

proving that the pair (x(u, v), y(u, v)) satisﬁes Cauchy-Riemann’s equations in the variables (u, v).
Hence, g(w) is analytic with the (continuous) derivative
g′(w) = ∂x

∂u = a −ib
a2 + b2 =
a −ib
(a + ib)(a −ib) =

and the theorem follows. □

Example 3.1.3 Note that Theorem 3.1.5 is only a local result. Even if f ′(z) ̸= 0 for every z ∈Ω,
the function f(z) is not necessarily injective, which is demonstrated by the following.
Consider the complex exponential f(z) = exp(z). Then for every k ∈Z,
f(z + 2ikπ) = ex{cos(y + 2kπ) + i sin(y + 2kπ)} = ex{cos y + i sin y} = f(z),
proving that f(z) = exp(z) is periodic of period 2iπ. In particular, it cannot be injective on all of C.
On the other hand,
|f ′(z)| = | exp(z)| = |ex(cos y + i sin y)| = ex > 0,
for every z ∈C. This means that an inverse g(w) of exp(z) exists locally in a neighbourhood of every
given w : 0 ∈ω = f(C) = C \ {0}.
We shall not here give an explicit expression of such an inverse, because we shall return to it in
Example 3.2.1. Notice, however, that for everyone of these we can always, using Theorem 3.1.5, ﬁnd
its derivative. In fact, since w = f(z) = exp(z) = f ′(z),
g′(w) =
1
f ′(z) =
1
exp(z) = 1
w
for all w ∈ω0,
where ω0 is such a neighbourhood of w0 as speciﬁed in Theorem 3.1.5.
Clearly, the function g(w) must be connected with ideas which may be coined “the logarithm of w”,

Figure 20: A neighbourhood (an open disc) of z0 ∈C \ {0} not containing origo 0.
Let f(z) = u(x, y)+iv(x, y) be deﬁned in an open domain Ω, which does not contain z = 0, and choose
some z0 = x0 + iy0 ∈Ω. It is a local property of a pair of real functions to satisfy Cauchy-Riemann’s
equations. Thus it suﬃces to consider a subset Ω1 = B (z0, r) ⊆Ω, where r ∈]0, |z0|[. A glance
on Figure 20 shows that the points z ∈Ω1 are uniquely determined, not only by their rectangular
coordinates (x, y), but also by their polar coordinates in the following way.
It follows from Figure 20 that we can ﬁnd an α ∈R, such that
(r, Θ) ∈Ω⋆
1 ⊆R+× ]α, α + π[,
where α is determined by the tangent through 0 to the circle |z −z0| = |z0|. Thus we have a bijective
correspondence between the points of Ω1 in rectangular coordinates and the parameter domain Ω⋆
1 of
the polar coordinates, where this correspondence is given by
(80) x = r · cos Θ
and
y = r · sin Θ.
Then we have

∂y = y ∂u

and as r > 0 we get (81), so we have proved that the polar Cauchy-Riemann equations also hold.
Assume conversely the polar Cauchy-Riemann equations (81). Then it follows from (83) and (84) that

Example 3.2.1 Logarithms. It is customary in Complex Functions Theory to consider at least three
diﬀerent types of logarithms, so we give here a small introduction to these, leaving a more thorough
discussion of this matter to Ventus: Complex Functions Theory a-3.
In order not to confuse ourselves we shall always let ln : R+ →R denote the usual natural logarithm,
known from real calculus, and let Log, log, etc. denote some “complex logarithm”, which must be
speciﬁed. We introduce Log in this example, while the more diﬃcult log is postponed to Ventus:
Complex Functions Theory a-3.
Notice that since ln is not deﬁned on any open subset of C, it is not an analytic function in the sense
of Deﬁnition 3.1.2.

Figure 21: The domain Ωof the principal logarithm.
The principal logarithm Log : Ω→C is deﬁned on the complex plane with a slit, i.e. on
Ω= C \ {x ∈R | x ≤0} = C \ {R−∪{0}} ,
so the principal logarithm is deﬁned everywhere outside the closed negative real axis, i.e. outside
R−∪{0}.
Recalling the deﬁnition of the principal argument Arg z in Section 1.1 we see that Ωis the natural
open domain of Arg, i.e.
Arg z ∈] −π, π[
for z ∈Ω.
We now deﬁne the principal logarithm Log by
(86) Log z := ln |z| + i · Arg z = ln r + iΘ,
for z ∈Ω.
Clearly, both ln r and Θ are C∞functions of (r, Θ), and we see that

so Log fulﬁls the polar Cauchy-Riemann equations, hence f(z) = Log z is analytic in the open set Ω,
and its derivative is given by
f ′(z) = e−iΘ

Note that
exp(Log(z)) = exp(ln r + iΘ) = eln r · eiΘ = r eiΘ = z,
so the restriction of exp to the strip
f(Ω) = {w = u + iv | u ∈R, v ∈] −π, π[}
is the inverse of Log z, cf. also Example 3.1.3.
Finally, we note that if z ∈R+ ⊂Ω, then Log x = ln x, so in this sense Log is one possible analytic
extension of ln : R+ →R. ♦
In principle, analyticity of a function is closely related to some open set. However, it may sometimes
also be convenient to use more imprecise phrases like e.g. “f(z) is analytic in a closed set A”, or in
an even more general set. By this terminology we shall understand that there exists an open subset
ω of the domain of f, such that A ⊂ω, and such that f is analytic in the larger set ω. In particular,
if f is analytic at a point z0, this means that there exists an r > 0, such that the open disc B (z0, r)
is contained in the domain of f, and such that f is analytic in this disc B (z0, r).
3.3
Cauchy’s integral theorem
We shall now prove one of the main theorems in Complex Functions Theory and show some of its
consequences.
Theorem 3.3.1 Cauchy’s integral theorem, (A. Cauchy, 1825). Assume that the function f(z) is
analytic in a simply connected open domain Ω. Given two points z0 and z1 ∈Ω. The line integral

C f(z) dz, where C is any piecewise diﬀerentiable curve in Ωfrom z0 to z1, is independent of how C
goes from z0 to z1 in Ω.
Proof. This statement follows immediately from well-known results in real calculus. In fact, since

C
f(z) dz =

C
{u dx −v dy} + i

C
{u dy + v dx},
we see that

C f(z) dz does not depend on the integration path C from z0 to z1, if and only if the two
diﬀerential forms u dx −v dy and u dy + v dx are exact.
Now, f is analytic in Ω, so u(x, y) and v(x, y) are of class C1(Ω). Since Ωis simply connected, cf.
Deﬁnition 2.1.9, these diﬀerential forms are exact, if and only if they are closed, i.e. if and only if
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x
and
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y ,

which we recognize as Cauchy-Riemann’s equations.
These hold, because f(z) by assumption is
analytic in all of Ω. □
A frequently used variant of Cauchy’s integral theorem is the following.
Theorem 3.3.2 Assume that f(z) is analytic in a simply connected open domain Ω. Then

C
f(z) dz = 0
for every closed and piecewise diﬀerentiable curve C in Ω.
Proof. Cut the curve C into two curve segments, C = C1 + C2, where C1 starts at the point z0 and
ends at z1, while C2 goes from z1 to z0 instead. This implies that −C2 is again a curve from z0 and
z1, so we conclude from Cauchy’s integral theorem that

C1
f(z) dz =

Furthermore, Example 3.1.1 shows that 1

The method of Example 3.3.1 may of course be used on any other closed and piecewise diﬀerentiable
curve C which circles around z = 0. For all such curves C for which this circulation is 1 we therefore
have
C
1
z dz =

|z|=1
1
z dz = 2πi.
We note that if C does not circle around 0, then it follows trivially from Theorem 3.3.2 that

C
1
z dz = 0.
Roughly speaking, Cauchy’s integral theorem shows that a line integral along a closed curve C of an
analytic function on and inside C with the exception of one point z0 inside C can be transformed into
a circle Γ in Ωof centre z0, without changing the value of the line integral, i.e.

C
f(z) dz =

Γ
f(z) dz.
We shall later exploit this observation, and ﬁnally derive a result, in which it is no longer necessary
to add and subtract some line integral along a closed curve. However, for a time being it will be a
good exercise for the reader to try this technique, even if it later becomes unnecessary due to some
results in Ventus: Complex Functions Theory a-2.
Example 3.3.2 In this example we shall demonstrate one of the possible pitfalls by using an apparent
simple change of variable. We know from Theorem 2.5.1 that

|z|=1
1
z dz = 2πi.
On the other hand, we also have
1
z dz = 1
2 · 2z
z2 dz = 1
2
1
w dw,
w = z2,
so we should apparently have
(87) “2πi =

|z|=1
1
z dz = 1
2

|w|=1
1
w dw = 1
2 · 2πi = πi, ”
which obviously is wrong! In the present case it is easy to ﬁnd the error, because the curve
C :
|z| = 1,
i.e.
z = eiΘ,
Θ ∈[0, 2π],
is by the map w = z2 mapped into
C1 :
|w| = 1,
where w = e2iΘ = eiϕ,
ϕ = 2Θ ∈[0, 4π].
Hence, strictly speaking C1 = C + C circles twice around 0, so instead of (87) we should have
2πi =

|z|=1
1
z dz = 1
2

|w|=1
1
w dw + 1
2

|w|=1
1
w dw = 1
2 · 2 · 2πi = 2πi,
which is a true statement.
Of course one can change variable as above and analyze be image of the integration path. However,
for the untrained this is a dangerous procedure, so for the time being the reader is warned not to use
this procedure. ♦

Example 3.3.3 We shall compute the line integral

|z|=2
2z
z2 + 1 dz,
where the integrand is analytic except at the points ±i inside the integration curve C : |z| = 2.
We have just learned from Example 3.3.2 that one at this stage should avoid changing variable to e.g.
w = z2 + 1, even if
2z
z2 + 1 dz = 1
w dw,
and even it is possible to proceed this way by analyzing the image of the curve. Instead we recall the
old technique of decomposition of a rational function. In the present case we get

2z
(z + i)(z −i) =

where we have used that w1 = 0 lies inside |w1 −i| = 2, and w2 = 0 lies inside |w2 + i| = 2, and that
Example 3.3.1 allows us to deform the line integrals into line integrals along the unit circle.
We notice that if we instead use the deﬁnition itself of a complex line integral, i.e. apply that the
integration path has the following parametric description
z(t) = 2 eit,
t ∈[0, 2π],

It is possible, though not so easy in the latter case, to compute these trigonometric integrals by
methods from the real calculus. Cf. e.g. the Ventus: Calculus 1 series. Here we have found the result

The next result is an inverse to Cauchy’s integral theorem.
Theorem 3.3.3 Assume that f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is deﬁned in an open domain Ω, where u(x, y)
and v(x, y) are both of class C2 in the corresponding real variables (x, y).
If for every open simply connected subset Ω0 of Ωand for every closed piecewise diﬀerentiable curve
C in Ω0 we have
(88)

C
f(z) dz = 0,
then f(z) is an analytic function in Ω.
Remark 3.3.1 First note that the claim is true, if (88) holds for every closed curve C in the larger
set Ωitself, because this is a stronger requirement, which is not necessary. To see this, consider the
analytic function f(z) = 1
z in Ω= C \ {0}, which is not simply connected. The assumptions of
Theorem 3.3.3 are fulﬁlled for every simply connected subset Ω0 ⊂Ω, but not for the curve |z| = 1 in
Ω, in which case we already know that

|z|=1
1
z dz = 2πi ̸= 0.
♦
Proof. It suﬃces to prove Cauchy-Riemann’s equations at every point z0 ∈Ω. Choose an open
simply connected subset Ω0 ⊆Ω, such that z0 ∈Ω. Then by (88),

C
f(z) dz =

C
(u dx −v dy) + i

C
(v dx + u dy) = 0
for every closed curve C in Ω0. According to the real calculus (cf. e.g. the Ventus: Calculus 2 series)
this implies that the two real diﬀerential forms u dx −v dy and v dx + u dx are both exact, so there
exist C1 functions (actually indeﬁnite integrals) Φ(x, y) and Ψ(x, y) on Ω0, such that
u dx −v dy = dΦ = ∂Φ
∂x dx + ∂Φ
∂y dy,
and
v dx + u dy = dΨ = ∂Ψ
∂x dx + ∂Ψ
∂y dy.
when we identify the coeﬃcients of dx and dy we get
(89) u = ∂Φ
∂x ,
−v = ∂Φ
∂y ,
v = ∂Ψ
∂x ,
u = ∂Ψ
∂y .
By assumption, u and v are of class C1, hence Φ and Ψ are of class C2. In particular we can reverse
the order of diﬀerentiation, so it follows from (89) that

∂x = ∂

Figure 23: Adding and subtracting line integrals in the proof of Theorem 3.3.4.
The idea is just to add curve segments γ1 and −γ1, γ2 and −γ2 and the corresponding line integrals,
which sum up to 0. By cutting the curves C1 and C2 in the right way and adding the curve segments
above we obtain two closed curves, Γ1 and Γ2, on which we can use Cauchy’s integral theorem
for simply connected domains. We see that all curve segments are used just once, and that their
orientations match with Γ1, resp. Γ2. Thus

We used latently indeﬁnite integrals in the proof of Theorem 3.3.3. In fact, we found C2 functions Φ
and Ψ which by (89) satisﬁed Cauchy-Riemann’s equations, i.e.
F(z) := Φ(x, y) + iΨ(x, y)
is analytic, and we ﬁnd its derivative by (89),
F ′(z) = ∂Φ
∂x + i ∂Ψ
∂x = u + iv = f(z).
This leads to the following
Deﬁnition 3.3.1 Given an open connected subset Ωof C. Assume that f : Ω→C is a continuous
complex function. If we can ﬁnd an analytic function F : Ω→C, such that F ′(z) = f(z) for every
z ∈Ω, then F is called an indeﬁnite integral of f in Ω.
Note that we in Deﬁnition 3.3.1 only assume that f is continuous. We shall, however, later see that if f
has an indeﬁnite integral, then f is also analytic! In particular, f ′(z) exists, so in Complex Functions
Theory it is a very strong property of a function to have an indeﬁnite integral.

We shall in the following investigate more closely the properties of indeﬁnite integrals. We start with
the following simple lemma.
Lemma 3.3.1 Assume that an analytic function H : Ω→C satisﬁes H′(z) ≡0 in Ω. Then H is
constant in Ω.
Proof. Write H(z) = U(x, y) + iV (x, y), where U and V ∈C1(Ω). It follows from H being analytic
that
H′(z) = ∂U

where we have used Cauchy-Riemann’s equations. When we split into real and imaginary parts, we

and
∂V

In particular, U and V ∈C∞and dU = dV = 0. Choosing any z0 = x0 + iy0 ∈Ωand any curve C in
Ω, which starts at z0 and ends at z ∈Ω, we get by the usual methods from real calculus (cf. e.g. the
Ventus: Calculus 2 series),
U(x, y) −U (x0, y0) =

= 0,
hence U(x, y) = U (x0, y0) = k1 ∈R.
Similarly, V (x, y) = V (x0, y0) = k2 ∈R is a constant, and we conclude that
H(z) = U(x, y) + iV (x, y) = k1 + ik2 = k ∈C
is a constant. □
The theorem below follows immediately from Lemma 3.3.1,
Theorem 3.3.5 If F(z) is an indeﬁnite integral of the continuous and complex function f in Ω, then
the set of all indeﬁnite integrals is given by F(z) + c, where c ∈C is a constant.
Proof. It follows from
d
dz {F(z) + c} = F ′(z) + 0 = f(z),
that every F(z) + c indeed is an indeﬁnite integral.
Conversely, assume that F and G are two indeﬁnite integrals of f. Then H(z) := G(z) −F(z) is an
analytic function, and
H′(z) = G′(z) −F ′(z) = f(z) −f(z) = 0
in Ω.
According to Lemma 3.3.1 we have H(z) = G(z) −F(z) = c ∈C, from which follows that
G(z) = F(z) + c.

We conclude from Theorem 3.3.5 that if a continuous function f : Ω→C has an indeﬁnite integral,
then to every z0 ∈Ωand every c ∈C there is precisely one indeﬁnite integral F(z) of f(z), such that
F (z0) = c.
Theorem 3.3.6 Let f be a continuous function in an open and simply connected set Ω⊆C. Then f
has an indeﬁnite integral, if and only if the line integral along every closed and piecewise diﬀerentiable
curve C in Ωof the diﬀerential form f(z) dz is 0.
When this condition is fulﬁlled, then an indeﬁnite integral F of f is given by
F(z) =

C
f(ζ) dζ,
where C is any piecewise diﬀerentiable curve in Ωstarting at a ﬁxed point z0 ∈Ωand ending at the
variable point z ∈Ω.
Proof. Let us start by ﬁrst writing down the condition that F(z) = U(x, y)+iV (x, y) is an indeﬁnite
integral of f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y). This holds, if and only if U and V ∈C1(Ω) and – using that
F(z) is analytic –
F ′(z) = ∂U
∂x + i ∂V
∂x = ∂V
∂y −i ∂U
∂y = u + iv,
thus
∂U
∂x = ∂V
∂y = u,
∂V
∂x = −∂U
∂y = v.
This is again equivalent to U and V ∈C1(Ω) and
dU = u dx −v dy,
dV = v dx + u dy,
i.e. equivalent to the exactness of both diﬀerential forms u dx −v dy and v dx + u dy. Cf. e.g. the
Ventus: Calculus 2 series. Now, Ωis assumed to be simply connected, so this is by real calculus true
if and only if the real line integrals

C
{u dx −v dy}
and

C
{v dx + u dy}
only depend on the endpoints of C and not of the shape of C. Hence the line integral

C
f(z) dz =

C
{u dx −v dy} + i

C
{v dx + u dy}
does only depend on the endpoints of C, and we have proved the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
If f(z) = u + iv has an indeﬁnite integral, then u dx −v dy and v dx + u dy must be exact diﬀerential
forms. Fix z0 ∈Ωand deﬁne

Proof. Using Theorem 3.3.6, deﬁne the indeﬁnite integral
G(z) :=

C
f(z) dz,
where C goes from z1 to z, thus G (z1) = 0. Since F (z1) is a constant, F(z) −F (z1) is an indeﬁnite
integral, which also has the value 0 at z1. Hence they are equal, so
G(z) =

C
f(z) dz = F(z) −F (z1) .
Finally, choose z2 as the endpoint of C, and the theorem follows. □
Example 3.3.4 Let n ∈Z \ {−1}. Then F(z) =
1
n + 1 zn+1 is analytic in Ω= C for n ∈N0, and in
Ω= C \ {0} if n ≤−2.
Clearly, f(z) = F ′(z) = zn for z ∈Ω, so it follows from Theorem 3.3.7 that

for any closed curve in the domain of the integrand. Therefore, the only exception is n = −1, for

Example 3.3.5 It follows from Example 3.2.1 that the function f(z) = 1
z in the open and simply
connected domain Ω= C \ {R−∪{0}} has the principal logarithm Log z as an indeﬁnite integral.
Now, Log 1 = ln 1 + i · 0 = 0, so we get from Theorem 3.3.7 that

Cauchy’s integral formula
In Example 3.3.1 and Example 3.3.3 we used a rather clumsy method to compute line integrals of the
form

C f(z) dz, where f(z) is not deﬁned everywhere inside the curve C. It follows from Example 3.3.4
that

It does look like we might exploit this result in order to get a more streamlined solution procedure. This
is one of the ideas behind the following theorem, so one should not be surprised that this construction
occurs in the proof.

Theorem 3.4.1 Cauchy’ integral formula. Given an analytic function f(z) in an open domain Ω.
Let C be composed of simple closed and piecewise diﬀerentiable curves in Ωwith their orientations
chosen such that every point inside C belongs to Ω.
Let z0 ∈Ωbe any point inside C. Then
(90) f (z0) =
1
2πi

C
f(z)
z −z0
dz.
Remark 3.4.1 It is a strange phenomenon that the value of an analytic function f(z) at a point z0
inside C is expressed only by the values of f(z) on C and then of course by the point z0 itself. In
other words, if we only know the values of an analytic function f(z) on a closed curve C, then we
can reconstruct f(z) by (90) at every point inside C. This shows once more that the analyticity of a
function is a very strong property.
We should also mention that if z0 instead lies outside C, then
f(z)
z −z0
is analytic everywhere inside
and on C, so it follows from Theorem 3.3.4, i.e. Cauchy’s integral theorem for multiply connected
domains, that
1
2πi

C
f(z)
z −z0
dz = 0
for z0 outside C.
Therefore, (90) cannot be used to reconstruct f(z) outside the curve C. ♦
Proof. Let Ωdenote the open set inside C, i.e. Ωis bounded and has C as its boundary, and the
curve segments of C are oriented such that Ωlies to the left of C.
Let z0 ∈Ω. Since Ωis open, there exists an R > 0, such that
B (z0, R) = {z ∈C | |z −z0| < R} ⊆Ω.

Remark 3.4.2 Note that (95) is obtained from (90) by replacing z by ζ, and then z0 by z, and
ﬁnally diﬀerentiate the result under the integral sign with respect to z, which here is considered as a
parameter, because we integrate with respect to ζ. ♦

so f is n times complex diﬀerentiable at every z inside C.
Since n ∈N is arbitrary, f ∈C∞inside C, and f (n)(z), n ∈N, is given by (95).
Note that if n = 0, then (95) is reduced to (90).
Since Ωis an open domain, we can to every z ∈Ωﬁnd an r = rz > 0, such that B [z, rz] ⊂Ω. By
ﬁnally choosing C = Γr, we conclude that f ∈C∞in Ω. □
From Theorem 3.4.2 follows the following unexpected result, which again shows that being analytic is
really a strong property of a function.
Corollary 3.4.2 If a continuous function f has an indeﬁnite integral on an open domain Ω, then f
is analytic in Ω.
Proof. It follows from the assumption that there exists an analytic function F(z), such that
F ′(z) = f(z)
in Ω.
It follows from Theorem 3.4.2 that F(z) is diﬀerentiable of any order n ∈N, hence the same must be
true for f(z). In particular, f ′(z) is continuous, so f(z) is analytic. □
By Theorem 3.3.6 a continuous function f on an open and simply connected set Ωhas an indeﬁnite
integral, if and only if the line integral along any closed and piecewise diﬀerentiable curve C in Ωis 0.
We therefore obtain the following improvement of Theorem 3.3.3, where we no longer have to assume
that u and v are of class C1.
Theorem 3.4.3 Morera’s theorem. Let f : ω →C be continuous on the open domain Ω. If for every
open simply connected subset Ω0 ⊆Ωand every closed and piecewise diﬀerentiable curve C in Ω0,
(99)

C
f(z) dz = 0,
then f is analytic in Ω.
It is remarkable that even if we only assume that f is continuous, the assumption (99) for all such
curves C nevertheless implies that f is (complex) diﬀerentiable of every order n ∈N.
Morera’s theorem above then implies the next important result.

Theorem 3.4.4 (Karl Weierstraß, about 1860). Let (fn) be a sequence of analytic functions in an
open domain Ω. Assume that (fn) is uniformly convergent on every compact subset of Ω. Then the
limit function f is analytic in Ω, and the sequence (f ′
n) of its derivatives converges pointwise towards
f in Ω, and uniformly on every compact subset of Ω.
Remark 3.4.3 By repeating Theorem 3.4.4 we conclude under the given assumptions that for every
ﬁxed k ∈N, the sequence

f(k)
n

converges pointwise towards f (k) in Ω, and uniformly on every
compact subset of Ω. ♦
Proof. The real sequences {ℜfn} and {ℑfn} are uniformly convergent on every compact subset of
Ω, hence their limit functions, ℜf and ℑf, are both continuous on Ω, because every point (x, y) ∈Ω
is a also compact set. Thus, the complex limit function f exists and is continuous in Ω.

Choose any z0 ∈Ω, and then an R > 0, such that B [z0, R] ⊆Ω. Let Γr in general denote the circle

In the estimation of this diﬀerence we make the denominator smaller, |ζ −z| ≥R −r for all ζ ∈C
and all z ∈Γr. Thus,

(R −r)2 increases, when r(< R) increases.
Finally, let K be any compact subset of Ω. To every z ∈K there is an Rz > 0, such that B [z, Rz] ⊂Ω.
Putting rz = 1
2 Rz we see that {B (z, rz) | z ∈K} is an open covering of K. Then extract a ﬁnite
covering from this covering, i.e. there are ﬁnitely many points z1, . . . , z ∈K with (change of notation)
rzj = zj, such that
K ⊂

B [zj, rj] ⊂Ω.
It follows from the above that f ′
n(z) →f ′(z) uniformly for n →+∞on every B [zj, rj], hence also on
every ﬁnite union of such closed discs, and we have proved that the convergence is uniform on every
compact subset K of Ω. □
Theorem 3.4.4 is often applied on convergent series of analytic functions, where we must replace the
term fn by the n-th section sn := n
j=1 fj of the series. Then
Corollary 3.4.3 Let {fn} be a sequence of analytic functions on an open domain Ω. Assume that
the series
f(z) =

n=1
fn(z)
is pointwise convergent in Ω, and uniformly convergent on every compact subset of Ω. Then f(z) is
analytic in Ω, and f ′(z) is given by termwise diﬀerentiation of the series

f ′
n(z),
which is pointwise convergent in Ω, and uniformly convergent on every compact subset of Ω.
Proof. A series is (uniformly) convergent, if and only if its sectional sequence (sn) is (uniformly)

Remark 3.4.4 Roughly speaking, (101) and (102) mean that the sequence

of the deriva-
tives of an analytic function f at a point z0 cannot increase too much. This is contrasting the real
case, because there are functions f ∈C∞(R), which do not fulﬁll an analogue of (101), where we put
Mr = max {|f (x0 −r)| , |f (x0 + r)|} ,
r > 0.
Such real C∞functions cannot be extended to analytic functions, and we see once again that there
is a big diﬀerence between a real function being inﬁnitely often real diﬀerentiable, and a complex
function being inﬁnitely often complex diﬀerentiable. ♦

Simple applications in Hydrodynamics
Consider a non-compressible ﬂuid with a ﬂow over an open domain Ωof the (x, y) plane. The ﬂuid is
then described by its velocity ﬁeld −→
V (x, y), where we conventionally write
(103) −→
V (x, y) = (u, −v) = (u(x, y), −v(x, y)),
u, v ∈C1(Ω).
We notice the change of sign on the second component of −→
V . This will be explained later on.

Assume that there are neither sources nor sinks for the ﬂow in Ω. Then it follows by the classical
Gauß’s theorem for every subset ω ⊂Ωthat

By letting the domain ω shrink to the point (x, y) ∈Ωwe get by this limit process that

so the ﬁeld −→

It follows for such divergence free velocity ﬁelds of the type (103) that the ﬁrst one of Cauchy-
Riemann’s equations

is fulﬁlled. This is the reason for the choice of the sign in (103).

If the ﬁeld −→
V = (u, −v) is also rotation free, i.e.
−∂u
∂y −∂v
∂x = 0,
then the second one of Cauchy-Riemann’s equations is also satisﬁed in Ω.
Hence for a divergence free and rotation free velocity ﬁeld −→
V = (u, −v), the pair of functions (u, v)
satisﬁes Cauchy-Riemann’s equations, so the corresponding complex function
f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
is an analytic function.
Such ﬂows are called potential ﬂows, and we have proved
Theorem 3.5.1 Let −→
V = (u(x, y), −v(x, y)) be a C1 velocity ﬁeld, which is divergence free and rota-
tion free in an open domain Ωin the real plane. Then f(z) = u + iv is an analytic function in Ω.
Conversely, if f(z) = u + iv is analytic in Ω, then the ﬁeld −→
V := (u, −v) deﬁnes a divergence free and
rotation free ﬂow in Ω.
The application of any mathematical theory in any of the technical sciences may only be considered as
an ideal model of what really happens. The engineers must never forget the limitations of such models.
For instance, it will be very diﬃcult in practice to ﬁnd any ﬁeld which is rotation free. However, if
the ﬂow is very slow, one may still successfully make this assumption, which reduces the analysis
to Complex Functions Theory. Examples of such slow ﬂows are the ﬂow of water in the soil near a
network of drainpipes, or the diﬀusion of chloride ions into concrete pillars in salty waters.
However, even if the velocity ﬁeld is not rotation free, one may still in some cases get reasonable
results by assuming that this is the case. This was indeed the case in Joukowski’s ﬁrst investigation of
the velocity ﬁeld around a wing of an aeroplane, where no one would believe that the ﬂow is rotation
free. In spite of this fact, Joukowski obtained reasonable results.
If Ωis connected and the ﬁeld −→
V (x, y) = (u, −v) is divergence free and rotation free in Ω, then
Theorem 3.5.1 provides us with an analytic function f(z) = u + iv in Ω. 3mm
If Ωis also simply connected, then f(z) has an indeﬁnite integral F(z) which – apart from an arbitrary
complex constant – is uniquely determined,
(106) F(z) = ϕ(x, y) + iψ(x, y) + c,
c ∈C arbitrary.
Then we get by Cauchy-Riemann’s equations,
F ′(z) = ∂ϕ
∂x + i ∂ψ
∂x = ∂ϕ
∂x −i ∂ϕ
∂y = f(z) = u + iv,
thus
∂ϕ
∂x = u
and
∂ϕ
∂y = −v,
and whence

Due to the analysis above, the function ϕ(x, y) = ℜF(z) is also called the velocity potential of the
ﬂow, and the underlying analytic function F(x) [any indeﬁnite integral of f(z)] is called the complex
potential. It follows from
(108) F ′(z) = ∂ϕ
∂x + i ∂ϕ
∂y = u −iv ∼−→
V ,
that the complex conjugated of the derivative of a complex potential is equivalent to the velocity ﬁeld.
Finally, assuming that −→

This proves that the vector ﬁelds −−−→
grad ϕ and −−−→
grad ψ are perpendicular to each other at every point
(x, y), in which −→
V (x, y) ̸= −→0 .
The curves ϕ(x, y) = constant are called the equipotential curves or the potential lines of the ﬂow.
They are perpendicular to the velocity ﬁeld −−→
grad ϕ at every point, thus their tangent ﬁeld is given by
−−→
grad ψ.
The curves ψ(x, y) = constant are called the streamlines. They have the velocity ﬁeld −→

Some elementary analytic functions
In this chapter we review the simplest elementary analytic functions, namely the polynomials, the
rational functions, the exponential, and the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. These are also
the most important analytic functions, and they occur again and again in the applications.
4.1
Polynomials
A complex polynomial P(z) is a function of the form
(109) P(z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0,
z ∈C,
where a0, . . . , an are complex constants with the coeﬃcient an ̸= 0 of the term of largest n ∈N, where
we call this n ∈N the degree of the polynomial. Thus, the polynomials are ﬁnite linear combinations
of the simple power functions zk, k ∈N.
We add to the class of all polynomials the zero polynomial P(z) ≡0, in which case all the coeﬃcients
are zero, so the zero polynomial is formally not included in the deﬁnition above. It is customary to give
the zero polynomial the degree −∞. If we multiply two polynomials of degree m and n, respectively,
then the product is a polynomial of degree m + n. This is obvious for m > 0 and n > 0, and we see
that since n −∞= −∞it also holds if one of the polynomials is the zero polynomial.
We have already shown in Example 3.1.1 that zn is analytic with the derivative nzn−1 for n ∈N, and
that a constant c = c · z0 has 0 as its derivative. By the linearity described in Theorem 3.1.1 follows
that (109) is analytic with the obvious derivative
P ′(z) = nanzn−1 + (n −1)an−1zn−2 + · · · 2a2z + a1.
The most important result on polynomials is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which in one of its
forms states that any polynomial P(z) of degree n ∈N has precisely n roots, when these are counted
by their multiplicity. Hence, (109) can also be written as a factorization,
(110) P(z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0 = an (z −ζ1)p1 · · · (z −ζk)pk ,
where ζ1, . . . , ζk ∈C are the k diﬀerent roots of P(z), where the power pj ≥1 of (z −ζj)pj is the
multiplicity of the root ζk, and where p1 + · · · + pk = n is the degree of the polynomial.
We shall now prove this result. It will follow from
Theorem 4.1.1 Liouville’s Theorem. Every bounded analytic function deﬁned on all of C is a con-
stant.
Proof. Assume that f is analytic and bounded in C, e.g. |f(z)| ≤M for all z ∈C. Choose any
z0 ∈C and any r > 0. Then it follows from Cauchy’s inequalities that
|f ′ (z0)| ≤Mr · 1
r ≤M
r →0
for r →+∞.
The left hand side is independent of r, so we conclude that f ′(z) ≡0 everywhere in C, and it follows
from Lemma 3.3.1 that f(z) ≡c is constant. □

Theorem 4.1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Every polynomial P(z) of degree n ≥1 has
at least one root.
Remark 4.1.1 Theorem 4.1.2 is not the same version as the one mentioned above. The latter will
follow below in Corollary 4.1.1 as an easy consequence of Theorem 4.1.2. ♦
Proof. Assume that the polynomial P(z) of degree n ≥1 does not have a root. Then the reciprocal
f(z) :=

P(z) is analytic in all of C. We shall derive a contradiction.

zn →1
for z →∞,
so
|P(z)| →+∞
for z →∞,
and hence
f(z) =

P(z) →0
for z →∞.
It follows from the deﬁnition of convergence for z →∞that there exists an R, such that |f(z)| ≤1 for
|z| ≥R. Furthermore, the closed disc B[0, R] is compact, and |f(z)| is continuous and real, hence |f(z)|
has a maximum M in B[0, R]. Since C = B[0, R] ∪{C \ B[0, R]}, it follows that |f(z)| ≤max{M, 1}
in C, so f(z) is a bounded analytic function. Using Liouville’s theorem above it follows that f(z) is a
constant, which even must be zero, because we have proved already that f(z) →0 for z →∞. Hence,
f(z) ≡0 has degree −∞, contradicting the assumption that the degree was n ≥1. We therefore
conclude that P(z) has at least one root. □
Corollary 4.1.1 Every polynomial Pn(z) of degree n ≥1 has precisely n complex roots, counted by
their multiplicity.
Proof. We shall prove that we can write Pn(z) in the form (110). First it follows from the Funda-
mental Theorem of Algebra above that Pn(z) has at least one root ζ1. This means that ζ1 is a divisor
in Pn(z), so
Pn(z) = (z −ζ1) Pn−1(z),
where Pn−1(z) is a polynomial of degree n −1. Then repeat this process on Pn−1(z), etc.. After n
steps we have found precisely n roots and a (constant) polynomial P0(z) = an ̸= 0 of degree zero, and
(110) follows. □
Clearly, the polynomials form a very important class of analytic functions, and the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra also gives us the information of the number of roots.
Furthermore, we have
already in Section 1.5 given some methods of ﬁnding these roots, which are useful in the applications.
However, in general it is unfortunately not an easy task to ﬁnd even approximate values of the roots
of a polynomial of high degree, a problem which often occurs in engineering applications. There do
exist some long forgotten methods to ﬁnd these roots in general, but it will be too much to include
all these methods here.
The observation above is just one of the indications that polynomials may not be so easy to handle
as one would think at a ﬁrst glance. One could easily write a book on polynomials alone collecting
relevant and perhaps not so commonly known results for the practical applications in the engineering
sciences.

4.2
Rational functions
The rational functions are derived from the polynomials. Let P(z) and Q(z) be polynomials without
roots in common. Assume that P(z) is not the zero polynomial and that Q(z) is a polynomial of
degree ≥1.
A rational function f(z) is a quotient
(111) f(z) = P(z)
Q(z)
for z ∈{z ∈C | Q(z) ̸= 0}
of two polynomials as described above, so f(z) is deﬁned in C with the exception of the ﬁnite number
of roots of the denominator.
It follows immediately from Example 3.1.1 and Theorem 3.1.1 that a rational function is analytic, and
that its derivative is found as in the real case.
General linear fractional transformations
A special case of rational functions is given by the class of general linear fractional transformations,
also called M¨obius transformations. These have the structure
(112) f(z) := az + b
cz + d,
where

a
b
c
d

= ad −bc ̸= 0,
deﬁned in the set Ω= {z ∈C | cz + d ̸= 0}.
If c = 0, then d ̸= 0, and (112) is reduced to a polynomial of degree 1, which we include in this class,
and in which case Ω= C.
If instead c ̸= 0, then Ω=

z ∈C
 z ̸= −d
c

.
For completeness we notice that if

a
b
c
d
 = 0, then (a, b) and (c, d) are linearly dependent, and
since (c, d) ̸= (0, 0), there is a constant λ ∈C, such that a = λc and b = λc, so f(z) = λ is a constant.
This shows that the condition of the determinant in (112) is very natural.
We shall return to the general linear fractional transformations in Ventus: Complex Functions Theory
a-3.
Decomposition of rational functions
Every rational function f(z) = P(z)
Q(z), where P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials satisfying the usual
condition given above, can uniquely be decomposed into a sum of a polynomial and fractions of the
type cjk (z −ζk)−j, where (z −ζk)j is a divisor of Q(z). In the applications, such decompositions are
usually easier to handle than f(z) itself, so this shows again the importance of ﬁnding the roots of
the denominator Q(z).
Here we shall describe the procedure of decomposition, given that the denominator of degree m ≥1
is normed, i.e. the constant bm ≡1, and is factorized, i.e. it has the structure
(113) Q(z) = (z −ζ1)p1 · · · (z −ζk)pk ,
where p1, . . . , pk ∈N and p1 + · · · + pk = m.

Some elementary analytic functions
Let the numerator P(z) be of degree n, where we do not necessarily have to factorize P(z).
If n ≥m, then we ﬁrst divide P(z) by Q(z), giving
P(z) = P1(z)Q(z) + R(z),
where P1(z) is a polynomial of degree n−m, and the remainder R(z) has degree < m. This procedure
is well-known from high school, and it is also well-known that when we divide by Q(z) we uniquely
obtain
(114) P(z)
Q(z) = P1(z) + R(z)
Q(z).
We must here emphasize the importance ﬁrst separately to ﬁnd the polynomial in (114), because
otherwise we shall lose it by the following procedure, and the ﬁnal result becomes wrong.
Once the polynomial P1(z) has been found, we choose in the remaining part of the procedure the
simplest looking of the two polynomials P(z) and R(z) as they both will lead to the same result,
which will follow from the proof below.
First it follows from (114) and (113) that
(115) P(z)
Q(z) =
P(z)
(z −ζ1)p1 · · · (z −ζk)pk = P1(z) +
R(z)
(z −ζ1)p1 · · · (z −ζk)pk .
We multiply (115) by one of the maximal factors in the denominator, e.g. (z −ζ1)p1. Then
(116) (z −ζ1)p1 P(z)
Q(z) =
P(z)
(z −ζ2)p2 · · · (z −ζk)pk = P1(z) · (z −ζ1)p1 +
R(z)
(z −ζ2)p2 · · · (z −ζk)pk .
Clearly, the right hand side of (116) is analytic at z = ζ1, so we get by taking the limit z →ζ1,
(117) lim
z→ζ1 (z −ζ1)p1 · P(z)
Q(z) =
P (ζ1)
(ζ1 −ζ2)p2 · · · (ζ1 −ζk)pk =
R (ζ1)
(ζ1 −ζ2)p2 · · · (ζ1 −ζk)pk := a1p1.
In particular, P (ζ1) = R (ζ1), proving that we shall always get the right coeﬃcient a1P1, no matter if
we choose P(z) or R(z) from the beginning.
We have found a1p1 above. We claim that it is the coeﬃcient of (z −ζ1)−p1 in the decomposition. To
see this we add and subtract the term a1p1 (z −ζ1)−p1 to get
P(z)
Q(z)
=
P1(z) +
a1p1
(z −ζ1)p1 +
R(z)
(z −ζ1)p1 · (z −ζk)pk −

(z −ζ1)p1 + R(z) −a1p1 (z −ζ1)p2 · · · (z −ζk)pk
(z −ζ1)p1 · · · (z −ζk)pk
.
(118)
We notice in the latter fraction that the numerator
R(z) −a1p1 (z −ζ1)p2 · · · (z −ζk)pk
by (117) is a polynomial which is zero for z = ζ1. Hence
R(z) −a1p1 (z −ζ1)p1 · · · (z −ζk)pk = R1(z) · (z −ζ1)

(z −ζ1)p1−1 (z −ζ2)p2 · · · (z −ζk)pk .
Then repeat the procedure of (116), (117) and (118) on (119) with a multiplication by successively
(z −ζ1)p1−1, . . . , then (z −ζ2)p2, . . . , (z −ζk)pk, · · · . After a ﬁnite number of steps we have obtained

and then subtract this block from the quotient P(z)
Q(z , followed by a reduction. The result has the
structure
˜P(z)
(z −ζ1)p1−1 (z −ζ2)p2−1 · · · (z −ζk)pk−1 ,
so the degree of the denominator has been decreased by k.
In one important special case, when all the roots of Q(z) are simple, i.e. p1 = · · · = pm = 1, the
decomposition becomes particular simple.
Theorem 4.2.1 Assume that Q(z) = (z −ζ1) · · · (z −ζm) has only simple roots and that the degree
of the polynomial P(z) is < m. Then the decomposition of P(z)
Q(z) is given by

Q(z) =

Proof. We know already that the decomposition has the structure
P(z)
Q(z) =

Now, Q (ζj) = 0, so following (117) the coeﬃcient aj is given by

z→ζj P(z) ·

We clearly run into a terrible mess of calculations if we just proceed according to the standard
procedure. If we instead notice that ζ4

Example 4.2.2 We shall in this example and later also in Example 4.2.3 and Example 4.2.4 decom-
pose

a1
z −1 + a21
z −i + a31
z + i +
a22
(z −i)2 +
a32
(z + i)2 ,
in three diﬀerent ways.
In all three cases a1, corresponding to the simple real root, is found by
multiplying by z −1 and then taking the limit z →1, thus
a1 = 2.
Furthermore, it follows by a complex conjugation that a21 = a32 and a22 = a32. It therefore suﬃces
to ﬁnd a21 and a22.
If we multiply by (z −i)2 and then let z →i, we get
a22 =
8
(i −1)(i + i)2 =
8(−1 −i)
(2i)2(i −1)(−i −1) = 8(−1 −i)
−4 · 2
= 1 + i,
so
a32 = a22 = 1 −i.

Notice that we in this computation always collect terms that are more or less “like each other”, and
then reduce partially. In particular, we start by getting rid of the factor z −1 in the denominator by
just pairing two terms without involving the remainder, and then reduce.
Finally, it follows from Theorem 4.2.1 that
a21 = −2 · z + 2
2z

z=i
= −1 + 2i,
so a31 = a21 = −1 −2i,

Decomposition formula for multiple roots in the denominator.
We saw in Example 4.2.2 that when the roots of the denominator are not all simple, then it could
be fairly diﬃcult to decompose the rational function. On the other hand, Theorem 4.2.1 showed that
when all roots of the denominator indeed are simple, then (121) provides us with a simple formula for
this decomposition. We shall in this subsection demonstrate that we have a similar, though of course
also more complicated formula for the decomposition in case of multiple roots.
Theorem 4.2.2 Assume that P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials, and that α is a root of Q(z), i.e.
(122) Q(z) = (z −α)nQ1(z),
where
Q1(α) ̸= 0 and n ∈N.
Then in the decomposition of f(z) = P(z)
Q(z) occurs in particular the “block”
(123)
a1
z −α +
a2
(z −α)2 + · · · +
an
(z −α)n
corresponding to the root α of multiplicity n.
The coeﬃcients a1, . . . , an of (123) are given by
(124) aj =
1
(n −j)! lim
z→α
dn−j

(n −j)! lim
z→α

 P(z)
Q1(z)

,
where Q1(z) is deﬁned by (122).
Remark 4.2.1 If n = 1, then α is a simple root, so we have already Theorem 4.2.1. We shall show
that the two results are the same. Using (124) we get
a1 =
1
(1 −1)! lim
z→α

z→0
P(z)

Q′(α) = P(α)
Q1(α),
and we get the same result. ♦

Q1(z) = an + an−1(z −α) + · · · + a1(z −α)n−1 + (z −α)nr(z).
It follows immediately by letting z →α in (125) that
an = lim

which clearly is (124) for j = n.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (126) is clearly 0, because the polynomial between the brackets
is of degree < n −j. The value of the second term is (n −j)! aj, so it is a constant not depending on
z, while the third term after the diﬀerentiations contains a factor z −α, which tends towards 0 for

so even if this (real) method is more diﬃcult that the complex ones, we can succeed also with this
procedure. ♦
Remark 4.2.2 Some readers may wonder, why we have spent a whole section on decomposition,
“instead of letting the computer do it!” The reason is that according to the author’s experience there
are still problems with these decompositions programmes on the computer. Sometimes one may even
get some very strange results. Therefore, this section has been included as an alternative, if anything
else goes wrong. ♦
4.3
The exponential
We have already introduced the exponential exp : C →C in Deﬁnition 1.2.1 on page 13 by
(129) exp z = exp(x + iy) := ex cos y + i ex sin y,
z ∈C.
We proved that it fulﬁls the functional equation (10), i.e.
(130) exp(z + w) = exp z · exp w,
for z, w ∈C.
We shall for convenience usually use the slightly incorrect notation ez instead of exp z. That this is
incorrect will ﬁrst be explained in Ventus: Complex Functions Theory a-3, and for the time being
there will be no risk of misunderstanding the symbol.
We proved in Theorem 3.1.4 that the exponential ez is analytic in C and that its derivative is given
by
(131)
d
dz ez = ez.
Now, ex > 0 for every x ∈R, and
eiy =

cos2 y + sin2 y = 1, so |ez| =
exeiy = ex > 0 for every
z = x + iy ∈C, and we have proved that 0 /∈exp C.
Conversely, we shall now prove that the range exp C = C \ {0}, so 0 is the only point in C which does
not lie in the range of exp.
Let us ﬁrst check the special equation ez = 1. Since |ez| = ex = 1, we get x = 0, thus z = iy, and it
is well-known that
eiy = cos y + i sin y = 1,
if and only if
y = 2pπ,
p ∈Z.
We conclude that the solution set of the equation ez = 1 is {2ipπ | p ∈Z}.
Then choose any a = r eiΘ ∈C \ {0}, given by its polar coordinates r > 0 and Θ ∈R. We shall ﬁnd
the complete solution of the equation ez = a. When this equation is divided by r eiΘ = a ̸= 0, it
follows that it has precisely the same set of solutions as the equation
exp{z −ln r −iΘ} = 1,
which was solved above, hence
(132) z −ln r −iΘ = 2ipπ,
or
z = ln r + i{Θ + 2pπ},
p ∈Z.

This shows that C \ {0} ⊆exp C ⊆C \ {0}, i.e. exp C = C \ {0} as claimed above.
When a = r eiΘ ̸= 0, it was proved in Section 1.2 and Example 3.2.1 that Θ ∈R above can be chosen
uniquely as a principal argument in the interval ] −π, π], and for this Θ ∈] −π, π] we have
ln r + iΘ = Log a,
for a ∈C \ {0},
where the principal logarithm Log was introduced in Example 3.2.1. Then it follows from (132) that
Theorem 4.3.1 If a ∈C \ {0}, then all solutions of the equation ez = a are given by
(133) z = Log a + 2ipπ,
p ∈Z.
Remark 4.3.1 the (principal) logarithm is not an elementary analytic function, so apart from The-
orem 4.3.1 above we shall not go further into the properties of the logarithm.
We postpone this
discussion to Ventus: Complex Functions Theory a-3. ♦

The trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
In Complex Functions Theory the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions “are more or less the same”,
in the sense that e.g.
sin(iz) = i sinh z
and
cos(iz) = cosh z,
so it would formally be suﬃcient just to stick to one set of functions, e.g. the trigonometric functions.
It is, however, convenient to use all the usual notations from the real also in the complex, even if we
have two diﬀerent symbols describing the same.
First note that ez for z ∈C was deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.2.1 (and reviewed in Section 4.3) by means of
the real exponential ex and the real trigonometric functions cos y and sin y.
We shall below deﬁne the complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions by means of the complex
exponential ez. This means that we ﬁnally shall check if we have not made a notational mess, i.e. we
shall show that for z = x real the deﬁnitions give the same functions.
Deﬁnition of the complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
We deﬁne for z ∈C the complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions by
(134)

cosh z := ez + e−z
2
.
It follows from e.g. Theorem 3.1.1 that they are all analytic in C, and it follows immediately that

Clearly, the deﬁnitions of sinh x and cosh x are the same for the two deﬁnitions, when z = x ∈R is
real. Concerning the trigonometric functions we use that eix = cos x + i sin x for z = x ∈R,
“ sin z” = 1

and
“ cos z” = 1

eix + ei(−x)
= 1
2 {(cos x + i sin x) + (cos x −i sin x)} = cos x,
so the two “diﬀerent” deﬁnitions agree for z = x ∈R.
Example 4.4.1 The following is only a small exercise in the deﬁnitions above in order to become
accustomed to these new functions. We shall compute the complex value of cos(−i) and sin(1 + i)
Using (134) we get

It follows from (134) that
sin(iz) = e−z −ez
2i

cos(iz) = e−z + ez
2

sinh(iz) = eiz −e−iz
2

2i
= i sin z,
cosh(iz) = eiz + e−iz

so we have proved the transition formulæ
(136)



sinh(iz) = i sin z,
sin(iz) = i sinh z,
cosh(iz) = cos z,
cos(iz) = cosh z.
It also follows from (134) that like in the real case,
(137) eiz = cos z + i sin z,
ez = cosh z + sinh z.
In particular, eiy = cos y + i sin y is not just valid for y ∈R, but for all complex y = z ∈C.
Using the elementary analytic functions above we deﬁnethe following “new” analytic functions, when-
ever the denominator is ̸= 0,
(138)







tan z := sin z
cos z ,
cot z := cos z
sin z ,
tanh z := sinh z
cosh z ,
coth z := cosh z
sinh z .
Whenever z is real, these deﬁnitions agree with the usual ones. However, when z ∈C \ R we of course
lose our usual geometric interpretation of the trigonometric functions. Instead we may consider these
new eight analytic functions as natural (analytic) extensions of the well-known real functions, on
which we in the future can use the properties of analytic functions.
From (136) we immediately get the following formulæ,
(139)



tan(iz) = i tanh z,
cot(iz) = −i coth z,
tanh(iz) = i tan z,
coth(iz) = −i cot z.

Using (137) we get
cosh2 z −sinh2 = (cosh z + sinh z)(cosh z −sinh z) = ez · e−z = e0 = 1,
and
cos2 z + sin2 z = (cos z + i sin z)(cos z −i sin z) = eiz · e−iz = e0 = 1,
hence, for all z ∈C,
(140) cos2 z + sin2 z = 1
and
cosh2 z −sinh2 = 1.

Proof. The proofs of these formulæ all follow the same pattern, so we shall only prove the ﬁrst one,

It follows trivially from Theorem 4.4.1 that we have the following estimates on the unit disc.
Corollary 4.4.1 If |z| ≤1, then

| sinh z| ≤cosh 1,

Zeros of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
It was proved in Section 4.3 that ez did not have any zero. The complex trigonometric functions must
of course have at least all their usual real zeros. We shall now prove that these are indeed all zeros in
C.
Theorem 4.4.2 The zeros of the analytic functions sin z, cos z, sinh z and cosh z are given by
sin z = 0
for z = pπ,
p ∈Z,
cos z = 0
for z = π
2 + pπ,
p ∈Z,
sinh z = 0
for z = ipπ,
p ∈Z,
cosh z = 0
for z = i

Proof. Assume that
sin z = 1

We have proved that 1
2i e−iz ̸= 0 for all z ∈C, so this equation is fulﬁlled, if and only if e2iz = 1 = e2ipπ,
p ∈Z, hence if and only if z = pπ, p ∈Z, and we have proved the ﬁrst statement.
From cos z = sin

and the proof above follow that cos z = 0, if and only if π
2 −z = −pπ,
p ∈Z, or by a rearrangement, for z = π
2 + pπ, p ∈Z.
From (136) follows that sinh z = −i sin(iz) = 0, if and only if iz = −pπ, p ∈Z, i.e. for z = ipπ, p ∈Z.
Finally, it follows from (136) that cosh z = cos(iz) = 0, if and only if iz = −π
2 −pπ, p ∈Z, i.e. for
z = i
