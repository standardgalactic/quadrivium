INTRODUCTION
•	
As of Jan 2016, 451 Research identified over 275 vendors and products in the data platform and analytics 
landscape. Growth is expected, as is convergence of data platforms.
•	
Convergence or the ‘blending’ of data management platforms is being driven by
1.	 Different data types - the need to adapt some data stored in different types of databases
2.	 Operational efficiencies - reducing maintenance by converging multiple data silos into one
3.	 Demands of variable workloads – some data stores are better at addressing certain types of applications and 
their workloads
•	
Open source technology is increasingly used in the growing complexity of Big Data environment projects. 
Although able to handle scale and complexity of the new modern data types, a converged data platform allows 
it all to be delivered on a unified platform, providing centralized management, security, high availability, fault 
tolerance and disaster recovery.
DEFINITION
•	
A converged data platform is the convergence or blending of two or more processes, frameworks or technology - 
coming together in a unified whole.
IMPORTANT DATA
•	
By 2019 it is anticipated that the value created in the Hadoop, Event/Stream processing, New SQL and NoSQL 
market will be about $10b. Open source Hadoop will account for about $3.6b and NoSQL some $4.7b. 451 
Research expect continued growth in this market.
KEY POINTS
•	
NoSQLs emergence, growth and appeal have been attributed to its different data stores for different workloads 
(polyglot persistence). However, limitations of operational complexity and inflexibility from multiple databases 
driving applications have been addressed by the growth of multi-model databases - which support a combination 
of various NoSQL data models. NoSQL’s future is predicted to rest with this approach.
•	
With increasing complexity in data workloads, a number of actions and data sets get joined at many management 
points that require different consoles, different hardware utilization, different demands for security and different 
fault tolerance and disaster recovery. These concepts drive the creation of a converged data platform.
•	
In the past operational and analytical data workloads were more or less separated. Today they often are not and 
this demands data convergence.

Open Source Big Data Projects - Emergence of the Converged Data Platform
KEY POINTS (cont.)
•	
Convergence is also being driven by the idea that some in-memory databases can also serve as memory caches. 
Thus platforms are being developed that can run a database with a cache or simply as a cache solution.
•	
The expansion of streaming technology has opened up yet another area for convergence where diverse 
applications are being developed to serve expanding demands for analysis of real-time data streams.
•	
Total Data Warehouse is a term used by 451 Research to describe all the components that make data platform 
convergence possible.
BUSINESS BENEFITS
•	
Converged data platforms are transforming businesses, demonstrating significant cost savings and helping drive 
additional revenues. Six cases studies are cited by MapR in their recent webinar with 451 Research.
•	
The key benefits of a converged data platform:
1.	 It’s in real time with reduced latency - improves responsiveness of applications 
2.	 Improved reliability drives greater business value and reduced costs
•	
Converging data technologies in one place creates between 30% to 50% reduction in the overall total cost of 
ownership. Savings are evident on the type of hardware utilized, the data center, operating costs, and reduced 
costs of data movement.
•	
In a survey of MapR customers, it was reported that 98% were running more than one application on a single 
cluster and 18% were running over 50 applications.
TRENDS
•	
Different data types (structured, unstructured), operational efficiencies (converging multiple silos of data) and 
variable workloads (dependant on applications)  are all driving convergence of data storage platforms.
•	
NoSQL and SQL vendors are starting to adopt certain traits of each other. For example, IBM and Oracle are adding 
JSON capabilities to their databases, searchable by SQL. NoSQL vendors are adding SQL querying capabilities. 
This trend illustrates NoSQL and SQL convergence.
•	
Operational and analytical data workloads are starting to converge. Until recently, separate databases have been 
used for each. Emerging databases take advantage of in-memory and advanced processing to deliver combined 
operational and analytical processing.
•	
Several NoSQL players, among them MapR, have taken up the multi-model approach and it is anticipated that this 
is the future direction of this sector.
•	
Hadoop based convergence is taking place in 
1.	 Cache  (Apache Geode, Apache Ignite) 
2.	 Operational databases (NoSQL) - (MapR-DB, Apache HBase, Splice Machine, Apache Trafodian) 
3.	 Analytic databases, made possible by connectors, SQL-on-Hadoop, Federated query - (e.g. Pivotal, Teradata 
and IBM)

TRENDS (cont.)
•	
Convergence is also occurring with cache and grid databases where databases can be run with a cache or used 
as a pure cache solution.
•	
Customers’ growing need for more frequent analysis of real-time data streams is pushing data stream processing 
into the mainstream. The blending of streaming technologies (e.g. Storm, Spark, Kafka and MapR Streams) with 
Hadoop illustrate the convergence in this space.
•	
JSON is an extremely popular format among application developers and it is emerging as a de facto standard for 
storing data, particularly around the growth of sensors for IoT use cases.
•	
OJAI (Open JSON Application Interface) is seen by MapR as an emerging standard for managing JSON data 
access across the entire data platform, whether that is the database itself, streams or file systems.
MapR’S OFFERING 
(Key points on company offering made by MapR in the webinar)
•	
MapR provides the industry’s only converged data platform that integrates the power of Hadoop and Spark with 
global event streaming, real-time database capabilities, and enterprise storage, enabling customers to harness 
the enormous power of their data. Organizations with the most demanding production needs, including sub-
second response for fraud prevention, secure and highly available data-driven insights for better healthcare, 
petabyte analysis for threat detection, and integrated operational and analytic processing for improved customer 
experiences, run on MapR.
•	
MapR’s approach is to be as open as possible in supporting as many of the API’s as possible. One of the very 
popular features of MapR’s converged data platform is the seamless movement of data and files through drag 
and drop without having to write special code to batch-load data into and out of a Hadoop environment.
•	
MapR’s converged data platform brings together open source engines and tools (e.g, Hadoop, Spark, Apache Drill) 
and can also support commercial engines and applications (e.g. Vertica, SAP, MySQL).
•	
MapR’s converged data platform handles multi-model databases. JSON is a recently added standard native 
format on which applications can also be built. MapR is completely integrated with Hadoop and can operate 
across datacenters in a multi-master type of environment and setup.
•	
In the area of security management across a big data environment, MapR has pushed down access control to the 
granular level. This access control can be spread across different processing engines and all types of structured 
data, files, tables and streams.
•	
The MapR system is a multi-tenant environment supporting many different applications on a single cluster.
•	
In realtime applications, MapR’s data platform allows a single system to operate simultaneously with data-at-rest 
and data-at-motion reducing latency.
•	
MapR’s converged data permits an optimized table setup and streaming working directly with storage hardware 
resources. It operates natively against the hardware allowing fast, efficient, direct I/O on that system, thereby 
improving performance.
