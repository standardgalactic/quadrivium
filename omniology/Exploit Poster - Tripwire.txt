What is a loadable kernel module? 
Loadable kernel modules are intended as an easier way of 
adding kernel functionality, to avoid having to recompile the 
kernel every time new functionality is added. The problem is 
that most kernel modules are loaded and run merely by copying 
the object file into a specified directory, with full privilege and 
control. Malicious code is often injected into kernels by adding 
new kernel modules and rebooting the machine.
What is change control?
Often, the largest threats to system stability and 
security are introduced by unauthorized changes, 
or the unexpected side effects of authorized changes. 
Change control is a compensating control to reduce or
restrict these risks. In mission-critical environments, 
change control is often based on a workflow that 
requires documenting requested changes, getting 
authorization from an authorized party and then 
implementing the authorized work order. However, 
change control can be as simple as announcing 
changes before you make them, and archiving those 
announcements.     
What are 'repeatable builds'?
Mission-critical functions must be able to survive the 
failure or destruction of the infrastructure that runs them.  
Unfortunately, years of undocumented and uncontrolled 
changes often make it impossible to reconstruct critical 
servers, routers, databases, etc. Worse, the only time 
you learn this is when that system has been irrevocably 
compromised, corrupted, or degraded and no source of 
the "known good state" exists. Repeatable builds ensure 
that all servers can be duplicated and provisioned from 
scratch. Many organizations never make changes directly 
on production systems, but make changes to the build 
process, ensuring that changes jeopardize repeatable 
builds. (Also often called "provisioning.")   
What is 'compensating control'?
Procedures for management to periodically verify existence 
of segregation of duties. Whenever a computer-based process 
involves sensitive, valuable, or critical information, the system 
must include controls involving a separation of duties.
What is a buffer overflow?
Software bugs exist which allow user-supplied
buffers to overwrite the process stack. In this
case, the program either crashes, or executes
code contained in the user's buffer. In the latter
case it is possible to trick the computer into
executing arbitrary code and obtaining remote
root access. This is perhaps the most common
type of bug, and potentially the most deadly.
Buffer overflows are difficult to detect or prevent
during software design. While the demand for
more and varied software is ever increasing,
the chance of software bugs also increases.
What is spoofing?
The TCP/IP protocol has no authentication 
mechanisms. What this means is that anyone 
can create a 'fake' packet and impersonate 
someone else. Specifically, this means creating 
a fake IP address. Many attacks can be executed 
using spoofed packets. Even if a victim logs all of 
the packets and uses intrusion-detection software, 
the source of a spoofed packet is next to impossible 
to determine. This makes catching the attacker
very difficult. Additionally, some software relies 
upon the source address of the IP packet for 
authentication. Because IP can be spoofed, the 
program in question can sometimes be fooled into
allowing access, running commands, etc. 
What is excess privilege?
Sometimes software will be installed or run with 
too much power. An example might be a public 
server daemon running as 'root' (or SYSTEM in 
the case of Windows NT). Since processes are 
complex and always have the potential of being 
exploited, administrators should 'close the window 
of trust' and give processes only the power that they
need to function. Anything in excess only increases 
the risk of total system compromise if the process 
is exploited.
What is hijacking?
Because of the weaknesses of TCP/IP, 
it is vulnerable to spoofing and hijacking. 
Hijacking describes a special type of 
spoofed IP attack. Normal TCP commun-
ications take place over a 'session.' If the 
session can be sniffed, or the sequence 
numbers can be guessed, the session 
can be 'hijacked.' The attacker can insert
spoofed packets into the session stream 
and cause commands to be run as the 
original user.
What is a rootkit?
A rootkit is a set or trojan horse 
programs that can be installed on 
a computer. These programs allow 
the attacker to hide processes, files, 
and logins from the system admin-
istrator. Furthermore, these programs
usually leave back doors within the 
system. It is important to use integrity 
assessment tools to make sure that 
files have not been replaced, otherwise 
a rootkit can be very hard to detect.
What is a trojan horse?
An attacker may be able to replace certain 
programs and shared libraries. The replace-
ment program is usually called a trojan horse. 
The trojan horse may emulate the original 
program so that the replacement goes 
undetected. The trojan may be able to sniff 
passwords, provide back door access, and 
even hide other programs from the system.
