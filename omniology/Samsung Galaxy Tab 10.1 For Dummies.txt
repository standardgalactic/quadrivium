About the Author
Dan Gookin has been writing about technology for over 20 years. He com­
bines his love of writing with his gizmo fascination to create books that are 
informative, entertaining, and not boring. Having written more than 120 titles 
with millions of copies in print translated into over 30 languages, Dan can 
attest that his method of crafting computer tomes seems to work.
Perhaps his most famous title is the original DOS For Dummies, published in 
1991. It became the world’s fastest-selling computer book, at one time moving 
more copies per week than the New York Times #1 bestseller (though as a 
reference, it could not be listed on the NYT Bestseller list). From that book 
spawned the entire line of For Dummies books, which remains a publishing 
phenomenon to this day.
Dan’s most popular titles include PCs For Dummies, Droid X For Dummies, 
Word For Dummies, and Laptops For Dummies. He also maintains the vast and 
helpful website, www.wambooli.com.
Dan holds a degree in Communications/Visual Arts from the University of 
California, San Diego. Presently, he lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he 
enjoys spending time with his sons playing video games inside while they 
watch the gentle woods of Idaho.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 For Dummies 

Introduction
I

t’s not a cell phone. It’s not a computer. It’s the latest craze: the tablet. It 
exists somewhere between the traditional computer and the newfangled 
smart phone. That makes the tablet kind of an oddball, but quite a popular 
oddball.
The Galaxy Tab is Samsung’s solution to your mobile, wireless, communica­
tions, information, and entertainment needs. Oh, I could blather on and on 
about how wonderful it is, but my point is simple: The Galaxy Tab does so 
much, but it comes with such scant documentation that you would merely 
have to sneeze into the obligatory Master Your Device pamphlet and the thing 
would be ruined.
Anyone wanting more information about how to get the most from the Galaxy 
Tab needs another source. This book is that source.
About This Book
This book was written to help you get the most from the Galaxy Tab’s mas­
sive potential. It’s a reference. Each chapter covers a specific topic, and the 
sections within each chapter address an issue related to the topic. The over­
all idea is to show how things are done on the Galaxy Tab and to help you get 
the most from the Tab without overwhelming you with information or intimi­
dating you into despair.
Sample sections in this book include
	
✓	Making a home for the Tab
	
✓	Attaching your Google account to the Galaxy Tab
	
✓	Importing contacts from your computer
	
✓	Reading an e-mail message
	
✓	Running Facebook on your Galaxy Tab
	
✓	Talking and video chat
	
✓	Making a Skype phone call
	
✓	Doing a panoramic shot
	
✓	Galaxy Tab travel tips

Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 For Dummies 
You have nothing to memorize, no sacred utterances or animal sacrifices, 
and definitely no PowerPoint presentations. Instead, every section explains a 
topic as though it’s the first thing you read in this book. Nothing is assumed, 
and everything is cross-referenced. Technical terms and topics, when they 
come up, are neatly shoved to the side, where they’re easily avoided. The 
idea here isn’t to learn anything. This book’s philosophy is to help you look it 
up, figure it out, and get on with your life.
How to Use This Book
This book follows a few conventions for using the Galaxy Tab. First of all, 
the Galaxy Tab is referred to as the Galaxy Tab throughout the book. I might 
also break down and call it the Tab for short, just because, for some reason, 
typing the word Galaxy isn’t the easiest thing for me.
The way you interact with the Galaxy Tab is by using its touchscreen, the 
glassy part of the device as it’s facing you. The device also has some physical 
buttons, as well as some holes and connectors. All those items are described 
in Chapter 1.
There are various ways to touch the screen, which are explained and named 
in Chapter 3.
Chapter 4 discusses text input on the Galaxy Tab, which involves using an 
onscreen keyboard. You can also input text by speaking to the Galaxy Tab, 
which is also covered in Chapter 4.
This book directs you to do things by following numbered steps. Each step 
involves a specific activity, such as touching something on the screen; for 
example:
	
3.	Choose Downloads.
This step directs you to touch the text or item labeled Downloads on the 
screen. You might also be told to do this:
	
3.	Touch Downloads.
	
	 Some options can be turned off or on, as indicated by a gray box with a green 
check mark in it, as shown in the margin. By touching the box on the screen, 
you add or remove the green check mark. When the green check mark 
appears, the option is on; otherwise, it’s off.

3
 Introduction
	
	 The barcodes in the margins are there to help you install recommended 
apps. They’re properly known as QR codes, which describes that type of 
square barcode. To install the app, scan the QR code using barcode reader 
software you install on the Galaxy Tab. Chapter 16 discusses how to add soft­
ware, or apps, on the Tab. One of the first apps you get should be a barcode 
reader. I use the Barcode Scanner app.
Foolish Assumptions
Even though this book is written with the gentle hand-holding required by 
anyone who is just starting out, or who is easily intimidated, I’ve made a few 
assumptions. For example, I assume that you’re a human being and not the 
emperor of Jupiter.
My biggest assumption: You have a Samsung Galaxy Tab of your own. 
Though you could use this book without owning a Galaxy Tab, I think the 
people in the Phone Store would grow tired of you reading it while standing 
in front of the demo model.
There is more than one Galaxy Tab gizmo available. The device covered in 
this book is the Galaxy Tab 10.1, both the cellular data and Wi-Fi versions. 
The cellular version is available from Verizon, and potentially from other pro­
viders in the near future.
This book doesn’t cover the original 7-inch Galaxy Tab, though there is a 
separate For Dummies title specific to that device.
The Wi-Fi Galaxy Tab uses standard computer wireless networking to com­
municate with the Internet. I call it the Wi-Fi Tab. The Galaxy Tab sold by 
Verizon uses the digital cellular network to communicate with the Internet, as 
well as Wi-Fi. I refer to it as the cellular Galaxy Tab.
Only a few subtle differences between the Wi-Fi and cellular Galaxy Tabs 
exist, and those are noted in the text. Otherwise, whenever I write Galaxy Tab 
or Tab, the text refers to both models. 
I also assume that you have a computer, either a desktop or laptop. The 
computer can be a PC or Windows computer or a Macintosh. Oh, I suppose 
it could also be a Linux computer. In any event, I refer to your computer as 
“your computer” throughout this book. When directions are specific to a PC 
or Mac, the book says so.
Programs that run on the Galaxy Tab are apps, which is short for applications. 
A single program is an app.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 For Dummies 
Finally, this book doesn’t assume that you have a Google account, but 
already having one helps. Information is provided in Chapter 2 about setting 
up a Google account — an extremely important part of using the Galaxy Tab. 
Having a Google account opens up a slew of useful features, information, and 
programs that make using your Tab more productive.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five parts, each of which covers a certain aspect of 
the Galaxy Tab or how it’s used.
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands
This part of the book is an introduction to the Galaxy Tab. Chapters cover 
setup and orientation to familiarize you with how the device works. It’s a 
good place to start if you’re completely new to the concept of tablet comput­
ing, mobile devices, or the Android operating system.
Part II: The Communications Tab
In this part of the book, you read about various ways that the Galaxy Tab can 
electronically communicate with your online friends. There’s texting, e-mail, 
the web, social networking, and even the much-wanted trick of using the non­
phone Galaxy Tab to make phone calls and do video chat.
Part III: The Everything Tab
The Galaxy Tab is pretty much a limitless gizmo. To prove it, the chapters in 
this part of the book cover all the various and wonderful things the Tab does: 
It’s an eBook reader, a map, a navigator, a camera, a video recorder, a picture 
book, a portable music player, a calendar, and potentially so much more.
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts
Part IV of this book covers a lot of different topics. Up first is how to connect 
the Galaxy Tab wirelessly to the Internet as well as to other gizmos, such as 
a Bluetooth speaker or printer. There’s a chapter on sharing and exchanging 
files with your computer. Then come the maintenance, customization, and 
troubleshooting chapters.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
Things are wrapped up in this book with the traditional For Dummies Part of 
Tens. Each chapter in this part lists ten items or topics. The chapters include 
tips, tricks, shortcuts, things to remember, and things not to forget, plus a 
smattering of useful apps that no Galaxy Tab should be without.

Part I
The Galaxy in 
Your Hands

I

 credit Moses with being the first person in his­
tory to show mankind how useful tablets can 
be: Portable. Informative. Great for communica­
tions. Valuable to the culture. And despite his 
tablets’ weight, Moses had a good warranty, even 
though he broke them on purpose.
The Galaxy Tab is the latest, best thing when it 
comes to tablets. Unlike the stones upon which 
the Ten Commandments were carved, today’s 
tablets are light-weight and electronic. They’re 
communications devices, dwelling somewhere 
between the land of cell phones and the realm of 
computers. Handy. Portable. Chock-full of good 
information and hours of entertainment. This part 
of the book introduces you to your new tablet 
gizmo.

Welcome to Tablet Land
In This Chapter
▶	Unboxing your Galaxy Tab
▶	Charging the battery
▶	Locating important things
▶	Getting optional accessories
▶	Storing the Tab
I

 thoroughly enjoy getting a new gizmo and opening its box. Expectations 
build. Joy is released. Then frustration descends like a grand piano 
pushed out a third-story window. That’s because any new electronic device, 
especially something as sophisticated as the Galaxy Tab, requires a bit of 
hand-holding. There’s a lot of ground to cover, but it all starts with 
opening the box and with reading this gentle introduction to 
the Samsung Galaxy Tab.
Set Up Your Galaxy Tab
Odds are good that the folks who sold you the 
Galaxy Tab have already done some preconfigura­
tion. In the United States, the Tab is available pri­
marily from cellular phone providers, and getting 
digital cellular service is a usual part of purchasing 
the Tab.
If you have a cellular (non–Wi-Fi) Tab, it’s most likely 
been unboxed and completely manhandled by the Phone 
Store people — maybe even in front of your own eyes! That’s 
a necessary step for a 4G Tab, and even though it might have 
broken your heart (as it did mine), you need that initial setup done before 
you can unbox and set up the Galaxy Tab for yourself.

10
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
	
✓	If you ordered your Galaxy Tab online, the setup may have been done 
before the Tab shipped. If not, see Chapter 2.
	
✓	The initial setup identifies the Tab with the cellular network, giving it a 
network ID and associating the ID with your cellular bill.
	
✓	The Wi-Fi Tab doesn’t require setup with a cellular provider, but it does 
require a Wi-Fi signal to use many features. See Chapter 17 for informa­
tion on configuring your Tab for use with a Wi-Fi network.
	
✓	Additional software setup is required for the Tab, primarily to link 
it with your Gmail and other Google accounts on the Internet. See 
Chapter 2 for the details.
Opening the box
The Galaxy Tab fits snugly inside its box. You’ll find it lying right on top. 
Remove the device by locating and lifting a cardboard tab at the side of 
the box.
After liberating your Galaxy Tab, remove the plastic sheet that’s clinging to 
the device’s front and back. Toss that sheet out, unless you’re enrolled in 
a college art class, in which case you can turn in the sheet for credit as an 
interpretive sculpture project.
In the box’s bottom compartment, you may find
	
✓	A USB cable: You can use it to connect the Tab to a computer or a wall 
charger.
	
✓	A wall charger: It comes in two pieces. The larger piece has the USB 
connector, and the smaller piece is customized for your locality’s wall 
sockets.
	
✓	Earbud-style earphones: The Wi-Fi Tab comes with a set of earphones 
for listening to the Tab’s music and other media in the privacy of your 
own head.
	
✓	Pamphlets with warnings and warranty information: You also receive 
the brief Master Your Device booklet, which you’re free to ignore 
because, honestly, this book puts that thing to shame.
	
✓	A Gift Certificate for the Media Hub: If you’re lucky, you might find a 
$25 gift certificate for the Samsung Media Hub app. Do not throw it away! 
See Chapter 15.
	
✓	The 4G SIM card holder: For the cellular Tab, you’ll need a 4G SIM card. 
The Phone Store people may have tossed its credit card-sized holder 
into the box as well. You can throw it out.
	
✓	Jimmy Hoffa: The former labor leader disappeared in 1975, and no one 
has ever been able to find him. Just in case, look in the bottom of the 
Galaxy Tab’s box to see whether Hoffa’s body is there. You never know.

11
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Tablet Land
Go ahead and free the USB cable and power charger from their clear plas­
tic cocoons. Assemble the power charger’s two pieces, which fit so snugly 
together that you’ll probably never be able to pry them apart.
	
Keep the box for as long as you own your Galaxy Tab. If you ever need to 
return the thing or ship it somewhere, the original box is the ideal container. 
You can shove the pamphlets and papers back into the box as well.
Charging the battery
The first thing that I recommend you do with your Galaxy Tab is give it a full 
charge. Obey these steps:
	
1.	Assemble the wall adapter that came with the Tab.
	
2.	Attach the USB cable to the Galaxy Tab.
	
	 The side of the cable end that’s labeled Samsung faces you as you’re 
looking at the front of the Tab.
	
3.	Attach the other end of the USB cable to the wall adapter.
	
4.	Plug the wall adapter into the wall.
Upon success, you may see a large Battery icon appear on the Galaxy Tab 
touchscreen. The icon gives you an idea of the current battery-power level 
and lets you know that the Galaxy Tab is functioning properly, though you 
shouldn’t be alarmed if the Battery icon fails to appear.
	
✓	Your Galaxy Tab most likely came partially charged from the factory, 
though I still recommend giving it an initial charge just in case, as well as 
to familiarize yourself with the process.
	
✓	The USB cable is used for charging the Galaxy Tab and for connecting it 
to a computer to share information or exchange files or use the Galaxy 
Tab as a computer modem. (You find out about this tethering process in 
Chapter 17.)
	
✓	You can also charge the Tab by connecting it to a computer’s USB port. 
As long as the computer is on, the Tab charges.
	
✓	The battery charges more efficiently if you plug it into a wall rather than 
charge it from a computer’s USB port.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab does not feature a removable battery.
Know Your Way around the Galaxy
“Second star to the right and straight on till morning” may get Peter Pan to 
Neverland, but for navigating your way around the Galaxy Tab, you need 
more-specific directions.

Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
Finding things on the Tab

Tab hardware features. Follow along on your own Tab as you find key fea­
tures, described in this section.

Figure 1-1: Things on the Galaxy Tab.
	
Dock/USB power connector: The key to discovering things on your Tab is to 
first find the Power/USB jack, as shown in Figure 1-1. It’s a thin slot located on 
the long side of the Tab, a side I call the bottom. Because the Tab has no but­
tons or other easily identifiable marks on its front, locating the Power/USB 
jack first helps you orient the Tab as well as locate other goodies, which are 
illustrated in the figure. The slot is also where the Tab connects to the dock, 
if you have one. See the later section, “Getting optional accessories.”
Touchscreen display: The biggest part of the Tab is its touchscreen display, 
which occupies almost all the territory on the front of the device. The touch­
screen display is a see-touch thing: You look at it and also touch it with your 
fingers to control the Tab.

 Chapter 1: Welcome to Tablet Land
Front camera: The Galaxy Tab’s front-facing camera is centered above the 
touchscreen. The camera is used for taking self-portraits as well as for video 
conferencing.
Light sensor: Though it’s difficult to see, just to the left of the front camera 
is a teensy light sensor. It’s used to help adjust the brightness level of the 
touchscreen.
Around the Galaxy Tab, you find a variety of buttons, holes, connectors, and 
other doodads, all carefully explained here:
Headphone jack: Atop the Tab case, you see a hole where you can connect 
standard headphones.
SIM card cover: This spot is used to access the cellular Tab’s SIM card, 
which is inserted into a slot beneath the cover.
Speaker(s): Stereo speakers are located on the left and right sides of the Tab. 
(Feel free to remove the plastic sticker beneath the right speaker if you find 
one there.)
Microphone: A tiny hole on the bottom of the Tab (see Figure 1-1) is where 
you find the device’s microphone.
Volume Up/Volume Down: The Tab’s volume control is located on the right 
side of the cellular unit, just below the Power Lock button. On the Wi-Fi 
Tab, the volume control is on top of the unit, as illustrated in Figure 1-1. 
The button toward the top of the unit is Volume Up, and the other button is 
Volume Down.
	
	 Power Lock: The Power Lock button is labeled with the universal power icon, 
shown in the margin. Press this button to turn on the Tab, to lock it (put it to 
sleep), to wake it up, and to turn it off. Directions for performing these activi­
ties are found in Chapter 2.
Figure 1-2 illustrates the back of the Galaxy Tab. It’s mostly boring except for 
the device’s main camera, illustrated in the figure. In fact, the entire Tab is 
physically boring front and back; all the real goodies are found on its edges.

14
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
The back of the Galaxy Tab can be black or white, which is a choice you 
make when you buy the device. There is no internal difference between the 
black or white Tab.
	
✓	The Power Lock and Volume buttons are in different locations for the 
cellular and Wi-Fi Tab models.
	
✓	You’ll rarely, if ever, access the SIM card.
	
✓	SIM stands for Subscriber Identity Module. The SIM card is used by your 
cellular provider to identify your Tab and keep track of the amount of 
data you access. Yep, that’s so you can be billed properly. The SIM also 
gives your cellular Tab a phone number, though that number is merely 
an account and not something you can dial into or send a text message.
	
✓	Be careful not to confuse the SIM card with the removable storage media 
(MicroSD card) used on other tablets and cell phones; they’re not the 
same thing. The Galaxy Tab doesn’t use a removable media card.
	
✓	Don’t stick anything into the microphone hole. The only things you need 
to stick into the Tab are the USB cable (or the connector on the dock) or 
headphones.
Getting optional accessories
You can buy an assortment of handy Galaxy Tab accessories, and I’m sure 
that the pleasant people at the Phone Store showed you the variety when you 
bought your Tab. Here are just a few of the items that are available or that 
you can consider getting in order to complete your Tab experience:
Earphones: You can use any standard cell phone or portable media player 
earphones with the cellular Galaxy Tab. Simply plug the earphones into the 
headphone jack at the top of the Tab, and you’re ready to go.
Cases: Various cases and case-stands are available for the Galaxy Tab. Some 
are mere enclosures, like a portfolio. Other cases can also be used as stands 
to prop up the Tab for easy viewing.
Keyboards: Several different types of keyboards are available for the Galaxy 
Tab, from the case-keyboard to keyboard docking stands or standard 
Bluetooth keyboards. They can both prop up the Tab for easy viewing as well 
as allow for faster typing than can be done on a touchscreen.
Multimedia Dock: The dock is merely a stand you can use to prop up the Tab for 
easy viewing. It has a speaker jack you can use to connect external speakers.
Galaxy Tab USB Adapter: This USB adapter isn’t the same thing as the USB 
cable that came with your Tab. It’s a dongle that plugs into the Tab’s Power/
USB jack that allows the Tab to host a USB device, such as a keyboard, 
mouse, modem, or external storage device (hard drive or optical drive).

15
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Tablet Land
HDMI adapter: The adapter plugs into the Power/USB jack. Into the adapter, 
you can plug an HDMI cable (which is extra) so that you can view the Tab’s 
output on an HDMI-compatible monitor or television.
Screen protectors: These plastic, clingy things are affixed to the front of the 
Tab, right over the touchscreen. They help protect the touchscreen glass 
from finger smudges and sneeze globs while still allowing you to use the 
touchscreen.
Vehicle charger: You can charge the Galaxy Tab in your car when you buy 
the vehicle charger. This adapter plugs into your car’s 12-volt power supply, 
in the receptacle once known as a cigarette lighter. The vehicle charger is a 
must-have if you plan to use the Galaxy Tab navigation features in your auto 
or you need a charge on the road.
Additional accessories may be available. Check the location where your 
Galaxy Tab was sold to inquire about new items.
	
✓	None of this extra stuff is essential to using the Tab.
	
✓	If the earphones feature a microphone, you can use it for dictation and 
audio recording on the Tab.
	
✓	If the earphones feature a button, you can use the button to pause and 
play music. Press the button once to pause and again to play.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab doesn’t recognize more than one earphone button. For 
example, if you use earphones that feature a Volume or Mute button, 
pressing the extra button does nothing on the Tab.
	
✓	The set of screen protectors I purchased also came with a microfiber 
cloth to help clean the Tab’s screen, plus a special cleaning-solution 
wipe. See Chapter 21 for more information about cleaning the Galaxy 
Tab screen.
	
✓	See Chapter 17 for more information on pairing your Galaxy Tab with 
Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth keyboard.
Where to Keep Your Tab
Like your car keys, glasses, wallet, and light saber, you’ll want to keep your 
Galaxy Tab in a place where it’s safe, easy to find, and always handy whether 
you’re at home, at work, on the road, or in a galaxy far, far away.
Making a home for the Tab
I recommend keeping the Galaxy Tab in the same spot when you’re done 
using it. My first suggestion is to make a spot next to your computer. Keep 
the charging cord handy or just plug the cord into the computer’s USB port 

16
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
so that you can synchronize information with your computer regularly and 
keep the Tab charged.
If you have a docking stand, plug your Tab into it when you’re not toting it 
about.
Above all, avoid keeping the Tab in a place where someone might sit on it, 
step on it, or damage it. For example, don’t leave the Tab under a stack of 
newspapers on a table or counter, where it might get accidentally tossed out 
or put in the recycle bin.
	
As long as you remember to return the Tab to the same spot when you’re 
done with it, you’ll always know where it is.
Taking the Galaxy Tab with you
If you’re like me, you probably carry the Galaxy Tab with you around the 
house, around the office, at the airport, in the air, or while you’re in the car. 
I hope you’re not using the Tab while you’re driving! Regardless, have a por­
table place to store your Tab while you’re on the road.
The ideal storage spot for the Tab is a specially designed Galaxy Tab carry­
ing case or pouch, such as the type of pouches mama kangaroos have, but 
without the expense of owning a zoo. A case keeps the Tab from being dinged, 
scratched, or even unexpectedly turned on while it’s in your backpack, purse, 
carry-on luggage, or wherever you put the Tab when you aren’t using it.
Also see Chapter 19 for information on using the Galaxy Tab on the road.

I

remember reading my very first computer book, back during the steam-
powered “microcomputer” era. The book had very clever and humorous 
directions for turning on the computer. When it came time to turn off the 
system, however, there was nothing. No information was written 
on the proper method for shutting down the computer. No 
details. No humor. Apparently you just turned off the beas­
tie, either by thunking the big red switch or yanking the 
plug from the wall socket.
Things are better today, not only with technology 
but for technology books as well. This chapter not 
only shows you how to turn on the Galaxy Tab, 
but it also offers directions on putting the thing to 
sleep and turning it off. As a bonus, there’s some 
setup information tossed in as well. And, no, I didn’t 
forget the humor.
Hello, Tab
In all the effort made by engineers and wizards to make technology 
easier, one area where they fail is in the basic way you turn on a gizmo. Take 
the Galaxy Tab: You have two different ways to turn it on, plus special bonus 
goodies happen the first time you turn on the Tab. This section discusses the 
details.

18
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
	
✓	Initial setup of the Galaxy Tab works best when you already have a 
Google, or Gmail, account on the Internet. If you lack a Google account, 
see the section “Setting up a Google account,” later in this chapter, for 
details.
	
✓	Setup works differently depending on whether you have a cellular Tab 
or Wi-Fi only. When you have a Wi-Fi–only Tab, the cellular network acti­
vation stage is skipped during setup.
	
✓	See Chapter 17 for information on connecting your Galaxy Tab to a Wi-Fi 
network.
	
✓	The Tab doesn’t start unless the battery is charged. See Chapter 1.
Turning on your Galaxy Tab (for the first time)
The very, very first time your Galaxy Tab was turned on was most likely at 
the Phone Store or at a factory if you ordered your Tab online. That process 
involved hooking up the Tab to the Phone Company’s digital network, but 
that was the extent of the operation.
If the Phone Company hasn’t configured your Tab, you have to do it. See the 
next section, “Activate your Galaxy Tab.” Otherwise, skip ahead to the sec­
tion “Your Google account.”
Activate your Galaxy Tab
Follow these steps to turn on your Galaxy Tab for the first time and activate 
your cellular service:
	
1.	Press the Power Lock button.
	
	 You may have to press it longer than you think; when you see the text 
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 appear on the screen, the Tab has started.
	
2.	Unlock the Tab by dragging the Unlock button out toward the unlock­
ing ring, as shown in Figure 2-1.
	
	 To drag the button, touch it with your finger. Keep your finger on the 
touchscreen and drag your finger in any direction. The unlocking ring 
doesn’t appear until you move the Unlock button.
	
	 Because you’re starting the Tab for the first time, you see the initial 
screen for the setup program. The first thing to do is to tell the Tab 
which language to use.
	
3.	Choose English.
	
	 Yes, if you’re reading this in English, you choose English as the language 
for your Tab. Если ты говоришь русский, выбрать Русский язык.

Your Google account
After your Galaxy Tab has been activated, the next step in configuring it is to 
synchronize the device with your Google account. Obey:
	
1.	Start the Galaxy Tab, if you haven’t already.
	
	 Press the Power Lock button until you see the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 
text on the screen.
	
2.	If necessary, unlock the screen as described in the preceding section.
	
3.	Choose your language and touch the Start button.
	
4.	Ensure that there is a green check mark by the items listed on the Use 
Google’s Location Service screen.
	
	 The two items help the Tab find itself on the Planet Earth. If the items 
aren’t selected, touch the little square next to each item to place a green 
check mark there.
	
5.	Touch the Next button.
	
6.	If prompted, enter the date and time.
	
	 Wi-Fi tabs that aren’t currently connected to a network need to have 
their time updated.

	 It’s time to set up your Google account.
	
8.	Touch the Email text box and type your Google account name.
	
	 Because you read the Tip icon at the start of this section, you’ve already 
set up and configured a Google account. Use the onscreen keyboard to 
type your Google account’s e-mail address into the Email text box.
	
	 See Chapter 4 for more information about typing text on your Galaxy 
Tab.
	
9.	Touch the Password field and type your Google account password.
	
10.	Touch the Sign In button.
	
11.	Ensure that there are two green check marks for the items on the 
Backup and Restore screen.
	
	 With both check marks in place, the information on your Tab is synchro­
nized with existing information in your Google account on the Internet. 
It’s a good thing.
	
12.	Touch the Done button.

 Chapter 2: Galaxy Tab On and Off
The good news is that you’re done. The better news is that you need to com­
plete this setup only once on your Galaxy Tab. From this point on, starting 
the Tab works as described in the next few sections.
	
✓	The information synchronized on the Galaxy Tab includes the following 
items from your Google account on the Internet: the contact list, Gmail 
messages, calendar appointments, and other “Googly” information.
	
✓	One of the first things you may notice to be synchronized between your 
Tab and Google is your Gmail inbox. See Chapter 6 for more information 
on Gmail.
	
✓	See the later sidebar “Who is this Android person?” for more informa­
tion about the Android operating system.
Turning on your Galaxy Tab
To turn on your Galaxy Tab, press and hold the Power Lock button. After a 
few seconds, you see the word Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and then some hyp­
notic animation. The Tab is starting.
Eventually, you see the main unlock screen, shown earlier, in Figure 2-1. Use 
your finger to slide the Unlock button outside the unlocking ring, as indicated 
in the figure. After your Galaxy Tab is unlocked, you can start using it — and, 
unlike the first time you turned the thing on, you aren’t prompted to com­
plete the setup routine. (well, unless you skipped setup the first time).
	
✓	Refer to Figure 1-1, in Chapter 1, for the specific location of the Power 
Lock button.
	
✓	You probably won’t turn on your Galaxy Tab much in the future. Mostly, 
you’ll wake the gizmo from an electronic snooze. See the later section, 
“Waking up the Tab.”
Working the various lock screens
The unlock screen you see when you turn on (or wake up) the Tab isn’t a 
tough lock to pick. In fact, it’s known as the Not Secured option in the Set 
Lock Screen window. If you’ve added more security, you might see any one of 
three different lock screens.
The pattern lock, shown in Figure 2-2, requires that you trace your finger 
along a pattern that includes as many as nine dots on the screen. After you 
match the pattern, the Tab is unlocked, and you can start using it.

Whether or not you see these various lock screens depends on how you’ve 
configured the Galaxy Tab’s security. Specific directions for setting the locks, 
or for removing them and returning to the standard screen lock, are found in 
Chapter 20.
	
✓	The pattern lock can start at any dot, not necessarily the upper-left dot, 
as shown earlier in Figure 2-2.
	
✓	The password lock must contain at least one letter and number, though 
it can also include a smattering of symbols and other characters.
	
✓	For additional information on working the onscreen keyboard, see 
Chapter 4.
Waking up the Tab
You’ll probably leave your Galaxy Tab on all the time. It was designed that 
way. The battery lasts quite a while, so when the Tab is bored or when you’ve 
ignored it for a while, it falls asleep. Well, it’s technically named Sleep mode, a 
special low-power, energy-saving state where the Tab’s screen goes blank.

24
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
When the Galaxy Tab is sleeping, you wake it up by pressing the Power Lock 
button. Unlike turning on the Tab, a quick press of the Power Lock button is 
all that’s needed.
After waking the Tab, you see the unlock screen, shown in Figure 2-1. Or, if 
you’ve configured the Tab for more security, you see one of the unlocking 
screens shown in Figures 2-2 through 2-4. Simply unlock the screen, and you 
can start using the Tab.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab continues to run while it’s sleeping. Mail is received, as 
are text messages. The Tab also continues to play music while it’s sleep­
ing, and the display is off.
	
✓	Touching the touchscreen when it’s off doesn’t wake up the Tab.
	
✓	Loud noises don’t wake up the Tab.
	
✓	The Tab doesn’t snore while it’s sleeping.
	
✓	See the section “Putting the Tab to sleep,” later in this chapter, for infor­
mation on manually snoozing the Galaxy Tab.
Who is this Android person?
Just like your computer, your Galaxy Tab has 
an operating system. It’s the main program in 
charge of all the software (other programs) 
inside your Tab. Unlike on your computer, 
however, Android is a mobile device operat­
ing system, designed primarily for use in cell 
phones but also in the Galaxy Tab. (For that 
reason, you often see the Tab referred to as a 
phone in various apps.)
You find the Android operating system used on 
many of today’s most popular smart phones, 
including the Droid 3, HTC Thunderbolt, and 
other phones I can’t think of right now. By using 
Android, the Tab has access to all the Android 
software — the apps or programs — available 
to Android phones and other mobile devices. 
You can read how to add those apps to your 
Tab in Chapter 16.
Android is based on the Linux operating system, 
which is also a computer operating system, 
though it’s much more stable and bug-free than 
Windows, so it’s not as popular. Google owns, 
maintains, and develops Android, which is why 
your online Google information is synced with 
the Galaxy Tab.
The Android mascot, shown here, often appears 
on Android apps or hardware. He has no official 
name, though most folks call him Andy.

 Chapter 2: Galaxy Tab On and Off
Account Creation and Configuration
After you’ve done the initial configuration as described earlier in this chap­
ter, there’s nothing else you need to do to set up the Galaxy Tab. If you’ve 
skipped that step or you need to create a Google account, follow the direc­
tions in this section to complete the setup process.
Setting up a Google account
	
To get the most from your Galaxy Tab, you must have a Google account. If 
you don’t already have one, drop everything (but not this book) and follow 
these steps to obtain one:
	
1.	Open your computer’s web browser program.
	
	 Yes, it works best if you use your computer, not the Tab, to complete 
these steps.
	
2.	Visit the main Google page at www.google.com.
	
	 Type www.google.com into the web browser’s address bar.
	
3.	Click the Sign In link.
	
	 Another page opens, and on it you can log in to your Google account, 
but you don’t have a Google account, so:
	
4.	Click the link to create a new account.
	
	 The link is typically found beneath the text boxes where you would log 
in to your Google account. As I write this chapter, the link is titled Sign 
Up for a New Google Account.
	
5.	Continue heeding the directions until you’ve created your own Google 
account.
Eventually, your account is set up and configured.
To try things out, log off from Google and then log back in. That way, you ensure 
that you’ve done everything properly — and remembered your password. (Your 
web browser may even prompt you to let it remember the password for you.)
I also recommend creating a bookmark for your account’s Google page: The 
Ctrl+D or Ô+D keyboard shortcut is used to create a bookmark in just about 
any web browser.
Continue reading in the next section for information on synchronizing your 
new Google account with the Galaxy Tab.

Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
Attaching your Google account to the Galaxy Tab
Don’t fret if you’ve failed to obey the prompts and neglected to sign in to 
your Google account when first configuring the Galaxy Tab. You can rerun 
the configuration setup at any time. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Turn on or wake up the Galaxy Tab if it’s not already on and eagerly 
awaiting your next move.
	
2.	Unlock the Tab if necessary.
	
	 You can find directions earlier in this chapter, in the section “Working 
the various lock screens.”
	
	
3.	Touch the Apps Menu button.
	
	 The Apps Menu button is located in the upper-right corner of the Home 
screen. Its icon is shown in the margin.
	
4.	Choose the Settings icon.
	
	 The Settings screen appears, which contains commands for configuring 
and setting options for the Galaxy Tab.
	
5.	Choose Accounts & Sync.
	
6.	Touch the Add Account button in the upper-right part of the screen.
	
7.	Choose Google Accounts.
	
	 At this point, you’re signing into your Google account on the Galaxy Tab. 
Refer to the earlier section, “Your Google account,” and start reading at 
Step 7.
Your goal is to synchronize your Google account information on the Internet 
with the information on your Galaxy Tab.
Adding your personal e-mail account to the Tab, as well as other free online 
e-mail accounts, is covered in Chapter 6. Refer to Chapter 8 for information 
on adding social networking accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter.
Goodbye, Tab
I know of three ways to say goodbye to your Galaxy Tab, and only one of 
them involves training an elephant. The other two methods are documented 
in this section.

 Chapter 2: Galaxy Tab On and Off
Putting the Tab to sleep
To sleep the Tab, simply press its Power Lock button. The display goes dark; 
the Tab is asleep.
	
✓	In Sleep mode, the Galaxy Tab still works, still receives e-mail, and can 
still play music. But it’s not using as much power as it would with the 
display on.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab will probably spend most of its time in Snooze mode.
	
✓	Snoozing doesn’t turn off the Tab.
	
✓	Any timers or alarms you set still activate when the Tab is in Sleep 
mode. See Chapter 15 for information on setting timers and alarms.
	
✓	To wake up the Tab, press and release the Power Lock button. See the 
section “Waking up the Tab,” earlier in this chapter.
Controlling the sleep timeout
You can manually snooze the Galaxy Tab at any time by pressing the Power 
Lock button. In fact, some documentation calls it the Power Lock button 
because snoozing the Tab is the same as locking it. When you don’t manually 
snooze the tab, it automatically goes into Sleep mode after a given period of 
inactivity, just like Uncle Tony does during family gatherings.
You have control over the snooze timeout value, which can be set anywhere 
from 15 seconds to 1 hour. Obey these steps:
	
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose Screen.
	
4.	Choose Timeout.
	
5.	Choose a timeout value from the list.
	
	 I prefer 1 minute, which is also the standard value.
	
	
6.	Touch the Home icon button to return to the Home screen.
The sleep timer begins after a period of inactivity; when you don’t touch the 
screen or tap an icon button, the timer starts ticking. About 5 seconds before 
the timeout value you set (refer to Step 5), the touchscreen dims. Then it 
turns off, and the Tab goes to sleep. If you touch the screen before then, the 
timer is reset.

28
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
Turning off the Galaxy Tab
To turn off the Tab, heed these steps:
	
1.	Press and hold the Power Lock button.
	
	 You see the Tablet Options menu, shown in Figure 2-5. (The Wi-Fi Tab’s 
Tablet Options menu lacks a Restart command.)
Figure 2-5: The Tablet Options menu.
	
	
	 If you chicken out and don’t want to turn off the Tab, touch the Back 
icon button to dismiss the Tablet Options menu.
	
2.	Touch the Power Off item.
	
3.	Touch OK.
	
	 The Galaxy Tab turns itself off.
The Tab doesn’t run when it’s off, so it doesn’t remind you of appointments, 
collect e-mail, or let you hear any alarms you’ve set. The Tab also isn’t angry 
with you for turning it off, though you may sense some resentment when you 
turn it on again.
Be sure to keep the Tab in a safe place while it’s turned off. See the section 
on where to keep your tab in Chapter 1.

I

’m not certain, but I think the Galaxy Tab is more powerful than 
all the computers in the bat cave from the 1960s TV show, 
Batman. Those computers were impressive: They had lots 
of buttons and flashing lights. In today’s high-tech world, 
however, sophisticated devices don’t have a lot of 
buttons and flashing lights. In fact, the more sophisti­
cated the device, such as your Galaxy Tab, the fewer 
the buttons and lights.
To accommodate for the lack of buttons, the 
Galaxy Tab features a touchscreen. You use the 
touchscreen to control the Tab, which is probably 
a new experience for you. To get you up to speed, 
and to get Batman up to speed should he be reading 
this book, I present this chapter on understanding the 
Galaxy Tab’s touchscreen interface.

30
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
Basic Operations
It’s not a computer. It’s not a phone. The Galaxy Tab is truly something dif­
ferent, probably unlike anything you’ve ever used. To control this unique 
gizmo, you have to familiarize yourself with some basic tablet operations, as 
covered in this section.
Touching the touchscreen
Bereft of buttons and knobs, the way you control the Galaxy Tab is for the 
most part by manipulating things on the touchscreen with one or two fingers. 
It doesn’t matter which fingers you use, and feel free to experiment with 
other body parts as well, though I find fingers to be handy.
You have specific ways to touch the touchscreen, and those specific ways 
have names. Here’s the list:
Touch: The simplest way to manipulate the touchscreen is to touch it. You 
touch an object, an icon, a control, a menu item, a doodad, and so on. The 
touch operation is similar to a mouse click on a computer. It may also be 
referred to as a tap or press.
Double-tap: Touch the screen twice in the same location. Double-tapping can 
be used to zoom in on an image or a map, but it can also zoom out. Because 
of the double-tap’s dual nature, I recommend using the pinch or spread oper­
ation instead when you want to zoom.
Long-press: A long-press occurs when you touch part of the screen and keep 
your finger down. Depending on what you’re doing, a pop-up menu may 
appear, or the item you’re long-pressing may get “picked up” so that you can 
move it around after a long-press. Long-press might also be referred to as 
touch and hold in some documentation.
Swipe: To swipe, you touch your finger on one spot and then drag it to 
another spot. Swipes can go up, down, left, or right, which moves the touch­
screen content in the direction you swipe your finger. A swipe can be fast or 
slow. It’s also called a flick or slide.
Pinch: A pinch involves two fingers, which start out separated and then are 
brought together. The effect is used to zoom out, to reduce the size of an 
image or see more of a map.
Spread: The opposite of pinch is spread. You start out with your fingers 
together and then spread them. The spread is used to zoom in, to enlarge an 
image or see more detail on a map.

31
 Chapter 3: Find Your Way around the Galaxy
Rotate: A few apps let you rotate an image on the screen by touching with 
two fingers and twisting them around a center point. Think of turning a com­
bination lock on a safe, and you get the rotate operation.
	
You can’t manipulate the touchscreen while wearing gloves unless they’re 
gloves specially designed for using electronic touchscreens, such as the 
gloves that Batman wears.
Changing the orientation
The Galaxy Tab features a gizmo called an accelerometer. It determines in 
which direction the Tab is pointed or whether you’ve reoriented the device 
from an upright to a horizontal position, or even upside down. That way, the 
information on the Tab always appears upright, no matter how you hold it.
To demonstrate how the Galaxy Tab orients itself, rotate the Tab to the left 
or right. The Tab can be used in either vertical or horizontal orientations. 
Most apps change their orientation to match however you’ve turned the Tab, 
such as the Home screen shown in Figure 3-1.
Vertical orientation
Horizontal orientation
Figure 3-1: Galaxy Tab orientation.

32
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
The rotation feature may not work for all apps, especially Android apps 
designed for use on cell phones and not tablets. Some games present them­
selves in one orientation only.
	
✓	You can lock the orientation if the rotating screen bothers you. See the 
section “Making Quick Settings,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	This book shows the Home screen, as well as most other apps, in a hori­
zontal orientation. See the later section, “Behold the Home Screen,” for 
more information on the Home screen.
	
	
✓	A great application for demonstrating the Galaxy Tab accelerometer is 
the game Labyrinth. It can be purchased at the Android Market, or the 
free version, Labyrinth Lite, can be downloaded. See Chapter 16 for more 
information about the Android Market.
Controlling the volume
There are times when the sound level is too loud. There are times when it’s 
too soft. And, there are those rare times when it’s just right. Finding that just-
right level is the job of the volume control buttons that cling to the left side 
of the Galaxy Tab.
Pressing the top part of the Volume button makes the volume louder; press­
ing the bottom part makes the volume softer. As you press the button, a 
graphic appears on the touchscreen to illustrate the relative volume level, as 
shown in Figure 3-2.

 Chapter 3: Find Your Way around the Galaxy
Touch the Settings button, shown in Figure 3-2, to see more detailed volume 
controls. You can individually set the volume for media, alerts, and alarms, 
as shown in the expanded onscreen volume control: Drag the green dot left 
or right to set the volume.
	
✓	When the volume is set all the way down, the Tab is silenced.
	
✓	Silencing the Tab by sliding down the volume level places it into 
Vibration mode.
	
✓	The Volume button works even when the Tab is snoozing (in Sleep mode 
or when the touchscreen display is off). That means you don’t need to 
wake the Tab if you’re playing music and need to adjust the volume.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 20 for information on placing the Tab into Vibration 
mode.
Behold the Home Screen
The main base from which you begin exploration of the Galaxy Tab is the 
Home screen. It’s the first thing you see after unlocking the Tab, and the 
place you go to whenever you quit an application.
Touring the Home screen
The main Home screen for the Galaxy Tab is illustrated in Figure 3-3.
There are several fun and interesting things to notice on the Home screen:
Home screen buttons: Special symbols are found on three corners of the 
Home screen, as well as in quite a few apps. The symbols identify buttons 
you touch to activate common Galaxy Tab features. 
Notification icons: These icons come and go, depending on what happens in 
your digital life. For example, new icons appear whenever you receive a new 
e-mail message or have a pending appointment. The section “Reviewing noti­
fications,” later in this chapter, describes how to deal with notifications.
Status icons: These icons represent the Tab’s current condition, such as the 
type of network it’s connected to, signal strength, and battery status, as well 
as whether the Tab is connected to a Wi-Fi network or using Bluetooth, for 
example.
App icons: The meat of the meal on the Home screen plate is where the action 
takes place: app (application) icons. Touching an icon runs its program.

Widgets: A widget is a teensy program that can display information, let you 
control the Tab, access features, or do something purely amusing. You can 
read more about widgets in Chapter 20.
Ensure that you recognize the names of the various parts of the Home 
screen, because the terms are used throughout this book and in whatever 
other scant Galaxy Tab documentation exists. Directions for using the Home 
screen gizmos are found throughout this chapter.
	
✓	The Home screen is entirely customizable. You can add and remove icons 
from the Home screen, add widgets and shortcuts, and even change wall­
paper (background) images. See Chapter 20 for more information.
	
✓	When you rotate the Galaxy Tab, the Home screen changes its orienta­
tion to match. (Refer to Figure 3-1.) The horizontal Home screen features 
all the same gizmos as the vertical Home screen, but because of the 
narrow width, many of the items shuffle around.

35
 Chapter 3: Find Your Way around the Galaxy
	
✓	Touching a part of the Home screen that doesn’t feature an icon or a 
control does nothing. That is, unless you’re using the live wallpaper 
feature. In that case, touching the screen changes the wallpaper in some 
way, depending on the wallpaper that’s selected. You can read more 
about live wallpaper in Chapter 20.
Accessing multiple Home screens
The Home screen is more than what you see. It’s actually an entire street of 
Home screens, with only one Home screen panel displayed at a time.
To switch from one panel to another, swipe the Home screen left or right. 
There are two panels to the left of the main Home screen panel, and two 
panels to the right.
	
	 When you touch the Home icon button, you’re returned to the last Home 
screen panel you viewed. To return to the main, center Home screen panel, 
touch the Home icon button a second time.
Using the icon buttons
Festooning the Galaxy Tab Home screen are various symbols or icons. Those 
icons identify buttons you can touch. The icon buttons are used to control the 
Tab, seeing how the device lacks the necessary physical buttons. Table 3-1 
lists the most common icon buttons.

the magnifying glass is referenced, as shown in Table 3-1.
	
✓	The Add button is also known as the Customize button. Beyond the 
Home screen, you’ll find that button in apps where you can also add or 
customize items.
	
	
✓	The Back icon button changes its appearance when the onscreen key­
board or recent apps list is displayed. It’s still the Back icon button, but 
it changes appearance, as shown in the margin. Touch the button to dis­
miss the item that popped up on the screen.
	
✓	The little triangle in the lower-right corner of the Menu icon button is 
used in many apps to denote a pop-up or shortcut menu attached to 
something on the screen. Touch that triangle to see the shortcut menu.
	
✓	Other common symbols are used on icon buttons in various apps. For 
example, the standard Play/Pause icons are used as well as variations on 
the symbols shown in Tables 3-1 and 3-2.
Home Screen Chores
To become a cat, you must know how to perform several duties: Sleep, eat, 
catch critters, and cause mischief. A cat’s life isn’t difficult, and neither is 
your Galaxy Tab life, as long as you know how to do some basic duties on the 
Home screen. As with the cat, you have only a few duties to know about.
Starting an application
It’s blissfully simple to run an application on the Home screen: Touch its 
icon. The application starts.
	
✓	Not all applications appear on the Home screen, but all of them appear 
when you display the Apps Menu screen. See the section “Visiting the 
Apps Menu,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	When an application closes or you quit the application, you’re returned 
to the Home screen.
	
✓	Application is abbreviated as app.

Accessing a widget
Like application icons, widgets can appear on the Home screen. To use a 
widget, touch it. What happens next, of course, depends on the widget and 
what it does. 
For example, the YouTube widget is preset on the first Home screen panel 
to the left of the main Home screen. You can swipe your finger across that 
widget to peruse videos like you’re flipping the pages in a book; touch a 
video to view it.
Other widgets do interesting things, display useful information, or give you 
access to the Galaxy Tab’s features.
See Chapter 20 for details on working with widgets.
Reviewing notifications
Notifications appear as icons at the bottom right of the Home screen, as illus­
trated earlier, in Figure 3-3. You can check out notifications individually or 
look at the whole swath of them all at once.
To review an individual notification, touch its icon at the bottom right of the 
screen, as illustrated in Figure 3-4. The notification pop-up disappears rather 
quickly, so to act on the notification, you must touch it, as indicated in the 
figure. Or you can dismiss the notification by touching the X (Close) button.

✓	If you don’t deal with the notifications, they can stack up!
	
✓	Notification icons disappear after they’ve been chosen.
	
✓	Dismissing some notifications doesn’t prevent them from appearing 
again in the future. For example, notifications to update your programs 
continue to appear, as do calendar reminders.
	
✓	Some programs, such as Facebook and the various Twitter apps, don’t 
display notifications unless you’re logged in. See Chapter 8.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab plays a sound, or ringtone, when a new notification 
floats in. You can choose which sound plays; see Chapter 20 for more 
information.
	
✓	See Chapter 15 for information on dismissing calendar reminders.
Making Quick Settings
	
	 The Quick Settings are a clutch of popular Tab features, each of which can be 
quickly accessed from the notifications pop-up. To see the Quick Settings, 
pop up the notifications list as described in the preceding section. Then 
touch the Settings icon button, as shown in the margin. The Quick Settings 
are shown in Figure 3-6.
You can use several items in the Quick Settings list to manipulate various 
options on the Galaxy Tab:
Airplane Mode/Flight Mode: Turns off the Tab’s wireless radios that are not 
allowed to be on during an airplane trip. See Chapter 19 for more information 
on using the Galaxy Tab while aloft.
Wi-Fi: Displays the Wireless & Networks, Wi-Fi Settings window. See Chapter 17 
for information on accessing wireless networks.
Auto-Rotate Screen: Enables the Tab’s ability to rotate and reorient the 
touchscreen based on which way you’re holding the Galaxy Tab. See the sec­
tion “Changing the orientation,” earlier in this chapter.
Brightness: Specifies how bright the touchscreen appears. Touch the word 
Auto to enable automatic brightness based on ambient light. Otherwise, drag 
the dot left or right to make the screen brighter or darker, respectively.
Notifications: Turns on or off the notification icon display at the bottom of 
the touchscreen.

Visiting the Apps Menu
The application icons you see on the Home screen don’t represent all the apps 
in your Galaxy Tab. Those icons aren’t even applications themselves; they’re 
shortcuts. To see all applications installed on your Galaxy Tab, you must visit 
the Apps Menu screen. To do so, touch the Apps button on the Home screen.

Reviewing recent apps
	
	 If you’re like me, you probably use the same apps over and over on your 
Galaxy Tab. You can easily access that list of recent apps by touching the 
Recent Apps icon button on the Home screen. When you do, you see a 
pop-up list of apps most recently accessed, similar to the list shown in 
Figure 3-8.

Typing and Text on the Tab
In This Chapter
▶	Using the onscreen keyboard
▶	Typing on the Samsung keypad
▶	Accessing special characters
▶	Editing text
▶	Selecting, cutting, copying, and pasting text
▶	Dictating text with voice input
B

elieve it or not, the interface to the first computers had no monitor. 
Nope, computer scientists and proto-nerds of the 1960s used teletype 
machines. That was if they were lucky; before then punch cards were popu­
lar. But historically speaking, a physical keyboard has always been 
a part of the high tech scene. Until now.
Your Galaxy Tab lacks a real, live keyboard. All it has is 
a touchscreen, though you can use that touchscreen 
for typing. It works because of something called the 
onscreen keyboard. Not only that, but you can use 
your finger to edit and manipulate the text you 
type. Tab typing is a new concept. It can be frus­
trating. It can be strange. It can be understood and 
accepted if you follow my advice in this chapter. 
The Old Hunt-and-Peck
The old mechanical typewriters required a lot of effort 
to press their keys. It was forceful: clackity-clack-clack. 
Electronic typewriters made typing easier. And, of course, the com­
puter is the easiest thing to type on. A tablet? That device takes some getting 
used to because its keys are merely flat rectangles on a touchscreen. If this 
concept doesn’t drive you nuts, typing on a tablet is something you should 
master with relative ease.

46
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
Using the onscreen keyboard
For text communications on the Galaxy Tab, you touch an onscreen key­
board. That keyboard pops up whenever the Tab requires text input or when 
you have an opportunity to type something.
The basic onscreen keyboard is officially known as the Samsung keypad. Its 
layout is shown in Figure 4-1. You’ll be relieved to see that it’s similar to the 
standard computer keyboard, though some of the keys change their function 
depending on what you’re typing.
Delete / Backspace
Symbol keys
Shift
Keyboard settings
E-mail keys
Web keys
Figure 4-1: The Samsung keypad onscreen keyboard.
Figure 4-1 illustrates the onscreen keyboard in Alphabetic mode. You see 
keys from A through Z in lowercase. You also see a Shift key for producing 
capital letters, and a Delete key, which works to backspace and erase.
The Enter key below the Delete key changes its look depending on what 
you’re typing. Five variations are shown in Figure 4-1. Here’s what each one 
does:
Enter/Return: Just like the Enter or Return key on your computer key­
board, this key ends a paragraph of text. It’s used mostly when filling in 
long stretches of text or when multiline input is available.
Go: This action key directs the app to proceed with a search, accept 
input, or perform another action.

47
 Chapter 4: Typing and Text on the Tab
Search: You see the Search key appear when you’re searching for some­
thing on the Tab. Touching the key starts the search.
Next: This key appears when you’re typing information into multiple 
fields. Touching this key switches from one field to the next, such as 
when typing a username and password.
Done: This key appears whenever you’ve finished typing text in the 
final field of a screen that has several fields. Sometimes it dismisses the 
onscreen keyboard, sometimes not.
The large U key at the bottom center of the onscreen keyboard is the Space 
key. Next to it is the Smiley key, which inserts the colon, dash, and right 
parenthesis characters into your text, commonly known as the smiley.
Between the Space and Smiley keys, you’ll occasionally see two sets of three 
additional keys. These sets of keys are used to assist when typing e-mail and 
web page addresses. The .com and www. keys insert all those characters 
with one key press.
The ! and ? keys also change, as shown in Figure 4-1: When typing in some 
situations, the exclamation point changes to an underline, and the question 
mark changes to a hyphen. When does that happen? I don’t know, but watch 
out for it.
Also see the next section for accessing the number-and-symbol keys on the 
onscreen keyboard.
	
✓	If you pine for a real keyboard, one that exists in the fourth dimension, 
you’re not stuck. See the nearby sidebar, “A real keyboard?”
	
	
✓	To dismiss the onscreen keyboard, touch the Back-Hide icon button that 
replaces the standard Back icon button on the touchscreen.
	
✓	To re-summon the keyboard, touch any text field or spot on the screen 
where typing is permitted.
	
✓	Touch the Keyboard Settings (Gear) key to make adjustments to the 
onscreen keyboard.
	
✓	The keyboard reorients itself when you turn the Tab to a vertical posi­
tion, though it’s narrower and it may not be as easy on your fingers for 
typing.
	
✓	Some folks feel that the onscreen keyboard isn’t complete unless there 
is a dictation button. See the section “Activating voice input on the key­
board,” later in this chapter, for the secret instructions.

48
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
Accessing other symbols
You’re not limited to typing only the symbols you see on the alphabetic key­
board, shown in Figure 4-1. The onscreen keyboard has many more symbols 
available, which you can see by touching the 123 key. Touching this key 
gives you access to three additional keyboard layouts, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Touch the 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 key to switch between various symbol key­
boards, as illustrated in Figure 4-2.
To return to the standard “alpha” keyboard (refer to Figure 4-1), touch the 
ABC key.
	
You can access special character keys from the main alphabetic keyboard, 
providing you know a secret: Long-press (touch and hold) a key. When you 
do, you see a pop-up palette of additional characters, similar to the ones 
shown for the A key in Figure 4-3.
Choose a character from the pop-up palette or touch the X button to close 
the pop-up palette.
Not every character has a special pop-up palette.
Typing duties
It’s cinchy to type on the onscreen keyboard: Just press a letter to produce 
the character. It works just like a computer keyboard in that respect. Plus 
the keyboard is large enough in the Tab’s horizontal orientation that you can 
almost touch-type.
A real keyboard?
If typing is your thing and the onscreen key­
board doesn’t do it for you, consider getting the 
Galaxy Tab keyboard dock: This docking stand 
props up the Tab at a good viewing angle but, 
unlike the multimedia dock, features a laptop-
size keyboard.
Another choice for typing in the real world 
is to get a Bluetooth keyboard. I feel it’s a 
better option than the keyboard dock because 
Bluetooth is wireless, which kind of goes well 
with the whole mobile computing paradigm. 
The Galaxy Tab works with any Bluetooth key­
board, and you can read more about Bluetooth 
in Chapter 17.

✓	When you make a mistake, press the Delete key to back up and erase.
	
✓	A blinking cursor on the touchscreen shows where new text appears,

Adding spell check and typing correction
Anyone can type, but it’s the rare individual who can spell. In fact, if it 
weren’t for my word processor’s spell checker (and my adept editor), my 
spelling would be uhtrohshush atrocious. So, with great relief and joy, I pres­
ent to you the method you use to add typing correction to the onscreen key­
board. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Keyboard Settings key to summon the Samsung Keypad 
Settings screen.
	
	 The Keyboard Settings key looks like a gear and is just to the left of the 
Space key. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)
	
2.	Ensure that a check mark appears by the option XT9.
	
	 To place a check mark by that option, touch the gray check mark box.
	
3.	Ensure that a check mark appears by the option Automatic Full Stop.
	
	 Setting this option directs the Galaxy Tab to add a period anytime you 
press the Space key twice.
	
4.	Ensure that a check mark appears by the option Auto-Capitalization.
	
	 When this option is set, the Tab automatically capitalizes any character 
you type after typing a period and a space.
	
	
5.	Touch the Back icon button to return to whatever you were doing 
earlier.
When the XT9 option is on, you see a list of text suggestions appear as you 
use the onscreen keyboard, as shown in Figure 4-4. Choose a word from the 
list by touching it with your finger, or choose the first (fully highlighted) 
word by touching the Space key.
To undo an automatic word selection, press the Delete key on the keyboard.
	
✓	If you find the XT9 setting annoying (and many do), repeat the steps in 
this section to disable it.
	
✓	I have no idea why it’s XT9 and not something easier to remember, like 
Word-Suggestion-o-Rama.
	
✓	Well, actually, XT9 comes from T9, a predictive-text technology designed 
for cell phones. T9 stands for typing text on nine keys, which is what you 
would find on a phone. The XT9 is an extension of that predictive-typing 
technology.

Text Editing
You’ll probably do more text editing on your Galaxy Tab than you realize. 
That includes the basic stuff, such as spiffing up typos and adding a period 
here or there as well as complex editing involving cut, copy, and paste. The 
concepts are the same as you find on a computer, but without a keyboard 
and mouse, the process can be daunting. This section irons out the text-
editing wrinkles.
	
	 A great app on which to test your text-editing skills is the AK Notepad. You 
can find it at the Android Market (see Chapter 16), or scan the QR code in the 
margin for a quick download link.
Moving the cursor
The first part of editing text is to move the cursor to the right spot. The 
cursor is that blinking, vertical line where text appears. On most computing 
devices, you move the cursor by using a pointing device. The Galaxy Tab has 
no pointing device, but you do: your finger.
	
	 To move the cursor, simply touch the spot on the text where you want to 
move the cursor. To help your precision, a cursor tab appears below the text, 
as shown in the margin. You can move that tab with your finger to move the 
cursor around in the text.

52
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
After you move the cursor, you can continue to type, use the Delete key to 
back up and erase, or paste in text copied from elsewhere.
You may see a pop-up by the cursor tab with a Paste command button in 
it. That button is used to paste in text, as described in the later section, 
“Cutting, copying, and pasting.”
Selecting text
Selecting text on the Galaxy Tab works just like selecting text in a word pro­
cessor: You mark the start and end of a block. That chunk of text appears 
highlighted on the screen.
Text-selection starts by long-pressing a chunk of text. Sometimes you have 
to press for a while, but eventually you see the Text Selection toolbar appear 
on the top of the screen. You also see a chunk of text selected, as shown in 
Figure 4-5.
Close the Text Selection toolbar

End block marker
Selected text

Drag the start and end markers around the touchscreen to define the block 
of selected text. Or you can touch the Select All command at the top of the 
screen to mark all the text as a single block. (Refer to Figure 4-5.)
After you select the text, you can delete it by touching the Delete key on the 
keyboard. You can replace the text by typing something new. Or you can cut 
or copy the text. See the section “Cutting, copying, and pasting,” later in this 
chapter.

53
 Chapter 4: Typing and Text on the Tab
To cancel text selection, touch the Done button, or just touch anywhere on 
the touchscreen outside of the selected block.
	
✓	Seeing the onscreen keyboard is a good indication that you can edit and 
select text.
	
✓	Sometimes you may see a pop-up menu when you long-press text. If so, 
choose the Select Text command. You’ll then see the Text Selection tool­
bar and be able to select text on the screen.
Selecting text on a web page
It’s possible to select text from a web page even though the text there isn’t 
“editable” text. Because the text isn’t editable, or even edible, you need to 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Long-press the web page near the text you want to copy.
	
	 The start and end block markers appear, as does the Text Selection toolbar, 
though it doesn’t look exactly like Figure 4-5: In addition to the Copy and 
Select All commands, there are Share, Find, and Web Search commands.
	
2.	Move the cursor tabs to mark the beginning and end of the block.
	
	 If you move the tabs beyond a text region on the page, they disappear 
and are replaced by an area-selection tool, as shown in Figure 4-6. Use 
the four arrows to select a region of text on the web page.
	
3.	Choose Copy from the Text Selection toolbar.
Resize selected text

Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
The text is copied into the Galaxy Tab clipboard. From there, it can be pasted 
into any app that accepts text input. See the next section.
	
✓	You can only copy text from a web page. Obviously, you cannot cut text.
	
✓	Copying text from a web page allows you to paste that text into an e-mail 
message or Facebook status update or into any field where you can 
paste text on the Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	The two other commands on the text-selection pop-up menu are Search 
and Share. Choose Search to look for text within the selected block. 
Choose the Share command to share the block as text or as an image via 
e-mail, instant message, Facebook, or any other sharing app installed on 
your Tab.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on surfing the web with your 
Galaxy Tab.
Cutting, copying, and pasting
Selected text is primed for cutting or copying, which works just like it does 
in your favorite word processor. After you select the text, choose the proper 
command from the Text Selection toolbar: To copy the text, choose the Copy 
command. To cut the text, choose Cut.
Just like on your computer, cut or copied text on the Galaxy Tab is stored in 
a clipboard. To paste any previously cut or copied text, move the cursor to 
the spot where you want the text pasted.
If you’re lucky, you’ll see a Paste command button appear above the blinking 
cursor, as shown in Figure 4-7. Touch that command to paste in the text.
When you can’t seem to summon the Paste 
command button or it vanishes before you can 
touch it, long-press the text again. When the 
Text Selection toolbar appears, touch the Paste 
command.
The Paste command can be anywhere text is 
input on the Tab, such as in an e-mail message, 
a Twitter tweet, or any text field. Then touch the 
Paste icon that appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
	
✓	The Paste command button shows up only 
when there’s text to paste.
	
✓	You can paste text only into locations where text is allowed. Odds are 
good that if you can type, or whenever you see the onscreen keyboard, 
you can paste text.

 Chapter 4: Typing and Text on the Tab
Galaxy Tab Dictation
The Galaxy Tab has the amazing ability to interpret your dictation as text. It 
works almost as well as computer dictation in science fiction movies, though 
I can’t seem to find the command to launch photon torpedoes.
Activating voice input on the keyboard
To use diction instead of typing, you need to activate voice input for the 
Samsung keypad. Obey these steps:
	
1.	Display the onscreen keyboard.
	
	 Touch a text box or somehow get the onscreen keyboard to appear.
	
2.	Touch the Settings button, the one with the Gear icon.
	
3.	Touch the check box by Voice Input to place a green check mark 
there.
	
4.	Touch the Yes button to confirm.
	
	 You can touch the Home icon button to return to the Home screen when 
you’re done.
	
	 A new button now appears on the onscreen keyboard, near the bottom right. 
It’s the Microphone button, as shown in the margin. Touch that button to dic­
tate text instead of typing it.
Using voice input
Talking to your Tab really works, and works quite well, providing that you 
touch the Microphone key on the keyboard and properly dictate your text.
After touching the Microphone key, you see a special window appear on the 
bottom of the screen. When the text Speak Now appears, dictate your text; 
speak directly at the Tab.
As you speak, a Microphone graphic on the screen flashes. The flashing 
doesn’t mean that the Galaxy Tab is embarrassed by what you’re saying. No, 
the flashing merely indicates that the Tab is listening, detecting the volume 
of your voice.
After you stop talking, the Tab digests what you said. You see your voice 
input appear as a wavelike pattern on the screen. Eventually, the text you 
spoke — or a close approximation — appears on the screen. It’s magical and 
sometimes comical.

56
Part I: The Galaxy in Your Hands 
	
✓	The first time you try voice input, you might see a description displayed. 
Touch the OK button to continue.
	
✓	The better your diction, the better your results. Also, it helps to speak 
only a sentence or less.
	
✓	You can edit your voice input just as you edit any text. See the section 
“Text Editing,” earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	Speak the punctuation in your text. For example, you would say, “I’m 
sorry comma and it won’t happen again” to have the Galaxy Tab pro­
duce the text I’m sorry, and it won’t happen again (or similar 
wording).
	
✓	Common punctuation you can dictate includes the comma, period, 
exclamation point, question mark, and colon.
	
✓	Pause your speech before and after speaking punctuation.
	
✓	There is no way presently to capitalize words you dictate.
	
✓	Dictation may not work where no Internet connection exists.
Uttering s**** words
	
The Galaxy Tab features a voice censor. It replaces those naughty words 
you might utter, placing the word’s first letter on the screen, followed by the 
appropriate number of asterisks.
For example, if spatula were a blue word and you uttered spatula when dictat­
ing text, the dictation feature would place s****** on the screen rather than 
the word spatula.
Yeah, I know: silly. Or “s****.”
The Tab knows a lot of blue terms, including the infamous “Seven Words You 
Can Never Say on Television,” but apparently the terms crap and damn are 
fine. Don’t ask me how much time I spent researching this topic.
Searching with your voice
You can say “Here kitty” all you like, but the cat may never come. On the 
Galaxy Tab, however, you can use the Voice Search app to find things with 
your voice and actually meet with some decent results.

57
 Chapter 4: Typing and Text on the Tab
Start the Voice Search app by locating it on the Apps Menu. You can also 
access Voice Search from the Home screen by touching the Microphone icon 
in the upper-left corner.
After starting the app, you see the Voice Search input box. Dictate what you 
want, such as “Restaurants near me.” In a few moments, the Galaxy Tab runs 
the proper app and finds what you’re looking for.
Examples of what you can utter into the Voice Search app include
Find a good Chinese restaurant
Send e-mail to Obama
Set alarm for o’dark thirty
Listen to The Monkees
I admit that this feature is a tad unreliable, especially compared with how 
well the Dictation feature works overall. Still, it’s worth a try if you truly want 
to play Mr. Spock and dictate your commands to a cold, impersonal piece of 
electronics.

The 
Communications 
Tab

S

ome say that technology isolates people, but 
a valid argument can be made that never 
before has everyone been so connected. Sure, we 
may not get together in person, and it’s probably 
been a really long time since you’ve hand-written 
a letter to someone. That is, if you’ve ever written 
anyone a letter. Studies show that most kids 
prefer to text each other than to talk on the 
phone.
Welcome to electronically connected life in the 
21st century. I’m sure that you’ve heard of e-mail. 
You’ve probably also heard of the World Wide 
Web. And that Facebook thing? Well, whether or 
not you know about any of that stuff, it’s all cov­
ered in this part of the book. The topic here is 
communications. It’s something that the Galaxy 
Tab does well.

W

hen I was a kid, I kept a dozen or so phone numbers in my head. That 
was enough to phone someone in a pinch. Beyond that, there was 
the address book or numbers written down on the kitchen cabinet. Today, 
things are different. Not only do people typically have more than one phone 
number, but there are e-mail addresses, websites, and a host of other 
information. Why cram all that stuff inside your head when you 
have something handy like the Galaxy Tab to store it 
for you?
As a communications device, your Galaxy Tab has a 
need to harbor information about all the people you 
know — specifically, those with whom you want to 
communicate electronically. From sending e-mail 
to social networking, you want to have access to 
your list of friends, pals, and cohorts. This chapter 
explains how do that on your Galaxy Tab.
Meet the Contacts App
You may already have some friends in your Galaxy Tab. 
That’s because your Google account was synchronized with the 
Tab when you first set things up. Because all your Gmail and other types 
of contacts on the Internet were duplicated on the Tab, you already have a 

62
Part II: The Communications Tab 
host of friends available. The place where you can access those folks is the 
Contacts app.
	
✓	If you haven’t yet set up a Google account, refer to Chapter 2.
	
✓	Adding more contacts is covered later in this chapter, in the section 
“Adding contacts.”
	
✓	Most apps on the Galaxy Tab use contact information from the Contacts 
app. Those apps include Email, Gmail, Latitude, as well as any app that 
lets you share information, such as photographs or videos.
	
✓	Information from your social networking apps is also coordinated with 
the Contacts app. See Chapter 8 for more information on using the 
Galaxy Tab as your social networking hub.
Using the Contacts app
To peruse the Galaxy Tab address book, start the Contacts app: Touch the 
Apps Menu icon button on the Home screen; then touch the Contacts app 
icon.
The Contacts app shows a list of all contacts in your Galaxy Tab, organized 
alphabetically by first name, similar to the ones shown in Figure 5-1.
Scroll the list by swiping with your finger. Or, you can drag the blue thumb 
button on the left side of the screen to quickly scan through the list, as 
shown in Figure 5-1.
To do anything with a contact, you first have to choose it: Touch a contact 
name, and you see detailed information in the right side of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 5-1. The list of activities you can do with the contact depends 
on the information shown and the apps installed on the tab. Here are some 
options:
Place a phone call: Yes, the Tab is not a phone, but when you install 
Skype, touching a contact’s phone number activates that app, and you 
can use the Tab to make a call. See Chapter 9 for details.
Send e-mail: Touch the contact’s e-mail address to compose an e-mail 
message using either the Gmail or Email app. When the contact has 
more than one e-mail address, you can choose to which one you want to 
send the message. Chapter 6 covers using e-mail on your Tab.

63
 Chapter 5: You Have Friends
View address: When the contact has a home or business address, you 
can choose that item to view the address using the Maps app. You can 
then get directions, look at the place using the Street View tool, or do 
any of a number of interesting things, covered in Chapter 10.
View social networking status: Contacts who are also your social net­
working buddies show their current status, as shown in Figure 5-1. The 
status might also appear at the bottom of the info list, there may be 
a View Profile item to choose, or you may see a Social Network Feeds 
button, which lets you see all of the contact’s social networking status 
updates. See Chapter 8 for more information on social networking with 
the Galaxy Tab.

Part II: The Communications Tab 
Some tidbits of information that show up for a contact don’t have an asso­
ciated action. For example, the Tab doesn’t sing Happy Birthday when you 
touch a contact’s birthday information.
	
✓	Not every contact has a picture, and the picture can come from a 
number of sources (Gmail or Facebook, for example). See the section 
“Add an image for a contact” for more information.
	
✓	In Figure 5-1, the contact is referred to as a joined contact. That means 
that the information you see comes from multiple sources, such as 
Gmail and Facebook. See the section “Joining identical contacts” for 
information on joining contacts.
Sorting your contacts
Your contacts are displayed in the Contacts app in a certain order: alphabeti­
cally by first name, first name first. You can change that order if you like. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	Start the Contacts app.
	
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
	
3.	Choose Settings.
	
	 The Display Options screen appears, which shows you the settings for 
viewing your contacts.
	
4.	Choose the List By command to specify how contacts are sorted: by 
first name or last name.
	
	 The Contacts app is configured to show contacts by first name.
	
5.	Choose Display Contacts By to specify how the contacts appear in the 
list: first name first or last name first.
	
	 The Contacts app shows the contacts listed by first name first.
There’s no right or wrong way to display your contacts — only whichever 
method you’re used to. I prefer them sorted by last name and listed first 
name first.
Searching contacts
You can have a massive number of contacts. Though the Contacts app 
doesn’t provide a running total, I’m certain that I have more than 500 con­
tacts on my Tab. That number combines my Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, and 
other accounts. I have a lot of contacts, and I have the potential for even 
more contacts.

65
 Chapter 5: You Have Friends
	
	 Rather than endlessly scroll the Contacts list and run the risk of rubbing your 
fingers to nubs, you can employ the Galaxy Tab’s powerful Search command. 
Type the name you want to locate in the Find Contacts text box at the top of 
the screen, as shown in Figure 5-1. The list of contacts quickly narrows to 
show only the contacts that contain the text you type.
	
✓	To clear a search, touch the X button, found at the right side of the Find 
Contacts text box.
	
✓	No, there’s no correlation between the number of contacts you have and 
how popular you are in real life.
All Your Friends in the Galaxy Tab
There are two primary things you can do with the Contacts app besides look­
ing up the people you know. The first thing, and possibly the most rewarding 
thing personally, is to add more contacts. The second thing, which is nec­
essary when the first thing becomes wildly successful, is organizing those 
people. This section covers both duties.
Adding contacts
There are more ways to put contacts into your Galaxy Tab than you’re proba­
bly aware of. This section lists a few of the more popular and useful methods.
Create a new contact from scratch
Sometimes it’s necessary to create a contact when you actually meet another 
human being in the real world, or maybe you finally got around to transfer­
ring information into the Tab from your old, paper address book. In either 
instance, you have information to input, and it starts like this:
	
1.	Open the Contacts app.
	
	
2.	Touch the New Contact button.
	
	
	 Refer to Figure 5-1 for the button’s specific location.
	
	
3.	Fill in the information on the New Contact screen as best you can.
	
	 Fill in the text fields with the information you know, as illustrated in 
Figure 5-2.

	 Use the chevron (down-arrow) button to expand an area to see more 
details. To add fields, touch the Plus button; touch the Minus button to 
remove a field.
	
4.	Touch the Done button to complete editing and add the new contact.
The new contact is automatically synched with your Google account. That’s 
one beauty of the Android operating system used by the Galaxy Tab: You 

67
 Chapter 5: You Have Friends
have no need to duplicate your efforts; contacts you create on the Tab are 
instantly updated with your Google account on the Internet.
	
✓	Use the chevron (down-arrow) buttons when you don’t see enough 
fields to add information required for a contact.
	
✓	Touching the triangle buttons (refer to Figure 5-2) displays pop-up 
menus from which you can choose various options, such as setting 
whether a phone number or an e-mail address is Home, Business, or 
what have you.
	
✓	Information from social networking sites is stirred into the Contacts list 
automatically, though sometimes the process creates duplicate entries. 
See the section “Joining identical contacts” for how to remedy such a 
situation.
Create a contact from an e-mail message
Perhaps one of the easiest ways to build up the Contacts list is to create a 
new contact from an e-mail message. Follow these steps when you receive a 
message from someone not already in the Contacts list:
	
1.	Long-press the new contact’s name or e-mail address found at the top 
of the message.
	
2.	Touch the OK button in the Add Contact dialog box.
	
	 The Select a Contact dialog box appears.
	
3.	Choose an existing contact if you merely want to add the e-mail 
address to someone already in the list; otherwise, choose Create a 
New Contact.
	
4.	Fill in the blanks on the New Contact screen, as shown in Figure 5-2.
	
5.	Touch the Done button to finish adding the contact.
Importing contacts from your computer
Your computer’s e-mail program is doubtless a useful repository of contacts 
you’ve built up over the years. You can export these contacts from your com­
puter’s e-mail program and then import them into the Galaxy Tab. It’s not 
easy, but it’s possible.
The key is to save or export your computer e-mail program’s records in the 
vCard (.vcf) file format. These records can then be imported by the Galaxy 
Tab into the Contacts app. The method for exporting contacts varies depend­
ing on the e-mail program:

68
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
✓	In the Windows Live Mail program, choose Go➪Contacts and then 
choose File➪Export➪Business Card (.VCF) to export the contacts.
	
✓	In Windows Mail, choose File➪Export➪Windows Contacts and then 
choose vCards (Folder of .VCF Files) from the Export Windows Contacts 
dialog box. Click the Export button.
	
✓	On the Mac, open the Address Book program and choose 
File➪Export➪Export vCard.
After the vCard files are created on your computer, connect the Galaxy Tab 
to the computer and transfer them. Transferring files from your computer to 
the Galaxy Tab is covered in Chapter 18.
After the vCard files have been copied to the Tab, follow these steps in the 
Contacts app to complete the process:
	
1.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose the Import/Export command.
	
3.	Choose Import from USB Storage.
	
4.	Choose the option Import All vCard Files
	
5.	Touch the OK button.
	
	 The contacts are saved on your Tab but will also be synchronized to 
your Gmail account, which instantly creates a backup copy.
The importing process may create some duplicates. That’s okay: You can join 
two entries for the same person in the Contacts app. See the section “Joining 
identical contacts,” later in this chapter.
Grab contacts from your social networking sites
You can pour your whole gang of friends and followers into the Galaxy Tab 
from your social networking sites. The operation is automatic: Simply add the 
social networking site to the Tab’s inventory of apps as described in Chapter 
8. The social networking contacts are instantly added to the Contacts app 
list.
Find a new contact on the map
When you use the Maps app to locate a coffee house, apothecary, or parole 
office (or all three in one place), you can quickly create a contact for that 
location. Here’s how:

69
 Chapter 5: You Have Friends
	
1.	After searching for your location, touch the cartoon bubble that 
appears on the map.
	
	 You see more details for the location on the left side of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 5-3.
	
2.	Touch the More button, shown in Figure 5-3.
Details about the map location
The More button

70
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
3.	Choose Add As a Contact.
	
	 You see the New Contact screen with much of the information already 
filled-in. That’s because the Maps app shared that info with the Contacts 
app. It’s good when the apps play together nicely.
	
4.	Optionally, add more information if you know it.
	
5.	Touch the Done button.
	
	 The new contact is created.
See Chapter 10 for detailed information on how to search for a location using 
the Maps application.
Editing a contact
	
	 To make minor touch-ups on any contact, start by locating and displaying the 
contact’s information. Touch the Edit Contact icon button, shown in the 
margin, and start making changes.
Change or add information by touching a field and typing on the onscreen 
keyboard. You can edit information as well: Touch the field to edit and 
change whatever you want.
Some information cannot be edited. For example, fields pulled in from social 
networking sites can be edited only by that account holder on the social net­
working site.
When you’re finished editing, touch the Done button.
Add an image for a contact
Nothing can be more delicious than snapping an inappropriate picture of 
someone you know and using the picture as his contact picture on your 
Galaxy Tab. Then, every time he calls you, that embarrassing, potentially 
career-ending photo comes up.
Oh, and I suppose you could use nice pictures as well, but what’s the fun in 
that?
The simplest way to add a picture to one of your Galaxy Tab contacts is to 
have the image already stored in the Tab. You can snap a picture and save 
it (covered in Chapter 11), grab a picture from the Internet (covered in 
Chapter 7), or use any image already stored in the Tab’s Gallery app (cov­
ered in Chapter 12). The image doesn’t even have to be a picture of the 
contact — any image will do.
After the contact’s photo, or any other suitable image, is stored on the Tab, 
follow these steps to update the contact’s information:

71
 Chapter 5: You Have Friends
	
1.	Locate and display the contact’s information.
	
2.	Touch the Edit Contact icon button.
	
3.	Touch the Contact Picture icon.
	
	 Refer to Figure 5-1 for its location.
	
4.	Choose the option Select Photo from Gallery.
	
	 If you have other image management apps on your Tab, you can instead 
choose the app’s command from the list.
	
5.	Choose Gallery.
	
	 The photo gallery is displayed. It lists all photos and videos stored on 
your Galaxy Tab.
	
6.	Browse the photo gallery to look for a suitable image.
	
	 See Chapter 12 for more information on using the Gallery app.
	
7.	Touch the image you want to use for the contact.
	
8.	Crop the image.
	
	 Use Figure 5-4 as a guide for how to crop the image.
Drag cropping box
Crop image
Cancel
Resize cropping box
Figure 5-4: Cropping a contact’s image.

72
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
9.	Touch the OK button.
	
	 The image is cropped but not yet assigned:
	
10.	Touch the Done button to finish editing the contact.
	
	 The image is now assigned, and it appears whenever the contact is refer­
enced on your Galaxy Tab.
	
You can add pictures to contacts on your Google account by using any com­
puter. Just visit your Gmail Contacts list to edit a contact. You can then add 
to that contact any picture stored on your computer. The picture is eventu­
ally synced with the same contact on your Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	If the contact is in your presence, you can always take her picture using 
the Galaxy Tab. After Step 3 in the preceding list, choose the command 
Take Photo or Take New Photo. See Chapter 11 for details on using the 
Galaxy Tab’s camera.
	
✓	Pictures can also be added by your Gmail friends and contacts when 
they add their own images to their accounts.
	
✓	Some images in the Gallery app may not work for contact icons. For 
example, images synchronized with your online photo albums may be 
unavailable.
	
✓	To remove or change a contact’s picture, follow Steps 1 through 3 in the 
preceding list. Choose Remove Photo to get rid of the existing image.
Make a favorite
A favorite contact is someone you stay in touch with most often. The person 
doesn’t have to be someone you like — just someone you (perhaps unfortu­
nately) contact often, such as your bookie.
The favorite contacts are kept in the Starred group, which can be chosen 
from the Contact Groups menu. (Refer to Figure 5-1.) There are also other 
apps and widgets that make use of your favorite contacts.
To add a contact to the Starred group, display the contact’s information and 
touch the Star button by the contact’s image, as shown in Figure 5-1. When 
the star is blue, the contact is one of your favorites and stored in the Starred 
group.
To remove a favorite, touch the contact’s star again, and it loses its color. 
Removing a favorite doesn’t delete the contact but instead removes it from 
the Starred group.
By the way, a contact has no idea whether he’s one of your favorites, so don’t 
believe that you’re hurting his feelings by not making him a favorite.

 Chapter 5: You Have Friends
Manage Your Friends
Nothing is truly perfect the first time, especially when you create things on a 
Galaxy Tab while typing with your thumbs at 34,000 feet during turbulence. 
You can do a whole slate of things with your Galaxy Tab contacts. This sec­
tion covers the more interesting and useful things.
Joining identical contacts
Because the Galaxy Tab can pull contacts from multiple sources (Facebook, 
Gmail, Twitter), you may discover duplicate contact entries in the Contacts 
app. Rather than fuss over which entry to use, you can join the contacts. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	Wildly scroll the Contacts list until you locate a duplicate.
	
	 Well, maybe not wildly scroll, but locate a duplicated entry. Because the 
Contacts list is sorted, the duplicates appear close together (though that 
may not always be the case).
	
2.	Select one of the contacts to view it on the right side of the screen.
	
3.	Touch the Edit Contact button.
	
4.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
5.	Choose Join.
	
	 The Join Contact(s) window appears. It lists any potential matches right 
away based on name matches.
	
6.	Choose an account to join.
	
	 The accounts are merged. Well, they appear together on your Galaxy 
Tab.
	
7.	Touch the Done button to complete the joining.
If you don’t see a matching contact in Step 6, choose the command Show All 
Contacts from the bottom of the Join Contacts window. You can then scroll 
through the entire Contacts list to find a match.
Separating contacts
The topic of separating contacts has little to do with parenting, though sepa­
rating bickering children is the first step to avoiding a fight. Your Galaxy Tab 
contacts might not be bickering, but occasionally the Tab may automatically 
join two contacts that aren’t really the same person. When that happens, you 
can split them by following these steps:

74
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
1.	Display the contact that comes from two separate sources.
	
	 Sometimes it’s difficult to spot such a contact. The easiest way for me is 
to see two diverse e-mail addresses for the contact, which usually indi­
cates a mismatch.
	
2.	Edit the contact by touching the Edit Contact button.
	
3.	Touch the Menu icon button and choose the Separate command.
	
4.	Touch the OK button to confirm that you’re separating the contacts.
	
	 Where there was one contact, there are now two.
You don’t really need to look for improperly joined contacts as much as 
you’ll just stumble across them. When you do, feel free to separate them, 
especially if you detect any bickering.
Removing a contact
Every so often, consider reviewing your contacts. Purge those folks whom 
you no longer recognize or you’ve forgotten. It’s simple:
	
1.	Locate the contact in your Contacts list and display the contact’s 
information.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Delete Contact.
	
4.	Touch OK to remove the contact from your Galaxy Tab.
	
Because the Contacts list is synchronized with your Gmail contacts for your 
Google account, the contact is also removed there.
For some linked accounts, such as Facebook, deleting the account from your 
Tab doesn’t remove the human from your Facebook account. The warning 
that appears (before Step 4 in the preceding list) explains as much.
	
Removing a contact doesn’t kill the person in real life.

I

’ll bet it’s been a long time since you’ve asked someone for his e-mail 
address and he didn’t have one. Probably longer still since someone 
responded, “E-mail? What’s that?” It would probably be odder still if people 
asked why there’s a dash in “e-mail” now, when in my books pub­
lished before 2010 there wasn’t, but I’m getting sidetracked.
To help keep you electronically connected, the Galaxy 
Tab features the ability to collect and send your 
electronic missives. You can read and compose just 
about anywhere you go, peruse attachments, for­
ward messages, and do the entire e-mail e-nchilada 
all in one spot.
Galactic E-Mail
Electronic mail is handled on the Galaxy Tab by two 
apps: Gmail and Email.
The Gmail app hooks directly into your Google Gmail account. 
In fact, they’re exact echoes of each other: The Gmail you receive 
on your computer is also received on your Tab.

76
Part II: The Communications Tab 
You can also use the Email app to connect with non-Gmail electronic mail, 
such as the standard mail service provided by your ISP or a web-based e-mail 
system such as Yahoo! Mail or Windows Live Mail.
Regardless of the app, electronic mail on the Galaxy Tab works just like it 
does on your computer: You can receive mail, create new messages, forward 
e-mail, send messages to a group of contacts, and work with attachments, for 
example. As long as there’s a data connection, e-mail works just peachy.
	
✓	Both the Gmail and Email apps are located on the Apps Menu.
	
✓	There is a shortcut to the Gmail app on the main panel of the Home 
screen. Adding the Email app icon to the Home screen is easy: See 
Chapter 20.
	
✓	The Email app can be configured to handle multiple e-mail accounts, as 
discussed later in this section.
	
✓	Although you can use your Tab’s web browser to visit the Gmail web­
site, you should use the Gmail app to pick up your Gmail.
	
✓	If you forget your Gmail password, visit this web address:
www.google.com/accounts/ForgotPasswd
Setting up an Email account
The Email app is used to access web-based e-mail, or webmail, such as 
Yahoo!, Windows Live, and others. It also lets you read e-mail provided by 
your Internet service provider (ISP), office, or other large, intimidating orga­
nization. To get things set up regardless of the service, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start the Email app.
	
	 Look for it on the Apps Menu, along with all other apps on your Tab.
	
	 If you haven’t yet run the Email app, the first screen you see is Account 
Setup. Continue with Step 2. Otherwise you’re taken to the Email inbox.
	
	 See the next section for information on adding additional e-mail 
accounts.
	
2.	Type the e-mail address you use for the account.
	
3.	Type the password for that account.
	
4.	Touch the Next button.
	
	 If you’re lucky, everything is connected smoothly. Otherwise you’ll 
have to specify the details as provided by your ISP. That includes the 

77
 Chapter 6: Mail of the Electronic Kind
incoming and outgoing server information, often known by the bewilder­
ing acronyms POP3 and SMTP. Plod through the steps on the screen, 
though you’ll primarily need to specify only the incoming and outgoing 
server names.
	
	 Eventually you’ll end up at the Account Options screen.
	
5.	Set the account options on the aptly named Account Options screen.
	
	 You might want to reset the Inbox Checking Frequency to something 
other than 15 minutes.
	
	 If the account is to be your main e-mail account, place a green check 
mark by the option Send Email from this Account by Default.
	
6.	Touch the Next button.
	
7.	Give the account a name and check your own name.
	
	 The account is given the name of the mail server, which may not ring 
a bell with you when it comes to receiving your e-mail. I name my ISP’s 
e-mail account Main because it’s my main account.
	
	 The Your Name field lists your name as it’s applied to outgoing mes­
sages. So if your name is really Wilma Flagstone and not wflag4457, 
you can make that change now.
	
8.	Touch the Next button.
	
	 You’re done.
The next thing you’ll see will be your e-mail account inbox. See the section 
“You’ve Got E-Mail” for what to do next. 
Adding even more e-mail accounts
The Email app can be configured to pick up mail from multiple sources. If 
you have a Yahoo! Mail or Windows Live account, or maybe your corporate 
account, in addition to your ISP’s account, you can add them. Follow through 
with these steps:
	
1.	Visit the Apps Menu and start the Settings app.
	
2.	Choose Accounts & Sync.
	
3.	Touch the Add Account button.
	
4.	If your account type is shown in the list, such as Yahoo! Mail, choose 
it. Otherwise, choose the Email icon.
	
5.	Type the account’s e-mail address.
	
6.	Type the password for the account.

78
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
7.	Touch the Next button.
	
	 In a few magical moments, the e-mail account is configured and added to 
the account list.
	
	 If you goofed up the account name or password, you’re warned: Try 
again. Or if the account requires additional setup, use the information 
provided by the ISP or other source to help you fill in the appropriate 
fields.
	
8.	Set account options.
	
	 Most of the preset choices are fine for a web-based e-mail account.
	
	 If the account is your primary e-mail account, place a green check mark 
by the option Send Email from this Account by Default.
	
	 You might also consider a more frequent update interval, especially if 
you get a lot of mail or need to respond to it quickly.
	
9.	Touch the Next button.
	
10.	Name the account and confirm your name.
	
	 Feel free to change both the account name and your own name.
	
11.	Touch the Next button.
	
	 The account is added to the list on the My Accounts screen.
You can repeat the steps in this section to add more e-mail accounts. All the 
accounts you configure will be made available through the Email app.
You’ve Got E-Mail
The Galaxy Tab works flawlessly with Gmail. In fact, if Gmail is already set up 
to be your main e-mail address, you’ll enjoy having access to your messages 
all the time by using your Tab.
Non-Gmail e-mail, handled by the Email app, must be set up before it can be 
used, as covered earlier in this chapter. After completing the quick and occa­
sionally painless setup, you can receive e-mail on your Tab just as you can on 
a computer.
Getting a new message
You’re alerted to the arrival of a new e-mail message in your Tab by a notifi­
cation icon. The icon differs depending on the e-mail’s source.
	
	 For a new Gmail message, you see the New Gmail notification, shown in the 
margin, appear at the top of the touchscreen.

79
 Chapter 6: Mail of the Electronic Kind
	
	 For a new e-mail message, you see the New Email notification.
Touch the notification icon at the bottom of the screen to see a summary of 
the most recent message. When multiple messages are waiting, you’ll see a 
number indicating how many. Touching the notification’s pop-up window 
takes you to either the Gmail or Email app where you can read the message.
To deal with the new-message notification, drag down the notifications and 
choose the appropriate one. You’re taken directly to your inbox to read the 
new message.
Checking the inbox
To peruse your Gmail, start the Gmail app. You can find it on the main Home 
screen or on the Apps Menu. The Gmail inbox is shown in Figure 6-1.

Notice that your Gmail inbox is missing from the Combined View window. 
(Refer to Figure 6-2.) Gmail is its own app; your Gmail messages don’t show 
up in the universal inbox.
	
✓	See the section “Setting the primary e-mail account” for information on 
setting the primary e-mail account.
	
✓	Search your Gmail messages by pressing the Search button, as shown in 
Figure 6-1.
	
✓	Gmail is organized using labels, not folders. To see your Gmail labels 
from the inbox, touch the Folder Overview button. It’s found in the 
upper-left corner of the screen.
	
✓	The Email app is used to access your primary non-Gmail e-mail account. 
The Messaging app is used to access all non-Gmail accounts.
	
✓	Multiple e-mail accounts gathered in the Email app are color coded. 
When you view the combined inbox (refer to Figure 6-2), you see the 
color codes to the right of each message.
	
✓	Scroll the message list in the Email app to view older messages. The 
Newer and Older buttons move you through the messages one at a time.
Reading an e-mail message
As mail comes in, you can read it by choosing a new e-mail notification, as 
described earlier in this chapter. Reading and working with the message 
operate much the same whether you’re using the Gmail or Email app.
Choose a message to read by touching the message on the left side of the 
screen, as illustrated in Figures 6-1 and 6-2. The message text appears on 
the right side of the window, which you can scroll up or down by using your 
finger.
Use the Newer and Older buttons to page through your messages one at a 
time.

Write That Message
Every so often, someone comes up to me and says, “Dan, you’re a computer 
freak. You probably get a lot of e-mail.” I generally nod and smile. Then the 
person ponders, “How can I get more e-mail?” The answer is simple: To get 
mail, you have to send mail. Or, you can just be a jerk on a blog and leave 
your e-mail address there. That method works too, though I don’t recom­
mend it.

Composing a new message
Crafting an e-mail epistle on your Tab works exactly like creating one on your 
computer. Figure 6-3 shows the basic setup.

Figure 6-3: Writing a new e-mail message.
Here’s how to get there:
	
1.	Start an e-mail app, either Gmail or Email.
	
2.	Touch the Compose icon button.
	
	
	 The button is shown in the margin; it’s the same icon for both apps, as is 
the Compose window, shown in Figure 6-3.
	
3.	Touch the To field and type the e-mail address.
	
	 You can type the first few letters of a contact name and then choose a 
matching contact from the list that’s displayed.

4.	Type a subject.
	
5.	Type the message.
	
6.	Touch the Send button to whisk your missive to the Internet for imme­
diate delivery.
	
	 Or you can touch the Save Draft button (refer to Figure 6-3), and the 
message is stored in the Drafts folder. You can open this folder to edit 
the message. Touch Send to send it.
Copies of the messages you send in the Email program are stored in the Sent 
mailbox. If you’re using Gmail, copies are saved in your Gmail account, which 
you can access from your Galaxy Tab or from any computer or mobile device 
connected to the Internet.
	
	
✓	To cancel a message, touch the Trash button, as shown in the margin. 
Touch the OK button to confirm.
	
	
✓	To summon the Cc field in Gmail, press the +Cc/Bcc button, as shown 
in Figure 6-3. The Cc (Carbon Copy) and Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy) fields 
appear, eager for you to fill them in.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 5 for more information on the Contacts list.
	
✓	Chapter 4 covers typing, voice input, and text editing.
Sending e-mail to a contact
A quick and easy way to compose a new message is to find a contact and 
then create a message using that contact’s information. Heed these steps:
	
1.	Open the Contacts app.
	
	 See Chapter 5 for details.
	
2.	Locate the contact to whom you want to send an electronic message.
	
	 Review Chapter 8 for ways to hunt down contacts in a long list.
	
3.	Touch the contact’s e-mail address.
	
4.	Choose Gmail to send the message using Gmail or touch Email to com­
pose an e-mail message using your main e-mail account.
	
	 Other options may appear on the complete Action Using menu. For 
example, a custom e-mail app you’ve downloaded may show up there as 
well.
At this point, creating the message works as described in the preceding sec­
tion; refer there for additional information.

85
 Chapter 6: Mail of the Electronic Kind
Message Attachments
Attachments on the Galaxy Tab work pretty much the same in both the Gmail 
and Email apps. The key is the paperclip icon, not only for receiving attach­
ments, but for sending them as well.
Dealing with attachments
The Galaxy Tab lets you view or save most e-mail attachments, depending on 
what’s attached. You can also send attachments, though it’s more of a com­
puter activity, not something that’s completely useful on a mobile device; the 
Tab isn’t really designed for creating or manipulating information.
Email messages with attachments are flagged in the inbox with the paperclip 
icon, which seems to be the standard I-have-an-attachment icon for most 
e-mail programs. When you open one of these messages, you may see the 
attachment right away, specifically if it’s a picture.
When you don’t see the attachment right away, you may see one of the 
attachment options illustrated in the earlier Figures 6-1 and 6-2.
	
✓	Touch the Preview button to witness the attachment on your Tab.
	
✓	Touch the View button to download and see the attachment.
	
✓	Touch the Save button to save the attachment without viewing it.
What happens after you touch the Preview or View button depends on the 
type of attachment. Sometimes you see a list of apps from which you can 
choose one to open the attachment. Many Microsoft Office documents are 
opened by the Quickoffice app.
Some attachments cannot be opened. In these cases, use a computer to fetch 
the message and attempt to open the attachment. Or, you can reply to the 
message and inform the sender that you cannot open the attachment on your 
Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	Sometimes, pictures included in an e-mail message aren’t displayed. You 
find the Show Pictures button in the message, which you can touch to 
display the pictures.
	
✓	See Chapter 12 for more information on the Gallery app and how image 
and video sharing works on your Galaxy Tab.

86
Part II: The Communications Tab 
Sending an attachment
The most common thing to send from the Galaxy Tab as an e-mail attachment 
is a picture of video. You’re not limited to only pictures, though. You can 
attach documents you’ve previously saved on the Tab, music, even random 
files if you’re so bold.
The key to adding an attachment to an outgoing message is to touch the 
paperclip icon in the Compose window. This technique works in both the 
Gmail and Email apps. After touching the paperclip icon, you see the Choose 
Attachment menu. The number of items on that menu depends on what’s 
installed on your Galaxy Tab. There are a few basic items:
Gallery: Pluck a picture of video from the Tab’s Gallery app.
Quickoffice: Choose a document that you’ve saved on your Galaxy Tab.
Select music track: Choose music saved on your Galaxy Tab.
Other items: If you’ve installed another photo manager or a file manager, it 
also appears on the list.
The number of items you see depends on what’s installed on the Galaxy Tab. 
Also the variety is different between the Gmail and Email apps.
You’ll use the program you’ve chosen to locate the specific file or media 
tidbit you plan on sending. That item is attached to the outgoing message.
To select more than one attachment, touch the paperclip icon again.
	
It’s also possible to send an attachment by using the various Share com­
mands and buttons located in apps throughout the Galaxy Tab. After choos­
ing the Share command, select Gmail or Email as the app to use for sharing 
whatever it is you want to share.
E-Mail Configuration
You can have oodles of fun and waste oceans of time confirming and custom­
izing the e-mail experience on your Galaxy Tab. The most interesting things 
you can do are to modify or create an e-mail signature, specify how mail you 
retrieve on the Tab is deleted from the server, and assign a default e-mail 
account for the Email app.

87
 Chapter 6: Mail of the Electronic Kind
Creating a signature
I highly recommend that you create a custom e-mail signature for sending 
messages from your Galaxy Tab. Here’s my signature:
DAN
This was sent from my Galaxy Tab.
Typos, no matter how hilarious, are unintentional.
To create a signature for Gmail, obey these directions:
	
1.	Start the Gmail app.
	
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
	
3.	Choose Settings.
	
4.	Choose your Gmail account from the left side of the window.
	
5.	Choose Signature from the bottom part of the scrolling list on the right 
side of the window.
	
6.	Type or dictate your signature.
	
7.	Touch OK.
You can obey these same steps to change your signature; the existing signa­
ture shows up after Step 5.
To set a signature for the Email app, heed these steps:
	
	
1.	In the Email app, touch the Menu icon button.
	
	
2.	Choose Account Settings.
	
	 If you don’t see the Account Settings command, choose a specific 
account from the Account menu (refer to Figure 6-2) or just choose the 
account from the list on the left side of the screen.
	
3.	Choose Signature.
	
4.	Type or dictate your new outgoing e-mail signature.
	
5.	Touch the OK button.
	
When you have multiple e-mail accounts, repeat these steps to configure a 
signature for each one.

88
Part II: The Communications Tab 
Configuring the manual delete option
	
Non-Gmail e-mail you fetch on your Galaxy Tab is typically left on the e-mail 
server. That’s because, unlike your computer’s e-mail program, the Email app 
doesn’t delete messages after it picks them up. The advantage is that you can 
retrieve the same messages later using your computer. The disadvantage is 
that you end up retrieving mail you’ve already read and possibly replied to.
You can control whether the Email app removes messages after they’re 
picked up. Follow these steps:
	
	
1.	In the Email app, touch the Menu icon button.
	
	
2.	Choose Account Settings.
	
3.	If you’re looking at the Combined View, choose a specific account 
from the left side of the Window.
	
	 Specifically, choose the account you use for your ISP. If not, ensure that 
you’re viewing the inbox for the ISP’s e-mail account and then start over 
with Step 1.
	
4.	Choose the command Incoming Settings.
	
5.	Touch the menu next to the item Delete Email From Server.
	
6.	Choose the option When I Delete From Inbox.
	
7.	Touch the Done button.
When you delete a message in the Email app on your Galaxy Tab, the mes­
sage is also deleted from the mail server. It isn’t picked up again, not by the 
Tab, another mobile device, or any computer that fetches e-mail from that 
same account.
	
✓	Mail you retrieve using your computer’s mail program is deleted from 
the mail server after it’s picked up. That’s normal behavior. Your Galaxy 
Tab cannot pick up mail from the server if your computer has already 
deleted it.
	
✓	Deleting mail on the server isn’t a problem for Gmail. No matter how you 
access your Gmail, from your Tab or from a computer, the inbox lists 
the same messages.

89
 Chapter 6: Mail of the Electronic Kind
Setting the primary e-mail account
When you have more than one e-mail account, the main account — the 
default — is the one used by the Email app to send messages. To change that 
primary mail account, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start the Email app.
	
2.	From the Account menu, choose Combined View.
	
	
3.	Touch the Menu icon button and choose Account Settings.
	
	
4.	Choose the e-mail account you want to mark as your favorite from the 
left side of the screen.
	
5.	On the right side of the screen, place a green check mark by the 
Default Account item.
The messages you compose and send using the Email app are sent from the 
account you specified in Step 4.

▶	Sharing and saving web pages
▶	Downloading images and files
▶	Setting a new home page
▶	Configuring the Browser app
T

he World Wide Web was designed to be viewed on a computer. The mon­
itor is big and roomy. Web pages are displayed amply, like Uncle Jeff 
on the sofa watching a ballgame. The smaller the screen, how­
ever, the more difficult it is to view web pages designed for 
those roomy monitors. The web on a cell phone? Tragic. 
But on the Galaxy Tab, the web just seems to fit.
The Galaxy Tab has a nice, roomy screen. Viewing 
the web on the Tab is like seeing a younger, thinner 
version of Uncle Jeff sitting in the Hepplewhite. It’s 
enjoyable, especially when you’ve read the good 
information in this chapter on surfing the web with 
your Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	If possible, activate the Galaxy Tab’s Wi-Fi 
connection before you venture out on the web. 
Though you can use the Tab’s cellular data con­
nection, the Wi-Fi connection incurs no data usage 
charges.
	
✓	Many places you visit on the web can instead be accessed 
directly and more effectively by using specific apps. Facebook, Gmail, 
Twitter, and YouTube, and potentially other popular web destinations, 
have apps that are either preinstalled on the Tab or can be downloaded 
for free from the Android Market. Use them instead of the Browser app.

Mobile Web Browsing
Rare is the person these days who has had no experience with the World 
Wide Web. More common is someone who has used the web on a computer 
but has yet to taste the Internet waters on a mobile device. If that’s you, con­
sider this section your quick mobile web orientation.
Viewing the web
Your Galaxy Tab’s web-browsing app is named Browser. You can find its icon 
on the main Home screen or, like all the other apps on the Tab, it’s on the 
Apps Menu. Figure 7-1 illustrates the Browser app’s interface.

Here are some handy Galaxy Tab web-browsing tips:

93
 Chapter 7: Tablet Web Browsing
	
✓	Pan the web page by dragging your finger across the touchscreen. You 
can pan up, down, left, or right when the page is larger than the Tab’s 
screen.
	
✓	Pinch the screen to zoom out or spread two fingers to zoom in.
	
✓	You can orient the Tab vertically to read a web page in Portrait mode. 
Doing so may reformat some web pages, which can make long lines of 
text easier to read.
Visiting a web page
	
	 To visit a web page, type its address into the Address box. (Refer to Figure 7-1.) 
You can also type a search word or phrase if you don’t know the exact address 
of a web page. Touch the Go button on the onscreen keyboard or the Go 
button by the Address box (see the margin) to search the web or visit a spe­
cific web page.
If you don’t see the Address box, touch the web page’s tab atop the screen. 
The Address box, along with the various buttons left and right, appears on 
the screen.
You “click” links on a page by touching them with your finger. If you have 
trouble stabbing the right link, zoom in on the page and try again.
	
✓	When typing a web page address, use the www. key to instantly type 
those characters for the address. The www. key changes to the .com key 
to assist you in rapidly typing those characters as well.
	
✓	To reload a web page, touch the Refresh symbol on the left end of the 
Address bar.
	
✓	To stop a web page from loading, touch the X that appears to the left of 
the Address bar. The X replaces the Refresh button and appears only 
when a web page is loading.
Browsing back and forth
	
	 To return to a web page, you can touch the Browser’s Back button, shown 
here and in Figure 7-1, or press the Back icon button at the bottom of the 
screen.
Touch the Browser’s Forward button to go forward or to return to a page you 
were visiting before you touched the Back button.

94
Part II: The Communications Tab 
To review the long-term history of your web-browsing adventures, touch the 
Bookmarks button in the upper-left corner of the Browser window, as shown 
in Figure 7-2. Choose History to view your web-browsing history.

To clear the History list, touch the Menu icon button, shown in Figure 7-2, 
and choose the Clear History command.
Using bookmarks
Bookmarks are those electronic breadcrumbs you can drop as you wander 
the web. Need to revisit a website? Just look up its bookmark. This advice 
assumes, of course, that you bother to create (I prefer drop) a bookmark 
when you first visit the site.

95
 Chapter 7: Tablet Web Browsing
The cinchy way to bookmark a page is to touch the Favorite (star) icon on 
the right end of the Address bar. Tap that icon, and you see the Bookmark 
This Page window, shown in Figure 7-3.
Edit this to make it shorter
Leave this alone
Choose where to save the bookmark
Figure 7-3: Adding a bookmark.
I edit the Label to something shorter, especially if the web page’s title is long. 
Shorter names look better on the Bookmarks window. (Refer to Figure 7-3.) 
Touch the OK button and you’ve added the bookmark.
After the bookmark is set, it appears in the list of bookmarks. To see the list, 
touch the Bookmarks button on the Browser app’s main window. (Refer to 
Figure 7-1.) You see a list of web page thumbnails with their labels or titles 
beneath. Swipe the list downward to see more bookmarks and thumbnails.
Touch a bookmark to visit that page.
	
✓	You can add a bookmark to the Home screen by touching the Add To 
menu in the Bookmark This Page window. Choose Home Screen from the 
menu.
	
✓	Remove a bookmark by long-pressing its entry in the Bookmarks list. 
Choose the command Delete Bookmark. Touch the OK button to con­
firm. The bookmark is gone.
	
✓	Bookmarked websites can also be placed on the Home screen: Long-
press the bookmark thumbnail and choose the command Add Shortcut 
to Home.
	
	
✓	The MyBookmarks app, available at the Android Market, can import 
your Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome bookmarks from your 
Windows computer into the Galaxy Tab. See Chapter 16 for more infor­
mation on the Android Market.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 4 for information on editing text on the Galaxy Tab.

96
Part II: The Communications Tab 
Managing web pages in multiple tabs
The Browser app uses a tabbed interface to display more than one web page 
at a time. Refer to Figure 7-1 to see various tabs marching across the Browser 
app’s screen, just above the Address bar.
Here’s how you work the tabbed interface: 
	
✓	To open a blank tab, touch the plus button to the right of the last tab, as 
shown in Figure 7-1.
	
✓	To open a link in a new tab, long-press that link. Choose the command 
Open in New Tab from the menu that appears.
	
✓	To open a bookmark in a new window, long-press the bookmark and 
choose the command Open in New Tab.
You switch between tabs by choosing one from the top of the screen.
Close a tab by touching its X (Close) button; you can close only the tab 
you’re currently viewing.
	
✓	The tabs keep marching across the screen, left to right. You can scroll 
the tabs to view the ones that have scrolled off the screen.
	
✓	New tabs open using the home page that’s set for the Browser applica­
tion. See the section “Setting a home page,” later in this chapter, for 
information.
	
✓	For secure browsing, you can open an incognito tab: Press the Menu 
icon button and choose the command New Incognito Tab. When you go 
incognito, the Browser app won’t track your history, leave cookies, or 
other evidence of which web pages you’ve visited in the incognito tab. 
A short description appears on the incognito tab page describing how it 
works.
Searching the web
The handiest way to find things on the web is to use the Google widget, shown 
in Figure 7-4. That widget doesn’t come preinstalled on any Home screen panel, 
so you’ll have to add it per the fine directions found in Chapter 20.
Figure 7-4: The Google widget.

97
 Chapter 7: Tablet Web Browsing
	
	 To search for something anytime you’re viewing a web page in the Browser 
app, touch the Search icon button, found on the right end of the Address bar. 
Type the search term into the Address box. You can choose from a list of 
suggestions.
To find text on the web page you’re looking at, as opposed to searching the 
entire Internet, follow these steps:
	
1.	Visit the web page where you want to find a specific tidbit o’ text.
	
	
2.	Press the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Find on Page.
	
4.	Type the text you’re searching for.
	
5.	Use the left- or right-arrow button to locate that text on the page — 
backward or forward, respectively.
	
	 The found text appears highlighted in green.
	
6.	Touch the X (Done) button when you’re done searching.
	
The Google Search app, found on the Apps Menu, works like a full-screen ver­
sion of the Google widget. Use the app to search the web.
Sharing a page
There it is! That web page that you just have to talk about to everyone you 
know. The gauche way to share the page is to copy and paste it. Because 
you’re reading this book, though, you know the better way to share a web 
page. Heed these steps:
	
1.	Go to the web page you want to share.
	
2.	Press the Menu icon button and choose the Share Page command.
	
	 The Share Via menu appears, listing apps and methods by which you 
can share the page, as shown in Figure 7-5.
	
	 The variety and number of items on the Share Via menu depend on the 
applications installed on your Tab. For example, you might see Twitter 
or Facebook appear, if you’ve set up those social networking sites as 
covered in Chapter 8.
	
3.	Choose a method to share the link.
	
	 For example, choose Email to send the link by mail, or Twitter to share 
the link with your followers.
	
4.	Do whatever happens next.
	
	 Whatever happens next depends on how you’re sharing the link: 
Compose the e-mail, create a comment in Facebook, or whatever. Refer 
to various chapters in this book for specific directions.

98
Part II: The Communications Tab 
Figure 7-5: Options for sharing a web page.
Saving a web page
I like to save some web pages for later reading. It’s not an obvious thing to 
do, but I save the web pages of long diatribes or interesting text so that I 
can read them later, such as when I’m cooped up in an airplane for a cross-
country trip, sitting around bored at the car repair shop, or visiting other 
locations where time slows and boredom grows.
To save a web page, follow these steps:
	
1.	Visit the page you want to save.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button and choose the command Save Page.
	
	 The page is downloaded to the Tab’s internal storage.
The web page is saved in the download folder. You can view the page by 
opening the Downloads app and then choosing the page from the Downloads 
list.
	
✓	Web pages you save are given the same name or title as the web 
page itself. Look for that title in the list presented when you open the 
Downloads app.

99
 Chapter 7: Tablet Web Browsing
	
✓	See the later section “Reviewing your downloads” for more information 
about the Downloads app.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 19 for information on using your Galaxy Tab on an 
airplane.
The Art of Downloading
There’s nothing to downloading, other than understanding that most people 
use the term without knowing exactly what it means. Officially, a download is 
a transfer of information over a network from another source to your gizmo. 
For your Galaxy Tab, that network is the Internet, and the other source is a 
web page.
	
	
✓	The Downloading complete notification appears after the Galaxy Tab 
has downloaded something. You can choose that notification to view the 
download.
	
✓	There’s no need to download program files to the Galaxy Tab. If you 
want new software, you can obtain it from the Android Market, covered 
in Chapter 16.
	
✓	Most people use the term download to refer to copying or transferring a 
file or other information. That’s technically inaccurate, but the descrip­
tion passes for social discussion.
	
✓	The opposite of downloading is uploading. That’s the process of sending 
information from your gizmo to another location on a network.
Grabbing an image from a web page
The simplest thing to download is an image from a web page. It’s cinchy: 
Long-press the image. You see a pop-up menu appear, from which you 
choose the command Save Image.
To view images you download from the web, you use the Gallery app. 
Downloaded images are saved in the Download album.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 12 for information on the Gallery.
	
✓	Technically, the image is stored on the Tab’s internal storage. It can be 
found in the download folder. You can read about Galaxy Tab file stor­
age in Chapter 18.

Downloading a file
The web is full of links that don’t open in a web browser window. For 
example, some links automatically download, such as links to PDF files or 
Microsoft Word documents or other types of files that can’t be displayed by a 
web browser. Such links are automatically downloaded.
To save other types of links that aren’t automatically downloaded, long-press 
the link and choose the command Save Link from the menu that appears. If 
the Save Link command doesn’t appear, the Galaxy Tab is unable to save the 
file, either because the file is of an unrecognized type or because there could 
be a security issue.
	
✓	You can view the saved file by using the Downloads app. See the next 
section.
	
✓	The Quickoffice app is used on the Galaxy Tab to display PDF and 
Microsoft Office files.
Reviewing your downloads
The Browser app keeps a list of all the stuff you download from the web. To 
review your download history, open the Downloads app on the Apps Menu 
screen. You’ll see the list of downloads sorted by date, as shown in Figure 7-6.

 Chapter 7: Tablet Web Browsing
To view a download, choose it from the list. The Galaxy Tab opens the appro­
priate app to view the download.
	
✓	The Download Manager also lists any web pages you’ve downloaded.
	
✓	To remove an item from the Downloads list, place a green check mark 
in its box, as shown in Figure 7-6. Touch the Trash icon at the top of the 
screen to remove that download.
	
✓	Sharing a downloaded item is done by placing a green check mark by 
the downloaded file and choosing the Share icon button at the top of the 
screen. (Refer to Figure 7-6.)
	
✓	You can quickly review any download by choosing the Download 
notification.
Browser Controls and Settings
More options and settings and controls exist for the Browser app than just 
about any other app I’ve used on the Galaxy Tab. It’s complex. Rather than 
bore you with every dang doodle detail, I thought I’d present just a few of the 
options worthy of your attention.
Setting a home page
The home page is the first page you see when you start the Browser app, and 
it’s the first page that’s loaded when you fire up a new tab. To set your home 
page, heed these directions:
	
1.	Browse to the page you want to set as the home page.
	
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Settings.
	
	 The Settings screen appears.
	
4.	Choose General on the left side of the screen.
	
5.	Choose Set Home Page.
	
6.	Touch the Current Page button.
	
7.	Touch OK.
	
	 The home page is set.

102
Part II: The Communications Tab 
I changed the home page on my Tab because it was preset to my cellular pro­
vider’s page, and that page took forever to load. Remember: You don’t have 
to use your cellular provider’s home page.
	
If you want your home page to be blank (not set to any particular web page), 
type about:blank in the text box instead of touching the Current Page button. 
(Refer to Step 6.) That’s the word about, a colon, and then the word blank, 
with no period at the end and no spaces in the middle. I prefer a blank home 
page because it’s the fastest web page to load. It’s also the web page with the 
most accurate information.
Changing the way the web looks
You can do a few things to improve the way the web looks on your Galaxy 
Tab. First and foremost, don’t forget that you can orient the device horizon­
tally and vertically, which rearranges the way a web page is displayed.
From the Settings screen, you can also adjust the zoom setting used to dis­
play a web page. Heed these steps when using the Browser app:
	
	
1.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose Advanced from the left side of the screen.
	
4.	On the right side of the screen, choose Default Zoom.
	
5.	Choose a setting.
	
	 There are three options: Far, Medium, and Close for tiny, normal, and 
larger sized web pages, respectively.
	
The Close setting might not be “big” enough, so remember that you can 
spread your fingers to zoom in on any web page.
You can also choose the Text Size command from the Advanced screen. That 
command changes the way text appears on a web page. There are five set­
tings: Tiny through Huge.
Setting privacy and security options
With regard to security, my advice is always to be smart and think before 
doing anything questionable on the web. Use common sense. One of the most 
effective ways that the Bad Guys win is by using human engineering to try to 
trick you into doing something you normally wouldn’t do, such as click a link 

103
 Chapter 7: Tablet Web Browsing
to see a cute animation or a racy picture of a celebrity or politician. As long 
as you use your noggin, you should be safe.
As far as the Galaxy Tab’s browser settings go, most of the security options 
are already enabled for you, including the blocking of pop-up windows 
(which normally spew ads).
If web page cookies concern you, you can clear them from the Settings 
window. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding section and choose Privacy & 
Security from the left side of the screen. Touch the option Clear All Cookie 
Data.
You can also choose the command Clear Form Data and remove the check 
mark from Remember Forum Data. These two settings prevent any text 
you’ve typed into a text field from being summoned automatically by some­
one who may steal your Tab.
You might be concerned about various warnings regarding location data. 
What they mean is that the Galaxy Tab can take advantage of your location 
on Planet Earth (using the GPS or satellite position system) to help locate 
businesses and people near you. I see no security problem in leaving that 
feature on, though you can disable location services from the Browser app’s 
Settings screen, Privacy & Security page: Remove the check mark by Enable 
Location. You can also choose the item Clear Location Access to wipe out 
any information saved in the Tab and used by certain web pages.
See the earlier section, “Browsing back and forth,” for steps on clearing your 
web-browsing history.

The Digital Social Life
In This Chapter
▶	Accessing social updates for your contacts
▶	Getting Facebook on the Galaxy Tab
▶	Sharing your life on Facebook
▶	Sending pictures to Facebook
▶	Tweeting on Twitter
▶	Exploring other social networking opportunities
A

t the dawn of the Internet, there was no reason to use the Internet. 
Well, yes: It was a time-killer. Then came the glory of e-mail, the thrill of 
online shopping, the tedium of blogging. At the end of the first decade of the 
21st century, there was another reason: online social networking.
Armed with your Galaxy Tab, you can keep your digital 
social life up-to-date wherever you go. You can communi­
cate with your friends, followers, and buddies; let them 
know where you are; upload pictures and videos you 
take on the Tab; or just share your personal, private, 
intimate thoughts with all of humanity.
In Your Facebook
Of all the social networking sites, Facebook is the 
king. It’s the online place to go to catch up with 
friends, send messages, express your thoughts, share 
pictures and video, play games, and waste more time than 
you ever thought you had.

106
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
✓	Though you can access Facebook on the web by using the Browser app, 
I highly recommend that you use the Facebook app described in this 
section.
	
✓	You can access updates to your contacts’ Facebook statuses from the 
Contacts app. See Chapter 5.
	
✓	Facebook is one of the most popular sites on the Internet at the time 
this book goes to press. On some days, it sees more Internet traffic than 
Google.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab is supposed to ship with a social networking app called 
the Social Hub. As this book goes to press, that app is not available. If it 
becomes available in the future, check my website for an update:
www.wambooli.com/help/galaxytab
Setting up your Facebook account
The best way to use Facebook is to have a Facebook account, and the best 
way to do that is to sign up at www.facebook.com by using your computer. 
Register for a new account by setting up your username and password.
	
Don’t forget your Facebook username and password!
Eventually, the Facebook robots send you a confirmation e-mail. You reply to 
that message, and the online social networking community braces itself for 
your long-awaited arrival.
After you’re all set up, you’re ready to access Facebook on your Galaxy Tab. 
To get the most from Facebook, you need a Facebook app. Keep reading in 
the next section.
Getting the Facebook app
The Galaxy Tab doesn’t come with a Facebook app, but you can get the 
Facebook app for free from the Android Market. That app is your red carpet 
to the Facebook social networking kingdom.
	
	 To get the Facebook app, you can scan the barcode shown in the margin. Or, 
you can go to the Android Market and search for the Facebook for Android 
app. See Chapter 16.

107
 Chapter 8: The Digital Social Life
Running Facebook on your Galaxy Tab
You access Facebook by running the Facebook app. If you can’t find the 
Facebook app, you need to install it; refer to the preceding section.
The first time you behold the Facebook app, you’ll probably be asked to log 
in. Do so: Type the e-mail address you used to sign up for Facebook and then 
type your Facebook password. Touch the Login button.
If you’re asked to sync your contacts, do so. I recommend choosing the 
option Sync All, which brings in all your Facebook friends to the Tab’s 
Contacts list. Touch the Finish button to begin using Facebook.
Eventually, you see the Facebook news or status updates feed. To go to the 
main Facebook page, shown in Figure 8-1, touch the Back icon button.

	 When you’re done using Facebook, touch the Home icon button to return to 
the Home screen.
The Facebook app continues to run until you either sign out or turn off the 
Galaxy Tab. To sign out of Facebook, touch the Menu icon button (at the 
bottom of the screen) and choose the Logout command.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 20 for information on placing a Facebook app shortcut 
on the Home screen.
	
✓	Also see Chapter 20 for information on adding a widget to the Home 
screen. The Facebook app comes with a widget that displays recent 
status updates and allows you to share your thoughts directly from the 
Home screen.
	
✓	To see more details on an item in the News Feed, choose that item. It 
appears on another screen, along with the details.
	
✓	The News Feed is updated when you swipe down on the screen.
	
	
✓	Notifications for Facebook appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown 
in the margin.
Setting your status
The primary thing you live for on Facebook, besides having more friends 
than anyone else, is to update your status. It’s the best way to share your 
thoughts with the universe, far cheaper than skywriting and far less offensive 
than a robocall.
To set your status on the Galaxy Tab, follow these steps in the Facebook app:
	
1.	View the News Feed.
	
2.	Touch the Status button at the top of the screen.
	
	 You see the Update Status screen, where you can type your musing, 
similar to what’s shown in Figure 8-2.
	
3.	Type something pithy, newsworthy, or typical of the stuff you read in 
Facebook.
	
4.	Touch the Post button.
You can also set your status by using the Facebook widget on the home page, 
if it’s been installed: Touch the What’s on Your Mind text box, type your 
important news tidbit, and touch the Share button.

Uploading a picture to Facebook
One of the many things your Galaxy Tab can do is take pictures. Combine 
that feature with the Facebook app, and you have an all-in-one gizmo 
designed for sharing the various intimate and private moments of your life 
with the ogling throngs of the Internet.
The key to sharing a picture on Facebook is to locate the wee Camera icon, 
which is found on the Update Status screen. (Refer to Figure 8-2.) There’s 
also a Photo button on the News Feed screen. Sharing a picture works simi­
larly no matter where you start.
Here’s how to work that button and upload an image or a video to Facebook:
	
1.	Touch the big Photo button on the News Feed screen.
	
2.	Choose Photo.
	
3.	Choose an option from the Upload Photo menu.
	
	 You have two options for uploading a picture:
	
	 Choose from Gallery: If you choose this option, browse the Gallery app to 
look for the picture you want to upload. (See Chapter 12 for more infor­
mation on how the Gallery app works.)

110
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
	 Capture a Photo: Use the Galaxy Tab’s camera to snap a picture of what­
ever is around you. Touch the Shutter button to snap the picture; touch 
Save to continue or Discard to start over and take a new picture. (See 
Chapter 11 for more information on how to use the Camera app.)
	
	 After selecting or taking a picture, the image appears as a thumbnail on 
the Write Post screen, which looks nearly identical to the Update Status 
screen, shown earlier in Figure 8-2.
	
4.	Optionally, type some text to accompany the image.
	
5.	Touch the Post button.
	
	 The image is posted as soon as it’s transferred over the Internet and 
digested by Facebook.
The image can be found as part of your status update/News Feed, but it’s also 
saved to the Mobile Uploads album.
When you choose Video in Step 2, things work pretty much the same; refer to 
Chapter 11 for more details on using the Galaxy Tab as a video camera.
	
✓	You can use the Facebook app to view the image in Facebook, or you 
can use Facebook on any computer connected to the Internet.
	
✓	To view your Facebook photo albums, choose Profile from the main 
Facebook screen and then choose Photos from the bottom of your pro­
file page. Choose an album to view the photos. 
	
✓	Facebook also appears on the various Share menus you find on the 
Galaxy Tab. Choose Facebook from the Share menu to send to Facebook 
whatever it is you’re looking at. (Other chapters in this book give you 
more information about the various Share menus and where they 
appear.)
Configuring the Facebook app
	
	 The commands that control Facebook are stored on the Settings screen, 
which you access by touching the Menu icon button while viewing the main 
Facebook screen and choosing the Settings command.
Choose Refresh Interval to specify how often the Tab checks for new 
Facebook activities. You might find the one-hour value to be too long for 
your active Facebook social life, so choose something quicker. Or, to disable 
Facebook notifications, choose Never.
The following two options determine how the Galaxy Tab reacts to Facebook 
updates:

111
 Chapter 8: The Digital Social Life
Vibrate: Vibrates the Tab
Notification Ringtone: Plays a specific ringtone
For the notification ringtone, choose the Silent option when you want the Tab 
not to make noise upon encountering a Facebook update.
	
	 Touch the Back icon button to close the Settings screen and return to the 
main Facebook screen.
Tweet Suite
Twitter is a social networking site, similar to Facebook but far briefer. On 
Twitter, you write short spurts of text that express your thoughts or observa­
tions, or you share links. Or, you can just use Twitter to follow the thoughts 
and twitterings, or tweets, of other people.
	
✓	A message posted on Twitter is a tweet.
	
✓	A tweet can be no more than 140 characters long. That number includes 
spaces and punctuation.
	
✓	You can post messages on Twitter and follow others who post messages.
	
✓	They say that of all the people who have accounts on Twitter, only a 
small portion of them actively use the service.
	
✓	I’m not a big fan of Twitter. Even more so than Facebook, Twitter seems 
to exist to sate some people’s craving for attention. It provides the 
bricks that pave the road to pseudo-fame, so a lot of what I read on 
Twitter seems to me to be self-centered junk. Then again, I’ve seen some 
good news feeds on Twitter, so I don’t dislike it completely.
Setting up Twitter
The best way to use Twitter on the Galaxy Tab is to already have a Twitter 
account. Start by going to http://twitter.com on a computer and follow­
ing the directions there for creating a new account.
	
	 After you’ve established a Twitter account, obtain the Twitter app for your 
Galaxy Tab. The app can be obtained from the Android Market. Use the QR 
code in the margin to get a quick link to the app. (Refer to Chapter 16 for 
additional information on downloading apps to your Galaxy Tab.)

112
Part II: The Communications Tab 
When you start the Twitter app for the first time, touch the Sign In button. 
Type your Twitter username or e-mail address and then type your Twitter 
password. After that, you can use Twitter without having to log in again — 
until you turn off the Tab or exit the Twitter app.
Figure 8-3 shows the Twitter app’s main screen, which shows the current 
tweet feed.

Tweeting
The Twitter app provides an excellent interface to the many wonderful and 
interesting things that Twitter does. Of course, the two most basic tasks are 
reading and writing tweets.
To read tweets, choose the Timeline as shown in Figure 8-3. Recent tweets 
are displayed in a list, with the most recent information at the top. Scroll the 
list by swiping it with your finger.

✓	You have only 140 characters for creating your tweet. That includes 
spaces.
	
✓	The character counter in the Twitter app lets you know how close 
you’re getting to the 140-character limit.
	
✓	Twitter itself doesn’t display pictures, other than your account picture. 
When you send a picture to Twitter, you use an image-hosting service 
and then share the link, or URL, to the image. All that complexity is han­
dled by the Twitter app.
	
✓	The Twitter app appears on various Share menus in other apps on your 
Galaxy Tab. You use those Share menus to send to Twitter whatever 
you’re looking at.

114
Part II: The Communications Tab 
Even More Social Networking
The Internet is nuts over social networking. Facebook may be the king, but 
there are lots of landed gentry out for that crown. It almost seems as though 
a new social networking site pops up every week. Beyond Facebook and 
Twitter, other social networking sites include, but are not limited to,
	
✓	Google+
	
✓	Latitude
	
✓	LinkedIn
	
✓	Meebo
	
✓	Myspace
I recommend first setting up the social networking account on your com­
puter, similar to the way I describe it earlier in this chapter for Facebook 
and Twitter. After that, obtain an app for the social networking site using the 
Android Market. Set up and configure that app on your Galaxy Tab to con­
nect with your existing account.
	
✓	See Chapter 16 for more information on the Android Market.
	
✓	Latitude is Google’s social networking app that lets you share your loca­
tion with your Google friends. You can also use Latitude to find your 
Google friends, meet up, or avoid them completely.
	
✓	As with Facebook and Twitter, you may find your social networking apps 
appearing on various Share menus on the Galaxy Tab. That way, you 
can easily share your pictures and other types of media with your online 
social networking pals.

E

ven though it’s not a phone, your Galaxy Tab has a phone 
number. Well, if it’s a non–Wi-Fi Tab, then it has a phone 
number. That number was assigned when you first bought 
the Tab, and it’s used for billing purposes only. Such a 
situation might lead you to believe that the Galaxy Tab 
is utterly incapable of making phone calls. Oh, boy. Is 
that assumption ever incorrect.
Armed with the proper app, your Galaxy Tab can 
indeed make phone calls. Not only that, it can make 
video phone calls as well. They’re not really true 
video calls, like the ones Walt Disney promised 
people in the 1960s, but they’re a way to chat with 
other human beings while seeing them live on the 
Galaxy Tab screen. This chapter explains how it all 
works.

116
Part II: The Communications Tab 
Google Can Talk and Look and Listen
I blame that front-facing camera. I mean, what’s the point of having a front-
facing camera unless you can do video chat? Sure, you can take pictures of 
yourself (self-portraits), which is covered in Chapter 11. But video chat is the 
new rage on mobile devices.
To answer the video chat call, you run the Google Talk app. It’s rather limited 
in that you can video (and text) chat only with your Google contacts who’ve 
also configured Google Chat, but hey: That’s good enough for me!
	
Google Talk started out as an extension of Gmail on the Internet, primarily as 
a way to instantly text chat with your Google friends. Eventually they added 
video chat and, lo, over all these years, video chat is now available on the 
Galaxy Tab.
Using Google Talk
Get started with Google Talk by starting the Talk app on your Galaxy Tab. 
Like all the apps, it’s located on the Apps Menu, though you may be lucky 
and find a Talk app shortcut right on the main Home screen.
When you start the Talk app the first time, you’re prompted to sign in using 
your Google account: Touch the Sign In button. That’s it for the not-quite-
painful setup.
After signing in, you see the main Talk screen, shown in Figure 9-1. Your 
Google contacts who have activated Google Talk, either on their computer or 
on a mobile gizmo like the Galaxy Tab, appear on the left side of the screen.
You can do three things with your friends while using the Talk app: Text 
chat, voice chat, and video chat. But before you do any of that, you need to 
get some friends.
To sign out of Google Talk, touch the Talk icon button in the upper-left 
corner of the screen. On the main Talk screen, touch the Sign Out button.
	
✓	You can redisplay your account Status by choosing your account from 
the Friends list, such as my account being chosen in Figure 9-1.
	
✓	You can touch the gray Status Message box to type in a new status for 
your account. For example, when I was writing this book, my status was, 
“I’m writing a book! Please chat with me!” Though that status wasn’t 
very effective.

117

Message box. There are three status icons: Available, Busy, and Invisible.

Getting friends on Google Talk
Yeah, it happens: You don’t have any friends. Well, at least you don’t have 
any friends showing up in the Friends list in Google Talk. You can easily fix 
that problem: Touch the Invite Friends button, as shown in Figure 9-1. Type 
the friend’s e-mail address and touch the Send Invitation button to send that 
person an invite.
You’ll receive a reply to your invitation on a mobile device running the Talk 
app or on a computer with the Gmail web page open. When you receive the 
invitation, you find it listed in the Friends list. Initiations have the heading 
Chat Invitation.
To accept an incoming invitation, touch the Chat Invitation item in your 
Friends list. You see the Accept Invitation dialog box. Touch the Accept 
button to confirm your friendship and, eventually, chat with that person.

118
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
Your friends can be on a computer or mobile device to use Google Talk; it 
doesn’t matter which. But they must have a camera available to enable video 
chat.
Typing at your friends
The most basic form of communications with the Talk app is text chatting. 
That means typing at another person, which is probably one of the oldest 
forms of communications on the Internet. It’s also the most tedious, so I’ll be 
brief.
You start text chatting by touching a contact in the Friends list. Type your 
message as shown in Figure 9-2. Touch the Send button to send your 
comment.

Close
Video chat

You type, your friend types, and so on until you get tired or the Tab runs out 
of battery juice.
When you’re done talking, touch the X (Close) button, as illustrated in 
Figure 9-2. Or you can just choose another friend from the list and chat with 
him. Or you can touch your own name on the list, which shows your current 
status.
Resume any conversation by choosing that same contact from the Friends 
list.

 Chapter 9: Phone Calls and Video Chat
Talking and video chat
Take the conversation up a notch by touching the Voice or Video button on 
the right side of the text chat window. (Refer to Figure 9-2.) When you do, 
your friend receives an invite pop-up and Talk notification. Or if a friend is 
asking you to voice or video chat, you see the pop-up. Touch the Accept 
button to begin talking.
Figure 9-3 shows a video chat. The person you’re talking with appears in the 
big window; you’re in the smaller window. With the connection made and the 
invite accepted, you can begin enjoying video chat.

To end the conversation, touch the X (Close) button. Well, say “Goodbye” 
first and then touch the X button.
	
✓	When you’re nude or just don’t want to video chat, touch the Decline 
button for the video chat invite. Then choose that contact and reply 
with a text message or voice chat instead.
	
✓	You can disable incoming voice and video chats by deselecting the 
Allow Video and Voice Chats item on your Talk account’s Status screen. 
Refer to Figure 9-1.

Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab’s front-facing camera is at the top center of the Tab. If 
you want to make eye contact, look directly into the camera, though 
when you do you won’t be able to see the other person.
Connect to the World with Skype
Perhaps the most versatile app for converting the phoneless Galaxy Tab into 
a phone is Skype. It’s one of the most popular Internet communications pro­
grams, allowing you to text, voice, or video chat with others on the Internet 
as well as use the Internet to make real, honest-to-goodness phone calls.
Obtaining a Skype account
Get started with Skype by creating an account. I recommend visiting www.
skype.com on a computer, where you can enjoy the full screen and key­
board, though you can use the Browser on the Galaxy Tab if you’ve com­
pletely shunned computers.
At the Skype website, click the Join Skype button or, if the page has been 
updated since this book went to press, find and click a similar-sounding 
button. Sign up according to the directions offered on the website.
After you have a Skype account, the next step is to obtain a copy of the Skype 
app for your Galaxy Tab, as covered in the next section.
	
✓	As with other web services, you create a Skype name to identify your 
user account. It’s the name you use to identify yourself to others who 
use Skype.
	
✓	If you want to use Skype to place phone calls, you need to stuff some 
cash into your account. Log in to the Skype website and follow the direc­
tions for getting Skype Credit.
	
✓	There’s no charge for using Skype to chat with other Skype users. As 
long as you know the other party’s Skype name, connecting and chatting 
is simple. See the later section, “Chatting with another Skype user.”
Getting Skype for the Galaxy Tab
	
	 Your Galaxy Tab doesn’t come with Skype software preinstalled. To get 
Skype, saunter on over to the Android Market and download the app. If you 
have a barcode–scanning app, you can also scan the icon in the margin, as 
described in this book’s Introduction.

 Chapter 9: Phone Calls and Video Chat
After installing Skype on your Tab, follow these steps to get started:
	
1.	Start the Skype app.
	
2.	Read through the initial, informational screens.
	
	 You can’t make emergency calls using Skype.
	
3.	Type in your account name and password.
	
4.	Touch the Sign In button.
	
	 You may be asked to accept the terms of agreement; do so. There may 
be a tour presented that previews how Skype works. Feel free to skip the 
tour.
One of the biggest questions you’re asked when you first run the Skype app 
on your Galaxy Tab is whether you want to synchronize your contacts. I rec­
ommend choosing the preset option, Sync With Existing Contacts. Touch the 
Continue button.
The main Skype screen is shown in Figure 9-4. The Contacts button lists 
people and phone numbers you’ve connected with on Skype. The later sec­
tion, “Building your Skype Contacts list,” describes how to get more contacts 
than just Skype Test Call.

The Skype app stays active the entire time your Tab is on. If you desire to 
sign out of Skype, follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Profile button on the Skype app’s main screen.
	
	 Refer to Figure 9-4.
	
	
2.	Touch the bottom Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Sign Out.
	
4.	Touch the Yes button.
You’re prompted to sign back in to Skype the next time you run the app.
	
	
✓	To quickly access Skype, touch the Skype notification, shown in the 
margin.
	
	
✓	You can make calls to phones on Skype only when you’ve added Skype 
Credit to your account.
Managing your Skype status
You have two ways to present yourself to the Skype universe. The first is 
your Skype mood, a message that’s always displayed. The second is the 
Skype status, which tells the Skype-o-verse how open you are to receiving 
new calls.
To set either your mood or status, touch the Profile button on the main 
Skype screen. (Refer to Figure 9-4.)
Set your mood by touching the mood message next to your account picture. 
Type in some text using the onscreen keyboard.
Set your status by touching the Status button at the top of the screen, illus­
trated earlier in Figure 9-4. A toolbar with a variety of status icons appears, 
describing whether you’re open for calls, away, or prefer not to be bothered.
The Profile screen also lists how much Skype Credit you have. To purchase 
more credit, touch the Skype Credit button, whip out your credit card, and 
follow the directions on the screen.

123
 Chapter 9: Phone Calls and Video Chat
Building your Skype Contacts list
Text, voice, and video chat on Skype over the Internet are free. If you can 
use a Wi-Fi connection, you can chat without incurring a loss of your cellular 
plan’s data quota. Before you can talk, however, you need to connect with 
another Skype user.
Yes, the other person must have a Skype account. Further, the person must 
agree to your request to become a Skype contact.
The Skype app can scan your Galaxy Tab’s address book (the Contacts list) 
for any potential Skype subscribers you may have missed. The operation can 
take some time — like over an hour — though it’s worthwhile. To find your 
friends on Skype, follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Contacts button on the Skype app’s main screen.
	
	
2.	Touch the bottom Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Search Address Book.
	
	 You most likely already have a gaggle of contacts in your Tab. The Skype 
app can scour your Contacts list and discover which ones are already 
on Skype.
	
4.	Touch the Continue button.
	
	 This operation can take some time. (I’m serious — more than an hour.) 
Be patient.
	
	 You can snooze the Tab while Skype is plowing through your Contacts 
list.
	
	 Eventually, you see a list of Skype contacts that the Skype app has found 
in your Contacts list.
	
5.	Touch the Continue button.
	
	The Skype app lists all contacts it could find who have Skype accounts.
	
6.	Remove the check marks by the contacts you don’t want to add.
	
	 If you add all the contacts (done in Step 7), a Skype request is sent to 
each one. If you don’t want to send a request to someone in the list, 
remove the check mark by that contact’s name.
	
	 Be sure to check the list! Skype searches for matching text, not for 
individuals, so random and unusual Skype contacts doubtlessly show 
up in the list, especially ones that list multiple Skype names; look for 
Customer Care and noreply, and be sure to remove them.

124
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
7.	Touch the Add button.
	
8.	Type an introductory message.
	
	 The contact has to approve you as a Skype buddy, so make the message 
sound important but not urgent, wanting but not desperate.
	
9.	Touch the Add Contacts button.
	
	 The contacts are added to the Contacts tab, but they sport a question 
mark status until they agree to accept your Skype invitation.
If scanning the Galaxy Tab’s Contacts list doesn’t do the job, you search for a 
specific contact:
	
1.	Touch the Contacts button on the Skype app’s main screen.
	
	
2.	Touch the bottom Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Add Contacts.
	
4.	Type the contact’s name or phone number.
	
	
5.	Touch the Search icon button to start the search.
	
6.	Scroll the list of results to find the exact person you’re looking for.
	
	 If your friend has a common name, the list will be quite extensive. You 
can use city information to help narrow the list, but not every Skype 
user specifies a current city. The Skype username may also help you 
identify specific people.
	
7.	Touch an entry to add it to your Contacts list.
	
	 You see a full-page description for the contact, where you can choose to 
call him, chat on Skype, or add him to your Contacts list.
	
8.	Touch the Add button.
No matter how you add people to your list, you see the question mark icon as 
a person’s status until he agrees to accept your request.
	
✓	You can always e-mail people you know and ask them whether they’re 
on Skype.
	
✓	Some people may not use Skype often, so it takes a while for them to 
respond to your friend request.
	
✓	If you accidentally add unusual or odd Skype contacts, my advice is to 
delete them. To remove a contact, long-press that contact’s name in the 
list and choose the command Remove Contact from the pop-up menu.

125
 Chapter 9: Phone Calls and Video Chat
	
✓	You can block a contact by long-pressing his entry and choosing the 
command Block Contact from the pop-up menu.
	
✓	If the Skype app crashes during a contact-searching operation, it’s prob­
ably because you’ve collected some bogus Skype contacts. It happens. 
A good way to get out of this situation is to use the Skype program on 
a computer to clean up and remove unwanted contacts. You may also 
need to uninstall and then reinstall the Skype app. See Chapter 16 for 
information on uninstalling apps.
Chatting with another Skype user
You can text chat with any Skype user, which works similarly to texting, 
though with no maximum-character limitations. The only restriction is that 
you can chat only with other Skype users.
To chat, choose a contact from the Contacts list. (Refer to Figure 9-4.) You 
see a screen with more detailed information about the contact. Choose the 
option Send IM, where the IM stands for instant message. Providing that your 
Skype friend is online and eager, you’ll be chatting in no time, as shown in 
Figure 9-5.
Type your text in the box, as illustrated in Figure 9-5. Touch the Send button 
to publish your comment. You can also use the Smiley button to insert a cute 
graphic into your text. The conversation unfolds similar to what’s shown in 
Figure 9-5.
	
	
✓	The Skype Chat notification, shown in the margin, appears whenever 
someone wants to chat with you. It’s handy to see, especially when you 
may have switched away from the Skype app to do something else on the 
Galaxy Tab. Simply touch that notification to get into the conversation.
	
✓	You can add more people to the conversation, if you like: Touch the 
bottom Menu icon button and choose the command Add. Select the con­
tacts you want to join with your chat session, and then touch the Add 
Selected button. It’s a gang chat!
	
	
✓	To stop chatting, touch the Back icon button. The conversation is kept 
in the Skype app, even after the other person has disconnected.
	
✓	For the chat to work, the other user must be online and available.

account, you can chat it up all you want, pretending all the while that the Tab 
is a phone. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Contacts icon on the Skype app’s main screen.
	
2.	Choose a contact.
	
	 Chatting works best when the contact is available: Look for a green 
check mark icon by her name.
	
3.	Choose Skype Call from the Actions tab on the contact’s information 
screen.
	
	 If prompted, choose the contact’s Skype account, not her phone 
number. (Calling a phone with Skype is covered in the next section.)
	
	 In a few Internet seconds, the other person picks up, and you’re speak­
ing with each other. You see the In-Call screen, lovingly illustrated in 
Figure 9-6.

If someone calls you on Skype, you see the Skype incoming call screen, simi­
lar to the one shown in Figure 9-7. Touch the Answer button to accept the 
call and start talking. Touch Decline to dismiss the call, especially when it’s 
someone who annoys you.

✓	Voice chat on Skype over the Internet is free. When you use a Wi-Fi con­
nection, you can chat without incurring a loss of your cellular plan’s 
data minutes.
	
✓	You can chat with any user in your Skype contacts list, by using a mobile 
device, a computer, or any other gizmo on which Skype is installed.
	
✓	To mute the microphone, touch the Mute Mic button, illustrated earlier, 
in Figure 9-6.
	
✓	If you plan to use Skype a lot, get a good headset.
	
✓	When a headset is plugged in, the self-speaker Mute button switches 
between headphones and the Tab’s built-in speakers.

129
 Chapter 9: Phone Calls and Video Chat
Seeing on Skype (video call)
Your Galaxy Tab may be blessed with the ability to make Skype video calls. 
(The Skype app may not allow video chat on all Tabs.) If so, you can see your 
Skype contact while you yack with him. Well, it works providing that the 
other person also is using Skype on a gizmo that features video chat.
A video call works similarly to a Skype Call, covered in the preceding section. 
But instead of choosing Skype Call in Step 3, you choose Skype Video Call. 
And in Step 4, in addition to “Talk,” you can make funny faces or show the 
other person around the room.
	
Use the Camera button (in the lower-right part of the screen) to turn the 
Galaxy Tab’s video camera on or off or to switch between front and rear 
cameras.
Making a Skype phone call
Voice chat is okay on Skype, and it comes a close second to the real thing: 
making a phone call. Yep, you can use Skype to call any phone number on the 
planet, but most easily you can call people’s phone numbers as listed in the 
Galaxy Tab’s Contacts list. Here’s what to do:
	
1.	Ensure that you have Skype Credit.
	
	 You can’t make a “real” phone call unless you have Skype Credit on your 
account. You add Skype Credit by touching the Profile button (refer to 
Figure 9-4) and choosing Skype Credit.
	
2.	From the Skype app’s main screen, touch the Call Phones button.
	
	 You see a big dial pad for typing phone numbers, just like you would if 
the Galaxy Tab were a huge cell phone.
	
3.	Type the phone number to dial.
	
	 Or, use the Contacts button in the upper-right corner of the screen to 
summon a contact. Choosing a contact places his number on the Call tab.
	
	 Always input the full phone number when making a Skype phone call, 
including the country code, shown as +1 for the United States, as well as 
the area code.
	
4.	Touch the Done button to dismiss the onscreen dial pad.
	
5.	Touch the Call button to place the call.

130
Part II: The Communications Tab 
	
	 This step works just like using a cell phone. Indeed, at this point, the 
Galaxy Tab has been transformed by the Skype app into a cell phone 
(albeit a cell phone that uses Internet telephony to make the call).
	
6.	Talk.
	
	 The In-Call screen looks nearly identical to Figure 9-6. The biggest dif­
ference is the per-minute price listed beneath the contact’s name in the 
upper-left corner of the screen.
	
7.	To end the call, touch the End Call button.
	
8.	If the number you dialed isn’t a current Skype contact, touch the Add 
Contact button to create a Skype contact for that person.
	
	 Skype contacts are separate from Galaxy Tab contacts. By touching the 
Add Contact button, you create a phone number contact for the number 
you just dialed.
Lamentably, you can’t receive a phone call using Skype on your Galaxy Tab 
from a cell phone or landline unless you pay for a Skype online number. In 
that case, you can use Skype to both send and receive regular phone calls. 
This book doesn’t cover the Online Number option.
	
✓	You can check the Skype website for a current list of call rates, for both 
domestic and international calls: www.skype.com.
	
✓	Unless you’ve paid Skype to have a specific phone number, the phone 
number shown on the recipient’s Caller ID screen is something unex­
pected, often merely the text Unknown. Because of that, you might want 
to e-mail or text the person you’re calling and let her know that you’re 
placing a Skype call. That way, she won’t skip the call because she 
doesn’t recognize the Caller ID number.
Sending a text message with Skype
One other cell phone–like thing you can do with Skype on your Galaxy Tab is 
to send a text message. If you have a teenager or are one, you recognize that 
text messaging is perhaps the only way young people use their cell phones. 
It’s rad. (Or some other word similar to rad but more in sync with the current 
generation.)
To send a text message using the Skype app on your Galaxy Tab, heed these 
directions:
	
1.	Ensure that you have some Skype credit.

131
 Chapter 9: Phone Calls and Video Chat
	
	 Text messages aren’t free, as any parent without an unlimited text mes­
saging cellular plan can attest. As this book goes to press, it costs 11.2 
cents to send a text message using Skype.
	
2.	Summon a contact from the list of Skype contacts.
	
	 Touch the Contacts icon on the main Skype screen and then choose a 
contact, hopefully one who also has his cell phone number listed.
	
3.	On the contact’s info screen, choose SMS.
	
	 You see a text message composition screen, which is far too spacious 
and boring to illustrate in this book. Do note, however, the per-message 
cost listed in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
4.	Touch the text box at the bottom of the screen.
	
	 The onscreen keyboard appears.
	
5.	Type your missive.
	
	 You have only 160 characters to make your point.
	
6.	Touch the Send button.
	
	 The text message is sent.
The cell phone you messaged receives the text just like any other text mes­
sage. The sender information, however, might be only a cryptic number. So 
do make sure that you identify yourself when sending the text message.
The recipient can reply to the message. The reply is received in the Skype 
app, and it’s tracked like a text conversation, similar to what’s shown in 
Figure 9-5. The message may not be received instantly, as it is on a cell 
phone. Eventually you’ll get the message. And you’ll be charged for it.
	
✓	To get Skype Credit, touch the Profile icon on the main Skype screen. 
Touch the Skype Credit item and follow the directions on screen to buy 
more credit.
	
✓	It’s possible to compose a text message from the Contacts app: When a 
contact’s information is displayed, touch his phone number. Providing 
that the Skype app is running and you’re signed in, you’re whisked off to 
the text message composition screen, described earlier in this section.
	
✓	Text messages are also known by the scary and bewildering acronym 
SMS. I believe that means Short Message Service. Most people just say 
“text message.”

y favorite scenes from the original Star 
Trek TV show were when Mr. Spock would 
whip out his tricorder. It was a gizmo that could 
do everything. It recorded, analyzed, plus it could 
tap into the computer to recall information. I’m 
sure it could play music and remind Mr. Spock of 
upcoming appointments as well, but those scenes 
were never shown on TV.
Boy! Would Mr. Spock be jealous of the Galaxy 
Tab. It does just about everything that his old tri­
corder did — and more. Plus it does all those 
things without making a distracting whistling 
noise. If you’d like to do those things, too, just 
read this part of the book, which covers those 
wonderful, unusual, and potentially great things 
the Galaxy Tab can do.

tupid kidnappers. They frisked me for a phone but left the Galaxy Tab. I 
suppose they thought it might be a picture frame. Or perhaps they 
didn’t even look inside the leatherette case, figuring it was portfo­
lio. That was a mistake.
Even from inside the trunk, I could use the Tab. The signal 
was clear. The Maps app told me that I was in Seattle.
Seattle! Had they driven that far? It wasn’t that 
important: Using the Tab, I knew not only where I 
was, but where a fancy Hungarian restaurant was 
nearby. I could send an e-mail with my location to 
the authorities and then be chowing down on a hot 
bowl of goulash in no time. Thank heavens for the 
Maps app!
There’s a Map for That
Your location, as well as the location of things near and far, is found 
on the Galaxy Tab by using the Maps app. Good news: You run no risk of 
improperly folding the Maps app. Better news: The Maps app charts the 
entire country, including freeways, highways, roads, streets, avenues, drives, 
bike paths, addresses, businesses, and points of interest.

136
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Using the Maps app
You start the Maps app by choosing Maps from the Apps Menu. If you’re 
starting the app for the first time or it has been recently updated, you can 
read its What’s New screen; touch the OK button to continue.
The Galaxy Tab communicates with global positioning system (GPS) satel­
lites to hone in on your current location. (See the later sidebar, “Activate 
your locations!”) It’s shown on the map, similar to Figure 10-1. The position is 
accurate to within a given range, as shown by a blue circle around your loca­
tion on the map.

Figure 10-1: Your location on a map.
Here are some fun things you can do when viewing the basic street map:
Zoom in: To make the map larger (to move it closer), double-tap the screen 
or spread your fingers on the touchscreen.
Zoom out: To make the map smaller (to see more), pinch your fingers on the 
touchscreen.

137
 Chapter 10: Getting from Here to There
Pan and scroll: To see what’s to the left or right or at the top or bottom of 
the map, drag your finger on the touchscreen; the map scrolls in the direc­
tion you drag your finger.
Rotate: Using two fingers, rotate the map clockwise or counterclockwise. 
Touch the Compass Pointer (shown in Figure 10-1) to reorient the map with 
north at the top of the screen.
	
	 Perspective: Tap the Location button to switch to Perspective view, where 
the map is shown at an angle. Touch the Location button again (though now 
it’s really the Perspective button) to return to flat-map view or, if that doesn’t 
work, touch the Compass Pointer.
The closer you zoom in to the map, the more detail you see, such as street 
names, address block numbers, and businesses and other sites — but no tiny 
people.
	
✓	The blue triangle (refer to Figure 10-1) shows in which general direction 
the Tab is pointing.
	
✓	When the Tab’s direction is unavailable, you see a blue dot as your loca­
tion on the map.
	
	
✓	When all you want is a virtual compass, similar to the one you lost as a 
kid, you can get the Compass app from the Android Market. See Chapter 
16 for more information about the Android Market.
	
✓	You can enter Perspective view for only your current location.
Activate your locations!
The Maps app works best when you activate 
all the Galaxy Tab location technology. I recom­
mend that you turn on three location settings. 
From the Apps Menu, open the Settings icon. 
Choose Location & Security. In the Location 
and Security settings, ensure that green check 
marks appear by these two items:
Use Wireless Networks: Allows the Tab to use 
signals from the Verizon cell towers to triangu­
late your position and refine the data received 
from GPS satellites.
Use GPS Satellites: Allows your Tab to access 
the GPS (global positioning system) satellites, 
but it’s not that accurate. That’s why you need 
to activate more than this service to fully use 
your Tab’s location abilities.
Further, you can activate the Tab’s Wi-Fi radio 
for even more exact location information. See 
Chapter 17 for information on turning on the 
Galaxy Tab Wi-Fi setting.

138
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Adding layers
You add details from the Maps app by applying layers: A layer can enhance 
the map’s visual appearance, provide more information, or add other fun fea­
tures to the basic street map, such as Satellite view, shown in Figure 10-2.

The key to accessing layers is to touch the Layers button, illustrated in 
Figure 10-2. Choose an option from the Layers menu to add that information 
to the Map app’s display.
You can add another layer by choosing it from the Layers menu, but keep in 
mind that some layers obscure others. For example, the Terrain layer over­
lays the Satellite layer so that you see only the Terrain layer.
To remove a layer, choose it from the Layers menu; any active layer appears 
with a green check mark to its right. To return to Street view, remove all 
layers.
	
✓	Most of the features found on the Layers menu originated in the Google 
Labs. To see new features that may be added to the Maps app, visit the 
Labs by touching the Menu icon button in the Maps app. Choose Labs to 
pore over potential new features.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab warns you whenever various applications access the 
Tab’s Location feature. The warning is nothing serious — the Tab is just 
letting you know that an app is accessing the device’s physical location. 

139
 Chapter 10: Getting from Here to There
Some folks may view this action as an invasion of privacy; hence the 
warnings. I see no issue with letting the Tab know where you are, but I 
understand that not everyone feels that way. If you’d rather not share 
location information, simply decline access when prompted.
It Knows Where You Are
You can look at a physical map all day long, and unless you have a sextant 
or a GPS, how would you know where you are? Never fear! The Galaxy Tab 
knows where you are. Not only does it have a GPS, but by using the Maps 
app, you can also instantly find out where you are and what’s nearby and 
even send your location to someone else.
Finding out where you are
The Maps app shows your location as a compass arrow or blue dot on the 
screen. But where is that? I mean, if you need to phone a tow truck, you can’t 
just say, “I’m the blue triangle on the orange slab by the green thing.”
Well, you can say that, but it probably won’t do any good.
To find your current street address, or any street address, long-press a 
location on the Maps screen. Up pops a bubble, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 10-3, that gives your approximate address.

If you touch the address bubble, you see a pop-up window full of interesting 
things you can do, also shown in Figure 10-3.
	
✓	When you’re searching for a location, distance and general direction are 
shown in the pop-up window. Otherwise, as shown in Figure 10-3, the 
distance and direction information isn’t necessary.
	
✓	The What’s Nearby command displays a list of nearby businesses or 
points of interest, some of them shown on the screen and others avail­
able if you touch the What’s Nearby command.
	
✓	Choose the Search Nearby item to use the Search command to locate 
businesses, people, or points of interest near the given location.
	
✓	What’s really fun to play with is the Street View command. Choosing this 
option displays the location from a 360-degree perspective. In Street 
view, you can browse a locale, pan and tilt, or zoom in on details to 
familiarize yourself with an area, for example — whether you’re familiar­
izing yourself with a location or planning a burglary.
Helping others find your location
	
It’s possible to use the Maps app to send your current location to a friend. 
If your pal has a mobile device (phone or tablet) with smarts similar to the 
Galaxy Tab, he can use the coordinates to get directions to your location. 
Maybe he’ll even bring some goulash!
To send your current location in an e-mail message, obey these steps:
	
1.	Long-press your current location on the Map.
	
	 You see a pop-up bubble.
	
2.	Touch the pop-up bubble.
	
3.	Choose the command Share This Place from the pop-up window.
	
	 The pop-up window is shown in Figure 10-3.
	
4.	Choose either the Gmail or Email item from the Share This Place 
menu.
	
	 The Gmail or Email app starts, with a preset subject and message. The 
subject is your street address or the address of the bubble you touched 
in Step 2. The message content is the address again, but it’s also a link to 
the current location.
	
5.	Type one or more recipients into the To field.
	
6.	Touch the Send button to whisk off the message.

141
 Chapter 10: Getting from Here to There
When the recipient receives the e-mail, she can touch the link to open your 
location in the Maps app — providing that she has a Galaxy Tab or some 
other mobile Android device. When the location appears, she can follow my 
advice in the later section, “Getting directions,” for getting to your location. 
And don’t loan her this book either; have her buy her own copy. And bring 
goulash. Thanks.
Find Things
The Maps app can help you find places in the real world, just like the 
Browser app helps you find places on the Internet. Both operations work 
basically the same:
Open the Maps app and type something to find into the Search Maps text 
box, as illustrated in Figure 10-1. You can type a variety of terms into the 
Search box, as explained in this section.
Looking for a specific address
To locate an address, type it into the Search box; for example:
1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, D.C. 20006
Touch the Search button on the keyboard, and that location is then shown on 
the map. The next step is getting directions, which you can read about in the 
later section, “Getting directions.”
	
✓	You don’t need to type the entire address. Oftentimes, all you need is 
the street number and street name and then either the city name or zip 
code.
	
✓	If you omit the city name or zip code, the Galaxy Tab looks for the clos­
est matching address near your current location.
Finding a business, restaurant, or point of interest
You may not know an address, but you know when you crave sushi or 
Hungarian or perhaps the exotic flavors of Freedonia. Maybe you need a 
hotel or a gas station, or you have to find a place that buys old dentures. To 
find a business entity or a point of interest, type its name in the Search box; 
for example:
Movie theater

142
Part III: The Everything Tab 
This command flags movie theaters on the current Maps screen or nearby.
Specify your current location, as described earlier in this chapter, to find 
locations near you. Otherwise, the Maps app looks for places near the area 
you see on the screen.
Or, you can be specific and look for businesses near a certain location by 
specifying the city name, district, or zip code, such as
Hungarian 98001
After typing this command and touching the Search button, you see a smat­
tering of Hungarian restaurants found near Seattle, similar to the ones shown 
in Figure 10-4.

To see more information about a result, touch its cartoon bubble, such as the 
one for the Danube Bistro in Figure 10-4. The screen that appears offers more 
information, plus perhaps even a web address and Tab number.
	
	 You can touch the Get Directions button on the restaurant’s (or any location’s) 
details screen to get directions; see the later section, “Getting directions.”

✓	Every letter or dot on the screen represents a search result. (Refer to 
Figure 10-4.)
	
✓	Spread your fingers on the touchscreen to zoom in to the map.
	
✓	You can create a contact for the location, keeping it as a part of your 
Contacts list: After touching the location balloon, touch the More button 
and choose the command Add As a Contact. The contact is created 
using data known about the business, including its location and Tab 
number and even a web page address — if that information is available.
Searching for interesting places
Maybe you don’t know what you’re looking for. Maybe you’re like my teenage 
sons, who stand in front of the open refrigerator, waiting for the sandwich 
fairy to hand them a snack. The Maps app features a sort of I-don’t-know-
what-I-want-but-I-want-something fairy. It’s the Places command.
Touch the Places button (refer to Figure 10-1) to see the Places pop-up 
window. It shows categories of places near you: restaurants, coffee shops, 
bars, hotels, attractions, and more. Touch an item to see matching locations 
in your vicinity.
You can also use the Places app to summon the Places pop-up window in the 
Maps app. You can find the Places app on the Apps Menu.
Locating a contact
You can hone in on where your contacts are located by using the Maps app. 
This trick works when you’ve specified an address for the contact — home, 
work, prison, or another location. If so, the Galaxy Tab can easily help you 
find that location or even give you directions.
	
	 The secret to finding a contact’s location is the little Place icon by the con­
tact’s address, shown in the margin. Anytime you see this icon, you can 
touch it to view that location by using the Maps app.
The Galaxy Tab Is Your Copilot
Finding something is only half the job. The other half is getting there. The 
Galaxy Tab is ever-ready, thanks to the various direction and navigation fea­
tures nestled in the Maps app.

144
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
I don’t believe that the Galaxy Tab has a car mount, not like a cell phone 
does. Therefore, I strongly recommend that if you use your Tab in your auto, 
have someone else hold it and read the directions. Or use voice navigation 
and, for goodness sake, don’t look at the Tab while you’re driving!
Getting directions
One command associated with locations on the map is Get Directions. Here’s 
how to use it:
	
1.	Touch a location’s cartoon bubble displayed by an address, a contact, 
or a business or from the result of a map search.
	
	 A pop-up window appears, offering more information, similar to what’s 
shown in Figure 10-3.
	
2.	Touch the Directions button.
	
	 A menu appears, offering three choices. 
	
	
3.	Choose Get Directions from the Please Select menu.
	
	 A list of directions appears on the left side of the screen, similar to 
what’s shown in Figure 10-5. The list starts with your location and ends 
at the location you selected. A blue line on the map on the other side of 
the screen shows your route.
	
4.	Follow the blue line.
If you can’t constantly look at the Tab to see the map, touch the Navigation 
button, shown in Figure 10-5. Also see the next section for more details on 
navigation using the Maps app.
	
✓	The Maps app alerts you to any toll roads on the specified route. As you 
travel, you can choose alternative, non-toll routes if available. You’re 
prompted to switch routes during navigation; see the next section.
	
✓	You may not get perfect directions from the Maps app, but for places 
you’ve never visited, it’s a useful tool.
Navigating to your destination
Maps and lists of directions are so 20th century. I don’t know why anyone 
would bother, especially when the Galaxy Tab features a digital copilot in the 
form of voice navigation.

Figure 10-5: Going from here to there.
To use navigation, choose the Navigation option from any list of directions. 
Or, touch the Navigation button, as shown earlier, in Figure 10-5. You can 
also enter the Navigation app directly by choosing it from the Apps Menu, 
though then you must type (or speak) your destination, so it’s just easier to 
start in the Maps app.
In Navigation mode, the Galaxy Tab displays an interactive map that shows 
your current location and turn-by-turn directions for reaching your destina­
tion. A digital voice tells you how far to go and when to turn, for example, 
and gives you other nagging advice — just like a backseat driver, albeit an 
accurate one.
After choosing Navigation, sit back and have the Tab dictate your directions. 
You can simply listen, or just glance at the Tab for an update of where you’re 
heading.
	
	 To stop navigation, touch the Menu icon button and choose the Exit 
Navigation command.

146
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
✓	To remove the navigation route from the screen, exit Navigation mode 
and return to the Maps app. Touch the Menu icon button and choose 
the Clear Map command.
	
✓	When you tire of hearing the navigation voice, touch the Menu icon 
button and choose the Mute command.
	
✓	I refer to the navigation voice as Gertrude.
	
✓	You can touch the Menu icon button while navigating and choose Route 
Info to see an overview of your journey.
	
✓	When viewing the Route Info screen, touch the Gear button to see a 
handy pop-up menu. From this menu, you can choose options to modify 
the route so that you avoid highways or toll roads, for example.
	
✓	The neat thing about the Navigation feature is that whenever you screw 
up, a new course is immediately calculated.
	
✓	In Navigation mode, the Galaxy Tab consumes a lot of battery power. I 
highly recommend that you plug the Tab into your car’s power adapter 
(“cigarette lighter”) for the duration of the trip.
Adding a navigation shortcut to the Home screen
When you visit certain places often — such as the liquor store — you can 
save yourself the time you would spend repeatedly inputting navigation 
information: All you need to do is create a navigation shortcut on the Home 
screen. Here’s how:
	
1.	Touch the Add button in the upper-right corner of the Home screen.
	
	 You see the Home screen overview, which shows all five Home screen 
panels plus categories listing items you can add to the Home screen.
	
2.	Choose the More category.
	
3.	Choose Directions & Navigation.
	
4.	Type a destination, a contact name, an address, or a business in the 
text box.
	
	 As you type, suggestions appear in a list. You can choose a suggestion 
to save yourself some typing.
	
5.	Choose a traveling method.
	
	 Your options are car, public transportation, bicycle, and on foot.
	
6.	Scroll down a bit to type a shortcut name.

147
 Chapter 10: Getting from Here to There
	
7.	Choose an icon for the shortcut.
	
	 You may have to touch the Back icon button to dismiss the onscreen 
keyboard and see the shortcut icons.
	
8.	Touch the Save button.
	
	 The navigation shortcut is placed on the Home screen.
	
9.	Touch the Home icon button to return to the Home screen.
To use the shortcut, simply touch it on the Home screen. Instantly, the Maps 
app starts and enters Navigation mode, steering you from wherever you are 
to the location referenced by the shortcut.
See Chapter 20 for additional information on creating Home screen shortcuts.
Where Are Your Friends?
A feature in the Maps app is Latitude. It’s a layer you can apply to a map, but 
it’s also the name of its own app, Latitude.
Latitude is a social networking service that lets you share your physical loca­
tion with your friends, also assumed to be using Latitude. Being able to more 
easily know where your friends are makes it possible to meet up with them — 
or, I suppose, to avoid them. It’s all up to you.
To join Latitude, you touch the Menu icon button when viewing a map and then 
choose the Join Latitude command. Or, you can just start the Latitude app.
After opening Latitude, read the information and then touch the Allow & 
Share button to continue. If you don’t see the Join Latitude command, you’ve 
already joined; start Latitude by choosing the Latitude command.
To make Latitude work, you need to add friends to Latitude, and those 
friends need to use Latitude. After adding Latitude friends, you can share 
your location with them as well as view their locations on a map. You can 
also chat with Google Talk, send them e-mail, get directions to their location, 
and do other interesting things.
To exit Latitude, touch the Menu icon button when Latitude is active and 
choose Settings. Choose the Sign Out of Latitude command from the Settings 
pop-up window.

ameras have come a long way since Nicéphore Niépce took a day-long 
exposure of his backyard using a camera obscura. Photography was 
an analog, real-world thing until the 1990s. Then technology went 
digital, and in a few decades, it will be old people who refer 
to a “roll” of film.
What’s also changed is the camera. No more do you 
hold the thing up to your face. Instead, you hold the 
device at arm’s length and peer at a teensy monitor. 
What’s even more strange is holding up a large, flat 
object such as the Galaxy Tab and using it to take a 
picture. Sure, it works. It’s handy. But it’s just very 
unusual and different enough that I present to you 
an entire chapter on using your Tab as a camera.
The Galaxy Tab Camera
I admit that the Galaxy Tab isn’t the world’s best camera. And 
I’m sure that Mr. Spock’s tricorder wasn’t the best camera in the Star 
Trek universe, either, but it could take pictures. That comparison is kind 

150
Part III: The Everything Tab 
of the whole point: Your Galaxy Tab is an incredible gizmo that does many 
things. One of those things is to take pictures, as described in this section.
Snapping a pic
Picture-taking duties on your Galaxy Tab are handled by the Camera app. It 
controls both the main camera, which is on the Tab’s butt, and the front-fac­
ing camera, which is not on the Tab’s butt. Like all apps on the Tab, you can 
find and start the Camera app by touching its icon on the Apps Menu screen.
After starting the Camera app, you see the main Camera screen, as illustrated 
in Figure 11-1.

Figure 11-1: Your Tab as a camera.
To take a picture, first ensure that the Camera app is in still picture mode: 
Check the switch on the upper-right part of the screen to confirm that it’s 
in the Camera position. Then point the camera at the subject and touch the 
Shutter button, shown in Figure 11-1.

151
 Chapter 11: It’s a Big, Flat Camera
After you touch the Shutter button, the camera will focus, you may hear a 
mechanical shutter sound play, and the flash may go off. You’re ready to take 
the next picture.
To preview the image you just snapped, touch the little icon that appears in 
the lower-right corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 11-1.
	
✓	The Wi-Fi Tab features an extra button on the bottom left. (Refer to 
Figure 11-1.) It’s the Back button, which is used to exit the Camera app.
	
✓	The camera focuses automatically, though you can drag the focus 
square around the touchscreen to specifically adjust the focus. (Refer to 
Figure 11-1.)
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab camera has a fixed focal-length lens, so there is no zoom 
feature.
	
✓	The Tab can be used as a camera in either landscape or portrait orienta­
tion, though the Tab’s controls and gizmos are always presented in land­
scape format. (Refer to Figure 11-1.) The icons rotate when you reorient 
the Tab.
	
✓	You can take as many pictures with your Galaxy Tab as you like, as long 
as you don’t run out of space for them in the Tab’s internal storage.
	
✓	If your pictures appear blurry, ensure that the camera lens on the back 
of the Galaxy Tab isn’t dirty.
	
✓	Use the Gallery app to preview and manage your pictures. See Chapter 12 
for more information about the Gallery.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab not only takes a picture but also keeps track of where 
you were located on Planet Earth when you took it. See the section 
“Setting the image’s location,” later in this chapter, for details. Also refer 
to Chapter 12 for information on reviewing a photograph’s location.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab stores pictures in the JPEG image file format. Images are 
stored in the DCIM/Camera folder; they have the jpg filename exten­
sion. By default, images are stored on the MicroSD card. You can change 
the storage location by pulling out the Control Drawer and choosing the 
Settings icon. (Refer to Figure 11-1.) Choose Storage Location and select 
either Internal Phone Storage or SD Card.
Deleting an image immediately after you take it
Sometimes, you just can’t wait to delete an image. Either an irritated person 
is standing next to you, begging that the photo be deleted, or you’re just not 

152
Part III: The Everything Tab 
happy and you feel the urge to smash into digital shards the picture you just 
took. Hastily follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch the image preview that appears in the lower-right corner of the 
screen. (Refer to Figure 11-1.)
	
	 After touching the preview, you see the full-screen image.
	
2.	Touch the Trash icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
3.	Choose Confirm Delete to erase the image.
	
	 The image has been banished to bit hell.
	
	 If necessary, touch the Back icon button to return to the Camera app.
Setting the flash
The camera on the Galaxy Tab has three flash settings, as shown in Table 11-1.
Table 11-1	
Galaxy Tab Camera Flash Settings

Description
Auto
The flash activates during low-light situations but not 
when it’s bright out.

The flash always activates.
Off
The flash never activates, even in low-light situations.
To change or check the flash setting, look at the Flash button on the left side 
of the screen, shown earlier, in Figure 11-1. The button’s icon confirms the 
current flash setting, which is Off in the figure. Choose the Flash setting from 
the pop-up menu that appears.
	
A good time to turn on the flash is when taking pictures of people or objects 
in front of something bright, such as a cute, fuzzy kitten playing with a ball of 
white yarn in front of an exploding gasoline truck.

153
 Chapter 11: It’s a Big, Flat Camera
Changing the resolution
Proving once again that the Galaxy Tab isn’t really a digital camera (it only 
has a digital camera), there are only two resolution settings for the main 
camera: pitiful and pathetic.
Well, the settings aren’t called pitiful or pathetic, but compared with the high 
resolutions of mainstream consumer digital cameras, the resolutions aren’t 
going to wow them at the county fair.
To set the resolution in the Camera app, touch the Settings button on the 
left side of the Camera app’s main screen. (Refer to Figure 11-1.) Choose 
the Resolution command and then select between 2048X1536 (pitiful) and 
1024X768 (pathetic).
Touch the Back icon button to dismiss the Settings menu.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab’s front-facing camera has a fixed resolution of 1,600 by 
1,200 pixels.
	
✓	A picture’s resolution describes how many pixels, or dots, are in the 
image. The more dots, the better the image looks and prints.
	
✓	The 2048X1536 resolution is 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, which works out to a 
3.2 megapixel image. That’s very low, seeing how most digital cameras — 
even on cell phones — are in the 8 megapixel range.
	
✓	Megapixel is a measurement of the amount of information stored in an 
image. One megapixel is approximately 1 million pixels, or individual 
dots that compose an image. It’s often abbreviated MP.
	
✓	Even though the camera resolution is low, the quality is just super for 
taking pictures you plan on uploading to Facebook or sharing via e-mail.
	
✓	See the later section, “Setting video quality,” for information on the 
Video Resolution setting, which applies only to shooting video with the 
Galaxy Tab.
Doing a self-portrait
Who needs to pay all that money for a mirror when you have the Galaxy Tab? 
Well, forget the mirror. Instead, think about taking all those self-shots without 
having to second-guess whether the camera is pointed at your face.
To take your own mug shot, start the Camera app and touch the Switch 
Camera button, shown earlier, in Figure 11-1. When you see yourself on the 
screen, you’re doing it properly.
Smile. Click. You got it.

154
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Touch the Switch Camera button again to direct the Galaxy Tab to use the 
main camera again.
Taking a panoramic shot
No, it’s not an exotic new alcoholic drink: A panorama is a wide shot, like a 
landscape, a beautiful vista, or a family photograph after a garlic feast. One 
Galaxy Tab camera mode allows you to crunch several images into a pan­
oramic shot. Obey these steps:
	
1.	Start the Camera app.
	
2.	Touch the Shooting mode button.
	
	 Refer to Figure 11-1. The button’s icon changes, depending on which 
mode you’re using.
	
3.	Choose Panorama.
	
4.	Hold your arms steady.
	
5.	Touch the Shutter button.
	
	 You see a green frame on the screen, which approximates the current 
shot. Arrows point in the eight directions in which you can pan.
	
6.	Pivot slightly to your right (or in whatever direction, but you must 
continue in the same direction).
	
	 As you move the camera, the green frame adjusts to your new position. 
The Galaxy Tab beeps as the next image in the panorama is snapped 
automatically. All you need to do is keep moving.
	
7.	Continue pivoting as subsequent shots are taken, or touch the Shutter 
button again to finish the panorama.
	
	After the last image is snapped, wait while the image is assembled.
The Camera app sticks the different shots together, creating a panoramic 
image.
	
✓	To exit Panoramic mode, repeat Steps 1 and 2, but in Step 3 choose 
Single Shot.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab camera automatically captures the panoramic shot. You 
touch the Shutter button only when you’re done.

155
 Chapter 11: It’s a Big, Flat Camera
Setting the image’s location
The Galaxy Tab not only takes a picture, but also keeps track of where you’re 
located on Planet Earth when you take the picture — if you’ve turned on that 
option. The feature is called Geo-Tab or GPS-Tag, and here’s how to ensure 
that it’s on:
	
1.	While using the Camera app, touch the Settings button.
	
2.	Choose GPS Tag.
	
3.	If the On setting isn’t chosen, touch it to activate GPS Tag.
	
4.	Touch the Back icon button to close the Settings menu.
Not everyone is comfortable with having the Tab record a picture’s location, 
so you can turn the option off. Just repeat these steps, but choose Off in 
Step 3.
See Chapter 12 for information on reviewing a photograph’s location.
Adjusting the camera
The Camera app sports various adjustments you can make, two of which 
are fun to play with: Scene Mode and Effects. Both options are found on the 
Settings menu, which is displayed when you touch the Settings button on the 
left side of the screen. (Refer to Figure 11-1.)
Scene Mode: Choosing this item lets you configure the camera for taking 
certain types of pictures. Choose an option that describes the type of images 
you’re capturing, such as Sports for quick-action, Night for low-light situa­
tions, or Text for copying documents. The None setting directs the camera to 
choose the best scene by guessing.
Effects: Add special visual effects by touching the Effects option. There are 
only four: None for no effects; Grayscale to shoot in monochrome; Sepia for 
that old-time look; and Negative, which is how people who watch too much 
politics on television see the world.
Live from Your Galaxy Tab, It’s Video!
When the action is hot — when you need to capture more than a moment 
(and maybe the sounds) — you switch the Galaxy Tab camera into Video 
mode. Doing so may not turn you into the next David Fincher, because I hear 
he uses an iPhone to make his films.

156
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Recording video
Video chores on the Galaxy Tab are handled by the same Camera app that 
takes still images, as discussed earlier in this chapter. The secret is to switch 
the Camera app into Video mode. You do that by flipping the switch illus­
trated in both Figures 11-1 and 11-2.

time indicator appears in the upper-right corner of the screen, telling you the 
video shot duration.
To stop recording, touch the Stop button.
	
✓	Hold the Tab steady! The camera still works when you whip the Tab 
around, but wild gyrations render the video unwatchable.
	
✓	The Camera app restarts itself in video mode if that was the active mode 
when you last quit.

157
 Chapter 11: It’s a Big, Flat Camera
	
✓	The video’s duration depends on its resolution (see the next section) 
as well as on the storage available on your Tab. The maximum record­
ing time is shown on the screen before you shoot. (Refer to Figure 11-2.) 
While you record, elapsed time appears.
	
✓	As with the single-shot version of the Camera app, there are no zoom 
controls for shooting video.
	
✓	Visual effects (the cheap kind, not the Hollywood CGI kind) can be 
applied to the video. Touch the Settings button and choose Effects.
	
✓	Chapter 12 covers the Gallery app, used to view and manage videos 
stored on your Tab. Directions are also found in Chapter 15 for upload­
ing your video to YouTube as well as editing video with the Movie Studio 
app.
	
✓	Recorded video is saved in the Tab’s internal storage.
	
✓	The video is stored on the Galaxy Tab using the MPEG-4 video file 
format. The video files are located in the DCIM/Camera folder and have 
the mp4 filename extension.
Setting video quality
You might guess that setting the highest video quality would always be best. 
Not so! For example, video you shoot for YouTube need not be of top qual­
ity. Multimedia text messaging (known as MMS) video should be of very low 
quality or else the video doesn’t attach to the message. Also, high resolution 
video uses up a heck of a lot more storage space on the Galaxy Tab.
To set the video quality while using the Camcorder app, touch the Settings 
icon. (Refer to Figure 11-2.) Choose the Resolution command. There are two 
settings:
1080X720: The highest-quality setting is best suited for video you plan 
to show on a large-format TV or computer monitor. It’s useful for video 
editing or for showing important events, such as Bigfoot sightings.
640X480: This setting is good for Internet video or e-mail attachments, 
though it doesn’t enlarge well.
The front-facing camera has no video quality setting; the quality is fixed at 
640X480, the same as the lowest setting for the main camera.
	
Check the video quality before you shoot! Especially if you know where the 
video will end up (on the Internet, on a TV, or in an MMS message), it helps 
to set the quality first.

158
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Shedding some light on your subject
You don’t need a flash when recording video, but occasionally you need a 
little more light. You can manually turn on the Galaxy Tab’s LED flash to help: 
On the left side of the Camera app screen, touch the Light button. Choose On 
to turn on the LED light, and choose Off to disable it.
The light comes on only when you start recording your video.
There is no light for shooting video with the front-facing camera.
	
Turning on the LED light consumes a hefty portion of battery power. Use it 
sparingly.
Shooting yourself
Put away your crossbow, blow gun, and rubber bands. When I refer to “shoot­
ing yourself,” I’m writing about the Galaxy Tab’s ability to let you record your 
own image — your face — by using the front-facing video camera. It’s cinchy.
The secret to shooting yourself is to touch the Switch Camera button, shown 
earlier in Figure 11-2. As soon as you see your punum on the touchscreen, 
you’ve done things properly.
The front-facing camera uses only 640 by 480 resolution (refer to the preced­
ing section), though it’s ideal for attaching to an e-mail or text message.
Also see Chapter 9 for information on video chat, which is a live version of 
shooting yourself.
Uploading and sharing video
Throughout various Galaxy Tab apps, you can find Upload commands and 
Share icon buttons. You can use those buttons to instantly capture a video 
and send it off to the Internet. For example, you can use the Facebook app 
to capture and upload a video faster than you can say, “Whoa! That was 
embarrassing.”
The secret is to find the Upload or Share command. When you do, choose the 
option to Capture Video. After that, you see the Camera app in Video mode, 
where you can quickly capture a few seconds of real life. After you’re done 
recording, you return to the other app, where you can add a title, comments, 
or do other mischief with your video.

159
 Chapter 11: It’s a Big, Flat Camera
	
✓	You can attach video to a Gmail or Email message, but you must first 
record the video. Recorded video is saved on the Tab, and you access 
it through the Gallery app. In Gmail or Email, touch the Attach button 
and choose the Gallery as the source. Find your video to attach and then 
send the message.
	
✓	Refer to Chapter 6 for information on sending e-mail.
	
✓	Keep the video message short! Short is good for a video message attach­
ment or an online post.

here’s no point in the Galaxy Tab having a camera unless 
it has a place to store pictures. My inner nerd reminds 
me that the Tab’s internal storage is the place where 
images and videos dwell, swaddled in a binary blanket 
called digital film. That’s all safe and good, but how 
can you get to those pictures and videos? More 
importantly, how can you view them, share them 
with your friends, or send them off to the informa­
tion superhighway?
The answer lies in an electronic Louvre of sorts. It’s 
the Gallery app, which you can use to view, manage, 
and manipulate the images you take using the Galaxy 
Tab’s cameras. Further, you can import other images 
into the Tab, including photos stored on your computer 
or found on the Internet. All that stuff is covered in this 
chapter.

Part III: The Everything Tab 
Where Your Pictures Lurk
Some people hang their pictures on the wall. Some put pictures on a piano 
or maybe on a mantle. In the digital realm, pictures are stored electronically, 
compressed and squeezed into a series of ones and zeroes that mean nothing 
unless you have an app that lets you view those images. On the Galaxy Tab, 
that app is the Gallery.
Visiting the Gallery
Start the Gallery app by choosing its icon from the Apps Menu, or you might 
find a Gallery app shortcut icon on the Home screen.
When the Gallery app opens, you see your visual media (pictures and videos) 
organized into piles, or albums, as shown in Figure 12-1. The number and 
variety of albums depend on how you synchronize your Tab with your com­
puter, which apps you use for collecting media, or which photo-sharing 
services you use on the Internet, such as Picasa.

 Chapter 12: Galaxy Gallery
	
✓	The Camera album contains video you’ve shot using the Tab.
	
✓	The Download album contains images downloaded from the Internet.
	
✓	Albums labeled with the Picasa icon have been synchronized between 
Picasa Web on the Internet and your Galaxy Tab. See the section 
“Accessing your Picasa account,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	Other albums in the Gallery represent images synchronized between the 
Galaxy Tab and your computer. See Chapter 18 for information on shar­
ing images between the Tab and your computer.
	
✓	Various apps may also create their own albums in the Gallery app.
	
✓	The View menu allows you to control how the images and videos are 
displayed in the gallery. Figure 12-1 shows the gallery organized by 
album view.
	
✓	You can use the Content menu (refer to Figure 12-1) to see pictures, 
videos, or both displayed in the gallery.
Looking at an album
Touching an album in the Gallery app displays that album’s contents, pic­
tures and videos, in a grid of thumbnail previews. Those previews give you 
an idea of what the images are, similar to what’s shown in Figure 12-2.

When a picture preview features a tiny Play button (refer to Figure 12-2), then 
it’s a video. Otherwise, the thumbnails represent still images.
You can view more images in the album by swiping your finger left and right.
To view all the images in an album, touch the Slideshow button, illustrated in 
Figure 12-2. Playing a slide show turns the Galaxy Tab into a fancy, animated 
picture frame.
Viewing a picture or video
To view an image or a video, open an album and then touch a thumbnail with 
your finger.
Images appear full size on the screen, similar to what’s shown in Figure 12-3. 
You can rotate the Tab horizontally (or vertically) to see the image in 
another orientation. Later sections describe in more detail what you can 
do when viewing an image.

Content menu, as shown in Figure 12-1.
	
✓	Touch a video or an image to redisplay the onscreen controls, as shown 
in Figures 12-3 and 12-4.
	
✓	To run a slide show of photos in an album, touch the Slideshow button, 
shown in Figure 12-3. The slide show starts, displaying one image after 
another. For videos, only a freeze frame from the video appears. To stop 
the slide show, touch the screen.
Finding out where you took a picture
When you snap a picture, the Galaxy Tab can save your location. This 
information is obtained from the Tab’s GPS, the same tool used to find your 

166
Part III: The Everything Tab 
location on a map. In fact, you can use the GPS information saved with a pic­
ture to see exactly where the picture was taken.
To see where you’ve taken a picture, follow these steps in the Gallery app:
	
1.	View the image.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose the command Show On Map.
	
	 The Maps app starts, showing the approximate location where the pic­
ture was taken, as shown in Figure 12-5.
Image viewed in the Gallery app.
Image location on the map.
Figure 12-5: Finding where an image was taken.

167
 Chapter 12: Galaxy Gallery
Not every image has location information. In some cases, the Galaxy Tab 
cannot read the GPS to store the information. When this happens, location 
information is unavailable and the Show On Map command doesn’t show up 
on the menu.
	
✓	Videos also store location information on the Galaxy Tab, though there 
doesn’t appear to be any way to access that information by using the 
Gallery app.
	
✓	The Tab’s GPS can be disabled for images you capture. Refer to Chapter 11 
for information on how to turn GPS on or off when taking pictures.
Assigning an image to a contact
You can set any image for a contact. It doesn’t necessarily have to be an 
image you’ve taken with the Galaxy Tab; any image you find in the Gallery 
app will do. Follow these steps:
	
1.	View an image in the gallery.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose Set Picture As.
	
	 If the Set Picture As command doesn’t appear, you cannot use that 
image; not every album allows its images to be set for contacts.
	
4.	Choose Contact Photo.
	
5.	Scroll the Tab’s Contacts list and choose a particular contact.
	
	 You can use the Search command to easily locate a contact when you 
have an abundance of them.
	
6.	Crop the image.
	
	 Refer to the later section, “Cropping an image,” for detailed instructions 
on working the crop-thing.
	
7.	Touch the OK button.
	
	 Or, touch the X (Cancel) button to chicken out or change your mind.
The contact’s image is set and you’re returned to view the image in the 
gallery.
Images changed for a Google contact are instantly synchronized with your 
Google account on the Internet.

168
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Setting an image as wallpaper
You can choose as the Galaxy Tab’s Home screen background or wallpaper 
any picture that’s viewable in the Gallery app. Basically, you follow the same 
steps as outlined in the preceding section, but in Step 4, choose Lock Screen 
or Wallpaper instead of Contact Photo. Then skip to Step 6.
The Lock Screen is the background image you see when the Tab is locked; 
the Wallpaper is the background displayed behind icons and widgets on the 
Home screen.
Touch the Home icon button to see the new wallpaper.
You can also change wallpaper by long-pressing the Home screen and choos­
ing the Wallpapers category. See Chapter 20 for details.
Edit and Manage the Gallery
The best tool for image editing is a computer amply equipped with photo-
editing software, such as Photoshop or one of its less expensive alternatives. 
Even so, it’s possible to use the Gallery app to perform some minor photo 
surgery. This section highlights a few of the more useful things you can do.
Cropping an image
One of the few, true image-editing commands available in the Gallery app 
is Crop. You can use Crop to slice out portions of an image, such as when 
removing ex-spouses and convicts from a family portrait. To crop an image, 
obey these directions:
	
1.	Summon the image you want to crop.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
	 If you can’t see the button, touch the screen, and it reappears.
	
3.	Choose Crop.
	
	 If the Crop command is unavailable, you have to choose another image. 
(Not every album lets you modify images.)
	
4.	Work the crop-thing.
	
	 You can drag the orange rectangle around to choose which part of the 
image to crop. Drag an edge of the rectangle to resize the left and right 

169
 Chapter 12: Galaxy Gallery
or top and bottom sides. Or, drag a corner of the rectangle to change the 
rectangle’s size proportionally. Use Figure 12-6 as your guide.
Move rectangle
Resize rectangle
Crop
Cancel
Discarded
Kept
Figure 12-6: Working the crop-thing.
	
5.	Touch the Ok button when you’re done cropping.
	
	 Only the portion of the image within the orange rectangle is saved; the 
rest is discarded.
There’s no way to undo a crop action after you’ve touched the Ok button.
	
Working the rectangle to crop an image can be frustrating. When the image 
zooms in too small, you may have difficulty zooming back out. At that point, 
you can touch the X (Cancel) button and start over again.
Deleting pictures and videos
It’s entirely possible, and often desirable, to remove unwanted, embarrass­
ing, or questionably legal images and videos from the Gallery.
	
	 To zap a single image, summon the image on the screen and touch the Trash 
icon that appears in the upper-right corner. Choose the Confirm Delete com­
mand. The image is gone.

170
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Deleting a video isn’t as easy as removing an image: You have to long-press 
the video thumbnail in an album. The long-press activates multiple-selection 
mode, which is covered in the later section, “Selecting multiple pictures 
and videos.” For removing a video, however, just touch the Trash icon that 
appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. Choose the Confirm Delete 
command, and the video is gone.
	
✓	You can’t undelete an image or a video you’ve deleted. There’s no way 
to recover such an image using available tools on the Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	Some images can’t be edited, such as images brought in from social net­
working sites or from online photo-sharing albums.
	
✓	You can delete a whole swath of images by selecting a group at a time. 
See the later section, “Selecting multiple pictures and videos,” for 
details.
Rotating pictures
Which way is up? Well, the answer depends on your situation. For taking 
pictures with the Galaxy Tab, sometimes images just don’t appear “up,” no 
matter how you turn the Tab. To fix that situation, heed these steps:
	
1.	Choose an image to rotate.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose the More command.
	
4.	Choose Rotate Left to rotate the image counterclockwise; choose 
Rotate Right to rotate the image clockwise.
	
You can rotate a whole slew of images at one time: Select all the images as 
described in the next section. Choose More and then Rotate Left or Rotate 
Right. All the images are rotated at one time.
	
✓	You cannot rotate videos.
	
✓	You cannot rotate certain images, such as images shared from your 
Picasa Web Albums.
Selecting multiple pictures and videos
You can apply the Delete and Rotate commands to an entire swath of items 
in the gallery at once. To do so, you must know the secret, which I carefully 
divulge in these steps:

171
 Chapter 12: Galaxy Gallery
	
1.	Open the album (pile) you want to mess with.
	
2.	Long-press an image to select it.
	
	 Instantly, you activate image-selection mode. (That’s my name for it.) 
The screen changes to look like Figure 12-7.
Cancel selection
Rotate commands
Delete image
Share
Select everything
Selected items
Figure 12-7: Choosing images to mess with.
	
3.	Continue touching images and videos to select them.
	
	 Or you can choose the Select All command, shown in Figure 12-7.
	
4.	Perform an action on the group of images or videos.
	
	 Later sections describe specifically what you can do.
To deselect items, touch them again. To deselect everything, touch the Done 
command, shown in Figure 12-7.
The type of commands you can use on a group of items in an album depends 
on the group. Some commands, such as Delete and Share, can be performed 
on any old group. Other commands, such as the image rotation commands, 
work only with pictures, not with videos.

172
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Set Your Pics and Vids Free
Keeping your precious moments and memories in the Galaxy Tab is an 
elegant solution to the problem of lugging around photo albums. But when 
you want to show your pictures to the widest possible audience, you need 
a much larger stage. That stage is the Internet, and you have many ways to 
send and save your pictures and videos online, as covered in this section.
Refer to Chapter 18 for information on synchronizing and sharing information 
between the Galaxy Tab and your computer.
Accessing your Picasa account
Part of your Google account includes access to the online photo-sharing 
website, Picasa Web. If you haven’t yet been to the Picasa Web site on the 
Internet, use your computer to visit this website:
http://picasaweb.google.com
Configure things by logging into your Google account on that website.
The Picasa account should be synchronized and configured automatically 
with your Galaxy Tab. So if you’ve saved pictures on the Picasa Web site, you 
can find them on the Tab similar to those shown in Figure 12-1. If not, follow 
these steps to ensure that Picasa is being property synched:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Open the Settings icon.
	
3.	Choose Accounts & Sync.
	
4.	Choose your Google account from the list under Manage Accounts.
	
5.	Ensure that there’s a check mark by the item Sync Picasa Web 
Albums.
	
	 That’s pretty much it.
Any images you have on Picasa Web are automatically copied to your Galaxy 
Tab from now on.
Of course if you prefer not to have Picasa synchronize your images, repeat 
the steps in this section but remove the check mark in Step 5.

173
 Chapter 12: Galaxy Gallery
	
	
✓	Picasa Albums feature the Picasa logo on them, as shown in the margin.
	
	
✓	The best way to manage Picasa Web images is to go to the Picasa Web 
site on the Internet.
Printing your pictures
A trick you wouldn’t expect to find on a portable gizmo is the ability to print 
your lovely photos. The Galaxy Tab is more than up to the task, if you have 
a Bluetooth printer and you’ve survived the ordeal of connecting (pairing) 
the printer to your Tab. That task is covered in Chapter 17, and it’s required 
before the topic of printing pictures can even be whispered around the 
Galaxy Tab.
When you have the Tab and a Bluetooth printer paired and on speaking 
terms, obey these steps to print an image in the gallery:
	
1.	Ensure that the Tab’s Bluetooth wireless radio is on.
	
	 Refer to Chapter 17 for information about Bluetooth.
	
2.	Ensure that the Bluetooth printer is on, that its Bluetooth radio is on, 
and that the printer is stocked with ink and paper, ready to print.
	
3.	Open the Gallery app and browse to find the image you want to 
enshrine on paper.
	
	
4.	Touch the Share button.
	
	
	 You see a menu of places and methods by which you can share the 
image.
	
	
5.	Choose Bluetooth.
	
6.	Choose the Bluetooth printer from the Bluetooth Device Picker 
window.
	
7.	If prompted by the printer, confirm that the image upload is okay.
	
	 Not every Bluetooth printer has such a prompt; some just go ahead and 
print the image.
Bluetooth printing isn’t perfect. For example, your Galaxy Tab may not rec­
ognize the Bluetooth printer. It happens. As an alternative, you can attach an 
image to an e-mail message, send it to yourself, and then print it from your 
computer.

174
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Posting your video to YouTube
The best way to share a video is to upload it to YouTube. As a Google 
account holder, you also have a YouTube account. You can use the YouTube 
app on the Galaxy Tab along with your account to upload your videos to 
the Internet, where everyone can see them and make rude comments about 
them. Here’s how:
	
1.	Ensure that the Wi-Fi connection is activated.
	
	 The best way to upload a video is to turn on the Wi-Fi connection, which 
doesn’t incur data surcharges like the digital cellular network. In fact, if 
you opt to use the 4G LTE network for uploading a YouTube video, you’ll 
see a suitable reminder about the data surcharges.
	
2.	Start the Gallery app.
	
3.	Open the album containing the video you want to upload.
	
4.	Long-press the video.
	
	
5.	Touch the Share button.
	
	
6.	Choose YouTube.
	
	
	 The Upload Video window appears, listing all sorts of options and 
settings for sending the video to YouTube.
	
7.	Type the video’s title.
	
8.	Touch the More Details button.
	
9.	Scroll through the list of options.
	
	 You can type a description, specify whether to make the video public or 
private, add tags, or change other settings.
	
10.	Touch the Upload button.
	
	 You return to the gallery, and the video is uploaded. It continues to 
upload even if the Galaxy Tab falls asleep.
	
	 The uploading notification appears while the video is being sent to YouTube. 
When the upload has completed, the notification stops animating and 
becomes the Uploads Finished icon, as shown in the margin.
To view your video, open the YouTube app. It’s found on the Apps Menu 
screen and discussed in detail in Chapter 15.

175
 Chapter 12: Galaxy Gallery
	
✓	YouTube often takes awhile to process a video after it’s uploaded. 
Allow a few minutes to pass (longer for larger videos) before the video 
becomes available for viewing.
	
✓	Upload is the official term to describe sending a file from the Galaxy Tab 
to the Internet.
	
✓	See Chapter 15 for more information on using YouTube.
Sharing with the Share menu
Occasionally, you stumble across the Share command when working with 
photos and videos in the Gallery app. This command is used to distribute 
images and videos from your Galaxy Tab to your pals in the digital realms.
The menu that appears when you touch the Share icon button contains vari­
ous options for sharing media. The number and variety of items that appear 
depend on the apps installed on your Tab, which Internet services you 
belong to (Facebook and Twitter, for example), and which type of media is 
being shared.
Here’s a quick summary of the various items you may find on the Share or 
Share Via menu, as well as how they work:
Bluetooth: You can use the Bluetooth networking standard to send images to 
a Bluetooth printer or to upload the images to a Bluetooth-enabled computer. 
Printing with Bluetooth is covered earlier in this chapter, in the section 
“Printing your pictures.”
Facebook, Google+, Twitter: Sharing pictures on a social networking site is 
simple: Choose the image and then choose the social networking site from 
the Share menu. Fill in the information on the next screen, and soon the 
image is shared with all your friends and followers. See Chapter 8 for more 
information on social networking on the Galaxy Tab.
Email and Gmail: Choosing Email or Gmail for sharing sends the media file 
from your Galaxy Tab as a message attachment. Fill in the To, Subject, and 
Message text boxes as necessary. Touch the Send button to send the media.
Picasa: The Picasa photo-sharing site is one of those free services you get 
with your Google account. See the section “Accessing your Picasa account” 
for details on sharing images with Picasa.
YouTube: The YouTube sharing option appears whenever you choose to 
share a video from the Gallery app. See the section “Posting your video to 
YouTube.”

t has no mouth, but yet it can sing!
The Galaxy Tab’s amazing arsenal of features 
includes its ability to play music. So it effectively 
replaces any gramophone that you’ve been lugging 
around, which is the whole idea behind such an 
all-in-one gizmo like the Galaxy Tab. You can cheer­
fully and adeptly transfer all your old Edison cyl­
inders and 78 LPs over to the Galaxy Tab for your 
listening enjoyment. This chapter tells you how.
Your Hit Parade
The primary source of your musical joy on the Galaxy Tab is an 
app aptly named Music. You can find that app on the Apps Menu, or there 
may be a handy shortcut right on the main Home screen.

178
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Browsing your Music library
Songs stored on your Galaxy Tab are accessed through the Music app. After 
you start that app, you see a screen similar to Figure 13-1. If you just got your 
Galaxy Tab, you may not yet see any music. That’s okay; the later section, 
“Add Some Music to Your Life,” explains how to add music.

The music stored on your Galaxy Tab is presented in the Music app by cat­
egory. You choose a category from the Category menu, shown in Figure 13-1. 
There are several categories:
New and recent: Songs and albums are listed in a cascade in the order 
you’ve imported from your computer or purchased online. Scroll the list 
left or right to find recent items.
Albums: Music is organized by album, as shown in Figure 13-1. Choose 
an album to list its songs.
Artists: Songs are listed by recording artist or group. Choose Artist to 
see those songs listed by album.
Songs: All music (songs and audio) is listed individually in alphabetical 
order.

179
 Chapter 13: The Galaxy Is Alive with the Sound of Music
Playlists: Music you’ve organized into playlists that you create. Choose 
a playlist name to view songs organized in that playlist. Included are 
recently played songs, favorites, and other preset categories.
Genres: Audio is organized by categories such as Rock, Vocal, and 
Classical.
These categories are merely ways the music is organized — ways to make the 
music easier to find when you may know an artist’s name but not an album 
title. The Genres category is for those times when you’re in a mood for a cer­
tain type of music but don’t know or don’t mind who recorded it.
A playlist is a list you create yourself to organize songs by favorite, theme, 
mood, or whatever other characteristic you want. The section “Organize 
Your Music,” later in this chapter, discusses playlists.
	
✓	Music is stored on the Galaxy Tab’s internal memory.
	
✓	The size of the internal memory limits the total amount of music that 
can be stored on your Tab. Also, consider that storing pictures and 
videos horns in on some of the space that can be used to store music.
	
✓	Two types of album artwork are used by the Music app. For purchased 
music, the album artwork represents the original album. That may also 
happen for music copied (imported) from your computer. Otherwise, 
the Music app slaps down a generic album cover, as shown in Figure 13-1.
	
✓	There’s no easy or obvious way to apply album cover artwork to music 
with a generic album cover.
	
✓	When the Galaxy Tab can’t recognize an artist, it uses the title Unknown 
Artist. It usually happens with music you copy manually to your Tab, 
but it can also apply to audio recordings you make yourself.
Playing a tune
To listen to music by locating a song in your Music library, as described in 
the preceding section, touch the song title, and the song plays, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.
While the song plays, you’re free to do anything else on the Galaxy Tab. In 
fact, the song continues to play even when the Tab goes to sleep.
After the song is done playing, the next song in the list plays. The list order 
depends on how you start the song. For example, if you start a song from the 
album view, all songs in that album play in the order listed.

trols in the notification to pause the song or to skip forward or backward.
	
✓	Volume is set by using the Volume switch on the left side of the Galaxy 
Tab: Up is louder; down is quieter.
	
✓	While browsing the Music library, you see the currently playing song 
displayed at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 13-1.
	
	
✓	When you’re browsing your Music library, you may see a green song-is-
playing icon, similar to the one shown in the margin. This icon flags any 
song that’s playing or paused.
	
	
✓	Determining which song plays next depends on how you chose the song 
that’s playing. If you choose a song by artist, all songs from that artist 
play, one after the other. When you choose a song by album, that album 
plays. Choosing a song from the entire song list causes all songs in the 
Music library to play.
	
✓	To choose which songs play after each other, create a playlist. See the 
section “Organize Your Music,” later in this chapter.
	
✓	After the last song in the list plays, the Music app stops playing songs — 
unless you have the List Repeat option set, in which case the list plays 
again.
	
	
✓	You can use the Galaxy Tab’s search abilities to help locate tunes in 
your Music library. You can search by artist name, song title, or album. 
The key is to touch the Search icon button when you’re using the Music 
app. Type all or part of the text you’re searching for and touch the 
Search button on the onscreen keyboard. Choose the song you want to 
hear from the list that’s displayed.

Being the life of the party
You need to do four things to make your Galaxy Tab the soul of your next 
shindig or soirée:
	
✓	Connect it to a stereo.
	
✓	Use the Shuffle command.
	
✓	Set the Repeat command.
	
✓	Provide plenty of drinks and snacks.
Hook the Galaxy Tab into any stereo that has a standard line input. You need, 
on one end, an audio cable that has a mini-headphone jack and, on the other 
end, an audio input that matches your stereo. Look for such a cable at Radio 
Shack or any stereo store.
After you connect your Tab, start the Music app and choose the party play­
list you’ve created. If you want the songs to play in random order, touch the 
Shuffle button.
You might also consider choosing the List Repeat command (see Table 13-1) 
so that all songs in the playlist repeat.
	
To play all songs saved on your Galaxy Tab, choose the Songs category and 
touch the first song in the list.
Enjoy your party, and please drink responsibly.
Add Some Music to Your Life
Odds are good that your Galaxy Tab came with no music preinstalled. It 
might have: Some cellular providers may have preinstalled a smattering 
of tunes, which merely lets you know how out of touch they are musically. 
Regardless, you can add music to your Galaxy Tab in a number of ways, as 
covered in this section.
Borrowing music from your computer
Your computer is the equivalent of the 20th-century stereo system — a 
combination tuner, amplifier, and turntable, plus all your records and CDs. If 
you’ve already copied your music collection to your computer, or if you use 
your computer as your main music storage system, you can share that music 
with your Galaxy Tab.

183
 Chapter 13: The Galaxy Is Alive with the Sound of Music
Many music-playing, or jukebox, programs are available. On Windows, the 
most common program is Windows Media Player. You can use this program 
to synchronize music between your PC and the Galaxy Tab. Here’s how it 
works:
	
1.	Connect the Galaxy Tab to your PC.
	
	 Use the USB cable that comes with the Tab.
	
	 Over on the PC, an AutoPlay dialog box appears in Windows, prompting 
you to choose how best to mount the Galaxy Tab into the Windows stor­
age system.
	
2.	Close the AutoPlay dialog box.
	
3.	Start Windows Media Player.
	
4.	Click the Sync tab or Sync toolbar button.
	
	 The Galaxy Tab appears in the Sync list on the right side of the Windows 
Media Player, as shown in Figure 13-3.

5.	Drag to the Sync Area the music you want to transfer to your Tab. 
(Refer to Figure 13-3.)

184
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
6.	Click the Start Sync button to transfer the music from your PC to the 
Galaxy Tab.
	
	 The Sync button may be located atop the list, as shown in Figure 13-3, or 
it might be found on the bottom.
	
7.	Close the Windows Media Player when you’re done transferring 
music.
	
	 Or, you can keep it open — whatever.
	
8.	Unplug the USB cable.
	
	 Or, you can leave the Tab plugged in.
When you have a Macintosh, or you detest Windows Media Player, you can 
use the doubleTwist program to synchronize music between your Galaxy Tab 
and your computer. Refer to the section about synchronizing with 
doubleTwist in Chapter 18 for more information.
	
✓	You must mount the Galaxy Tab — specifically, its MicroSD card — into 
your computer’s storage system before you can synchronize music.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab can store only so much music! Don’t be overzealous 
when copying your tunes. In Windows Media Player (refer to Figure 
13-3), a capacity thermometer-thing shows you how much storage 
space is used and how much is available on your Tab. Pay heed to 
the indicator!
	
✓	Windows Media Player complains when you try to sync the Galaxy Tab 
to more than one PC. If you do, you’re warned after Step 6 in this sec­
tion. It’s not a big issue: Just inform Windows Media Player that you 
intend to sync with the computer for only this session.
	
✓	You can’t use iTunes to synchronize music with the Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	Okay, I lied in the preceding point: You can synchronize music using 
iTunes but only when you install the iTunes Agent program on your 
PC. You then need to configure the iTunes Agent program to use your 
Galaxy Tab with iTunes. After you do that, iTunes recognizes the Galaxy 
Tab and lets you synchronize your music. Yes, it’s technical; hence the 
icon in the margin.
Buying music at the Amazon MP3 store
A more specific solution for buying music for the Galaxy Tab is to use the 
Amazon MP3 store. It’s a universal approach, which works on just about 
every Android device, including the Galaxy Tab.

185
 Chapter 13: The Galaxy Is Alive with the Sound of Music
	
The best way to use the Amazon MP3 store is to have an Amazon account. If 
you don’t have one set up, use your computer to visit www.amazon.com and 
create one. You also need to keep a credit card on file for the account, which 
makes purchasing music with the Galaxy Tab work O so well.
	
	 You also need to download the Amazon MP3 app for your Tab. Scan the 
barcode in the margin and refer to Chapter 16 for information on obtaining 
new apps.
Follow these steps to buy music from the Amazon MP3 store:
	
1.	Ensure that you’re using a Wi-Fi or high-speed digital network 
connection.
	
	 Activating the Tab’s Wi-Fi is described in Chapter 17.
	
2.	From the Apps Menu, choose the Amazon MP3 app.
	
	 The Amazon MP3 app connects you with the online Amazon music store, 
where you can search or browse for tunes to preview and purchase for 
your Galaxy Tab.
	
	 The Amazon MP3 store presents you with two options for purchasing 
music: Store and Player. The Store option is where you buy music to 
download to your Galaxy Tab. The Player option, which I don’t cover 
here, lets you save your music on the Internet, where you can play it 
from any device connected to the Internet.
	
3.	Touch the Store button.
	
4.	Fill in the Search Amazon MP3 text field to begin your music quest.
	
	 Or, you can browse by top-selling songs and albums, new releases, or 
browse by category.
	
5.	Choose a result.
	
	 If the result is an album, choosing it displays the album’s tracks. 
Otherwise, an audio preview plays.
	
	 When the result is an album, choose a song in the album to hear the 
preview.
	
	 Touch the song again to stop the preview.
	
6.	To purchase the song, touch the big button with the amount in it.
	
	 Some buttons say FREE, for free songs.
	
	 Touching the button doesn’t purchase the song. Instead, its text changes 
into the word BUY.
	
7.	Touch the word BUY.

186
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
8.	If necessary, you may need to accept the license agreement.
	
	 This step happens the first time you buy something from the Amazon 
MP3 store.
	
9.	Sign in to your Amazon.com account: Type your account name or 
e-mail address and password.
	
	 Your purchase is registered, account authorized, and download started. 
If they aren’t, touch the Retry button to try again.
	
10.	Wait while the music downloads.
	
	 Well, actually, you don’t have to wait: The music continues to download 
while you do other things on the Tab.
No notification icon appears when the song or album has finished download­
ing. Notice, however, that the MP3 Store Downloading icon vanishes from the 
notification part of the screen. It’s your clue that the new music is ready for 
your ears.
	
✓	Amazon e-mails you a bill for your purchase. That’s your purchase 
record, so I advise you to be a good accountant and print it and then 
input it into your bookkeeping program or personal finance program 
at once!
	
	
✓	You can review your Amazon MP3 store purchases by touching the 
bottom Menu icon button in the Amazon MP3 app and choosing the 
Downloads command.
Organize Your Music
The Music app categorizes your music by album, artist, song, and so forth, 
but unless you have only one album and enjoy all the songs on it, that con­
figuration probably won’t do. To better organize your music, you can create 
Say “Hello” to the Music Hub
The Wi-Fi Galaxy Tab ships with an app called 
the Music Hub. If you don’t see that app on the 
cellular Tab, you’re not really missing much: 
The Music Hub is merely a place to browse and 
shop for music, though it also gives you access 
to playlists and other features beyond a music-
buying app like the Amazon MP3 store, such 
as the ability to create playlists and a personal 
page.

187
 Chapter 13: The Galaxy Is Alive with the Sound of Music
playlists. That way, you can hear the music you want to hear, in the order you 
want, for whatever mood hits you.
Reviewing your playlists
Any playlists you’ve already created, or that have been preset on the Tab, 
appear in the Playlists category, which you can choose from the Category 
menu in Music app. (Refer to Figure 13-1.) Any playlists you’ve created are 
displayed on the screen, as shown in Figure 13-4.
Category menu
Add new playlist
Playlist name
Songs in playlist
Current song
Show playlist menu
Playlist menu
Figure 13-4: Playlists in the Music app.
To see which songs are in a playlist, touch the playlist album icon. To play 
the songs in the playlist, touch the first song in the list. Or you can choose 
the Play command from the playlist’s menu, as shown in Figure 13-4.
	
A playlist is a helpful way to organize music when a song’s information may 
not have been completely imported into the Galaxy Tab. For example, if 
you’re like me, you probably have a lot of songs labeled Unknown. A quick 
way to remedy that situation is to name a playlist after the artist and then 
add those unknown songs to the playlist. The next section describes how 
it’s done.

188
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Creating your own playlists
Making a new playlist is easy, and adding songs to the playlist is even easier. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose the Playlist category from the Category menu in the Music app.
	
	 Refer to Figure 13-4 for the location of the Category menu.
	
2.	Touch the Add button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	
3.	Type a name for your playlist.
	
	 Short and descriptive names are best.
	
4.	Touch the OK button to create the playlist.
	
	 The new playlist is created and placed into the Playlists screen, similar 
to what’s shown in Figure 13-4.
But the playlist is empty! To add songs you need to go out and fetch them, 
adding each one to a playlist. Here’s how you do that:
	
1.	Hunt down the song you want to add to a playlist.
	
	 You don’t need to play the song, simply display the song in the Music app.
	
	 Likewise, you can hunt down albums, artists, or even genres. The tech­
nique described in this set of steps works for every category in the 
Music app.
	
2.	Touch the menu triangle by the song (or album or artist).
	
3.	Choose the command Add to Playlist.
	
4.	Choose a playlist.
	
	 The song (or album or artist) is added to the playlist’s repertoire of 
music.
Repeat this set of steps to continue adding songs to playlists.
You can have as many playlists as you like on the Galaxy Tab and stick as 
many songs as you like into them. Adding songs to a playlist doesn’t notice­
ably affect the Tab’s storage capacity.
	
✓	To remove a song from a playlist, open the playlist and touch the menu 
triangle by the song. Choose the Delete command and then touch Ok to 
confirm.
	
✓	Removing a song from a playlist doesn’t delete the song from the Galaxy 
Tab’s Music library.

189
 Chapter 13: The Galaxy Is Alive with the Sound of Music
	
✓	Songs in a playlist can be rearranged: While viewing the playlist, use 
the tab on the far left end of a song title to drag that song up or down in 
the list.
	
✓	To delete a playlist, touch the menu triangle in the playlist icon’s lower-
right corner. (Refer to Figure 13-4.) Choose the Delete command. Touch 
Delete.
Removing unwanted music
To purge music from your Galaxy, follow these brief, painless steps:
	
1.	Locate the music that offends you.
	
	 You can choose any music category except Playlist; deleting music from 
a playlist doesn’t permanently remove it from the Tab. I recommend 
using the Songs category.
	
2.	Touch the menu triangle button by the song.
	
	 Or you can choose the menu triangle button by an artist, album, or just 
about any other category in the Music app.
	
3.	Choose Delete.
	
	 A warning message appears.
	
4.	Touch Ok to confirm.
	
	 The music is gone. La, la, la, la: The music is gone.
The music is deleted permanently from the Galaxy Tab’s internal storage.
By deleting music, you free up a modicum of storage space, though you can’t 
recover any music you delete. If you want the song back, you have to reinstall 
it, sync it, or buy it again, as described elsewhere in this chapter.
Soap, No Soap, Galaxy Radio
Though they’re not broadcast radio stations, some sources on the Internet — 
Internet radio sites — play music. Lamentably, the Galaxy Tab doesn’t come 
with any Internet radio apps, but that doesn’t stop you from finding a few 
good ones at the Android Market. There are three I can recommend:
	
✓	TuneIn Radio
	
✓	Pandora Radio
	
✓	StreamFurious

190
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
	 The TuneIn Radio app gives you access to hundreds of Internet radio stations 
broadcasting around the world. They’re organized by category, so you can 
find just about whatever you want. Many of the radio stations are also broad­
cast radio stations, so odds are good you can find a local station or two, 
which you can listen to on your Galaxy Tab.
	
	 Pandora Radio lets you select music based on your mood and customizes, 
according to your feedback, the tunes you listen to. The app works like the 
Internet site www.pandora.com, in case you’re familiar with it. The nifty 
thing about Pandora is that the more you listen, the better the app gets at 
finding music you like.
	
	 StreamFurious streams music from various radio stations on the Internet. 
Though not as customizable as Pandora, StreamFurious uses less bandwidth 
so you can enjoy your music without having to risk running up digital cellular 
surcharges.
All these apps are available at the Android Market. They’re free, though paid 
versions might also be available.
	
✓	It’s best to listen to Internet radio when your Tab is connected to the 
Internet via a Wi-Fi connection. Streaming music can use a lot of your 
cellular data plan’s data allotment.
	
✓	See Chapter 16 for more information about the Android Market.
	
✓	Internet music of the type delivered by the apps mentioned in this sec­
tion is referred to by the nerds as streaming music. That’s because the 
music arrives on your Galaxy Tab as a continuous download from the 
source. Unlike music you download and save, streaming music is played 
as it comes in and not stored long-term.

efore writing was invented, information was stored in the human head 
and relayed from person to person through stories. After writing was 
invented, early Cro-Magnon scientists determined that something convenient 
must be developed on which to write. Stone tablets were okay, but hardly 
portable. Then came papyrus scrolls, bound books, and then in the 21st 
century, the eBook.
The eBook, or electronic book, is the latest, best develop­
ment in the art of storing the written word. Rather than 
load yourself down with bulky, printed tomes, you can 
carry something light and electronic like the Galaxy 
Tab. Armed with eBook reader software, you can 
have a whole library of reading fun always available 
to provide entertainment and information.
Why Don’t You Read 
It on the Road?
Welcome to the latest craze in publishing: eBooks, or 
electronic books. It’s important to know that eBooks is pro­
nounced “ee-books,” not “eb-ooks,” which makes no sense but, 
honestly, given weird technology jargon, who really knows?

192
Part III: The Everything Tab 
An eBook is essentially a digital version of the material you would normally 
see on paper. The words, formatting, figures, pictures — all that stuff is 
simply stored digitally so that you can read it on some sort of eBook reader. 
In the case of the Galaxy Tab, you need eBook software, which is included in 
the form of the Books app.
The primary advantage of an eBook reader is that you can keep an entire 
library of books with you. So rather than pay way too much for the latest pot­
boiler in an airport bookstore, you can shop online before you leave and take 
an eBook with you. That way, when you’re bored with reading your e-mail, 
surfing the web, playing games, checking your stocks, or chatting it up with a 
friend, you can read books on your Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab was supposed to ship with an app called the Reader’s 
Hub. It would have been the Tab’s primary eBook reader, library, and 
book-buying app. It may appear with a future update of the Galaxy 
Tab’s software, but as this book goes to press, the Reader’s Hub is 
not available.
	
✓	Just about any current, popular title you can buy in a bookstore or 
online is available in the eBook format.
	
✓	You can also use eBook reader software to view periodicals — magazines 
and newspapers — as long as you pay for the subscription and the 
eBook-reading software you’re using allows for daily updates.
	
✓	eBook titles cost money, though they’re generally cheaper than their 
real-world equivalents.
	
✓	It’s easy and free to build up your eBook library with classics and older 
books. Most of those titles are free, though some compilations have a 
modest price tag, such as 99 cents.
Google Does Books
Your Galaxy Tab comes with Google’s own eBook reader app. It has the 
clever name Books, and it can be found on the Apps Menu along with all the 
other apps installed on your Tab.
	
✓	The Books app may come preinstalled with some free books for you to 
try. If not, getting free books is easy, as described in this section.
	
✓	Because the Books app is from Google, it uses the Android Market as 
your online bookstore. See Chapter 16 for more information about the 
Android Market.

193
 Chapter 14: Your Digital Library
Using the Books app
The Books app organizes the books into a library and displays the books for 
reading on your Galaxy Tab.
Begin your reading experience by opening the Books app, found on the Apps 
Menu. If you’re prompted to turn on Synchronization, touch the Turn On 
Sync button.
The Books app main screen displays your eBook library, looking similar to 
Figure 14-1. The library lists any titles you’ve obtained for your Google Books 
account. Or, when you’re returning to the Books app after a break, you see 
the current page of the eBook you were last reading.
Buy more books at the Android Market
Scroll library left and right
Figure 14-1: The Books library.
Scroll through the library by swiping the screen left or right. To begin read­
ing, touch a book to open it. The next section covers how you read a book 
using the Books app.
	
✓	If you don’t see a book in the library, touch the Menu icon button and 
choose the Refresh command.
	
✓	To ensure that your reading material is always available, touch the 
Menu icon button and choose the Make Available Offline command. That 
way, the Galaxy Tab doesn’t have to access the Internet in order to syn­
chronize and download books from the library. I choose that command 

194
Part III: The Everything Tab 
specifically before I leave on a trip where an Internet signal may not be 
available (such as in an airplane).
	
✓	If you want only a specific eBook to be available offline, long-press it and 
choose the Make Available Offline command.
	
✓	To remove a book from the library, long-press the cover and choose the 
Remove From My eBooks command. There is no confirmation: The book 
is instantly removed.
	
✓	Synchronization allows you to keep copies of your Google Books on all 
your Android devices, as well as on the http://books.google.com 
website.
Reading a Books eBook
The eBook experience on the Galaxy Tab should be familiar to you, especially 
if you’re reading this text in a real book. The entire page-turning and reading 
operation works the same. The only major difference is that you can read 
a physical book without batteries and in direct sunlight, but I won’t dwell 
on that.
Touch a book in the Books app library to open it. If you’ve opened the book 
previously, you’re returned to the page you last read. Otherwise, the first 
page you see is the book’s first page.
Figure 14-2 illustrates the basic book-reading operation in the Books app. 
You turn pages by swiping left or right, but probably mostly left. You can also 
turn pages by touching the far left or right sides of the screen. 
The Books app also works in a vertical orientation, though when you turn the 
Tab that way, only one page is shown at a time.
	
✓	If the onscreen controls (refer to Figure 14-2) disappear, touch the 
screen to see them again.
	
✓	The Aa button is used to adjust the display. Touching that button dis­
plays a palette of options for adjusting the text on the screen and the 
brightness.
	
✓	To return to the library, touch the Books button in the upper-left corner 
of the screen or touch the Back icon button.

Buying books
Nothing is more delightful for an author to write about than buying books, 
especially when he’s urging someone else to do it. For the Books app, you 
obtain new titles — free or paid — from the Android Market, the same place 
you visit to obtain apps for your Galaxy Tab.
To quickly visit the Android Market’s online bookstore, touch the Shop 
button on the Book app’s main screen. (Refer to Figure 14-1.) You can also 
start the Market app and choose Books from the main screen.
Search for books, browse the categories, or use the Search button to locate a 
specific title, topic, or author.
	
✓	Books with a price button must be purchased using your Google 
Checkout account. The process is the same as for buying an app: See 
Chapter 16 for the specifics.
	
✓	Free books have a Free button.

196
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
✓	Books you obtain from the Market, free or paid, can be synchronized 
with any Android device you have where the Books app is installed. Use 
the Refresh command, discussed in the earlier section, “Using the Books 
app,” to synchronize books between your various Android gizmos.
The Kindle eBook Reader
The good folks at Amazon recognize that after buying yourself a Galaxy Tab, 
you’ll probably never have use for their fancy eBook reader, the Kindle. 
Those fools who dare take a Kindle on a transcontinental flight can seethe 
with jealousy as they sit across the aisle from you, knowing how much better 
the Galaxy Tab is than the Kindle gizmo.
You’ll say, “Hey! I see you have a Kindle.” Then you’ll snicker.
The Kindle owner will be miffed and will most likely respond, “Well, I see that 
you don’t have an iPad!”
Just chuckle softly to yourself. That’s because both you and the silly Kindle 
owner are probably using the same software to read your Kindle eBooks.
Obtaining the Kindle app
	
	 You can pick up a copy of the Kindle app free at the Android Market. Use the 
QR code in the margin or simply visit the Market and search for Kindle. Install 
the app on your phone, carefully following the directions listed in Chapter 16.
The first time you start the Kindle app, you may be asked to register or sign 
in to your Amazon account. Do so. By signing in, you can instantly coordinate 
your Kindle eBook library with any previous purchases you may have made.
The Kindle app’s main interface is illustrated in Figure 14-3. It shows a scroll­
ing list of your eBook library, plus it gives you quick access to the Kindle 
Store to buy even more books. And everyone should buy more books.
Figure 14-3 shows archived books in the Kindle library. Those are titles 
you’ve already purchased from the Kindle Store, either online or from 
another Android or Kindle gizmo. They’re archived because they haven’t yet 
been transferred to your Galaxy Tab. To do so, touch the title, as illustrated 
in Figure 14-3.

✓	If you don’t yet have an account on Amazon, get one! Visit www.amazon.
com and follow the directions to sign up and create an account. Maybe 
even buy a nice sweater or some concrete while you’re there. Amazon 
carries everything.
Getting some Kindle reading material
You can get two types of books with the Kindle app: Good and terrible. 
Regardless of their satisfaction level, the two types of books can be free or 
paid. Mostly older titles and classics are free; the rest are paid. Shopping for 
books works like this:
	
1.	Start the Kindle app on your Galaxy Tab.
	
2.	Touch the Kindle Store button.
	
	 Refer to Figure 14-3 for its location.

198
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
	 You see the Amazon Kindle Store. There are recommended books, cat­
egories to browse, plus lists — including lists of the top paid and free 
titles. It’s just like a bookstore, but you can shop in your pajamas.
	
	 Well, you can shop in your pajamas at a real-world bookstore as well, 
but no one notices when you do so at the Kindle Store.
	
3.	Search for the book you want or browse the categories.
	
	 As a suggestion, choose the category Free Popular Classics to find some­
thing free to download.
	
4.	Touch to select a title.
	
	 Free titles have $0.00 listed as their price; otherwise, you see the book’s 
cost displayed.
	
	 If you’re timid about paying for an eBook, choose the Try a Sample 
button instead. A snippet from the book is downloaded, which you can 
peruse at your leisure at no charge.
	
5.	Touch the Buy button.
	
	 Yes, it still says “Buy” even when the title is free.
	
	 After touching the Buy button, the title is downloaded (transferred from 
the Kindle Store over the Internet and into your Galaxy Tab).
	
6.	Touch the Read Now button to read your new book, or keep shopping.
	
	 As an author, I recommend that you keep shopping. Never stop book 
shopping.
You may be prompted to log in to your Amazon account again after touching 
the Buy button (Step 5). Do so. You may also be prompted to enter or choose 
a credit card if you don’t have one automatically set up for your Amazon 
account. That’s normal, and it’s perfectly safe.
See the next section for information on reading eBooks.
	
✓	You receive an e-mail confirmation message describing your purchase. 
The e-mail appears even when you “buy” a free eBook.
	
✓	Not every title is available as an eBook.
Reading on your Galaxy Tab
The whole point of getting an eBook is so that you can read the thing, flipping 
the digital pages just the same as you would in a real book, although I don’t 
recommend that you lick your finger to turn the page. (See Chapter 21 for 
information on cleaning the Galaxy Tab screen.)

199
 Chapter 14: Your Digital Library
After choosing a book in the Kindle app, you see it open on the touchscreen. 
The first time you open a book, you see the first page. Otherwise, you see the 
page you were last reading.
Figure 14-4 illustrates the basic reading maneuvers: You can touch the left or 
right sides of the screen to flip a page left or right, respectively. You can also 
swipe the pages left or right.

Long-pressing text selects the text on the screen, similar to selecting any 
text on the Galaxy Tab, as discussed in Chapter 4. A menu appears atop the 
screen when you’ve selected text. You can make a note for that chunk of text, 
highlight it, or search for text elsewhere in the same book or on Wikipedia or 
Google.
	
The Kindle app lacks a quick command to keep the screen from reorienting 
itself. To turn off screen orientation (rotation) on the Galaxy Tab, refer to 
Chapter 3.

ost gizmos are designed to solve a single problem. The food 
processor slices, grates, or chops food, but it doesn’t 
play music (though I’m sure John Cage would argue that 
point). The lawn mower is good at cutting the grass but 
terrible at telling time. And if you have a tuba, it can 
play music, but it’s a poor substitute for a hair dryer. 
That’s all well and good because people accept 
limitations on devices designed with a specific 
purpose.
The Galaxy Tab is a gizmo with many purposes. Its 
abilities are limited only by the apps you get for it. 
To help you grasp this concept, the Tab comes with 
a slate of apps preinstalled. They can give you an 
idea of what the Tab is capable of, or you can simply 
use those apps to make the Galaxy Tab a more versatile 
and useful device.

Part III: The Everything Tab 
It’s an Alarm Clock
Your Galaxy Tab keeps constant, accurate track of the time, which is dis­
played at the bottom of the Home screen as well as on the Lock screen. The 
display is lovely and informative, but it can’t actually wake you up. To have 
it do that, you need to somehow choose a specific time and apply a noise to 
that time. This process turns the Galaxy Tab into an alarm clock.
Alarm clock duties are the responsibility of the Clock app. It’s the same app 
you see if you plug the Tab into a docking station. It just displays a large digi­
tal clock on the screen, as shown in Figure 15-1.

Figure 15-1: The Clock app.
You can create alarms for the Clock app by touching the Set Alarm button, 
illustrated in Figure 15-1. You see a pop-up window where you can create or 
set alarms.
Set an alarm by touching the box, which places a green check mark by the 
alarm time and days. To create a new alarm, follow these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Set Alarm or Alarm Set button. (Refer to Figure 15-1.)
	
	 The Alarms screen appears, shown on the right in Figure 15-1.
	
2.	Choose Add Alarm.
	
3.	Touch the check box by Turn Alarm On to activate the alarm.

203
 Chapter 15: What Else Does It Do?
	
4.	Touch Time and use the pop-up window to configure the hour and 
minute and to specify either AM or PM; touch the Set button to set 
the time.
	
5.	Choose Repeat to set on which days the alarm sounds.
	
6.	Choose Ringtone to specify which music plays when the alarm sounds.
	
	 To set no ringtone, choose the Silent option, found at the top of the 
Ringtones list. But if you do that, ensure that you also set the Vibrate 
option. The alarm should signal you somehow.
	
7.	Place a check mark by the Vibrate option if you want the Tab to 
vibrate in addition to playing music.
	
8.	Touch Label to give the alarm a name.
	
	 For example, Wake up, and Get to the airport, and Annoy my spouse are 
excellent examples of good, descriptive labels.
	
9.	Touch the Done button to create the alarm.
The alarm you create appears on the Alarms screen, similar to the one shown 
in Figure 15-1.
Any new alarm you create is automatically set — it goes off when the 
proper time approaches. To disable an alarm, touch the Alarm icon shown 
in Figure 15-1.
	
Alarms must be set or else they don’t trigger. To set an alarm, touch the 
check box by the alarm, as shown in Figure 15-1.
	
✓	Turning off an alarm doesn’t delete the alarm.
	
✓	To remove an alarm, long-press it and choose the option Delete Alarm 
from the menu. Touch the OK button to confirm.
	
✓	The alarm doesn’t work when you turn off the Galaxy Tab. The alarm 
does, however, go off when the Tab is sleeping.
It’s a Very Big Calculator
The Calculator is perhaps the oldest of all computer programs. It’s probably 
also the least confusing and frustrating app to use on your Galaxy Tab.
Start the Calculator app by choosing its icon from the Apps Menu. The 
Calculator appears, as shown in Figure 15-2.

Figure 15-2: The Calculator.
Type in your equations using the various buttons on the screen. The paren­
thesis buttons can help you determine which part of a long equation gets 
calculated first. Use the Clr button to clear input.
	
✓	Long-press the calculator’s text (or results) to cut or copy the results.
	
✓	I use the Calculator most often to determine my tip at a restaurant. In 
Figure 15-2, a calculation is being made for an 18 percent tip on an 
$89.56 tab.
It’s a Calendar
Feel free to take out any datebook you have and throw it away. You never 
need to buy another one again. That’s because your Galaxy Tab is the ideal 
datebook and appointment calendar. Thanks to the Calendar app and the 
Google Calendar feature on the Internet, you can manage all your scheduling 
right on your Galaxy Tab. It’s almost cinchy.
	
✓	Google Calendar works with your Google account to keep track of your 
schedule and appointments. You can visit Google Calendar on the web at
http://calendar.google.com
	
✓	You automatically have a Google Calendar; it comes with your Google 
account.
	
✓	I recommend that you use the Calendar app on your Galaxy Tab to 
access Google Calendar. It’s a better way to access your schedule than 
using the Browser app to reach Google Calendar on the web.

205
 Chapter 15: What Else Does It Do?
	
✓	Before you throw away your datebook, copy into the Calendar app some 
future appointments and info, such as birthdays and anniversaries.
Browsing your schedule
To see what’s happening next, to peruse upcoming important events, or just 
to know which day of the month it is, summon the Calendar app. It’s located 
on the Apps Menu along with all the other apps that dwell on your Galaxy 
Tab, though there might be a shortcut icon on the first Home screen panel to 
the right of the main Home screen.
Figure 15-3 shows the Calendar app’s monthly view. It looks like a typical 
calendar, with the month and year at the top. Scheduled appointments and 
events appear on various days.
Choose calendar view

Figure 15-3: The Calendar’s Month view.
To view your appointments by week, touch the Week button. Or, you can 
touch the Day button to see your daily schedule.
	
✓	See the later section, “Creating a new event,” for information on review­
ing and creating events.
	
✓	Use Month view to see an overview of what’s going on, and use Week or 
Day view to see your appointments.

206
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
✓	I check Week view at the start of the week to remind me of what’s 
coming up.
	
✓	Different colors flag your events, as seen by the teensy squares next to 
event names in Figure 15-3. The colors represent a calendar category 
to which the events are assigned. See the later section, “Creating a new 
event,” for information on calendars.
	
✓	Use your finger to flick the calendar displays left or right to see the next 
or previous day, week, or month.
Reviewing appointments
To see more detail about an event, touch it. When you’re using Month view, 
touch the date with the event on it to see the Week view. Then choose the 
event again to see its details.
The information you see depends on how much information was recorded 
when the event was created. Some events have only a minimum of informa­
tion; others may have details, such as a location for the event. When the 
event’s location is listed, you can touch that location, and the Maps app pops 
up to show you where the event is being held.
Birthdays and a few other events on the calendar may be pulled in from your 
social networking sites. That probably explains why some events are listed 
twice; they’re pulled in from two sources.
Creating a new event
The key to making the calendar work is to add events: appointments, things 
to do, meetings, or full-day events such as birthdays or colonoscopies. To 
create a new event, follow these steps in the Calendar app:
	
1.	Select the day for the event.
	
	 Or if you like, you can switch to Day view, where you can touch the 
starting time for the new event.
	
2.	Touch the Add New Event button. (Refer to Figure 15-3.)
	
	 The New Event screen appears. Your job now is to fill in the blanks to 
create the new event.
	
	 The more information you supply, the more detailed the event, and 
the more you can do with it on your Galaxy Tab as well as on Google 
Calendar on the Internet.

207
 Chapter 15: What Else Does It Do?
	
3.	Type an event name.
	
	 Sometimes I simply write the name of the person I’m meeting.
	
4.	Choose a calendar category for the event.
	
	 Calendars are created on the Google Calendar website. You can choose 
which calendar to assign an event to only by using the Galaxy Tab’s 
Calendar app. It’s the calendars that are color-coded.
	
5.	Set the meeting duration using the From and To buttons.
	
	 Because you followed Step 1, you don’t have to set the date (unless the 
event is longer than a day). Touch the time buttons, if necessary, to 
adjust when the event starts and stops.
	
	 When the event lasts all day, such as a birthday or your mother-in-law’s 
visit that was supposed to last for an hour, touch the All Day check mark.
	
	 Steps 6 and 7 are optional:
	
6.	Type a location for the event in the Where field.
	
7.	Type a description.
	
	 Or you can use the Description field to type in notes about the event, 
such as whether to wear a tie or just show up naked.
	
8.	Specify whether the event repeats.
	
	 Touch the Repeat button to set up a recurring schedule.
	
9.	Set whether the event has a Reminder.
	
	 The Calendar app is configured to automatically set a reminder 10 min­
utes before an event begins. If you prefer not to have a reminder, touch 
the minus button by the Reminders item. You can set additional remind­
ers by using the plus button. Change the reminder time by touching the 
triangle menu button and choosing a new time value.
	
10.	Touch the Done button to create the new event.
	
	 The Done button has a check mark by it, and it’s located in the upper-
right corner of the screen.
You can change an event at any time: Simply touch the event to bring up 
more information and then touch the Details button. Choose Edit from the 
top of the screen to modify the event.
To remove an event, touch the event to bring up more information and 
touch the Delete button at the top right of the screen. Touch the OK button 
to confirm.

208
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
✓	Adding an event location not only tells you where the event will be 
located, but also hooks that information into the Maps app. My advice 
is to type information into the event’s Where field just as though you’re 
typing information to search for in the Maps app. When the event is dis­
played, the location is a clickable link; touch the link to see where it is 
on a map.
	
✓	Use the Repetition item to create repeating events, such as weekly or 
monthly meetings, anniversaries, and birthdays.
	
	
✓	Reminders can be set so that the Tab alerts you before an event takes 
place. The alert can show up as a notification icon (shown in the 
margin), or it can be an audio alert or a vibrating alert. Pull down the 
notifications and choose the calendar alert. You can then peruse pend­
ing events.
	
✓	To deal with an event notification, choose the notification as described 
in Chapter 3.
	
✓	You can also create events by using the Google Calendar on the Internet. 
Those events are instantly synced with the calendar on your Galaxy Tab.
It’s Your Video Entertainment
It’s not possible to watch “real” TV on the Galaxy Tab, but a few apps come 
close. The YouTube app is handy for watching random, meaningless drivel, 
which I suppose makes it a lot like TV. And then there’s Media Hub, which 
lets you buy and rent real movies and TV shows. And when you tire of those 
apps, you can create your own movies by using the Android Movie Studio.
Enjoying YouTube
YouTube is the Internet phenomenon that proves that real life is indeed 
too boring and random for television. Or is that the other way around? 
Regardless, you can view the latest videos on YouTube — or contribute your 
own — by using the YouTube app on your Galaxy Tab. The main YouTube 
screen is depicted in Figure 15-4.
To view a video, touch its name or icon in the list.
	
	 Touch the full-screen button to view the video in a larger size.
Browse for videos by choosing the Browse category, as shown in Figure 15-4. 
Or you can search for videos by using the Search YouTube text box, also 
shown in the figure. As a suggestion, type a search term for something you’d 
like to see, such as plane crashes, or people-eating bugs, or disappointing 
politicians.

209
 Chapter 15: What Else Does It Do?
Return to main YouTube screen
Browse for videos
Search for videos
Figure 15-4: YouTube.
	
	 Touch the Back icon button to return to the main YouTube screen after 
watching a video or if you tire of a video and need to return to the main 
screen out of boredom.
	
✓	Use the YouTube app to view YouTube videos, rather than use the 
Browser app to visit the YouTube website.
	
✓	Because you have a Google account, you also have a YouTube account. 
I recommend that you log in to your YouTube account when using 
YouTube on the Galaxy Tab: Touch the Menu icon button and choose 
the command My Account. Log in if you haven’t already. Otherwise, you 
see your account information, your videos, and any video subscriptions.
	
✓	Not all YouTube videos are available for viewing on mobile devices.
	
✓	To create and upload a video you’ve already shot to YouTube, touch the 
Your Channel button at the top of the main screen (refer to Figure 15-4); 
then touch the Upload button in the upper-right corner of the screen. 
Use the Gallery to locate a video to send to YouTube.
	
✓	Also see Chapter 11 for information on shooting video with your 
Galaxy Tab.
Buying and renting movies
The Amazon Market not only lets you buy apps and books for your Galaxy 
Tab, but you can also use it to rent movies. Further, the cellular tab comes 

210
Part III: The Everything Tab 
with an app that allows you to buy or rent films and television shows. It’s 
called the Media Hub. You can use both apps to boost the entertainment 
potential for your Tab.
Use either app, Market or Media Hub, to browse or search for movies and 
TV shows to rent or buy. Purchasing a movie at the Market works just like 
purchasing an app, so if you’ve already set up your Galaxy Tab with a Google 
Checkout account, you’re ready to go. With the Media Hub, you need to 
supply credit card or other information to make your first purchase. The 
app remembers that information for future purchases.
	
✓	Movies rented at the Market are available for viewing up to 30 days after 
you pay the rental fee. After you start the movie, you can pause and 
watch it again and again during a 24-hour period.
	
✓	To view movies rented at the Market, you need to get the Videos app. 
Don’t fret: You’re prompted to download and install the app if you don’t 
yet have a copy on your Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	One of the best ways to view movies is to connect the Tab to an HDMI 
monitor or TV set. That way you get the Big Screen experience, and 
can share the movie with several friends without having you all crowd 
around the Galaxy Tab. To get HDMI output on the Tab, you need to pur­
chase a special HDMI dongle or use the Multimedia Dock.
Making your own movies
Forget Hollywood! The Galaxy Tab comes with the Movie Studio app, which 
you can use to craft your own epic productions. You can mix in still images 
and videos you’ve already shot (which are stored in the Gallery app), or you 
can shoot new footage right from within the Movie Studio app itself.
Figure 15-5 illustrates the Movie Studio app’s main screen.
The Movie Studio app is actually quite sophisticated for a tablet. Aside from 
stitching together video and still images, there are filters you can add (called 
Effects in the program), text overlays, and transitions between shots. You 
can even add in music tracks and other audio. It’s pretty impressive.
	
✓	Touch the Menu icon button and choose Export Movie to save your 
project.
	
✓	Touch the Add Music button (refer to Figure 15-5) to pluck out an audio 
track from the Music app, or from any other music-like app on the 
Galaxy Tab. 
	
✓	See Chapter 11 for information on using your Galaxy Tab as both a still 
and video camera. Chapter 12 covers the Gallery, where images and 
videos are stored.

It’s Your Game Machine
One of the best ways to put expensive, high-tech gizmos to work is to play 
games. Don’t even sweat the thought that you have too much “business” 
or “work” or other important stuff you can do on a Galaxy Tab. The more 
advanced the mind, the more the need for play, right? So indulge yourself.
Lamentably, there are no sample games that ship with the Galaxy Tab. That 
may change in the future, but for now you’re left to hunt down games at the 
Market just like everyone else in the Android Kingdom.

212
Part III: The Everything Tab 
Just to be a tease, Figure 15-6 shows a game on the Galaxy Tab. It’s one of 
many, so don’t think I’m recommending anything, though I did play Jet Car 
Stunts on my Galaxy Tab for hours on end during an intercontinental flight.

W

ithout apps, your Galaxy Tab would be nothing more than a pricey 
frame without a picture. There must be apps!
A moderate assortment of apps was preinstalled by Samsung, and 
perhaps another few apps were installed by your cellular pro­
vider. Beyond that, you can add more apps to your Tab, 
which extends the list of things you can do in the mobile 
universe. Adding new apps and managing all your 
Tab’s apps are the topics of this chapter.
Welcome to the Market
People love to shop when they’re buying something 
they want or when they’re spending someone else’s 
money. You can go shopping for your Galaxy Tab, 
and I’m not talking about going back to your local 
Phone Store to buy overpriced accessories. I’m talking 
about software, programs, applications — or just plain 
old apps.

214
Part III: The Everything Tab 
The Android Market may sound like the place where you can go buy an R2-D2 
or a Robby the Robot. Instead, it’s an online place where you go to pick up 
new apps, buy books, and rent movies for your Galaxy Tab. You can browse, 
you can get free apps or books, or you can pay. It all happens at the Android 
Market.
	
✓	Officially, the Android Market is called the Market. The name of the app 
is Market. I still like to call it the Android Market.
	
✓	App is short for application. It’s a program, or software, you can add to 
your Galaxy Tab to make it do new, wondrous, or useful things.
	
✓	Because the Galaxy Tab uses the Android operating system, it can run 
nearly all applications written for Android.
	
✓	You can be assured that all apps that appear in the Android Market can 
be used with the Galaxy Tab. There’s no way to download or buy some­
thing that’s incompatible with your Tab.
	
✓	All apps you download can be found on the Apps Menu screen. Further, 
apps you download have shortcut icons placed on the Home screen. See 
Chapter 20 for information on moving apps on the Home screen.
	
✓	You obtain items from the Market by downloading them into your Tab. 
That file transfer works best at top speeds; therefore:
	
✓	I highly recommend that you connect your cellular Tab to a Wi-Fi net­
work if you plan to obtain apps, books, or movies at the Android Market. 
Not only does Wi-Fi give you speed, but it also helps avoid data sur­
charges. See Chapter 17 for details on connecting the Galaxy Tab to a 
Wi-Fi network.
	
✓	The Market app is frequently updated, so its look may change from what 
you see in this chapter. They may also add a Music category in the near 
future. Updated information on the Market is available on my website:
www.wambooli.com/help/galaxytab
Browsing the Android Market
You access the Android Market by opening the Market app, found on the 
Apps Menu screen but also on the main Home screen.
After opening the Market app, you see the main screen, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 16-1. You can browse for apps, games, books, or movie 
rentals. The categories are listed on the top-left part of the screen, with the 
other parts of the screen highlighting popular or recommended items. Those 

215
 Chapter 16: A Galaxy of Apps
recommendations are color-coded to let you know what they are: green for 
apps, blue for books, and red for video rentals.
Go to the Market’s main screen
Top level categories

Figure 16-1: The Android Market.
Find items by choosing a category from the top of the screen. (Refer to 
Figure 16-1.) The next screen lists popular and featured items plus categories 
you can browse by swiping the screen right to left. The category titles appear 
toward the top of the screen.
	
When you have an idea of what you want, such as an app’s name or even 
what it does, searching works fastest: Touch the Search Market button at 
the top of the Market screen. (Refer to Figure 16-1.) Type all or part of the 
app’s name, the book or movie title, or perhaps a description. Touch the 
keyboard’s Search or Go button to begin your search.
To see more information about an item, touch it. Touching something doesn’t 
buy it but instead displays a more detailed description, screen shots, a video 
preview, comments, plus links to similar items.
Return to the main Android Market screen at any time by touching the 
Market icon in the upper-left corner of the screen.

216
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
✓	The first time you enter the Android Market, you have to accept the 
terms of service; touch the Accept button.
	
✓	Pay attention to an app’s ratings. Ratings are added by people who use 
the apps — people like you and me. Having more stars is better. You can 
see additional information, including individual user reviews, by choos­
ing the app.
	
✓	Another good indicator of an app’s success is how many times it’s been 
downloaded. Some apps have been downloaded over ten million times. 
That’s a good sign.
	
✓	Apps you download are added to the Apps Menu, made available like 
any other app on your Tab. They also appear as Home screen shortcut 
icons.
	
✓	In addition to getting apps, you can download widgets for the Home 
screen as well as wallpapers for the Galaxy Tab. Just search the Market 
for widget or live wallpaper.
	
✓	See Chapter 20 for more information on widgets and live wallpapers.
	
✓	Books and videos you get from the Market are viewed using the Books 
and Videos apps, respectively. See Chapter 14 for information on Google 
Books; Chapter 15 for information on videos.
Getting a free app
After you locate an app you want, the next step is to download it. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	If possible, activate the Wi-Fi connection to avoid incurring data 
overages.
	
	 See Chapter 17 for information on connecting your Galaxy Tab to a Wi-Fi 
network.
	
2.	Open the Market app.
	
3.	Locate the app you want and open its description.
	
	 You can browse for apps or use the Search button to find an app by 
name or what it does.
	
4.	Touch the Install button.
	
	 Free apps feature an Install button. Paid apps have a button with 
the app’s price on it. (See the next section for information on buying 
an app.)

217
 Chapter 16: A Galaxy of Apps
	
	 After touching the Install button, you’re alerted to any services that the 
app uses. The list of permissions isn’t a warning, and it doesn’t mean 
anything bad. It’s just that the Market is telling you which of your Tab’s 
features the app uses.
	
5.	Touch the OK button to accept the conditions and begin the download.
	
6.	Touch the Open button to run the app.
	
	
	 Or, if you were doing something else while the app was downloading and 
installing, choose the Installed App notification, as shown in the margin. 
The notification features the app’s name with the text Successfully 
Installed beneath it.
At this point, what happens next depends on the app you’ve downloaded. 
For example, you may have to agree to a license agreement. If so, touch the I 
Agree button. Additional setup may involve setting your location, signing in 
to an account, or creating a profile, for example.
After you complete the initial setup, or if no setup is necessary, you can start 
using the app.
	
✓	Peruse the list of services an app uses (in Step 4) to look for anything 
unusual or out of line with the app’s purpose. For example, an alarm 
clock app that uses your contact list and the text messaging service 
would be a red flag, especially if it’s your understanding that the app 
doesn’t need to text message any of your contacts.
	
✓	Chapter 24 lists some Android apps that I recommend, all of which 
are free.
Buying an app
Some great free apps are available, but many of the apps you dearly want 
probably cost money. It’s not a lot of money, especially compared with the 
price of computer software. In fact, it seems odd to sit and stew over whether 
paying 99 cents for a game is “worth it.”
	
I recommend that you download a free app first to familiarize yourself with 
the process.
When you’re ready to pay for an app, follow these steps:
	
1.	Activate the Galaxy Tab’s Wi-Fi connection.
	
2.	Open the Market app.

218
Part III: The Everything Tab 
	
3.	Browse or search for the app you want and then choose the app to dis­
play its description.
	
	 Review the app’s price.
	
4.	Touch the Buy button.
	
	 That app’s price is listed above the button.
	
	 The next window, titled Purchase & Allow Access, displays the 
services the app uses, such as Storage to keep high scores or other 
data, Networking Communication to access the Internet, and so on.
	
5.	Choose your credit card.
	
	 The credit card information is at the top of the Purchase & Allow Access 
window, on the right. The card must be on file with Google Checkout. 
If you don’t yet have a card on file, choose the option Add Payment 
Method. Choose Add Card and then fill in the fields on the Credit Card 
screen to add your payment method to Google Checkout.
	
6.	Touch the OK button.
	
	 Your payment method is authorized, and the app is downloaded and 
installed.
The app can be accessed from the Apps Menu, just like all other apps avail­
able on your Galaxy Tab. Or if you’re still at the app’s screen in the Market, 
touch the Open button.
Eventually, you receive an e-mail message from the Android Market, confirm­
ing your purchase. The message contains a link you can click to review the 
refund policy should you change your mind on the purchase.
Be quick on that refund: Some apps allow you only 15 minutes to get your 
money back. Otherwise, the standard refund period is 24 hours. You know 
when the time is up because the Refund button changes its name to Uninstall.
Also see the section “Removing downloaded apps,” later in this chapter.
Never buy an app twice
Any apps you’ve already purchased in the 
Android Market, say for an Android phone or 
other mobile device, are available for download 
on your Galaxy Tab at no charge. Simply find the 
app and touch the Install button.
You can review any already-purchased apps in 
the Market: Choose My Apps from the top of the 
screen. At the bottom of the list of apps, under 
the heading Not Installed, you find any apps 
you’ve already purchased at the Market.

219
 Chapter 16: A Galaxy of Apps
App Management 101
The Market is not only where you buy apps — it’s also the place you return 
to for performing app management. That task includes reviewing apps you’ve 
downloaded, updating apps, organizing apps, and removing apps you no 
longer want or that you severely hate.
Reviewing your apps
To peruse the apps you’ve downloaded from the Android Market, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Start the Market app.
	
2.	Choose My Apps from the top of the screen.
	
3.	Scroll your downloaded apps.
The list of downloaded apps should look similar to the one shown in Figure 16-2. 
Instantly, you can see any apps that are in need of an update, as shown in 
the figure.

Part III: The Everything Tab 
Touch an app to see details about the app, such as the details for the AK 
Notepad shown in Figure 16-2. You can touch the See Details button to read 
more about the app, though the most handy thing to do is to use the Open 
button to run the app.
You can place a check mark by the option Allow Automatic Updating, which 
assists in keeping your apps current. Also, there’s that Uninstall button, 
which removes the app from your Tab. Later sections in this chapter 
describe the details on updating and uninstalling apps.
	
✓	The list of installed apps shows all the apps you’ve downloaded on your 
Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	Some apps on the My Apps screen might not be installed on your 
Galaxy Tab. For example, they could have been downloaded and then 
removed. They appear at the bottom of the app list under the heading 
Not Installed.
	
✓	Uninstalled apps remain on the My Apps list because you did, at one 
time, download the app. To reinstall them (and without paying a second 
time for paid apps), choose the app from the Not Installed list.
Sharing an app
When you love an app so much that you just can’t contain your glee, feel free 
to share that app with your friends. You can easily share a link to the app in 
the Market by obeying these steps:
	
1.	View the My Apps list.
	
	 Refer to the preceding section. Actually, the app doesn’t have to be on 
your list of downloaded apps; you can share any app in the Market.
	
2.	Choose the app from the list to display information about the app.
	
	 For example, in Figure 16-2, information about the AK Notepad is 
displayed.
	
3.	Touch the See Details button.
	
	
4.	Touch the Share button.
	
	
	 A menu appears listing various apps and methods for sharing the app’s 
Market link with your pals.
	
5.	Choose a sharing method.
	
	 For example, choose Gmail to send a link to the app in an e-mail message.

221
 Chapter 16: A Galaxy of Apps
	
6.	Use the chosen app to send the link.
	
	 What happens next depends on which sharing method you’ve chosen.
The end result of these steps is that your friend receives a link. They can 
touch that link on their phone, or other mobile Android device, and be 
whisked instantly to the Market, where they can view the app and easily 
install it.
Methods for using the various items on the Share menu are found throughout 
this book.
Updating an app
One nice thing about using the Android Market to get new software is that 
the market also notifies you of new versions of the programs you download. 
Whenever a new version of any app is available, you see it flagged for updat­
ing, as shown in Figure 16-2. Updating the app to get the latest version is 
cinchy.
From the My Apps list (refer to Figure 16-2), touch the Update button to 
update all the apps for which automatic updating is allowed.
Some apps must be updated individually. To do so, touch the app in the 
Update part of the My Apps list. Then touch the Update button (also shown 
in Figure 16-2) to manually update the app.
	
To make updating easier, you can place a green check mark by the item Allow 
Automatic Updating. Refer to Figure 16-2 for that check mark box’s location.
	
✓	The updating process often involves downloading and installing a new 
version of the app. That’s perfectly fine; your settings and options aren’t 
changed by the update process.
	
	
✓	Update to apps might also be indicated by the Updates Available notifi­
cation icon, shown in the margin as well as in Figure 16-1. Choose the 
Updates Available notification to be instantly whisked to the My Apps 
screen, where you can update your apps as described in this section.
Removing downloaded apps
I can think of a few reasons to remove an app. It’s with eager relish that I 
remove apps that don’t work or somehow annoy me. It’s also perfectly okay 
to remove redundant apps, such as when you have multiple eBook readers 

222
Part III: The Everything Tab 
that you don’t use. And if you’re desperate for an excuse, removing apps 
frees up a modicum of storage in the Galaxy Tab’s internal storage area.
Whatever the reason, remove an app by following these directions:
	
1.	Start the Market app.
	
2.	Choose My Apps from the top of the screen.
	
3.	Touch the app that offends you.
	
4.	Touch the Uninstall button.
	
	 The app is removed.
The app continues to appear on the Downloads list even after it’s been 
removed. After all, you downloaded it once. That doesn’t mean that the app 
is installed.
	
✓	In most cases, if you uninstall a paid app right away, your credit card or 
account is fully refunded. The definition of “right away” depends on the 
app and is stated on the app’s description screen. It could be anywhere 
from 15 minutes to 24 hours.
	
✓	You can always reinstall paid apps that you’ve uninstalled. You aren’t 
charged twice for doing so.
	
✓	You can’t remove apps that are preinstalled on the Tab by either 
Samsung or your cellular service provider. I’m sure there’s probably 
a technical way to uninstall the apps, but seriously: Just don’t use the 
apps if you want to remove them and discover that you can’t.

Nuts & Bolts

here’s a lot you can do with your Galaxy Tab 
that doesn’t qualify as communications or a 
whatever-else it can do. Yes, those things are 
impressive, but there’s more to the Tab than just 
being the ultimate gizmo.
For example, you can connect the Tab to a wire­
less network or a computer. You can customize 
the Tab. You can perform maintenance and config­
uration settings. None of those things have the 
glamour of, say, video chat, but they’re necessary, 
important, and covered in this part of the book.

hat exactly is portable? Back in the olden days, the boys in Marketing 
would say that bolting a handle to just about anything made it por­
table. Even a rhinoceros would be portable if he had a handle. Well, and the 
legs, they kind of make the rhino portable, I suppose. But my point 
is that to be portable requires more than just a handle; it 
requires a complete lack of wires.
The Galaxy Tab’s battery keeps it away from a wall 
socket. The digital cellular signal keeps your gizmo 
away from a phone line. Other types of wireless 
communications are available to the Tab, including 
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Both of those features ensure 
the Tab’s portability, and they’re both covered in 
this chapter.
Wireless Networking Wizardry
You know that wireless networking has hit the big-time 
when you see people asking Santa Claus for a wireless router 
at Christmas. Such a thing would have been unheard of years ago 
because routers were used primarily for woodworking back then. Today, 
wireless networking is what keeps gizmos like the Galaxy Tab connected to 
the Internet.

226
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
The primary reason for wireless networking on the Galaxy Tab is to connect 
to the Internet. For exchanging and synchronizing files, refer to Chapter 18.
Using the cellular data network
The cellular Galaxy Tab is designed to connect to the Internet by using the 
digital cellular network. This signal is the same type used by cell phones and 
cellular modems to wirelessly connect to the Internet.
Several types of digital cellular networks are available:
4G LTE: The fourth generation of wide-area data network is as much as 
ten times faster than the 3G network and is the latest craze in cellular 
networking. Verizon is busily covering the country in a coat of 4G LTE 
paint; if the signal isn’t available in your area now, it will be soon.
3G: The third generation of wide-area data networks is several times 
faster than the previous generation of data networks. This type of wire­
less signal is the most popular in the United States.
1X: There are several types of original, slower cellular data signals avail­
able. They all fall under the 1X banner. It’s slow.
Your Galaxy Tab always uses the best network available. So, if the 4G LTE 
network is within reach, that network is used for Internet communications. 
Otherwise, the 3G network is chosen.
	
✓	A notification icon for the type of network being used appears in the 
status area, right next to the Signal Strength icon.
	
✓	Accessing the digital cellular network isn’t free. Your Galaxy Tab most 
likely has some form of subscription plan for a certain quantity of data. 
When you exceed that quantity, the costs can become prohibitive.
	
✓	See Chapter 19 for information on how to avoid cellular data over­
charges when taking your Galaxy Tab out and about.
	
✓	A better way to connect your Galaxy Tab to the Internet is to use the 
Wi-Fi signal, covered in the next section. The digital cellular network 
signal makes for a great fallback because it’s available in more places 
than Wi-Fi is.
	
✓	Wi-Fi–only Galaxy Tabs can’t access the digital cellular network.
Understanding Wi-Fi
The digital cellular connection is nice, and it’s available pretty much all over, 
but it will cost you moolah. A better option, and one you should seek out 

227
 Chapter 17: It’s a Wireless Life
when it’s available, is Wi-Fi, or the same wireless networking standard used 
by computers for communicating with each other and the Internet.
To make Wi-Fi work on the Galaxy Tab requires two steps. First, you must 
activate Wi-Fi, by turning on the Tab’s wireless radio. The second step, cov­
ered in the following section, is connecting to a specific wireless network.
	
Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity. It’s also known by various famous numbers, 
including 802.11g and 802.11n.
Activating and deactivating Wi-Fi
Follow these carefully written directions to activate Wi-Fi networking on your 
Galaxy Tab:
	
1.	Touch the Apps Menu button.
	
2.	Open the Settings app.
	
3.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
4.	Touch the square by Wi-Fi to place a green check mark by that option.
The Tab’s Wi-Fi radio is activated. If you’ve already configured your Tab 
to connect to an available wireless network, it’s connected automatically. 
Otherwise, you have to connect to an available network, which is covered in 
the next section.
To turn off Wi-Fi, repeat the steps in this section. Turning off Wi-Fi discon­
nects the Tab from any wireless networks.
	
✓	From the And-Now-He-Tells-Us Department, you can quickly get to the 
Wi-Fi Settings window from the Quick Settings screen. See Chapter 3 for 
more information on the Quick Settings screen.
	
✓	If you place a check mark by the option Network Notification on the 
Wi-Fi Settings window, the Tab alerts you to the presence of available 
Wi-Fi networks whenever you’re in range and not connected to a net­
work. This option is a good one to have set when you’re frequently on 
the road. That’s because:
	
✓	Using Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet doesn’t incur data usage charges.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab Wi-Fi radio places an extra drain on the battery, but 
it’s truly negligible. If you want to save a modicum of juice, especially if 
you’re out and about and don’t plan to be near a Wi-Fi access point for 
any length of time, turn off the Wi-Fi radio as described in this section.

228
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Connecting to a Wi-Fi network
After you’ve activated the Galaxy Tab’s Wi-Fi radio, you can connect to an 
available wireless network. Heed these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Apps Menu button on the Home screen.
	
2.	Open the Settings app.
	
3.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
4.	Choose Wi-Fi Settings.
	
5.	Ensure that Wi-Fi is on.
	
	 When you see a green check mark next to the Wi-Fi option, Wi-Fi is on.
	
6.	Choose a wireless network from the list.
	
	 Available Wi-Fi networks appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 17-1. When no wireless networks are listed, you’re sort of out of 
luck regarding wireless access from your current location.

7.	Optionally, type the network password.
	
	 Touch the Password text box to see the onscreen keyboard.
	
	 Touch the Show Password check box so that you can see what you’re 
typing; some of those network passwords can be long.
	
8.	Touch the Connect button.
	
	 You should be immediately connected to the network. If not, try the 
password again.
	
	 When the Galaxy Tab is connected to a wireless network, you see the Wi-Fi 
status icon, shown in the margin. This icon replaces the cellular data signal 
icon. It means that the Tab’s Wi-Fi is on, connected, and communicating with 
a Wi-Fi network.
Some wireless networks don’t broadcast their names, which adds security 
but also makes connecting more difficult. In those cases, choose the com­
mand Add Wi-Fi Network (refer to Figure 17-1) to manually add the network. 
You need to type the network name, or SSID, and choose the type of security. 
You also need the password if one is used. You can obtain this information 
from the girl with the pink hair who sold you coffee or from whomever is in 
charge of the wireless network at your location.
	
✓	Not every wireless network has a password.
	
✓	Some public networks are open to anyone, but you have to use the 
Browser app to find a login page that lets you access the network: 
Simply browse to any page on the Internet, and the login page shows up.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab automatically remembers every Wi-Fi network it has 
ever been connected to and automatically reconnects upon finding the 
same network again.
	
✓	To disconnect from a Wi-Fi network, simply turn off Wi-Fi. See the pre­
ceding section.
	
✓	Unlike a cellular data network, a Wi-Fi network’s broadcast signal goes 
only so far. My advice is to use Wi-Fi whenever you plan to remain in 
one location for a while. If you wander too far away, your Tab loses the 
signal and is disconnected.
A Connection Shared
Your Galaxy Tab has no trouble sniffing out a digital cellular signal, so it can 
access the Internet just about anywhere. Your laptop might not be so lucky. 
But hey: You’re already paying for the digital cellular signal, right? So why 

230
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
should you bother getting a digital cellular modem for the laptop, as well as 
buying into another cellular contract, when you could just use the Galaxy 
Tab as a portable modem?
Sharing the Galaxy Tab’s Internet connection is not only possible, but also 
relatively easy. You can go about sharing in one of two ways: The wireless 
way is to create a mobile hotspot; the wired way is to use the tethering tech­
nique. Both methods are covered in this section.
Creating a mobile hotspot
You can direct the Galaxy Tab to share its digital cellular connection with as 
many as five other wireless gizmos. This process is referred to as creating a 
mobile, wireless hotspot, though no heat or fire is involved.
To set up a mobile hotspot with your Galaxy Tab, heed these steps:
	
1.	Turn off the Galaxy Tab’s Wi-Fi radio.
	
	 You can’t be using a Wi-Fi connection when you create a Wi-Fi hotspot. 
Actually, the notion is kind of silly: If the Galaxy Tab can get a Wi-Fi 
signal, other gizmos can too, so why bother creating a Wi-Fi hotspot in 
the first place?
	
	 See the earlier section, “Activating and deactivating Wi-Fi,” for informa­
tion on disabling Wi-Fi on your Galaxy Tab.
	
2.	If you can, plug in the Galaxy Tab.
	
	 It’s okay if you don’t find a power outlet, but running a mobile hotspot 
draws a lot of power. The Tab’s battery power drains quickly if you can’t 
plug in.
	
3.	From the Apps screen, open the Settings app.
	
	 Touch the Apps Menu button to get to the Apps screen.
	
4.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
5.	Choose Tethering & Portable Hotspot.
	
	 The Tethering & Portable Hotspot window appears.
	
6.	Touch the box to place a green check mark by Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot.
	
	 Yep, that’s about all there is to it.
	
	 When the hotspot is activated, you see the Tethering or Hotspot Active status 
icon displayed, as shown in the margin. You can continue to use the Galaxy 
Tab while it’s sharing the digital cellular connection, but other devices can 
now use their Wi-Fi radio to access your Tab’s shared connection.

231
 Chapter 17: It’s a Wireless Life
To turn off the mobile hotspot, choose the Tethering or Mobile Hotspot 
Active notification and remove the green check mark by Portable Wi-Fi 
Hotspot.
	
✓	One of the easiest ways to disable the Wi-Fi radio is to use the Quick 
Settings. See Chapter 3 for more information on Quick Settings.
	
✓	You can change the mobile hotspot configuration by choosing the 
Configure Wi-Fi Hotspot command in the Tethering & Portable Hotspot 
window. Use the Configure Wi-Fi Hotspot dialog box to change the Wi-Fi 
network name (SSID) and set security (add a password), if you like.
	
✓	The range for the mobile hotspot is about 30 feet.
	
✓	Some cellular providers may not allow you to create a mobile hotspot, 
and of course, you cannot create a mobile hotspot when your Galaxy 
Tab doesn’t use the cellular data network.
	
✓	Don’t forget to turn off the mobile hotspot when you’re done using it. 
Those data rates can certainly add up!
Sharing the Internet via tethering
Another, more personal way to share your Galaxy Tab’s digital cellular con­
nection, and to get one other device on the Internet, is tethering. This opera­
tion is carried out by connecting the Tab to another gizmo, such as a laptop 
computer, via its USB cable. Then you activate USB tethering, and the other 
gizmo is suddenly using the Galaxy Tab like a modem.
To set up tethering on your Galaxy Tab, heed these directions:
	
1.	Turn off the Tab’s Wi-Fi radio.
	
	 You cannot share a connection with the Wi-Fi radio on; you can share 
only the digital cellular connection.
	
2.	Connect the Tab to a PC using its USB cable.
	
	 Specifically, the PC must be running Windows 7 or Windows Vista or 
some flavor of the Linux operating system.
	
3.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu button.
	
4.	Open the Settings app.
	
5.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
6.	Choose Tethering & Portable Hotspot.

232
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
	
7.	Place a green check mark by the option USB Tethering.
	
	 The option is disabled when you’re using a Wi-Fi connection, which 
means that you ignored Step 1, or when the Galaxy Tab isn’t connected 
to a PC via the USB cable, which means that you ignored Step 2.
	
8.	On the PC, choose Public when prompted to specify the type of net­
work to which you’ve just connected.
	
	 Though the Galaxy Tab’s digital cellular network is being shared, you see the 
Tethering Active notification, shown in the margin. You can choose that noti­
fication to turn off tethering: Simply remove the check mark by the USB 
Tethering option.
	
✓	Sharing the digital network connection incurs data usage charges 
against your cellular data plan. Be careful with your data usage when 
you’re sharing a connection.
	
✓	You may be prompted on the PC to locate and install software for 
the Galaxy Tab. Do so: Accept the installation of new software when 
prompted by Windows.
The Bluetooth Experience
Computer nerds have long had the desire to connect high-tech gizmos to one 
another. The Bluetooth standard was developed to sate this desire in a wire­
less way. Though Bluetooth is wireless communication, it’s not the same as 
wireless networking. It’s more about connecting peripheral devices, such as 
keyboards, mice, printers, headphones, and other gear. It all happens in a 
wireless way, as described in this section.
Understanding Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a peculiar name for a wireless communications standard. Unlike 
Wi-Fi networking, with Bluetooth you simply connect two gizmos. Here’s how 
the operation works:
	
1.	Turn on the Bluetooth wireless radio on each gizmo.
	
	 There are two Bluetooth gizmos: the peripheral and the main device to 
which you’re connecting the gizmo, such as the Galaxy Tab.
	
2.	Make the gizmo you’re trying to connect to discoverable.
	
	 By making a device discoverable, you’re telling it to send a signal to 
other Bluetooth gizmos, saying, “Here I am!”

233
 Chapter 17: It’s a Wireless Life
	
3.	On the Galaxy Tab, choose the peripheral gizmo from the list of 
Bluetooth devices.
	
	 This action is known as pairing the devices.
	
4.	Optionally, confirm the connection on the peripheral device.
	
	 For example, you may be asked to input a code or press a button.
	
5.	Use the device.
	
	 What you can do with the device depends on what it does.
When you’re done using the device, you simply turn it off. Because the Bluetooth 
gizmo is paired with the Galaxy Tab, it’s automatically reconnected the next time 
you turn it on (that is, if you have Bluetooth activated on the Tab).
	
	 Bluetooth devices are marked with the Bluetooth icon, shown in the margin. 
It’s your assurance that the gizmo can work with other Bluetooth devices.
	
Bluetooth was developed as a wireless version of the old RS-232 standard, 
the serial port on early personal computers. Essentially, Bluetooth is wireless 
RS-232, and the variety of devices you can connect to and the things you can 
do with Bluetooth are similar to what you could do with the old serial port 
standard.
Activating Bluetooth
To make the Bluetooth connection, you turn on the Galaxy Tab’s Bluetooth 
radio. Obey these directions:
	
1.	On the Apps screen, open the Settings icon.
	
2.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
3.	Place a green check mark by the Bluetooth option.
	
	 When Bluetooth is on, the Bluetooth status icon appears, as shown in the 
margin.
To turn off Bluetooth, repeat the steps in this section: Remove the check 
mark in Step 3.
Connecting to a Bluetooth device
To make the Bluetooth connection between the Galaxy Tab and some other 
gizmo, follow these steps:

234
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
	
1.	Ensure that Bluetooth is on.
	
	 Refer to the preceding section.
	
2.	Turn on the Bluetooth gizmo or ensure that its Bluetooth radio is on.
	
	 Some Bluetooth devices have separate power and Bluetooth switches.
	
3.	On the Galaxy Tab, touch the Apps Menu button on the Home screen 
and run the Settings app.
	
4.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
5.	Choose Bluetooth Settings.
	
	 The Bluetooth Settings window appears.
	
6.	If the other device has an option to become visible, select it.
	
	 For example, some Bluetooth gizmos have a tiny button to press that 
makes the device visible to other Bluetooth gizmos. (You don’t need 
to make the Galaxy Tab visible unless you’re accessing it from another 
Bluetooth gizmo.)
	
7.	Choose Find Nearby Devices.
	
	 Eventually, the device should appear on the Bluetooth Settings window, 
as shown in Figure 17-2.
Keyboard
Computer
Printer
Available Bluetooth gizmos
Figure 17-2: Finding Bluetooth gizmos.
	
8.	Choose the device.

235
 Chapter 17: It’s a Wireless Life
	
9.	If necessary, input the device’s passcode or otherwise acknowledge 
the connection.
	
	 Not every device has a passcode. If prompted, acknowledge the pass­
code on either the Galaxy Tab or the other device.
After you acknowledge the passcode (or not), the Bluetooth gizmo and your 
Galaxy Tab are connected and communicating. You can begin using the 
device.
Connected devices appear on the Bluetooth Settings window, at the bottom 
under the heading Paired Devices.
To break the connection, you can either turn off the gizmo or disable the 
Bluetooth radio on your Galaxy Tab. Because the devices are paired, when 
you turn on Bluetooth and reactivate the device, the connection is instantly 
reestablished.
	
✓	How you use the device depends on what it does. For example, the 
keyboard in Figure 17-2 can be used for text input, the computer can be 
accessed for sharing files, and the printer can be used for printing docu­
ments or pictures, which is covered in the next section.
	
✓	You can unpair a device by choosing it from the Bluetooth Settings 
window. Choose the Unpair command to break the Bluetooth connec­
tion and stop using the device.
	
✓	Only unpair devices you don’t plan on using again in the future. 
Otherwise, simply turn off the Bluetooth device. 
	
✓	Bluetooth can use a lot of power. Especially for battery-powered devices, 
don’t forget to turn them off when you’re no longer using them with the 
Galaxy Tab.
Printing to a Bluetooth printer
Perhaps the only, and most crazy, way to print something on your Galaxy 
Tab is to connect to a Bluetooth printer and upload a document or image for 
printing. It’s not an obvious thing to do, and Bluetooth printers are kind of 
rare. Still, it works, and reading this section helps make it work.
Before you can print, ensure that your Galaxy Tab is paired with the Bluetooth 
printer. You may have to make the printer discoverable, and then you need 
to choose it from the list of devices, as shown in Figure 17-2. You may also 
have to type the printer’s PIN into the Galaxy Tab; the PIN should be dis­
played on the printer’s screen or available in its documentation. (My printer 
uses the PIN code 0000.)

236
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
When the printer and the Bluetooth printer are properly paired, you see the 
printer listed under Bluetooth Devices on the Bluetooth Settings screen. Even 
if it says “Paired but not connected,” you’re ready to go.
Assuming that the Bluetooth printer is on and ready to print, obey these 
steps to print something on your Galaxy Tab:
	
1.	View the document, web page, or image you want to print.
	
2.	Choose the Share command.
	
	 If a Share button isn’t visible in the app, press the Menu button to look 
for the Share command.
	
3.	Choose Bluetooth from either the Share or Share Via menu.
	
4.	Choose your Bluetooth printer from the list of items on the Bluetooth 
Device Picker screen.
	
5.	If a prompt appears on the printer, confirm that the Galaxy Tab is 
printing a document.
	
	 The document is uploaded (sent from the Tab to the printer), and then it 
prints. You can view the uploading status by checking the notifications 
in the lower-right corner of the screen.
Not everything on your Galaxy Tab can be printed on a Bluetooth printer. 
When you can’t find the Share command or the Bluetooth item isn’t available 
on the Share menu, you can’t print using Bluetooth.
	
Bluetooth printers sport the Bluetooth logo somewhere.

T

he Galaxy Tab is adept at communicating wirelessly. It can connect to 
the Internet using the digital cellular signal or over a Wi-Fi connection. 
Beyond that, you can use the USB cable to connect your Tab to another 
gizmo. No, you cannot use the USB cable to connect the Galaxy 
Tab to the couch, or the toaster, or the time machine. You 
can, however, use the USB cable to connect the Galaxy Tab 
to a computer. This chapter describes all the wonderful 
things that can happen after you make that connection.
The USB Connection
The most direct way to connect a Galaxy Tab to a 
computer is by using a wire — specifically, the wire 
nestled cozily in the heart of a USB cable. There are 
lots of things you can do after making the USB con­
nection. Before doing those things, you need to con­
nect the cable.
Yeah, it may seem excessive to write an entire section on 
what’s apparently a simple operation. But if you’ve used the Galaxy 
Tab and already tried to make a USB connection, you probably discovered 
that it’s not so simple.

238
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Connecting the Galaxy Tab to your PC
The USB connection between the Galaxy Tab and your computer works fast­
est when both devices are physically connected. You make this connection 
happen by using the USB cable that comes with the Tab. Like nearly every 
computer cable in the Third Dimension, the USB cable has two ends:
	
✓	The A end of the USB cable plugs into the computer.
	
✓	The other end of the cable plugs into the bottom of the Galaxy Tab.
The connectors are shaped differently and cannot be plugged in either 
backward or upside down. (The end that inserts into the Galaxy Tab has the 
SAMSUNG text facing you when you plug it in.)
After you understand how the cable works, plug the USB cable into one of the 
computer’s USB ports. Then plug the USB cable into the Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	As far as I can tell, you cannot connect the Galaxy Tab to a Macintosh 
and have it be recognized as an external storage device or media player.
	
✓	You can, however, use Bluetooth to send and receive files between the 
Galaxy Tab and a Mac. It’s not the fastest way to exchange information, 
but it works. See the later section, “Using Bluetooth to copy a file.”
	
✓	Even if you don’t use the USB cable to communicate with the computer, 
the Galaxy Tab’s battery charges when it’s connected to a computer’s 
USB port — as long as the computer is turned on, of course.
Dealing with the USB connection
Upon making the USB connection between the Galaxy Tab and a PC, a 
number of things happen. Don’t let any of these things cause you undue 
alarm.
First, you may see the MTP application screen appear on the Galaxy Tab. 
That screen indicates that the Tab is actively looking for the Samsung Kies 
program, which it can use to automatically synchronize information between 
the Tab and your PC.
Second, you may see some activity on the PC, some drivers being installed 
and such. That’s normal behavior any time you first connect a new USB 
gizmo to a Windows computer.
Third, you may witness the AutoPlay dialog box. That dialog box helps you 
deal with the Galaxy Tab connection, to transfer music, pictures, files, and 
so on.

239
 Chapter 18: Connect and Share
Choose an option from the AutoPlay dialog box, such as Sync Digital Media 
Files to This Device. From that point on, you’ll use Windows or a program on 
your computer to work with the files on your Galaxy Tab.
Don’t be surprised if the AutoPlay dialog box doesn’t appear; many PCs are 
configured to ignore new gizmos. That’s okay: You can always manually 
summon the various options displayed in the AutoPlay dialog box, as dis­
cussed elsewhere in this chapter.
	
	 Fourth, the Galaxy Tab is added to your computer’s storage system. You see 
it listed as a device in the Computer window. On my PC, the Tab is assumed 
to be a portable music player; its icon is shown in the margin.
Bottom line: When you make the USB connection, you can exchange informa­
tion between your computer and the Galaxy Tab.
	
	
✓	When the Galaxy Tab is connected to a computer using the USB connec­
tion, the USB notification appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown 
in the margin. Choosing that notification does nothing.
	
	
✓	Unlike other Android devices you may be familiar with, there is no con­
figuration option for the USB connection. The Tab always connects as a 
portable media player.
	
✓	You can obtain a copy of the Samsung Kies program for your computer 
from the http:\\samsungapps.com website. I don’t specifically cover 
using Samsung Kies in this book. That’s because a lot of people dislike 
the program, and there are better ways to move files back and forth.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab icon in the Computer window may be named Galaxy 
Tab, or it could be given the device’s technical name, something delight­
fully cryptic like SCH-I905 or GT-P7510. 
	
✓	It’s actually the Galaxy Tab’s internal storage that’s mounted into your 
computer’s storage system.
	
✓	If you’re nerdy, you can open the Galaxy Tab’s icon in the Computer 
window. You see another window that lists the Tab’s storage, named 
Tablet. You can open that icon to browse files and folders on the Tab 
just as you can browse them on your computer. The later section, “Files 
from Here, Files to There,” describes how it works.
Disconnecting the Tab from your computer
This process is cinchy: When you’re done transferring files, music, or other 
media between your PC and the Tab, close all the programs and folders you 

240
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
have opened on the PC, specifically those you’ve used to work with the Tab’s 
storage. Then you can disconnect the USB cable. That’s it.
	
It’s a Bad Idea to unplug the Tab while you’re transferring information or 
while a folder window is open on the PC. Doing so could damage the Galaxy 
Tab’s internal storage, rendering some of the information kept there unread­
able. So just to be safe, close those programs and folder windows you’ve 
opened before disconnecting.
Files from Here, Files to There
The point of making the USB connection between your Galaxy Tab and the 
computer is to exchange files. You can’t just wish the files over. Instead, I rec­
ommend following the advice in this section, which also covers transferring 
files using Bluetooth.
	
A good understanding of basic file operations is necessary before you 
attempt file transfers between your computer and the Galaxy Tab. You need 
to know how to copy, move, rename, and delete files. It also helps to be famil­
iar with what folders are and how they work. The good news is that you don’t 
need to manually calculate a 64-bit cyclical redundancy check on the data, 
nor do you need to know what a parity bit is.
Transferring files to the Galaxy Tab
There are plenty of reasons you would want to copy a file from your com­
puter to the Galaxy Tab. You can copy over your pictures and videos, and 
you can copy over music or audio files. You can even copy vCards that you 
export from your e-mail program, which helps you build your Contacts list.
Follow these steps to copy a file from your computer to the Galaxy Tab:
	
1.	Connect the Galaxy Tab to the computer by using the USB cable.
	
	 Specific directions are offered earlier in this chapter.
	
2.	If the AutoPlay dialog box appears, choose the option Open Folder/
Device to View Files. Otherwise, open the Computer window, then 
open the Galaxy Tab’s icon, and then open the Tablet icon.
	
	 The AutoPlay dialog box is shown in Figure 18-1.
	
	 The folder window you see looks like any other folder in Windows. The 
difference is that the files and folders in that window are on the Galaxy 
Tab, not on your computer.

241
 Chapter 18: Connect and Share
Figure 18-1: The AutoPlay dialog box for the 
Galaxy Tab.
	
3.	Locate the files you want to copy to the Galaxy Tab.
	
	 Open the folder that contains the files, or somehow have the file icons 
visible on the screen.
	
4.	Drag the File icon from its folder on your computer to the Galaxy Tab 
window.
	
	 If you want to be specific, drag the file to the download folder; other­
wise, you can place the file into the Galaxy Tab’s root folder, as shown 
in Figure 18-2. Try to avoid dragging the file into other, specific folders, 
which would make the file more difficult to locate in the future.
	
5.	Close the folder windows and disconnect the USB cable when you’re 
done.
	
	 Refer to specific instructions earlier in this chapter.
Any files you’ve copied are now stored on the Galaxy Tab. What you do with 
them next depends on the reasons you copied the files: to view pictures, use 
the Gallery, import vCards, use the Contacts app, listen to music, or use the 
Music app, for example.

✓	The best way to move music and pictures over to your Galaxy Tab from 
the computer is to synchronize them. See the later section, “Synchronize 
with doubleTwist.”
	
✓	Also refer to Chapter 13 for information on synchronizing music using 
the Windows Media Player.
	
✓	The name of the cellular Galaxy Tab device is SCH-I905; the Wi-Fi version 
is GT-P7510. You may see those names when mounting the Tab into your 
computer’s storage system.
Copying files to your computer
After you’ve survived the ordeal of copying files from your computer to the 
Galaxy Tab, copying files in the other direction is a cinch: Follow the steps 
in the preceding section, but in Steps 3 and 4 you’re dragging the File icons 
from the Galaxy Tab folder window to your computer.
My advice is to drag the files to your computer’s desktop, unless you know of 
another location where you want the files copied.

243
 Chapter 18: Connect and Share
	
✓	Files you’ve downloaded on the Galaxy Tab are stored in the download 
folder.
	
✓	Pictures and videos on the Galaxy Tab are stored in the DCIM/Camera 
folder.
	
✓	Music on the Galaxy Tab is stored in the Music folder, organized by 
artist.
	
✓	Files transferred via Bluetooth are stored in the bluetooth folder. See 
the next section.
	
✓	Quite a few files can be found in the root folder, the main folder on the 
Galaxy Tab, which you see when the Tab is mounted into your comput­
er’s storage system and you open its folder.
Using Bluetooth to copy a file
Here’s a great way to give yourself a headache: Use the Bluetooth networking 
system to copy a file between your Galaxy Tab and a Bluetooth-enabled com­
puter. It’s slow and painful, but it works.
Get started by pairing the Galaxy Tab with the Bluetooth computer. See 
Chapter 17 for details on the whole pairing-discovery thing. When your Tab 
and computer are paired and connected, how the file transfer works depends 
on whether you’re using a PC or a Macintosh.
Send a file from the PC to the Galaxy Tab
On a PC, follow these steps to copy a file to the Galaxy Tab:
	
1.	Right-click the Bluetooth icon in the Notification Area.
	
	
	 The icon looks like the Bluetooth logo, shown in the margin. The 
Notification Area dwells on the far-right end of the taskbar.
	
	
2.	Choose Send a File from the pop-up menu.
	
3.	Choose the Galaxy Tab from the list of Bluetooth devices.
	
	 If you don’t see the Tab listed, ensure that the Bluetooth radio is on for 
both devices and that they’re paired.
	
4.	Click the Next button.
	
5.	Click the Browse button to locate files to send to the Tab.
	
6.	Use the Browse dialog box to locate and select one or more files.
	
7.	Click the Open button to choose the file(s).
	
8.	Click the Next button.

244
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
	
9.	On the Galaxy Tab, touch the Accept button to receive the file.
	
	 The Tab may play a notification alert, which lets you know that the file is 
coming over.
	
10.	On the PC, touch the Finish button.
	
	 The transfer is complete.
	
✓	Images sent to the Galaxy Tab from a PC can be found in the Gallery app, 
in the Bluetooth album.
	
✓	Not all PCs are equipped with Bluetooth. To add Bluetooth to a PC, you 
need a Bluetooth adapter. Inexpensive USB Bluetooth adapters are avail­
able at most computer and office supply stores.
Receive a file on a PC from the Galaxy Tab
To send a file from the Tab to a PC, you need to use the Bluetooth item found 
on the Share menu in various apps. Follow these steps:
	
1.	On the Galaxy Tab, locate the media or file you want to send to the PC.
	
2.	Choose the Share command.
	
3.	From the Share or Share Via menu, choose Bluetooth.
	
	 A list of Bluetooth devices appears.
	
4.	Choose the PC from the list.
	
5.	On the PC, click the Notification Area icon that appears, indicating 
that a Bluetooth file transfer request is pending.
	
6.	On the PC, click the OK button in the Access Authorization dialog box.
	
	 The file is sent to the PC.
On my PC, the received files are stored in the Bluetooth Exchange Folder, 
found in the Documents or My Documents folder.
Send a file from a Macintosh to the Tab
On a Macintosh, to copy a file to the Galaxy Tab by using Bluetooth, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Use the Bluetooth menu on the Mac to choose the Galaxy Tab and 
then Send File, as shown in Figure 18-3.
	
	 You can find the Bluetooth menu at the far-right end of the menu bar. 
The Galaxy Tab is probably named SCH-I905, which is Samsung’s super 
secret code name for the cellular Tab.

245
 Chapter 18: Connect and Share

2.	Use the Select File to Send dialog box to browse for the file you want 
to send from the Mac to the Galaxy Tab.
	
3.	On the Galaxy Tab, choose the Bluetooth notification.
	
4.	In the dialog box that appears on the Tab, touch the Accept button to 
receive the file.
Sadly, I cannot get the Mac to accept a file sent to it using the Bluetooth item 
from the Share menu. That method may work in the future, in which case the 
steps should work similar to those described in the earlier section, “Receive 
a file on a PC from the Galaxy Tab.”
Synchronize with doubleTwist
Perhaps the most effective and easy way to move information between the 
Galaxy Tab and your computer is to use a synchronization utility. One of 
the most popular is the free program doubleTwist, available at www.double
twist.com.
doubleTwist isn’t an Android app. You use it on your computer. It helps you 
synchronize picture, music, videos, and web page subscriptions between 
your computer and its media libraries and any portable device, such as the 
Galaxy Tab. Additionally, doubleTwist gives you the ability to search the 
Android Market and obtain new apps for your phone.

246
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
To use doubleTwist, connect the Galaxy Tab to your computer as described 
earlier in this chapter. Use the USB cable to make the PC-Tab connection.
If the doubleTwist program doesn’t start automatically after you connect the 
Tab, start it manually. The doubleTwist interface is illustrated in Figure 18-4.

To best use doubleTwist, place a check mark by the items you want to sync 
on the General tab. (Refer to Figure 18-4.) Or, you can choose a tab, such as 
Videos or Pictures, as shown in Figure 18-4, to select specific items to syn­
chronize. Click the Sync button to copy those files to the Galaxy Tab.
Another way to use doubleTwist is to copy media items to the Galaxy Tab 
by selecting and then dragging their icons. Choose a media category on your 
computer, as shown on the left side of the doubleTwist window in Figure 18-4. 
Drag media from your computer to the Galaxy Tab’s icon to copy over those 
files.
	
✓	doubleTwist doesn’t synchronize contact information.
	
✓	Some media organization programs on your computer, such as Windows 
Music Player or Windows Photo Gallery, may allow you to synchronize 
your media with the Galaxy Tab just as well as or perhaps better than 
doubleTwist.

The Galaxy Tab’s Internal Storage
Somewhere, deep in the bosom of your Galaxy Tab, there lies a storage 
device. It’s like the hard drive in your computer. The thing can’t be removed, 
but that’s not the point. The point is that the storage is used for your 
apps, music, videos, pictures, and a host of other information. This section 
describes what you can do to manage that storage.
	
✓	The Galaxy Tab comes with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage.
	
✓	A GB is a gigabyte, or one billion bytes (characters) of storage. A typical 
2-hour movie occupies about 4GB of storage, but most things you store 
on the Tab — music and pictures, for example — take up only a sliver of 
storage. Those items do, however, occupy more storage space the more 
you use your Tab.
Reviewing storage stats
You can see how much storage space is available on your Galaxy Tab’s inter­
nal storage by following these steps:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Open the Settings app and choose Storage.
	
	 You see a screen similar to Figure 18-5. It details information about stor­
age space on the Galaxy Tab’s internal storage.

Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
You can choose a category to see more information, or to launch a program. 
For example, touching the Misc. category (refer to Figure 18-5) displays a 
list of Misc. Files, including apps and files you’ve downloaded. Touching the 
Pictures, Videos category starts the Gallery app. 
	
✓	Things that consume the most storage space are videos, music, and pic­
tures, in that order.
	
✓	To see how much storage space is left, refer to the Available item.
	
✓	Don’t complain that the Total Space value is far less than the capacity 
of your Galaxy Tab. In Figure 18-5, it shows 27.89GB total space, even 
though the Galaxy Tab has 32GB of storage. The missing space is consid­
ered overhead, as are several gigabytes taken by the government for tax 
purposes.
Managing files
	
You probably didn’t get a Galaxy Tab because you enjoy managing files on 
a computer and wanted another gizmo to hone your skills. Even so, you can 
practice the same type of file manipulation on the Tab as you would on a 
computer. Is there a need to do so? Of course not! But if you want to get dirty 
with files, you can.
The main tool for managing files is the Quickoffice app. You may have seen 
that app used to display a Microsoft Office document download or file 
attachment. It can also be used to view PDF files. But when you choose the 
Quickoffice app from the Apps Menu, it opens as a sort of file manager, as 
shown in Figure 18-6.
Quickoffice can also be used to create new documents: Touch the New 
button, as shown in Figure 18-6. Further, it can synchronize with Google 
Docs, Dropbox, or a number of online file-sharing websites to help coordinate 
files you may store on the Internet. But for this section’s topic, it makes for a 
modest file-management app.
	
	
✓	Another file-management app I can recommend is ASTRO. Its QR code is 
shown in the margin. Scan that code to download a copy of ASTRO on 
your Tab, or just search for ASTRO in the Market, as discussed in 
Chapter 16.
	
✓	Some file-management apps may appear on various menus as you use 
the Tab. For example, if you choose an image, you may see a prompt 
asking you to select either the Gallery or the File Management app to 
view that image.
	
✓	If you simply want to peruse files you’ve downloaded from the Internet, 
open the Downloads app, found on the Apps Menu screen.

The HDMI Connection
Tired of that boring 10.1-inch screen on the Galaxy Tab? How large a screen 
do you want to have? The answer depends on how large of a television set is 
available. As long as the TV has an HDMI input, you can connect your Galaxy 
Tab to see the Big Picture.
To make the HDMI connection, you need the Multimedia Dock or HDMI 
dongle. Yep: The Tab doesn’t do HDMI straight out of the box. I’m sure the 
friendly folks at the Phone Store would be happy to sell you the proper HDMI 
equipment.
When you have that HDMI connection, plus an HDMI cable, you can hook up 
the Tab to an HDMI computer monitor or TV set. Simply plug the thing in. 
Both sound and video can be transferred from the Tab to the monitor (pro­
viding that the monitor is equipped with speakers).
Respond to the HDMI notification or pop-up and choose what information 
the external monitor should display and how you want it displayed. I choose 
the mirror option so that information displayed on the Tab is echoed on the 
HDMI screen. Then I can watch a movie or slide show and not have a crowd 
of people pressing against me. Welcome to the Big Screen.
I’ve played Angry Birds on a 52-inch plasma TV. It’s awesome.

▶	Taking the Tab on an airplane
▶	Using the Galaxy Tab overseas
▶	Avoiding those data roaming charges
L

ast time I checked, the Galaxy Tab didn’t come with legs. It doesn’t 
even have a rolling tread, like a tank. That would be nifty, and I’m sure 
that more Real Men would buy a Galaxy Tab with a tank tread, but it’s not 
my point: The Galaxy Tab is a mobile device. It’s wireless. It runs on battery 
power. You can take the Galaxy Tab with you everywhere you go and not get 
those peculiar looks you get when you take the washing machine with you.
How far can you go with the Galaxy Tab? As far as you want. 
As long as you can carry the Tab with you, it goes where 
you go. How it functions may change depending on your 
environment, and you can do a few things to prepare 
before you go, which are all covered in this chapter.
Before You Go
Unless the house is on fire, you should prepare sev­
eral things before leaving on a trip with your Galaxy 
Tab. First and most important, of course, is to charge 
the thing. I plug my Tab in overnight before I leave the 
next day.

252
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Another good thing to do is to synchronize media with your computer. This 
operation isn’t so much for taking media with you, but rather, it’s to ensure 
that you have a backup of the Tab’s media on your computer. See Chapter 18 
for synchronization information.
Consider getting some eBooks for the road. I prefer to sit and stew over the 
Kindle online library before I leave, as opposed to wandering aimlessly in 
some airport sundry store, trying hard to focus on the good books rather 
than on the salty snacks. Chapter 14 covers reading eBooks on your 
Galaxy Tab.
Another nifty thing to do is save some web pages for later reading. I usually 
start my day by perusing online articles and angry editorials in the local 
paper. Because I don’t have time to read that stuff before I leave, and I do 
have time on the plane, and I’m extremely unwilling to pay for in-flight Wi-Fi, I 
save my favorite websites for later reading. Here’s how to save a web page by 
using the Browser app:
	
1.	Navigate to the page you want to save for later reading.
	
2.	Touch the Menu icon button.
	
3.	Choose the Save Page command.
	
	 The page is downloaded, saved to the Tab’s internal storage.
Repeat these steps for each web page you want to read when offline.
To view the page, open the Downloads app on the Apps Menu. You see the 
web page listed, along with other items you’ve downloaded. Unfortunately, 
web pages are saved using the page’s original name, plus the long link name 
to that page. The name isn’t too cryptic, so even if you choose the wrong 
page from the Downloads list, you’re still reading a web page you’ve previ­
ously saved.
Downloaded web pages will be missing some information; only the text and 
formatting are saved; pictures might be missing. Though this arrangement 
may not look pretty, at least you’ll have some reading material on the 
plane — specifically, stuff you’re used to reading that day anyway.
	
✓	You can also download Google Books books using the Books app, 
though Kindle is my personal favorite.
	
✓	See Chapter 7 for more information on the Browser app and browsing 
the web on the Galaxy Tab.

 Chapter 19: Taking Your Tab with You
Galaxy Tab Travel Tips
I’m not a frequent flier, but I am a nerd. The most amount of junk I’ve carried 
with me on a flight is two laptop computers and three cell phones. I know 
that’s not a record, but it’s enough to warrant my list of travel tips, all of 
which apply to taking the Galaxy Tab with you on an extended journey:
	
✓	Take the Galaxy Tab’s AC adapter and USB cable with you. Put them in 
your carry-on luggage. Many airports feature USB chargers, so you can 
charge the Tab in an airport if you need to.
	
✓	At the security checkpoint, place your Galaxy Tab in a bin by itself or 
with other electronics.
	
✓	Use the Calendar app to keep track of your flights. The event title serves 
as the airline and flight number. For the event time, use the takeoff and 
landing schedules. For the location, list the origin and destination air­
port codes. And, in the Notes field, put the flight reservation number. If 
you’re using separate calendars (categories), specify the Travel calendar 
for your flight.
	
✓	See Chapter 15 for more information on the Calendar app.
	
✓	Some airlines feature Android apps you can use while traveling. At the 
time this book went to press, American Airlines, Southwest, United, 
Continental, and a host of other airlines feature apps. You can use the 
apps to not only keep track of flights but also to check in: Eventually, 
printed tickets will disappear, and you’ll merely show your “ticket” on 
the Galaxy Tab screen, which is then scanned at the gate.
	
✓	Some apps you can use to organize your travel details are similar to, but 
more sophisticated than, the Calendar app. Visit the Android Market 
and search for travel or airlines to find a host of apps.
Into the Wild Blue Yonder
It truly is the most trendy of things to be aloft with the latest mobile gizmo. 
Like taking a cell phone on a plane, however, you have to follow some rules. 
Though the Galaxy Tab isn’t a cell phone, you still have to heed the flight 
crew’s warnings regarding cell phones.
First and foremost, turn off the Galaxy Tab when instructed to do so. This 
direction is given before takeoff and landing, so be prepared.

254
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Before takeoff, you’ll most likely want to put the Tab into Airplane or Flight 
mode. Yep, it’s the same Airplane mode you see on a cell phone: The various 
scary and dangerous wireless radios on the Tab are disabled in that mode. 
With Airplane mode active, you’re free to use the Tab in-flight, and you can 
rest assured that with Airplane mode active, you face little risk of the Galaxy 
Tab causing the plane’s navigational equipment to fail and the entire flight to 
end as a fireball over Wyoming.
To enter Airplane mode on the Galaxy Tab, follow these steps just before 
takeoff:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the current time to pop up the list of 
notifications.
	
	
2.	Touch the Quick Settings button.
	
	
3.	Choose Airplane Mode to turn that option on.
	
	
	 On the Wi-Fi Tab, the option is titled Flight Mode. Same thing.
When the Galaxy Tab is in Airplane mode, a special icon appears by the cur­
rent time at the bottom right of the screen. You might also see the text No 
Internet Connection appear because it’s true! 
And now, for the quick shortcut: To put the Galaxy Tab into Airplane mode, 
press and hold the Power button and choose the Airplane Mode command.
To exit Airplane mode, repeat the steps in this section but remove the green 
check mark by touching the square next to Airplane Mode.
	
✓	Officially, the Galaxy Tab must be powered off when the plane is taking 
off or landing. See Chapter 2 for information on turning off the Tab.
	
✓	You can compose e-mail while the Tab is in Airplane mode. The mes­
sages aren’t sent until you disable Airplane mode and connect again 
with a data network.
	
✓	Bluetooth networking is disabled in Airplane mode. Even so:
	
✓	Many airlines now feature wireless networking onboard, which you can 
use with the Galaxy Tab — if you’re willing to pay for the service. Simply 
activate Wi-Fi on the Tab, per the directions in Chapter 17, and then con­
nect to the in-flight wireless network when it’s available.

255
 Chapter 19: Taking Your Tab with You
The Galaxy Tab Goes Abroad
You have no worries taking the Wi-Fi Galaxy Tab abroad. Because it uses 
Wi-Fi signals, your biggest issue is simply finding that type of Internet access 
so that you can use your Tab’s communications abilities. That rule also holds 
true for the cellular Tab, which can also use Wi-Fi abroad. But for the digital 
cellular signal, more precautions need to take place. After all, you don’t want 
to incur any data roaming charges, especially when they’re priced in zloty 
or pengö.
Traveling overseas with the Tab
The Tab works overseas. The two resources you need to heed are a way to 
recharge the battery and access Wi-Fi. As long as you have both of them, 
you’re pretty much set. (Data roaming is covered in the next section.)
The Tab’s AC plug can easily plug into a foreign AC adapter, which allows 
you to charge the Tab in outer Wamboolistan. From personal experience, I 
can tell you that I charged my Tab nightly while I spent time in France, and it 
worked like a charm.
Wi-Fi is pretty universal, and as long as your location offers this service, you 
can connect the Tab and pick up your e-mail, browse the web, or do what­
ever other Internet activities you desire. Even if you have to pay for Wi-Fi 
access, I believe that you’ll find it less expensive than paying a data roaming 
charge.
	
Even when you have Wi-Fi, you need to set up international credit on Skype. 
See Chapter 9 for more information on making Skype calls.
Disabling data roaming
When I’ve taken my cellular Galaxy Tab abroad, I’ve kept it in Airplane mode. 
If you do that, there’s no chance of data roaming charges, and you can still 
enable Wi-Fi. Even so, and just to be sure, you can disable data roaming on 
the Galaxy Tab by obeying these steps:
	
1.	On the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Open the Settings app.
	
3.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
4.	Choose Mobile Networks.
	
5.	Choose Global Data Roaming Access.
	
6.	Choose Deny Data Roaming Access.

256
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Of course, you don’t need to disable data roaming or keep the Tab stuck in 
Airplane mode if you simply want to use your Tab overseas and see what 
comes in the mail regarding a data bill. I prefer not to have such a surprise.
	
✓	Contact your digital cellular provider when you’re traveling abroad 
to ask about overseas data roaming. A subscription service or other 
options may even be available, especially when you plan to stay over­
seas for an extended length of time.
	
✓	You can determine whether the Tab is roaming by looking at the Status 
screen: Run the Settings app, choose About Tablet, and then choose 
Status. The Roaming item in the list describes whether or not the Tab is 
data roaming.

I

t’s entirely possible to own the amazing Galaxy Tab for the rest of your 
life and never even once bother to customize the gizmo. It’s not only 
possible, it’s sad. That’s because there exists great potential to 
create your own Tab. You can change so many things, from 
the way it looks to the way it sounds. The reason isn’t 
simply to change things because you can, but to make 
the Tab work best for how you use it. After all, it’s 
your Galaxy Tab.
Home Screen Decorating
Lots of interesting doodads are on the Galaxy Tab 
Home screen. Items such as icons, widgets, and 
shortcuts adorn the Home screen like olives in a 
festive salad. All that stuff can change, even the back­
ground images. You must simply know the key.
	
	 The key to modifying the Home screen lies in the Customize 
button, found in the upper-right corner of the screen. Yes, it’s the stan­
dard Add button, shown in the margin, but in this case you’re adding things 
to the Home screen.

258
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
After touching the Customize button, you see what I call the Customize 
screen, shown in Figure 20-1. That’s where you begin your Home screen deco­
rating adventure, as discussed in this section.

You can touch any panel in the Home screen panel overview to instantly dis­
play that panel. This trick isn’t really a shortcut, but it’s handy.
Hanging new wallpaper
The Home screen has two types of backgrounds, or wallpapers: traditional and 
live. A live wallpaper is animated. A not-so-live (traditional) wallpaper can be 
any image, such as a picture you’ve taken and stored in the Gallery app.
To set a new wallpaper for the Home screen, obey these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Customize button on the Home screen.
	
	 The Add to Home Screen menu appears, as shown in Figure 20-1.
	
2.	Choose Wallpapers.
	
	 You have three options:

259
 Chapter 20: Customize Your Galaxy Tab
	
	 Gallery: Choose a still image from those you’ve taken, stored in the 
Gallery app.
	
	 Live Wallpapers: Choose an animated or interactive wallpaper from 
a list.
	
	 Wallpapers: Choose a wallpaper from a range of images preinstalled on 
the Galaxy Tab.
	
3.	Select a wallpaper type.
	
4.	For the Gallery of Wallpapers item, choose whether you want the 
image to adorn the Home screen or the Lock screen.
	
	 Live wallpapers can be applied only to the Home screen.
	
5.	Choose the wallpaper you want from the list.
	
	 For the Gallery option, you see a preview of the wallpaper where you 
can select and crop part of the image.
	
	 For certain live wallpapers, a Settings button may appear. The settings 
let you customize certain aspects of the interactive wallpaper.
	
6.	Touch the OK or Set Wallpaper button to confirm your selection.
	
	 The new wallpaper takes over the Home screen or Lock screen.
Live wallpaper features some form of animation, which can often be interac­
tive. Otherwise, the wallpaper image scrolls slightly as you swipe from one 
Home screen panel to another.
	
	
✓	The Zedge app has some interesting wallpaper available. It’s an über-
repository of wallpaper images, collected from Android users all over 
the world. Check out Zedge at the Android Market; see Chapter 16.
	
	
✓	See Chapter 12 for more information about the Gallery app, including 
information on how cropping an image works.
Adding apps to the Home screen
The first thing I did on my Galaxy Tab was to place my most favorite apps on 
the Home screen. Here’s how that works:
	
1.	Touch the Apps Menu icon button on the Home screen.
	
	 To take a shortcut, you can also long-press any blank part of the Home 
screen.
	
2.	Long-press the app icon you want to add to the Home screen.
	
	 After a moment, you see the Home screen panel overview displayed at 
the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 20-2.

260
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Drag the icon to a 
Home screen panel
Choose an app icon

Figure 20-2: Stick an app on the Home screen.
	
3.	Drag the app down to one of the Home screen panels.
	
	 The app icon remains stuck under your finger tip. Lift your finger after 
you drag the icon all the way to a Home screen panel.
	
4.	Touch the Home screen panel to see a preview of your icon.
	
	 Don’t worry if it isn’t in the exact spot. The later section, “Moving and 
removing icons and widgets,” describes how to rearrange icons on the 
Home screen.
The app hasn’t moved: What you see is a copy. You can still find the app on 
the Apps Menu screen, but now the app is — more conveniently — available 
on the Home screen.
	
✓	Keep your favorite apps, those you use most often, on the Home screen.
	
✓	Icons on the Home screen are aligned to a grid. You can’t stuff more icons 
on the Home screen than will fit in the grid, so when a Home screen 
is full of icons (or widgets), use another Home screen, as described in 
Chapter 3.
	
✓	You can also add app icons by using the Customize screen. (Refer to 
Figure 20-1.) After touching the Customize button on the Home screen, 
choose App Shortcuts. Touch an app icon to add it to a Home screen 
panel, or you can drag the icon up to the Home screen panel overview.

261
 Chapter 20: Customize Your Galaxy Tab
Slapping down widgets
A widget works like a tiny, interactive or informative window, often providing 
a gateway into another app on the Galaxy Tab. Just as you can add apps to 
the Home screen, you can also add widgets.
The Galaxy Tab comes with a smattering of widgets preaffixed to the Home 
screen, possibly just to show you how they can be used. You can place even 
more widgets on the Home screen by following these steps:
	
1.	Touch the Customize icon button on the Home screen.
	
2.	Choose Widgets.
	
3.	Scroll the list to find the widget you want to add.
	
4.	Drag the widget to a Home screen panel.
	
	 The widget is plopped on the Home screen.
The variety of available widgets depends on the applications you have 
installed. Some applications come with widgets, some don’t. Some widgets 
come independently of any application.
	
✓	More widgets are available at the Android Market. See Chapter 16.
	
✓	You cannot install a widget when the Home screen has no room for it. 
Choose another panel or remove icons or widgets to make room.
	
✓	To remove a widget, see the later section, “Moving and removing icons 
and widgets.”
Creating shortcuts
A shortcut is a doodad you can place on the Home screen that’s neither an 
app nor a widget. Instead, a shortcut is a handy way to get at a feature or an 
informational tidbit stored in the Galaxy Tab without having to endure com­
plex gyrations.
For example, I have a shortcut on my Home screen that uses the Maps app 
Navigation feature to help me return to my house. I have the shortcut there 
in case of a zombie attack so that I can return home to my hardy stock of 
power tools.
To add a shortcut, touch the Customize icon button on the Home screen and 
choose the More category on the Customize screen. (Refer to Figure 20-1.) 
Choose an item to add from the list. What happens next depends on which 
shortcut you choose.

262
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
For example, when you choose a bookmark, you add a web page bookmark 
to the Home screen. Touch that shortcut to open the Browser app and pluck 
the web page from your list of bookmarks.
Choose a Contact shortcut to display contact information for a specific 
person.
A nerdy shortcut to add is the Settings shortcut. After choosing this item, you 
can select from a number of on–off options or status items that can appear 
on the Home screen as widgets.
Moving and removing icons and widgets
Icons and widgets are fastened to the Home screen by something akin to 
the same glue they use on sticky notes. You can easily pick up an icon or a 
widget, move it around, and then restick it. Unlike sticky notes, the icons and 
widgets never just fall off, or so I’m told.
To move an icon or a widget, long-press it. Eventually, the icon seems to lift 
and break free, as shown in Figure 20-3.
Delete icon
Long-press to “lift” icon
Snap to grid
Figure 20-3: Moving an icon about.
You can drag a free icon to another position on the Home screen or to 
another Home screen panel, or you can drag it to the Remove (trash can) 
icon that appears at the top right of the Home screen, shown in Figure 20-3.

263
 Chapter 20: Customize Your Galaxy Tab
Widgets can be moved around or deleted in the same manner as icons.
	
✓	Dragging a Home screen icon or widget to the Trash icon removes the 
icon or widget from the Home screen. It doesn’t uninstall the app or 
widget, which is still found on the Apps Menu screen. In fact, you can 
always add the icon or widget to the Home screen again, as described 
earlier in this chapter.
	
✓	When an icon hovers over the Remove icon, ready to be deleted, its 
color changes to red.
	
✓	See Chapter 16 for information on uninstalling applications.
	
✓	Your clue that an icon or widget is free and clear to navigate is that the 
Trash icon appears. (Refer to Figure 20-3.)
Lock Your Galaxy Tab
The Galaxy Tab features a basic lock screen: Simply slide the Unlock button 
outside of the locking ring, and the Tab is unlocked and ready to use. If you 
prefer to have a lock that’s not so easy to pick, you can choose from one of 
three types of lock screens: Pattern, PIN, and Password, as described in this 
section.
Finding the locks
Lock screen security is set on the Set Screen Lock window. Here’s how to get 
there:
	
	
1.	From the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu button.
	
	
2.	Choose the Settings app.
	
3.	Choose Location & Security.
	
4.	Choose Configure Screen Lock.
	
5.	If a screen lock is already set, you must trace the pattern or input the 
PIN or password to continue.
The Configure Screen Lock window lists five types of lock settings:
Off: The screen doesn’t lock. Even the Unlock button and locking ring 
doesn’t show up. Choosing this option disables all locks.
Not Secured: The Tab simply uses the standard locking screen: Slide the 
Unlock button to the unlocking ring, as described in Chapter 2. Choosing 
this option disables the Pattern, PIN, and Password locks.

264
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Pattern: To unlock the Tab, you must trace a pattern on the touchscreen.
PIN: The Tab is unlocked by typing a personal identification number (PIN).
Password: You must type a password to unlock the Galaxy Tab.
To set or remove a lock, refer to the following sections.
	
✓	The security you add affects the way you turn on and wake up your 
Galaxy Tab. See Chapter 2 for details.
	
✓	The security lock can be overridden when USB Debugging is enabled. 
Unless you’re writing software for the Galaxy Tab, however, odds are 
good that you’ll never have USB Debugging turned on.
Removing a lock
You use the Configure Screen Lock window not only to place a lock on the 
Galaxy Tab, but also to remove any existing locks.
After visiting the Configure Screen Lock window, as described in the preced­
ing section, you can choose the Off or Not Secured option.
To remove all screen locks, choose Off.
To restore the original Unlock button/unlocking ring screen lock, choose Not 
Secured.
Creating an unlock pattern
One of the most common ways to lock the Tab is to apply an unlock pattern: 
The pattern must be traced exactly as it was created to unlock the device and 
get access to your apps and other Galaxy Tab features.
	
1.	Summon the Configure Screen Lock screen.
	
	 Refer to the earlier section, “Finding the locks.”
	
2.	Choose Pattern.
	
	 If you’ve not yet set a pattern lock, you may see a tutorial describing the 
process; touch the Next button to skip over the dreary directions.
	
3.	Trace an unlock pattern.
	
	 Use Figure 20-4 as your inspiration. You can trace over the dots in any 
order, but you can trace over a dot only once. The pattern must cover at 
least four dots.

265
 Chapter 20: Customize Your Galaxy Tab
I began the pattern here
Pattern so far
Keep tracing
Figure 20-4: Setting an unlock pattern.
	
4.	Touch the Continue button.
	
5.	Redraw the pattern.
	
	 You need to prove to the doubtful Galaxy Tab that you know the 
pattern.
	
6.	Touch the Confirm button.
	
	 And the pattern lock is set.
	
Ensure that a check mark appears by Use Visible Pattern on the Location & 
Security window. The check mark ensures that the pattern shows up. For 
even more security, you can disable the option, but you have to be sure to 
remember how — and where — the pattern goes.
	
✓	To remove the pattern lock, set either Off or Not Secured as the type of 
lock, as described in the earlier section, “Finding the locks.”
	
✓	The unlock pattern can be as simple or complex as you like. I’m a big fan 
of simple.
	
✓	Wash your hands! Smudge marks on the display can betray your pattern.

266
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Setting a PIN
I suppose that using a PIN, or personal identification number, is more left-
brained than using a pattern lock. What’s yet another number to memorize?
A PIN lock is a code between 4 and 16 numbers long. It contains only num­
bers, 0 through 9. To set a PIN lock for your Galaxy Tab, follow the directions 
in the earlier section, “Finding the locks,” to reach the Configure Screen Lock 
window. Choose PIN from the list of locks.
Use the onscreen keyboard to type your PIN once, and touch the Continue 
button. Type the PIN again to confirm that you know it. The next time you 
turn on or wake up the Tab, you’ll need to type that PIN to get access.
To disable the PIN, reset the Galaxy Tab security level as described in the 
section “Removing a lock,” earlier in this chapter.
Assigning a password
The most secure way to lock the Galaxy Tab is to apply a full-on password. 
Unlike a PIN (refer to the preceding section), a password can contain num­
bers, symbols, and both upper- and lowercase letters.
Set a password by choosing Password from the Configure Screen Lock 
window; refer to the earlier section, “Finding the locks,” for information on 
getting to that screen. The password you select must be at least four charac­
ters long. Longer passwords are more secure.
Delaying the screen lock
You may notice that the screen lock shows up 
right away whenever you sleep the Galaxy Tab. 
It doesn’t have to: You can assign a delay to 
the screen lock, telling it to kick in after a given 
amount of time. That way you can wake up the 
Tab and not have to toil with a lock. It’s a feature 
that comes in handy if you find your Tab always 
falling asleep on you, and it works better than 
coffee.
To see the screen lock delay, choose the 
Timeout item on the Location & Security screen. 
Choose a timeout value from the scrolling list. 
The Tab comes configured with the Immediately 
value set. Other values you can choose range 
from 5 seconds up to 30 minutes. 

267
 Chapter 20: Customize Your Galaxy Tab
You’re prompted to type the password whenever you unlock the Galaxy 
Tab or whenever you try to change the screen lock. Touch the OK button to 
accept the password you’ve typed.
See the earlier section, “Removing a lock,” for information on resetting the 
password lock.
Various Galaxy Tab Adjustments
You have plenty of things to adjust, tune, and tweak on the Galaxy Tab. The 
Settings app is the gateway to all those options, and I’m sure you could waste 
hours there if you had hours to waste. My guess is that your time is precious; 
therefore, this section highlights some of the more worthy options and settings.
Singing a different tune
The Sound screen is where you control which sound the Galaxy Tab plays as 
a ringtone, but it’s also where you can set volume and vibration options.
To display the Sound screen, choose Sound from the list of categories on the 
left side of the Settings app screen.
Here are the worthy options on the Sound Settings screen:
Vibrate: Choose the Vibrate item to see the Vibrate menu. You have four 
options for vibrating the Galaxy Tab:
Always: The Tab always vibrates when it issues an alert.
Never: The Tab never vibrates.
Only in Silent Mode: The Tab vibrates when you activate Silent mode.
Only When Not in Silent Mode: The Tab vibrates all the time unless Silent 
mode is activated.
Volume: Though you can set the Galaxy Tab volume using the Volume but­
tons on the side of the gizmo, the Volume command on the Sound Settings 
screen lets you set the volume for a number of sound events, as shown in 
Figure 20-5. Table 20-1 describes what the various volume items control.

Notification Ringtone: Choose which sound you want to hear for a notifica­
tion alert. The list of preset sounds for the Galaxy Tab is shown on the Alarm 
Tones menu. Choose a sound or choose Silent (at the top of the list) for 
no sound.
Haptic Feedback: Though the Haptic Feedback item doesn’t make noise, 
you can activate it to have the Galaxy Tab vibrate slightly as you manipulate 
items on the touchscreen.

269
 Chapter 20: Customize Your Galaxy Tab
	
✓	You can put the Galaxy Tab in Silent mode by pressing the Down Volume 
button all the way down until the sound is set to zero, or silence.
	
✓	Unlike on a cell phone, you cannot assign music or your own audio to a 
Galaxy Tab ringtone.
Changing visual settings
Probably the key thing you want to adjust visually on the Galaxy Tab is 
screen brightness. This task is deftly handled by the Quick Settings panel:
	
1.	Touch the time in the lower-right corner of the screen to pop up the 
list of notifications.
	
2.	Touch the Quick Settings button.
	
	
3.	Adjust the Brightness slider right (brighter) or left (dimmer).
You can also touch the Auto button next to the slider to have the Tab auto­
matically adjust its brightness based on ambient light.
Brightness can also be set using the Settings app: On the main Settings app 
screen, choose the Screen category and then choose Brightness.
Another item worthy of note is the Timeout setting. Choose this option to 
see the Timeout menu, from which you can set the inactivity duration, after 
which the Galaxy Tab touchscreen turns itself off. I prefer a value of 1 Minute, 
which is how the Tab is preconfigured.
	
✓	The Screen Timeout setting is the setting that the Galaxy Tab uses to put 
itself into Sleep mode.
	
✓	See Chapter 3 for more information on Quick Settings.

I

 hear that the maintenance on the Eiffel Tower is ardu­
ous. Once a year, the French utterly disassemble the 
landmark; individually scrub every girder, nut, and 
bolt; and then put it all back together. The entire 
operation is performed early in the morning, so 
when Paris wakes up, no one notices. Well, the 
Tower is cleaner, but no one notices that it was 
completely disassembled, cleaned, and rebuilt. 
Truly, the French are amazing.
Fortunately, maintenance for your Galaxy Tab isn’t 
as consuming as maintenance on one of the world’s 
great monuments. For example, cleaning the Tab 
takes mere seconds, and no disassembly is required. It’s 
cinchy! Beyond covering maintenance, this chapter offers 
suggestions for using the battery, plus it gives you some help­
ful tips and Q&A.

272
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Regular Galactic Maintenance
Relax. Maintenance of the Galaxy Tab is simple and quick. Basically, I can 
summarize it in three words: Keep it clean. Beyond that, another mainte­
nance task worthy of attention is backing up the information stored on 
your Tab.
Keeping it clean
You probably already keep your Galaxy Tab clean. Perhaps you’re one of 
those people who use their sleeves to wipe the touchscreen. Of course, 
better than your sleeve is something called a microfiber cloth. This item can 
be found at any computer- or office-supply store.
	
✓	Never use any liquid to clean the touchscreen — especially ammonia or 
alcohol. Those substances damage the touchscreen, rendering it unable 
to read your input. Further, such harsh chemicals can smudge the dis­
play, making it more difficult to see.
	
✓	If the screen keeps getting dirty, consider adding a screen protector. This 
specially designed cover prevents the screen from getting scratched or 
dirty but also lets you use your finger on the touchscreen. Be sure that 
the screen protector is designed for use with the Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	The screen protectors I picked up at the Verizon Store also came with a 
handy microfiber cloth.
Backing up your stuff
A backup is a safety copy of information. For your Galaxy Tab, the backup 
copy includes contact information, music, photos, video, and apps you’ve 
installed, plus any settings you’ve made to customize your Tab. Copying that 
information to another source is one way to keep the information safe in case 
anything happens to your Galaxy Tab.
Yes, a backup is a good thing. Lamentably, there’s no universal method of 
backing up the stuff on your Galaxy Tab.
Your Google account information is backed up automatically. That informa­
tion includes your Contacts list, Gmail inbox, and Calendar app appoint­
ments. Because that information automatically syncs with the Internet, a 
backup is always present.

273
 Chapter 21: Galaxy Tab Health, Happiness, and Maintenance
To confirm that your Google account information is being backed up, heed 
these steps:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose Accounts and Sync.
	
	
4.	Touch the green Sync button by your Google account name.
	
	
5.	Ensure that check marks appear by every item in the list.
	
	
	 On my Galaxy Tab, the list includes Books, Calendar, Contacts, Gmail, 
Google+, and Picasa Web Albums.
	
6.	Touch the Back icon button.
	
7.	Optionally, ensure that your other accounts are being synchronized 
as well.
	
	 When you have more than one Google account synchronized with your 
Galaxy Tab, repeat Steps 1 through 6 for each account.
	
8.	Touch the Back icon button to return to the main Settings screen.
	
9.	Choose Privacy.
	
10.	Ensure that a check mark appears by the item Back Up My Data.
	
	 You should see a check mark there. If not, touch the square to add one.
Beyond your Google account, which is automatically backed up, the rest of 
the information can be manually backed up. You can choose to either syn­
chronize information on the Galaxy Tab with your computer using an app 
such as doubleTwist, or you can manually copy files from the Tab’s internal 
storage to the computer as a form of backup.
Yes, I agree: Manual backup isn’t an example of technology making your life 
easier.
	
✓	See Chapter 18 for information about exchanging files between your 
computer and the Galaxy Tab.
	
✓	A backup of the data stored on the Galaxy Tab would include all data, 
including photos, videos, and music. Specifically, the folders you should 
copy are DCIM, Download, and Music. Additional folders to copy 
include folders named after apps you’ve downloaded, such as Aldiko, 
Kindle, Kobo, layar, and other folders named after the apps that 
created them.

274
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Updating the system
Every so often, a new version of the Galaxy Tab’s operating system becomes 
available. It’s an Android update because Android is the name of the operat­
ing system, not because the Galaxy Tab thinks that it’s some type of robot.
When an automatic update occurs, you see an alert or a message appear, 
indicating that a system upgrade is available. You usually have three options:
	
✓	Install Now
	
✓	Install Later
	
✓	More Info
My advice is to choose Install Now and get it over with — unless you’re doing 
something urgent, in which case you can put off the update until later by 
choosing Install Later.
	
✓	You can manually check for updates: In the Settings app, choose About 
Tablet and then choose System Updates. When your system is up-to-
date, the screen tells you so. Otherwise, you find directions for updating 
the Android operating system.
	
✓	Non-Android system updates might also be issued. For example, 
Samsung may send out an update to the Galaxy Tab’s guts. This type of 
update is often called a firmware update. As with Android updates, my 
advice is to accept all firmware updates.
Battery Care and Feeding
Perhaps the most important item you can monitor and maintain on your 
Galaxy Tab is its battery. The battery supplies the necessary electrical juice 
by which the device operates. Without battery power, your Tab is basically 
an expensive trivet. Keep an eye on the battery.
Monitoring the battery
You can find information about the Galaxy Tab’s battery status at the bottom 
right of the screen, in the status area, next to the time. The icons used to dis­
play battery status are shown in Figure 21-1.

275
 Chapter 21: Galaxy Tab Health, Happiness, and Maintenance
Battery is fully charged, the Tab is happy.
Battery is starting to drain.
Battery is low; you’re urged to charge soon.
Battery is very low; stop using and charge at once!
Battery is being charged.
Figure 21-1: Battery status icons.
You might also see an icon for a dead battery, but for some reason I can’t get 
my Galaxy Tab to turn on and display that icon.
When you find the teensy battery icons (refer to Figure 21-1) too vague, you 
can check the specific battery level by viewing the notification pop-up: At the 
Home screen, touch the time. You see the notifications displayed, but above 
that is the Tab’s current status. Listed are the date, time, Wi-Fi or cellular 
data network, and the percentage of battery life remaining.
The next section describes features that consume battery power and how to 
deal with battery issues.
	
Heed those low-battery warnings! The Galaxy Tab alerts you whenever the 
battery level gets low, as shown in Figure 21-2.

276
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Another warning shows up when 
the battery level gets seriously 
low, though I’ve never seen that 
warning because I find the message 
in Figure 21-2 serious enough to 
move me to action: I either plug in 
the Tab or turn it off.
	
✓	When the battery level is too 
low, the Galaxy Tab shuts 
itself off.

battery power is to connect the Tab to a power source: Either plug it 
into a wall socket or connect it to a computer by using a USB cable. The 
Galaxy Tab begins charging itself immediately; plus, you can use the 
device while it’s charging.
	
✓	You don’t have to fully charge the Galaxy Tab to use it. When you have 
only 20 minutes to charge and you get only a 70 percent battery level, 
that’s great. Well, it’s not great, but it’s far better than a lower battery 
level.
	
✓	Battery percentage values are best-guess estimates. The Galaxy Tab has 
a hearty battery that can last for hours. But when the battery meter gets 
low, the battery drains faster. So, if you get 8 hours of use from the Tab 
and the battery meter shows 20 percent left, those numbers don’t imply 
that 20 percent equals 2 more hours of use. In practice, the amount of 
time you have left is much less than that. As a rule, when the battery 
percentage value gets low, the battery appears to drain faster.
Determining what is sucking up power
The Galaxy Tab is smart enough to know which of its features use the most 
battery power. You can check it out for yourself: 
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose About Tablet.
	
4.	Choose Battery Use.
	
	 You see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 21-3.
Figure 21-2: A low-battery warning.

277
 Chapter 21: Galaxy Tab Health, Happiness, and Maintenance
Figure 21-3: Things that drain the battery.
The number and variety of items listed on the Battery Use screen depend on 
what you’ve been doing between charges and how many apps you’re using.
Carefully note which applications consume the most battery power. You can 
curb your use of these programs to conserve juice — though, honestly, your 
savings are negligible. See the next section for battery-saving advice.
Not everything you’ve done shows up on the Battery Use screen. (Refer to 
Figure 21-3.) For example, even after I read a Kindle book for about half an 
hour, Kindle didn’t show up. Also, I’ve seen the Gallery app show up from 
time to time, even though I’ve not used it.
	
At the time this book went to press, no feature could control power manage­
ment on the Galaxy Tab. A future update of the Android operating system 
may offer this type of management, in which case you can control how the 
Galaxy Tab uses power, set timeouts, and adjust power-saving features.
Extending battery life
A surefire way to make a battery last a good long time is to never turn on the 
device in the first place. That’s kind of impractical, so rather than let you use 
your Galaxy Tab as an expensive paperweight, I offer a smattering of sugges­
tions you can follow to help prolong battery life in your Galaxy Tab:
Turn off vibration options: The Tab’s vibration is caused by a teensy motor. 
Though you don’t see much battery savings by disabling the vibration 
options, it’s better than no savings. See Chapter 20 for information on dis­
abling vibration options.

278
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
Lower the volume: Additionally, consider lowering the volume for the vari­
ous noises the Galaxy Tab makes, especially notifications. Information on set­
ting volume options is also found in Chapter 20.
Dim the screen: If you look at Figure 21-3 (earlier in this chapter), you see 
that the display (labeled Screen) sucks down quite a lot of battery power. 
Though a dim screen can be more difficult to see, especially outdoors, it defi­
nitely saves on battery life.
Turn off Bluetooth: When you’re not using Bluetooth, turn it off. See Chapter 
17 for information on Bluetooth, though you can turn it off easily from the 
quick actions at the top of the notification panel.
Turn off Wi-Fi: It’s a major trade-off, but while Wi-Fi networking keeps the 
Galaxy Tab on the Internet, it does drain the battery. Because I tend to use 
Wi-Fi in only one spot, I keep the Tab plugged in. Away from a single location, 
however, Wi-Fi “wanders” and isn’t useful for an Internet connection anyway. 
So why not turn it off? Refer to Chapter 17 for information on Wi-Fi.
Help and Troubleshooting
Wouldn’t it be great if you could have an avuncular, Mr. Wizard-type avail­
able at a moment’s notice? He could just walk in and, with a happy smile on 
his face and a reassuring hand on your shoulder, let you know what the prob­
lem is and how to fix it. Never mind that such a thing would be creepy — 
getting helpful advice is worth it.
Fixing random and annoying problems
Here are some typical problems you may encounter on the Galaxy Tab and 
my suggestions for a solution:
General trouble: For just about any problem or minor quirk, consider 
restarting the Galaxy Tab: Turn it off and then turn it on again. This proce­
dure will most likely fix a majority of the annoying problems you encounter.
Check the cellular data connection: As you move about, the cellular signal 
can change. In fact, you may observe the status bar icon change from 4G 
LTE to 3G to even the dreaded E or — worse — nothing, depending on the 
strength and availability of the cellular data service.
My advice for random signal weirdness is to wait. Oftentimes, the signal 
comes back after a few minutes. If it doesn’t, the cellular data network might 

279
 Chapter 21: Galaxy Tab Health, Happiness, and Maintenance
be down, or you may just be in an area with lousy service. Consider changing 
your location.
Check the Wi-Fi connection: For Wi-Fi connections, you have to ensure that 
the Wi-Fi is set up properly and working. This process usually involves pes­
tering the person who configured the Wi-Fi router or, in a coffee shop, both­
ering the cheerful person with the bad haircut who serves you coffee.
Reset the Wi-Fi connection: Perhaps the issue isn’t with the Galaxy Tab at 
all, but rather with the Wi-Fi network. Some networks have a “lease time” 
after which your Tab might be disconnected. If so, follow the directions in 
Chapter 17 for turning off the Tab’s Wi-Fi and then turn it on again. That often 
solves the issue.
Music is playing and you want it to stop: It’s awesome that the Galaxy Tab 
continues to play music while you do other things. Getting the music to stop 
quickly, however, requires some skill. Primarily, you need skill at popping up 
the notifications and touching the Pause button that appears in the currently 
playing song’s notification.
An app has run amok: Sometimes, 
apps that misbehave let you know. 
You see a warning on the screen 
announcing the app’s stubborn dis­
position, such as the warning shown 
in Figure 21-4. When that happens, 
touch the Force Close button to shut 
down the errant app.
When you don’t see a warning or when an app appears to be unduly obsti­
nate, you can shut ’er down the manual way, by following these steps:
	
1.	From the Apps Menu, choose the Settings icon.
	
2.	Choose Applications.
	
3.	Choose Manage Applications.
	
	 If you touch the Running item at the top of the Applications screen, you 
see only the apps that are running. That helps narrow the list.
	
4.	Choose the application that’s causing you distress.
	
	 For example, a program doesn’t start or says that it’s busy or has some 
other issue.
	
5.	Touch the Stop button.
	
	 The program stops.
Figure 21-4: Halting an app run amok.

280
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
After stopping the program, try opening it again to see whether it works. If 
the program continues to run amok, contact its developer: Open the Market 
app. At the main Market app screen, choose My Apps. Choose the app you’re 
having trouble with, and touch the See Details button. Scroll to the bottom of 
the details screen, and choose Send Email to Developer. Send the developer a 
message describing the problem.
	
Reset the Galaxy Tab software: When all else fails, you can do the drastic 
thing and reset all Tab software, essentially returning it to the state it was 
in when it first popped out of the box. Obviously, you need not perform this 
step lightly. In fact, consider finding support (see the next section) before 
you start the following process:
	
1.	Start the Settings app, found in the Apps Menu.
	
2.	Choose Privacy.
	
3.	Choose Factory Data Reset.
	
4.	Touch the Reset Tablet button.
	
5.	Touch the Erase Everything button to confirm.
	
	 All the information you’ve set or stored on the Galaxy Tab is purged. 
That includes apps you’ve downloaded, music, synchronized accounts, 
everything.
Again, do not follow these steps unless you’re certain that they will fix the 
problem or you’re under orders to do so from someone in Tech Support.
	
You can also choose to reset the Galaxy Tab’s software and erase everything 
should you ever return or sell your Galaxy Tab. Of course, you probably 
love your Galaxy Tab so much that the mere thought of selling it makes you 
blanch.
Getting support
You can use two sources for support for your Galaxy Tab. For cellular Tabs, 
the first source of support is your cellular provider. The second source, or 
only source if you have a Wi-Fi Tab, is Samsung. Or, perhaps, if you were 
suckered into a long-term service agreement at some Big Box store, you can 
try getting support from it.
Before you contact someone about support, you need to know the device’s ID:
	
1.	From the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.

281
 Chapter 21: Galaxy Tab Health, Happiness, and Maintenance
	
3.	Choose About Tablet.
	
	 The Galaxy Tab’s model number is listed, as well as the Android version.
Jot down the model number and Android version! Do it right here:
Model Number: _______________________________________________________
Android Version: ______________________________________________________
In the United States, you can contact Verizon for support at (800) 922-0204. 
You can also visit the Verizon website:
http://support.vzw.com
For hardware and other issues, you have to contact Samsung. The support 
number is (800) 726-7864. The Samsung support website is
www.samsung.com/us/support
	
No one likes wading through bottomless automatic customer support sys­
tems. Odds are good that you merely want to speak to a human. I’ve found 
that the fastest way to do that is to keep pressing the Zero key after you 
phone into the system. This process eventually turns you over to a live 
person who, hopefully, can either deal with your problem or connect you 
with someone who can.
Valuable Galaxy Tab Q&A
I love Q&A! That’s because not only is it an effective way to express certain 
problems and solutions, but some of the questions might also cover things 
I’ve been wanting to ask.
“I can’t turn the Tab on (or off)!”
Yes, sometimes the Galaxy Tab locks up. I even asked Samsung about this 
issue specifically, and the folks there told me it’s impossible for the Galaxy 
Tab to seize. Despite this denial, I’ve discovered that if you press and hold 
the Power button for about 8 seconds, the Tab turns either off or on, depend­
ing on which state it’s in.

282
Part IV: Nuts & Bolts 
I’ve had a program lock the Galaxy Tab tight when the 8-second Power switch 
trick didn’t work. In that case, I waited 12 minutes or so, just letting the Tab 
sit there and do nothing. Then I pressed and held the Power button for about 
8 seconds, and it turned itself back on.
“The touchscreen doesn’t work!”
A touchscreen, such as the one used on the Galaxy Tab, requires a human 
finger for proper interaction. The Tab interprets the static potential between 
the human finger and the device to determine where the touchscreen is being 
touched.
You cannot use the touchscreen when you’re wearing gloves, unless they’re 
specially designed, static-carrying gloves that claim to work on touchscreens.
The touchscreen might also fail when the battery power is low or when the 
Galaxy Tab has been physically damaged.
	
I’ve been informed that there is an Android app for cats. That implies that 
the touchscreen can also interpret a feline paw for proper interaction. Either 
that, or the cat can hold a human finger in its mouth and manipulate the 
app that way. Because I don’t have the app, I can’t tell for certain.
“The battery doesn’t charge!”
Start from the source: Is the wall socket providing power? Is the cord plugged 
in? The cable may be damaged, so try another cable.
When charging from a USB port on a computer, ensure that the computer is 
turned on. Most computers don’t provide USB power when they’re turned off.
“The Tab gets so hot that it turns itself off!”
Yikes! An overheating gadget can be a nasty problem. Judge how hot the 
Galaxy Tab is by seeing whether you can hold it in your hand: When it’s too 
hot to hold, it’s too hot. If you’re using the Galaxy Tab to cook an egg, it’s 
too hot.
Turn off the Galaxy Tab and let the battery cool.

283
 Chapter 21: Galaxy Tab Health, Happiness, and Maintenance
If the overheating problem continues, have the Galaxy Tab looked at for 
potential repair. The battery might need to be replaced, and as far as I can 
tell, there’s no way to remove and replace the Galaxy Tab battery by yourself.
	
Do not continue to use any gizmo that’s too hot! The heat damages the elec­
tronics. It can also start a fire.
“The Tab doesn’t do Landscape mode!”
Not every app takes advantage of the Galaxy Tab’s ability to orient itself in 
Landscape mode, or even upside-down mode. For example, many games set 
their orientations one way and refuse to change, no matter how you hold the 
Tab. So, just because the app doesn’t go into Landscape mode, that doesn’t 
mean anything is broken.
	
	 Confirm that the orientation lock isn’t on: Pull up the notifications and touch 
the Quick Settings button at the top of the notification panel. Ensure that the 
Auto-Rotate Screen item is on; otherwise, the screen doesn’t reorient itself.

Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
In This Chapter
▶	Finding out which way is up
▶	Reviewing your recent apps
▶	Halting services
▶	Putting a Settings shortcut on the Home screen
▶	Removing the vocal dirty word filter
▶	Telling the Tab what to do
▶	Using contact screen shortcuts
▶	Finding your wayward Galaxy Tab
▶	Setting locations for your schedule
▶	Turning off the 4G LTE signal
A

 tip is a small suggestion, a word of advice often 
spoken from experience or knowledge. A trick, 
which is something not many know, usually causes 
amazement or surprise. A shortcut is a quick way 
to get home, even though it crosses the old grave­
yard and you never quite know whether Old Man 
Witherspoon is the groundskeeper or a zombie.
I’d like to think that just about everything in this 
book is a tip, trick, or shortcut for using the Galaxy 
Tab. Even so, I’ve distilled a list of items in this chap­
ter that are definitely worthy of note.
Discover Which Way Is Up
Maybe I’m the only one who has this issue: The Galaxy Tab is pretty plain. 
It’s difficult for me to tell which edge is the top edge, especially given that 
the screen auto-rotates into an up position no matter how I hold the Tab. 

288
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Normally such an issue shouldn’t be a problem, but I like to know which edge 
has the camera and which edge has the data connector.
To solve the problem, I stuck a tiny strip of white tape along the top, front 
edge of the Tab. It’s just a sliver of white tape, which I pared back using an 
X-ACTO knife. That way I can always tell which edge of the Tab is the top. Life 
with my Galaxy Tab has been far less frustrating with that tiny piece of tape 
in place.
Summon a Recently Opened App
	
	 I have to kick myself in the head every time I return to the Apps Menu screen 
to, once again, page through the panels o’ icons to dig up an app I just opened. 
Why bother? Because I can summon the list of recently opened apps by 
touching the Recent Apps button at the bottom left of the Home screen.
	
Using the Recent Apps button is the best way you can switch between two 
running apps. So when you need to switch, for example, between Email and 
the Browser, just touch the Recent Apps button and choose the bottom item 
on the list. It’s effectively the same thing as the Alt+Tab key combination in 
Windows.
Stop Unneeded Services
Some things may be going on in your Galaxy Tab that you don’t need or even 
suspect. These activities include the monitoring of information, apps that 
update, or tiny programs that check on the device’s status. The technical 
term for these activities is services.
When a service has started that you don’t want, or have been requested to 
stop, you can halt the service. You can also halt programs that may be spin­
ning away in the background when there’s no other apparent way to stop the 
thing. Here’s how:
	
1.	While at the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose Applications.
	
4.	Choose Running.
	
	 You see the Running Applications screen, similar to Figure 22-1.

5.	Touch an app.
	
	 Most likely, it’s an app you recognize that you don’t need running or 
something you need to stop because it’s doing something unwanted 
or — heaven forbid — unsavory.
	
6.	On the app’s Running Services screen, touch the Stop button.
When you stop a service, you free resources used by that service. These 
resources include memory and processor power. The result of stopping 
unneeded services can be improved performance.
The service you stopped will most likely start up again the next time you 
start the Galaxy Tab, or if you run the app. The only way to halt a specific 
service for all eternity is to uninstall the program associated with that ser­
vice, which is a drastic step. Even then, not every app can be removed; pre­
installed apps and phone company apps are stuck to your Galaxy Tab like 
August ticks on a hound dog.
	
✓	Do not randomly disable services. Many of them are required for the 
Galaxy Tab to do its job or for the apps you use to carry out their tasks. 
If you disable a service you don’t recognize and the device begins to 
act funny, turn the Galaxy Tab off and then on again. That should fix the 
problem.
	
✓	You can use the Running Services screen to stop applications run amok, 
but don’t use it to quit an app you can otherwise quit. Most apps have 

290
Part V: The Part of Tens 
an Exit or Sign Out command. Use the Menu icon button to locate that 
command and use it instead of killing the app on the Running Services 
screen.
	
✓	The weird bar graph at the bottom of the Running Services screen (refer 
to Figure 22-1) illustrates memory usage in your Galaxy Tab. The black 
area represents services that cannot be stopped or killed. The gray 
area represents memory used by the Android system or your apps. The 
green area shows free, or unused, memory.
Add Settings Shortcuts to the Home Screen
Unlike Android cell phones I love and use, the Galaxy Tab seems to lack a 
handy way to get to the Settings app screen. It’s not that you need to get 
there often, but I find having a speedy way to do so can really help, especially 
with some common tasks.
The answer is to place Settings app shortcuts on the Home screen. Here’s 
how it works:
	
	
1.	While at the Home screen, touch the Customize icon button.
	
	
2.	Choose the More category.
	
	
3.	Choose Select Settings.
	
	 A menu of shortcuts appears. It’s a scrolling list, so there are several 
more items than you see initially.
	
4.	Choose an item to place on the Home screen.
	
	 A Settings shortcut icon is placed on the screen.
The shortcut icon looks like the Settings icon, but it’s not: Instead it’s a direct 
link to the item you chose in Step 4. So although the shortcut doesn’t turn 
something on or off, it quickly gets you to that screen in the Settings app.
	
✓	Don’t worry about where the shortcut icon is placed. You can move short­
cut icons just like anything else on the Home screen. See Chapter 20.
	
✓	I placed a Bluetooth Settings shortcut on my Tab’s Home screen. That’s 
because I turn Bluetooth on and off frequently and there’s no Bluetooth 
item on the Quick Settings screen.
	
✓	If you can’t decide which Settings item to place on the Home screen, 
just put a shortcut to the Settings app itself. I find myself using that app 
often enough that a shortcut is warranted.

 Chapter 22: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
Add Spice to Dictation
I feel that too few people use dictation, despite how handy it can be. Whether 
or not you use it, you might notice that it occasionally censors some of the 
words you utter. Perhaps you’re the kind of person who won’t put up with 
that kind of s***.
Relax, b******. You can lift the vocal censorship ban by following these 
steps:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose Language & Input.
	
4.	Choose Voice Recognition Settings.
	
5.	Remove the check mark by the option Block Offensive Words.
And just what are offensive words? I would think that censorship would be an 
offensive word. But no, apparently the words s***, c***, and even innocent 
little old a****** are deemed offensive by Google Voice. What the h***?
Command the Tab with Your Voice
I just tried this trick for my son, and he was really impressed: I touched the 
Dictation button on the Home screen and uttered, “Listen to the Beatles.” In 
less than five seconds, the Galaxy Tab began playing the White Album.
	
	 You can use the Dictation button (shown in the margin) to bark orders at 
your Tab. Or, if you can’t find the Dictation button, start the Voice Search 
app from the Apps menu.
Here are just a few of the phrases you can utter into the Tab when you see 
the Speak Now prompt:
	
✓	Watch a video.
	
✓	Listen to (artist, album, song).
	
✓	Send e-mail to (contact).
	
✓	Set alarm for (time).
	
✓	Go to (address, map location).
Alas, try as I might, the Tab never responds when I say, “Make me a sandwich!”

Create a Contact Screen Shortcut
The people you contact most often are deserving of their own contact short­
cuts on the Home screen. You just don’t realize how useful such a thing is 
until you have one.
To create a contact screen shortcut, follow these steps:
	
1.	Long-press the Home screen.
	
	 The Customize screen appears.
	
2.	Choose the More category.
	
3.	Choose Contact.
	
4.	Choose a contact from the Contacts list.
	
	 Preferably, choose someone whom you frequently and electronically 
contact.
An icon representing the contact appears on the screen. If the contact has an 
associated picture, you see the picture. Otherwise, you see a generic contact 
icon, but it has a teeny menu indicator in the lower-right corner. If you touch 
the contact, that menu appears, displaying a list of quick tasks for the con­
tact, as shown in Figure 22-2.

Phone or chat with Skype
Compose e-mail
Locate on the map
Figure 22-2: Quick tasks for a contact screen shortcut.

293
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
Choose a quick task for a contact by touching the task’s icon, as shown in 
Figure 22-2. For some contacts with lots of quick tasks, you may have to 
scroll the quick tasks left or right to see them all.
The number of quick task icons that appears for a contact depends on how 
much information you have available for the contact, such as e-mail address; 
cell phone number (for texting); or linked contacts for Facebook, Skype, 
Twitter, and so on.
	
✓	When multiple sources, such as e-mail addresses, exist for a contact, 
you may also see a settings or wrench icon. Choose that icon to select 
which accounts to use for the quick tasks.
	
✓	To hide the quick contact information, simply touch another part of the 
Home screen or press the Back icon button.
	
✓	A contact’s Facebook status may appear beneath the name, which isn’t 
shown in Figure 22-2.
	
✓	Just touch the contact screen shortcut to see the quick tasks. When you 
long-press the shortcut, the Galaxy Tab believes that you want to move 
or delete the icon.
Find Your Lost Galaxy Tab
Someday you may lose your Galaxy Tab. It might be for a panic-filled few 
seconds, or it might be for forever. The hardware solution is to weld a heavy 
object to the Tab, such as a bowling ball or furnace, yet that kind of defeats 
the entire mobile/wireless paradigm. The software solution is to use a cell 
phone locator service.
Even though the Galaxy Tab isn’t a cell phone, you can use the same apps 
that cell phones use to help find a wayward Galaxy Tab. Those apps use the 
cellular signal as well as the Tab’s GPS to help locate a missing gizmo.
Many apps available on the Android Market can help locate your Galaxy Tab. 
I’ve not tried them all. Here are some suggestions:
	
✓	Plan B from Lookout Mobile Security
	
✓	Norton Mobile Security
	
✓	Security Pro
Most of these services require that you set up a web page account to assist in 
locating your Galaxy Tab. They also enable services that send updates to the 
Internet. The updates assist in tracking your Galaxy Tab, in case it becomes 
lost or is stolen.

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Enter Location Information for Your Events
When you create an event for the Calendar app, be sure to enter the event 
location. You can type either an address (if you know it) or the name of the 
location. The key is to type the text as you would type it in the Maps app 
when searching for a location. That way, you can touch the event location 
and the Galaxy Tab displays it on the touchscreen. Finding an appointment 
couldn’t be easier.
	
✓	See Chapter 10 for more information about the Maps app.
	
✓	See Chapter 15 for details about the Calendar.
Disable 4G LTE Service
With the über-speed of the 4G LTE network, it’s very easy to blow by your 
monthly data plan allowance. If you’re cheap (like me), you probably have an 
allowance of only 2GB (gigabytes) of data per month before another charge 
pops up on your bill. To help avoid that, you can get a higher-capacity data 
plan, or you can just choose to forego the 4G LTE experience.
To limit the Galaxy Tab to use only the 3G (or slower) networks, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	At the Home screen, touch the Apps Menu icon button.
	
2.	Choose Settings.
	
3.	Choose Wireless & Networks.
	
4.	Choose Mobile Networks, then System Selection.
	
5.	Choose CDMA Mode.
	
6.	Choose Automatic.
To reactivate the 4G LTE network, repeat these steps but choose LTE 
Automatic in Step 4.
	
Changing the network doesn’t alter your cell phone plan’s data service limit. 
All it does is ensure that you’ll take longer to get to that limit.

▶	Turning the Tab sideways
▶	Locking orientation

H

ave you ever tried to tie string around your finger 
to remember something? I’ve not attempted that 
technique just yet. The main reason is that I keep 
forgetting to buy string and have no way to remind 
myself.
For your Galaxy Tab, some things are definitely 
worth remembering. Out of the long, long list, I’ve 
come up with ten good ones.
Use Dictation
It’s such a handy feature, yet I constantly forget to use 
it: Rather than type short text messages, use dictation. You 
can access dictation from any onscreen keyboard by touching the 
Microphone button. Speak the text; the text appears. Simple.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
See Chapter 4 for information on Dictation and also how to put the 
Microphone button on the onscreen keyboard.
Portrait Orientation
I enjoy the occasional portrait view. Apps such as the Browser, Kindle, and 
even Email can look much better in a vertical orientation. It’s easier to read 
a conversation in the chatting apps, such as Talk and Skype, when things are 
narrow. Simply turn the Tab over on its side and start reading.
	
Not every app supports portrait orientation. Some apps, specifically some 
games, appear only in landscape orientation.
Orientation Lock
The opposite of remembering that the Galaxy Tab has portrait orientation 
(see the preceding section) is forgetting that it has an orientation lock fea­
ture. When engaged, the orientation lock prevents the screen from adjusting 
between Landscape and Portrait modes: The screen stays fixed in whichever 
orientation it was in when you set the orientation lock.
To set the orientation lock, ensure that the Auto-Rotate Screen item is set to 
Off in the Quick Settings screen. See Chapter 3 for more information about 
the Quick Settings.
Use the Keyboard Suggestions
Don’t forget to take advantage of the suggestions that appear above the 
onscreen keyboard when you’re typing text. In fact, you don’t even need to 
touch a suggestion; to replace your text with the highlighted suggestion, 
simply touch the onscreen keyboard’s Space key. Zap! The word appears.
To ensure that suggestions are enabled, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start the Settings app.
	
2.	Choose Language & Input.
	
3.	Choose Configure Input Methods.

 Chapter 23: Ten Things to Remember
	
4.	Choose the Settings item in the Samsung Keypad section.
	
5.	Ensure that a check mark appears by XT9, the predictive text option.
Also refer to Chapter 4 for additional information on using the keyboard 
suggestions.
Things That Consume Lots of Battery Juice
Three items on the Galaxy Tab suck down battery power faster than a mas­
sive alien fleet is defeated by a plucky antihero who just wants the girl:
	
✓	Wi-Fi networking
	
✓	Bluetooth
	
✓	Navigation
Both Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth require extra power for their wireless 
radios. The amount isn’t much, but it’s enough that I would consider shutting 
them down when battery power gets low.
Navigation is certainly handy, but because the Galaxy Tab touchscreen is on 
the entire time and dictating text to you, the battery drains rapidly. If pos­
sible, try to plug the Tab into the car’s power socket when you’re navigating.
See Chapter 21 for more information on managing the Galaxy Tab’s battery.
Use a Docking Stand
I tend to keep my Galaxy Tab in one spot when I’m not on the road. The mul­
timedia stand is a helpful way to hold the Tab, to keep it propped up and 
easy to use. Because I use the stand as home base for the Tab, I always know 
where the Tab is, and because I don’t have the cleanest of desktops, I can 
always find the Tab despite ominous swells in seas of paper.
Given the choice of multimedia stand or keyboard dock, I prefer the multime­
dia stand. The keyboard stand is nice, but it takes up some room, and I don’t 
do much typing on my Tab. (Refer to the section “Use Dictation,” earlier in 
this chapter.)

The Galaxy Tab Can Make Phone Calls
Yeah, I know: It’s not a phone. I wish it were (and I’m sure Samsung does 
as well), but the Galaxy Tab lacks a native ability to use the cellular system 
for making phone calls. Even so, with apps such as Talk and Skype, you can 
make phone calls and even video chat with others. Refer to Chapter 9 for 
details.
Keep Up with Your Schedule
The Calendar app can certainly be handy to remind you of upcoming dates 
and generally keep you on schedule. A great way to augment the calendar is 
to employ the Calendar widget on the Home screen.
The Calendar widget lists the current date and then a long list of upcoming 
appointments. It’s a great way to check your schedule, especially when you 
use your Tab all the time. I recommend sticking the Calendar widget right on 
the main Home screen.
See Chapter 20 for information on adding widgets to the Home screen; 
Chapter 15 covers the Calendar app.
Snap a Pic of That Contact
Here’s something I always forget: Whenever you’re near one of your contacts, 
take the person’s picture. Sure, some people are bashful, but most folks are 
flattered. The idea is to build up your Contacts list so that all contacts have 
photos.
	
When taking a picture, be sure to show it to the person before you assign it 
to the contact. Let them decide whether it’s good enough. Or, if you just want 
to be rude, assign a crummy-looking picture. Heck, you don’t even have to 
do that: Just take a random picture of anything and assign it to a contact: A 
plant. A rock. Your cat. But, seriously, keep in mind that the Tab can take a 
contact’s picture the next time you meet up with that person.
See Chapter 11 for more information on using the Galaxy Tab’s camera and 
assigning a picture to a contact.

 Chapter 23: Ten Things to Remember
The Search Command
Google is known worldwide for its searching abilities. By gum, the word 
Google is now synonymous with searching. So please don’t forget that the 
Galaxy Tab, which uses the Google Android operating system, has a powerful 
Search command.
	
	 The Search command is not only powerful, but also available all over. You 
can touch the Search icon button in any app where you can find it. Use it to 
search for information, locations, people — you name it. It’s handy. Use it.

here are more than 100,000 apps available at the 
Android Market — so many that it would take you 
more than a relaxing evening to discover them all. 
Rather than list every single app, I’ve culled from the 
lot some apps that I find exceptional — that show 
the diversity of the Android Market but also how 
well the Galaxy Tab can run Android apps.
Every app listed in this chapter is free; see Chapter 
16 for directions on finding them using the Android 
Market, or scan the barcodes in the margin using 
your Tab to download the apps quickly. (See the side­
bar, “Get thee a barcode–scanner app,” to get started.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 
AK Notepad
	
	 One program that the Galaxy Tab is missing out of the box is a notepad. A 
good choice for an app to fill that void is AK Notepad: You can type or dictate 
short messages and memos, which I find handy.
For example, before a recent visit to the hardware store, I made (dictated) a 
list of items I needed by using AK Notepad. I also keep some important items 
as notes — things that I often forget or don’t care to remember, such as fre­
quent flyer numbers, my dress shirt and suit size (like I ever need that info), 
and other important notes I might need handy but not cluttering my brain.
	
Perhaps the most important note you can make is one containing your 
contact information. A note labeled In Case You Find This Tablet on my Tab 
contains information about me in case I ever lose my gizmo and someone is 
decent enough to search it for my information. (Also see Chapter 22 for infor­
mation on finding a wayward Galaxy Tab.)
Angry Birds
	
	 The birds may be angry at the green piggies for stealing eggs, but you’ll be 
crazy for this addictive game. Like most popular games, Angry Birds is 
simple. It’s easy to learn, fun to play. The best part is that on the Galaxy Tab, 
with its awesome 10.1-inch display, the Angry Birds game is beautiful.
Gesture Search
	
	 The Gesture Search app provides a new way to find information on your 
Galaxy Tab. Rather than use a keyboard or dictate, you simply draw on the 
touchscreen the first letter of whatever you’re searching for.
Start the Gesture Search app to begin a search. Use your finger to draw a big 
letter on the screen. After you draw a letter, search results appear on the 
screen. You can continue drawing more letters to refine the search or touch 
a search result.
Gesture Search can find contacts, music, apps, and bookmarks in the 
Browser app.

 Chapter 24: Ten Great Apps
Google Finance
	
	 The Google Finance app is an excellent market-tracking tool for folks who are 
obsessed with the stock market or want to keep an eye on their portfolios. 
The app offers you an overview of the market and updates to your stocks as 
well as links to financial news.
To get the most from this app, configure Google Finance on the Web, using 
your computer. You can create lists of stocks to watch, which is then 
instantly synchronized with your Galaxy Tab. You can visit Google Finance 
on the Web at
www.google.com/finance
As with other Google services, Google Finance is provided to you for free, as 
part of your Google account.
Get thee a barcode-scanner app
Many apps from the Android Market can be 
quickly accessed by scanning their barcode 
information. Scanning with what? Why, your 
Galaxy Tab, of course!
By using a barcode-scanner app, you can 
instantly read in and translate barcodes into 
links to that app at the Android Market.
Plenty of barcode apps are out there, though 
I use one called Barcode Scanner. It’s easy: 
Run the app. Point the Tab’s camera at a bar­
code and, in a few moments, you see a link or 
an option for what to do next. To get an app, 
choose the Open Browser option, which opens 
the Android Market app right to that app’s page.
You can use the Barcode Scanner app to take 
advantage of the various QR code icons that 
appear in this chapter, as well as throughout 
this book. To install an app, choose the option 
Open Browser.

Google Sky Map
	
	 Ever look up into the night sky and say, “What the heck is that?” Unless it’s a 
bird, an airplane, a satellite, or a UFO, the Google Sky Map can help you find 
what it is. You may discover that a particularly bright star in the sky is, in 
fact, the planet Jupiter.
The Google Sky Map app is elegant. It basically turns the Galaxy Tab into a 
window you can look through to identify things in the night sky. Just start the 
app and hold the Galaxy Tab up to the sky. Pan the Tab to identify planets, 
stars, and constellations.
	
Google Sky Map promotes using the Galaxy Tab without touching it. For this 
reason, the screen goes blank after a spell, which is merely the Tab’s power-
saving mode. If you plan extensive stargazing with the Google Sky Map, 
consider resetting the screen timeout. Refer to Chapter 2 for information 
on this topic.
Movies
	
	 The Movies app is the Galaxy Tab’s gateway to Hollywood. It lists currently 
running films and films that are opening, and it has links to your local the­
aters with showtimes and other information. The app is also tied into the 
popular Rotten Tomatoes website for reviews and feedback. If you enjoy 
going to the movies, you’ll find the Movies app a valuable addition to your 
Galaxy Tab’s app library.
SportsTap
	
	 I admit to not being a sports nut, so it’s difficult for me to identify with the 
craving to have the latest scores, news, and schedules. The sports nuts in my 
life, however, tell me that the very best app for that purpose is a handy thing 
named SportsTap.
Rather than blather on about something I’m not into, just take my advice and 
obtain SportsTap. I believe you’ll be thrilled.

305
 Chapter 24: Ten Great Apps
TuneIn Radio
	
	 I know I mentioned this app back in Chapter 13, but I really do recommend it. 
One of my favorite ways that the Galaxy Tab entertains me is as a little radio I 
keep by my workstation. I use the TuneIn Radio app to find a favorite Internet 
radio station, and then I sit back and work.
While TuneIn Radio is playing, you can do other things with your Tab, such 
as check Facebook or answer an e-mail. You can return to the TuneIn Radio 
app by choosing the triangle notification icon. Or just keep it going and enjoy 
the tunes.
Voice Recorder
	
	 The Galaxy Tab can record your voice or other sounds, and the Voice 
Recorder is a good app for performing this task. It has an elegant and simple 
interface: Touch the big Record button to start recording. Make a note for 
yourself or record a friend doing his Daffy Duck impression.
Avoiding Android viruses
How can you tell which apps are legitimate and 
which might be viruses or evil apps that do odd 
things to your phone? Well, you can’t. In fact, 
most people can’t, because most evil apps don’t 
advertise themselves as such.
The key to knowing whether an app is evil is to 
look at what it does, as described in Chapter 16. 
If a simple grocery-list app uses the phone’s 
text messaging service and the app doesn’t 
need to send text messages, it’s suspect.
In the history of the Android operating system, 
only a handful of malicious apps have been dis­
tributed, and most of them were found in Asia. 
Google routinely removes these apps from the 
Android Market, and a feature of the Android 
operating system even lets Google remove apps 
from your tablet. So, you’re pretty safe.
Generally speaking, avoid “hacker” apps and 
porn and apps that use social engineering to 
make you do things on your Galaxy Tab that you 
wouldn’t otherwise do, such as text an over­
seas number to see racy pictures of politicians 
or celebrities.
Also, I highly recommend that you abstain from 
obtaining apps from anything but the official 
Android Market. The Amazon Market is okay, 
but some other markets are basically distribu­
tion points for illegal or infected software. Avoid 
them.

Previous recordings are stored in a list on the Voice Recorder’s main screen. 
Each recording is shown with its title, the date and time of the recording, and 
the recording duration.
Zedge
	
	 The Zedge program is a helpful resource for finding wallpapers and 
ringtones — millions of them. It’s a sharing app, so you can access wall­
papers and ringtones created by other Android users as well as share your 
own. If you’re looking for a specific sound or something special for Home 
screen wallpaper, Zedge is the best place to start your search.
