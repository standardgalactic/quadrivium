Introduction
C
ustomers love and cherish companies that treat them the way they want
to be treated. They’ll even pay more to get good service. Just look at
these survey statistics that prove the point:
 Customers spend up to 10 percent more for the same product with
better service.
 A customer will tell anywhere from 9 to 12 people when he or she gets
good service.
 When that customer receives poor service, he or she will tell up to 
20 people!
So, how well you communicate and establish a relationship with your cus-
tomers is the essence of customer service. This relationship doesn’t have to
take a long time — it can often happen in an instant. For example, your cus-
tomers will feel more recognized (and thus more connected) if they’re
greeted with smiles and are addressed by name. Simple actions such as these
keep customers coming back for more.
It certainly pays to please!
About This Book
Customer Service For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is a down-to-earth, step-by-step
guide that takes the mystery out of providing the best possible service to
your customers. This book is filled with hot tips and techniques and lots of
suggestions for giving your customers the kind of service that you would like
to receive.
We’ve packed this book with lots of practical advice for getting through the
everyday challenges at work. We show you how to keep your sanity when an
angry customer is calling you (and your mother) unflattering names over the
phone; how to manage and develop your staff so they can become service
heroes to their customers; and how to implement tried-and-true techniques
for achieving gold-level service at bronze-level cost.

For you business owners and entrepreneurs who want to build empires, we
provide a blueprint that’ll help you take over the world, or at least improve
your market share. In fact, we’ve made it as easy as 1-2-3, with a specific and
detailed service strategy that makes any company, large or small, more 
customer-oriented.
Finally, because the Internet has become such an integral part of business
and of our everyday lives, we’ve included an entire part devoted to improv-
ing your online customer service. Here you find info on writing effective
e-mails, creating a customer-friendly Web site, and using the latest in cus-
tomer service software and Customer Relations Management (CRM).
Conventions Used in This Book
We’ve used a few conventions in this book that we want you to be aware of:
 Anytime we introduce a new term, we italicize it and then define it.
 Keywords appear in boldface.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them stand
out in the text.
 When we use the word “customer,” we mean not only people who pur-
chase items from your company, but also co-workers, clients, and
anyone else you have dealings with.
What You’re Not to Read
This book is chock-full of useful information, and we’d love for you to read
every word we’ve written. However, if you’re pressed for time (or perhaps
you have the Driver working style discussed in Chapter 12) and just want the
bare-bones necessary info, you can skip the following:
 Sidebars: These gray-shaded boxes contain interesting yet unessential
material.
 Anecdotes: Any paragraphs that have the anecdote icon provide you
with our own personal experiences. You can certainly benefit from our
experience, but you can get by without it.

Customer Service For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Foolish Assumptions
If you’ve picked up this book, we can assume a few things about you. You
probably fit (more or less) into one of the following categories:
 You’re an executive in charge of championing a service improvement
process within your company and are looking for guidelines, ideas, and
strategies for how to do this.
 You’re a human resources or training expert and have been assigned the
task of helping your organization, or a particular department within your
organization, to become more customer-focused.
 You’re a small business owner or entrepreneur and want to discover
ways to give your business a competitive advantage by becoming as 
service-oriented as possible.
 You’re a manager and want to improve your ability to coach and create a
more customer-focused environment so that your staff will be better
equipped to provide excellent customer service.
 You’re an individual service provider who loves her job, loves her cus-
tomers, and just wants to improve her skills at giving great service.
 You’re an individual service provider who is burnt out by his job and his
customers. You want to transform stress by finding out some new ideas
and techniques for dealing with difficult customers, co-workers, and 
situations.
How This Book Is Organized

pany winners in the service game. Right from the get-go, you discover the

Service Management

a manager, create a working blueprint for service improvement within your
department. You gain real insights into how to build teamwork, morale, and
accountability at all levels of your company.
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: 
Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs
Here we explore the seemingly little things — those simple actions that lead
to significant payoffs in customer satisfaction. We provide you with time-
tested techniques for dealing with people face-to-face and over the tele-
phone, and we cover a variety of important communication skills that you
can use every day at work and at home.
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going
Gets Rough
In this part, you find out how to reduce the effects of stress when dealing

cult situations into win-win ones.
Part V: Working in a Wired World:
Customer Service on the Web
Both corporate giants and emerging companies alike know that in today’s
world, technology is fundamental to running a successful business. Tools

Customer Service For Dummies, 3rd Edition

important enough to share with you.
If you’re a manager, you want to be on the lookout for this icon. Wherever

Where to Go from Here
As Julie Andrews sang in The Sound of Music, “Let’s start at the very begin-
ning!” Our recommendation is to begin your journey through this book by
finding out where your customer service skills stand right now. The self-
evaluation and company quiz in Part I will help you determine your personal,
company, and departmental levels of service.

Introduction

Once you know where home base is, you can go in any number of directions.
Here are some suggestions:
 If you’re hot to deal with those difficult customers, turn to Part IV, which
shows you how to soothe the savage beasts hiding in your customers.
 If you’re a manager, you may want to head for Part II to discover how
you can create the strongest environment for service excellence.
 If you’ve mastered brick and mortar customer service but feel chal-
lenged by the Internet, you can surf on over to Part V to learn how to
bring excellent customer service to your Web site and your other online
interactions.
 If you need to brush up on core customer service skills and you want to
learn some ways to create better rapport with both customers and co-
workers, take a gander at the information-packed Part III. Here you find
lots of specifics about making and keeping customers for life by using
your tone of voice and body language to complement your words.
Even though this book gives great ideas for improving the service you offer
your customers, you must have three basic elements in place in order for
those ideas to take root and flourish. Smiling and saying please and thank
you are important, but alone they don’t lead to good service. You must have
the following elements in place, even if they aren’t easy (if they were so easy,
everyone would be doing them):
 Expand your definition of service to go beyond saying “yes” or “no” to
fulfilling a multitude of customer needs.
 Reconsider who your customers are and redefine excellent customer
service to include co-workers.
 Develop, as a company, a customer-friendly attitude both personally and
culturally.
If you hold the common idea that service is only giving customers what they
want, you’ll be in trouble every time a customer asks for something that is
impossible for you to provide. However, if you expand your definition of ser-
vice to include fulfilling the less obvious customer needs, you’ll never be in a
situation where you can’t provide your customers with some level of service.
Now, go ahead and get started improving your customer service!

Championing Customer Service
In This Chapter
 Sorting out old service principles and new practices
 Sticking to real customer-service values in person and online
 Evaluating how your level of service stacks up
I
n the old days, nobody wrote books about service. It was simply a way of
life. The pace of business was slower, and people had more time to talk
and listen to one another. Mr. and Mrs. Smith could go to their corner grocery
store to buy a pound of Muenster cheese and count on a warm welcome,
friendly service, and familiar faces.
Then came the Great Depression. Price, always an important factor, became
even more important, and life was about survival. Quality and service —
never high on Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs — disappeared from
everyday life and was reserved for the rich and famous. In the more prosper-
ous 1940s, consumers began to consider value in addition to price as part of
the service equation. By the 1960s, quality became important, with most cus-
tomers willing to pay more for higher quality products and services. The era
of convenience began in the 1970s with quick and easy foods, stores, banks,
and so on. Today, all of these characteristics have converged; consumers
want a competitive price, good value, convenience, and customer service —
and they want it yesterday!
In this chapter, we introduce you to the tools and core values you can use to
become a winner at providing good customer service. We even show you
how to implement and maintain personal service in the often impersonal
world of online business. Finally, to get you started on the right foot, we pro-
vide you with a short self-evaluating questionnaire, so you can determine
what level of service you’re currently achieving and what you can do to
improve.

Benefiting from the Evolution 
of Customer Service
Since the 1970s, a variety of business movements have influenced what
people know about making themselves and their companies customer
friendly. In this section (and throughout this book), we highlight the best,
time-tested ideas and show you how to make them work for your business.
Regardless of whether your business is large or small, domestic or interna-
tional, online or off, the ideas and strategies contained in this book can help
you use the wisdom of the past decades and current times to make your busi-
ness a winner at the service game now and into the future.
Total quality management
During the 1980s, customer service and quality improvement were the buzz-
words of the moment, and TQM (total quality management) became the most
popular acronym since BLT. TQM, which was implemented to enhance cus-
tomer service by delivering quality products, helped bring about modern
manufacturing techniques. The idea is that you can gain the edge over your
competitors by establishing optimal production processes, conforming to
standards, and empowering members of your staff to blow their whistles
when they spot any defects.
One of the most empowering tools to come out of the TQM movement is the
idea of quality groups or problem-solving teams. These are groups of people
who gather over a defined period of time (say once a week) to work on a spe-
cific problem. Using an agreed upon problem-solving method, they work to
determine the core causes of and best possible solutions for the problem. In
Chapter 9, we offer you a complete step-by-step process for using quality
groups in your own organization.
Moments of truth
On the heels of TQM’s moment of fame, Jan Carlzon, who was the CEO of SAS
Airlines, quietly published his book Moments of Truth (Ballinger Publishing
Company, 1987). It’s an account of how the airline, under Carlzon’s leadership,
asked what influenced its passengers’ perceptions of service. What the airline
found was that perceptions of service depended on how customers remem-
bered discrete encounters they had with the airline. These encounters — or
moments of truth — can be either memorably positive experiences or memo-
rably negative experiences. Each kind of encounter plays a critical part in an
10
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

individual customer’s future purchasing decisions. For example, a two-minute
phone conversation can influence a customer’s opinion about the entire
enterprise — even more so than a two-hour flight!
The moment-of-truth approach still lives on because its premise can be
applied to any business, large or small, and to any medium, such as voice
mail, e-mail, and so on. The moment-of-truth method of thinking about cus-
tomer service still holds up, because no matter what service or product you
provide, your customers are, more than ever, making quick judgments based
on fleeting contacts. Even though the quick judgment of your organization by
customers may not seem fair, it, nevertheless, is customer logic.
For example: Imagine that a customer receives an e-mail from your company
that has no greeting and sports several spelling mistakes. The sloppiness and
carelessness of the e-mail, for many customers, can signify that your staff
members aren’t professional, your company doesn’t care, and the quality of
your product is questionable — and nobody wants that!
Customer perception is reality, and service excellence, to a large degree, is
managing your customers’ perceptions and expectations. In Chapter 7, we
show you how you can determine and enhance your company’s most signifi-
cant moments of truth.
Sharing the market
Flash forward to the ’90s, and share of market became the hot button in busi-
ness/customer relations. Around this time, the speed of business began to
increase exponentially. Fax machines, overnight delivery, and the Internet
were beginning to present new customer-communication opportunities.
E-mail soon joined the established channels of communication like the
phone, regular mail, and the fax machine.
As technology advances by leaps and bounds, more and more magazine arti-
cles and business books are devoted to the new idea of developing deeper
relationships with customers. Viewing each sale as a transaction is short-
sighted. Customers are, after all, a finite commodity. Instead, you need to use
every customer touch-point as an opportunity to establish a dialogue and
create customer loyalty. Doing so makes sense, because acquiring a new cus-
tomer after all costs five times more than keeping a current one — so why
not increase efforts to retain established customers?
By listening to your customers and providing them with the services and
products they really want, you can gain and keep your share of the market.
Check out Part III of Customer Service For Dummies for simple, yet highly
effective strategies you can put in place to keep your customers happy and
coming back for more.

Chapter 1: Championing Customer Service

In-focused versus customer-focused
Nowadays, quantity is being replaced by quality. Every interaction with a cus-
tomer or potential customer is an opportunity for gathering feedback, search-
ing out needs, and implementing changes that can make your organization
more customer centric. For service champions, the idea of converting trans-
action buyers (customers whose sole purchasing criterion is price and who
have no vendor loyalty) into relationship buyers (those who value a long-term
vendor partnership) is possibly the most important service development
since Carlzon’s moments of truth.
Simply put, a customer-focused company is one that listens to the needs of
its customers and then does whatever it can to satisfy those needs. In-
focused organizations care little about the needs of their customers and
focus on what is convenient and expedient to them. Because customer-
focused companies have more respect for and more understanding of their
customers, they foster more customer loyalty, garner more positive word-of-
mouth from their customer base, and enjoy a high level of service initiative
from their staff. Part I of this book tells you everything you need to know
about how to transform your organization from in-focused to customer
focused.
CRM: The latest and greatest 
in customer service
CRM (customer relationship management) is the acronym that customer-
service professionals are using today. CRM is simply the marriage of process
and technology for tracking every contact point that customers have with
your organization.
Many companies believe that the CRM strategy is the digital key to becoming
customer centric in a fast-paced world. For small- or medium-sized enterprises,
CRM can smack of hype or be too confusing to really understand. However, if
you dig deep enough, valuable lessons can be learned from CRM — lessons
that can improve your bottom line, such as discovering specific and often
unspoken customer needs that enhance both loyalty and sales.
Head to Chapter 21 for a complete discussion of CRM. We tell you what to
take from CRM and what to leave behind. We extract and simplify the key 
elements so you can move beyond the acronym-of-the month to the real, 
cutting-edge issues. New technology presents new opportunities and new
challenges that will, no doubt, impact your business’s ability to provide 
great customer service in the years ahead.
12
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

We’re not suggesting that you ignore changing markets or new ways of serving
them. We simply believe that embracing today’s latest and greatest doesn’t
mean waving goodbye to everything useful from the past and forgetting every-
thing you already know about making customers happy.
Standing for Real Values — 
Even in the Virtual World
If you look through the shelves of your local bookstore or search for the key-
words “customer service” on your favorite bookseller’s Web site, you’ll find a
long list of titles to choose from, including the one you’re now reading! The
books spell out customer-service strategies for making it in today’s high-tech
world. However, service strategies — like the seasons — come and go.
Ultimately, the success of your enterprise has more to do with your core
values (and a commitment to delivering them) than it does with the latest
and greatest business trends.
Amid the hubbub caused by new and better technology, businesses that dif-
ferentiate themselves as customer centric are the ones that will see online
service as an exciting opportunity for delivering their existing values of ser-
vice, quality, and excellence to a wider group of customers. The root of these
values is a genuine customer-care attitude that compels companies to create
a feeling of closeness with their customers and use technology to design sys-
tems with their customers’ concerns and convenience in mind. Even in this
fast-paced, technology-driven world, the timeless aspects of human relations
still apply.
Valuing customer loyalty
Numerous studies highlight one key to business success: developing cus-
tomer loyalty. When it comes to e-commerce, the cost of enticing customers
to use your online service is expensive at the front end and light at the back
end. In other words, the longer you keep your e-customers and the more
loyal they are, the more lucrative they become!
Placing a greater emphasis on customer loyalty isn’t a new phenomenon —
even though many books and magazines seem to trumpet loyalty as though it
were a recent innovation. Adapting your customer satisfaction efforts to a
digital world is easier when your company already values customer loyalty
and has experience creating it.
13
Chapter 1: Championing Customer Service

Building relationships
Many years ago, service gurus counseled senior executives to create customer-
centric organizations. Becoming customer centric often meant moving away
from an intense focus on product development to placing an equal amount of
emphasis on relationship development. After all, even great products fail occa-
sionally, and a strong bond between company and customer can overcome
most problems.
If you’re a business owner today, you still need to develop trusting relation-
ships with your customers. The differences between today’s business world
and the business world of the past are the tools that you have at your dis-
posal. A courteous voice on the telephone and a friendly face across the
counter still are important; they’re just so expensive nowadays that they
have to be rationed. Replacing these luxuries are software and hardware that
can be as rewarding to your customers as they are to your company’s bottom
line when they’re designed, integrated, and used with a focus on customer
service.
Staying close to your customers
Customers rarely describe doing business over the Internet as a warm and
fuzzy experience. The absence of face time is, for many, the downside of
today’s Internet-heavy service environment. And yet, never before have busi-
nesses had the opportunity to be in such close and direct contact with their
customers. The Internet enables your company to be in direct communica-
tion with all of your customers — regardless of where they reside on the
planet — as long as they have an Internet connection.
You can assess individual customers’ needs, apologize, say thank you, ask for
input, and suggest new products or services suited to each one of them rather
than to an entire demographic group — all online. Think of the Internet as a
direct line to your customers and a new, exciting opportunity for any com-
pany that knows the value of listening and staying close to its customers.
Making it personal
In a wired world, your company must find ways to communicate a caring 
attitude through computer screens and digital technology. The field of 
e-business technology uses sophisticated software programs to track inven-
tory, accept payments, trace deliveries, predict customer needs, and send
thank-you notes. In short, it attempts to automate the personal touch — thus
making the most efficient use of your human resources by minimizing human
interaction. At the same time, e-business technology offers fast, convenient,
and personalized service.
14
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

Ultimately, though, investing in e-business software solutions doesn’t 
guarantee the personal touch — people like doing business with people. That
doesn’t mean that customers don’t like quickness and convenience; they
obviously do. But they also crave a human who can help them when they
have a question or concern that doesn’t fit into the templates of an online
help desk. Best-in-class companies demonstrate their caring attitudes by
using technology to support their relationships with people. They don’t use
technology to replace human relationships, but rather only to enhance them.
Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Taking 
an Honest Look at Your Service
Remember when you were a kid and your parents took you to see Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs for the first time? Snow White’s evil stepmother stood
in front of her mirror and asked, “Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest
of them all?” Even though you were only a kid, you knew that if that mirror
was smart, only one answer could be right: “You, my queen, are the fairest in
the land.”
Unlike the wicked queen — who had a hard time facing reality — your sur-
vival in today’s business world depends on you telling the truth about your
strengths and weaknesses as a service provider. After all, you have to know
where you are before you can move forward. To that end, we provide you
with a paper mirror — a questionnaire highlighting key service criteria that
mark individuals who are service winners.
Taking this evaluation can help you discover the quality of service you pro-
vide as an individual and give you a good place from which to start improving.
Congratulations, you and your company are on the way to being service stars!
Self-evaluation questionnaire
Use the following ten questions to find out whether you’re delivering bronze-,
silver-, or gold-level customer service. Stepping back and objectively assess-
ing yourself helps you determine your personal service strengths and shows
where you may need to devote some extra attention.
Use the following numbers to rate your response to each question.
0 = Rarely
1 = Sometimes
2 = Often
3 = Almost always

Chapter 1: Championing Customer Service

___ When having a conversation with a customer, do I give him or her my
complete attention and avoid doing other activities (working on the
computer, writing unnecessarily, doing a crossword puzzle, and so on)?
___ Do I make eye contact when speaking with a customer to show that I am
paying attention?
___ When speaking to a customer over the phone, do I make an effort to use
inflection in my voice to convey interest and concern?
___ Do I pick up the telephone by the third ring?
___ When I need to put a customer on hold, do I ask his or her permission
and wait for a response before doing so?
___ Do I avoid technical jargon and use language that the customer can
understand?
___ When I cannot provide my customer with exactly what he or she wants,
do I suggest options and alternatives?
___ Do I sincerely apologize to the customer when a mistake has been made
by me or my company?
___ When a customer is voicing a complaint, do I remain calm and under-
standing — even if I think he or she is wrong?
___ Do I view customer complaints as an opportunity to improve service
rather than as a problem that is taking up valuable time?
___ Total score
So, how’s your service?
Add together the scores you gave to all ten questions and then look below to
see how you did. If you scored:
 0-12 points: You’re at the bronze level.
 13-22 points: You’re at the silver level.
 23-30 points: You’re at the gold level.
For specifics about what your score means and where to go from here, find the
description of the level you achieved in the sections that follow and read on.
Bronze level
Scoring at this level doesn’t mean that you don’t care about your customers.
We find that a score in the bronze level is caused by one of the following
three reasons:
16
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

 You’re a newcomer to the service field and are still discovering the ins
and outs of dealing with customers. If this statement applies to you, then
using the information in this book can help bring you up to the silver
level and higher.
 You’re a seasoned service provider, but you may have become a little
rusty on some of the basics that you once practiced. Refresh yourself on
the basics by attending a customer-service training program.
 The last reason has to do with job suitability. Through the years, we’ve
met certain people who just don’t enjoy dealing with customers or help-
ing others solve problems. Nothing is wrong with them; they just work
better by themselves. If this situation applies to you, you may want to
consider changing jobs or changing the focus of the job you’re now in.
Silver level
You have a solid understanding of the basics, but you’re not using them con-
sistently. The probable reason for your inconsistency is that you’re over-
whelmed by the functions of your job. On good days, you give good service,
and on bad days, you give bad service. The key is to become more consis-
tent. Remember that regardless of the time you spend with a customer (be it
a 30-second phone call or a one-hour meeting) and regardless of how busy
you are, you always have a personal choice about the attitude you project. It
takes about 30 days to form a new habit, so make a point of practicing the
items covered by the questionnaire every time you deal with a customer —
especially when you don’t feel like it.
Gold level
Congratulations! You’re a professional at providing service. You seem to have
a firm understanding of the basics and are ready for bigger and better chal-
lenges. To continue to grow, consider the following suggestions:
 After you’ve finished evaluating yourself, get another perspective by
having a co-worker you know and trust evaluate you. He or she may see
areas for improvement that are blind spots to you.
 Go beyond the basics of service. Educate yourself in the more sophisti-
cated service skills by learning to take initiative (see Chapter 7).
We suggest that you go through this questionnaire a second time and replace
the word customer with the words staff member. Doing so can help you evalu-
ate how well you’re treating members of your staff as customers.

In-Focused or Customer-Focused:
Where Do You Stand?

 Identifying the two common threads of a service attitude
 Revisiting the definition of a customer
 Measuring how customer-focused your company is
R
egardless of whether your company is large or small, local or interna-
tional, in the manufacturing, technology, service, or public sector, the
key to successful customer relations is infusing your company to the core
with the principles of quality customer service. As a manager, executive, or
business owner, you have to deliver first-rate service to your customers,
instill a commitment to service in every person who works for you, and strive
to create a customer-centered company culture. The path to excellence in
customer service isn’t simply a matter of hiring the right people and training
the front-line staff, it’s a genuine commitment to create a customer-focused
rather than an in-focused company.
In this chapter, we compare the in-focused company with the customer-
focused one, and then we show you how to evaluate just how customer-
focused your company currently is. After you get a clearer picture of where
your company currently stands, you can read the rest of Part I where we pro-
vide you with a strategic outline and specific activities that help your com-
pany become more customer focused.
The In-Focused Company
If the companies we refer to as in-focused were people, you’d probably be
inclined to call them selfish, because their main concern is pleasing them-
selves rather than their customers. In-focused companies are fixated on
achieving internal goals that benefit the company, such as cutting costs, earn-
ing profits, and budgeting, but customer-satisfaction goals are either low on
the list or may even be nonexistent (see Figure 2-1). Some typical qualities
that identify an in-focused company are

 Recognition usually isn’t given to the staff members who provide good
service but rather to those who excel at accomplishing internal com-
pany goals.
 Staff members must focus most of their efforts on making their man-
agers, rather than their customers, happy.
 Promotion is based on seniority and favoritism rather than on merit.
 Staff members, if trained at all, are trained in the functions of the job but
rarely in communication and interpersonal skills.
 Departments that don’t deal directly with the external customer don’t
see themselves as responsible for customer satisfaction.
 Decisions that affect the customer are made at the top (behind closed
doors) and then pushed down without consulting the front line.
 Short-term, bottom-line fixes always win out over long-term solutions.

A customer-focused company, on the other hand, has one eye on profits and
the other eye on how best to serve its customers. This company has discov-
ered that profits and market share are the products of listening to customers
and acting upon their needs (see Figure 2-2).

Chapter 2: In-Focused or Customer-Focused: Where Do You Stand?
In-focused from the top down
A company we know had received dozens of
complaints about how discourteously its corpo-
rate headquarters handled telephone calls. In
response, senior management asked the com-
pany’s human resources department to design
and present a two-hour training seminar on
customer service to resolve the problem. The
HR department did so and invited all the upper
management to attend, since they were some
of the worst offenders. The indignant response
of the higher ups was that they didn’t have time
to attend such a program and that the lower
ranks were the ones who needed the training
anyway — not them. The training program was
held, with junior staff in attendance. However,
the lack of clear management support and par-
ticipation left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth,
and created an attitude of ‘this is not really that
important’. The moral of the story is that service
excellence starts at the top. If you don’t have
the right attitude at the top, don’t expect it from
your front line.

Qualities that characterize a customer-focused organization are
 Recognition is earned by staff members who balance job efficiency with
customer satisfaction.
 Managers focus on supporting their staff members in doing their jobs well
so that they can focus more attention on taking care of customer needs.
 Promotion is based on good service skills and on seniority.
 Training the staff is a high priority, focusing on technical and interper-
sonal skills.
 All staff members know who their customers are (external and internal —
see the “Reconsidering Who Your Customers Are” section later in this
chapter) and understand how they’re part of the customer-service chain.
 A participative management style is common throughout the company,
and staff members have opportunities to offer feedback on key customer
issues before decisions are made.
 Long-term thinking is the rule rather than the exception.
Three Basic Elements 
of Service Excellence
This book gives you hundreds of great ideas for how to create a customer-
focused culture and improve the service you offer your customers. However,
you first must gain an understanding of the three basic elements of service
excellence for those hundreds of ideas to take root and flourish. Otherwise,

Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 
A real-life customer-focused company
One of our clients, an international hotel chain
has made being customer-focused a way of life.
This company has put a system in place that
makes it clear to all managers and staff that
customer excellence is a top priority. They do
quarterly guest tracking to monitor customer
satisfaction. The results are then forwarded 
to the general managers at each location.
Information, such as how one hotel site 
compares with the others in the same region
and specific information on each department
(front desk, check out, restaurant, and so on), is
made available. Management bonuses are
based on these guest-tracking results, and a
yearly achievement forum acknowledges staff
members and locations whose guest-tracking
scores are the highest.

no amount of smiling, saying please and thank you, or customer-loyalty pro-
grams will help your company develop good service. The three basics are
 Developing a customer-friendly attitude.
 Expanding your definition of service.
 Reconsidering who your customers are.
You may find yourself looking at these basics and thinking, “That’s no big
deal. These ideas are obviously from Business 101.” But beware, looks can be
deceiving. Although these elements may seem obvious, they’re not necessar-
ily easy to accomplish. If they were, everyone would be using them. The dif-
ference between knowing them and living them takes commitment and
practice. Check out the three sections that follow as we discuss these ele-
ments in detail and show you how to apply them to your business.
Developing a Customer-Friendly Attitude
All companies and individuals who provide great service have a genuine 
customer-friendly attitude in common. By customer-friendly attitude, we
mean they view their customers as the most important part of their jobs and
have a sincere appreciation for the way their customers do business with
them. We don’t mean viewing your customers as interruptions to your work
routine for which you have to paste on a false smile, all the while wishing
they’d just leave so you can get on with your work. For you and your staff to
be able to understand how to create a customer-friendly attitude, you all
need to step back and take a look at what you do during the workday.
Imagine a busy Monday morning at the office when suddenly Oprah Winfrey
shows up and announces she’s doing a special on “A Day In The Life Of The
American Worker,” and she wants to follow you around with a camera for an
entire day, videotaping everything you do (with the exception of a few per-
sonal moments). At the end of the day, Oprah invites you to view the tape. As
you watch, you notice that you’re resourceful under pressure, productive,
efficient, and good looking. That’s probably the reason they picked you.
However, seeing yourself on the video confirmed your suspicions: A day at
work is rather like a trip down a raging river. After you walk in, everything
switches into high gear and is a crazy and fast-moving whirl of doing this,
that, and the other thing until you leave for the day. The tape demonstrates
how surrounded and submerged you are by ringing telephones to answer,
e-mails to read and write, paperwork to process, meetings to attend, prob-
lems to solve, fires to put out, and so on. (We, of course, recommend that you
show the video to your boss, point out all that you do, and ask for a raise. If
you’re self-employed, take yourself out to dinner — you deserve it!)
23
Chapter 2: In-Focused or Customer-Focused: Where Do You Stand?

Communicating and establishing 
relationships: Two common threads
The incessant tasks that make up your day are the functions of your job.
Thinking that all the paperwork, e-mails, memos, and meetings are the whole
story is tempting, but if you look a little deeper, you find two common
threads that link together the fabric of everything you do at work, regardless
of whether you’re a plumber, a teacher, or an IRS auditor.
The first common thread is communicating with other people. Although
plumbers may spend most of their day alone under a sink with only a wrench
for company, their communication skills are what count when they explain to
you what the problem is and what it will cost to fix it. A teacher’s ability to
make a subject utterly fascinating or boring has a great deal to do with the
way he or she talks about it. Even the IRS has instituted customer communi-
cation improvement programs during the past few years! The bottom line is
that everyone, regardless of whether they work alone or in a group, uses
some form of communication to get their jobs done.
Communication isn’t just about talking. It’s also body language, writing, and,
in today’s world, online interaction. Part III of Customer Service Excellence For
Dummies offers you some valuable techniques for enhancing your communi-
cation skills.
The second common thread of the workplace routine is establishing relation-
ships with other people. Relationship usually refers to a personal connection,
such as a friend, spouse, or family member. However, in the service game, we
use the word relationship to mean connecting with another person to accom-
plish something. Go back under the sink and visit with your seemingly soli-
tary plumber and you’ll discover that he or she has relationships with
24
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 
It pays to please
Customers love and cherish companies that
treat them the way they’d like to be treated. In
fact, some consumers will even pay more to
obtain those kinds of services. Here are some
survey statistics proving the point:
 Consumers spend up to 10 percent more for
the same product with better service.
 When consumers receive good service,
they tell an average of 9 to 12 other people
about it.
 When consumers receive poor service,
they tell up to 20 people about it.
 The likelihood that customers will repur-
chase from or patronize a company when-
ever their complaints are handled quickly
and pleasantly is 82 percent.
 When service is poor, 91 percent of retail
customers refuse to go back to a store.

customers, vendors, and fellow plumbers. The same applies to the school-
teacher, who not only has relationships with the students but also with their
parents, fellow teachers, and school administrators. IRS auditors likewise
have relationships with tax accountants, citizens, and the United States
Government. (Now that’s a lot of relationships.)
Although your job has many functions, communicating and establishing rela-
tionships are at its essence. At a department store, for example, a sales assis-
tant may have many tasks to complete, such as stocking, merchandising, and
running the register, but the essence of his or her job is keeping customers
happy and coming back. As a customer, you feel more recognized — and con-
sequently more connected — whenever the sales assistant takes the time to
smile at you and call you by your name when handing your credit card back
to you.
On the other hand, a bad impression can develop just as fast. When you call a
company on the phone, and the telephone rings ten times before someone
answers it, what kind of bond has that company established with you? More
than likely, the poor response created a negative relationship before any busi-
ness ever was transacted.
Create positive moments of truth
These brief actions or instant connections are what Jan Carlzon (the former
President of SAS Airlines) calls moments of truth. A moment of truth occurs
whenever a customer comes in contact with your company and forms either
a negative or positive memorable impression. These moments of truth usu-
ally take no longer than 20 seconds, but have a lasting impact on a cus-
tomer’s perception of the service your company offers.
Imagine a prospective customer coming to see you and walking up to the
receptionist in your office and telling him that she’s here for her 2 o’clock
appointment with you. The receptionist (a temp you just hired) is busy doing
e-mail and doesn’t respond or look up for several seconds. When he finally
looks up and speaks, his go-ahead-make-my-day expression and get-out-of-
my-face tone form a brief but off-putting negative moment of truth for your
potential customer. The problem doesn’t end there, however. The negative
impression your customer has of the receptionist is unwittingly applied to
the rest of your company (including you). Okay, so we know it isn’t fair, but it
is after all the way customers think. We call this type of thinking customer
logic — the logic being that the one equals the many.
Next imagine the opposite situation. Your customer walks in, and the recep-
tionist immediately looks up, greets her with a smile, and says, “Good morn-
ing. How may I help you?” When the customer asks for you, the receptionist
tells her you’ll just be a moment and offers her a comfortable chair and a cup
of coffee or tea. A positive moment of truth like this puts the customer on
your side and paves the way for a successful meeting.
25
Chapter 2: In-Focused or Customer-Focused: Where Do You Stand?

For a great story about how one company became a service winner, read
Moments Of Truth, by Jan Carlzon (Perennial Library, Harper & Row). Even
though the book is written about the airline industry, we’ve never found a
business that couldn’t benefit from Carlzon’s advice.
Don’t put functions before essence
Creating positive moments of truth is easy when you’re not under pressure.
However, when you’re faced with having too much to do and too little time to
do it, you can get so caught up in your daily To Do list that it’s all too easy to
forget that the essence of your job is serving the customer.

Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 
Friendly is more efficient
We recently took a flight from San Francisco to
New York. While about 100 weary travelers
patiently waited for their luggage to appear on
the carousel, a voice came over the loud-
speaker and announced that a loading mix-up
in San Francisco meant the luggage (our lug-
gage) would arrive on the first flight the next
morning. Amid quiet moans and louder curses,
we were herded over to the lost-luggage area
and asked to form two lines. As we moved
closer to the front of our line, we became
painfully aware that the other line was moving
faster (don’t they always). We also observed
that the agent in the fast-moving line seemed
much more friendly, empathetic, and energetic
than the grumbling and resentful counterpart
who was taking care of our group.
The friendly agent was going out of her way to
be nice to disgruntled passengers. She smiled
and apologized, saying that she understood her
customers’ frustration and so on. The passen-
gers moved quickly through her line, apparently
satisfied that everything that could be done was
being done. At the head of our line, the story
wasn’t so pretty. We could tell that our agent
was upset, because she had a tortured expres-
sion on her face, a loud, cranky voice, and an
overall bad attitude. Her conversation was pep-
pered with phrases like: “What do you expect
me to be able to do about it?” “You’ll just have to
make do until the morning,” and the ever popu-
lar “The sooner you give me the information I
need, the sooner I’ll be able to help you.” We
started talking about how each of the agents
might talk to her family about her day at work.
We imagined the one with the customer-friendly
attitude saying, “We had a problem with lug-
gage on the San Francisco flight tonight, but
most of the passengers were understanding.”
But the other agent’s report would be more like,
“You won’t believe what a terrible evening I’ve
had. The passengers on the San Francisco flight
were a total pain in the neck about a problem
with their luggage, and I’m stressed out!” What
this agent failed to realize was that being
friendly to the customers would not have taken
any longer, but it would have been much less
stressful and more effective had she done so.

If you forget this principle, the customer suddenly becomes an inconve-
nience, and you project an attitude that the customer somehow is interrupt-
ing your job. That attitude is what leaves customers with the feeling they’re
unimportant to you and that the company has little or no regard for their
needs. Alternatively, when you create a customer-friendly attitude by viewing
the customer as the job, the customer feels valued by your company.
“I don’t have the time to create a relationship with every customer.” If we had
a dollar for every time we’ve heard this statement, we’d be writing this book
from the warm sands of our tropical beach vacation home. When you have a
customer-friendly attitude, you naturally develop a partnership with the
other person, and solving a problem with a partner takes much less time than
it does with someone who’s an adversary. In a survey that we conducted for
a client, we found that 98 percent of customer interactions were faster and
more efficient when the service provider took enough time to establish a rela-
tionship and create rapport with the customer.
Here are some clues that you may have slipped into the habit of viewing your
customers as interruptions of your job:
 Your shoulders hug your neck every time the phone rings.
 Switching on voice mail has become a reflex — even when you’re in the
office.
 Every customer or co-worker looks like he or she is out to get you.
 You enjoy saying, “No,” more and more.
 Every sentence you utter to a customer begins with a sigh.
Although your job functions are important, they never are more important
than the customers they were designed to serve.
Expanding Your Definition of Service
Your definition of service shapes every interaction you have with your cus-
tomers. If you hold the common belief that service is giving customers only
what they want, you may as well paint yourself into a corner every time a
customer asks for something that’s impossible for you to provide. If, on the
other hand, you expand your definition of service to include fulfilling the mul-
titude of less-obvious customer needs, you’ll never encounter a time when
you can’t provide your customers with at least some level of service.
By addressing less-obvious customer needs, such as listening with empathy
when customers have a problem or providing options and alternatives when
you can’t give customers exactly what they want, you widen the gap between
you and your competitors. You can find out more about these less-obvious
customer needs and how to fulfill them in Chapters 14 and 15.
27
Chapter 2: In-Focused or Customer-Focused: Where Do You Stand?

Customer service is not a department somewhere within your company.
Rather, it’s a company culture in which every individual at every level is 
customer-oriented.
Reconsidering Who Your Customers Are
Who are your customers? Do you really know? All too often businesses and
employees limit their definitions of a customer to someone who is outside of
the company. Look up the word “customer” in your dictionary. The first defin-
ition of customer is “a person who buys,” but the second definition is “a
person with whom one has dealings.”
In fact, everyone who works for a company has customers regardless of
whether they work with external, paying customers or internal co-workers.
The external customer
External customers are the people you deal with either face to face or over the
phone. They’re the ones who buy products or services from you — cus-
tomers in the traditional sense of the word. Without them, you’d have no
sales, no business, and worse yet, no paycheck. If your definition of a cus-
tomer stops here, however, you’re seeing only half the picture.
The internal customer
Internal customers are the other half of the picture. They’re the people who
work inside your company and rely on you for services, products, and infor-
mation they need to do their jobs. They’re not traditional customers, yet they
need the same tender, loving care that you give to external customers.
28
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 
Service has a feeling
Think of a company (restaurant, store, bank, and
so on) with which you enjoy doing business.
Why do you like being a customer there? 
Are customer-service representatives friendly,
courteous, and knowledgeable? Imagine for a
moment that you’re there right now. How do you
feel? Okay, now we’re going to transport you
instantly to a new location. You’re now standing
in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles
waiting to renew your driver’s license. How do
you feel now? If you don’t feel any different, you
may need psychiatric help!

By expanding your definition of a customer to include co-workers, you take a
vital step toward providing excellent service.
At work you play the dual-role of customer and service provider at different
times. For example, a co-worker may come up to you and ask for a printout of
a report. In that case, since you’re the one providing the service, information,
product, you’re the service provider. However, ten minutes later, you may
turn around and go to that same co-worker and ask for help with a project.
Now he’s the one providing the service, information, product, and you’re his
customer. In less than one hour, you’ve changed hats!
The customer chain
The relationship between internal customers and external customers forms
the customer chain. So, if you have a backroom kind of job where you rarely
see the light of day, let alone a living, breathing customer, you can easily
begin to feel that your work has little or no impact on external customers.
But if you look at the bigger picture, you can see that everyone in a company
plays some part in fulfilling the customers’ needs. Barely an hour goes by
during the day when you’re not providing something for somebody in some
form or another. Each interaction between internal customers is an important
link in a chain of events that always ends up at the external customers’ feet.

Chapter 2: In-Focused or Customer-Focused: Where Do You Stand?
Having an indirect effect
Many years ago, coauthor Keith Bailey worked
as a waiter in a restaurant. One of the cooks
was moody and had a bad habit of throwing
kitchen utensils at the wall on the far side of the
kitchen. The noise of clattering metal let all the
waiters know when the cook wasn’t a happy
camper and to beware! One day, Keith was
taking an order from two dinner patrons, and
one of them asked to substitute steamed veg-
etables for the French fries that usually accom-
panied such an order. As his smile congealed,
he immediately thought of the unhappy cook
and his desire to live. Eventually, Keith nervously
said, “I’m sure that’ll be no problem.” On the trip
back to the kitchen, he felt like he was walking
up the steps of the gallows. He poked his head
into the kitchen, quickly threw down the order
and left before the spoons started flying. As
Keith waited on his next table, he noticed that
the cook’s attitude had put a wet blanket on his
own enthusiasm. The cook’s job, as written on
his job description, was to prepare food. No
mention was made about how his dealings with
or attitude toward other employees might indi-
rectly affect the customers’ dining experience.

About two years ago, The Wall Street Journal ran an article titled, “Poorly
Treated Employees Treat the Customer Just as Poorly.” Boy, does that hit the
nail on the head. We’ve dealt with a frightening percentage of managers who
don’t realize that their staff members are internal customers. We’re con-
vinced that the quality of service that a company provides to its customers is
a direct reflection of how a company’s staff members are treated by their
managers. Viewing your staff members as customers is a priority. When you
see them as customers, you can then treat them accordingly. Doing so means
focusing not on what your staff can do to make your job easier, but rather on
what you can do to make their jobs easier.
Many companies seem to overlook an important link in the service chain —
their vendors. By using the techniques in this book with your vendors, you’ll
not only enhance your relationship with them, but you’ll also receive better
service. In our business, we know that we’re dealing with truly customer-
focused companies when they treat us as customers even though they are our
clients.

Breaking news: Staff members are customers
We once were invited to present our ideas
about providing service to senior executives at
a large and well-known manufacturing organi-
zation. They were puzzled about why surveys of
customers continually revealed one central
weakness: They were not service-oriented. We
began the meeting, and the executives became
less and less comfortable with the idea of treat-
ing co-workers and employees as customers.
During an afternoon break at this rapidly deteri-
orating meeting, a vice president of human
resources shuffled us into a darkened corner of
the boardroom and said with fear in his eyes,
“Are you trying to tell me that the way I treat my
staff has an effect on how they treat their cus-
tomers?” “Yes,” we said in unison. He shook his
head in dismay, lit his pipe, and wandered off
through his own smoke. We never were invited
back. Here was a group of educated, experi-
enced professionals apparently unaware of one
of the basics of excellent service: Treat your
staff like customers.

may want to gather together four or five of your co-workers and, as a group,
discuss the questions and reach a consensus on the score you give yourself
for each one. More often than not, the ensuing conversation — including
each person’s reasons for their ratings — proves to be as valuable as the
scores. In fact, many people view the survey as an opportunity to talk about
the state of the company’s customer service.
Before you begin
The 38 questions that follow are designed to be equally applicable to the
evaluation of an individual department or an entire company. Before you
begin, decide whether you’re focusing on a specific department or the com-
pany as a whole. Some general do’s and don’ts to keep in mind as you go
through the questionnaire include
 Do be honest and discerning in the ratings you give.
 Do go with your gut feeling when responding to each question.
 Do base your ratings on where things stand today.
 Don’t base your ratings on what you’re planning to do in the near future.
 Don’t base your ratings solely on other people’s opinions — although
building a consensus when working as a group is fine.
 Don’t overestimate where your company is.
Using the following rankings, consider each question separately and assign a
score that you think reflects where your company is today. Each question
needs to receive a score from 0 to 3, according to the following criteria:
0 = Not at all
1 = To a small degree
2 = To a moderate degree
3 = To a large degree
As you read the questions, you may find yourself thinking, “Aren’t these sub-
jective?” Well, of course they are! This questionnaire is designed to give you a
feel for where you stand today and to highlight some key areas for improve-
ment. This questionnaire is not meant to replace formal customer and staff
surveys that give you hard data about the way your customers and staff view
your company.

Scoring your responses and 
making improvements
Add your numbers up for all of the questions and get a total score. Look at
the list below to determine what stage your company or department cur-
rently is at with regard to being customer-focused.
 Level 1: Bean counting (0 to 26 points)
 Level 2: Posters, pins, and plaques (27 to 57 points)
 Level 3: Tiger by the tail (58 to 83 points)
 Level 4: Bull’s-eye (84 to 114 points)
You can find out more about the dangers and recommendations at each level
by reading on.
Level 1: Bean counting (0–26 points)
If your company or department scored in Level 1, the bean counters are run-
ning your company. Your organization probably views customer service as a
low priority and focuses most of its attention on financial goals and activities
that impact the bottom line, such as cost cutting, budgets, and so on.
Short-term results are considered more valuable than long-term gains, and
results are measured by quantity not by quality. At this level, pursuing finan-
cial gains to the exclusion of customer satisfaction is like jumping over a
dollar to get to a dime.
34
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

Danger: You won’t see the importance of customer service until it’s too late
and an emergency, such as lost accounts or reduced market share, forces you
to make customer service a higher priority. When your company gets to this
point, you often face the additional pressure of uncertainty regarding the
future, which makes improving service even more challenging. We have wit-
nessed the panicked look on the faces of people at our workshops who real-
ize that they needed to be paying attention to their service long before it
became an emergency.
Recommendation: Do something about service before it’s too late. Examine
how important customer service is to the overall, long-term success of your
business. You may want to begin by building your company’s awareness of
the importance of customer service by:
 Conducting a survey to measure current levels of customer satisfaction.
 Sending managers and staff to customer-service training.
 Gathering information that shows the effect providing poor service has
on your company.
Level 2: Posters, pins, and plaques (27–57 points)
The walls of your business tell the entire story. Having seen the light, man-
agement has put up posters, handed out pins, and designed plaques declar-
ing such popular platitudes as:
 The customer is job one.
 The customer is king.
 The customer is always right.
35
Chapter 2: In-Focused or Customer-Focused: Where Do You Stand?
Actions speak louder than words
A transportation company we know spent a
great deal of time telling its staff that customer
service was the future of its business. The prob-
lem: The staff had seen little action from man-
agement that demonstrated this commitment to
customer service. Executives eventually real-
ized that they needed to do something to prove
to their staff that they were serious about doing
whatever was necessary to improve service.
For years, staff and customers had complained
about how far one of the service buildings had
fallen into disrepair. It needed new carpet and
a coat of paint. In a move that surprised every-
one, executives refurbished the building. This
simple, low-cost, yet highly visible action said
more to the staff than anything else manage-
ment had done. This step was the beginning of
a service-improvement process that continues
to this day.

Management now is convinced of the importance of providing customer ser-
vice but has yet to make customer service a part of everyday business.
Management has begun promoting the ideas behind customer service and
probably has taken one or two highly visible actions to this end. At this level,
the attitude of the staff is: “This sounds good, but we’ll see whether manage-
ment follows through.”
Danger: Your company may get stuck in talk and theory but not go into real
changes, thus creating an attitude that customer service is just another pro-
gram of the month. If this issue is not resolved, skepticism among the staff
makes any future attempts at improving customer service more difficult.
Recommendation: Take a highly visible action that clearly demonstrates the
company’s commitment to customer service. Follow the advice from old
adages: “Put your money where your mouth is” and “Walk what you talk.”
Your staff probably will view the actions you take as a benefit to them or to
the customer. Something to think about: What customer-service problem can
you fix that your staff has been complaining about forever?
Level 3: Tiger by the tail (58–83 points)
You’ve grabbed a tiger by the tail! Good job! Even though you’re in the middle
of creative chaos and may feel as if you’re continually on the brink of being out
of control, your company is well on its way to customer-service excellence.
Your staff members are excited by all the positive changes and are cautiously
optimistic about the future. A feeling that “We still have a ways to go” perme-
ates throughout the company. Like a trip to the moon, you’ve achieved liftoff,
and it’s too late to go back but too soon to see exactly where you’re going.
Danger: You’ve opened Pandora’s Box, and all your company’s service weak-
nesses and problems are laid out before you. Now that you see all that needs
to be fixed, you may become overwhelmed and paralyzed, and you may, con-
sequently, throw in the towel before you’ve accomplished all that you want to.

Improvement takes time
A couple on TV has a show about how to
remodel houses. In one show, I watched them
put in a complete drainage system in three min-
utes. In the first 30 seconds, they showed how
to mark off the trench. In the next 60 seconds, a
backhoe arrived and began digging the ditch.
Effortlessly and without any mishaps, they next
installed the drainage pipes, all of which fit 
perfectly. Leaning on their shovels and wearing
protective eyewear, they wiped their brows and
moved on to replacing the roof! “This is fiction!”
I thought. Nobody I know would expect to go out
and redo his or her drains so effortlessly.
Neither should you expect to remodel a busi-
ness in record time — especially where cus-
tomer service is concerned.

Recommendation: Keep the big picture in mind, and don’t try to fix every-
thing all at once. Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day. One way to keep
your focus without losing your mind is to select one specific service problem
(not necessarily a big one) and completely resolve it before going on to the
next. If you follow this routine for six months, you’ll be amazed by how many
indirect problems also are solved. Just remember that the light is at the end
of the tunnel, but it isn’t the headlight of an oncoming train.
Level 4: Bull’s-eye! (84–114 points)
Congratulations! Your company makes service a way of life. You’ve created a
strong focus on customer satisfaction that influences the way managers and
staff members do their jobs every day. The service culture is so strong that it
has taken on a life of its own, and you see quick returns from the efforts you
put into service improvement. Your staff members see customer service as
an important part of the jobs they do, and they know that the company will
back them up in doing what it takes to please the customer.
Danger: When all systems are ready to go, becoming complacent is easy, and
you may get blindsided by the arrogance of success. In other words, don’t
read or believe your own press releases. At this level, the biggest danger is
the tendency to rest on your laurels, thinking that you’ve arrived.
Recommendation: Look for new ways to be innovative. Take a risk and do
something that hasn’t been done before in your company or industry. Ask
yourself: “How can we move our existing services to the next level?” The
president of a major airline put it this way: “Our job is to make our existing
services obsolete before our competitors do.”

Requiring an ongoing commitment
We had the privilege a few years ago of work-
ing with an international hotel chain that has 
a great reputation for service. In meetings 
with senior managers, we were continually
impressed by their appetite for continuously
improving service. Even though their customer
surveys showed they were doing an excellent
job, they still said things like:
 “We’re only as good as the guest’s last
visit.”
 “We want to continue to be the best.”
 “We can always improve.”
The ongoing commitment of these managers to
continued improvement is what sets them apart
from their competitors and continues to make
them winners in their field.

 Identifying six key ways to create a customer-centric organization
 Measuring the importance of your customers
 Becoming more customer centric
S
tanding face to face with the inevitable task of coming up with a plan for
improving service can be paralyzing. Many companies know that cus-
tomer service is important, and they genuinely want to improve the quality of
service they offer. Unfortunately, few realize that doing so requires develop-
ing an overall strategy that translates this desire into day-to-day reality.
One of the hardest lessons for business leaders to deal with is that neither
excellent product quality nor the latest, greatest technology is the cure for all
their customer relationship ills. Ultimately, the key to long-lasting customer
loyalty and retention is to go beyond the strategy of technological excellence
and embrace all the key strategic elements that can make your company a
winner at the service game.
In this chapter, you’ll explore the six key areas that your company must take
action on in order to achieve a true customer focus. These areas are time-
tested and are at the core of what truly successfully companies do to make
their business a place where customer loyalty and satisfaction are paramount.
Six Key Strategies for Customer Service
Becoming customer-centric is a process that requires focus, effort, and action
in certain strategic areas. In this section, we discuss each of these six key
strategic areas and show you how to implement them.

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that developing a strategy and taking
action in only one of these six essential areas can do the trick — because it
won’t. We’ve seen countless companies try to shortcut this process by just
doing the training or putting the extra service blurbs into the company
newsletter. Although these aren’t bad actions to take, they can’t stand alone.
If you’re committed to making your company more customer-focused, then
by default you’re also committed to changing your company’s culture. Doing
so requires a willingness to reevaluate and even redesign how you do busi-
ness. No shortcuts are available. If there were, then everyone would be using
the same shortcuts, and no shortage of good service would exist. Moreover,
you wouldn’t be able to create the service advantage that leaves your com-
petitors eating your dust!

Fish stinks from the head down
An old Dutch adage says, “Fish stinks from the
head down.” We gained firsthand experience of
this sage wisdom when we were invited to pre-
sent our ideas on how to create a customer-
centric organization to the senior executives of
a large and well-known manufacturing com-
pany. The execs had just completed a $2 million,
two-year overhaul of their manufacturing capa-
bilities aimed at improving overall quality.
Although they were pleased with the progress
they’d made — especially in product quality —
they were scratching their heads in wonder-
ment about the results of their most recent cus-
tomer and employee surveys. Despite their
efforts, they still were getting relatively low
scores when it came to the company’s overall
responsiveness to customer and staff problems
and concerns. They asked us to meet with them
to help figure out why and strategize a plan to
address the problem.
As soon as the meeting started, it became
apparent that the president and his senior man-
agement team were uncomfortable with our
core beliefs on what it takes to create a cus-
tomer-centric organization. At almost every
turn, they took issue with the guiding principles
of a customer-centric organization. They were
ambivalent about modeling service from the top
down, making meaningful use of feedback, edu-
cating every person about quality service, set-
ting service standards, and recognizing
employee service excellence. (Rest assured: All
these principles are explored in detail in this
book.)
Realizing that we needed to give them a bit of
time to digest what we were saying, we took a
break. During the break, one of the senior vice
presidents shuffled us into a dark corner of the
boardroom. He said, with fear in his eyes, “Are
you trying to tell me that the way I treat my staff
has an effect on how they treat their cus-
tomers?” “Yes,” we said, relieved that our mes-
sage had, at last, gotten through to one person.
Unfortunately, we were mistaken. In disgust, he
shook his head, lit his pipe, and wandered off
through a billowing cloud of smoke.
As the meeting went on, it became crystal clear
to us why this company had the problems it did.
The final straw came when we boldly (in their
opinion) dared to put forth the idea that there
might be a direct connection between their
survey results and their lack of focus on the
quality of service the customers received. The
body language of the group said, unmistakably,
“Heretics!” The day eventually ended. Much to
our relief, the company didn’t call us again.

Taking a top-down approach
Most business owners, executives, and senior managers, when asked, nod
their heads in complete agreement that excellent customer relations are the
cornerstone of a successful business. In the final analysis, however, what
matters isn’t what they say, it’s what they do. A manager’s actions can greatly
enhance the staff’s commitment to providing improved service.
Many managers express their commitment to service by taking a roll-up-your-
sleeves approach and modeling excellent service skills. Examples of this
approach include
 Executives at a well-known communications company who took com-
plaint calls in the customer-service department once a month. They
personally followed up on all the calls they answered until the issues
were resolved.
 Executives at a rental car company who took a trip every week on a
shuttle from the rental location to the airport terminal to speak with
passengers and get their impressions of the service the company
offered. Each of the executives brought back stories and suggestions to
their monthly management meetings.
 A general manager in a transportation company who started holding
informal lunch gatherings on a regular basis. The meetings gave
employees an opportunity to ask him questions and make comments or
suggestions related to improving the conditions at work and the quality
of the customer service they offered.
No quicker way exists for an executive to hinder a company’s progress
toward becoming customer centric than by promoting service excellence
with her words and expressing mediocrity with her actions — for example, a
senior manager who recommends service training for employees but refuses
to participate in the training herself.
Asking for feedback (and actually 
using it)
Many companies mistakenly assume that they know what their customers
want. One of the first and most important steps in becoming customer cen-
tric is taking steps to find out — rather than just assuming that you already
know — what your customers want and expect of you. You need to discover
whether you’re meeting, and hopefully exceeding, their expectations. You can
put your fingers on the pulse of your customers’ experience by conducting
surveys and forming focus groups. See Chapter 4 for specific details about
how to develop customer and staff surveys.
41
Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy

After you gather and analyze the data, be sure to close the loop by reporting
any appropriate findings back to the people you surveyed. At the conclusion
of the surveys, after you digest the feedback, you can get in touch with your
customers any number of ways, including:
 Sending a letter thanking your clients for their feedback, outlining your
major findings, and proposing the next steps.
 Sending an e-mail, no longer than three or four paragraphs, that summa-
rizes the findings from the report and highlights any actions you plan to
take.
 Inviting customers who participated in the survey to a meeting where
you present the overall survey results and conclusions.
As a byproduct of conducting the survey and sharing the results (good and
bad), your company can enjoy an enhanced image and greater prestige
among customers who played an active role in the evaluation process.
Gathering feedback from staff is another significant step in discovering where
you stand as a company. We often begin consultations with a client by con-
ducting an employee survey that focuses on how the company treats its own
staff. This “cultural X-ray” provides an inside look at the organization’s inter-
nal focus that gives us an insight into how the current company culture is
affecting customer service. A company that treats its staff poorly can’t expect
the staff to treat customers like royalty.
Educating everyone, everywhere
Your front-line staff has the greatest amount of interaction with your cus-
tomers. Many times, however, these are the workers within the organization
who receive the least amount of education. In this context, education means
formal classroom-style training in which the objective is to build skills and

Know thyself! (and know thy customers!)
As part of a survey we conducted for one divi-
sion of a large multinational, we asked senior
executives, middle managers, and front-line
staff to choose from a list of 100 service quali-
ties the ones they thought were most important
to their customers. We then asked those same
customers to choose from the same list. The
three qualities the supplier thought were most
important were ranked by the customers as the
least important service qualities on the list. The
three items listed by the customers as the most
important were listed by the supplier as the
least important!

awareness in specific areas of service excellence and any general improve-
ment activities, including coaching sessions, team problem-solving meetings,
and so on that illuminate the importance of service in those staff members’
specific jobs.
The overarching activities of service education can take the form of newslet-
ters, briefings, meetings, videos, and so on. Maximum effectiveness is gained
when formal training and general education are combined — as in the follow-
ing case:
One company we know waited a full year into its customer service
improvement program before introducing service-skills training to its
staff. The reasoning: The company’s managers wanted to wait until they
were sure that the staff was well informed (general education) about the
company’s long-term sales and service strategies and some planned
changes in the organizational structure and systems. By preparing the
soil in such a way, the formal service training, once initiated (with ses-
sions focusing on such topics as dealing with difficult customers, going
the extra step, and so on) took root quickly. This approach produced
immediate positive feedback from customers who noticed a definite atti-
tude change.
Educating the front-line staff alone isn’t enough to create a customer-centric
company. Equally as important as educating your front-line staff is training
the managers of your company about how to create an environment that
favors service excellence. “Train those people (the front-line staff), and the
wheels of the corporate machine will keep running smoothly” is a manage-
ment mentality we often run into in our consulting work. Merely focusing on
the front lines rarely leads to improved service and almost always leads to
resentment.
For example, enthusiasm generated by participants in a training workshop is
fragile; it’s easily extinguished by the environment to which they must return.
The manager must take steps to reinforce what was learned in the workshop.
Otherwise, the training may be quickly forgotten, and the money spent for
naught.
Creating customer-centric systems
In our work, we see that in-focused systems, systems that work favorably for
the company but unfavorably for the customer, serve as the fulcrum on
which a successful move toward being customer centered rests. Companies
must be willing to examine and change these systems to become more cus-
tomer centric. Until the inherent service problems caused by such systems
are resolved, any service improvements are limited.
43
Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy

The prospect of creating customer-centric systems can be overwhelming. Part
of the problem lies in the tangled web of procedures, policies, and actual tech-
nology that make up the systems and act as a blueprint for the way a com-
pany does business. Although obviously indispensable, these systems can
help or hurt your customers and staff, depending on how they’re designed.
Some systems are set up with an objective of preventing employees and cus-
tomers from taking advantage of the company — a protective measure. For
example, the delivery procedure for a large consumer-products company
involved delivery personnel having to call the distribution center for autho-
rization to accept merchandise for return to the warehouse. The call to the
distribution center was then routed to the warehouse manager, who then
called the sales manager for approval, and so on, ad nauseam. This time-
consuming procedure delayed the driver enough to make him late for his
next delivery. This inefficiency was further compounded (and confounded)
by the fact that permission for the return of merchandise was granted in 
nine cases out of ten.
Customers suffered as a result of a system that made returns unnecessarily
difficult and prevented drivers from completing their routes on time — even
though the company derived some benefit by slightly reducing the amount of
returned merchandise.
Other systems still exist because they’re the way the company always has
done business. No one questions their validity or effectiveness. One woman
at a workshop that we led stated the problem perfectly when she said, “In our
company, adhering to the procedures and policies overrides common sense!”
Quality groups or service-improvement teams (see Chapter 9) work well
when developing procedures and processes. They empower the entire staff
to take ownership of the new procedures and processes and ensure that staff
members who are the closest to the customers and know the most about the
issues are an integral part of brainstorming service solutions. Remember that
changes in processes and technology need to be based on customer and
employee feedback. After you’ve gathered feedback, you can use quality
groups to design the new procedures and processes.

Using a broken ceiling to boost morale
In an earthquake in San Francisco a few years
ago, downtown businesses sustained a consid-
erable amount of damage to their offices. In one
case, most of the ceiling tiles in the customer-
service department crashed down onto staff
members’ desks. No one was hurt, but the place
was a mess. The manager wanted to lift his
staff’s morale, so he took one of the ceiling tiles,
spray-painted it gold, and with an inscription
dubbed it “The Mover And Shaker Award.”
Each month, he put the award on the desk of the
best performing customer-service representa-
tive. This manager proved that it isn’t so much
the award as it is the spirit in which it’s given.

Developing consistency
Friendliness, courtesy, responsiveness, and accuracy are worthy goals, but
how do you achieve them, given that they mean different things to different
people? If you ask ten people what being friendly to a customer means, you’ll
more than likely receive ten different answers. You have to quantify service
quality by developing specific, objective, and measurable service standards
that translate service quality into specific behaviors and actions. Service 
standards provide a basis for the objective evaluation of staff performance
and ensure consistency of treatment for customers across the board.
You must clearly communicate to your staff the behaviors that are required
to meet these standards. For example:
A manager for a large hotel chain with whom we were working received
multiple complaints from customers that his senior front-desk clerk was
difficult to deal with. In an attempt to remedy the situation, the manager
explained to the clerk the importance of being friendly. Much to the man-
ager’s dismay, none of his coaching produced the desired result. Finally,
the front-desk clerk asked the manager to detail specifically what he
should do to appear friendly. The manager realized that he had wrongly
assumed the clerk knew how to translate the service quality of friendli-
ness into specific behaviors. Obviously, the clerk didn’t know the specific
behaviors, so the manager explained that the clerk should smile, make
eye contact, use the customer’s name, and so on. Within a few weeks, the
manager received numerous compliments from customers on the front-
desk clerk’s friendly manner.

Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy
The six keys to customer service in the real world
One major airline has developed a system that
links all six customer-service strategies
together. Once every quarter, the airline surveys
several thousand passengers while they’re
waiting to retrieve their luggage in baggage
claim. The results of the survey are turned over
to task teams who look for trends and make 
service improvements based on the customer
feedback. Training courses are then updated to
reflect concerns highlighted in the surveys. The
next quarter the whole process starts over
again, thus creating a loop between all six
essential strategic areas.

Recognizing excellence 
every chance you get
In a company’s culture, what gets recognized and rewarded is what gets
done. Every recognition program needs to have three important elements:
 A formal recognition program: Formal recognition can be department-,
division-, or company-wide. It needs to provide rewards for the individ-
ual or team that best fulfills specified service criteria. The rewards can
include cash, movie tickets, vacations, and so on.
 An atmosphere of informal recognition: Casual, everyday acknowledg-
ment of staff that’s often expressed by the manager’s spontaneous ges-
tures is what we’re talking about here. It can be in the form of thank-you
notes, pizza parties, sharing customers’ complimentary letters, and so on.
 Salary and advancement: In the final analysis, all staff must see some
personal benefit in increasing their sensitivity toward customers. If pro-
viding quality customer service isn’t central to the possibility of
advancement in pay and position, then the gospel of service becomes
just so much hot air.
Implementing Your Strategy
In the immortal words of Will Rogers:
Even if you are on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.
Being aware of the key areas in building a winning service strategy is only half
of the picture. Your next step is creating an overall implementation plan that
takes your strategy from paper to reality. This plan has four phases, each of
which we discuss in detail in this section. We’ve used this strategy and have
seen similar ones used with great success in the United States and abroad with:
 Manufacturing and service businesses
 Public and private sector companies
 Fortune 500 and small businesses
Think of this four-phase plan as akin to putting together one of those really
big 3-D puzzles of New York’s Manhattan skyline. At first, you excitedly open
the box and dump the contents onto the dining room table. As you begin to
work on the puzzle, you’re amazed by how easily things fit into place. After a
while, though, you hit the hard spots and become frustrated because you just
can’t find the top of that darn Empire State Building. Eventually, you arrange
all the pieces perfectly, and the completed puzzle is proudly displayed on
your dining room table.

Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

Just like working a puzzle, creating an overall strategy for making your com-
pany more service-oriented takes patience, careful attention to detail, and
diligence to get positive results. However, when the strategy is complete, the
clarity you gain for where you’re going and how you’ll get there, not to men-
tion your sense of satisfaction, is well worth your efforts.
We recommend that you use the following sections as a general guideline to
creating an overall service strategy, modifying it where necessary to suit the
unique needs and circumstances of your organization.
Phase 1: Awareness building
If you’ve already invested some time in improving the quality of service your
company or department is providing, much of your effort still may be
focused on other priorities and goals, such as generating revenue, cutting
costs, and budgeting — with more attention going toward quantitative rather
than qualitative aspects of the company.
This first phase of implementing your service strategy is designed to help
you build awareness throughout your company (from the top to bottom) of
the overall importance of the role that service plays in your company’s
future. The main activities that we recommend in this phase are
 Conducting formal surveys of your customers to assess overall satis-
faction levels and determine the main customer-service issues.
Benchmarking your starting point before you begin any service improve-
ment program is essential. Various methods you can use to gather feed-
back include
• Telephone interviews
• Mail surveys
• Face-to-face interviews
• E-mail surveys
• Complaint-analysis tools
• Lost-account surveys
• Focus groups
If you haven’t done your customer research, stop dead in your tracks; go
no further. Don’t waste your time by moving on to other phases before
you actually know what your customers and staff think.
 Creating an executive task team to champion the service improvement
effort. This task team should be composed of managers and executives
with enough clout and authority to make and implement decisions that
affect the policies, procedures, and processes within your company.
Avoid the mistake of creating a task team of managers too junior to really
make anything fly.
47
Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy

 Determining the overall objectives and goals of the service improve-
ment effort, which include developing a timeline and establishing
accountabilities. Many companies have a vision of serving their cus-
tomers, but few have articulated a specific strategy to accomplish this
goal. By using feedback from surveys, the executive task team can
develop an overall strategy for service improvement that includes:
• Setting specific goals for customer satisfaction — for example,
achieving a 90 percent excellent rating on all product review forms.
• Deciding on specific actions to be taken in each of the key areas
involved in creating a customer-centric organization — for exam-
ple, putting all staff and managers through a training program that
improves their basic customer-service skills. (See the section titled
“Six Key Strategies for Customer Service” at the beginning of this
chapter.)
Phase 2: Education and training
At this stage, your company or department already has recognized the
importance of quality service, and the talk in meetings and memos is about
the need to take better care of customers. Your senior management team may
already have even taken one or two highly visible actions toward this end.
The focus in this phase is on putting a specific structure in place that edu-
cates all managers and employees (regardless of department) about how
they’ll participate in the company’s goal of becoming more customer centric.
We recommend that at a minimum you:
 Hold an all-company meeting or a series of smaller meetings to intro-
duce an initiative designed to make you and your company more 
customer-friendly.
 Implement an organization-wide service training program for staff
and managers in all areas of the business. Long-term service improve-
ments won’t happen without providing:
• Customer-service skills for front-line and backroom staff.
• Service management skills for all managers.
• Team-oriented problem-solving skills for all employees.
Phase 3: Process improvement
Companies or departments that are ready for Phase 3 are actively engaged in
the process of becoming customer centric and genuinely see providing excel-
lent service as a priority. Even though you still think you have a long way to
48
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

go, your commitment to service is manifested in everyday policies and
behaviors that are noticeable to staff and customers alike. At this point, the
goal is to dive into the work of evaluating and redesigning (where needed)
the major processes and procedures that affect your customers. We recom-
mend that you:
 Implement an employee-centered continuous improvement program
that includes such elements as quality groups, task teams, or brain-
storming sessions that focus on process improvement within the 
company.
Front-line staff members can provide you with invaluable input about
how to make your policies and procedures more customer centric, so be
sure to draw on their expert knowledge when reviewing major proce-
dures and design standards.
 Review major procedures and processes that impact the customer and
redesign the ones that need improvement.
Although every company has a multitude of systems, the key systems to
examine when striving to become a more customer-centric organization
include
• Sales/ordering systems
• Supply/logistics systems
• Accounting/payment systems
• After-sales service systems
• Complaint procedures
• Crisis/contingency systems
• Telephone/computer systems
• Web/e-mail interfaces
• Customer relationship management (CRM) systems
 Design and implement standards for service excellence throughout
the organization.
Standards are specific and measurable. For example:
• Answering the phone within three rings
• Responding to all e-mail inquires within 48 hours
• Returning all customer calls within 24 hours
• Filling all orders within one day of receipt
49
Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy

Phase 4: Organizational infrastructure
If you’ve reached this phase, your company or department already has
achieved a strong customer-centric business culture. In fact, service excel-
lence seems to have taken on a life of its own and has been translated into
specific standards and procedures that permeate the daily operations of your
company. Quality service has become, for all intents and purposes, a way of
life. Because of the groundwork you’ve already laid, any efforts you put into
further building your company infrastructure to improve service will be rela-
tively easy to implement and produce a high return within a reasonable
amount of time. Recommended actions in this phase include the following:
 Conducting performance evaluations using established service 
standards.
 Formally recognizing individual and team efforts toward making
improvements in service excellence.
 Redesigning the hiring process to screen applicants for customer-
friendly orientation.
Four Critical Questions
Although many companies go through the process of writing strategies for
customer service improvement, a surprising number don’t seriously consider
the resources (people, time, money, and effort) that are required to turn a
strategy into a reality. The four big questions that your company needs to
consider as part of finalizing your service improvement plan are highlighted
in the sections that follow.
50
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 
Taking a kaizen approach
Your mind probably has been racing as you read
this chapter. If you’re like many people, your
thoughts have ping-ponged between relief and
pride about what your company is doing right
and feelings of regret, concern, or guilt about
the areas where you and it fall short.
The Japanese word kaizen expresses what 
we think is a good, basic philosophy to keep in
mind as you go through this process. Loosely
translated, it means “small, continuous improve-
ments.” If you continue to focus on the little,
everyday ways you can improve service, you’ll
find that over time, your company will be able 
to face its competitors and its future with 
confidence.
The quest for excellent service in your business
has to be a way of life because it’s a continuing
process that never is over and done with.

Who needs to be on the 
implementation team?
Because the implementation of your strategy affects your entire company
(not just the more obvious customer contact departments such as sales, mar-
keting, and customer service), all areas including accounting, production,
and information services need to be represented on the implementation
team.
Making sure the top dogs are on board
Keep in mind that the members of this team are the people who will lead
your company through its transformation from in-focused to customer-
focused. As such, they need to have the authority to design an overall service
strategy and the power to implement it.
Occasionally, we’ve worked with companies in which executives have tried to
clone themselves by delegating their position on the service improvement
team to middle managers within the company. This scenario is especially
common in larger companies where executives consider themselves too busy
to sit in yet more meetings.
This procedure almost never works, because although the middle managers
often are well-intentioned, intelligent, capable people, they don’t have the
political weight or authority to actually implement the plan they’ve created.
Not only does this tactic undermine the implementation process, it also
undermines the managers’ morale. Managers come up with a great idea and
get excited about the possibility of change only to have their hopes dashed
when they discover that the executives who put them on the team are form-
ing the roadblocks to getting anything done. For this reason, the senior exec-
utives of your company need to be the ones who spearhead the process and
take their place as the players on the team.
If you’re the owner of the company or the president of your organization,
show your sincere commitment to quality service by making it a priority to
be on the team and show up at every meeting enthusiastic about the process.
This kind of top-driven commitment does more than anything else to inspire
the rest of your company to get on the service bandwagon.
If you’re the owner of a small business, your core team probably will be com-
posed of you and your top two or three people. If you’re a manager with a
larger company, the team will need to include top key players within your
organization. We’ve found that having too many people on the team makes it
cumbersome to schedule meetings. To make the group as efficient and pro-
ductive as possible, no more than eight people are needed on the team.
51
Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy

Ensuring consistent attendance and participation
After you’ve assembled your team, consistency becomes the single most
important factor in your team’s success. To be consistent, the team needs to
meet from two to four hours every four to six weeks.
Moreover, each member must make attending the meetings a priority. At the
beginning of the process, most team members are excited. However, as time
goes by, the functions of the members’ jobs can start to dampen their enthu-
siasm as short-term, everyday concerns tug at them for attention. If you
aren’t careful, the meetings can become just one more item on a never-ending
to do list, and the bigger purpose of what you’re trying to accomplish will be
lost.
Bear in mind that a key player missing from a meeting can create havoc down
the road, because any major decisions that are made can affect the entire
company. Think of the process as similar to climbing a mountain. You and
your teammates are standing at base camp looking up at the peak you want
to reach. You’re all attached to one another with ropes and harnesses and off
you go, up the mountain. If you’re halfway up the mountain and a team
member says, “Sorry, but I changed my mind, I don’t want to be here any-
more,” you have a big problem.
You can help ensure consistent attendance by setting the dates for the next
six meetings at the initial gathering. Doing so enables all team members to
schedule the meetings well in advance so they can make plans to attend.
You may want to consider using an outside facilitator for these meetings. A
good facilitator keeps the meetings on track, provides coaching on how to
implement the action items, and acts as the nonpolitical mediator when dis-
agreements arise.
How long will this take and 
how much will this cost?
Once you’ve formulated the plan, your task shifts to implementing it.
Implementation takes both time and money. How much, you ask? Read on
and find out.
Time
The amount of time it takes to improve customer service within your com-
pany depends on the size of your company and how much work you’ve
already done to develop service awareness. Here are some estimates of how
long it will take in specific situations:
52
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

 A small business (fewer than 250 employees) can expect to implement
an entire service program (all six areas) within one year and see positive
results within the first three months.
 A mid-size company (250 to 1,500 employees) needs closer to two years
to implement the entire program but should see noticeable results
within the first six months.
 A large organization (over 1,500 employees) requires a minimum of three
years to implement the process, and it will take about one year before
any significant results are achieved.
Because becoming more customer-focused is a long-term process rather than
a quick fix, we strongly recommend that you let your entire company know
that huge results won’t be seen right away. By giving your staff members a
realistic timeline of what will happen when, you give them reasonable expec-
tations and curb their natural desire to see quick results. In general, you see
faster and better results when you focus on the critical few things to get done
rather than the trivial many.
Money
We have no magic formula for figuring out exactly what implementing your
company’s service improvement program will cost. We’ve met owners of
small businesses who’ve created entire service improvement programs for
$10,000. Then again, we’ve run across many Fortune 500 companies that have
spent millions.
In general, though, a total service-improvement strategy from soup to nuts
will cost you approximately $1,000 to $1,500 per employee, sometimes more,
sometimes less. Part of your team’s challenge is to come up with a budget
that is workable for your company and sufficient for getting the job done.
There is no free lunch! If your main concern is how to manage this type of
strategy on the quick and cheap, then you may want to reconsider how com-
mitted you really are to the process. Although you can do many things to
keep your costs down and under control, this process requires an upfront
commitment of time and financial resources. (If you own a small business and
find yourself in a cold sweat right about now, relax. In the following chapters,
we suggest plenty of lower-cost solutions that you can use to stay within
your means and still produce the desired results.)
It costs five times more marketing and sales dollars to gain a new customer
than it does to retain a current one. Most companies we talk to think the
money they spend in the short term to improve service has actually resulted
in long-term savings. If you look closely, you, too, will probably find that the
cost of repeated efforts, wasted time, loss of customer goodwill, and actual
loss of customers, is far greater than the amount of money you may spend
creating a more customer-focused company.
53
Chapter 3: Building a Winning Service Strategy

Who’s going to get all this stuff done?
By this point, your team may be having nightmares about working 20-plus
hours a day to get their regular jobs done, and at the same time, taking on all
the actions your team is planning. Well, we have good news for you: You
don’t have to move a cot into your office — not just yet anyway.
Each member of your team is assigned the ultimate responsibility for ensur-
ing that a specific action item is completed. This assignment doesn’t mean
that person is the one who has to carry out the task. On the contrary, he or
she is free to delegate selected activities to members of the staff.
What’s the best way to communicate 
the strategy?
One of the biggest pitfalls we’ve encountered in this process is senior man-
agement forgetting to communicate the strategy to the rest of the company.
By informing your staff about the strategy, you open their eyes to the big pic-
ture. Following are some suggested methods for communicating your strategy.
Hold an all-company meeting
A fast-and-easy way to get the message out to your employees is to conduct
an all-company meeting at which the president and/or senior managers intro-
duce the service strategy. This technique is a great way to get everyone fired
up and informed at the same time, and is the preferred method for many
small businesses that we know, because getting everyone together in one
place at the same time usually is relatively easy.
This method works great if you already have a company picnic, meeting, or
conference scheduled, because you have an excellent opportunity to make
the event even more special by announcing the service strategy.
Put a meeting tree in place
If you have a fairly large group of employees, you can get the word out
quickly by creating the company equivalent of a telephone tree — a meeting
tree. Your task team begins by meeting with their direct reports, who then
meet with their direct reports, who then meet with their direct reports, and
so on. Usually within a few days you can cover the entire company.
Be sure to outline the specific content that you want your managers to
deliver. Doing so prevents them from interpreting the message to the point
where their creativity gets too far away from the original point.
54
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

Limit meeting tree groups to between five and ten people, have a set agenda
that includes time for questions and answers, and keep the meetings to less
than 30 minutes in length.
Create a corporate video presentation
A corporate video featuring the president of your company (you, perhaps)
talking about his or her (your) commitment to customer service can be a
very powerful tool for spreading the service message. A few important items
to keep in mind if you decide to go this route are
 Hiring a professional to shoot and edit the videotape. Nobody likes
being subjected to a cheesy, poorly put together video, especially when
the tape is talking about the importance of service and quality.
 Making sure that the president of the company has practiced his or
her presentation and, if necessary, has received coaching on how to
appear lively, sincere, enthusiastic, and interesting on camera. If your
president looks like Dr. Death on camera, nobody will care about what
he or she is saying.
 Keeping it short and sweet. Don’t try to cover all your company issues
in one video. Instead, choose one or two clear messages and stick to
them.
Use your company newsletter
If your company already has a widely distributed newsletter in place, you
may want to use it to detail the specifics of the service strategy. We recom-
mend that you do so after you’ve made a general announcement using one of
the previously described methods. Your company newsletter is a good tool
for keeping your company updated on an ongoing basis and recording the
progress your team is making on implementing the strategy.

and Interviews

H
aving a customer-focused company means you must understand what
your customers want and expect from your business and then evaluate
how well you’re meeting those desires and expectations. An often overlooked
yet vital tool for accomplishing those tasks is the survey. Surveying helps you
 Gather specific feedback about how satisfied your customers are with
the level of service they receive
 Provide an initial benchmark against which you can measure future
progress
 Make changes, based on your research, to the way you do business
In this chapter, we clue you in on whom you need to survey, the type of
survey to conduct, who needs to conduct it, the best survey method to use,
and what you should do with the results.
To get the most accurate picture of your customers’ service experiences as a
whole, use a combination of the methods that we explain in this chapter. For
example, you can combine focus groups and written questionnaires, or tele-
phone interviews and Web-based surveys. Either combination gives you a
mix of general and specific feedback and qualitative and quantitative data.

Surveying Staff and Customers
If you’ve already decided to survey your customers and you’re reading this
chapter to find out the next step, don’t stop there. The importance of survey-
ing customers is obvious to most companies; however, we believe that a staff
survey also is an essential part of the surveying process.
We recommend that you survey your customers and staff simultaneously (or
at least not too far apart), because often the issues that come to light in your
customer responses directly correlate to situations described by your staff.
For example, in a survey we conducted for a software company, the majority
of customers reported dissatisfaction with the way they were treated when
they called the technical support department. In the corresponding staff
survey, several technical support representatives complained that their call
times were so closely monitored that they felt pressured to give incomplete
answers to one customer so they could move on to the next caller. By observ-
ing both sides of the problem, the company was able to make some immedi-
ate changes for the better.
Figuring Out What Type of 
Survey You Need to Do
The type of survey that your company chooses depends on your purpose for
doing the survey. Are you looking for some insight into why you’ve lost
market share? Are you interested in getting a general idea of how your cus-
tomers feel about your company? Maybe you’ve been experiencing high staff
turnover and want to get to the bottom of the problem. Here we discuss
some basic types of surveys that you may want to consider and why they
may or may not be right for you.
Random customer survey
The random customer survey is a tried-and-true, good old-fashioned, all-
around survey that’s used by companies that want to measure overall cus-
tomer satisfaction and highlight any widespread service problems. Random
surveys involve selecting a percentage of your customers; contacting them
by phone, e-mail, mail, or in person (or a combination of these approaches);
and asking them to evaluate the service they receive from your company. If
your company has never conducted a survey, or hasn’t done one in a long
time, a random survey is a good place to start.
58
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

In the written customer surveys we’ve conducted, the response rate usually
is between 40 percent and 60 percent. Remember to take these numbers into
account when deciding how many customers you need to survey to get back
the number of responses you want.
Company-wide attitude survey
The company-wide attitude survey helps you assess three areas that are criti-
cal to forging strong links in the chain that determines the service your cus-
tomers receive.
The company-wide attitude survey almost always is implemented through a
confidential questionnaire that is sent out to all staff members and managers.
If your company has never conducted a staff survey, or has morale problems
such as high turnover, we strongly recommend that you do a company atti-
tude survey.
How satisfied are your staff members with their jobs?
Nothing can tarnish the service your customers receive faster than coming
face to face with an employee who has a resentful attitude about his job or
your company.
This attitude can be caused by many things, but we find the most common are:
 Not feeling listened to or appreciated
 Feeling overwhelmed by an ever-increasing workload
 Inadequate job training or support
 Lack of teamwork between departments
 Poor supervisors or managers
Although none of these situations can be corrected overnight, a survey 
can help highlight common problem areas and put them on the table for 
discussion.
Do you have open channels of communication?
We’ve yet to deal with a company that didn’t have communication problems.
The question is: How serious are those problems? If, for example, your staff
members feel disenfranchised because they have no formal avenues for
giving feedback to upper management, then their frustration will be taken out
on customers. A staff survey can help you assess how well you’re establish-
ing open channels of communication and where room for improvement
exists.
59
Chapter 4: Better Service through Surveys

Do employees feel a sense of teamwork throughout your company?
Is each person within your company an island unto himself or herself? If the
coffee pot runs dry, does the last person using it brew another pot? If a cus-
tomer calls in and reaches the wrong person, is she treated with care and
concern or is she transferred randomly into telephone hyperspace? A staff
survey can help a great deal with identifying and correcting teamwork defi-
ciencies throughout your company.
Lost account survey
This type of survey is excellent whenever your company wants to know why
it has lost a particular customer or group of customers. Using this survey,
interviews are conducted (usually by telephone or in person — rarely e-mail)
with customers who no longer do business with your company.
One of the greatest benefits of the lost account survey is that you’re often
able to discover specific reasons why customers left. You can also let the lost
customer know that you’re sorry that he’s no longer doing business with you
and that you’re interested in learning from your mistakes. Understanding 
the customer’s reasons for leaving helps you make improvements for future
customers.
Because you’re catching the customer at a critical moment, you may have an
opportunity during the interview to save the account by using bounce-back
initiative, which means responding to a service problem by doing something
extra as a way of apologizing to the customer (see Chapter 16).
Depending on your industry, isolating the customer’s actual moment of
departure isn’t always easy, and without that information, recovering a cus-
tomer before it’s too late can be difficult, because you may miss your window
of opportunity to take timely and effective actions. If you’re able to catch the
customer in time, we recommend that you prevent the person who originally
was responsible from contacting the customer. To maintain objectivity, you
can instead have someone who has no previous contact with the customer
conduct the interview.
Target account survey
Rather than doing a random survey of your customer base, you may want to
do a more targeted and focused survey of a particular group of customers.
For example, if 80 to 90 percent of your business comes from ten customers,
you may want to create a survey that is specifically targeted toward them.
The advantage of a targeted survey is that it is limited in scope, precisely
focused, and can be specifically designed for a particular group.
60
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

We recommend this type of survey especially when you want to improve ser-
vice for a particular segment of your customer base.
Customer exit survey
On-the-spot interviews conducted with customers as they exit from your
place of business are great for assessing their immediate opinion of the ser-
vice they’ve just received. For example, at one time or another, you’ve proba-
bly been stopped by someone with a clipboard in hand as you left the
supermarket. That person probably asked whether you had a moment to
answer a few questions about the service you received at the store that day.
These customer exit surveys are a cousin of random customer surveys (see
section by the same name earlier in the chapter), with one important excep-
tion: They catch the customer immediately after he or she receives the ser-
vice. Doing so provides you with specific, accurate, and immediate feedback
while the experience is still fresh in the customer’s mind.
We recommend this type of survey whenever your customers physically visit
your place of business to use services or purchase products.
Determining Who Needs 
to Conduct Your Survey
Should you use an outside resource or conduct the survey using in-house
talent? That is the question! And the answer is not unlike deciding whether
you should fix your own car.
The main advantages of doing it yourself are that you can save money and
learn from the experience. The main disadvantage is that because you’re
probably not an expert, you may encounter unexpected problems that can
cost you additional time and money to fix.
Many companies choose to use an outside resource — a consulting company
or market research firm — to conduct their surveys, because they have the
expertise on hand to deliver top-notch survey results in the most efficient way.
In either case, conducting a survey requires varying amounts of resources
(mostly time and money) depending on the scope of your project. You need
to consider three things when deciding whether you conduct the survey
using in-house talent or whether you employ the services of an outside
agency that specializes in service surveys. We discuss those things in this
section.
61
Chapter 4: Better Service through Surveys

Assessing the size and makeup 
of your customer base
If your customer base runs into the thousands and you have various groups
(based on buying patterns, geographic location, or type of industry) requir-
ing separate review and analysis, then you probably need to consider using
an outside company to conduct your survey.
For example, suppose your customer base is made up of 3,000 accounts that
break down into two distinct groups. Accounts in one group buy your ser-
vices or products in small quantities, yet they buy frequently, and accounts
in a second group buy infrequently but purchase large amounts. In this case,
you may want to ask each group different questions and then compare the
responses. One of our clients discovered that their infrequent customers who
purchased large amounts generally preferred a personal call from a company
representative once a year rather than receiving monthly newsletters or
more frequent follow-ups. On the other hand, their frequent, small pur-
chasers generally wanted monthly updates via e-mail. By adjusting how they
contacted each group of customers, they saved money and kept both types
of customer happier.
The openness and honesty of your staff
When conducting your staff survey, you should consider how easy — or 
difficult — getting honest feedback will be. We find that most employees are
reluctant to write down what they really think when they know the results are
going to be scrutinized in-house. Even if you insist that they fill out the
survey anonymously, they may still worry that their answers will somehow
be recognized and used against them! Issues about confidentiality (and para-
noia) can undermine in-house staff surveys even when they’re conducted
with the best of intentions.
We once conducted a survey for a company that long ago had forgotten to
treat members of its staff like customers. Not surprisingly, low staff morale
was taking its toll on the service customers were receiving. After we mailed
staff questionnaires, we received several personal phone calls from various
staff members wanting to know whether the survey was truly confidential
and whether we really could be trusted not to leak their identities to their
bosses. Because we were an outside consulting company and had no axe to
grind, we were able to reassure staff and get some insightful feedback. This
feedback, we are sure, would not have been forthcoming had the company
collected the information itself.
62
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

Figuring Out Which Survey 
Method to Use
Survey methods are simply different ways that you can use to collect feed-
back from your customers and staff. In this section, we talk about the seven
main survey methods and why each may or may not be the best method for
you to use.
Web-based surveys
A Web-based survey is an easy, effective, and relatively inexpensive way to
measure your customers’ online service experience. You can hire profes-
sional companies to design your survey and evaluate the results, or if you
have the time and resources, you can design and evaluate a survey in-house.
The three basic types of Web-based surveys are
 E-mail invitation: Start by sending out an e-mail invitation to a desig-
nated group of customers, asking them to participate in a survey. Embed
a link for customers to click if they decide they want to complete the
survey. Upon clicking this link, they’re electronically whisked away to
your survey.
 Pop-up window: A pop-up window survey counts the number of visitors
who come to your site. At a predetermined number of visits to a com-
pany’s Web site (for example, every 200 visitors), a pop-up window
opens asking that user whether she’s willing to fill out a short online
survey. If the visitor chooses not to complete the survey, she can click
“No.” The pop-up window disappears, and she can go on her merry way.
Clicking “Yes” takes her to the online survey.
Many people are so tired of pop-up windows that they close them with-
out thinking. If you choose this survey type, be sure to make it clear that
the survey is legitimate and part of your Web site rather than an unau-
thorized intruder piggybacking your page.
 Feedback or survey buttons: Similar to the “tell us what you think”
survey cards found in most hotel rooms, feedback buttons tend to draw
feedback from extreme customers — either extremely satisfied or
extremely upset ones. For that reason, we recommend that you try to
avoid using feedback or survey buttons. Feedback buttons likewise
don’t provide representative samplings of your customer population,
and response rates for feedback buttons tend to be low (less than 1 per-
cent), so your survey results aren’t statistically valid.

Written questionnaires
The Internet has made surveying much easier and more cost-effective than it
used to be. Today you can e-mail a questionnaire to your employees and cus-
tomers on the other side of the world — instantly! Whether they respond as
quickly is another matter.
Regardless of whether you go paper or digital, always limit your surveys to
one or two pages, because any more can tax the short attention span that
most of us have for answering questions. Give good thought to the questions,
making sure they address the specific concerns of the customer or staff
group that you’re surveying. The questions you ask in the survey usually
need to be phrased in one of following three ways.
Yes-or-no questions
Yes-or-no questions are closed-ended questions, meaning that they’re phrased
in such a way that they prompt simple yes or no answers. These questions
commonly are used to gather general information. The respondent (the
person answering) simply circles or clicks the appropriate responses. For
example:
Do you have a living will?
Yes
No
Is your current life insurance sufficient?
Yes
No
Do you own your own home?
Yes
No
Poor-to-excellent questions
Poor-to-excellent questions usually begin with the words “how” or “what”
and ask respondents to rank their responses on a scale from poor to excel-
lent. Respondents simply answer the questions by clicking the word or
number that best reflects their opinions. For example:
How would you rate the overall service you received from our technical sup-
port staff? (Circle one.)
Poor
Fair
Good
Excellent
What is your overall evaluation of our technical support group? (Circle one.)
(Poor) 1
2
3
4
5
6 (Excellent)
Degree questions
Degree questions usually start with the words “did,” “does,” “do,” or “to what
degree.” They usually refer to specific experiences or events and ask respon-
dents to rate their responses by choosing one of four specific descriptive
phrases. For example:
64
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

To what degree did our Web site answer your questions about our company?
(Select one.)
___ To a large degree
___ To a moderate degree
___ To a small degree
___ Not at all
Similarly, you can present statements that offer a scale of possible answers
that range from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” Respondents simply
receive an instruction, such as: “Choose the phrase that best reflects your
opinions.” For example:
Our accounting department provides you with accurate and timely billing.
(Select one.)
___ Strongly agree
___ Agree
___ Disagree
___ Strongly disagree
The salesperson I deal with is very knowledgeable about the product. 
(Select one.)
(Strongly agree) 1
2
3
4
5
6 (Strongly disagree)
If you’re using a numbering format and want to avoid middle-of-the-road
answers, use a series of numbers that ends with an even number, such as 1 
to 6, rather than a series of numbers that ends with an odd number, such 
as 1 to 5. By using an even amount of numbers, you remove the middle-
number option, and thus the respondent must get off the fence and express a
preference in one direction or the other.
Sample questionnaires and memos
Here are samples of a customer questionnaire and a staff questionnaire that
you can use as guidelines for developing your own surveys. In addition to the
sample questionnaires, we include some sample e-mail memos to customers
and staff members inviting them to participate in the surveying process.
These memos give you an idea of the flavor and content you may want to
include in your own e-mails to your customers and staff. Make sure that you
let your customers and staff members know how much you appreciate their
participation in the survey.

Telephone surveys
Sometimes geographic distance, time constraints, or other factors make a
telephone survey the ideal way to go. Telephone surveys come in two basic
styles: ask-and-answer and discussion.
Ask-and-answer surveys
Ask-and-answer surveys follow a predesigned set of questions that are meant
neither for improvisation nor embellishment. The interviewer, after explain-
ing the type of rating scale she is using, reads each question to the respon-
dent and makes a note of the answers. Because ask-and-answer telephone
surveys are basically written questionnaires that are spoken, they don’t nec-
essarily require an interviewer who has any familiarity with the industry that
is being surveyed. For example, an interviewer who has no knowledge of cars
can ask the following question as easily as a seasoned mechanic could:
“Using a scale of one to six, where one means poor and six means excellent,
please rate the following question: How would you rate the courtesy of the
service technician who checked in your car?”
69
Chapter 4: Better Service through Surveys

Discussion
Discussion telephone surveys ask more spontaneous and exploratory ques-
tions and can be effectively conducted only by an interviewer who has a
good understanding of the nature of the business being surveyed. A good
interviewer in this situation picks up on part of an answer and then probes
the respondent for more details. The discussion format enables you to con-
duct surveys in greater depth that often lead to the discovery of issues that
weren’t identified prior to speaking with the customer. For example:
Interviewer:
What was your impression of the service technician who
checked in your car?
Customer:
He was okay.
Interviewer:
Was there something that he could have done better?
Customer:
He seemed to be in a bad mood.
Interviewer:
Was it something he said?
Customer:
Not exactly, it was more the way he said, “Good morning.”
He sounded kind of gruff, as if he’d just had a fight with his
boss.
Focus groups
Focus groups are groups of eight to ten of your customers who come together,
at your invitation, to answer service-related questions that are prepared by
you and then presented by your moderator. Because of the group dynamic,
focus groups usually provide plenty of rich feedback in a relatively short
period of time. The average focus group usually lasts for an hour to an hour
and a half.
Customers are invited by letter (usually followed with a confirmation phone
call) to participate in a focus group. Breakfast or lunch often is served as a
courtesy whenever meetings take place during the workday. Some companies
invite their customers to participate during the evening and serve light
refreshments.
The success of any focus group depends largely on the moderator’s skill. The
moderator can be an external consultant or someone from inside your com-
pany. Armed with a few predesigned questions, the moderator’s main role is
 Ensuring that everyone around the table has an opportunity to speak.
 Keeping the group on track.
 Probing for the most in-depth information possible.
 Taking detailed notes that will be transcribed later.
70
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

Initial questions asked by the moderator usually are simple conversation
starters such as:
 How is the overall level of service of this company?
 What is one thing you’d like to see this company improve or change?
 How is the company’s response when you have problems?
Invite 50 percent more customers than you want to attend. Doing so allows
for about a one-third no-show rate, which is fairly normal. You can choose
from several different venues in which to conduct your focus groups. The
three main locations or facilities are market research companies that often
have specially equipped rooms you can rent, hotel meeting rooms, or a pri-
vate and quiet onsite meeting room.
Face-to-face interviews
When you want to get the most anecdotal information from your customers
in the most personal format, use the face-to-face interview method. These are
one-on-one meetings that are useful when dealing with issues such as:
 Finding out why a customer has stopped doing business with you.
 Getting feedback from customers who deal with competing companies.
 Approaching senior executives for whom a group setting would be 
inappropriate.
We recommend that you don’t use tape recorders or video cameras when
you’re in face-to-face meetings. This equipment is far too obtrusive. The only
acceptable method of recording your customer’s feedback in this type of set-
ting is by taking notes.
Customer panels
Of all the survey methods we use with our clients, we find that customer
panels make the greatest impact on our clients. Something about hearing the
information straight from the horse’s mouth (if you’ll excuse the expression)
is both powerful and undeniable. One disadvantage to customer panels is the
amount of time they take. Nonetheless, we think the results they produce
make the effort well worth it. The sections that follow are suggestions for
making the most of a customer panel.
71
Chapter 4: Better Service through Surveys

Before the panel
Personally call a small number of your customers (usually no more than
three to six people) and invite them to participate on a customer panel.
Carefully consider the customers you choose to be on the panel by selecting
people who are willing and able to give you balanced feedback. Establish a
date, location, and time for your panel to meet (plan for 60 to 90 minutes)
and reiterate that you’re looking for balanced feedback on both the positive
and negative aspects of the service your company provides. In addition,
explain to your customers that approximately 10 to 25 of your company’s
managers and staff members will attend to hear what the panel has to say.
During the panel
Set up the room in a U-shape with a table upfront where members of the
panel will sit. Make sure that each participant has a nametag, pen, paper, and
water. The moderator asks a single question and gives each participant five
minutes or so to answer, then moves on to the next question. Some general
questions may include
 What, in your perception, is Company X’s biggest strength? Biggest
weakness?
 How well does Company X keep you informed?
 How easy is it to do business with Company X?
 Compared to expectations that you have, how do Company X’s products
and services perform?
 How well does Company X meet its commitments? Does it deliver what it
promises?
 What would Company X need to do to exceed your expectations?
Enable the audience to address a limited number of questions to your pan-
elists, so that the audience can be perfectly clear on what the panelists are
saying. It’s critical that the audience doesn’t:
 Argue with the panelists’ comments
 Try to explain something the panelist has misunderstood
 Try to fix the problem then and there
 Become defensive in any way
The idea is to listen and learn what your customers have to say. Address any
issues that arise during the panel’s discussion after the panel is adjourned.
72
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization 

After the panel
Personally call and thank each panelist for participating. If issues arose
during the panel relating to that particular panelist, set up a follow-up meet-
ing to discuss the specifics of the problem or to outline the steps you’re
taking to resolve the problem. Although not necessary, some companies send
a thank-you gift to panel participants.
Mystery shoppers
Mystery shopping uses detective work to measure your company’s service
performance. The first thing to do is contract with a professional market
research firm that offers mystery shopping. The company then sends
employees to your store to pose as your customers. After observing your
company’s service in action, your contractor puts together a report that
offers feedback on your service performance, using a combination of quanti-
tative scoring and anecdotal information.
You can also apply the mystery-shopping method to evaluate your online 
service.
Communicating the Results
The benefits of gathering feedback can be negated if you don’t follow through
with the results. After your company takes the initiative to actively invite
feedback, you must take actions to correct at least some, if not all, of the
problem areas highlighted. Doing so is vital.
Going to the effort of gathering the information and then not doing anything
about the problems that are identified not only is a waste of time and money,
but it can also increase the likelihood that future service improvement efforts
will be viewed with skepticism.
That’s why you must close the loop on the surveys you’ve conducted by get-
ting back to the people — usually via e-mail — who provided you with the
feedback. Doing so benefits your relationship with your staff and customers,
because you not only confirm that you heard what they said but also that
you’re making changes accordingly.
73
Chapter 4: Better Service through Surveys

After conducting an extensive company attitude survey, one of our clients
condensed the report findings, which were some 50 pages long, into a four-
page synopsis that was sent out to every staff member. This action was taken
several weeks before the beginning of a large customer-service training pro-
gram was launched. As a result, participants entering the workshops were
more aware of current service issues and the reasons for the training pro-
gram. Forwarding the survey results also helped confirm that employee feed-
back was being heard and taken seriously by senior management.

A
sk executives from any company that has achieved consistent improve-
ments in customer service and they’ll tell you that they could not have
done it without a comprehensive and well-executed training program. At the
same time a training program enhances the service your customers receive,
it also benefits your company by increasing teamwork between departments,
improving the customer-service skills of staff, and helping managers under-
stand their roles in making service shine.
After you’ve created an overall service strategy and surveyed your cus-
tomers and staff, training is a natural next step because it reinforces your
commitment to service excellence. By bringing training into the picture early,
you can comfortably ease your staff into the ideas, concepts, and language of
customer focus. In creating your training program, you need to consider
these questions:
 Who needs to receive training?
 What types of training are needed?
 What training methods will work best?
 How can you prepare your staff for the training program?
 How will you follow up after the training?

Service Is Everyone’s Business 
from CEO to Secretary
A big mistake that we’ve seen many companies make is training only a small
percentage of their staffs — usually the people who work directly with cus-
tomers, such as the customer-service, technical-support, and help-desk
departments. Limiting training in that manner is ineffective and dangerous,
because it promotes the message that customer service is the specific
responsibility of only a limited number of people within the organization
rather than everyone’s responsibility.
To achieve a true customer focus, service needs to be a way of life for every-
one in your company. As soon as you try to confine it to a single department,
it’s dead. By providing training at all levels — from your part-time help to the
president — you promote the important message that service is everyone’s
business.
Seven Core Types of Training
A comprehensive training program includes different types of workshops on
a variety of subjects. The type of training you decide to provide depends on
the feedback you receive from your staff and customers.
76
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization
Too much technology
We find that many companies have a higher
comfort level with hard technical training than
they do with soft interpersonal training.
Although technical training is important, plan-
ning for customer-service training must be part
of your overall strategy if you want to achieve
excellent customer service.
A client of ours spent a few million dollars
upgrading its technology. The company
installed new systems that enabled its 
customer-service reps to locate a customer’s
goods — anywhere in the world — within
nanoseconds. Technologically, the company
was the leader in its industry, and its customers
were impressed with the speedy response
times. In spite of this success, and much to the
bewilderment of the company, it was receiving
an excessive number of complaints from cus-
tomers using its new super-duper system.
After conducting several customer focus
groups, we found that the cause of the problem
had little to do with the new technology and
everything to do with the way the customers
were being treated. Apparently, the customer-
service reps had been through technical train-
ing on how to work with the new system, but
they’d received no interpersonal training on
good customer-service skills.

In this section, we discuss seven core types of training and how they impact
the quality of service your company delivers.
Awareness building
Training to build awareness serves as a basic introduction to customer serv-
ice and needs to involve everyone in your company from the top down. This
training program is often the first one to be conducted, because it deals 
with the general principles of customer service (rather than specific skills),
emphasizes the concepts of the internal and external customer, and helps
build teamwork between departments.
Core customer-service skills
Training focused on improving core customer-service skills is aimed specifi-
cally at staff members whose jobs involve frequent contact with customers,
whether it’s over the telephone or face to face. This training needs to be
more in-depth than the awareness-building program and intent on helping
front-line staff identify and strengthen the interpersonal and problem-solving
skills they need to be able to provide their customers with excellent service.
Members of your staff are less likely to open up and talk frankly about impor-
tant issues when they’re sitting in this training session with their managers.
We recommend that you think about group dynamics when planning a train-
ing session and exercise care so as not to unwittingly create an uncomfort-
able situation that can stifle participation.
When providing core customer-service skills training, don’t forget to include
the members of your staff who perform internal customer-service functions
with their co-workers in other departments (human resources, information
technology, and so on). Training for internal service staff needs to address
these three main issues:
 Helping staff members understand how the backroom tasks they per-
form have an indirect yet critical bearing on the quality of service the
paying customer receives
 Identifying who the key internal customers are and clarifying their
expectations
 Teaching employees the problem-solving and interpersonal skills they
need to effectively fulfill the expectations of their internal customers
77
Chapter 5: Company-Wide Training as a Catalyst for Change

E-mail training
Although e-mail is a staple of the customer-service environment, its remote
nature, which eliminates tone of voice and body language (see Chapter 20),
presents a huge potential for misunderstanding and misinterpretation with
customers. This type of training needs to be provided to anyone in the com-
pany who uses e-mail. Topics to be covered in the course can include the 
following:
 E-mail etiquette
 Inbox management
 The ethics and legality of e-mail
 Building online rapport
Team building
Team-building training reinforces the message that customer service is a
team sport. Specifically, team-building training helps the members of your
staff see how they can improve the way they work with each other to provide
better service.
For example: Your customer survey showed a consistent problem with on-
time delivery. The root of the problem, you discover, is that the different
departments involved in the process don’t communicate or relate to one
another very well. For whatever reason, each department operates in a
vacuum and is unaware of (and to tell the truth uninterested in) what other
departments are doing. You can use team-building training to dramatically
improve the situation by focusing on how each person’s job and each depart-
ment is part of a chain of events that eventually leads to the customer’s satis-
faction, and of course, on how the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Critical to the success of team-building training is that open and honest 
feedback between the different departments must be encouraged during 
the training program. You can take three different approaches toward team-
building training:
 Integrating: This approach involves integrating the general principles of
team building with any existing customer-service training.
 Solving a problem: Use the training session as a forum for brainstorm-
ing and discussing a specific problem. Participants who have a stake in
solving a particular problem naturally go through the process of becom-
ing a stronger team.
78
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization

 Simulating team situations: This approach is probably the most effec-
tive way to begin team-building training, because it highlights and iso-
lates specific behaviors that foster or hinder teamwork.
This kind of training uses a simulated situation in which the training
group is divided into teams of four or five and then given a prepared sce-
nario (available from training companies) that describes the specific cir-
cumstances of their predicament. Each team is provided with a number
of different tasks to perform, and then the training group as a whole
must come to a consensus on how to complete them. Although the situa-
tion is not real, most participants become so engrossed in the problem
that they behave exactly the way they would if they were at work deal-
ing with a real problem. After the exercise, the teams analyze the quality
of their answers and how well they listened to and communicated with
other people on their team.
Problem-solving
Problem-solving training provides a foundation for continuous process
improvement and needs to involve everyone in the company from senior
management to front-line staff. The purpose of problem-solving training is to
help participants understand various models of problem-solving, discover
specific techniques for analyzing problems, and use a variety of tools for
solving problems on the job. For more information about a specific problem-
solving process that we recommend, see Chapter 9.
Consider mixing and matching a variety of employees from different depart-
ments when forming the groups that will attend the same training classes.
Employees from different departments and geographic locations then have
an opportunity to get to know each other during exercises and breaks. A
training class is a wonderful way for people who talk to one another over the
phone and with e-mail every day to meet each other for the first time.
Service management
Training all front-line staff in core customer-service skills and attitudes is an
essential part of sustaining long-term improvements in customer satisfaction.
Managers must likewise demonstrate a commitment to being customer-centric
through their own management styles and actions. Service-management train-
ing provides managers and team leaders with an opportunity to evaluate
their current level of customer focus, find a specific process for becoming
more customer-focused, and plan key strategies and actions that will
enhance the overall service focus of their work groups.
79
Chapter 5: Company-Wide Training as a Catalyst for Change

All the managers in your company (including the president and top execu-
tives) need to attend some type of service management training that focuses
on these three areas:
 Improving your managers’ awareness of and ability to be a role model
for service
 Enhancing your managers’ skills and understanding of how to empower
and coach members of the staff to provide the best possible service
 Rewarding staff for customer-service excellence
We recommend that you use an outside consultant or trainer to lead your
service-management training sessions. An outside specialist usually is per-
ceived as a more credible source of information, because the specialist has
no political ties to your company. Because of this lack of political ties, the
specialist is free to challenge the ideas and assumptions of the group without
fear of repercussion.
Although other types of training, such as time management, sales, negotiating
skills, and so on, aren’t basic to customer service, you need to consider them
a valuable part of enhancing overall excellence within your company and
plan to incorporate them into your training curriculum.
Executive education
Ultimately the success of any customer-service improvement effort within
your company rests on the support it receives from the executives and
senior managers.
This type of training helps your company’s senior managers deepen their
insights into the customer focus of the organization, and most importantly,
helps foster support and buy-in for the other training programs and initia-
tives to come. The specific areas to be covered in this program include:
 Assessing long-range customer-centric issues of the organization/depart-
ment and highlighting areas of strength and weakness
 Understanding the positive impact that a clear customer-satisfaction
focus will have on teamwork, productivity, and morale
 Developing specific strategies and tactics for instituting a culture of cus-
tomer service, satisfaction, and loyalty that is integrated with the cur-
rent company structure and goals
 Recognizing the role of training in the overall process and understanding
how to maximize the impact of that training
 Effecting the presentation of any relevant customer or staff survey data

Choosing a Training Method 
That Works for You
Depending on the size of your company and the resources you have available
for training, you can take three major paths toward implementing the types
of training you decide to use: classroom training, online Web-based training,
and other media-based training.
Classroom training
Classroom training is conducted in person by a professional trainer. Training
must be upbeat, highly participative, and include group discussions, team
exercises, written exercises, and role-playing, so that participants remain
attentive. The following supplies are recommended when conducting a class-
room training session:
 Workbook/materials for each participant
 Pen or pencil for each participant
 Notepaper for each participant
 Nametags or name cards for each participant
 Two flip charts
 Four black markers and two red markers
 Podium for the speaker’s notes
 Bar stool or chair for the speaker
 Water jugs and glasses (optional)
Figure 5-1 provides you with a diagram that you can use as a guideline for set-
ting up your training room.
As far as how to conduct your company’s classroom training, you can choose
between in-house programs and public courses.
In-house programs
If you want a training program that is customized specifically for your com-
pany, your best bet is to develop and conduct your own in-house training
program by using your human-resources or training department. If your com-
pany doesn’t have the resources, time, or expertise to offer this type of train-
ing, you may want to hire an outside consulting or training firm to do the job
for you.
81
Chapter 5: Company-Wide Training as a Catalyst for Change

Most established consulting firms work with you to develop and customize a
program that fits the specific needs, circumstances, and culture of your com-
pany. After the training is developed, selected members of your staff can go
through a train-the-trainer program, conducted by the consulting company,
where they find out about the content of the program and how to effectively
present it.
If you choose this route, the outside training company will charge you a pur-
chase price for using its training program. In some cases this price is a flat
fee, and in others, the rate is based on the number of participants.
If a train-the-trainer program isn’t right for you, then you can have the outside
firm develop and deliver the training program. Although doing so can become
expensive, especially when you have large numbers of staff to train, some
companies prefer this route because the outside trainer has expertise, credi-
bility, and objectivity that can be difficult to find in-house. Before hiring a con-
sulting firm — if that’s the direction you decide to take — you need to ask the
different consulting-firm candidates you interview questions like the ones we
tell you about in the sidebar “Ten questions to ask a consulting company.”

Public courses
If your company is a small business and cost is a major consideration, you
may want to send your staff to one of the many public customer-service semi-
nars that are offered. Universities and public seminar companies send out bil-
lions and billions of mailings announcing such programs. In fact, flyers for
these seminars probably land on your desk every day and end up unread in
the circular file. Public seminars are a good option for smaller businesses,
because tuition usually is a manageable $99 to $200 per person.
Public seminars have these three disadvantages:
 They’re large with up to 200 attendees, compared with the usual 20 in-
house, and you have precious little time to ask your specific questions.
 They’re generic and need to address a diverse audience, so the training
won’t be specifically tailored to your company or industry.
 They’re delivered to the lowest common denominator of attendees, so if
your staff members are more experienced, sophisticated, or more highly
trained, they may be bored or think their time is being wasted.
Online Web-based training
If you aren’t using it already, you need to plan to make online training a part
of your overall plan for education. Online training has several distinct advan-
tages, because it:
 Provides employees with 24/7 access to training materials, so they can
learn on their own schedule
 Allows management to track the participant’s progress
 Less expensive than classroom training because no venue, instructor, or
materials are required
 Enables staff members from various geographic locations to take the
training during a set time period without the time or expense of travel
Beyond just offering one or two programs, many companies and organiza-
tions now offer virtual online campuses. A campus is essentially a menu of
different training courses that can be viewed online by your staff at the time
of their choosing. Some companies even offer certificate programs for
employees who complete a prescribed set of courses.

Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization
Ten questions to ask a consulting company
Consulting companies vary greatly in the serv-
ices they offer and their ability to deliver these
services. These ten questions can help you find
a firm whose style, methods, and approach fit
with your objectives and the culture of your
company.
 Do you have any references I can call? Ask
the consulting company for a selection of
references from a variety of its clients,
including a specific contact person with
each company. Asking the consultant can-
didate to contact the persons to whom
they’re referring you, just to let them know
you’ll be calling, also is a good idea.
 What makes your firm expert in the area of
quality service? Because the topic of qual-
ity service has become so popular in the
last few years, many consulting companies
have added a customer-service training
module to their existing programs. This
addition doesn’t make them experts and
doesn’t mean they can help you implement
an entire service-improvement program
from soup to nuts. Make sure that the con-
sultants you hire are experts in customer-
service improvement by asking them
whether, for example, they:
• Conduct customer/staff surveys
• Help set up a quality group program
• Coach senior executives
Our admittedly biased experience shows
the best customer-service consulting com-
panies are the ones that offer a compre-
hensive program in customer-service
improvement and not just a one- or two-day
training program.
 What’s your company’s background?
Gather as much general information about
the consulting company as possible. Some
questions to ask include:
• How long have you been in business?
• What industries have you worked
with?
• Who are your clients?
• What’s your company philosophy?
• How many people work for you?
Don’t base your decision to hire a consult-
ing company solely on the convenience of
its geographic location. Although we real-
ize that is a consideration, don’t sell your-
self short and hire the wrong company for
the job just because it operates in the same
city that you do.
 Do you customize the training programs
and materials to match your client’s needs?
For a training program to be truly effective
for members of your staff, it must include
examples, demonstrations, and content to
which they can relate. Generic training pro-
grams usually miss the mark, because they
rely on universal examples that don’t hit
home. Ask what specific steps the consul-
tants will take to customize their programs
and materials for your company.
 Who delivers the training? Larger consult-
ing companies usually have one group of
people sell their product and a different
group delivering the training and consulta-
tion. Some businesses complain about
hiring a consulting company because they
were impressed with the salesperson but
disappointed with the consultant or trainer
who subsequently worked with them.
Although nothing is wrong with having one
person sell and another deliver the pro-
grams, you need to make sure that you can
talk to the actual person(s) who will work
directly with you.

85
Chapter 5: Company-Wide Training as a Catalyst for Change
 Can you put together a proposal for me?
Many ideas get tossed around during initial
meetings with a consulting firm. At the con-
clusion of your first meeting, however, ask
for a written proposal that outlines the
major points of your discussion and pro-
vides specifics, such as:
• How long the program will take to
implement
• How soon the program can start
• Fees
• Travel and material costs
• Maximum number of attendees
allowed in each workshop
The quality of the proposal says a lot about
the consulting company. Is it neat, correctly
spelled, and well laid out? Or does it look
haphazardly slapped together? Does it
reflect the conversation you had — or some
other meeting that you don’t remember
attending?
 How will we keep the program going in the
future? You don’t want to spend the rest of
your life depending on an outside consul-
tant to keep service training alive and well
in your company, so ask how the consulting
firm plans to empower you to maintain the
changes after its representatives have fin-
ished their work and left the scene.
Continuing the process of service improve-
ment is mostly your responsibility and not
that of the consultants. After the consulting
firm finishes its part, leaving you with the
knowledge, tools, and training you need,
keeping the program going is up to you.
 How do you deal with managers who aren’t
behind the program? A reality of imple-
menting a company-wide service-improve-
ment program is that some managers will
be more gung-ho about it than others.
Because managers are so important to the
process, finding out just what approach the
consulting company plans to take toward
convincing resistant managers to support
its program is a good idea.
 How will we get new hires up to speed? If
your company is a small business, you may
want to hire the consulting company to
come back once or twice a year and deliver
the program for your new hires. If your com-
pany is larger, conducting the customer-
service training in-house may be more
cost-effective. Find out whether the con-
sulting company has a train-the-trainer pro-
gram or video-based training for bringing
new hires up to speed.
 What do you think the most difficult part of
this project will be? At the end of the inter-
view, ask the consultants to give you their
impressions (based on what’s been dis-
cussed so far) of what they anticipate will
be the most difficult part of the project.
Make sure they explain their strategy for
overcoming this difficulty.
Asking these questions should give you an
insight into how well the consultants under-
stand your company’s issues.

If you’re in the market for online training from an outside vendor, be sure to
look for the following:
 Make sure the company that created the training has expertise in the
online programs it offers or has hired experts to create the content.
Don’t go with the generic online training mills. The quality of the infor-
mation they provide often is too simple and outdated, and they lack the
knowledge required to make a good training program.
 One measure of an effective online training program is that it’s inter-
active, not passive. The more the viewer interacts with the program, the
higher retention of the information presented. Look for programs that
are interactive with and involve the viewer as much as possible, mean-
ing the viewer can type in answers to questions, do exercises online, and
so on.
 Avoid programs that are only text based. Instead look for programs
that have flash technology and audio built into them. Flash (moving, ani-
mated graphics) and audio make a program more interesting to use.
Video clips on the other hand can be problematic because the system
the viewer is using can affect quality and download speed.
 Make sure the program has a tracking system built in that allows you
to track who has completed it. A quiz at the end the program is a plus
for testing knowledge.
Our company, Sterling Consulting Group, offers two popular online training
programs: The Service Advantage, a comprehensive customer-service-skills
program, and Essential Email, an e-mail communications course. You can
check out both of these programs at our Web site: www.scgtraining.com.

Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization
Is live better than online?
Clients often ask us whether we think live train-
ing is better than online training. Our answer is
that each has its benefits and place in an over-
all education program. Live training, particularly
when it comes to soft skills (management skills,
teambuilding, sales, customer service, and so
on), has the added benefit of group interaction
and live demonstrations that can be experi-
enced and seen. On the other hand, online train-
ing has the benefit of being cost-effective and
requires no travel. In addition, people can take
online training at their own rate of speed. Many
companies choose a combination of live and
online to get the best results overall.
However, just like any other form of training, the
quality of Web-based training can vary greatly,
so be sure to take a test ride before making any
financial commitments.

Other media-based training
The advantage of media-based training is that it doesn’t rely on a trainer’s
expertise to get the point across. These methods, which we discuss in the
upcoming sections, are particularly effective as a means of enhancing class-
room training and implementing a follow-up program.
Video
A wide range of video programs are available on the market today. The differ-
ences in quality of those programs are just as wide. Many of them are overly
simplistic, poorly produced, and, the worst crime of all, boring! The result is
a tape that doesn’t teach, enlighten, or entertain. For that reason, always pre-
view a videotape before you buy it so you’re sure of what you’re getting.
Many of the better video programs come with a leader’s guide so that a
member of your company can facilitate the program while participants watch
the tape.
You have the option of hiring a consulting company to custom design video
training for you. Although far more expensive than buying an off-the-shelf
product, the custom-designed video option has the advantage providing you
with a highly specialized product that reflects your company’s specific needs
and style. A good, customized video-training program can be used for several
years and pays for itself over time.
Audiotapes and CDs
Almost every author who has written a book on customer service offers
some kind of audiotape or CD based on either a book or a recording of an
actual seminar he or she has written or led. Audiotapes and CDs are less
expensive than videotapes and offer a greater selection of topics, and you
can easily listen wherever and whenever it’s convenient — even on the way
to work.
Books
Many good books also are available on the topic of customer service. They
fall into two categories:
 Books written by researchers and academics: Although these books
usually provide a good, solid, theoretical framework on what being cus-
tomer-focused means, they often lack real-world, practical, down-to-
earth suggestions about what to do and how to do it.
 Books full of anecdotal stories and practical tips: These tomes are writ-
ten by business people or management consultants that have plenty of
hands-on experience in customer service. They’re often light on theory,
but they contain plenty of useful ideas and examples of how to make
your company more customer-focused.
87
Chapter 5: Company-Wide Training as a Catalyst for Change

Both types of books are useful and have their places. If you’re looking for
additional books on the topic of customer service, we recommend that you
peruse your local bookstore and take some time to flip through the various
titles that are available.
CD-ROMs
Today, many large companies are using CD-ROM technology to train their
staff. CD-ROM programs usually are chock-full of information and can contain
the following:
 Video clips
 Audio
 Animated charts and graphics
If the CD-ROM program is well developed, it’ll be responsive to the learning
curve of the individual operating the program. For example, if a staff person
is moving through a program at a fast pace, the program automatically takes
him or her to a more advanced level of content. However, if the staff person
in the next cubicle runs the same program and is moving at a much slower
pace, the program focuses him or her toward the basics.
The clear advantage of using the CD-ROM approach is that it enables employ-
ees to take training at their own pace, in the comfort of their own work sta-
tions; it also is cost-effective and efficient when you have to train a large
number of people in a short period of time — especially if they’re in different
locations.
Don’t allow limited resources to keep you from training your staff. If you can’t
hire an external person and you don’t have an inside person to deliver train-
ing, use audiotapes, videotapes, and books. Review the tapes or read sec-
tions of a book with members of your staff and then discuss how they can
apply what they’re learning.
Preparing Your Staff for 
a Good Experience
Believe us when we say nothing is worse than standing in front of a roomful
of trainees who either think they’ve been sent to a training program to be
“fixed” or, worse yet, have no idea why they’re there. Too often, managers
neglect to prepare their staffs for the training they attend. Training is more of
88
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization

a positive experience and has greater impact when participants see it as part
of the overall service plan — and not just a day spent away from the office.
You can prepare your staff for training in two ways.
Sending a memo regarding the training
Send each person who will participate in training a memo at least two weeks
before he or she is scheduled to attend. The memo needs to provide the fol-
lowing information (see Figure 5-2 for an example):
 The date and time of the program
 The location of the program, including directions on how to get there, if
appropriate
 The purpose of the program and the main topics to be covered
 The dress code for the program (business, casual, or black tie!)
 Any preparation required before attending
 The instructor’s name and a brief bio, if appropriate
Some managers make a mistake of sending members of their staff to training
at the last minute without preparation. After wandering through the hallways,
they take a seat in the workshop, apologize for being late, and explain: “My
manager just told me this morning to show up. I’m not even sure why I’m
here.” Such short notice and obvious lack of preparation undermines the
importance of the training program and creates an attitude that the training
is an interruption of the staff person’s real job.
Helping your staff set training goals
A week or so before members of your staff go to training, sit down with 
them and discuss what they want to achieve. Doing so helps them clarify
their goals for the training program and provides the basis for a follow-up 
conversation.
Don’t use training as a punishment. Training should never be seen as a vehi-
cle to “fix” a broken employee. This tactic is demeaning to the staff and can
create a difficult situation for the trainer. The only effective context for send-
ing an employee to training is a positive one.

Practice Makes Perfect
How many times have you sat through a training program only to have it turn
into a distant memory soon afterward? A year later, as you’re cleaning out
your office, you run across the course workbook that has been sitting on
your shelf gathering dust, and you think:
Oh yeah, I remember when they sent me to that training program . . . what
was that about anyway?
About a month of practice is needed to turn a new skill into a habit. So now
that the formal training is over, be sure to go the distance and help members
of your staff put the skills they’ve learned into practice. By following up and
reinforcing the lessons taught in the training program, you reap the greatest
rewards for the time, money, and energy you put into training your staff.
Once is not enough. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that by sending mem-
bers of your staff to one customer-service training class they’ll be set for life.
Repeated exposure to the ideas and techniques of customer service helps
make good habits that last a lifetime. Most of our clients do some kind of
follow-up customer-service training about once a year.
Following up immediately after training
As a manager, you need to meet with each staff member two weeks after he
or she completes a training course. During the meetings, ask your employees
for their feedback on the training. Include the following questions:
 How did you like the training program?
 What did you learn?
 Did you achieve your objectives?
 What would you like to see in future training programs?
 How can I support you in practicing what you learned?
Providing ongoing coaching
Another way to reinforce what members of your staff learn from the training
is to design a plan for ongoing or continuing education. People have different
ways of learning, and what works best for one person may not work well for
another.
91
Chapter 5: Company-Wide Training as a Catalyst for Change

Find out what types of learning each member of your staff prefers. The basic
ways people learn are
 Hearing about the subject by going to lectures or listening to audiotapes
 Having a direct experience through role-playing or on-the-job practice
 Reading about the topic in books, magazines, or manuals
 Practical demonstration by watching an expert or videotape
 Talking about the subject in one-on-one or small-group situations
After you grasp the learning preferences of your individual staff members, co-
create with each person a plan for enhancing and reinforcing the concepts
and techniques that person discovered in the initial training program.
Thinking that the way you learn is the way others learn is a natural tendency;
however, that way of thinking isn’t necessarily true. Make a point of finding
out the best way to approach each of your staff members before you do any
coaching.
Creating a training library
Support members of your staff in self-education by creating a training library.
One of our clients did so by emptying a large closet, installing book shelves,
and then filling them with audiotapes, videotapes, and books on all kinds of
subjects related to training. Some of the usual topics included in a customer-
service training library are
 Communication
 Conflict resolution
 Customer service
 Dealing with difficult people
 Giving effective presentations
 Management skills
 Managing diversity
 Negotiation
 Problem-solving
 Running effective meetings
 Time management
 Total quality management
92
Part I: Creating the Customer-Centric Organization

After you have your inventory in place, the logistics of operating the training
library are easy. Simply set up a sign-in sheet (name, department, title of
item, date removed) and place a time limit on how long materials can be
checked out (two weeks is standard). After the library is set up, it takes little
work to maintain and provides the staff and managers with easy access to
learning resources.

E
ven though this book is packed with ideas you can use to rapidly and
dramatically improve the quality of service you offer your customers,
the truth of the matter is that for long-term and consistently high levels of
service, your staff needs ongoing support. We’ve seen many worthy service
improvement initiatives bite the dust through lack of follow-up. Quick fixes
are great, but they have a much longer shelf life when they’re reinforced by
coaching that provides members of your staff with feedback and keeps them
involved in the service-improvement process.
In this chapter, we look at different methods for coaching your staff, and give
you suggestions for setting up meetings that inspire participation rather than
yawns! We’ve found that service keeps getting better in companies where
managers and supervisors take on the role of a coach, so we’ve included the
know-how you need to hone this vital skill.
Meeting Up to Improve Service
Countless are the ways to get your staff excited about and participating in
service improvement. However, some of the most stellar results we’ve wit-
nessed came from short staff meetings, which were usually (though not nec-
essarily) set up by the manager. These kinds of meetings give everyone
involved an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas about specific
service-oriented subjects. You can use any or all of the five meeting themes
discussed in this section to get yourself and your team into gear.

Meeting 1: Brainstorming
Most people have been involved in some kind of formal or informal brain-
storming session, the kind where everyone gets to contribute their ideas on
the subject at hand. However, when planning a brainstorming session about
service improvement for your staff, we recommend that you take the following
actions beforehand, so your meeting is more beneficial and fun for everyone:
 Select a subject to which everyone in the room can relate. Nothing is
less inspiring for members of your staff than attending a meeting where
they have nothing to contribute because they aren’t familiar with the
issues. Pick a subject that impacts everybody’s ability to provide excel-
lent service.
 Don’t fall into the trap of judging what people say. For people to offer
input freely, they need to know that whatever they say will be accepted
openly, rather than being evaluated as to its merit. In fact, what makes
brainstorming so unique is its methodology of putting all possible ideas
on the table and not deciding whether they’re good or bad ideas until
the end of the session. If ideas are prematurely rejected, then don’t
expect people who contributed those ideas to continue contributing.
They won’t.
Many managers complain that nobody ever wants to say or contribute
anything when they get together with members of their staffs. The
reason usually is that their previous contributions have been ignored 
or shot down.
 Invite less talkative members of the group to share their thoughts. In
any meeting, some people who attend are bound to be less talkative
than others, or they just don’t do well in groups. When brainstorming, or
with any collaborative meeting, the facilitator needs to make a point of
having everyone say something. Asking a question like, “Jeff, we haven’t
heard from you yet, what are your thoughts on the subject?” is usually
enough to prime the pump.
 Manage more talkative members. Facilitating a meeting is more than
just sitting and listening — it’s also about intervening when circum-
stances demand it. When a member of the audience has a strong person-
ality or is forceful in his or her opinions, others in the group may be
uncomfortable about speaking up. We find that saying something like,
“Joe, I want to hear what you have to say, but I want a few other people
to have a chance to speak,” works well.
98
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Meeting 2: Problem-solving
The problem-solving meeting is an effective way of working with your staff on a
service problem that just won’t seem to go away. Getting input from all partici-
pants not only heightens the possibility of a great solution, it also motivates
them to successfully implement that solution. The steps of a problem-solving
meeting are:
1. Defining the problem.
This part of the process may sound like a waste of time, but it’s actually
one of the most important parts of the problem-solving process. By
accurately defining the problem so that it precisely states the issue that
needs to be fixed, you can be more exact when focusing on possible
solutions.
2. Brainstorming possible solutions (see the previous section).
3. Evaluating possible solutions.
Some of the solutions the team devises are better than others and must
be evaluated for how feasible they are to implement. This step helps you
eliminate solutions that look good on paper but won’t work in reality.
99
Chapter 6: Coaching Service Excellence
Brainstorming primer
Brainstorming is a technique designed to
express as many different ideas about a spe-
cific subject as possible. The focus isn’t on the
quality of ideas but rather on the quantity.
Criticism or evaluation is the enemy of brain-
storming, because it can stop people from think-
ing creatively and speaking freely.
By giving people free reign to express their
ideas, brainstorming taps into less traditional
and more innovative ideas. Guidelines for brain-
storming include the following:
 Accepting only one thought at a time. Some
groups do better taking turns, others prefer
to be more random.
 Never criticizing ideas.
 Never discussing ideas — except for 
clarification.
 Encouraging people to build on the ideas of
others in the group.
 Recording ideas on a flip chart and display-
ing full pages so they’re visible to everyone
in the group.

You can count on different degrees of agreement and enthusiasm from
group members as you go through this step. For example, members who
are detail-oriented may want to dwell on certain issues while others who
see a bigger picture won’t want to dwell on details that they find boring
and insignificant. These two different perspectives can create a synergy
where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Remember that
your job as facilitator is to respect each person’s point of view, ask ques-
tions that reveal assumptions, and help your group move forward.
4. Coming up with an implementation plan.
Once a solution (or solutions) has been agreed upon, create a checklist
of who is going to do what and by when that work is to be done. As the
coach (and manager) you probably need to follow up and make sure
that those tasks are fulfilled by the time promised.
If you don’t follow up on the implementation plan, you send a message
that nobody is responsible and that it doesn’t really matter, one way or
the other, whether the solution is implemented.
Meeting 3: Creating service enhancers
Service enhancers are specific moments of truth (see Chapter 2) that you
select and then enhance to create a positive impression with your customers.
For example, if new customers contact you mostly by phone, you may need
to work on enhancing their first impression when they call. Doing so may
involve how you greet them, how you put them on hold, and so on. By work-
ing on service enhancers in a group meeting, the diverse opinions of different
members can help you discover overlooked or less obvious ways of making
your service shine.
We’ve discovered that the following steps make the process of creating serv-
ice enhancers easy for everyone to follow:
1. Choosing a cycle of service.
A cycle of service is a phase in the service delivery cycle, somewhat like
a chapter in a book. Say, for example, that you operate a bicycle repair
shop. Your cycles of service (excuse the pun) may be:
1. Customer contacting you about a repair
2. Booking the repair
3. Completing the repair
4. Customer picking up repaired bicycle
100
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

2. Breaking down the cycle you’ve chosen into specific moments of
truth.
Within each cycle are specific moments of truth when you have an
opportunity to make a positive impression with the customer. For exam-
ple, if you decided to work on the cycle when the customer picks up the
repaired bicycle in this example, you can break it down into the follow-
ing moments of truth:
1. Notifying the customer when the bike is ready
2. Customer picking up the repaired bike
3. Customer paying for the repairs
3. Selecting one moment of truth.
Ask the group which moment of truth has the most potential for
improvement. Doing so may lead to a discussion in which you end up
with more than one possible moment. When that happens, choose one
to work on now and save the other(s) for future service-improvement
sessions. At this point, assume that the group chose “Customer paying
for the repairs” from the list above.
4. Enhancing the selected moment of truth.
Now ask members of the group for ideas for enhancing this experience
for the customer. Possible enhancers may include:
• Giving clients a discount card for 10 percent off any additional
items purchased within the next two weeks
• Presenting clients with small laminated cards with recommended
weekly bicycle maintenance tips
• Asking clients whether they’d like a courtesy call the next time
their bike is due for a service
5. Devising an action plan.
This final step takes the results from the meeting and turns them into a
workable reality. People volunteer their expertise and know-how to take
on specific tasks associated with the chosen enhancer.
Meeting 4: Planning service recovery
If your business is prone to frequent service breakdowns — for example,
deadlines that are frequently not met because of the unpredictability of a
supplier — then this meeting is a great way to involve the members of your
team in service improvement, challenging them to come up with ideas for
service recovery.
101
Chapter 6: Coaching Service Excellence

As we mention in Chapter 16, an important aspect of service recovery is
offering a care token. A care token is something you do to let the customer
know that you’re sorry for the problem and are committed to keeping her
business.
When you experience frequent service breakdowns that are similar in nature,
coming up with a standard and uniform way of dealing with them makes
sense. Doing so makes the situation less stressful for your staff by providing
an agreed upon procedure and creating consistency for staff and customers.
Here’s an idea of what we’re talking about: Coauthor Keith Bailey recently
sent an overnight package to an associate on the East Coast. When the pack-
age didn’t arrive, Keith called up the express shipping company to trace it.
The agent answering the phone politely explained that the package had been
held up because of a large snowstorm. She apologized but couldn’t predict
when it would be delivered given the weather conditions. The agent had been
well trained in handling regular winter service breakdowns. That was obvi-
ous, because she knew exactly what to say and exactly how to say it, which
made Keith feel taken care of even though she couldn’t resolve the issue.
Meeting 5: Listen and learn sessions
This meeting has one purpose: A manager listens to the feedback from his
staff. We have facilitated many of these meetings, and you’d be surprised how
difficult just listening to what staff members have to say — without respond-
ing, explaining, defending, or refuting — can be for a manager.
Choose a subject about which you want to gain some insight. For example, 
if you’re the manager of a help desk, you may want to discover what your
department can do better to speed up response time to customer requests.
Informing people about the subject of the meeting is a good idea, because
they then have time to think about their feedback. At the start of the meeting,
explain that your job is just to listen, because you really want to know what
they have to say.
Don’t be tempted to talk back except for purposes of clarification. If someone
either states as fact something you know to be untrue, offers an opinion
about you that is negative, or presents an idea that you find preposterous,
don’t react. Bite your tongue and keep on listening.
After the meeting, it’s important to use the feedback for positive improve-
ment. If nothing happens, the listen and learn sessions were a waste of time,
and your staff will be less likely to contribute next time. We recommend cre-
ating a steering committee, or group of interested volunteers, to sift through
102
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

all the feedback, classify it into broad headings, and then prioritize what
should be worked on first. A memo outlining this information should be sent
to all those who contributed their time and opinion.
Taking a Three-Stage Coaching Approach
Although meetings outlined in the previous section are effective ways of get-
ting everyone involved in the service-improvement process, coaching often
requires a more personal, one-on-one approach. For that reason, each man-
ager needs to know how to prepare and facilitate such coaching sessions.
Coaching means working with members of your staff in a collaborative way.
By asking questions that give rise to discussion or suggesting alternative
approaches, managers and their staffs share the discovery of new ways of
improving service delivery. If you live in fear of leading a coaching session —
or have tried but failed in the past — read on. In this section, we break down
the coaching process into three stages that remove the mystery and increase
your mastery.
Stage 1: Preparing yourself for coaching
If you volunteered to coach the junior soccer league, you’d probably do some
preparation before arriving at the field. If you were asked to make a presenta-
tion at your firm’s annual conference, you might stay up all night making sure
you were ready and well prepared. Coaching your staff is no different, and
because it’s a skill that most of us have to learn, preparation is the first step
toward mastery. Preparing to coach service excellence means two things:
 Knowing your strengths and weaknesses so you’re better prepared
 Knowing how members of your staff learn so you can coach them in the
most effective ways
Determining your strengths and weaknesses
You can determine your coaching strengths and weaknesses by rating your
responses to the ten statements in the survey that follows. These statements
are designed to show you — and get you thinking about — where you may
need to place extra emphasis when conducting your coaching sessions. As
you read each statement ask yourself, “How would my staff rate me?” and
resist the urge to look good and score the right answer. Use the questionnaire
as an opportunity to assess your strengths and to find out where you can use
some improvement.
103
Chapter 6: Coaching Service Excellence

To analyze your coaching strengths and weaknesses:
Rate how frequently you make use of the techniques described by each 
of the following ten statements about coaching according to these values:
1 = Rarely, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Frequently. Place your score in the blank
provided after each statement, and then add them together to get your
score. Be honest with yourself.
When coaching (or working with my staff) I:
1. Solicit their input and listen to their ideas.
_____
2. Take time to develop an environment of trust.
_____
3. Make my expectations and priorities clear.
_____
4. Look for positives rather than negatives.
_____
5. Give credit when it’s deserved.
_____
6. Know how to be direct without being personal.
_____
7. Hold employees accountable for their results.
_____
8. Rarely give up on an employee.
_____
9. Always start by reviewing the “big picture.”
_____
10. Know what results I want to accomplish.
_____
Total of all scores =
_____
Evaluating your score
Scoring this survey highlights areas where you have strong skills and
shows you weaker areas of which you need to be mindful when conduct-
ing the coaching session. If you scored:
25–30: You have excellent coaching skills — or terrible math skills. This
score signifies that you have a collaborative working style, and coaching
probably comes easy to you. Look at the one or two areas where you
scored less than 3 and focus on honing those skills.
15–24: You have above-average coaching skills, but you can use some
refinement. Look at the values you gave each statement and determine in
which one or two areas you scored low and then work on them. However,
if you want to score more 3s, you can use this chapter to brush up all
your skills.
Less than 15: Read this chapter twice! You probably have had little expo-
sure to effective coaching, so the skills and techniques we describe in
this chapter can have a positive impact on how you relate to your staff —
and your levels of service.
104
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Think of coaching as an approach rather than a series of techniques. For exam-
ple, coaching is usually more effective when the approach is collaborative,
where you and your staff members have partnerships based on mutual under-
standing and trust. If you adopt this approach when working with your staff to
improve service, the techniques you use will be that much more effective.
The next part of preparing yourself is gaining an understanding that not
everyone learns in the same way.
Knowing how members of your staff learn
Different people learn in different ways. For example, when you’re handed a
new project, you may be the kind of person who thrives by being left alone to
figure out what and how you’re going to accomplish the task. Someone else
who’s just as competent as you may struggle needlessly if you incorrectly
assume that he or she also likes the same hands-off approach. Spending a
little time thinking about the people you’re about to coach can expedite the
learning process and minimize everyone’s frustration.
In the following example, Judy is a customer-service manager who is coaching
Jim, one of her customer-service reps, to better deal with angry customers.
Judy must first reflect on how Jim learns, and then she must coach him using
one or more of these methods:
 Learning by experience. This type of learning takes place by trial and
error. The individual tries something, corrects any failures, and cele-
brates the successes.
For example: Judy suggests that Jim learn by experience and then report
back to her to talk about what worked well — and what didn’t.
105
Chapter 6: Coaching Service Excellence
Anyone can dance — it just takes time
Until two years ago, coauthor Keith Bailey
believed he couldn’t dance. He attended a
beginner’s class and, unable to follow the
teacher’s instructions, grew frustrated and
embarrassed and ran out of the studio as fast as
his two left feet would carry him. Then a friend
suggested that he may be learning dance the
wrong way; that he may need a teacher who
enables him to experience the movements
slowly rather than relying on observing a role
model — the dance teacher — showing him the
steps. Keith took the friend’s advice and found
a beginner’s class that taught the same basic
steps every week. After a few weeks and sev-
eral jokes about the Groundhog Day dance
class, Keith could salsa alongside the best of
them.

This technique is not the same as the sink-or-swim approach that is all
too rampant in organizations that throw people in the deep end but
don’t offer them a life preserver when the waters get choppy. In experi-
ential learning, the employee feels supported at all times by a structure
that makes sure his head never goes under the waterline.
 Observing role models. Many people learn best by watching others
around them who have developed skills in the area they want to improve.
For example: Judy suggests Jim work alongside Alice — the department’s
bomb defuser — who can calm the most irate of customers. By observing
what Alice says, and how she says it, Jim picks up valuable information.
 Taking passive instruction. This type of learning is accomplished by
reading a book, listening to an instructor or a CD, or watching a DVD.
For example: Judy suggests that Jim read Chapter 16 of this book. To
maximize Jim’s learning experience, Judy sets up another meeting so
they can discuss what Jim learned and any questions he may have, after
he reads the chapter.
 Relying on reflection and discussion. Some people learn best by having
discussions that present new ideas or different viewpoints either in
groups or one-on-one.
For example: Judy meets with Jim and a few colleagues and invites people
to share their experiences — both good and bad — about dealing with
upset customers. She asks Jim to share what he has learned so far.
Stage 2: Preparing the coaching session
After you prepare yourself to coach, you’re ready to prepare the session. 
This process consists of the three steps that are discussed in the following
sections.
Step 1: Notifying and preparing participants
Some people hear the word “coaching” and think “Oh-oh, I’m going to be rep-
rimanded.” Banish this thought from the minds of your staff members by
giving them plenty of notice that you plan to conduct a coaching session —
at least a week’s advance notice. If you notify them by e-mail, we recommend:
 Telling them what you want to accomplish in the session. Word the
e-mail in a positive and collaborative way. For example, if you’re meeting
with your staff members to reduce customer complaints, explain that
you’d like their input and feedback regarding customer complaints and
their ideas for improving the way they’re addressed.
 Asking them to prepare for the meeting ahead of time by bringing
written suggestions or ideas to discuss.
106
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

 Asking everyone to think about times when they were a customer
with a complaint and received exceptional treatment from another
company. What did the customer-service representative do or say that
made it so memorable?
 Noting the date, time, duration, and location of the session. Ask every-
one to arrive five minutes early so the meeting can start promptly.
Step 2: Setting up the physical location
The location of the meeting needs to be:
 Private. As we’ve already mentioned, success in coaching is partly a
function of trust. The location can enhance this feeling by being away
from high-traffic areas and free from distractions.
 Interruption free. If the room in which you plan to meet has telephones,
make sure to forward any incoming calls to those phones somewhere
else during your meeting. Nothing is more disturbing than a constantly
ringing phone. Have all who attend turn off their cellphones or switch
them to vibrate, and tape a notice to the door asking not to be disturbed.
 Organized. Make sure you have the correct number of chairs facing for-
ward (or in a circle). Neatly place any other debris, such as computer
terminals, unwanted overhead projectors, extra chairs, telephones, and
so on, against a far wall out of the way.
Likewise, prepare any materials you may need and have them ready to
go. Handouts need to be copied, collated, and ready to be distributed;
overhead presentations need to be in order and ready; and computer
projectors need to be humming along and ready to rip. If your partici-
pants need pens, pencils, and notepaper, have them ready to hand out.
We know from years of working with people in rooms of varying sizes (little-
to-large) all around the world that the more attention and awareness that’s
given to the physical surroundings, the more members of your group (usually
without realizing it) will feel supported and safe.
Step 3: Creating an agenda
Even though coaching is a dynamic process that usually doesn’t follow a
straight course, setting down a series of steps that you plan to follow never-
theless is important during any service-improvement meeting. The basic
parts of an agenda are included (start-to-finish) in the list that follows. They
are the same regardless of whether you’re planning a one-on-one or a group
session. Use each agenda item as a guideline and feel free to elaborate on
each of them, depending on the needs of your session. Allow time for the 
following:
107
Chapter 6: Coaching Service Excellence

1. Greeting and thanking everyone for attending.
Let them know that you appreciate their time.
2. Stating the purpose of the meeting and what you’d like to accomplish.
3. Eliciting feedback and opinions about the topic.
4. Discussing and clarifying the issues.
5. Summarizing the feedback from Steps 3 and 4 and asking for ideas for
improving the situation.
Be encouraging no matter how outlandish the suggestions.
6. Agreeing on what needs to be done.
Hint: This step often takes the biggest chunk of time.
7. Writing down all agreed upon action steps while noting who you’re
expecting to get the jobs done and when they need to be finished.
8. Concluding and summarizing the meeting.
Stage 3: Conducting the coaching session
The make-it-or-break-it part of a service-improvement coaching session is
how well you give and receive feedback. More times than not, you end up
having to tell someone about a behavior or an attitude that is counterproduc-
tive and far from customer friendly. Giving this kind of feedback is difficult for
many managers, and if it comes out wrong or is misconstrued, the people
you’re meeting with may become upset and defensive.
The list that follows includes five tips — using the example of a rental-car
agency supervisor coaching one of her counter agents — for delivering feed-
back that ensures your coaching sessions have an excellent chance of being
received in the spirit of appreciation and growth rather than anger and
blame. When giving feedback, you must:
 Get the conversation off on the right foot by starting with open-ended
questions.
For example: “Rose, I wanted to meet with you to discuss some ways we
can improve check-in wait times. What have you noticed that slows
down the process?”
Open-ended questions usually begin with words like what, where, when,
how, and why. By asking Rose the open-ended question, “What have you
noticed that slows down the process?” the supervisor opens the door
for a two-way dialogue. Because coaching is a collaborative process, get-
ting people involved in the conversation early on creates trust.
108
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Imagine how different the conversation would be if the supervisor asked
a closed-ended question (beginning with do, will, can, and so on) such 
as: “Rose, I need to improve check-in wait times. Do you have any ideas?”
Closed-ended questions tend to illicit one-word answers, and in this case,
if Rose answers “No,” the conversation may be over.
 Sandwich small bits of criticism between large pieces of praise.
For example: “Rose, I really appreciate all the extra care you take with
customers and your ability to deal so well with all sorts of different per-
sonalities. Yesterday you seemed a little more stressed than usual; I
noticed you lost your temper with one customer. What was going on?
Usually you’re so calm.”
By sincerely accentuating strengths, the supervisor boosts the staff
person’s morale and makes it clear that what she brings to her job is far
greater than yesterday’s incident. The staff person is left feeling bigger
rather than smaller.
 Start with general feedback and then move to specific behaviors.
For example: “Rose, as you know, we all tend to go a little nuts around
the holidays when rental activity is at its peak. I’ve been doing this job
for three years, and I still get caught up in the frenzy. I wanted to talk
with you a little bit about making sure you don’t pass that feeling on 
to the customers and give him or her the impression that we’re being
sloppy or rushed. Specifically, I noticed that several of your lease agree-
ments had some key information missing, and that’s unusual for you.”
In this scenario the supervisor softened the feedback by including her
own shortcomings in the general situation and then transitioned into
how the holiday rush may be affecting Rose’s work. Rose’s behavior was
normalized while still needing to be corrected.
 Use more “I” statements than “you” statements to reduce defensiveness.
For example: “Rose, I think it’s important that we wear our nametags —
even during breaks. I’d like you to keep yours on when you’re in this
building.”
Compare the above statement with the following version, which accen-
tuates the “you” more than the “I.”
“Rose, you haven’t been wearing your nametag when you’re on a break.
You have to wear it any time you’re in this building.”
In the first interaction, the supervisor talks from her own point-of-view
about the situation, which focuses less attention on Rose’s behavior and
consequently produces less defensiveness. Likewise, speaking from an
“I” rather than a “you” perspective makes maintaining a calm tone of
voice much easier for the supervisor.
109
Chapter 6: Coaching Service Excellence

 Mutually agree on any action items.
For example: “Just to recap, Rose, you will give me your list of recom-
mendations by 4 p.m. Tuesday, and I will set up a meeting to discuss
them with you by the end of the following day.”
Agreeing on the action items at the end of the session makes everyone
responsible for the promises they have made and stops any misunder-
standings about who is going to do what by when.
Do’s and Don’ts for Dealing with 
Difficult Coaching Situations
From time to time you may be in a situation in which someone becomes
angry and hostile. Whenever that happens, the following guidelines can help
you respond:
 Do empathize/don’t defend. Often the easiest and most effective way to
avoid a confrontation is to let the person (or persons, if it’s a group)
know that you understand and sincerely appreciate her frustration or
point-of-view.
 Do admit when you don’t know/don’t pretend to know. If you’re asked
a question and you don’t know the answer, please don’t pretend that
you do and make something up. You experience no shame in saying you
don’t know and offering to find the answer. If someone in the group
knows the answer, redirect the question to that person.
 Do make eye contact/don’t stare them down. Making eye contact with
an upset group member lets that person know that you can deal with the
interruption and that you’re interested in (rather than intimidated by)
what he or she is saying. However, breaking eye contact when you
answer the individual and redirecting your attention to the others in the
room is a good idea. Doing so enables you to include everyone in the
interaction and to avoid a stare down that usually results in an escala-
tion of hostility.
 Do listen to the intent/don’t just hear the words. When someone asks a
challenging question, hearing only the words and the tone of voice may
lead you to think that the confrontation is with you personally. Usually it
isn’t. By listening to the intent behind the words, you can avoid the trap
of becoming defensive or argumentative and thereby address what
they’re really reacting to.

What You Can Measure, You Can
Manage: Service Standards
In This Chapter
 Defining general service qualities
 Establishing effective standards
 Getting a grasp of how customers score your service
 Creating standards in four easy steps
A
company we once worked with balked at the idea of having everyone in
the company answer the phone with the same greeting. “Won’t this make
us sound like robots to our customers?” the staff moaned. We assured them
that customers see standards as evidence of service consistency and reliabil-
ity, so they didn’t need to worry about sounding artificial to customers. A few
months later, we conducted a survey for the same company, and many cus-
tomers had positive comments about the new phone standards and praised
the company for its efforts.
Service standards serve two purposes. They’re a powerful way of shaping the
image that your customers have of you and a great management tool for mea-
suring how well each person in your company meets the levels of service to
which you aspire. In our view, too few companies have meaningful standards,
simply because they don’t know how to translate a general service quality
into a specific service standard.
In this chapter, we show you how to create and implement measurable serv-
ice standards.
You Can’t Measure Friendly
General service qualities can be defined by adjectives that describe the basic
ways you want your staff (and managers) to treat your customers, including:

 Friendly
 Courteous
 Efficient
 Pleasant
 Responsive
 Helpful
 Caring
 Prompt
Companies often write policies proclaiming how members of your staff need
to exhibit these qualities. For example:
When greeting customers, act in a friendly way.
Be prompt in responding to customers’ requests.
When dealing with upset customers, show them that you care.
Although these goals all are worthy, they mean different things to different
people. If you ask ten staff members to define being friendly to a customer,
you get ten different answers. General service qualities, such as friendliness,
are not specific or measurable, and they therefore are open to individual
interpretation.
Service qualities are important because they provide your staff with general
guidelines to follow in unpredictable situations for which no specific service
standards have been set. However, if these qualities are going to be consis-
tently put into practice, they must be made measurable.
You Can Measure Smiles
Service standards go one step further by turning general service qualities
into specific, measurable actions that you expect your staff to take in given
situations. For your staff to understand what you mean by friendly service,
you must break the definition down into the components that make up
friendly, such as:
 Smiling at customers as they approach
 Making direct eye contact while explaining the situation
 Greeting customers by saying “Good morning” or “Good afternoon”
 Using the customer’s name at least twice during the conversation
112
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

By taking these observable actions, members of your staff convey friendli-
ness to your customers. Table 7-1 lists some examples of how general service
qualities can be turned into specific service standards. The measurable
aspect of each standard is in bold type.

Criteria for Effective Service Standards
Seven criteria make a service standard effective. We recommend that you
review your current standards against this list and revamp the ones that need
it. Effective standards need to be
 Specific: Standards tell service people precisely and exactly what is
expected of them. Customers don’t have to guess about your expecta-
tions or make anything up.
 Concise: Standards don’t explain the philosophy behind the action.
Instead, they get right to the point and spell out who needs to do what
by when.
 Measurable: Because actions in a standard are all specific criteria, they
are observable and objective, which makes them easy to quantify.
 Based on customer requirements: Standards need to be based on cus-
tomer requirements and not just your industry’s standards. Fulfilling
your customers’ expectations gives you an advantage over competitors
that do not.
113
Chapter 7: What You Can Measure, You Can Manage: Service Standards

 Written into job descriptions and performance reviews: If you want
employees to adhere to the standards, then write them down and make
them part of each employee’s job description and performance review.
Using standards as a management tool gives them more credibility.
 Jointly created with your staff: The best standards are created by man-
agement and staff together based on their mutual understanding of 
customer needs. You may want to consider using quality groups (see
Chapter 9) as a vehicle for having members of your staff come up with
service standards.
 Fairly enforced: Standards that are enforced with some people and not
with others quickly erode. Company-wide standards require everybody
to conform to them, including the top brass. Department-specific stan-
dards apply to everyone within that department, including the manager.
Acing the Invisible Score Card
How do customers judge the service they receive from you? Customers, it
seems, have an invisible mental score card on which they continually judge
your service. Based on our research, your company is being evaluated in
three basic areas:
 Product quality
 Ease of procedures
 Personal contact quality
Because these qualities are fundamental to your customers’ experiences while
doing business with you, we strongly recommend that you develop service
standards in all three areas.
Exploring product quality
Product quality refers to the physical quality of the product you produce. In a
service business, the product is only one aspect of the customer’s overall
experience. When eating out, for example, the product is the food you’re
served. You evaluate the restaurant based on the way the food is cooked,
how it tastes, and the way it’s presented. Examples of product quality stan-
dards at a restaurant may include:
 All vegetables must be purchased and served fresh daily.
 Two ounces of bay shrimp accompany each house salad.
 All entree dishes must have a fresh-fruit garnish.
114
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Making procedures easy
Ease-of-procedure standards make doing business with you and your com-
pany easy, fast, and efficient for your customer. In a restaurant, excellent food
is only part of the picture. Customers also expect not to have to wait too long
for their meals or their checks. Some typical procedural standards in a
restaurant may include:
 Bringing all food to the table within three minutes of it being prepared.
 Setting up a baby seat before escorting a party with a small child to their
table.
 Picking up a check within two minutes of payment being placed on the
table by the customer.
Enriching personal contact
Standards for the quality of personal contact include the attitudes, actions, and
behaviors that you expect your staff to show your customers. Your restaurant
experience — no matter how mouthwateringly delicious the food — can be

The Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award
The Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award was cre-
ated by an act of Congress in 1987. According
to the application guidelines, the award is
designed to promote:
 Awareness of quality as an increasingly
important element in competitiveness
 Understanding of the requirements for qual-
ity excellence
 Sharing of information on successful quality
strategies
Every year, hundreds of large and small busi-
nesses alike complete an application, hoping to
win this award, which is one of the most presti-
gious that a business can receive. Past winners
include such companies as Xerox, Motorola,
Federal Express, and Cadillac.
The award is based on seven categories of cri-
teria with customer satisfaction leading the
pack. Fewer than 30 percent of the companies
that apply are service businesses. For the ser-
vice companies that do apply, standards is an
area in which they typically receive the lowest
ratings, because they’re too general, not mea-
surable, and not based on customer require-
ments. Service businesses, in general, seem to
focus on communicating general service quali-
ties to their staff but not specific service 
standards.

make this experience positive include:
 Greeting customers with a smile and saying, “Good evening. Welcome to

 Asking whether customers have any questions about the menu before
taking their order.
 Saying, “Thank you for dining with us tonight. We look forward to seeing
you again,” as you hand the customer the check.
Developing Service Standards 
in Four Simple Steps
The key to developing service standards is organizing the process into bite-
sized pieces. We discuss each of the four steps for developing standards in
this section.
Step 1: Defining your service sequences
Viewing your business as a series of separate but connected interactions can
help you define and understand what we call service sequences.
Service sequences are to your business what chapters are to a book. They’re
a way of conveniently subdividing the aspects of your service so you can dis-
cover specific customer encounters that require standards. For example, if
you’re in the hotel business, your basic service sequence may go something
like this:
Reservations
Check in
Use the room
Check out
Viewing your service sequences from your customer’s perspective is impor-
tant. If customers look at your business as separate chunks, what do they
see? Not all of the services you provide follow precisely one after the other,
so the important thing to do is to subdivide your business into the different
aspects of the services you provide.
116
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Step 2: Mapping out the steps
After you break your business services up into various chapters, choose one
area that needs improvement (as indicated by customer feedback). You need
to map out the major steps that make up that particular customer encounter
chronologically (like the paragraphs within a chapter). For example, the
check-in sequence for a hotel includes the following steps:
1. Guest approaches the front desk.
2. Desk clerk asks for the guest’s name.
3. Desk clerk pulls the guest’s reservation from the file (hopefully).
4. Desk clerk asks what form of payment the guest will use.
5. Guest is given a room key and directions to the elevator.
In this encounter, no value is added to the basic interaction. It simply is an
accurate, step-by-step process that probably reflects how every hotel in the
world checks in a guest. Thus to be able to add value to the guest’s experi-
ence of staying at this particular hotel, you need to define key experience
enhancers.
As in life, basic service sequences don’t always go as planned. Our hotel
guest may have made a reservation, but the desk clerk may not be able to
find it in the system. In that situation, the clerk deviates from the normal
sequence of events and goes off onto a new branch of the service sequence.
Regardless of how many twists and turns there are, the basic process for
developing standards is the same.
Step 3: Determining your 
experience enhancers
For each individual step of your service sequences, ask yourself:
What general service qualities will enhance the customer’s experience of
doing business with my company during this step?
As your “guest approaches the front desk” in the first step of the check-in
sequence, your actions are critical, because they make an immediate first
impression on the guest. Two of the most important general service qualities
at this point are being friendly and attentive to the guest.
117
Chapter 7: What You Can Measure, You Can Manage: Service Standards

Make sure you carry out this same procedure for each step of each service
sequence you want to improve until you determine the key experience-
enhancing qualities for each step.
Step 4: Converting your experience
enhancers into standards
After discovering how you can enhance the quality of service in a given
sequence, you can then rewrite the step-by-step interaction by converting
your general service qualities into the three types of service standards: per-
sonal, product, and procedural (see the earlier section on “Acing the Invisible
Score Card”). In the hotel example, you can rewrite the sequence for check-
ing in a guest to reflect these important standards:
 Promptness: When more than three people are waiting in line, call the
desk supervisor for assistance.
 Friendliness: Smile at the customer as he or she approaches the front
desk, make direct eye contact, and say “Good morning,” “Good after-
noon,” or “Good evening.”
 Recognition and attentiveness: Use the guest’s name as soon as you
know it.
 Initiative: Ask the guest whether he or she would like a wake-up call in
the morning.
 Quality assurance: Call the guest within 15 minutes of checking in to
make sure that everything in the room is satisfactory.
As your business grows and changes, remember to periodically update your
standards. Don’t get stuck defining one set of standards and keeping them for
life. You need to review your standards at least once a year and update them
as necessary to reflect changes in your market and your business.

Chapter 8
Beyond Employee of the Month:
Reward and Recognition
In This Chapter
 Informally recognizing and praising your staff, even on a budget
 Exploring five ways to formally reward members of your staff
A
ll people have a natural need to feel good about the jobs they do.
According to a recent Gallup survey of more than 80,000 employees,
reward and recognition ranked as key factors in customer satisfaction,
employee retention, productivity, and profitability. By regularly rewarding
and recognizing members of your staff when they do something right, rather
than noticing and commenting only when they do something wrong, you help
motivate them to keep up the good work. You can let your staff know they’ve
done a good job in two ways:
 Informal recognition: This spontaneous, everyday type of recognition
lets members of your staff know that you appreciate the jobs they’re
doing, and best of all, it takes little time, money, or planning to execute.
 Formal reward program: This preplanned, company-wide program
rewards individuals, departments, and teams for achieving outstanding
results in customer service. In general, these programs take time, money,
and a good deal of planning to implement.
An outdated, yet not uncommon attitude that we often come across in our
work is that if you’re paying employees for the work they do, why do you
need to reward or recognize them further? Some managers and supervisors
believe that their staffs shouldn’t need many strokes or attaboys, because
they receive financial compensation for doing their jobs well. That simply is
not true. Research and experience show that people thrive when they receive
personal recognition for the work they do. Although a paycheck is important,
it never replaces the need for genuine appreciation for the efforts your staff
members put in. Although everyone is, of course, expected to do their jobs
well, recognition encourages and motivates staff members to exceed what is
expected of them.

Informal Recognition
Studies show that regularly giving informal recognition to an employee is a
stronger motivator than providing him or her with formal rewards. Simple
praise is remembered long after the event, because it tells your employees
that you noticed their efforts and took the time to personally thank them.
If your heart is in the right place and you follow these recommendations, we
promise that your praise will be warmly appreciated by others.
Basic praise primer
Although informal recognition is effective, inexpensive, and convenient, many
managers don’t give members of their staffs as many pats on the back as they
could. Consequently, when they praise their staffs, the managers’ inexperience
(and often awkwardness) can be interpreted as a lack of genuine appreciation.
We set matters straight in this section by cluing you in to a few basic skills
that can complement your compliments.
Always reward the behavior that you want repeated. When members of your
staff receive positive feedback, they look for ways to repeat the behavior.
Sincere praise is the best way to ensure that good service habits stick.
Don’t do it in the hallway
Before you praise someone, always make sure that you have his or her full
attention. Don’t try to give your staff a compliment when they (or you) are
scurrying down the corridor, rushing to a meeting, or trying to meet a dead-
line. Instead, set up a time and place that is convenient for them. If you’re
acknowledging a team of people for their efforts, set up a time when you can
meet with all of them in one place so you can praise them as a group.
Go to them
Talk to your members of your staff on their own turf or in a place where they
feel comfortable and relaxed, such as at their desks or in the lunchroom.
Don’t ask them to come to your office because they may mistakenly think
that something is wrong.
Maintain eye contact
Because people can perceive lack of eye contact to mean insincerity, deceit,
or dishonesty, looking at your employees when you recognize them is criti-
cal. On the other hand, your employees probably are going to look away from
you, because they haven’t likely had much practice at accepting honest,
straightforward praise.
120
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

You don’t want to be standing up and looking down on your staff when you
praise them. The trick is to stay level with them, perhaps by taking a seat
next to them.
Don’t delay
You need to recognize your staff as quickly as possible after the achievement
has occurred to have the biggest impact. Don’t wait until the holiday party to
praise the heroes of last spring. The further away you get from the event, the
less impact the acknowledgment has.
The most heartfelt praise misses its mark whenever your tone of voice does
not convey genuine enthusiasm. Your level of excitement, in addition to your
words, tells your staff how you really feel.
Recognition thought starters
Although you may like nothing better than to show your appreciation to serv-
ice heroes by sending them to Hawaii, you have many other avenues of recog-
nition to pursue without them costing an arm and a leg. The simplest, most
spontaneous ideas often yield the best results and the most fun. You can use
the following checklists to find a form of recognition that fits the employee,
your budget, and the occasion. The checklists are divided into three price
categories.
Ideas that cost less than $25
When your gut’s telling you to praise your employees, but your budget cries
out, “I don’t have the money,” there’s still hope. Here are a few suggestions
that’ll cost you little or nothing to try:
 Send a thank-you note. You can personally hand the note to your staff
person, leave it for him to find on his desk, or tape it to the door of his
office. Make sure the employee knows the specific actions for which you
are thanking him.
We know it’s tempting to send an e-mail rather than a letter — but it 
isn’t recommended. E-mails are too casual and run-of-the-mill and 
often aren’t read. If you really want your thank-you to count, do it the
old-fashioned way.
 Have a senior executive personally thank the employee. This form of
praise always is special, because members of your staff know that an
executive’s time is a precious commodity, and they’ll know that you’ve
passed on the positive feedback. If possible, have the employee and
executive meet face to face. If you can’t work out such an arrangement,
then a telephone call will do. In addition, make sure the executive is 
121
Chapter 8: Beyond Employee of the Month: Reward and Recognition

well briefed on what the service person did and why his or her action
deserves special recognition. Be sure to ask the senior executive in
charge of your department to recognize your employee.
 Send a letter of praise from a senior executive. This alternative to a
personal visit or a phone call has an added advantage, because the
letter can be placed in the employee’s personnel file. This option differs
slightly from a thank-you note, because it comes from a senior executive,
not the immediate supervisor or manager.
 Create a hall of fame for service heroes. Use a lunchroom wall or
another area that is routinely seen by everyone and put up postcard-size
photos of your service heroes. We recommend that you update the pho-
tographs with new service heroes every month or two. Include a short
caption beneath each picture about what the person did to earn a place
on the wall.
 Display customers’ letters of praise. Similar to the hall of fame, pick a
common area that is traveled by everyone to show off framed letters of
praise that customers send to staff.
 Highlight service heroes in the company newsletter. Regularly dedi-
cate a part of your company newsletter to recognizing service heroes.
Include a brief description of their achievements in the article.
Create an award for people who aren’t usually in the limelight. This award
can be any form of recognition that you choose, but it needs to have a spe-
cific name and be given to people whose work is usually out of sight or low
profile. Call it something like the Backroom Award, make a big deal about it,
and present it on a regular basis (once a month or quarter).
Ideas that cost less than $50
Getting accounting to let the purse strings out slightly enables a little more
creativity in terms of the type of recognition you can give to members of your
staff. Here are a few great ways to recognize hard-working employees for
fewer than 50 bucks:
 Lunchtime pizza party. Send out for pizzas and soft drinks and have
them waiting in the lunchroom for your team or department — do this
on a Friday so you can end the week on a high note. Be sure to make a
brief speech about how the food is just your way of saying thank you to
everyone for a week of great results.
 Take employees to lunch. If you have an employee or a few employees
who really went the distance for a customer, thank them by inviting
them to join you at a restaurant for lunch. The cost is kept down by
making the meal a lunch rather than a dinner. Be sure to allow yourself
enough time to recognize all the participants for their contributions
without being rushed.
122
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

 Surprise employees with balloons. For the biggest impact, deliver the bal-
loons to the employees’ desks while they are away from their work area.
The balloons will be a pleasant surprise when the employee returns. Be
sure to attach a personal thank-you note to the balloons recognizing each
person’s achievement.
 Send flowers. A simple bouquet of fresh-cut flowers always brightens a
person’s day. If they’re delivered, the cost will be a little bit higher, but
the recognition will be even more special.
 Buy a plant. Because cut flowers have a limited life, try recognizing a
staff person for something special by giving him or her a potted plant,
such as an orchid, which stays in bloom for several weeks.
 Give away tickets to a sporting event. We know many companies that
get discount tickets for their local sports teams. Have tickets available
for different sports and always give them in pairs so that the staff
member can take a friend or family member along.
 Let the employee come to work an hour late (with pay). This thank-you
always seems to work well. The time can be increased to fit the deed. We
recommend a maximum of two hours, because rewarding any more than
that may require extra planning to cover the person’s job. An alternative
to this idea is letting the employee leave work an hour early.
 Buy a magazine subscription. Most monthly magazines cost less than
$30 a year for a subscription. Select magazines that reflect employees’
interests or let them select their own. Magazines take a while to be deliv-
ered after an order is placed, so include this lag time into your timing.
You can present the award by giving the employees a card or letter
informing them about the magazine. Recipients will be reminded of their
achievements every month when they receive their magazines.
 Give a gift certificate. You can find gift certificates these days for just
about any product or service. Gift certificates to bookstores, record
stores, restaurants, and movie theaters are particularly popular.
Ideas that cost less than $100
You can come up with some nice ways to recognize an employee who pro-
vides excellent customer service when your spending limit increases. If you
can swing a budget of around $100, then you can treat your top performers 
to some top rewards including:
 Treating an employee to dinner for two. Select a good restaurant and
arrange for a gift certificate. Determine a dollar limit ahead of time that
covers dinner, dessert, and beverages for two.
 Giving the employee a day off. When one of your staff members does
something really special, consider giving her an extra day off with pay. In
most businesses, Friday is a good day to choose, because it often is the
123
Chapter 8: Beyond Employee of the Month: Reward and Recognition

least busy day of the week, so the interruption at work is minimized, and
the employee gets a three-day weekend.
 Sending the employee to an outside training program. Show your
appreciation for members of your staff by investing in their education.
Let them choose a training course that supports their personal or pro-
fessional interests and have the company pay. This course can be any-
thing from a cooking class to a time-management workshop.
Formal Rewards
Although they don’t have the same everyday impact as informal recognition,
formal awards nevertheless are an important part of your strategy for service
improvement. Annual or semi-annual award presentations need to be highly
publicized and must send a clear message about what values and behaviors
your company holds in high esteem. Managers and supervisors also benefit
from a formal reward program, because it lends credibility to the values and
behaviors that they’ve been informally recognizing.
Formal reward programs require time and planning, because your service
improvement strategy must include a simple and practical way to measure
who wins. Attention must be given to every department and group so that
those people who have little or no customer contact have as much chance of
winning as those with front-line service jobs.
Two essential aspects of leveraging the success of any rewards program are
 Fairness: Make sure programs are neither political nor relationship
biased. Everyone needs to have an equal chance at recognition.
 Consistency: Use the same or comparable criteria for selecting reward
candidates. If your staff members perceive inconsistencies with the pro-
gram, it will rapidly lose support.
Keeping the rewards interesting
Formal reward programs that stay the same year after year eventually stop
being special. Winners begin to think that their rewards are just routine, and
other employees lose interest in winning. You can keep your reward program
dynamic and alive by updating it from year to year, altering the ceremony, the
prizes, and the criteria for winning.
124
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Varying the rewards to suit the person
Taking the one-size-fits-all approach is a big mistake when dealing with formal
reward programs. Having a variety of awards available ensures that the
prizes you offer have meaning to the individuals who receive them. So if you
have a winner who hates sports but loves music, give him tickets to the sym-
phony — not the ball game. Prizes are most often given at a special event,
such as an all-company meeting, picnic, or, if appropriate, a company dinner.
Awards can range from personalized mementos to family vacations, depend-
ing on the size of your company, your budget, and the achievement. The sec-
tions that follow describe five awards that you may want to consider for a
formal reward program.
A fancy dinner
A special meal is a wonderful way to celebrate a winning team’s achievement.
The team becomes your guest at a fancy restaurant, and you play host to the
evening on the company. During the dinner, you can highlight your team’s
accomplishments and invite other team members to speak. If your group is
larger than six people, hearing each other in a crowded restaurant can
become difficult, so consider going to one that offers private dining facilities.
The dinner also needs to be highly publicized by memo, bulletin board, or
newsletter, so that other staff members are aware of the achievement.
Customized gifts
Customized gifts are available from catalogs or companies that specialize in
incentive and motivational products. Some items that are easily personalized
and readily available are
 Pen-and-pencil sets
 Notepads
 T-shirts
 Paperweights
 Award pins
Some incentive companies have Web-based programs that offer managers 
a way of designing, tracking, and administering all aspects of an employee
reward program. With different levels of sophistication available, managers
can create a custom designed, soup-to-nuts incentive program or a simple
reward catalog that is e-mailed to service winners to choose their own prizes
ranging from clocks to chainsaws.
Customized trophies
Plaques, silver cups, desk awards, and other trophies can be engraved with
the employee’s name, the date, and a brief description of the achievement.
125
Chapter 8: Beyond Employee of the Month: Reward and Recognition

Travel
Travel awards range from weekend getaways at a nearby bed-and-breakfast to
a week-long vacation trip to a resort. These awards always include travel and
lodging expenses for two and sometimes an allowance for meals and inciden-
tals. If the vacation is a week long, don’t forget to make arrangements for the
winner’s work to be handled during his or her absence; otherwise, vacation
memories will quickly sour on the first day back on the job.
Cash
Two schools of thought exist about giving cash awards to staff. Some compa-
nies don’t give monetary awards because they think that the money will be
used to pay bills and provide no lasting memory. Other companies think that
their employees appreciate extra money more than anything else, and cash
awards are the best motivators. One suggestion: Develop an award program
that incorporates both cash and prizes.
Making the award appropriate 
to the achievement
Be careful not to cheapen or lessen the value of an award by making it less
significant than the achievement calls for. For example, giving a personalized
pencil cup to the service hero whose initiative saved your largest account
probably isn’t the best idea.
The most successful and well-designed formal reward programs are simple to
administer. They give everyone in every position a chance to win, and have
simple, easy-to-understand rules and goals that everyone considers attainable.
Making it fun
We urge you to make your rewards and recognition programs fun! We’ve dis-
covered through the years that an environment of good humor helps everyone
learn more, work harder, and show added interest in whatever task is at hand.

Chapter 9
It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving
with a Twist
In This Chapter
 Benefiting from establishing quality groups
 Developing a complete five-step process
 Reaching a consensus; virtual problem-solving
A
large number of policies and procedures at many of the companies with
which we’ve worked were designed with the company’s convenience in
mind, rather than that of the customer. Reinventing these processes to make
them more customer-oriented is not unlike cleaning out your clothes closet.
As you remove each item and give it a closer look in the bright light of day,
you can’t believe the number of outdated things (wide ties, neon prom
dresses, platform shoes, and so on) you’ve kept.
Your company probably has a number of outdated processes, procedures,
and policies that are of limited value to you and an annoyance to your cus-
tomers. Many of these outfits have been hanging around your corporate
closet for so long they’ve just become “the way we do business” without
much careful consideration about their current usefulness or effectiveness. 
If you suspect that these types of outdated policies and procedures exist in
your company, but you haven’t tackled them yet, it may be because you’re
afraid of opening a Pandora’s box.
However, for your customer service to continually improve and flourish over
the long term, you must be willing not only to take a close and honest look at
the current customer focus of your policies and procedures but also to imple-
ment a structure for solving ongoing service problems and making your exist-
ing processes and procedures more customer focused. This structure must
address two issues:
 Getting your staff involved in the process of change.
 Providing a specific method for improving your processes, procedures,
and policies.

Problem-Solving with Quality Groups:
Killing Two Birds with One Stone
The best structure we know for addressing both of the preceding issues is
the implementation of quality groups, or process improvement teams, as
they’re sometimes called.
Just what exactly is a quality group?
Quality groups provide a step-by-step method for using your staff’s talents
and knowledge to solve ongoing quality and service problems. A quality
group is made up of a group of staff members who are temporarily brought
together either in meetings (usually once a week, for about an hour) or cyber-
space to solve a specific problem. The quality group is disbanded after the
problem is solved. The entire process usually takes anywhere from a couple
of weeks to a few months, depending on the scope and complexity of the
problem.
Traits of successful quality groups
Companies that have had the best results with quality groups or process
improvement teams understand the essential elements necessary to ensure
success. In the following sections, we discuss each of these elements.
128
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 
Repairing customer service in an auto repair shop
An auto repair shop decided it wanted to
improve its customer service. By using a simple,
written questionnaire, the staff of the auto
repair shop discovered that most customers
were very happy with the work the shop per-
formed, but they hated to wait in a small, grimy
office until someone in the back garage hap-
pened to come in and notice them. The repair
shop owner set up a small quality group to
address the problem. The members of the group
came up with a solution that involved painting
the office, installing a small coffee maker, and
wiring up a buzzer that sounded in the back
when the office door was opened. Each day a
different person was responsible for replenish-
ing the coffee, and a standard was set that
required the customer to be attended to within
one minute of the buzzer sounding. This simple
yet elegant example demonstrates how a small
company used the powerful resources of a
quality group to improve its service.

A user-friendly process
Quality groups originally were started within manufacturing companies to
decrease defects and improve the physical quality of their products. This
type of engineering-driven environment not surprisingly gave birth to a prob-
lem-solving process that was heavy on graphs, charts, and statistics.
Many of our clients, being service companies, were not passionate about
using Pareto charts or histograms (in fact, one staff member thought the
latter term was a surgical procedure), so we went searching for a much sim-
pler and user-friendly process that better fit the needs of a service business.
We became so disenchanted with how non-user-friendly these processes
were that we decided to create our own. What we outline for you in the next
few pages is a user-friendly twist on the typical quality group process. In our
opinion, a quality-group process is user-friendly when it has
 Short and simple steps for identifying, evaluating, and resolving service
problems.
 Language that is easily understood and not loaded down with tons of
jargon.
 Problem-solving techniques that are based on simple models rather than
complex matrices.
A strong quality-group facilitator
A quality group is made up of four to eight staff members who are guided
through the process by an in-house facilitator either face to face in live meet-
ings or in cyberspace via e-mail. The facilitator needs to be someone who has
strong communications skills and has been trained in the problem-solving
process your company has decided to use.
Most facilitators are staff members who have attended special training to find
out how to be a group facilitator. Because the duties of a facilitator usually
only take about an hour a week, they shouldn’t interfere with other job
responsibilities.
Training in-house staff to be facilitators gives them an opportunity for profes-
sional development and provides you with a group of employees who are
experts at solving problems. The facilitator makes the job of the group mem-
bers easier by
 Encouraging full participation.
 Guiding the team through problem-solving methods.
 Finding outside resources that can shed light on the problem.
129
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

 Educating group members about each step of the process.
 Providing a liaison between the quality group and management.
The facilitator doesn’t necessarily have to be familiar with the particular
problem on which the quality group is working. Sometimes a lack of hands-on
involvement can actually help the facilitator remain impartial and objective.
Support from management
When quality groups fail, it’s most often because they weren’t supported by
management. We’ve found the main questions that managers have about
quality groups are
 Will I lose control of my department or staff?
 Will my input on the problem be ignored?
 What if the quality group comes up with an innovative solution to a
problem that I’ve been trying to solve for years?
In most cases, these fears are unfounded, and for that reason, we recommend
that prior to the first quality group meeting, the facilitator meet with or e-mail
every manager whose staff will be participating in the quality group. Use the
meeting to quell management fears by explaining how a quality group works.
Topics to cover include
 An overview of the specific process to be used (see the section, “Using a
Step-By-Step Problem-Solving Method in Your Quality Group”).
 How the manager, although not a member of the group, can address the
team from time to time and offer his or her input.
 Ways the manager can support the quality group, including how the
manager plans for times when the department is short-staffed and he or
she cannot afford to let staff attend a scheduled quality group meeting.
The sooner managers are brought into the information loop, the better,
although some managers balk at the idea of involving staff in the process of
changing policies or procedures. As one unenlightened vice president put it:
“You mean you want me to turn over the asylum to the inmates?” Our experi-
ence has consistently been that when they’re given guidance and support,
staff members will come up with innovative ideas that benefit the customer
and the company.
Starting off with the right problem
In most cases, management determines which specific problem a particular
quality group is going to work on. We recommend that you begin with a small
problem that’s relatively easy to solve. An initial success creates momentum
and positive press that you can then use as a springboard for taking on
bigger, more complex problems. Try to choose initial problems that are
130
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

 Simple rather than complex.
 Local and specific rather than widespread and general.
 Free of heavy political implications.
 Beneficial to both customers and staff.
The right mix of staff
The staff members who participate in the quality group must have a hands-
on relationship with the problem they’re going to solve. Including group
members from different departments is a good idea, whenever appropriate.
Doing so ensures that the solution the group comes up with addresses how
the problem impacts different departments.
By setting up your quality group only after you’ve selected the problem, you
ensure that the members you select for any given team are the right people
for the right problem.
Using a Step-by-Step Problem-Solving
Method in Your Quality Group
Although very similar, the process you use with a quality group in meetings is
somewhat different than the process you use for virtual online quality groups.
For a real-time, face-to-face quality groups that meet each week, use the five-
step problem-solving process that we discuss in this section.
To make it easy for your company or department to follow this process, we’ve
created a guide that describes, in detail, what takes place every step of the
way. We’ve also included a special facilitator’s checklist at the end of each
step to provide your facilitator with some valuable tools.
Step 1: Introduce the basics
The first quality group meeting is critical because it introduces the members
to an overview of the six steps and gives them the opportunity to ask ques-
tions. In addition, the first meeting agenda needs to do the following.
Explain the nature of a quality group
Many companies live by this misguided rule: There’s never enough time to do it
right but always enough time to do it over. Being service-focused means taking the
time to prevent future problems — instead of merely reacting to current ones.
131
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

On more than one occasion the president of a company has said to us:
“Quality groups are a good idea, but we just can’t afford to take the time to
do this right now.” Our response: “How can you afford not to take the time?”
Everyone knows a problem exists, but the culture of deadline thinking doesn’t
give your staff or managers the opportunity, or time, to actually sit down and
come up with a thorough and well-thought-out solution that fixes the prob-
lem in the long term. Quality groups give your company a short period each
week when deadline thinking is put on the back burner and thorough thinking
takes the spotlight. Thorough thinking is different from the everyday work
mode, because it requires the group to approach problem-solving by
 Sorting out the facts of the situation from the assumptions.
 Looking at all the possible solutions — not just the obvious ones.
 Gaining widespread acceptability for the solution rather than imposing a
solution on others.
 Looking at long-term impact and short-term gains.
After members of your staff get a taste of this way of working, you’ll find that
they take the habits back to work with them and, even when under time pres-
sure, bring a new level of quality to their everyday decisions.
Establish ground rules
As a group, you must decide on and agree to adhere to specific ground rules —
or rules of conduct. On the quality group ground rules worksheet shown in
Figure 9-1, we provide you with what most groups consider the essential items
for running smooth quality groups. Before the first meeting, make copies of the
list for each member, and then after a group discussion, delete or add items
accordingly.
Confirm dates and locations
Because the meeting day and times aren’t always fixed and may be different
from week to week to suit the schedules of group members, make sure that
your meeting room is available for all the scheduled dates and double-check
to make sure that all members are confirmed for the correct dates and times.
Clarify individual responsibilities
Nothing is more annoying than a meeting that’s slowed because one or more
group members didn’t do what they were supposed to do. This problem frus-
trates other members of the group and hurts the credibility of the persons
who didn’t deliver. Each group member is responsible for showing up on time
and bringing the results of any assignment he or she agreed to take on.

Facilitator’s checklist
If you’re a facilitator of a quality group, this section is especially for you. It
contains tips, techniques, and ideas about how to make your quality group
meetings a roaring success. Your level of enthusiasm and excitement at the
first meeting is especially critical because it sets the stage for a great quality
group and creates rapport between the team members.

Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

As facilitator at the first quality group meeting, try to accomplish the 
following:
❑Make everyone feel welcome.
After everyone is seated, have each person introduce himself or herself.
If everyone already knows one another, you can ask each of them to
explain why he or she is in the quality group and what he or she expects
to gain personally by participating.
❑Write the problem on the flip chart.
Ask whether anyone in the group has any questions about the problem —
what it means, is it stated clearly, and so on.
❑Talk about the importance of teamwork in the quality group.
Explain that good teamwork in the quality group is achieved by combin-
ing effective interpersonal skills (listening, supporting each other, and
offering constructive ideas) with creative problem-solving (brainstorm-
ing, looking for realistic solutions, and not making assumptions).
❑Answer any questions that group members have.
Some common questions may include: Are the meetings approved by
upper management? Will the group be meeting in the same place each
week? Will you always be this group’s facilitator?
If you don’t know the answer to a question, don’t make something up.
Nobody expects you to have all the answers, and you’ll develop trust by
telling it the way it is. Please don’t try to snow the group with your infi-
nite wisdom.
❑Be sure that the next meeting is set up and ready to go.
Because each group member’s attendance is key to the success of the
quality group, verify that everyone knows the date, time, and location of
the next meeting and that all members are able to attend. In addition,
make sure that you have a room reserved for the next meeting and all
necessary supplies, including:
• A flip chart with markers and masking tape or thumb tacks
• Any blank forms that are needed
• A blank minutes sheet for the note taker
❑Use the action plan worksheet.
Any agreed-upon actions need to be written down on an action plan work-
sheet like the one shown in Figure 9-2 and brought to the next meeting.
❑Arrange the note taker for the next meeting.
134
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Before the end of the first meeting, decide who will serve as note taker
for the next session. Be sure to have that person make a copy of the min-
utes worksheet (see Figure 9-3) and bring it to the next session. Because
the note taker is focusing on recording what is said, he or she probably
won’t participate as much in the discussion as other members. For that
reason, every member of the group eventually needs to take a turn as
note taker.

Step 2: Find the cause of the problem
Unlike the first step, finding the actual cause of the problem usually takes
more than one meeting because it involves listing and then evaluating all the
possible causes.
Listing all possible causes of the problem
Determining a problem’s causes is a brainstorming activity (flip back to
Chapter 6 for tips and rules about brainstorming). As the group brainstorms,
each member indicates what he or she thinks are the possible causes of the
problem. The facilitator lists the causes on a flip chart. After each group

member has spoken and all possible causes are listed, the group is ready to
discuss and evaluate them.
Evaluating the various causes
Now that all the various causes are laid out on the flip charts, the group can
discuss and evaluate them. First, the group needs to eliminate the causes
they see as having only a minor impact on the problem. After this task is
complete, the group must come to a consensus decision (see the sidebar
titled “Consensus decision-making”) on the causes of the problem they think
are most significant.
At this point, further investigation and fact gathering about the supposed
causes often is necessary; however, because this investigation usually occurs
between meetings, you probably will have several different actions that need
to be carried out by several different group members. Use the action plan
worksheet in Figure 9-2 to keep track of who will do what and by when.
137
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist
Consensus decision-making
In the normal course of work, groups use 
many different methods for making decisions,
including:
 Voting
 Assigning a leader who makes the ultimate
decision
 Doing nothing and letting circumstances
decide
 Letting the customer make the decision
In a quality group, however, many discussions
are aimed at helping the team reach a consen-
sus decision, or one that’s supported by all 
the members of the team. Reaching a consen-
sus decision doesn’t mean that all group mem-
bers are head-over-heels in love with the
decision, just that they will be able to genuinely
support it.
For example, a group member who has partici-
pated actively in the discussion may at some
point say, “This option would not be my first
choice, and it wasn’t what I originally thought
we would do, but I can live with the decision.”
Chances are this team member thinks that his
or her point of view has been heard and appre-
ciated and thus will continue to participate
wholeheartedly in future meetings.
On the other hand, consensus decision-making
is not forcing group members to acquiesce by
ignoring their opinions or intimidating them. For
example, if a group member thinks that his con-
cerns have not been addressed, he may say in
frustration, “Okay, go ahead, if that’s what
you’ve decided to do. I won’t get in your way.”
The tone of his voice and his body language
obviously show you that he doesn’t really sup-
port the decision and is just going along
because he feels too frustrated to do anything
else. When that happens, this group member
probably will participate less in discussions 
and then bring up unresolved issues in later
meetings — much to the chagrin of other 
members — and may be the first to undermine
the decision when problems with implementa-
tion crop up along the way. Without a true con-
sensus in decision-making, the quality group
will have a hard time moving on to the next
steps.

When team members are familiar with a problem or the problem has been
around for a long time, you need to avoid the common tendency toward
quickly developing a solution without stopping to understand why the prob-
lem exists. This often misdirected inclination is why looking beyond the
symptoms of the problem to the root causes is so important.
Facilitator’s checklist
Because your group will be using brainstorming and consensus decision-
making techniques for the first time during this step, make sure that you
manage the process so that everyone feels that he or she is making a positive
contribution to the group. Some tips that can help you make this step smooth
as silk include
❑Writing all brainstorming ideas on a flip chart.
After you’ve filled up a page, tear it off and stick it to the wall with mask-
ing tape or thumb tacks so that everyone in the room can see it. Having
all the ideas clearly visible to all members of the group stimulates 
creativity.
❑Asking members of your group the following questions to help them
cover all the bases:
• What percentage of the problem is eliminated if this cause is fixed?
• Is this cause of the problem constant or intermittent?
• Are we overlooking another cause that leads to this cause?
• Are we making any assumptions about this cause?
• Do we need any extra information about this cause?
❑Concluding meetings at ideal stopping points.
Avoid taking up the entire time slot just because you have scheduled a
certain amount of time. If you find that you’re 15 minutes away from the
meeting’s allotted time and you think the next discussion will require
more than 15 minutes to complete, feel free to stop. You can begin the
next session with the tabled or postponed topic.
Step 3: Brainstorm solutions 
to the problem
Now that your team members have identified the major causes of the problem,
they’re ready to brainstorm possible solutions. Because you’ve already done
the groundwork and identified the real causes of the problem, the group is
better equipped to come up with more targeted solutions during this session.
138
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

At this point, your team is in the middle of the quality group process. The
potential danger here is that team members may become embroiled in their
differing points of view about the right way to solve the problem. Some of the
actions you can take as a facilitator to make sure this step is as productive as
possible are:
 Being aware of any change in a group member’s behavior.
Pay attention to any normally active member who suddenly begins
behaving in an uncharacteristically quiet manner. This behavior may
mean that the member thinks the group isn’t paying attention to his or
her ideas and opinions.
 Remaining sensitive to the fact that some group members may be
overwhelmed.
In this part of the process, you’re dealing with large amounts of informa-
tion and some members may begin to feel buried by details and may
want to either throw in the towel or simply go along with the team mem-
bers who are the most persistent and forceful. Show your sensitivity to
this situation by explaining that feeling overwhelmed isn’t uncommon
and that the group soon will be out of the woods.
Part of your job as facilitator is to ensure that everyone participates regard-
less of their differences or inhibitions. You can use several of the following
techniques to accomplish that goal:
❑Ask group questions.
These questions enable everyone to participate, and they’re a good way
to begin a brainstorming session. In general, open-ended questions
(questions that begin with what, where, when, and why) work best for
brainstorming. For example, you may ask the whole group, “What do
you think are some of the main solutions to this problem?”
❑Ask an individual a question.
These questions help involve group members who aren’t yet participat-
ing because they may be quieter or a little bit shy. For example, you may
say “Jose, how do you feel about this option?”
❑Gather specific information.
Whenever group members present information that’s too general, you
can use closed-ended questions (questions that begin with did, does, do,
and can) to get more specific information from them. For example, “Can
you be more specific?” or “Do you have an example?”
❑Acknowledge what group members say.
When group members speak, you need to let them know that you under-
stand and are interested in what they’re saying and that their comments
are important. For example, nod your head, lean forward, and say, “I
see,” “Okay,” “Yes,” or “Uh-huh” to encourage the person to continue.
139
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

❑Practice active listening.
This technique is also called paraphrasing. You repeat back the main
points of what a group member has said to you. For example, if a team
member thinks the only solution to the problem is buying a new com-
puter system, you’d say back to him, “Let me see if I understand. You
don’t think updating the old computer system will fix the problem. You
think we need to invest in a new one. Is that correct?” This technique
clarifies what the person has said, lets him know that you have heard
and understood him, and provides him with an opportunity to make 
corrections as needed.
❑Remain silent.
Often, you won’t want to speak or initiate conversation. Your not speak-
ing enables the team to think about the topic on the table. This time to
think is especially important when you start a brainstorming session
because people usually need a minute or two to gather their thoughts.
❑Sustain participation.
If you encounter a lull in the conversation, asking the question, “What
else?” helps stimulate the group to take a deeper look at the issue before
them. It keeps the discussion going when you know that there is more to
be said.
❑Conclude.
When the group has nothing more to say and you think that all the feed-
back has been given, wrap up the discussion by using the phrase,
“Anything else?” Doing so lets group members know that this is the last
call for feedback on this part of the discussion.
Step 4: Evaluate possible solutions
Some of the solutions the team comes up with will be better than others and
must be evaluated for how feasible it is to implement them. This step helps
you eliminate solutions that look good on paper but won’t work in reality.
The solution evaluation worksheet in Figure 9-4 can help the group evaluate
each possible solution against important criteria. Review the form and add
anything that your group feels is critical.
Finding the most viable solution
As each box of the form is filled in, the group needs to stop and discuss any
pertinent issues. If the group determines that more information is needed, be
sure to allow enough time between meetings to gather the information. When
each solution has been fully evaluated, total the ratings and the solution with
the highest score is the winner — and usually the all-around best solution.
140
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Facilitator’s checklist
At last your group is ready to talk about solutions, but to avoid getting
slowed down by personality conflicts and different points of view, keep the
group moving toward consensus decision-making by using these strategies:
❑Respect differences of opinion in the group.
You can count on different degrees of agreement and enthusiasm from
the group members as you go through this step. For example, members
who are detail-oriented may want to dwell on certain issues until they’re
completely satisfied that every facet has been examined. Others who

see a bigger picture won’t want to dwell on the small specifics that they
find “boring and insignificant.” These two different perspectives can
create a synergy where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Your job as facilitator is to respect each person’s point of view, ask ques-
tions that reveal assumptions, and help your group move forward.
❑Recognize each team member’s unique contribution.
Each person in your quality group brings unique strengths and talents to
the table. Some members may have a natural inclination toward working
with numbers, others are better at interviewing, and still others may
excel at creating charts, graphs, and diagrams. The success of your team
depends largely upon each member appreciating what the others bring
to the party.
Step 5: Recommend a solution 
to management
Effectively presenting the findings and recommendations of the quality group
is, in some ways, the moment of truth. It’s when all the hard work that’s been
done during previous weeks comes to fruition.
The more organized and prepared the quality group is, the more confident its
members will be when the presentation rolls around. Prepare for the meeting
by following the directions in the sections that follow.
Deciding who will make the presentation
Before members of the quality group begin planning the structure of the pre-
sentation, they need to decide who will make the presentation. You may want
to consider:
 Having different quality group members present different parts of the
presentation, depending on their expertise or the depth of their involve-
ment in a particular area.
 Having two members of the group give a brief talk on the benefits that
they personally received from being involved in the quality group.
 Having all the team members attend the presentation. To miss it would
be like missing the grand finale.
 Directly involving all team members with some aspect of preparing the
presentation even if they cannot attend.
Determining what materials and equipment are needed
Do team members have all the graphs, charts, overheads, handouts, and so on
that they need to make the presentation? Is any special audiovisual equipment
142
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

needed, such as an overhead projector, VCR, computer, television, and so on?
Make sure that you have all of the research, evidence, and analysis needed to
back up the team’s proposals.
Preparing the structure of the presentation
The presentation shouldn’t take any longer than an hour. The group needs to
prepare the presentation (including who will present what) using the follow-
ing information:
 An introduction of the members of the quality group and the problem
they worked on.
 A discussion of how long the quality group took to resolve the problem.
 A description of the key causes that led to the problem.
 The general direction taken and methods used for arriving at the solution.
 An explanation of the proposed solution and its expected impact.
 A note thanking the people who contributed information and assistance
but were not on the team
Reaching Online Consensus 
in Virtual Quality Groups
Today, it’s something of a luxury for a quality group to be able to sit in the
same room together. Sit-down meetings are rare not only because of time
constraints, but also because companies have virtual teams — groups of
people who are dedicated to the same project but who live and work in differ-
ent geographical locations. The technological revolution has made physical
location less important than ever before. So how do you problem-solve using
the synergy, or collective power, of a group, when members of the group are
scattered across the country or around the world? E-mail, of course.
E-mail is an effective tool for online quality groups, because it provides a
forum for brainstorming, gathering input from others, and agreeing on the
best course of action. The online problem-solving process presented in this
section provides an alternative to traditional face-to-face quality groups and
produces innovative and cost-effective solutions that motivate everyone
involved.
Similar to the traditional five-step process for quality groups outlined in the
section on “Using a Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Method in Your Quality
Group” earlier in this chapter, the following process features a few special
twists and turns to make it work online.
143
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

Step 1: State the problem and request
feedback on possible causes
After team members have been selected (a group of four to twelve people
works well), the facilitator begins the process by sending an e-mail to all team
members. This message contains
 A description of the problem to be solved
 A request for the team’s input
The facilitator needs to state the problem as simply and clearly as possible
and must be careful not to state the problem as a solution, because doing so
preempts the team from coming up with a different — and probably better —
solution. For example, “Should we cancel the interoffice Fruitcake Bake-off?”
is better stated as, “We don’t have enough volunteers for the interoffice
Fruitcake Bake-off.”
If needed, the facilitator can include a small amount of background informa-
tion in the e-mail message. Any background information must be kept brief,
because most team members already should be familiar with the problem.
Next, the facilitator asks team members to write down what they believe are
the possible causes of the problem and explains that they should feel free to
write down whatever comes to mind in this brainstorming exercise without
too much editing — that will take place later.
The e-mail may look something like the following:
Dear Team:
I would like to get your input regarding a problem that we
have every year about this time. We do not have enough
volunteers for the interoffice Fruitcake Bake-off.
Before we deal with the solutions to this problem, I would
like to know what each of you believes is the cause of
this problem. Right now, I am interested in getting all
your ideas. Please write down anything that comes to mind
and e-mail me back before noon on Friday.
I will publish all the results that I receive on the fol-
lowing Monday. Thank you.
Regards, Steve
144
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Step 2: Publish possible causes and
request cause evaluations
Having received all the e-mails from the group, the facilitator cuts and pastes
all the feedback into a new e-mail that is sent to all team members. Each person
on the team sees all the ideas submitted by the other people on the team.
This step is the online version of writing ideas on a flip chart at the front of 
a meeting room. The facilitator needs to remain impartial throughout this
process and never edit or paraphrase other people’s ideas, because doing so
can change the intended meaning. If your organization conducts plenty of
online discussions, consider investing in discussion group software.
The second part of the e-mail asks team members to consider all of the possi-
ble causes that were contributed and select the one that is the root cause of
the problem.
Some root causes are difficult for an organization to change, so try to avoid
having the participants agree on a general root cause, such as:
 Company culture
 Upper management
 Communication
Obviously, anything goes in online brainstorming, but as the evaluation
process begins, facilitators must ensure that any of the general root causes
listed above are defined in a more specific manner. The following e-mail
shows you how:
Dear Team:
Thank you for your timely responses to the Fruitcake prob-
lem. Here are the causes that you came up with. Please
read through them and pick the one that you believe is the
root cause.
People hate anything to do with fruitcake
The 60 Minutes piece on baked goods that can kill has
people worried
People are too busy to spend time volunteering
The word volunteer reminds people of being in the army
145
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

Bad timing — the world shortage of glazed fruit makes the
contest politically incorrect
The event has negative PR — last year the winner got into
a fight with the runner-up
People don’t want to give up their lunch hours
I need to receive your vote for the root cause by end of
business on Tuesday. Thanks.
Regards, Steve
Step 3: Publish root cause and request
feedback on possible solutions
After all the evaluations are received, the facilitator counts the number of
votes for each possible cause. After tallying all the numbers, the facilitator
publishes the cause with the most votes, which thereafter is considered the
real cause of the problem.
Make it clear to all team members that they can add potential causes and
new information at any point during the process. Often, as more information
is transmitted to each member, new ideas emerge that may be more innova-
tive and effective than the original input.
Now that the real cause has been agreed upon — by group consensus — the
next job is to brainstorm possible solutions. To request feedback on possible
solutions, send an e-mail like the one that follows:
Dear Team:
Here is the most agreed upon root cause to the fruitcake
volunteer situation:
People hate anything to do with fruitcake
Now we need to come up with some creative, cost-effective
ways of solving this problem. Once again, I need your input.
Please send me an e-mail listing all your ideas for solving
this problem. I need your responses by Friday at noon.
Thanks, Steve
146
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 

Step 4: Publish possible solutions 
and request solution evaluations
Having received all the responses back from the team, the facilitator cuts and
pastes the feedback into one e-mail that’s sent to all team members.
Be sure the e-mail asks each person in the group to evaluate all the suggested
solutions and choose the one that he or she thinks will be the most effective.
The criteria for a workable solution will vary with your specific circum-
stances, but usually these areas are important to consider:
 Financial cost
 Resource cost
 Work interruption
 Management support
 Implementation time
The message needs to look something like the following:
Dear Team:
Here are the solutions the group came up with. They are
very creative and I believe we are close to a fruitcake
breakthrough!
Use French to disguise the negative fruitcake connotations —
something like “Festival de Gateau Fruit”
Publish a list of famous sports personalities who like
fruitcake
Change the event to the Fruitcake Hurling Contest
Educate our staff about fruitcakes by setting up a
Fruitcake U or an intranet Web page with fruitcake FAQs
Make it a brownie cook-off
Please study this exciting list and vote for the solution
that you believe will best solve this annual problem.
Please have your responses back to me by Wednesday at
noon. Thank you.
Regards, Steve
147
Chapter 9: It Takes a Team: Problem-Solving with a Twist

Step 5: Publish consensus solution
The facilitator tallies all the votes and publishes the most popular solution.
Dear Team:
Here is the solution that the group unanimously agreed on:
Change the event to the Fruitcake Hurling Contest
There’s already an excited buzz about the office. In fact,
several people have already volunteered to bake the fruit-
cakes.
Thank you all for doing an outstanding job. I will contact
you next week to get your ideas about the best cake size
and weight for hurling.
Regards, Steve
This process not only helps strengthen teamwork, but it also lets people
know that their input is valuable. By using the synergy of a group, you’re sure
to end up with higher quality solutions than those generated by one person.
148
Part II: Take It from the Top: Service Management 
Overcoming roadblocks
Sometimes teams get bogged down in the
details and come to a roadblock in the decision-
making process. When that happens, the facil-
itator may need to coach the group through the
stalemate. Coaching via e-mail often takes the
form of asking pertinent questions that create
dialogue and mutual understanding to get the
team back on track. Here is a list of questions
that will get you started:
 What are the key issues that are holding up
the process?
 What have you done to try and break the
deadlock?
 What happened?
 What would be a satisfying outcome?
 What team values are needed to guide the
final outcome?
 What decision best reflects these values?
 Can the group live with this decision?
 What are the next steps in moving on with
this decision?

H
ave you ever called a company and been rudely put
on hold before you even gave your name? Have you
ever waited at the counter in a department store while the
sales clerk chatted with a co-worker? Have you ever been
informed in a not-so-friendly tone by the waiter or wait-
ress that “Substituting tomatoes for potatoes is against
our policy”?
If you’re like most people, you’ve encountered these situa-
tions, and you probably find yourself thinking about how
little this person would have to do to turn the situation
from a service failure into a service success. In every one
of the above situations, some small aspect of the body lan-
guage, tone of voice, or words used put the customer off.
In this part of the book, we explore those little things,
those simple actions that lead to significant payoffs in
customer satisfaction and sales. We provide you with
time-tested techniques for dealing with people face-to-face
and over the telephone, and we cover a variety of impor-
tant communication skills that you can easily use every
day at work and at home.

Body Language

ody language is a constant, nonverbal flow of communication. Without
saying a word (and sometimes without realizing it), your body language
can reveal what you’re feeling and thinking. For example, you can guess 
how the service person feels about you — the customer — in the following
situations:
 The bank teller whose eyes roll in exasperation when you bring in the
loose change you’ve collected during the past five years
 The doctor who ignores you and stares at your chart while you explain
your symptoms
 The painful expression on the full-service gas station attendant’s face
when you ask him to put air in your tires (he thought “full service” was
Latin for “pay extra for gas”)
A few years ago, a major university conducted a study on how people receive
messages from other people (see Figure 10-1). It showed that 55 percent of
what you learn from others comes from their body language, 33 percent
comes from tone of voice, and a mere 7 percent comes from the actual words
they speak.
Actions obviously do speak louder than words, and body language conveys
what you’re truly thinking and feeling, regardless of what you say. Your ability
to read your customers’ body language and project your own in a way that
says, “I’m here to help,” are among the least expensive but most powerful
skills you have.

The primary aspects of body language are eye contact, facial expressions,
body posture and movement, hand gestures, touching, and physical distance.
If any of these aspects of body language are overdone or underdone, they can
misfire and create a negative impression. Although interpreting body lan-
guage isn’t an exact science, some general rules apply, and that’s exactly
what we discuss in this chapter.
Seeing Customers Eye to Eye
Eye contact is one of the most powerful of all the body-language skills. It’s
called an attending skill, because it tells customers that you’re interested,
receptive, and attentive to what they’re saying. Eye contact enables you to
listen to customers’ feelings in addition to their words.
Effective eye contact is achieved by softly focusing on a customer’s face. By
that we mean the moment a customer walks up to you, regardless of what
you are doing, make immediate eye contact by focusing on the customer’s
entire face, not just the eyes. As the conversation moves on, look away from
time to time to avoid giving the impression that you’re staring.
Overdone: Students of the Zombie School of Body Language are easy to 
spot — they stare the customer down with a hard gaze and never take their
eyes off him. This I’ve-got-you-in-my-sights approach gives customers the
willies and makes them want to leave before they can zero in on your prod-
ucts for the kill.

Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Underdone: You walk up to a bank teller and instead of looking up at you,
she continues to look down at her paperwork. This lack of eye contact, com-
bined with a clear view of the top of the teller’s head, is a negative moment of
truth and can be interpreted as lack of interest in helping you. Likewise, when
you’re talking to someone and he constantly looks around the room and not
at you, you get the impression that he has something more important that
he’d rather be doing.
Research shows that people stop making eye contact and look away the
moment they sense that the other person is showing emotion on his or her
face. This natural desire not to be intrusive or embarrass the other person is
misplaced when you’re dealing with an upset customer. By not looking away
from the irate customer, you project a positive impression that shows you
really care. So be sure to maintain eye contact and thus give your customers
the impression that you want to hear what they’re saying. An added benefit:
Maintaining eye contact usually makes the customer feel less upset.
In many Asian countries (Japan, Korea, and Thailand, in particular), making
strong and continuous eye contact with another person during a conversa-
tion is considered rude. In fact, in these cultures, children are taught from a
young age to avert their eyes and avoid direct eye contact.
Minding Your Facial Expressions
Your facial expression is like a billboard that tells everyone around you
whether you’re happy, sad, excited, and so on. Be careful how you allow
stress to affect that billboard’s appearance. Don’t allow the stresses of the
day to gather on your brow so that you resemble a scrunched up prune.
Customers don’t care whether you’ve had the day from hell; as far as they’re
concerned, their encounter with you is your first of the day. Simply make
sure that your facial expression sets a positive tone before you ever begin to
speak. A relaxed or pleasant facial expression most of the time is the ideal;
however, when concern or upset enter the picture, you need to adjust your
facial expression to suit the customer’s state of mind.
Overdone: A client in England told us about a bank that decided to improve
its customer service by slapping happy-face stickers (the big, ugly, yellow
ones) up behind each teller’s counter with the message “Remember to smile
at the customer” written underneath. Although not a terrible idea, we thought
that this procedure might lead to problems: Imagine how annoyed you’d be if
your bank teller informed you that you were $5,000 overdrawn — and he had
a big fat grin on his face! Even a positive facial expression, such as smiling, can
be overdone.
153
Chapter 10: A Wink, a Smile, and a Nod: Body Language

Underdone: The daydreaming stare, faraway gaze, and blank look are classic
expressions that can creep over your face without your realizing it. When
caught with one of those looks on your face, the customer certainly doesn’t
want to be the one to wake you from your coma.
Using a relaxed and pleasant facial expression with your staff is as important
as using that same look with your customers. Using effective facial expres-
sions encourages your staff to seek you out for coaching, guidance, and infor-
mation. The same is true of your customers. Becoming more aware of your
facial expressions is easy; we recommend examining how you look in family
snapshots or videos, especially the ones that were taken before you had a
chance to say “Cheese!”
From the Waist Up
Body posture — and body movement in particular — shows your energy level
and reflects your interest in what the customer is saying. You can tell when
people are listening impatiently or want to end the conversation by simple
body-language clues you can pick up from the way they move, such as:
 Leaning back or stepping away
 Turning their bodies away from you
 Pushing away from their desks or tables
 Gathering up papers
 Closing their briefcases while you’re still talking
 Looking at their watches repeatedly
To show that you are intently listening to and interested in a conversation
with your customer, try nodding, facing the customer, or leaning forward.
154

What’s with the wrinkled nose?
We once had a client who worked for a man-
ager who consistently wrinkled his nose when-
ever our client approached him with a question.
To her, his expression conveyed a message 
of, “Oh, no, not you again with another stupid
question!” To this day, our client wonders what
her manager was really thinking every time she
came into the room. Regardless, his facial
expression prevented her from asking him for
the information she needed.

Nodding
Nodding is one of the best nonverbal ways to show that you’re paying atten-
tion to what someone is saying. Nodding is particularly useful when you don’t
want to interrupt a customer who is explaining the details of a situation but
you still want her to know that you’re following along with what she’s saying.
In many parts of the world, a nod up and down means “Yes.” However, if you
find yourself in Turkey, Iran, or Bulgaria, be forewarned: When you nod your
head up and down in those countries, you’re saying “No,” and when you
shake your head back and forth, you’re saying “Yes.” If you understand what
we’re saying, say yes with your head, Bulgarian style.
Overdone: Although occasional nodding shows that you’re listening, contin-
ual nodding communicates impatience. We’re talking about the distracting
nod-nod-nod that people do when they want to hurry the conversation along.
This action translates to the customer as, “Hurry up and finish so that I can
say what I want to!”
Nodding during a lull in conversation is a clue that you don’t have any con-
nection with what’s going on around you.
Underdone: The next time you watch a sci-fi movie, pay close attention to
the way aliens are characterized by their body language. Their lack of human
qualities is emphasized by their staring straight ahead with arms pinned to
their sides and heads locked forward in one position (not to mention their
green skin and the one eye sticking out of the middle of their foreheads).
Don’t let this phenomenon happen to you. Make a conscious effort to show,
with your body language, that you are from this planet.
Facing the customer
By turning your whole body (not just your head) toward the customer, 
you convey the message that she has your full and undivided attention.
Facing away from the customer can make her feel that something else is 
distracting you.
Leaning forward
Although you don’t want to end up in the customer’s lap, you do want to lean
forward slightly to let the customer know that you’re interested in what is
being said. When a customer is expressing strong emotions or feelings, leaning
forward says, “I really want to hear and understand what you’re saying to me.”

Chapter 10: A Wink, a Smile, and a Nod: Body Language

Getting a Handle on Hand Gestures
Using your hands when you talk (even on the phone) is a natural way to
express your feelings. When some people talk with their hands, they appear
to be conducting an orchestra whenever they speak. Two varieties of hand
signals that you need to be aware of are hand-and-object gestures and hands-
alone gestures.
The first variety features hand gestures that rely on certain props and can
give you clear signals about your customer’s state of mind. These gestures
can include:
 Placing the cap on a pen and putting it in a pocket: This action signi-
fies a readiness to conclude the meeting or conversation.
 Tapping fingers on the tabletop: This gesture signifies impatience or
frustration.
 Repeatedly clicking a ball point pen: This action can mean the cus-
tomer is either uneasy or deep in thought. Look for other body-language
signals to cue you in to which is applicable.
 Rattling loose change in a pocket: This motion usually means, “I’m anx-
ious and ready to move on.”
The second variety of hand gestures doesn’t require any props. These ges-
tures can include:
 Open-hand gestures (flat hand, palm up, or palm out): When used to
give directions, they convey an invitation to move or look in a certain
direction. Open-hand gestures are a more gracious and softer way to
point at a person or object.
 Closed-hand gestures (pointing with index finger straight out): This
hand movement can be construed as a command, rather than an invita-
tion, when used to convey a direction. Closed-hand gestures usually are
considered rude and intimidating when directed at another person.
Although pointing may be discourteous, pointing a finger in someone’s
face at close range is even worse. This action definitely communicates
hostility or anger to the customer.
 Driving gestures: You see these gestures in your rear-view mirror when
you’re stuck in traffic on Friday night. They usually communicate very
clearly and need no further explanation.
156
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

The key, whether you use your hands a little or a lot, is to be natural in your
movements. Hand gestures should never detract from the conversation.
Overdone: To see overdone hand gestures at their best, watch the TV com-
mercials for car dealerships during the late, late movies. Focusing on what
the dealers are saying is often difficult because their hands are flying around
in big, unnatural, exaggerated, and distracting movements.
Underdone: A noticeable lack of hand gestures can be just as distracting as
waving them around like an octopus. Some people are so self-conscious
about what they should do with their hands that they clasp them behind
their backs, in front of their bodies, or pin them to their sides. This lack of
motion can give a customer the impression that the service person feels
threatened by — or uncomfortable with — what is being said.
Wherever the hands go, the arms are likely to follow. Some cultures, such 
as the Italians, naturally tend to use big, sweeping hand and arm motions;
others like the Japanese prefer to keep their arm and hand gestures small
and infrequent. In fact, moving your hands or arms in big gestures is consid-
ered impolite in Japan.
A Touchy Subject
The most acceptable form of touching in the American work environment is
the handshake. In some professions, such as healthcare, touch can take on a
more important role. Nurses and doctors, for example, use touch partly out
of necessity but also to convey a caring and concerned attitude. Regardless
of your profession, the least threatening place to touch someone (with whom
you don’t have a personal relationship) is on the arm between the elbow and
the wrist.
You always need to be sensitive to the other person’s reactions when touching
is involved. If you touch someone in a nonthreatening manner on the hand,
wrist, or elbow, and he moves his arm away, he’s telling you something. Let
this reaction be your clue not to touch him again.
Overdone: We don’t recommend the grip of death handshake used by some
people. This type of handshake is overly aggressive and can actually hurt the
recipient, giving that person the impression that he or she somehow is being
used to help you strengthen your tennis grip.
157
Chapter 10: A Wink, a Smile, and a Nod: Body Language

Touching can also be overdone by crossing over the nonthreatening bound-
aries of people with whom you don’t have a close relationship. Some common,
easily made mistakes include:
 Putting an arm around the customer’s shoulder (unless he is about to
faint)
 Slapping the customer on the back (unless she is choking)
 Mussing up the customer’s hair (unless you’re a hairdresser)
 Hugging someone and refusing to let go (unless you’re married to that
person)

Touching overseas: What to know before you go
As part of his research for Nonverbal
Communication for Business Success (Ameri-
can Management Association), author Ken
Cooper sat in outdoor cafes around the world,
observing conversations and counting the
number of times the patrons casually touched
each other. The results are as follows:
 San Juan, Puerto Rico, came in at first with
180 touches per hour.
 Paris, France, had 110 touches per hour.
 Florida had 2 touches per hour.
 London, England, had 0 touches per hour.
Obviously the way we touch, how often we
touch, and who we touch vary from one country
to the next almost as much as the languages
that are spoken in those places.
If you’re planning a business trip or vacation to
a country you’ve never visited before, you may
want to do some research first. Several excel-
lent books are available that can help you
understand cultural differences and customers
throughout the world. For more information
about body language and other important things
to know about a country, try the following
resources:
 Culture Shock Series (Times Books
International): This series of books is won-
derful. Each book focuses on a specific
country within Asia (Culture Shock!
Malaysia, for instance) and is full of detailed
information, covering most business and
social situations. The books differ from most
other travel books, because they not only
tell you rules of behavior, they also explain
the thinking and mind-set behind them. We
find them extremely useful, especially for
doing business in Southeast Asia.
 Gestures, by Roger E. Aztell (John Wiley &
Sons, Inc.): This book provides a broad look
at how body language is used around the
world. One thing we like about this book is
its coverage of more than 86 different coun-
tries. The tips are well-written, clear, and to
the point. Note that this book focuses its
attention on the specific do’s and don’ts of
body language and doesn’t go into great
detail regarding the psychology of the 
culture.

Underdone: You go to work for a new company, and you’re being shown
around the office. Your manager introduces you to a co-worker. You extend
your hand with certain confidence, prepared to provide her with a nice, firm
grip. In return you are offered a weak, dead fish (uggg!) type of handshake.
You shudder all over. Offering your hand in a tentative way is almost guaran-
teed to create a bad first impression.
Excuse Me, You’re Standing in My Space
Personal space is the distance that feels comfortable between you and another
person. If someone else approaches you and invades your personal space, you
automatically move back without a thought.
Whenever you see customers moving away from you, they may be doing so in
attempts to create more space. If that’s the case, step back and keep your dis-
tance. By maintaining a safe personal zone, you facilitate communication,
comfort, and trust. Three distinct spatial zones exist:
 Zone 1/Intimate (0–2 feet): This zone is reserved for romantic partners,
family members, close friends, and children. Entering this zone when
you don’t belong there is embarrassing and can be threatening to the
other person. That’s why standing close to people in a crowded elevator
is so uncomfortable. The small space forces you to be closer to other
people than you’d like. Most people deal with this feeling by staring up
at the floor numbers as though they hold the meaning of life.
 Zone 2/Personal (2–4 feet): Most of your conversations with customers
take place within this range. The personal space creates the privacy nec-
essary for a confidential discussion while a safe and comfortable distance
is maintained between you and the customer.
 Zone 3/Social (4 feet or more): This onstage range is mainly used by
teachers in the classroom, the boss at a company meeting, or the instruc-
tor in a training class. However, in the same way you can get too close for
comfort in the intimate zone, it’s also possible to be too far away from
someone for comfort in the social zone.
Overdone: The personal zone is most commonly overdone when you’re wait-
ing in line at customs at the airport, the pharmacy, the checkout stand at the
grocery store, and other such places.
Because people usually are impatient in these places, they tend to stand
closer to you, hoping that doing so moves them to the front of the line faster.
159
Chapter 10: A Wink, a Smile, and a Nod: Body Language

Underdone: Coauthor Karen Leland once had a meeting with a prospective
client. She was shown to his office and asked to take a seat. In the room was a
giant desk with a large chair behind it and two very small chairs about six
feet away from the big desk. Karen sat in one of the two small chairs and
waited. When the client came into the room, she expected him to sit down
next to her. Instead, he walked behind his giant desk and sat down in his
large chair. The distance between the two of them made it hard for Karen to
pay attention to what he was saying. She left the meeting feeling that the
physical distance between them had stopped them from having an in-depth
conversation.
Neatness Counts
Another part of body language is neatness. Being neat and organized plays an
important role in your interactions with customers.
How you look
Personal grooming has a big impact on your customers. Dirty hands and finger-
nails, messy hair, and body odor may be delicate topics to discuss, but the cost
of not dealing with them can mean the loss of otherwise happy customers.
Similarly, incomplete or dirty uniforms create a negative impression. If most
employees wear complete uniforms, but one is missing a cap, jacket, or tie,
that person sticks out like a sore thumb. This wardrobe oversight is seen by
customers as a sign of sloppiness and inconsistency.

Shall we dance?
As with touch, personal space is different
throughout the world. In general, most Asians,
especially the Japanese, tend to stand farther
apart than Europeans and North Americans.
Latin Americans and Middle Easterners, on the
other hand, stand much closer together.
A friend of ours was at an embassy cocktail
party where a South American gentleman was
talking with a Japanese gentleman. Our friend
reported that the two of them never stood still
the entire evening. They waltzed around the
room as the South American kept moving
closer, trying to close the gap between them,
and the Japanese gentleman kept backing
away, trying to increase the gap.

Coauthor Keith Bailey once was in a preliminary meeting with a financial
planner he was going to hire to help him organize his finances. Toward the
end of the meeting, the financial planner crossed his legs, and Keith caught 
a glimpse of the bottom of his left shoe, which had a hole in the sole. Keith
couldn’t help but think of this sloppiness as a bad sign for someone whose
job was promoting financial sufficiency; he ended up not hiring the man.
Whether this decision was fair or not took second place to the impression
that the hole in the shoe had left on Keith.
Customers expect you to look appropriate for the job you do. Don’t try to
have clean hands and fingernails if you’re an auto mechanic — customers
probably will get the impression that you’ve never lifted the hood of a car.
How your work area looks
The neatness of your work environment is especially important if your cus-
tomers have access to it. Customers make decisions about how organized
and competent you are by the way your desk or work area looks. If your desk
is piled high with papers, files, messages, and memos, making the excuse, “I
have a system, I know where everything is . . .” impresses only the gullible
and is a negative moment of truth for everyone else.
Customer logic has its own rules. One such rule is that the customer is
allowed to make what seem like unreasonable connections between totally
different things. A classic example of customer logic at work is the airline
executive who once noted that his passengers assumed that if their seat
pockets or trays were dirty, they couldn’t be sure that the airline did a good
job of servicing the airplane’s engines.
Small Things Mean a Lot
The information in this chapter can be summarized by an article we read
about a university library that wanted to study the effect that simple, inter-
personal actions had on students’ perceptions of the services they received.
They divided librarians who checked books out to students into two groups.
The first group was instructed to be efficient and help the students check the
books out without any added interpersonal skills, such as eye contact, smil-
ing, or physical contact. The other group of librarians was instructed to be
efficient and to add some interpersonal skills such as looking the customer 
in the eye, using his or her name (written on the library card), and casually
161
Chapter 10: A Wink, a Smile, and a Nod: Body Language

touching the customer on the wrist when giving the book back. Student-
customers were interviewed as they left the library and asked to share their
feelings about the service they had received.
Not surprisingly, customers who received efficient service and nothing else
agreed they received poor to fair service. Customers who received the added
interpersonal skills, on the other hand, reported they received good to excel-
lent service. The point: The little things we do with body language often have
the biggest impact.
The next time you’re a customer in a restaurant, hotel, or bank, take a
moment to evaluate how well the service person uses his or her body lan-
guage. The better you get at observing other people’s body language, the
more aware you become of your own.

In fact, almost the entire message you project to a customer over the phone
is communicated through your tone of voice. For example:
 A monotone and flat voice says to the customer, “I’m bored and have
absolutely no interest in what you’re talking about.”
 Slow speed and low pitch communicate the message, “I’m depressed
and want to be left alone.”
 A high-pitched and emphatic voice says, “I’m enthusiastic about this
subject.”
 An abrupt speed and loud tone say, “I’m angry and not open to input!”
 High pitch combined with drawn-out speed conveys, “I don’t believe
what I’m hearing.”
It doesn’t take long after a customer hears the tone of your voice to pick up
on your attitude. In fact, your customers know within ten seconds of initiat-
ing the call whether they’re talking to beauty or the beast. Some people you
speak to need only say “Hello,” before you find yourself thinking, “I don’t
want to deal with this person.” So you hang up and call again, hoping some-
one with a more compassionate tone picks up the phone.
Developing excellent telephone customer service (in both tone and words) is
one of the most valuable business skills you can acquire. In this chapter, we
cover five skills that can help you be a winner at using the phone.
Improving Your Inflection
If you’ve ever read a story to a child, you know that the words of the story
are far less interesting than the inflection you put into your voice. In fact, if
you get lazy and don’t make a ruff, grumbling sound when you say, “I’ll huff,
and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house down!” your child will more than likely
stop you and say, “Read it like you mean it.”
164
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 
If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a hundred times
When you’re saying the same thing again and
again, slipping into the habit of speaking in a
monotone voice is easy. The receptionist who
answers the phone by saying, “Good morning,
law offices of Smith, Smith, and Smith” a hun-
dred times a day can forget to put any life into
that greeting. Even though you’ve said some-
thing a thousand times, your customer may be
hearing it for the first time. So remember, using
inflection is as important with the first call of the
day as it is with the last.

Inflection is the wave-like movement of highs and lows in the pitch of your
voice. The peaks and valleys in your voice let your customers know how inter-
ested (or uninterested) you are in what they’re saying. Inflection also reflects
how interested you are in what you’re saying to the customer. When inflection
is missing, your voice can sound monotone (read boring and tedious).
Some people are born with naturally interesting voices, and they seem to
effortlessly use inflection to sound warm and friendly. Others, who aren’t so
fortunate, need practice. If you think that your vocal inflection needs some
polish, you can try the four techniques we describe in this section to improve
the quality of inflection in your voice.
Smiling when you talk on the phone
One way to positively affect the inflection in your voice is to smile, especially
when you first answer the telephone. The reason is not psychological but
rather physiological. When you smile, the soft palate at the back of your
mouth raises and makes the sound waves more fluid. For those of you who
sing in a choir (or in the shower), you know that the wider you open your
mouth and the more teeth you show, the better tone you get. The same
applies on the telephone. Smiling helps your voice to sound friendly, warm,
and receptive.
Some telemarketing companies are so convinced of the value of smiling when
talking on the phone that they install mirrors above telemarketers’ desks to
remind them to smile. These same people, by the way, call you when you’re
just sitting down to dinner.
165
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette
Beware of the disk jockey
Too much inflection is just as bad as too little.
Don’t scare your customers away by unleash-
ing on them your hidden desire to be a disk
jockey. Answering the phone with a resounding
have-we-got-a-deal-for-you tone of voice cre-
ates instant distrust. These are the people, 
usually from the we-got-your-number phone-
solicitation service or credit-card company,
who call as you’re sitting down to dinner and
excitedly say, “HELLO!” as if you’re a long lost
friend. This tone, as you know, is your cue to
hang up.

Changing the stress on the words
Another way to improve your inflection is to be aware of how stressing cer-
tain words changes the feeling of what you’re saying. The following sentence,
“What would you like us to do about it?” changes in feeling, meaning, and
tone when you:
 Say it defensively (emphasizing the words “would you”).
“What would you like us to do about it?”
 Say it with curiosity (emphasizing the words “like us”).
“What would you like us to do about it?”
 Say it with apathy (not emphasizing any of the words).
“What would you like us to do about it?”
Breathing
Believe it or not, the inflection in your voice can be greatly increased by learn-
ing to take long, slow, deep breaths. Most people become shallow breathers
when they’re under pressure. The next time you’re in a stressful situation, try
to notice what happens to your breathing. The more upset you become, the
shallower and quicker your breathing will be. When this breathing pattern hap-
pens, your vocal cords tend to tighten, making your voice go up and sound
strained. By being aware of your breathing, especially in stressful situations,
you can slow it down and thereby relax your vocal cords, bringing down your
pitch and creating a calmer tone of voice.
Exaggerating your tone
Whenever we’re asked to help someone who has a monotone speaking voice
improve his inflection, we have him start by practicing exaggerating his tone
using the following three steps:
1. Take a short and uncomplicated sentence like, “Bill isn’t here right
now,” and say it out loud with your normal level of inflection.
2. Think of inflection on a scale of one to ten, with one being monotone
and ten being a disk jockey. Now say the same sentence again, but this
time exaggerate your inflection all the way up to a ten.
Sometimes we ask people to visualize themselves as circus barkers under
the big top announcing to a noisy crowd of a thousand people, “Bill isn’t
here right now.” Practice this step and stop only when you sound really
obnoxious and embarrass yourself and everyone around you.
166
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

3. Say the same sentence again, but this time take your inflection down a
couple of notches to a level eight. Finally, say the sentence one more
time, taking it down to a level five or six.
Level five or six is a good level at which to keep your inflection over the
phone. If you find your inflection slipping over time, go back to Step 1
and repeat the process.
Adjusting the Volume
Imagine you’re at a party talking to a close friend when she leans toward you
and starts to tell you something private. She begins speaking in a soft voice,
almost a whisper. Invariably, as soon as your friend’s tone lowers, the people
standing nearby will strain their heads in your direction trying to hear what
is being said. Such is the power and uncanny magnetism of volume control.
Some of the most common ways to use volume control to your advantage
include the following:
 If a customer is angry and speaking loudly, don’t yell back at the same
volume even though your instinctive reaction may be to do so. Instead,
behave like a professional and start out by speaking at a somewhat
lower volume than the customer, gradually bringing the customer’s
volume down to yours.
 With a confused customer, speaking a little louder than usual helps give
him something to focus on and helps you control the conversation more
easily.
 Avoid starting out a conversation in too loud a tone of voice as this may
signal stress on your part and serve to unwittingly increase the cus-
tomer’s volume and stress level.
Pacing Yourself
Pacing is approximately matching your customer’s rate of speech and inten-
sity of feeling. Pacing is the best single tool you have for creating rapport
with your customer.
By focusing on the similarities (as opposed to the differences) between you
and your customer, you meet the customer at her level and make her feel at
ease.
167
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette

Matching your customer’s rate of speech
The average American speaks at a rate of 100 to 150 words per minute. The
average American listener, on the other hand, is capable of listening up to a
rate of 600 to 650 words per minute. So, some people will speak faster than
you do, some slower, and some at the same rate. By pacing a customer’s rate
of speech, you can close the gap and have more hits than misses in your tele-
phone communication.
One factor that significantly affects a person’s rate of speech is where he or
she comes from. See the next section for more.
Closing the geographic divide
Geographic location can influence the speed at which you talk. Two extremes
are native New Yorkers, who generally talk a mile a minute, and Southerners,
who are known for their slow drawl. If you put a Southerner and a New Yorker
together (we’ve seen it happen, and it isn’t a pretty story), the New Yorker
always is trying to get the Southerner to speed up, and the Southerner always
is trying to get the New Yorker to slow down. For any ground to be gained,
either the New Yorker or the Southerner must keep pace with the other.
As a service provider, your job is to keep pace with the customer — not the
other way around! If you notice that you’re thinking bad thoughts about your
customer, wondering why he is not slowing down or speeding up to your rate
of speech, quickly shift gears and move into a pacing mode. The point is that
you need to listen more carefully to your customer, and regardless of
whether they’re a fast or slow talker, it’s your job to adjust the pace you
speak at to mirror the speed at which your customer is speaking.
If you’re a fast-talking New Yorker on the phone with a customer from Texas,
remember to use the conversation as an opportunity to bridge the gap by
practicing your pacing skills and slowing way down.
Reflecting your customer’s intensity
Intensity is the strength of emotion that is projected along with the words
you’re saying. Your level of intensity changes with your level of concern. For
instance, saying, “I’m not ready yet” has a different level of intensity when
you’re getting dressed for a party than when you’re next in line to jump out of
a plane as a first-time skydiver.
The way your customers feel determines their level of vocal intensity. If they’re
calm and relaxed, their level of intensity probably is fairly low. If they’re upset
or angry, their level of intensity rises.

Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Imagine leaving your wallet, keys, or date book at a restaurant. When you call
the restaurant, you’re probably panicked and want quick action. The hostess,
wanting to calm you down and thinking your problem is no big deal (because
it happens all the time), may respond to your high intensity by being casual,
low key, and calm. The hostess believes this strategy is excellent for keeping
the situation under control. She’s wrong. This action has the opposite effect,
because she isn’t reflecting back to you the intensity of your concern. You’ll
know that you’re both on the same wavelength only when she paces you by
stating strongly: I will look for it immediately!
Telephone Etiquette
Unlike body language, which can vary from culture to culture, telephone 
etiquette has a universally agreed upon set of rules that paves the way for
smoother, faster, telephone calls with customers. Even small things, such as
how long it takes for your phone to be answered or the words you use when
you answer a call, can create a lasting impression. In many businesses, the
telephone is the customer’s first contact with a company, so being telephone-
friendly is one of the least expensive ways to immediately upgrade your serv-
ice. Telephone etiquette helps take the guesswork out of what to say and
when to say it.
169
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette
Testing your tele-tone
You can improve your tele-tone — the tone that
you use on the telephone — by trying the fol-
lowing exercise: Tape record yourself while
talking during a telephone call and then listen to
your voice on the tape. However, don’t record
your customers without asking their permission
first. (It’s impolite — and illegal. Remember
Watergate?) If you don’t feel comfortable taping
a real conversation, try taping yourself as you
role play with a co-worker. As you listen, use the
following questions to evaluate your tele-tone:
 Did I speak with inflection to show interest
and concern?
 Did I use a level of volume that gained the
customer’s attention?
 Did I pace the customer by adjusting my
rate of speech to match his or hers?
 Did I pace the customer by adjusting my
intensity to match his or hers?
If you’re a manager, you can support your staff
in improving their tele-tone by periodically lis-
tening in on their conversations and coaching
them afterward. Be sure to tell your staff when
you plan to listen in and why. Tell them that you
view this exercise as a positive opportunity for
them to improve their skills, not as a way for you
to catch them doing something wrong.

Good telephone etiquette is one way that you can help ensure that a cus-
tomer can call any department within your company, in any city, on any day,
and be dealt with in a uniform way. Customers love consistency, and they
expect to receive the same level of service that they received today when
they call tomorrow, next month, or next year.
Answering the phone
We’ve found that the way a company answers the phone tells the entire story
about the kind of service you can expect to receive. How you answer the
phone sets the tone of the entire call. The correct phrases said in the right
170
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 
The cursing caller
Once in a while, you get a call from a customer
who is so angry that he or she hurls words at
you that we can’t print. What do you do with the
cursing caller? We hear this question in almost
every seminar we lead. Telephone etiquette dic-
tates that you handle the situation with the fol-
lowing three steps:
1. Give the customer the benefit of the doubt
and politely say, “I really want to help you,
but I’m having trouble with the kind of lan-
guage you’re using. Can you please refrain
from using that kind of language?”
The customer may be so carried away with
emotion that he may not even realize he’s
cursing. After hearing this polite response,
most customers will stop to apologize and
will be a little embarrassed, but will be
much better-behaved. For the few who are
more thick-headed, move on to Step 2.
2. Give the agitated caller a second warning
and restate what you said in Step 1.
For example: “As I have said, I really want
to help you, but I’m having trouble focusing
on the problem because of the language
you’re using. Would you please stop?” Most
people, after the second warning, will
refrain from cursing. If the customer does
not stop at this point, your only alternative
is to catch him off guard by countering with
your own barrage of foul language . . . Just
kidding, of course. If all else fails, move on
to the final step.
3. Let the customer know that you’re no
longer the person who can help him, and
inform your supervisor of the problem.
Say, “As I have said, I really want to help
you, but I am having trouble with the lan-
guage you are using. What I am going to do
is have my supervisor call you to discuss
the problem.” Hang up and immediately
inform your supervisor of the situation. You
should only have to use this step on very
rare occasions.
If a caller starts threatening you physically (he
or she is going to come to your office, seek you
out, and so on), go immediately to Step 3.
Although you’re paid to provide service, you’re
not paid to be abused or threatened.

order can give a positive first impression and convey an immediate message
about your company. The basic rules are as follows:
 Pick up the phone within three rings.
 Greet the caller.
 Give your name or company name.
 Ask the customer if you can help.
Using the guidelines outlined above, three typical ways your company may
want to answer the phone are
 Direct line that goes right to an individual’s desk: “Good morning, this
is Andrew, how may I help you?”
 Company phone that goes to a receptionist or general incoming area:
“Good afternoon, Pine Box Productions, how may I help you?”
 Department phone that goes to a specific work group or department:
“Good morning, Technical Support, this is Andrew, how may I help you?”
 Voice mail: More and more companies are choosing the option of having
their main company phone answered by a voice-mail system. While we
are still fans of the old-fashioned idea that a “real person” should answer
the phone, we are realists. We understand that in some cases, voice mail
may be more efficient and provide the customer with faster service if
properly set up.
For more on how to use voice mail effectively see the section titled
“Voice-Mail Excellence.”
If you hear a common line (as opposed to someone’s personal line) ringing 
in your department and no one picks it up, make it your business to do so.
Remember, a person expecting a prompt response is on the other end. Even 
if you personally can’t help the caller, you can at least take a message and fur-
ther the cause of good customer relations.
171
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette
Last name grunt
Some people believe that because they only
deal with internal customers, they don’t need to
use good telephone etiquette, so they answer
their phones in a short, curt, or gruff manner. A
typical example is the last name grunt, where
the caller hears nothing but the quickly blurted
last name of the person picking up the phone.
Regardless of who is calling you, your phone
tone has an impact on how much rapport you
create with the caller.

Don’t make your greeting too long or over the top. One annoying trend that
we’re trying to stamp out is the greeting that tells us stuff we really don’t
want or need to know. This kind of greeting usually goes something like:
“Hello. It’s a beautiful day here at Spatula Cosmetics. How may I help you?”
This greeting is guaranteed to annoy even the most positive of customers
and invites mockery and sarcasm (especially in our office).
Call into your own company or department anonymously and see how well
you’re dealt with. How does your staff rate at answering the telephone, trans-
ferring your call, taking a message, and so on? If you think your staff will
know your voice, try having your spouse or significant other call.
Putting a customer (or co-worker) on hold
Most of the questions that we get from people attending our seminars about
putting customers on hold are about dealing with many different things at
one time — several people on hold, people in your face needing your atten-
tion, and so on. We’ve found that the biggest problem is the stress level of the
service provider. Without knowing the following steps, you can easily lose
control and stop thinking clearly. Using the proper etiquette for putting your
customers on hold helps you avoid becoming confused and befuddled, which
thereby helps you avoid the many negative moments of truth that customers
associate with the telephone.
The main points of telephone etiquette for putting customers on hold are
 Asking customers if you may put them on hold.
 Waiting for a response.
 Telling customers why they’re being put on hold.
 Giving the caller a time frame and explaining how long the caller will be
on hold.
 Thanking customers for holding after returning to the line.
172
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 
A trend we love
If you’re on hold and you’ve called a company
that has installed one of the newer, more-
sophisticated, auto-attendant technologies,
you’re given an approximate wait time and told
how many callers are waiting ahead of you. This
information, at least gives the customer some
control over whether she chooses to wait and
helps eliminate the I’ve-been-forgotten factor
you can feel when left on an indefinite hold.

As soon as the customer agrees to hold, be sure to say “thank you” before
clicking off the line.
Some confusion exists about the difference between keeping the customer
you’ve placed on hold well-informed with pertinent information and making
excuses for poor service. For example, imagine that you receive a call from a
customer who has not received a delivery. An informative response would be:
“May I put you on hold for a moment while I call the dispatch department?”
An excuse response would be: “I don’t know why that happened . . . I know
that we’ve had a few people out sick this week and things have been a little
backed up, but these circumstances shouldn’t have affected your delivery.
Let me put you on hold while I call them to see what’s going on.”
Sometimes being placed on hold is an inconvenience for callers, so don’t
automatically assume that they’ll accept. Whenever a caller responds with a
“No,” be sure to ask whether you can have someone return the call, take a
message, or transfer the caller to someone else.
Transferring the call
We’ve found that customers have the least telephone tolerance when they’re
being transferred again and again. Customers may think being shuffled from
department to department means that staff members are too overwhelmed
to care or that the company just isn’t interested in what they need.
173
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette
Silence can be golden
In our experience, most customers prefer to
have silence or soft music while they’re on hold.
Our hate list for on-hold strategies is as follows:
 Prerecorded advertising: Absolutely hands
down the worst! Apparently leaving you on
hold for an hour or two isn’t sufficient for
some companies; they want to add insult to
injury by subjecting you to endless adver-
tising slogans promoting their entire prod-
uct line and the superiority of their service.
 Weird computer music: Some companies
take a classical or popular piece of music,
usually Greensleeves, and play it on some-
thing that sounds like an electric hairpin.
Then the music is reconfigured for the high-
tech world in which we live. This type of
music is annoying and serves only to irritate
customers even more while they’re forced
to wait.
 Local radio station tuned in to the heavy-
metal retrospective program: Any music
that is loud, aggressive, or hurts the ears
isn’t what you want to play for customers
while they’re waiting on hold.

The main points of telephone etiquette for transferring a customer are
 Explaining why the caller is being transferred and to whom.
 Asking the customer whether he or she minds being transferred.
 Making sure someone picks up the call before you hang up.
 Telling the person to whom you’re transferring the call the caller’s name
and the nature of the call.
In the event the caller doesn’t want to be transferred, offer to take a message
and assure the customer that you’ll personally see to it that the message gets
into the hands of the right person. Then, after you hang up, see that the mes-
sage gets safely to its destination.
Taking a message
If you’ve ever received a hastily scribbled message with the caller’s name
misspelled and the phone number missing an area code, you know how frus-
trated you can feel as a service provider. As a customer, you likewise know
how you feel when you leave a message with someone whose sloppy attitude
leaves you feeling as if your message never will see the light of day. Poorly
taken messages produce uncertainty and worry for the customer and put the
person receiving the message at a disadvantage when she calls the customer
back. You can take messages that provide the customer with a sense of confi-
dence and empower your co-workers by incorporating the following steps in
your message-taking routine:
 Explaining your co-worker’s absence in a positive light.
 Informing the caller of the general availability of the person to whom he
wants to talk before asking for the caller’s name.
174
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 
Too much information
The best example of the worst explanation for a
person’s absence was when a secretary
informed us that her boss (the person we were
trying to reach) wasn’t in the office because he
and his wife were getting a divorce, and they
were at the lawyer’s office finalizing the divorce
papers. Believe us when we tell you that we
didn’t want to know that.

 Giving the caller an estimated time of your co-worker’s return.
 Offering to help the caller yourself, take a message, or transfer the call
to another capable party.
 Writing down all of the caller’s important information and attaching any
pertinent files.
You can always explain a co-worker’s absence in a positive light by using gen-
eral phrases that convey the message, but don’t reveal too much personal
information, such as:
 “Nan isn’t available at the moment.”
 “Nan stepped away from her desk.”
 “Nan is out of the office today.”
 “Nan is in a meeting.”
Ending the call
Even if you practice letter-perfect telephone etiquette throughout a call,
don’t underestimate the importance of ending the call on a positive note.
Some key actions for ending calls this way include:
 Repeating any action steps you’re going to take to ensure that you and
the customer agree on what’s going to be done.
 Asking the caller whether you can do anything else for him or her.
Doing so gives the customer a final chance to tie up any loose ends that
may not have been discussed during the call.
 Thanking the customer for calling and letting him know that you
appreciate his bringing the problem (if there was one) to your atten-
tion.
 Allowing the caller to hang up first so that she doesn’t accidentally get
cut off in the middle of a sentence.
 Writing down any important information as soon as you get off the
phone.
Doing so prevents you from getting caught up in other things and forget-
ting pertinent information.

Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette

Voice-Mail Excellence
No chapter on telephone skills is complete without a discussion of voice
mail. We find two opposing points of view on the subject of voice mail, and no
other topic, save for e-mail, can divide a room faster. Basically, some people
see voice mail as a great timesaver, but others view it as a customer-relations
killer.
Voice-mail adversaries
The main objections raised by service providers who dislike voice mail
center around their customers’ reactions to its use. Issues that we’ve heard
expressed, include the following:
 Will our customers object to talking to a machine?
 Won’t it remove the personal touch that we’ve always considered so
important?
 What if people don’t return their voice-mail messages promptly?
176
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 
What’s in a name?
When sorting through all of the possibilities for
addressing callers, you’re bound to ask, “What
salutation shall I use with my customers?” The
short list includes Mr., Mrs., Ms., Bill, (if that’s
his name), sir, madame, Your highness, and so
on. The possibilities are endless, and negotiat-
ing the shark-infested waters of remaining ser-
vice oriented and politically correct at the same
time can be difficult. Here are some tips that can
help you form a roadmap to addressing your
callers the way they like:
 Listen to your customers; they’ll tell you
how they like to be addressed.
“This is Dr. Smith.” (Call him Doctor.)
“This is Mrs. Simon.” (Call her Mrs.)
“This is Carol Cransbee.” (Call her Carol or
Ms. Cransbee, to be safe)
 When in doubt, play it safe and address
your female customers as Ms. rather than
Mrs. or Miss.
If she wants to be called something else,
she’ll let you know.
 Ask permission to use your caller’s first
name.
“May I call you Bob, Carol, Ted, or Alice?”
Good luck, and remember that if customers
don’t like what you call them, apologize and
address them the way they prefer.

From the customers’ point of view, the negatives of using voice mail include
the following:
 Being given a choice of eight different numbers to press, choosing
one, and then finding out that it was the wrong choice.
Some ill-designed voice-mail systems can trap you in a loop with no way
of reaching a live receptionist. You sometimes get caught in this trap
when you press 0 (zero) and get a recorded voice telling you: This is not
a valid option. The only way out is to hang up and call back.
 Leaving several voice messages and never getting a call back.
This problem has convinced some customers that voice mail is just
another obstacle in the way of getting the service they need.
Always give your customers a way out of voice mail so they have the option
of talking to a real person.
Voice-mail advocates
Undoubtedly, voice mail has a big upside. Three important benefits voiced by
service providers who are voice-mail fans are
 Voice mail saves time. The customer can leave detailed information that
the service person can act upon before calling the customer back.
 Voice mail provides better messages. Service providers who check
their voice mail regularly get messages faster than when they have to
depend on getting them from a co-worker who may not be readily avail-
able or who may be available but takes incomplete messages.
 Voice mail increases productivity by enabling you to switch it on
when you’re in a meeting or discussion in your office. Using voice mail
this way means that you’re not interrupted during your meeting and that
you can give your undivided attention to the customer when you return
his or her call.
Ten paths to voice-mail excellence
When used effectively, voice mail can enhance service by giving your cus-
tomers the quick answers they demand in today’s fast-paced world. The follow-
ing ten suggestions can help you enhance your voice-mail communications.
177
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette

No. 1: Don’t hide behind your voice mail
Whenever possible and practical, answer your own phone or take calls that
are forwarded to you by your assistant. Remember that although many
people don’t mind using voice mail, most prefer to speak with you directly.
Don’t sit at your desk, day after day, and let your voice-mail system intercept
all callers. We ran across one company where people almost never answered
their own phones, regardless of whether they were at their desks. The culture
of this company viewed phone calls from customers and co-workers as inter-
ruptions (instead of the essence). Good customer care requires that you
answer your phone most of the times that it rings — at least. When you do,
you send a positive message to your customers that you’re available and
want to help.
No. 2: Update your greeting regularly
How many times have you called someone only to be greeted by an out-of-
date voice-mail message? Say that it’s Wednesday, January 17. You hear a
greeting that goes something like this: “Hi. This is Ed. Today is Monday,
January 15, and I’ll be out of the office until Tuesday, January 16.” Besides 
the fact that this error is annoying, what impression do you get of Ed? Do 
you think that Ed is well organized and on top of his work? Probably not.
178
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 
Talking to a real person?!
Last year, coauthor Keith Bailey received a call
from his car lease company. Apparently, he’d
been sending his payments to an incorrect
address. When Keith picked up the phone, the
person on the other end asked whether she was
speaking to Mr. Bailey. After Keith confirmed
that she was, she said, “I have a very important
message for you.” Keith listened and after a few
seconds, a recorded message stated that his
payment had not been received and asked if he
was planning to send it right away. Keith just
wasn’t in the mood to have a conversation with
a machine, so he hung up. A week or so later,
he received another call — same company,
same person, same important message. This
time, determined not to be trapped in a one-
sided conversation, Keith said that he didn’t
want to talk to a machine. The line went silent
while the service agent regrouped after such an
impudent request. She then continued, “You
have to listen to the recording!” Keith politely
refused again. She retorted, “If you don’t 
listen to the recording, you’re going to have to
talk to a real person!” Keith found himself 
wondering . . . Is it me or is something very
wrong with this picture? Keith, like most cus-
tomers, wanted the option of dealing with a real
live person.

You always need to update your greetings to reflect your schedule and pro-
vide callers with the best time to reach you. Your callers need to be able to
figure out an expected time frame for a return call by the greeting you leave.
Additionally, if you’re going to be out of the office, away on vacation, or oth-
erwise away from your phone for a prolonged period of time, you need to let
your callers know when you’ll return and provide the name and number of a
co-worker who can assist them in your absence.
Record all greetings in a noise-free environment. Background conversation,
honking horns, barking dogs, and the like, create negative impressions and
communicate to your listener that you’re unprofessional. If your work envi-
ronment is noisy, try arriving at work early or staying late to record your
message — when less noise is likely.
No. 3: Respond to messages promptly
One common complaint that customers have about voice mail is the poten-
tial for a delayed response. If your callers don’t receive a response from you
within a reasonable period of time (usually a day or two), they begin thinking
that voice mail is an ineffective way of communicating with you. Remember
that callers will feel secure and comfortable leaving you voice-mail messages
only if you consistently get back to them in a timely fashion.
Get in the habit of checking for messages at least three times a day, including
every time you return to your office from lunch or a meeting. After you receive
a message, you need to act immediately. Choose one of these options:
 Reply immediately.
 Forward the message to someone else for action.
 Save or write down the message for reply at a later date.
 Delete the message.
When forwarding a voice-mail message to another user, be sure to add an
introduction that explains when the message was originally left, why you’re
forwarding it, and what actions, if any, you want the other person to take.
No. 4: Encourage your callers to leave effective messages
The more specific the information that callers leave, the better the chances
are that you’ll be able to get back to them with a response or take the action
they need and desire. Encourage your callers to leave more effective mes-
sages. Craft your voice-mail greeting so that you ask for:
 The reason for the call and any specific information that you need to
know.
 An e-mail, if necessary, that conveys any additional, helpful details.
179
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette

 The caller’s phone number. Many people, in the rush to leave a detailed
message, forget to leave their number. Consider incorporating into your
greeting a statement like, “Please leave your phone number, even if you
think I already have it.”
No. 5: Give callers the option of skipping your voice-mail greeting
Nothing is more frustrating than being forced to listen to a voice-mail greet-
ing that you’ve already heard at least ten times. You can set up most phone
systems so that your caller can bypass your greeting by pressing the pound
(#) key. The caller then goes straight to leaving a message. Although you may
need or want to leave a lengthy greeting to provide important information,
enable frequent callers (who presumably already know the information that
you put in your greeting) to skip it. Likewise, if your system permits, give
your callers the option of pressing 0 (zero) to reach a company operator.
No. 6: Plan and prepare your return calls
You can save time and effort by carefully planning your return calls. Making
specific notes on what you want to cover — rather than relying on memory —
can reduce the amount of time you spend on the phone when you return a call.
You can also make your calls more efficient by stating a time frame, for exam-
ple, “Bob, I wanted to get back to you with this information, but I only have
about five minutes to talk.”
The best times of day to return phone calls are 1⁄2 hour before lunch and 1⁄2
hour before the end of the day. People have less time to chat at these times
and are more focused on getting the job done so that they can leave for lunch
or go home.
No. 7: Provide a context for your call
Breakdowns in voice-mail communication that lead to telephone tag, or unnec-
essary back-and-forth phone calls, and frustration most often occur because
of three mistaken assumptions on the caller’s part. You can instantly improve
your voice-mail messages by never assuming that the person you’re calling:
 Recognizes your voice. No matter how well you think he knows you or
how many times you’ve spoken with him on the phone, assuming that
the person you’re calling on business will recognize your voice is a mis-
take. Always state your name at the beginning of your message. Doing so
keeps the receiver from having to listen to your message a dozen times
to figure out who the heck called.
 Has your phone number handy. Make it easy for the person you’re calling
to respond to your call by including your phone number in your message.
Don’t make him do the extra work of looking up your phone number.
180
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Remember that he may be checking his messages away from the office
and may not have your number with him (or may have lost your number).
 Knows what you’re talking about. When responding to a voice message,
don’t assume that the person you’re calling knows which message
you’re referring to. Instead, introduce your response with an opening
that explains why you’re calling. For example, say something like, “Hi,
Cheshta. This is Ginger. I’m getting back to you on the message you left
me regarding your billing problem.”
No. 8: Keep your outgoing messages short and to the point
Americans who work in corporations receive an average of 175 fax, e-mail,
telephone, and voice-mail messages per day. Don’t add to this burden by
leaving rambling messages. Limit the length of your voice messages to
between 20 seconds and two minutes. After a couple of minutes, you risk
annoying or even losing your listener. Likewise, you want to avoid unfocused
messages that obscure the purpose of your call.
Before you leave a message (albeit before ever making a call), know the
points you want to cover and focus on one topic per message. If you group
several topics together into one message, the person you’re calling may wait
until she can address all the topics before taking action or responding. In
addition, single-topic messages are easier to forward.
If you’re calling to ask a question, ask it directly. Rather than saying, “Hi. This
is Cynthia. I have a question. Call me back.” leave your actual question on the
voice mail. By doing so, the recipient can prepare an answer before calling
you back, thus saving both of you time and effort.
No. 9: Specify the response you expect
Giving the people you call some guidance on how you’d like for them to
respond makes things easy on them. If your call is simply an FYI and you
don’t expect a response, say so. If you want them to take action, be specific:
 Please let me know that you received this message.
 Please call or e-mail me back with your response.
 Please take care of this immediately.
 I need this item by next Tuesday; please let me know if you can do this.
Many voice-mail systems give you the option of marking a message as urgent.
Use this feature sparingly! You don’t want to run the risk of becoming the
voice-mail equivalent of the boy who cried, “Wolf!” Marking too many voice
mails as urgent can lead to a situation in which you send a message that
really needs immediate attention, but based on your frequent use of the
urgent feature, it’s automatically sent to the bottom of the return pile.
181
Chapter 11: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: Phone Tone and Etiquette

No. 10: Take security measures
Unauthorized entry into your voice mail can potentially cause anything from
embarrassment to disaster for you and your company. Take the following
measures to increase your mailbox security:
 Use five to ten digits for your security code. The more numbers you
use, the harder it is for someone to figure out the code.
 Avoid overly simple or obvious codes. Obvious numbers, such as your
birth date, anniversary, or repetitious numbers such as 2222, are too
easy to figure out. To reduce the risk of your mail being broken into,
choose a code that’s not so obvious.
 Memorize your code. Don’t keep your code written in the phone direc-
tory of your time management system or on a slip of paper you carry in
your wallet. Instead, take some time to commit it to memory.
 Change your code. Just to be safe, occasionally change the access 
code that you use for voice mail. Doing so is especially important if an
employee who knew the code has left the company or if you think the
code has been compromised in any way.

It Takes Two to Tango: Getting in
Step with Your Customer
In This Chapter
 Defining your working style
 Getting acquainted with four distinct working styles
 Working in step with different working styles
Your customers fall into two general categories: the ones who think and
behave similar to the way you do and the ones who don’t. With the first
group, you often seem to know what they’re going to say (even before they say
it), how they respond, and what it takes to satisfy them. The second group of
customers is obviously harder to relate to. You’re often surprised by what they
say, puzzled by how they react, and uncertain about how to satisfy them.
The most successful service providers have discovered how to work with
both groups of customers, especially the ones who think and act differently.
We call these differences working styles, and they reflect the various ways
that people behave at work. Understanding your working style and the styles
of those around you dramatically improves your communication with cus-
tomers, co-workers, and even your boss. Think of getting to know these
styles as the customer service equivalent of learning a new language. When
you can speak another person’s language, it becomes easier to understand —
and be understood by — that person. You start by identifying your own indi-
vidual working style. Then, you need to figure out how to get in step with
your customers’ styles.
What’s My Style?
Consider each of the questions that follow separately and circle the letter 
(a, b, c, or d) that corresponds with the description that best fits you. If you
have trouble selecting only one answer, ask yourself which response would
be the most natural or likely for you to make at work.

Scoring the questionnaire
After you finish the questionnaire, review the following scoring sheet (shown
in Figure 12-1). You can score yourself on these four specific working styles:
 Driver (DR)
 Expressive (EX)
 Amiable (AM)
 Analytical (AY)
Later in this chapter, we explain each style in detail, but first transfer your
answers from the questionnaire to the scoring sheet and then count up the
number of times you circled each style. Enter these scores at the bottom of
the scoring sheet. The style where you scored the most points is your pri-
mary working style.
What does working style measure?
Research on the general concept of individual styles goes back to the work of
Carl Jung, the famous psychiatrist. Since Jung’s day, many researchers, psy-
chologists, and consultants have studied and further developed the concept
of styles. One thing that all the researchers agree on is that these styles mea-
sure two important aspects of a person’s behavior: how emotionally expres-
sive you are and the degree to which you assert yourself.

Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Gauging emotional expression
The degree to which you show or hold back your emotions helps determine
your style. In particular, emotions are expressed in these four ways:
 Verbally: What type of language do you use? Are your discussions filled
with colorful metaphors and larger-than-life phrases, or do you tend to
say things in an understated way? The types of words you use and the
way you use them is a direct reflection of your working style.
 Vocally: Are you a fast talker or do you go at a slow and easy pace? Do
you use a great deal of intensity and excitement in your voice, or do you
usually sound calm and relaxed? The tone you use communicates as
much about your working style as the words themselves.
 Through body language: Do you talk with your hands or hold them by
your side when you speak? Do you walk at a brisk pace, or do you prefer
a leisurely stroll? Your body movements tell a story about which work-
ing style is the most natural to you.
 Through your environment: Do you have a neat and tidy office with
charts and graphs, or do you prefer posters and motivational sayings
plastered on your walls? Your office environment provides a clue to the
type of working style you have.
Examining the levels of assertiveness
Assertiveness relates to how much or how little you try to influence and con-
trol the actions and opinions of the people around you. If your working style
reflects a high degree of assertiveness, others probably see you as forceful and
direct. A lower degree usually signifies being more reserved and easygoing.
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that one style is better or more desirable
than another. Everyone expresses himself or herself differently, and each
style adds to the richness of your working environment. Wanting to trade
your style for the one that you’ve always yearned for is as fruitless as want-
ing another personality. Appreciate the way you are and read on to discover
ways that you can adapt your style to better communicate with the people
around you.

Looking for more information?
The four work-style terms (driver, expressive,
amiable, and analytical) originally were coined
by Dr. David Merrill, founder of Tracom
Consulting Group. If you’re interested in reading
more about the research done by Dr. Merrill and
his associates, read Personal Styles and
Effective Performance: Make Your Style Work
for You, by David Merrill and Roger Reid
(Chilton, 1981).

Understanding Your Working Style
Your working style describes how you primarily approach and deal with
people and situations at work, although many of our clients tell us that they
see similarities that carry over into their personal lives.
If you have two scores that are the same and you’re uncertain about which
style is yours, you need to be able to pinpoint where you fit in by reading
through the descriptions of each of the four primary styles presented later 
in this chapter. If that doesn’t work, ask a co-worker, spouse, or close friend
which working style they think you have — they usually know.
You can gain a better understand your working style, by plotting your scores
on a working-styles grid like the one shown in Figure 12-2) and by reading and
sorting through the descriptions of the working styles in the sections that
follow.
We recommend that you read through all four of the working style descrip-
tions because understanding the other three styles can help you become
more sensitive and flexible with customers and co-workers who have a style
different from your own.
The analytical working style
The analytical working style, found in the top-left corner of the grid in Figure
12-2, has a low degree of assertiveness and a low degree of emotional expres-
sion. People with this style focus on facts more than feelings. They evaluate
situations objectively and gather plenty of data before making a decision.
They prefer an organized work environment where they know exactly what 
is expected of them. Words that describe this style include the following:
 Serious
 Well-organized
 Systematic
 Logical
 Factual
 Reserved

Chapter 12: It Takes Two to Tango: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Strengths of the analytical style
Their natural inclination toward fact-finding makes analyticals good problem
solvers who have the patience to examine the details and come up with a log-
ical solution. They can work independently, and as such, they are well-suited
for the finance, science, and computer fields. Bill Gates is the perfect example
of this working style.
Weaknesses of the analytical style
Analyticals place facts and accuracy ahead of feelings, and they sometimes
are seen by others as emotionally distant. Under stress, they have a tendency
to overanalyze to avoid making a decision. Because analyticals are uncom-
fortable with feelings — their own and others’ — they may avoid expressing
feelings even when doing so would be the best thing to do.
Key analytical behaviors
People with the analytical working style tend to
 Show little facial expression
 Have controlled body movement with slow gestures
 Have little inflection in their voice and may tend toward monotone
 Use language that is precise and focuses on specific details
 Have charts, graphs, and statistics displayed in their office
The driver working style
The driver working style, found in the top-right corner of the Figure 12-2 grid,
has a high degree of assertiveness and a low degree of emotional expression.
People with this style know where they want to go and how they are going to
get there. They are good at managing tasks and are results-oriented. Drivers
like competition, especially when they win. Words that describe this style
include:
 Decisive
 Independent
 Efficient
 Intense
 Deliberate
 Achieving
192
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Strengths of the driver style
The ability to take charge of situations and make quick decisions are what
often make drivers high achievers. They put a single-minded focus on the goals
they want and are not afraid to take risks to accomplish them. They do well in
positions of authority, can work independently, and are well-suited for being
lawyers, surgeons, and CEOs. Donald Trump is a good example of someone
with the driver working style.
Weaknesses of the driver style
When feeling stressed, drivers can be so focused on getting things done
quickly that they can overlook details and make mistakes. They may push
aside their own and other’s feelings to get the job done, which can create
tense situations with co-workers. Because of their hard-driving, competitive
nature, drivers can sometimes become workaholics.
Key driver behaviors
People with the driver working style tend to
 Make direct eye contact
 Move quickly and briskly with purpose
 Speak forcefully and fast-paced
 Use direct, bottom-line language
 Have planning calendars and project outlines displayed in their offices
The amiable working style
The amiable working style, found in the bottom-left corner of the Figure 12-2
grid, has a low degree of assertiveness and a high degree of emotional expres-
sion. People with this style are responsive and friendly — but not necessarily
forceful or direct. Words that describe this working style include:
 Cooperative
 Friendly
 Supportive
 Patient
 Relaxed
193
Chapter 12: It Takes Two to Tango: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Strengths of the amiable style
Amiables are generally good listeners to whom others come for support.
Their sensitivity to the feelings of others makes them good collaborators who
thrive in team environments. They’re well-suited for the helping professions,
such as nurses, therapists, teachers, and so on. A good example of the ami-
able working style is that of Katie Couric.
Weaknesses of the amiable style
Amiables often have trouble asserting themselves and making decisions
quickly. Generally, they don’t like confronting disagreement with co-workers,
and their reluctance to deal with conflict means that they don’t always get
what they really want. Their frustration about not resolving such issues can
turn into resentment that is directed toward the same co-worker in later
interactions.
Key amiable behaviors
People with the amiable working style tend to
 Have a friendly facial expression
 Make frequent eye contact
 Use nonaggressive, nondramatic gestures.
 Speak slowly and in soft tones with moderate inflection
 Use language that is supportive and encouraging
 Display plenty of family pictures in their offices
The expressive working style
The expressive working style, found in the bottom-right corner of the Figure
12-2 grid, has a high degree of assertiveness and a high degree of emotional
expression. People with this style are outgoing and persuasive. They’re
enthusiastic, friendly, and prefer to work with other people. Expressives
thrive in the spotlight. Words that describe this working style include:
 Outgoing
 Enthusiastic
 Persuasive
 Humorous
 Gregarious
 Lively
194
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Strengths of the expressive style
Expressives have a lively nature, and because of that, they are able to motivate
and generate excitement in others. They work at a fast pace and are good at
building alliances and relationships to accomplish their goals. They are well-
suited for high-profile positions that require them to make public presenta-
tions, such as trainers, actors, salespeople, and so on. Robin Williams is a
famous example of someone with an expressive working style.
Weaknesses of the expressive style
When expressives are upset, they can often communicate their feelings with
considerable intensity, and if criticized, they may lash out with a verbal attack.
They may seem overwhelming to less assertive styles, because when they’re
enthusiastic about an idea, they press for a decision and may overlook impor-
tant details.
Key expressive behaviors
People with the expressive working style tend to
 Use rapid hand and arm gestures
 Speak quickly with plenty of animation and inflection
195
Chapter 12: It Takes Two to Tango: Getting in Step with Your Customer
Sorting out your backup style
Although most people usually have one primary
working style, many people have a backup style.
This style is the one that you fall back on when
you’re under pressure. Your second highest
questionnaire score usually indicates your
backup style. For example, although your pri-
mary style may be expressive, when you’re
under pressure, you take on some driver style
behaviors. When under stress, people with all
four styles react one of two ways: They become
either more active or more passive. Drivers and
expressives (the more assertive of the four
styles) become more active and aggressive
under pressure. Amiables and analyticals (the
less assertive of the four) become less active
and less responsible under pressure. These
general behaviors are associated with each
style when under pressure:
 Drivers become more autocratic and
demanding.
 Expressives show their emotions by ver-
bally attacking others in conflict situations.
 Amiables give in and put their own feelings
aside.
 Analyticals handle conflict by avoiding the
situation.
Typically none of these responses resolves con-
flict. Therefore, being able to predict how you
and others are likely to react under pressure
and modifying those reactions can reduce con-
flict between you and your co-workers.

 Have a wide range of facial expressions
 Use language that is persuasive
 Have a workspace cluttered with inspirational items
Getting in Step with Different Styles
Customers and co-workers with different working styles require different
types of approaches. By understanding and adapting to the style of the
person with whom you’re dealing, you can create stronger rapport and
deliver better service. This technique of style stepping is especially important
in difficult situations in which the probability for misunderstanding or confu-
sion is heightened.
Everybody uses aspects from all four working styles to some degree.
Although the behaviors that you use the most reflect your particular working
style, the others you use less frequently make up a smaller part of how you
express yourself. Practicing style stepping gives you a chance to emphasize
these little-used aspects of your working style.
The four scenarios in the sections that follow take place between a bookstore
sales clerk and a customer. They show you how people with different work
styles typically interact with one another. The first sketch in each scenario
takes place before style stepping occurs, and although the sales clerk is
polite and efficient, he or she misses the mark with the customer, because
the conversation is on the service person’s terms rather than the customer’s
terms. The second sketch in each scenario shows you how using style step-
ping enables the clerk to create more rapport and understanding by adapting
to the customer’s working style.
You first need to check out the scenario that features your own working style.
Becoming more familiar with it can help you be more sensitive to how others
view your style. Next find the scenario that contains the style of a customer
or co-worker. Notice what you may have to change to get in step with their
style.
Many people are concerned that style stepping means being artificial with
people. If you’re thinking, “Won’t I seem phony if I am always being flexible to
the other person’s style?” take heart in knowing that style stepping doesn’t
replace your personality, but it does enhance your ability to get your ideas
across to others.
196
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Assessing a customer’s style
Being able to quickly assess what working style your customer or co-worker
has is a big part of becoming a good style stepper. Figuring out the styles of
your co-workers is easy, because you’re around them all the time. Customers,
however, can be trickier, because you don’t have a great deal of time to make
an assessment of their styles. The more you use style stepping, though, the
better you can become at recognizing each working style. When trying to
evaluate a customer’s style, we recommend that you keep it simple by asking
yourself these two questions:
 Is this person asserting his or her needs, wants, and opinions a lot or 
a little?
 Is this person expressing his or her feelings and emotions a lot or a
little?
The answers you come up with should point you in the right direction.
Amiable and driver
In this scenario, the clerk has the amiable working style, and the customer
has the driver working style.
Clerk:
(in a pleasant tone) Good afternoon, how are you today?
Customer:
Fine. I’m looking for a book called How to Get 25 Hours
Out Of Your Day. Do you have it?
Clerk:
I’m not sure; I’ll have to look it up. Sounds like an inter-
esting book. Where did you hear about it?
Customer:
(impatiently looking at his watch) A friend. The author is
Stan Workmore. Do you have it?
Clerk:
(looking at computer screen) Let me see . . . Mr. Workmore
has written several books. Have you read anything else
by him?
Customer:
I’m really in a hurry; do you have it?
Clerk:
Yes, here it is. We have one copy left; it’s in the back
stockroom. Why don’t you relax and look around while I
go find it for you?
Customer:
I don’t have the time. Could you get it for me now?
Clerk:
Sure, I’ll be back in just a minute.
197
Chapter 12: It Takes Two to Tango: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Getting in step with drivers
From this scenario, you find that drivers obviously are not big on small talk,
and they like to get speedy results. Style-stepping behaviors for working with
drivers include:
 Making direct eye contact
 Speaking at a fast pace
 Getting down to business quickly
 Arriving on time and not lingering
 Being clear, specific, and brief in your conversation
 Not over-explaining or rambling
 Being organized and well prepared
 Focusing on the results to be produced
Using style stepping
In this scenario, the clerk’s natural style is amiable, but he style steps to
bridge the gap between his style and the driver style of his customer.
Clerk:
(with a pleasant voice) Good afternoon, how are you
today?
Customer:
Fine. I’m looking for a book called How to Get 25 Hours
Out Of Your Day. Do you have it?
Clerk:
I can find out. What’s the author’s name?
Customer:
Stan Workmore.
Clerk:
We have one copy left. My co-worker, Nancy, can ring it
up for you while I get the book from the stockroom.
Customer:
Thanks for taking care of this so quickly.
Clerk:
No problem.
The general rule when it comes to stepping into another style is this: A little
goes a long way. In this revised scenario (and the ones to come later in the
section), the clerk didn’t go over the top when style stepping. Instead, the
clerk shows just enough flexibility to make the customer feel comfortable and
taken care of.
Analytical and amiable
In this scenario, the clerk has an analytical working style, and the customer
has the amiable working style.
198
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

Clerk:
Can I help you with anything?
Customer:
(pleasantly) I’m looking for a book called How to Get 25
Hours Out Of Your Day. Do you have it?
Clerk:
(matter-of-factly) I’ve never heard of it, and I wouldn’t
want to guess. I can look it up in the books in print if
you’d like.
Customer:
I’d really appreciate it if you would.
Clerk:
Can you tell me the exact spelling of the author’s name,
the publisher, and the year the book was published?
Customer:
The author’s name is Stan Workmore. I’m really sorry, but
I don’t know who the publisher is. Can you still help me?
Clerk:
I’ll do my best, but Mr. Workmore has written several
books, and without more specific information, it will take
me that much longer to locate it.
Customer:
That’s okay. I’ll be more than happy to wait while you
look it up.
Clerk:
Okay, here it is. I’ve managed to find it. The publisher is
Toilaway & Company. It was published in June of 1993. I
have one copy left, and that should be located in our
back stockroom. I’ll go and get it. Will you wait here?
Customer:
I think I’ll go have a cup of coffee in your cafe while I’m
waiting.
Clerk:
Where exactly will you be sitting, so I can find you?
Getting in step with amiables
This scenario shows how the amiable customer couldn’t care less about any
of the details that are so important to the analytical sales clerk. Style-stepping
behaviors for working with amiables include:
 Making eye contact but looking away once in a while
 Speaking at a moderate pace and with a softer voice
 Not using a harsh tone of voice or language
 Asking them for their opinions and ideas

Using style stepping
In this scenario, the clerk’s natural working style is analytical, but she style
steps to bridge the gap between her style and the amiable customer.
Clerk:
Can I help you with anything?
Customer:
I’m looking for a book called How to Get 25 Hours Out Of
Your Day. Do you have it?
Clerk:
(with empathy) I’m sorry, but I haven’t heard of it. Would
you like me to look it up for you?
Customer:
I would really appreciate it if you could.
Clerk:
Can you tell me the author’s name and perhaps the 
publisher?
Customer:
The author’s name is Stan Workmore. I’m really sorry, but
I don’t know who the publisher is. Can you still help me?
Clerk:
Of course; this will take me a few minutes to look up.
Here it is. We have one copy left in the stockroom. Would
you mind waiting here while I get it?
Customer:
No problem. Thanks for helping me out.
Clerk:
My pleasure.
Expressive and analytical
In this scenario, the clerk has the expressive working style, and the customer
has the analytical working style.
Clerk:
Good morning. How can I help you?
Customer:
I’m looking for How to Get 25 Hours Out Of Your Day; it’s
by Stan Workmore and published by Toilaway &
Company. Can you tell me where I can find it in the store?
Clerk:
(enthusiastically) Now that sounds like something we
could all use. What did you say that author’s name was
again?
Customer:
Stan Workmore, W-O-R-K-M-O-R-E. Do you want to write it
down?
Clerk:
No, I’ve got it. What a perfect name for the author of that
book. Okay, here it is. You’ll be pleased to know we have
one copy left in the back. If you hold on just a second, I’ll
run and get it for you.

Customer:
How long exactly will this take? I have an 11 o’clock

Getting in step with analyticals
Remember that analyticals focus on facts, details, and logic. They are uncom-
fortable with expressing feelings and aren’t very outgoing. When dealing with
them, you need to emphasize the rational, objective aspects of what you’re
discussing. Style-stepping behaviors for working with analyticals include:
 Not speaking with a loud or fast-paced voice
 Being more formal in your speech and mannerisms
 Presenting the pros and cons of an idea, along with the options
 Not overstating the benefits of something
 Following up in writing
 Being on time and keeping it brief
 Showing how your approach has little risk
Using style stepping
In this scenario, the clerk’s natural working style is expressive, but he style
steps to bridge the gap between his style and his analytical customer.
Clerk:
Good morning. What a great day. How can I help you?
Customer:
I’m looking for How to Get 25 Hours Out Of Your Day; it’s
by Stan Workmore and published by Toilaway &
Company. Can you tell me where I can find it in the store?
Clerk:
(seriously) I can locate that for you. Can you spell the
author’s last name for me please?
Customer:
Stan Workmore, W-O-R-K-M-O-R-E. Do you want to write it
down?
Clerk:
Yes. I’ll make a note of it. I have it. There’s one copy left.
It’s in the stockroom; if you’ll please wait, I’ll go get it 
for you.
Customer:
How long exactly will that take? I have an 11 o’clock
meeting.
Clerk:
No longer than five minutes.

Driver and expressive
In this scenario, the clerk has the driver working style, and the customer has
the expressive working style.
Clerk:
Can I help you?
Customer:
(enthusiastically) Hi, how are you? I’m looking for How to
Get 25 Hours Out Of Your Day. Isn’t that a great title? All
my friends have read it, and they just love it!
Clerk:
(looking at his watch) Who’s the author?
Customer:
Oh, he’s a wonderful man. I’ve met him. You won’t believe
his name; it’s Stan Workmore. Isn’t that the perfect name?
Clerk:
We have it. I need to go in the back to get it. Why don’t
you pay Nancy here while I go get the book?
Customer:
Sounds like a wonderful idea. I think I’ll grab a cup of
coffee in the cafe while you get the book.
Clerk:
No, don’t do that — you won’t have time. I’ll be back in
just a minute. Wait here. I will be right back with your
book.
Customer:
Sure, I’ll just talk with Nancy while I wait. Hello, Nancy. . . .
Getting in step with expressives
Expressives are the most outgoing and gregarious of all the work styles, and
they’re best approached by focusing on generalities rather than on details.
Expressives usually respond well to playful people who focus on the big pic-
ture. Style-stepping behaviors for working with expressives include:
 Making direct eye contact
 Having energetic and fast-paced speech
 Allowing time in the meeting for socializing
 Talking about experiences, people, and opinions, in addition to the facts
 Asking about their intuitive sense of things
 Supporting your ideas with testimonials from people whom they know
and like
 Paraphrasing any agreements made
 Maintaining a balance between fun and reaching objectives
Using style stepping
In this scenario, the clerk’s natural working style is driver, but she style steps
to bridge the gap between her style and her expressive customer.

Style-Stepping Opportunities
Many situations at work provide good opportunities to use style stepping.
They include:
 Making a sales presentation: We hear many success stories from clients
who say redesigning their sales pitch to fit their customer’s language has
closed sales that previously were elusive.
 Conflicts between you and a customer: By stopping and listening to
your customer’s style, you can quickly redirect your approach to him or
her so that you have a better chance of resolving disagreements.
 Presenting your ideas to your manager: Style stepping with your man-
ager can make the difference between your ideas being acted upon or
ignored. In our workshops, we often see good ideas lost, because the
staff person wasn’t able to present them in a way that made sense to the
manager’s way of thinking.
 Developing teamwork: Style stepping, in many ways, is the essence of
good teamwork. Knowing and appreciating the different styles of the
people on your team makes understanding their points-of-view and
coming to a consensus decision easier.

Chapter 12: It Takes Two to Tango: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Creating a Customer Profile
In some situations, taking the time to sit down and preplan an upcoming 
conversation can be useful for achieving a win-win resolution. The customer
profile form shown in Figure 12-3 is best used when a challenging situation
confronts you, and you have a specific objective that you want to achieve. 
You can also use the customer profile form to plan conversations with co-
workers and bosses, in addition to customers.
Create a customer profile by following these four steps:
1. Determine the customer’s primary working style.
Based on your observations, what is this customer’s primary style? If
you aren’t sure, read the descriptions for each style found earlier in this
chapter, and choose the one that fits the best.
2. Set your objective.
One key to successful customer profiling is setting clear and achievable
outcomes. Objectives that are too vague, such as, “I want to improve my
relationship with Liza, my co-worker,” make it difficult to assess what
exactly needs to happen to achieve the goal. This assessment works
better when you define your outcome more specifically, such as, “I want
Liza and I to agree on how we are going to solve the overtime problem.”
3. Look at the big picture.
Step back for a moment, consider your working style and the working
style of the customer, ask what potential trouble spots you may
encounter, and decide what ideas you and the customer are likely to
agree on or have in common. By thinking about trouble spots ahead of
time, you can plan for a more successful interaction.
4. Plan a rapport strategy.
After your analysis is complete, plan what actions you can take to create
a rapport with your customer (or co-worker) and achieve the result you
want. At this point, you may want to review the earlier section about
“Getting in Step with Different Styles” and use that information as a basis
for your strategy.
Be as specific as possible when you write down your strategy actions.
For example:
• Be on time to my meeting with Bob.
• Prepare a chart with all the information on it.
• Ask Bob what his ideas are for solving the problem.
• Explain to Bob how I arrived at the solution, step by step.
• Give Bob a one-page overview of the proposed solution.

Turning Service Excellence 
into Sales Success: Five 
Timeless Techniques
In This Chapter
 Grabbing and holding your customer’s attention
 Finding out what your customer really wants and needs
 Interrupting a customer when you have to get down to business
I
n most companies, the sales and service departments are separate, but in
reality, the services those departments provide are greatly interrelated.
For example, if the sales department makes promises that can’t be fulfilled
(not that this ever happens), the firm’s service reputation suffers. The same
is true if the service department doesn’t adequately support customers after
the sale. Understanding the connections between sales and service becomes
especially critical when your service staff is expected to cross-sell to existing
customers or simply suggest alternatives that can lead to new sales.
In Chapter 2, we talk about the two aspects of your daily work: functions and
essence. You can get so bogged down with the multitude of ceaseless tasks
that the essence of your job, communicating and establishing relationships,
is overlooked, and the customer ultimately suffers. The steps involved in suc-
cessful selling also are functions, structured procedures that help deal with
predictable customer responses and concerns. However, if these tools are
used without a backdrop of appreciation and a commitment to relationship-
building, they become nothing more than techniques that customers can
easily construe as coercion.
Customers are far more likely to buy from you when they think you’re listen-
ing to their needs and earnestly trying to serve them. By viewing sales as
another great opportunity to serve your customer, you can use the five tech-
niques we discuss in this chapter to aid you in creating better rapport and
making your sales calls more efficient.

Technique 1: Getting the 
Customer’s Attention
You may find it hard to believe, but your customers don’t always pay a great
deal of attention to what you’re saying. Or, if they are paying attention, they
may not be thrilled by what they hear. That’s why beginning a sales conversa-
tion by saying something that grabs your customer’s attention often is a good
idea.
Foot-in-the-door, attention-grabbing methods are far from customer-focused.
For example, most people hate getting a call from a telemarketer who sounds
just a little too friendly and a tad too enthusiastic. Hearing an over-the-top,
high-toned, “Hello, how are you today?” is one sure way of getting you to
immediately hang up the phone. So, don’t try and grab your customer’s atten-
tion with false impressions or bogus offerings; it never works because they —
like you — see through it every time.
In this section, we offer four approaches you can try to get your customer’s
attention in a positive and customer-friendly way.
Using a dramatic statement
Dramatic statements can be statistics or events that are surprising and/or
thought-provoking. For example, we recently were stopped in our tracks
when one of our vendors stated, “Sixty-eight percent of U.S. employees who
use e-mail at work have sent or received e-mail that could place their com-
pany at risk.” This statement grabbed our attention, because we thought it
was a surprisingly high statistic — and it related to a subject for which we
offer trainings.
Another example is a company that recently approached us regarding its facil-
ities for printing our workbooks via the Web. One of its attention-grabbing
statements was, “If you e-mail us your original by 7 p.m., it will be copied and
overnight-shipped that same day.” Wow! We were impressed and interested in
learning more.
Making a third-party reference
Making a reference to a third party can turn a cold call into a warm call,
because mentioning a mutual relationship adds a sort of instant credibility.
For example, we recently contacted Gina, a potential client who had been rec-
ommended by Ted, a manager in another division of the same company, and
208
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

a current client of ours. When we mentioned Ted’s name at the beginning of
the call, Gina immediately shifted gears, slowed down, and became more
interested in what we were offering. Given her busy schedule, we doubt we
would’ve grabbed Gina’s attention without having a third-party reference.
When you’re talking to a sales lead and referencing someone you know, or
have worked with, be sure to mention how long you’ve known that person,
the kind of projects you’ve undertaken, the results produced, and anything
relevant about the relationship that adds more credibility and depth to the
relationship.
Quoting an industry authority
Quoting an authority is similar to quoting a third-party reference, but the
third party, in this case, is an industry leader rather than a business associ-
ate. This tool is especially powerful when your product or service addresses
issues that have received recent media coverage. For example, a software
company we work with encourages its sales team to quote recent reports and
research that supports their products. To this end, it sends a monthly e-mail
to its sales staff that provides Web links to all the latest, relevant industry
findings.
Asking a key question
We know an investment advisor who often begins his sales pitch with the
question, “Did you know that you can take the money you have sitting in your
IRA account and invest it in real estate with all the same tax benefits?” He has
found that asking a direct and compelling question usually gets a good con-
versation started.
Here are some ideas for topics for key questions accompanied by sample
questions:
 The benefits of using your product or service: “Everybody knows how
important it is to back up company data but can you imagine, with our
automated product, never having to back up your data again?”
 Recent findings related to your industry. “Did you know that these
types of engines are the most rapidly growing segment of the market?”
 Compelling industry statistics. “Are you prepared for the summer rush?
We expect to see a 30-percent increase in tanning product sales this year.”
 Surprise questions. “Would you like a free month of service so that you
can really evaluate our product?”
209
Chapter 13: Turning Service Excellence into Sales Success

Technique 2: Asking Questions
Asking a question is like opening a door. When you ask prospective customers
questions, you’re inviting them to talk, and if you’re listening carefully, the
customers will tell you what their needs or concerns are. That’s how you can
find out more about your customers. Open-ended questions are best for begin-
ning a conversation and priming the pump for a productive interaction.
Sometimes, however, conversations can wander off into unrelated side waters
that are unproductive and time-consuming. When that happens, you need to
lasso the customer back on track by asking closed-ended questions.
Open-ended questions
Open-ended questions begin with the words how, what, where, why, and
when. They cannot be answered with a simple yes or no answer. Here are
some typical examples:
 How do you expect your business to change over the next year?
 What differences do you find between the larger and smaller models?
 Where would you foresee using our product?
 Why do you think that?
 When do you expect to make a decision?
Closed-ended questions
Closed-ended questions tend to evoke one-word answers. They are handy
when you want to narrow the scope of the conversation and close the sale.
Closed-ended questions usually begin with words like do, will, can, are, and
so on. Here are some examples:
 Do you want me to invoice you?
 Will you send me the purchase order number?
 Can I send you a sample?
 Are you happy with your current vendor?

Technique 3: Making Benefit Statements
Benefits, as the word implies, let customers know what the product or service
will do for them. Sometimes you find that when members of your service staff
are selling, they get caught up in the features of their product but fail to go the
extra step to extract the benefits of the features they’re crooning about.
For instance, coauthor Keith Bailey and his wife went car shopping at a local
dealership, and the showroom salesman began going over the many features
of the model in which they were interested. As they listened to him go on and
on about the number of valves, the intricacies of the strut bars, and the won-
ders of the four cams, they became more and more frustrated. They wanted
to know how those features translated into something they could relate to —
driving the car! Had the salesman been more benefit-oriented, he would’ve
said things like, “It’s a really quiet, smooth ride with easy steering and good
road holding capabilities, even in bad weather.”
Benefit statements can also be used to show a potential client your interest in
him or her specifically. For example, “You’ve told me that your company is
expanding rapidly, and that expansion creates a concern that communica-
tions in the organization will suffer. This software has the ability to produce
real-time data that anyone can access at anytime, increasing the level of com-
munications within your organization.” 
Table 13-1 provides a list of assorted features accompanied by the benefits
they provide. At the end of the table, we provided a few blank lines for you to
add the features of your product or service. After writing down your features
in the left column, think about what benefits they provide for your cus-
tomers, and write them down in the spaces in the right column.

Have the members of your staff do the above exercise, and then have them
develop a simple sales script that emphasizes the benefits of your product.
Having some authorship interest in their scripts makes it easier for members
of your staff to adopt the technique and sound even more authentic to your
customers.
Technique 4: Backtracking
Backtracking is a technique that has two purposes: It tells customers that
you’ve heard what they’ve said and gives you the opportunity to make sure
that you understand the customer correctly. Sometimes called active listen-
ing, backtracking means that you paraphrase what you hear customers
saying and then repeat it back to them.
For example, if a customer says, “I am very concerned about price. If I pay
$250 per month now, can you guarantee that the amount won’t fluctuate
wildly in the months to come?” In response, the staff person backtracks by
saying, “Mr. Smith I understand your concern about fluctuations in price and
wanting some certainty about what you’ll be paying month to month. . . .”
Paraphrasing is a simple and powerful technique that provides the customer
with an important — yet often neglected — fundamental of excellent service:
being heard and understood.
Speed isn’t always as important as understanding, and solutions are more
satisfying to everyone when they are presented with empathy and efficiency.
Technique 5: Bridging
Part of the challenge of selling services is balancing good listening skills with
call efficiency. Customers can easily become derailed during a conversation
or ramble on long after the point has been made. Waiting around for the con-
versation to get back on track can take a long time and therefore is obviously
212
Part III: Keeping Your Customers: Simple Actions, Significant Payoffs 

inefficient. Bridging is a three-part technique for politely steering the sales
conversation in the direction you want it to go, while retaining good rapport.
Read on for more info on each part of this valuable technique.
Step 1: Catching their breath
Bridging requires you to interrupt customers when they’re talking. We know
that sounds rude — but it doesn’t have to be, if you simply wait for them to
take a breath. If customers are excited or speaking quickly, you may have to
listen intently as they suck up more air — but we guarantee they eventually
will. And when they do, a short gap will occur in the conversation. That’s
when you seize the moment to interrupt. Because they’re pausing momentar-
ily, your cutting-in seems less abrupt.
Step 2: Showing empathy
Making an empathic statement further softens the abruptness of cutting 
into the conversation. For example, if you are cross-selling an enhanced
insurance package to a customer, the conversation may go off track when the
customer responds in the following way: “I want the policies mailed to my
work address. The last time policies were mailed to my home, the dog got to
them before I did, and they were shredded out of existence. She’s a poodle,
and they’re not usually aggressive, but when she hears the mail man, she
turns into a monster. I used to have a St. Bernard, and he could’ve taken the
door off if he’s wanted to. . . .”
Heard enough? Okay, wait for the breath and then show empathy by saying
something like: “I can see how not receiving your policies would be a big
inconvenience.” Then move on to Step 3.
Step 3: Redirecting the conversation
Having interrupted with empathy, the last part of bridging is steering the 
conversation back in the direction you want it to go. Continuing the chewed-
policy example, redirecting the conversation may sound like this: “I can see
how not receiving your policies would be a big inconvenience. I’ll make sure
the policies are mailed to your business, but first I want to finish going over
the new limits of the policy.”
Bridging is useful in any situation in which you need to move forward and the
other customer (or anyone else you’re talking to) is hung up on a diversion.
The good thing about bridging: It works both over the phone and in face-to-
face situations.

 Exploring your customers’ six basic needs
 Knowing what to do when you have to say no
N
o! Nein! Non! Nyet! No matter which language you say it in, customers
don’t like to hear the word no. Regardless of where you are in the
world, your customers want what they want, when they want it, and how
they want it. If they don’t get what they want, they’re probably going to be
disappointed, frustrated, or upset.
Imagine how you’d feel in any of the following situations:
 Your dentist tells you that he unexpectedly ran out of nitrous oxide, and
you can’t have the gas you requested for the root canal you scheduled.
 While out with some friends, you offer to pay for dinner. A few minutes
after giving the waiter your credit card, he returns with an apologetic
facial expression and tells you that your card was declined.
 You return from lunch and realize that you left your wallet or purse at
the restaurant. You call the restaurant, and the hostess tells you that
nobody has handed anything in.
 You arrive late at the airport and after running three miles to the gate,
you discover that your flight has already departed. The service agent
tells you that no other flight is leaving tonight.
Like it or not, you and every other service person from time to time must say
no to your customers (whether you want to or not). Many companies tout
the belief that service is giving customers what they want, and when you can,
you should. The problem is that service providers often have this belief so
etched in their minds that when they can’t give customers what they want 

(in other words, they have to say no), they feel helpless and often fail to use
other techniques that may bring about a satisfactory conclusion to a difficult
situation.
In this chapter, we look at a few circumstances that make saying yes impossi-
ble, and then we show you how to say no (when you have to) and still make
customers happy by making sure you’re meeting their needs and giving them
as much as you can.
Circumstances that Make It 
Impossible to Say Yes
No business in the world can say yes to every customer request and stay in
business. Like it or not, circumstances exist that require you to say no to
your customers. These situations include the following examples:
 Federal regulations: Certain rules and regulations may be imposed on
your business (depending on the industry you’re in) by an outside gov-
ernment agency. For example, if you work in a bank, you’d have to say
no to a customer who wanted to open a business account that paid
interest, because Federal Regulation Q prohibits banks from paying
interest on business accounts.
 The law: Companies must comply with federal and state laws. For exam-
ple, if you’re a car rental agent and a customer can’t produce his driver’s
license, you can’t rent a car to him, even if you know him personally. A
friend of ours is a vice president at a car rental company, and he was
unable to rent a car to a friend when she visited from out of town,
because she had an expired driver’s license.
 Company policies and procedures: These restrictions are imposed not
because of a legal requirement but rather as part of the company’s rules
regarding how it conducts its business. For example, if you work as a
salesperson in a retail store, you may not be able to refund a return item
that a customer brings in because she is unable to find the sales receipt.
 Out of stock: For whatever reason, the item the customer wants is tem-
porarily unavailable. For example, you work in an ice cream parlor and a
customer comes in salivating with excitement for a chocolate-fudge,
double-malted shake with whipped cream — and you’ve just sold the
very last scoop of chocolate-fudge ice cream.
 Just not possible: Sometimes a customer makes a request that just isn’t
possible to fulfill. For example: You’re a hairdresser and one of your
clients who has short hair asks for a style that would require her to grow
another three inches of hair while sitting in the chair!
218
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Saying Yes versus Making 
Customers Happy
The belief that saying yes and giving your customer what he wants will auto-
matically make a happy customer is an easy trap to fall into. It doesn’t always
work that way. You can see on a visit to your local post office how this theory
works. In general, the post office is well-stocked and rarely, if ever, runs out of
stamps, money orders, and so on. Almost everyone who goes to the post
office leaves having received exactly what he expected to get. If getting what
you want were the only criteria, then the post office should be the greatest
service provider on the planet. Yet, in our office, we toss a coin to see who
has to go. One reason is the guaranteed long line; another is the somber atti-
tude of the clerks and so on. The point is you get what you want (stamps,
packages mailed, and so on), but you don’t necessarily end up with that I-
can’t-wait-to-go-back-for-more great service feeling!
The opposite also is true. As a customer, you can end up not getting what you
want and still feeling like you received good customer service. Imagine you’re
in the ice cream parlor again, asking for that chocolate-fudge, double-malted
shake with whipped cream. The person at the counter apologizes and tells
you that he unfortunately is out of chocolate-fudge ice cream. However, he
doesn’t leave it at that. Instead, he invites you to try a sample of a new flavor
called Decadent Cocoa Overload. You try it and swoon! The counter person
makes you a Decadent Cocoa Overload double-malted shake, and adds an
extra-big blob of whipped cream. You leave in sugar shock — but happy.

work and having the energy and time to go after
them requires learning to say no to some things.
Here are some phrases that can help you
gracefully get out of doing something you can’t
or don’t want to do:
 I don’t think I’m the right person for this job.
 I have a lot on my plate right now.
 I’m not comfortable with that.
 I can’t do it right now.
 I don’t want to; or, no thank you, I’m not
interested.
 Doing this would require me to change 
priorities.

In the ice cream parlor example, the service provider had to say no to the
customer but knew that when he couldn’t give the customer what she
wanted, his job then was to fulfill as many of her other needs as possible:
 By apologizing, he showed empathy toward the customer’s 
disappointment.
 When he offered the customer a taste of a second type of ice cream, he
provided an alternative to the customer’s first choice.
 By putting extra whipped cream on the shake, he provided the customer
with a care token as part of bounce-back initiative. (Care tokens and
bounce-back initiative are powerful service tools that are explained in
Chapter 16.)
The key to scoring high marks with the customer, regardless of whether you
say yes or no, is always asking yourself the question: “What does this cus-
tomer need, and how can I provide it to the best of my ability?”
The Customer’s Six Basic Needs — 
Are You Meeting Them?
By talking to thousands of customers and service providers during the past
few years, we found that customers seem to carry around a sort of invisible
report card in their heads. Without fully realizing it, every time they do busi-
ness with you, customers are keeping score not only on how well you’re
giving them what they want but also on fulfilling six basic customer needs. In
this section, we list those needs along with related scenarios as told to us by
people attending our workshops.
A popular piece of customer-service folklore states that if you give customers
what they ask for (just say yes), you end up with satisfied customers. This
folklore is false. Customers do ask for what they want, but they usually don’t
ask for the six basic needs outlined in this section. When did you last go into
a pizzeria and say, “I’d like one slice of pepperoni pizza, please,” and then
add, “Can you please be understanding, friendly, and fair?” Although cus-
tomers don’t ask for these other needs, they nonetheless expect such ges-
tures and miss them when they aren’t provided. So you need to move beyond
the yes folklore and fulfill all your customers’ needs to be able to provide top-
quality customer service.
Friendliness
Friendliness is the most basic of all customer needs, and it’s usually associ-
ated with being greeted politely and courteously.

Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Cliff, a San Francisco building contractor, always stops at the same coffee
shop for breakfast, even though it’s out of his way. He says the food is good,
yet it’s pretty much the same as he can get closer to home. He keeps going
back because he loves the way the servers always are friendly and upbeat,
calling him by name and usually having his coffee poured as he is walking in
the door. By adding this extra value to Cliff’s breakfast eating experience, the
coffee shop separates itself from other cafes and competes on more than just
the ham-and-eggs level.
Understanding and empathy
Customers need to feel that the person providing the service understands and
appreciates their circumstances and feelings without criticism or judgment.
Gayle, vice president of a public relations firm, got an unexpected promotion
and had to relocate within two weeks from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Atlanta,
Georgia. To help her find a new home, she called Peachtree Realty (located, inci-
dentally, in the Peachtree Shopping Center on the corner of Peachtree Road and
Peachtree Avenue). Susan, the real estate agent at Peachtree Realty, understood
the time pressure that Gayle was under, so she faxed Gayle a description of 
the various neighborhoods within 30 minutes of Gayle’s new office (including
houses for sale and prices). Doing so made Gayle feel that Susan was able to
stand in her shoes and empathize with her situation.
Fairness
The need to be treated fairly is high on most customers’ lists of needs.
Donna, a telephone receptionist, was waiting in line at a supermarket when a
checker opened the next checkout lane. The person in line behind Donna
pushed his cart past hers and made a mad dash to the checkout stand that had
just opened. The checkout clerk, to his credit, politely asked the pushy cus-
tomer to allow those who were in the front of the line to go first. By standing up
for what was fair, the clerk impressed everyone (except, of course, the pushy
customer) and fulfilled Donna’s need for being treated fairly as a customer.
Control
Control represents the need of customers to feel as if they have an impact on
the way things turn out.
Richard, a software engineer, planned to leave work early one day to meet the
cable company representative at home for a repair. About an hour before he
was supposed to leave work, the cable company called to let him know the
221
Chapter 14: Saying No: What to Do When You Can’t Say Yes

representative was running about 30 minutes behind. This gesture by the
cable company gave Richard control. He was able to reorganize his schedule
so that he could stay and finish the project he was working on instead of
waiting around at home and growing more angry and frustrated with each
passing minute, wondering what was going on.
Options and alternatives
Customers need to feel that other avenues are available to accomplish what
they want.
Rona, a lawyer with a Washington, D.C., law firm, was preparing an important
case for a court appearance at the end of the week. As part of her research,
she needed a recent report from a large U.S. car manufacturer. When she
called to request the report, the car manufacturer informed her that it had
not yet been published. She explained why she needed the report and the
urgency of the situation. The car company came up with a solution by send-
ing Rona, via an e-mail attachment, a draft copy of the report.
Information
Customers need to be educated and informed about the products, policies,
and procedures they encounter when dealing with your company.
Milton, a human resources director, is a novice tennis player who went to a
local pro shop to buy his first tennis racquet. Understanding that Milton
needed to be educated about the fine points of buying a tennis racquet, the
store manager took the time to explain the differences between the many
types of strings and such and why prices varied from one racquet to the next.
By the time Milton left the shop, he not only had a tennis racquet that he felt
good about buying, but he also had a better understanding of how a racquet
can affect the game.
Different strokes for different folks
The needs of your customers not only vary according to their individual 
personalities, but they can also change depending on the nature of your busi-
ness. A trip to Disneyland, for example, is remembered for the fun and safety
of the park and rides. These two service qualities are part of what makes a
day with the mouse so enjoyable and memorable. Compare this excursion
with a visit to your accountants. In that situation, your needs are more in the
realm of accuracy and certainty. You’d be mighty suspicious if your accountant
222
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

was having fun — when you weren’t — and started to laugh uncontrollably
during a meeting.
Besides the six basic customer needs, dozens more exist that are specific to
different businesses and occupations. See Table 14-1 for a list of some of the
many customer needs we have discovered over the years.
Using the needs listed in Table 14-1, check off the six that you consider the
most important to your customers. Ask your staff to do the same. Compare
lists, and report the results to your staff. Then you can schedule a brain-
storming session (see Chapter 6) with your staff to evaluate how well you
think you’re fulfilling those customer needs and how you can improve the
ones that need more attention.

What to Do When You Have to Say No
Given that saying no is a fact of life and that sooner or later you’ll have to
deliver bad news to the customer, your choice is not whether you say no but
how you say it. You can say no the hard way, or you can say it the service way.
Avoiding the hard no
Nothing turns an uncomfortable no situation into a heated argument like a serv-
ice person who thinks that her job is to be the brick wall that stands between
the customer and what he wants. Saying no that way without empathy or any
expression of desire to help is infuriating to the customer. The underlying atti-
tude of the hard no is “no way, no how, never in a million years!”
You can always tell you’re facing a hard no as a customer when you ask the
service person whether any other easy solution is available to whatever situ-
ation you’re dealing with, and she says, “No!” Then you ask for a recommen-
dation about what to do next, and she says, “I don’t know!” Finally, you come
up with some possible options, and she systematically shoots them down,
one by one. Get the picture? You’re facing a hard no!
From observing customers and service providers during the last ten years,
we’re convinced that a hard-no approach takes more time and effort than the
service-no approach.
224
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Opting for the service no
Although giving customers a hard no clearly doesn’t work, we’re not suggest-
ing that you somehow try to make a no sound like a yes. No technique can
accomplish that feat — except lying! We’ve seen many service providers who,
not wanting to confront the situation honestly, tried to keep customers happy
by bending the truth. Doing so gives customers the unrealistic expectation
that they’re going to get what they want, and sooner or later, when they dis-
cover that they’ve been misled, they’re going to be even more upset!
Manipulating customers into thinking you’re saying yes when you’re really
saying no is not the answer and neither is hoping that a no will be received
with joy and understanding.
Serving up a service-no sandwich
The solution is a technique that we teach our clients called the service-no
sandwich. This technique requires no culinary training and helps ensure a suc-
cessful outcome with a customer who can’t get exactly what he or she wants.
We’ve used the sandwich technique for years when we have to say no, and it
works with most customers — except the 1 percent who won’t change their
attitudes even if you levitate in front of them! It’s called a sandwich technique
because the slices of bread (so to speak) are represented by two phrases that
are wrapped around a filling of recommended actions. The two phrases are:
 What I can do is . . .
This phrase tells customers that you want to help them and gives them
specific actions you can take to get their problem(s) resolved. The alter-
native actions that you offer may not be exactly what the customer wants,
225
Chapter 14: Saying No: What to Do When You Can’t Say Yes
How to drive a customer crazy
Nothing drives customers crazier than not get-
ting what they want from a service provider
who treats them like an adversary and isn’t
interested in looking for ways to help them
resolve their situations. Some of the one-liners
(said, of course, in a monotone voice) that
clearly reflect this “I don’t care,” hard-no atti-
tude are:
 That’s not our policy.
 That’s not my job.
 I’m not allowed to do that.
 I have no idea.
The body language that accompanies these
responses can be:
 A blank stare
 Head held down
 Look-away eyes
 Distracted fidgeting

but they usually can help create an acceptable resolution to the problem
and reduce the customer’s feeling of frustration.
 What you can do is . . .
This second phrase tells customers that they have some control over
the outcome of the situation and that you consider them your partners
in getting the problem resolved. Possible suggestions for customers may
involve recommendations for a temporary fix to the problem or actions
that the customer can take in the future to prevent the problem from
occurring again.
Putting the sandwich technique into practice
Two common situations in which using the service-no sandwich technique
turns a potentially hard-no situation into a service-no success are described
in the two scenarios that follow.
Scenario 1: A customer calls the insurance office where you work, concerned
and upset about a monthly bill he’s just received that shows no record of last
month’s payment being made. In addition, the customer has been charged a
late fee. Because the customer says he paid the bill on time, he wants you to
waive the late charge immediately.
After sincerely apologizing for the inconvenience this problem has caused
the customer, you whip out your ever-handy service-no sandwich technique
and say, “What I can do is see whether we’ve received the check since your
bill was sent. If we have, then I’ll waive the late fee. If not, I can’t remove the
late fee today, but what you can do is fax me a copy of the canceled check,
and as soon as I receive it, I can waive the late fee.”
Scenario 2: A customer calls the store where you work to order a product
that your company sells. You’re temporarily out of stock and therefore must
say no. After apologizing to the customer for the inconvenience and
empathizing with her disappointment, you say, “What I can do is place the
item on back order and ship it out to you by two-day mail when it arrives.
What you can do is give me a credit-card number over the phone so that I can
complete the paperwork now and ship the product out as soon as it arrives.”
You may still need to give the customer an explanation like the policy, but
when you do, remember to put that phrase at the end of this technique, after
you have given another option.

Difficult Customers

 Overcoming personal stress and stressful situations
S
ervice providers who don’t know how to work well with difficult people
lose their hair, their marbles, and their customers. The nature of your
job as a service provider requires that you sometimes work with customers
who drive you up a wall. Regardless of whether your customers are rude,
frustrated, confused, or irate, most minor clashes don’t have to turn into
guerrilla warfare.
Six Steps to Beat the Heat 
of a Difficult Customer
Knowing when you’re losing control when dealing with a difficult customer
isn’t always easy. However, certain red flags do pop up, such as:
 Tight neck and shoulders
 Cringing at the sound of the customer’s voice
 Dreading the ringing of the telephone
 Headaches
 Anger
 Being short or curt
 Raising your voice unnecessarily
 Straining the tone of your voice

 Breaking out in hives
 Grinding your teeth
When you notice any of these symptoms, don’t worry. Instead, use the basic
six-step process that we outline in this section to help you get through the
trying times with difficult customers. Practice makes perfect when dealing
with the worst of the worst. The more you use these six steps, the better you
become at winning over difficult customers and keeping yourself sane.
Step 1: Let the customer vent
When your customers are upset, they want two things: First, they want to
express their feelings, and second they want their problem solved. The cus-
tomers’ need to let off steam can be so strong that they vent to the first person
they get their hands on, even if it is just a receptionist. Some service providers
view the customers’ venting as a waste of time because they simply want to
move on and solve the problem. However, trying to resolve the situation with-
out first listening to the customers’ feelings never seems to work. Only after
your customers have vented can they begin to hear what you have to say.
Zip your lip
Nothing heats up already angry customers faster than being told to calm
down while they’re venting. If you try to stop customers from expressing
their feelings, you can push them from annoyed to irate in a matter of sec-
onds. The best plan is to stay quiet and not make matters worse by interrupt-
ing the customer. In particular, here’s a list of phrases you want to avoid:
 You don’t seem to understand . . .
 You must be confused . . .
 You have to . . .
 We won’t . . . We never . . . We can’t . . .
 You’re wrong . . .
 It’s not our policy . . .
Although you don’t want to interrupt customers when they’re venting, you do
want to let the customers know that you’re listening to them. You should do
the following three things while they vent:
 Nod your head frequently.
 Say uh-huh from time to time.
 Maintain eye contact.
228
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Don’t take it personally
When customers vent, they may be expressing frustration, annoyance, disap-
pointment, or anger. Of all of these emotions, anger is the one you’re most
likely to take personally because anger is such an in-your-face emotion. Raised
voices, bulging blood vessels, rude comments about your mother, and wag-
ging fists can make you want to run and hide or retaliate.
Anger is an emotion that’s always looking for someone or something to blame.
If you stub your toe on the couch, you get angry at the couch. If a mosquito
bites you, you get angry at the mosquito. If you lock your keys in your car, you
get angry at yourself and then give the tire a good kick to vent your frustration.
Even though the customer’s anger may appear to be directed at you, remember
that you’re simply the person she’s venting to, so don’t take it personally.
Step 2: Avoid getting trapped 
in a negative filter
The friction between you and a difficult customer is often worsened by how
you interpret her behaviors. Take a moment and think of some of the names
that you call your difficult customers — of course, not to their face, but pri-
vately, under your breath. You may even want to jot a few of your favorites
down in disappearing ink.
229
Chapter 15: Seeing Red: Dealing with Difficult Customers
Negative filter name-calling
Through our seminars, we hear many different
names and descriptions for difficult customers.
Some of the most popular are
 Jerk
 Bozo
 Rude
 Stupid
 Creep
 Liar
 Pushy
 Clueless
 Moron
 Turkey
 Loser
 X#%**&*!!
As soon as you pin one of these labels on a cus-
tomer, it becomes a negative filter that dramat-
ically changes how you see, speak, and listen
to the other person.

How a negative filter is born
The following is an example of how a negative filter is created in a conversa-
tion between a bank teller and a customer:
Customer: Good morning. I want to deposit this check.
Teller: The back isn’t signed!
Customer: Sorry about that, do you have a pen?
Teller (sighing): Yes, here.
Customer: By the way, I ran out of deposit slips and don’t know my
account number. Will you please look it up for me?
At this point in the conversation, the teller suddenly finds himself thinking:
“This person is stupid!” The instant the teller has this thought, an invisible,
negative filter comes down between him and the customer. From then on, the
manner in which he relates to the customer is distorted by the negative filter.
The teller’s choice of words and his tone of voice reflects his silent opinion 
of the customer. The rest of the conversation would probably go something
like this:
Teller: Most people can remember their account number.
Customer (feeling scolded): I know and I’m sorry, but like I said, I don’t
have a deposit slip, and I didn’t write down my account number.
Teller (annoyed and sighing again): You’ll have to wait while I go look it
up. Maybe you should write your number down and keep it in your wallet.
230
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 
Negative filters are contagious
We were teaching customer service to the staff
of a large hospital when we discovered that
nurses on different shifts were unintentionally
giving their negative filters to each other. The
night nurses would write down a few comments
about their patients’ behaviors on the bottom of
their charts. Sometimes the comments were
positive, but sometimes they were negative. For
example: “Mr. Smith has been in a very bad
mood tonight.” When the day nurse came on
duty, she would pick up the chart and, boom,
just like that, she had an instant negative filter
about Mr. Smith. The day nurse, in turn, then
noted her negative comments about Mr. Smith,
reinforcing the night nurse’s point of view, and
so on. Within a day or two, word would get
around that Mr. Smith in Room 206 was a pain in
the elbow, and all the nurses on the floor, day or
night, knew to be on guard when dealing with
him. If left unchecked, negative filters can get
out of control and spread like wildfire, creating
a situation where positive communication with
a customer becomes extremely difficult, if not
impossible.

The service provider is speaking to the customer as if she is stupid. Being a
professional, he knows better than to come right out and say, “Hey, lady,
you’re not too bright, are you?” Unfortunately, the negative filter still comes
through, loud and clear.
Choosing to switch filters rather than fight
Inevitably, you have negative filters about some of your customers, some of
the time. The idea is to avoid getting stuck in these negative filters.
Understanding the harmful effects of a negative filter won’t necessarily make
them go away, but you do have a choice about whether you focus on them.
To get out of a negative filter, you need to switch to a service filter. You do so
by asking yourself the following question: “What does this customer need and
how can I provide it?” This question provides you with an alternative filter
because as soon as you ask it, your focus changes. The negative filter
instantly slides into the background, and the service filter slides into the fore-
ground. The switching technique works in much the same way as a flashlight
in a dark room: By changing where you aim your attention, you illuminate the
issues that need to be addressed — instead of illuminating your personal feel-
ings about the customer’s behavior.
Step 3: Express empathy to the customer
If you give customers a chance to vent, they eventually run out of steam.
When that happens, you can begin to participate more actively in the conver-
sation. Giving a brief and sincere expression of empathy works wonders to
calm a difficult customer. Empathy means appreciating and understanding
someone else’s feelings, even if you don’t necessarily agree with them. By let-
ting customers know that you understand why they’re upset, you begin build-
ing a bridge of rapport.
Empathy is not sympathy. Sympathy is when you over-identify with the other
person’s situation. For example, say an angry customer comes up to you 
and says, “Your company really doesn’t care about service!” A sympathetic
response to that statement is, “You’re right, we care more about the almighty
dollar than anything else!”
Using empathic phrases
Empathic phrases are a simple and easy way of conveying that you under-
stand your customer’s situation. The types of phrases that best express
empathy to a customer include the following:
231
Chapter 15: Seeing Red: Dealing with Difficult Customers

 I can see why you feel that way.
 I see what you mean.
 That must be very upsetting.
 I understand how frustrating this must be.
 I’m sorry about this.
Always saying you’re sorry
Some service providers feel uncomfortable apologizing to the customer
because they see it as an admission of guilt. Saying I’m sorry to a customer
doesn’t imply that you or your company did anything wrong. Apologizing
simply conveys that you’re genuinely sorry that the customer has had a bad
experience. See Chapter 17 for more details on apologizing to customers.
The tone of your voice goes a long way in helping you convey empathy. If you
say all the right words but deliver them with an icy tone, the words may have
an insincere ring to them. By using a genuinely warm and caring tone, you
enhance the meaning and effectiveness of the empathic phrases.
Step 4: Begin active problem solving
Until now, you’ve been on the receiving end of the conversation with your
customer. At this point, you can begin active problem solving by asking ques-
tions that help clarify the cause of the customer’s problem.
As you ask the customer questions, be sure to listen to everything he says and
don’t jump to conclusions. Because you may have been through similar situa-
tions before, you may think that you already know the answer. However, this
can cause you to miss details that are specific to this customer’s situation.
Gathering additional information
Customers sometimes leave out critical information because they think it’s
unimportant or they just forget to tell you. When you need specific informa-
tion from a customer, use the bridging technique. This technique, which is
especially helpful when a customer’s complaints have veered in an unproduc-
tive direction, builds a bridge between what the customer is saying and
where you want the conversation to go. As you notice the conversation veer-
ing off track, wait for the customer to take a breath. (It may be a quick breath,
but they all have to breathe eventually.) This is your cue to jump in with an
empathic phrase followed by a question that steers the conversation back on
course. For example, the customer may say
I never asked for a subscription to your publication. I don’t even like your pub-
lication. How did you get my name? Did you buy it from a mailing list com-
pany? I get so much junk mail that I had to get a bigger mailbox . . . (breath).
232
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

At this point, you quickly and politely say
Mrs. Jones, I understand your annoyance at receiving a subscription that you
didn’t want. May I have your address so that I can correct the situation for you?
Chances are that the customer will immediately come back to the point and
provide you with the information you need.
Double-checking all the facts
Upset customers rarely present the facts of their stories in neat little pack-
ages. You may have to do some detective work to make sure that you under-
stand everything they’re telling you. Use the mirroring technique to summarize
your understanding of what the customer says, and then reflect it back to
them. For example, imagine that your customer says
Last Tuesday I received a fax saying the order had been canceled, and then I
got a phone call from your warehouse saying to ignore that fax. Today I still
don’t have the shipment, and nobody seems to know where it is!
To make sure that you understand the situation, you can mirror it back by
saying
What you’re saying is that the order that should have been delivered last
week still hasn’t arrived, and you haven’t been able to find anyone who can
help you. Is that correct?
The customer then has the chance to verify or correct your understanding of
the situation.
Step 5: Mutually agree on the solution
After you gather all the facts, you need to work with your customer to come
up with an acceptable solution to the problem. If you haven’t already discov-
ered what will make him happy, ask. You may, at this point, find it necessary
to take a brief timeout from the customer so that you can do the behind-the-
scenes work necessary to find out if you can actually solve the problem the
way he wants you to. In this case, be sure that the customer knows exactly
why you’re asking him to wait and how long it’ll take for you to get back to
him. Finally, when you both agree on how to resolve the problem, explain the
steps that you’ll take to implement the solution.
Don’t promise what you can’t deliver. Be honest and realistic when telling the
customer what you’ll do. We always recommend that you under-promise and
then over-deliver. Doing so sets an expectation (that you’ll have a good
chance of meeting and, hopefully, exceeding) in the customer’s mind. For
example, if you’re sending a replacement product to the customer and you
know that the shipping process usually takes three days, you can tell her to
233
Chapter 15: Seeing Red: Dealing with Difficult Customers

expect the package within a week. With this action, you build in a little time
for unforeseen delays, and the customer is pleasantly surprised when the
package arrives earlier than she expected.
Step 6: Follow up
You can score big points on the service scoreboard by following up with your
customers — by phone, e-mail, or letter — to check that the solution worked.
If you contact the customer and find out that he isn’t satisfied with the solu-
tion, put out the “buck stops here” sign and continue looking for another,
more workable solution.
Effective follow-up also includes fixing the procedures that are causing the
problem to begin with. By spending time solving internal service delivery
problems, you prevent them from occurring in the future. (For more informa-
tion on how to do this, see Chapter 12.)
Understanding and Overcoming Stress
We read a New York Times article a while ago that highlighted the ten most
stressful professions. Among the top ten listed were police officer, firefighter,
air traffic controller, and customer service representative! Having a job that
requires you to deal with angry, irate, or frustrated customers can make your
blood boil (literally). Even if you aren’t a customer service representative,
some degree of stress is inevitable no matter what job you do (with the possi-
ble exception of sloth groomer at the zoo). Believing that you may find a
stress-free job is wishful thinking. Imagine going into your place of work and
hearing your manager say
As soon as you sense the customer getting angry, just put the phone down.
You have all your work done — why don’t you go home early and relax?
I know it’s Thursday and our deadline is Friday . . . but don’t worry, I can
always hire a few extra hands to help us get it done on time.
I’m giving you a 20-percent raise because you’re doing more than your job
description calls for.
Give it up. You won’t ever hear your manager utter those phrases — not in
this lifetime anyway. So, the answer isn’t to wait for the circumstances of
your job to change. Instead, you have to know how to manage the stress of
dealing with difficult customers before the stress manages you.
234
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Stress is your body’s natural reaction to any demand (physical or psychologi-
cal) that is put upon it. For example, imagine that you arrive at work a little
late one morning and find a note on your desk from your boss. The note says
that he wants to see you in his office. How would you feel? What thoughts
would start running through your mind? Anxious to find out what he wants,
you hurry to his office, but find that he’s out until tomorrow. Now how do you
feel? What are you thinking as you drive home that evening?
The next morning, you rush up to your boss’s office and calmly ask him what
he wanted to see you about. Beaming with pride, he says that he just heard
back from an important client, and he was delighted with the work you put
into his report. Well done!
When we run this scenario by people in our workshops, they usually start
squirming as they visualize the amount of stress their negative thoughts
would be producing. The anticipation and worry that the situation generated
are all imagined, but the stress is very real and can ruin your whole day, not
to mention keep you from getting a good night’s rest.
Understanding how your mind works to create chemical stress in your body
is an important part of both preventing stress before it occurs and curing
stress once it hits.
Identifying the fight or flight mechanism
When physical or psychological demands become extreme, your brain alerts
the hypothalamus gland (located at the base of your brain), which triggers a
complex chain of events known as the fight or flight mechanism. This mecha-
nism puts your body on red alert to gather the strength it needs to meet a
challenging situation. Some of the ways your body prepares itself to meet a
challenge are as follows:
 The heart pumps faster to get more blood to the muscles.
 Breathing speeds up to get more oxygen into the blood stream.
 Muscles tense up in preparation for action.
 Perspiration increases to reduce body temperature.
Recent research has revealed that the hypothalamus gland can trigger the
fight or flight response in situations that are viewed as threatening even
when, in actuality, they’re not. The hypothalamus gland reacts to the signals
your brain sends it without distinguishing between what is real and what is
imagined. In other words, your negative thoughts are powerful enough to
turn on the stress machinery in your body.

Chapter 15: Seeing Red: Dealing with Difficult Customers

The last time Keith was on vacation in Hawaii, he was lying on the beach
looking up at the palm trees and heard, “No, Jack! They can’t do that! They
have a contract with us! That is unacceptable. We’re in this deal to make
money — not friends!” Aroused from his sun-drenched stupor, Keith looked
around to see a man, in shorts and sunglasses, pacing up and down the
beach yelling into a cellular phone. His head looked as if it were about to
explode. He was oblivious to the golden beach, the blue water, and the red
Hibiscus flowers that were in full bloom, and he was totally stressed out by
his internal irritation. Keith suddenly realized that if this guy could create
tension in the middle of such calm circumstances, then it stood to reason
that Keith could also create calm in the midst of tense circumstances.
Changing from stress talk to smart talk
How you talk to yourself about your circumstances can either prevent or acti-
vate your cave dweller, stress-creating response. For example, imagine that
you’ve just been on the phone with a difficult customer who insists that she
get a refund on a product that she purchased from you six months ago. You
sincerely apologize and explain why you can’t offer a refund. The customer
gets upset, interrupts you, and asks to be transferred to your supervisor.
After talking with the customer, your supervisor comes up and tells you that
he bent the rules and okayed a refund.
You now have to decide how you’re going to talk to yourself about this situation.
236
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 
Different mammoth — same response
The fight or flight mechanism has been around
for thousands of years. Our cave-dwelling
ancestors had two basic responses when deal-
ing with a hairy mammoth that was looking for a
human snack: Stay and fight or run like the devil.
This fight or flight response prepared the
caveperson, within seconds, to have the extra
strength needed to carry out either of these
options.
The hairy mammoths of yesterday have been
replaced by the difficult customers and 
deadlines of today, yet our hypothalamus gland 
continues to ignite our body’s reactions in the
same old way. Unlike our ancestors, however,
we don’t usually have the option of fighting or
running away when confronted with an angry
customer (although we’re sure you’ve wanted
to do both). The result is that your body gets all
revved up with nowhere to go. The chemicals
released into your system for extra strength
don’t dissipate and can keep you stressed out
all day long.

Stress talk
If you put too much of a negative spin on the events, you may create stress
talk and end up with your shoulders around your ears. Your stress talk in the
above situation might go something like this:
I can’t believe it! He always undermines my authority! He just doesn’t have
the guts to say “no” to difficult customers! He should support whatever deci-
sion I make. This always happens to me! I can’t win with him! There’s no
point in talking to him about it because he never listens, and it wouldn’t
make any difference anyway . . .
Some of the common themes found in stress talk include the following:
 Exaggeration: Using definitive words like always, never, and won’t usu-
ally blows things out of proportion and exaggerates the incident. Things
you say may feel true but probably aren’t:
He never listens . . .
 Negative labels: Taking a single action or behavior the person has done
and putting a general negative label on it:
He just doesn’t have the guts to say “no” to difficult customers . . .
 Negative outcomes: Expecting the situation you’re in to have a negative
outcome and behaving as if the negative outcome is the only conclusion:
There’s no point in talking to him . . .
 All or nothing attitude: Looking at a situation as black or white or all or
nothing:
He should support any decision I make . . .
 Eliminating the positive: Ignoring all the positive aspects of the situa-
tion and focusing exclusively on the negative ones:
It wouldn’t make any difference . . .
Smart talk
Smart talk is constructive self-talk that helps you create less stress, live longer,
and prosper. Your smart talk in the above situation may go something like this:
I’m really upset, but I know my manager was just trying to keep the cus-
tomer happy. It must have been an awkward position for him to be in. It
would’ve been difficult for me, too. I know that if I talk to him, we can work
out a better way to handle this in the future. Since this doesn’t happen all
the time, there’s no point in getting upset about it.
237
Chapter 15: Seeing Red: Dealing with Difficult Customers

Some of the common themes found in smart talk include the following:
 Assuming good intentions: Taking the point of view that whatever
action the person took, whether it was good or bad, he did it with every-
one’s best intentions in mind:
I know my manager was just trying to keep the customer happy . . .
 Positive outcomes: Expecting the situation you’re in to have a positive
outcome and behaving as if the positive outcome is the only conclusion:
We can work out a better way to handle this in the future . . .
 Focusing on the positive: Seeing the positive aspects of the situation
and including those in your self-talk:
This doesn’t happen all the time . . .
 Seeing shades of gray: Looking objectively at the situation from both
points of view and seeing how each person is right in his or her own way:
It must have been an awkward position for him to be in . . .
 Empathizing: Empathizing with the circumstances the other person is
in, even if you don’t agree with the outcome:
It would’ve been difficult for me, too . . .

Chapter 16
Taking Initiative: Bouncing Back
from Service Blunders
In This Chapter
 Bouncing back from problems to keep your customers happy
 Spreading the goodwill to all from the get-go
S
ervice providers who show you unforgettable customer care are merely
exercising the two kinds of initiatives that are needed to hang on to your
old customers and gain new ones along the way.
We’re talking in this chapter about the initiative needed to bounce back from
those evil customer-service faux pas that plague many businesses and the
simple act of goodwill, a commonsense service initiative that is top-of-the-
line, the gold brand of service that goes beyond merely meeting your cus-
tomers’ expectations to exceeding them.
Taking the Bounce-Back Initiative
How you handle a problem situation with a customer can make the difference
in whether she decides to use your company again. When you make a mis-
take with a customer, bounce-back initiative helps you (and your company)
recover any respect, confidence, or faith that has been lost by your actions.
Situations that require bouncing back often are the result of simple mistakes
or oversights that hurt the customers’ perception of your company. For
example:
 The chef cooks your steak well-done instead of rare, the way you
ordered it.
 Your car isn’t ready by the time the auto shop said it would be.
 You’re assessed a late charge on a bill that you paid on time.
 You have to wait for more than an hour at the doctor’s office.

When these types of incidents happen, the service provider needs to
promptly bounce back by taking three specific steps and getting the cus-
tomer back on his or her side.
Bouncing back in three easy steps
Imagine it’s Monday, and a customer is on the phone screaming at you because
the special order he was supposed to receive Friday still hasn’t arrived. Simple
enough to resolve this problem — you think. You’ll just send his order by over-
night delivery, and the disgruntled customer will have it by Tuesday morning.
Although this action may quickly fix or correct the problem, it doesn’t neces-
sarily convince the customer to stay on your side. He may receive the order
on Tuesday, but what impression will he keep in the back of his mind about
the way your company does business? A fair assumption is that the customer
is relieved to get the package on Tuesday but may be a little wary about any
delivery promises your company makes in the future. That’s why only taking
corrective action is insufficient and doesn’t demonstrate initiative on its own.
240
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 
Satisfying the seemingly satisfied customer
Karen thinks most department stores do a pretty
mediocre job of service these days. Having to
hunt down the clerk, tie him up, and teach him
how to use the cash register isn’t unusual. So
when she gets the kind of service she recently
received, she is blown away!
While shopping at a local mall where the two
main department stores are on either end of the
building, Karen went to the first department
store and immediately found what she was look-
ing for: the perfect belt, in the perfect color, but
wouldn’t you know it, in the wrong size. Karen
asked the salesperson whether the store had
any more of the belts in stock in the back. She
said “no” and added that the only belts like the
one Karen was looking for already were on the
sales floor. Disappointed, Karen turned to leave.
“Wait a minute,” the salesperson said. “Let me
call some of our other stores to find out if they
have that belt in stock.” Karen thought that was
nice of her. She came back a few minutes later
and said she had had no luck locating the belt.
When Karen turned to leave again, the sales-
person said, “Hold on, let me call the buying
office and see whether they can get the belt
from the manufacturer.” Karen thought this offer
was exceptional. Once again, she came back
and said, “No luck.” Finally, Karen turned to
leave, satisfied that this woman had gone
beyond the call of duty and done everything she
could for her. “Don’t leave yet,” she said. “I think
they carry this line of belts across the mall at the
other department store. I’ll go over on my lunch
hour and see if I can find one for you. I’ll call you
later to let you know.” What? Was Karen still on
planet earth? She felt as if she were in the movie
Miracle on 34th Street where Santa Claus sends
the customers from Macy’s to Gimble’s.
Although extreme, this example of initiative
proved to Karen that going out of your way for
the customer creates a powerful and lasting
impression.

You need to complete three key steps to help the disgruntled customer feel
good about doing business with you in the future.
Step 1: Say you’re sorry
Saying you’re sorry is so simple, yet it’s often overlooked. When standing in
front of an upset customer, an apology can calm the fires of wrath. Apologize
even if you’re not the person who made the mistake, because a customer
relates to you as representing the company that messed up.
Don’t be stingy with apologies. Remember that an apology isn’t an automatic
admission of guilt. For example, if you’re talking to a sick friend, you most
likely say how sorry you are. Both of you know that the illness is not your
fault, but you can still be sorry that your friend is having such an unpleasant
experience. Apologizing is a way of letting the customer know that you care
and want to right the wrong.
Some staff members resist the idea of apologizing to customers because they
don’t want to make the company look bad by admitting the mistake. This
thinking is false logic, because customers already believe that you (or the
company) blew it. Denials just agitate them more and make them even
angrier.
Everyone knows that sometimes the customer is downright wrong. But,
really, what difference does it make whether the customer is right or wrong?
Your job as a service provider is to make customers feel valued and impor-
tant and to solve their problems. Too many companies spend too much time
trying to figure out who is at fault — who cares? The solution ultimately
comes down to fixing the problem, not assigning blame.
241
Chapter 16: Taking Initiative: Bouncing Back from Service Blunders
Recovering from two bounce-back problems
Two distinct types of service problems require
bounce-back initiative:
 Predictable problems: Some examples of
predictable problems include running out of
stock, misunderstanding a customer’s
request, and computer or technology
breakdowns. These problems can happen
as long as you’re in business, but to a large
degree, you can plan for them.
 Surprise problems: These problems are
unique to the situation, the client, and your
business. They aren’t predictable and
therefore you can’t really plan for them.
These instances are situations in which the
service provider who uses initiative can
save the day.
One way you can help to encourage members
of your staff to take bounce-back initiative in
your department is to meet with them to discuss
predictable service breakdowns and come up
with plans for how to deal with them.

Step 2: Fix the problem
This step requires you to listen to the customer’s assessment of the problem.
When she explains the situation from her perspective, your job is to fully
absorb what she’s saying about her unique set of circumstances. After you
identify the customer’s problem, the next step obviously is to fix it. Sometimes
you can easily remedy the situation by changing an invoice, redoing an order,
waiving or refunding charges, or replacing a defective product. At other times,
fixing the problem is more complex because the damage or mistake cannot
simply be repaired. In those instances, mutually acceptable compromises need
to be reached. Whatever the problem, this step begins to remedy the situation
and gives the customer what she needs to resolve the source of the conflict.
Don’t waste time and effort by putting the cart before the horse and trying to
fix the wrong problem. Jumping the gun and thinking that you know what the
customer is about to say is an easy trap to fall into, because you think you’ve
heard it all a hundred times before. Doing so, however, loses you ground on
the recovery front and further annoys the customer. More often than not,
what you think the problem is at first glance is different from what it becomes
upon closer examination.
Step 3: Give the customer a care token
Many service providers miss the opportunity to score really big points after
they’ve fixed the problem. They need to take one last, but critical step: giving
the customer a care token. A care token is a specific action that you take as a
way of letting customers know that you consider the mistake you made
(whatever it is) unacceptable, that it won’t happen again, and that you care
about keeping their business. Care tokens say so much, and we’re frankly sur-
prised that companies seem so stingy with them. Here are a few examples of
care tokens that responsible companies can offer:
 An airline gives you a $25 certificate off your next flight, because it
didn’t board enough meals and you were unable to eat (for some people
this problem is a blessing in disguise).
 A restaurant buys you a glass of wine because you don’t like the way
your meal was prepared.
 The garage gives you a loaner car because your car isn’t fixed on time.
 The one-hour photo shop gives you a free roll of film when it takes
longer than an hour to process your holiday snapshots.
 The service provider who gives you her name and direct phone number.
What the care token costs is not important. It certainly doesn’t have to be
expensive, but it does have to show, in a tangible way, that you’re sorry.
242
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Bounce-back initiative is only effective when your basic services are in order
and working. Customers find bounce-back initiative unacceptable when it
replaces competent and expected services.
For example, a new copy shop recently opened near coauthor Keith Bailey’s
office. Modern and full of new, streamlined, state-of-the-art copiers, he just
couldn’t wait to use them. The first time he went over, he waited 45 minutes
to be served because of a shortage of trained staff. They bounced back by
apologizing, explaining the situation, and giving Keith a care-token coupon
that was worth 100 free copies. Okay, he thought, fair enough, they’re new
and getting their act together, no big deal. A week later, Keith went back and
waited 30 minutes for service. They apologized, explained the situation, and
gave him a coupon for 100 free copies. This time Keith was a little less under-
standing. Two weeks later, he went back, and the same thing happened again.
Keith didn’t want another free coupon! The copy shop had bounced back
once too often! Keith’s opinion of its service was so soured that he began
looking for another to have his copies made.
243
Chapter 16: Taking Initiative: Bouncing Back from Service Blunders
What have you done for me lately?
Taking initiative is most effective when it adds
value to the customer experience by going
above and beyond the core services your com-
pany provides. Some airlines, for example, think
that they are giving you great service when they
deliver you to your destination in one piece!
This kind of service is only the ticket into the
game. It isn’t initiative because it’s a fundamen-
tal expectation that all customers have about all
airlines. Therefore, it’s a basic core service.
Core services are not static, and they change
with time. New innovations and ideas that 
your company adopts to show initiative today
eventually are copied by your competitors and
become so widespread that the customer
begins to consider them normal core services
that no longer separate your business from the
crowd. Some examples include:
 Hairdryers and TV remotes in hotel rooms
 Power windows in cars
 Frequent buyer or traveler programs
 800 numbers for catalogs or other mail-
order products
 ATM machines at supermarkets, gas sta-
tions, and so on
Companies that stay on the cutting edge of 
customer service always take a leadership role
by looking for ways to improve their own serv-
ices rather than playing catch-up with their
competitors.

Understanding when to bounce back
Recovering from service blunders and breakdowns is not only about knowing
how to bounce back but also when. Although we can’t tell you every poten-
tial situation in which you may need to bounce back, at least five basic ser-
vice breakdowns for which bounce-back initiative is critical occur when:
 A deadline is missed.
 An order is incorrectly filled.
 The customer is treated rudely or unprofessionally.
 The customer is given incorrect information.
 The customer is unhappy with the product or service.
Recovering from a missed deadline
When you fail to deliver your goods or services by the expected time, the
result is more than likely going to be an upset customer. Situations include:
 Being late for appointments with your customer (and not calling)
 Giving a specific date or window of time for a service to be delivered and
not meeting it
 Promising delivery of a product by a certain date and not meeting the
deadline
 Telling your customer he will be on hold for only a few minutes and
returning to the phone 30 minutes later
 Telling the customer you will call her back tomorrow and not calling
back until the day after tomorrow, if ever
The closer to the agreed upon deadline that you cancel, the more upset your
customer will be. The reverse is also true: The farther away from the deadline
time you cancel, the less upset your customer will be.
For example, if you call at noon to let your customer know that you will be
late for your 4 p.m. appointment, he will react differently than if you call at
3:59 p.m. to tell him you’ll be an hour late.
Fixing an incorrectly filled order
When a customer places an order (for a meal in a restaurant, goods from a mail-
order catalog, and so on) she has a natural and understandable expectation
244
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

to receive exactly what she ordered. If, upon delivery, the customer’s expec-
tations aren’t met, she may be upset because she is
 Disappointed about not receiving what she expected.
 Inconvenienced by having to return the wrong item.
 Forced to waste more time waiting for the correct order to be redelivered.
Changing rude or unprofessional treatment of a customer
The roots of rude or unprofessional treatment of a customer are poor com-
munication and the customer’s negative perception of the way he is treated
by one or more service providers. Some typical situations include:
 Being put on hold abruptly and without any choice in the matter
 Arguing with a customer
 Not returning phone calls
 Accusing a customer of doing something wrong or lying
 Ignoring a customer
Correcting incorrect customer information
Your customers rely on you for accurate information. Even little mistakes can
cause the customer big problems. Imagine the following scenario: You receive
a letter from the IRS stating that your tax return is inaccurate and inconsistent
with its records. The IRS is demanding an explanation with accompanying
paperwork. You call your accountant who says he must look into the matter.
He calls you back and explains that he made a mistake and accidentally omit-
ted an important document from your return. Without bounce-back initiative,
your faith in your accountant may diminish to the point of desertion. As cus-
tomers, we have very little tolerance for inaccuracies from professionals whose
sole job it is to eliminate them. The same is also true of internal customers; 
co-workers expect a consistent level of professionalism and competency from
us. If they don’t receive it, a weak link is created in the customer chain. Other
examples that often require bounce-back initiative are
 Wrong or poor directions on how to reach your place of business
 Mistaken invoicing, billing, and so on
 Incorrect dates or times for specific events
 Incorrect information about company policy or procedure
245
Chapter 16: Taking Initiative: Bouncing Back from Service Blunders

Soothing the unhappy customer
Perception is everything. If, in the customer’s mind, she has been wronged by
your company, it’s up to you to do what you can to fix it. Situations in which a
customer feels wronged may not be fair, but life is tough, and the reality of
your customer service exists only in your customers’ perception of it. If a
customer is unhappy with your product or service, bouncing back works
much better than excuses, reasons, and hard-luck stories.
Bounce-back classics
The following list shows some key ways that you can go the extra mile with
your customer when taking bounce-back initiative.
 Giveaways: Giveaways usually involve, you guessed it, giving away
items, goods, or services that were incorrect or messed up to start with.
 Discounting: Because of a service failure, the company gives a customer
a coupon authorizing a discount (usually anywhere from 10 to 25 per-
cent) on his or her next purchase. This policy helps ensure that the
company will have a repeat customer.
 Absorption of extra costs: When mistakes result in inconvenience to the
customer, any extra cost involved in putting things right as soon as pos-
sible need to be absorbed by your company.
For example, the refund check that the customer was promised by
Tuesday did not arrive, so you offer to send it by overnight courier at no
cost to the customer.
 Personal touch: In this situation, calling works much better than writing
because it’s more immediate and enables you to follow up faster. Calling
a customer after a service breakdown has occurred helps ensure that
the problem has been completely resolved to the customer’s satisfaction
and that no other action is required. This personal touch helps reestab-
lish your company’s credibility while confirming your sincere concern
about the problem being resolved.
Defining Service Heroism: Goodwill
Every once in a while, if you’re lucky, you may have the good fortune of being
on the receiving end of something we call service heroism — the goodwill ini-
tiative. Although the term may evoke images of an overnight delivery courier
pushing through waist-deep snow to deliver a package by 10:30 a.m., in real-
ity service heroism is often one person going out of his or her way to make
the customer’s life easier.
246
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Service heroism has a wow quality to it. When customers experience it, they
say, “Wow!”
On one of Keith’s many visits to the San Francisco airport, he checked in at
the airline club desk. Without realizing it, he left some important documents
on the countertop. Later that evening, he was ripping his luggage open look-
ing for the documents. Of course, they were nowhere to be found. So he did
what he usually does when he’s being resourceful; he called his wife. She
calmly informed him that the airline-club counter agent who had checked
him in had noticed the documents, seen his name on them, looked up his
records in the membership files, and called his home number to let some-
body know that the documents were safe. The agent also confirmed that she
had Keith’s correct address and mailed the documents to him so that he
received them the next day. Wow!
The power of goodwill
At one time or another, you’ve had a service person take initiative and show
such exceptional customer care that you couldn’t wait to tell your friends
and family about it. As customers, you remember the companies that go the
extra mile on your behalf or take the extra step to ensure that you are
delighted with the service you receive.
The difference between good service (which, in our opinion, is not so easy to
find) and “I-can’t-believe-I’m-still-on-this-planet” excellent service is the amount
of goodwill initiative you take. It’s the service person’s willingness and ability
to provide customers with something they can appreciate and don’t expect.
Goodwill initiative is only as good as the goodwill with which it is given.
Going into your local bank and being thrown a free ball point pen by a
grouchy, impolite, and impatient teller just doesn’t cut the mustard, espe-
cially when the message on the barrel of the pen reads: “The bank that
cares.” About what? That’s what we want to know.
We were consulting with a company that had conducted a survey of its cus-
tomers and had received a good rating for the quality of service it provided. A
short while later, the company lost about a third of its customer base to a new
competitor. Confused and concerned about why it had lost so many customers,
the company conducted another survey, but this time lost customers were
queried, and the response the company received was pretty much unanimous:
Your service is good, but your competitor’s is excellent.
The lesson the company learned was that good customer service is not nec-
essarily enough in a tough market. Goodwill initiative helped the newly
arrived competitor elevate its service beyond good to excellent.
247
Chapter 16: Taking Initiative: Bouncing Back from Service Blunders

Develop a goodwill mind-set
Consider these simple acts of goodwill initiative:
 The cab driver who gets out of the taxi and goes around to open the
door for you
 The store clerk who offers to let you use the store’s phone instead of the
pay phone
 The local computer consultant who calls back a week after he sets up
your computer system to make sure that everything is working okay
 The salesman at the car dealership who calls you one month after you
purchase your new car to see whether you need anything
 The hair salon that sends you a greeting card each year on your birthday
 The restaurant that provides free valet parking
 The gas station attendant who washes your windows, even though
you’re in the self-serve lane
 The dry cleaner who puts a little tag on your shirt or blouse informing
you that she has replaced a button or two as part of the store’s compli-
mentary service
All of these examples have one quality in common: They reflect initiative that
is taken out of pure goodwill toward the customer.
The service provider or company isn’t required to take the action. Instead, it
is extra, unasked for, and has a pleasing impact on the customer. Unfortunately,
this type of goodwill is usually reserved for the holidays when you expect to
get free calendars and other giveaways that show a company’s appreciation of
your patronage. Although these efforts are praiseworthy, goodwill initiative has
less of an impact at that time of the year, because they are more common and
therefore more predictable. Goodwill initiative has the most impact when it is
unexpected.

Chapter 17
The Gift of the Gaffe: Dealing 
with Customer Complaints
In This Chapter
 Understanding how customer complaints can improve your service
 Exploring ways to calm angry customers
O
ne of the things that can drive customers to the brink of hysteria (or
more importantly, into a competitor’s arms) is the feeling that they have
no outlet for communicating their frustrations to a company that has, in their
minds, done them wrong.
One study conducted by the Technical Assistance Research Program, Inc.,
(TARP) found that:
 Customers who have a problem with a product or service voice their
objection to the company directly 50 percent of the time. Nine out of ten
of these customers usually take their future business elsewhere.
 Customers who do voice a complaint to the company aren’t thoroughly
satisfied with the company’s effort to resolve the situation 50 percent of
the time. These dissatisfied customers tell, on average, between seven to
nine other people about their unsatisfactory experience with the company.
With statistics like these, which show the relationship between the cus-
tomers’ unhappiness with service and their taking their business elsewhere,
you can’t afford to take the issue of customer complaints lightly. Knowing
how to deal with customer complaints is an essential part of offering excel-
lent customer service.
The eight principles and practices in this chapter help you craft an approach
to dealing with complaints that encourages your customers to communicate
with you and assures them that you’ll take quick and reasonable actions to
resolve their problems and concerns.

Viewing Complaints as Gifts
Even though customer complaints can, at times, be stressful and challenging,
they’re really a gift. If you’re willing to open your mind and listen, complaints
can prove to be a great source of information, innovation, and inspiration.
They can help you do the following:
 Gain valuable ideas for new products or services.
 Recover a customer who may otherwise have decided to go elsewhere.
 Fix problems that could be frustrating to other customers and could
cause them to leave.
 Gain a lifelong customer, if you resolve the complaint quickly and 
efficiently.
 Discover problems that you didn’t know existed.
Don’t think of a complaint as just another problem taking up your time and
energy. Think beyond that and teach yourself, and the rest of your company,
to view customer complaints as valuable opportunities to learn from your
customers and to improve your business.
Make It Easy for Your Customers 
to Complain
The TARP study, which is mentioned earlier, concludes that the three primary
reasons customers fail to register their complaints are
 They believe it isn’t worth their time.
 They don’t know who to complain to.
 They feel that complaining produces no results.
You can minimize the frustration your customers may experience by creating
(and introducing to your customers) a specific company complaint policy
that, in detail, spells out
 How customers can contact you when they have a complaint or problem.
 Where in your organization a customer can make specific complaints.
 Who’s responsible for dealing with different types of complaints.
250
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Remember that the goal is to make communicating with you easy — even if
your customers are only communicating to tell you about problems. Don’t
frustrate, confuse, and annoy your customers by making them chase person
after person, from department to department, to get their complaints resolved.
251
Chapter 17: The Gift of the Gaffe: Dealing with Customer Complaints
Complaints come in all forms
Most complaints your company receives come
in one of four packages: letters, e-mail, face-to-
face contact, and phone calls. An effective
complaint policy takes all complaints seriously
and responds according to the gravity of the
complaint instead of by the method it was
received.
 Letters: Complaint letters are considered by
customers to be an official record of their
grievance. If for no other reason than making
it easy for your customers to send you a
complaint letter, your address should always
be listed clearly on your Web site. The
upside of complaint letters is that they give
you, as the company, the time and opportu-
nity to reflect on the problem, take steps to
resolve it, and get back to the customer with
a response and, hopefully, a resolution.
 E-mail: E-mail has become one of the most
commonly used methods for customer com-
plaints. However, because it still remains a
more informal communication medium,
customers usually use e-mail to voice their
displeasure regarding smaller, less signifi-
cant problems. The downside of e-mail
complaints is that the customer expects
that your company will respond quickly,
usually within 24 to 48 hours. Your company
e-mail policy and procedures should
include quick response times to all e-mail
inquires and complaints received via your
Web site.
 Face-to-face contact: In brick and mortar
businesses such as retail shops, restau-
rants, hotels, and so on, face-to-face com-
munication is the most common form for
customer complaints. These interactions
are often the most challenging for front line
staff since the customer’s emotion is front
and center, not to mention in the service
provider’s face. Off-handed comments,
such as “I always have problems with your
company” or “Could you guys make this any
harder” or “Come on, I don’t have all day”
are general in nature and may not reflect a
particular circumstance, but instead a gen-
eral dissatisfaction. By teaching your
employees to not only apologize when they
hear these types of comments but also to
probe for more details and pass on what
they’re hearing to management, current
problems can be corrected and future prob-
lems prevented.
 Phone calls: Similar to the face-to-face
complaint, phone calls are an immediate
expression of dissatisfaction on the cus-
tomer’s part. Usually complaints made by
phone are less serious than those that
require a letter, but they nonetheless impact
the customer’s experience of doing busi-
ness with your company. Many customers
prefer speaking to a real, live person about
their problem, rather than sending an e-mail
or letter. For this reason, it’s critical to list a
company phone number on your Web site.
Don’t compound an existing problem by
making it difficult for your customers to
locate your phone number. The downside to
phone call complaints is that you must
either solve the problem on the spot, which
isn’t always possible, or call the customer
back, which delays the resolution of the
problem.

Identifying the Elements 
of the Complaint
In order to resolve a customer’s complaint, you need to make sure you under-
stand exactly what’s contributing to the dissatisfaction. Even though this
isn’t the complete list (you’ll find hundreds, if not thousands, of ways that
customers’ expectations aren’t met), the following are the most common ele-
ments found in customer complaints:
 Billing mistakes
 Complicated or confusing product or service instructions
 Delays in delivery of goods or services
 Failure to fulfill product or service warranties
 Failure to provide refunds and adjustments as promised
 Incompetent or discourteous employees
 Incorrect or misleading information
 Misleading advertising
 Misleading statements by sales staff
 Order filled incorrectly
 Poor quality repair work
 Product or service not performing as promised
 Products are back-ordered or unavailable
 Unfriendly user interface
Don’t waste your effort (and your customers’ time) trying to fix the wrong
problem. Assuming that you know what a customer’s problem is within the
first few sentences of the dialogue is easy — you’ve probably heard it all a
hundred times before. Often, however, the problem changes or becomes
unique upon closer examination.
Thanking Your Customers for
Complaining
Most complaining customers don’t expect to be greeted with sincere and
heartfelt appreciation. Yet, a simple thank-you is one way to let your customers
know that you appreciate the time and effort they’ve taken to inform you
about a problem with your company’s service or product.
252
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

In addition to simply expressing thanks for the complaint, let your customers
know why or in what way their complaints have contributed to your busi-
ness. For example, you may want to say
Thanks for your suggestion. It’ll help us improve this process in the future.
Thank you for giving us a chance to resolve the problem and keep you as a
customer.
I appreciate your bringing this to my attention so that we can correct the
problem.
I appreciate your telling me this because it helps me do my job better.
Sincerely Apologizing for All Problems
Nothing extinguishes the fires of wrath like a well-timed, sincere apology.
Simple enough, right? Yet, many workers resist the idea of apologizing to cus-
tomers because they don’t want to make the company or themselves look bad
by admitting a mistake. The problem with this logic is that upset customers
already believe that you (or the company) have made a mistake! Strongly pro-
fessed denials or refusals to apologize just cause more aggravation.
A few guidelines for apologizing to customers include the following:
 Don’t be stingy with apologies. An apology isn’t an automatic admis-
sion of guilt. Instead, it’s a way of letting the customer know that you
care and want to right any wrong that has been done.
 Apologize even if you’re not the person who made the mistake.
Remember that your customer thinks of you as a representative of the
company. She takes your apology as a corporate mea culpa, not a per-
sonal one.
 Apologize even if the customer is wrong. Say something like, “I’m sorry
you’re having a problem.” What difference does it really make if the cus-
tomer is right or wrong? Don’t waste time trying to figure out who’s at
fault in a situation. You need to fix the problem, not assign blame.
 Time your apology carefully. Don’t use your apology as a preemptive
strike by making it the first thing you say to an upset customer. Instead,
give customers time to provide the necessary details so that you can
make your apology more personal and specific to their circumstances.
Fixing the Problem
Fixing your customer’s problem requires an understanding of the elements of
the complaint and of your customer’s unique perspective on the situation.
253
Chapter 17: The Gift of the Gaffe: Dealing with Customer Complaints

After you accurately identify the factual part of a problem and your cus-
tomer’s point of view, the next step, obviously, is to fix it. Often, you can
quickly remedy the situation by changing an invoice, redoing an order, waiv-
ing or refunding charges, or replacing a defective product.
Other times, however, fixing the problem is more complex. The damage or
mistake can’t simply be undone. In these instances, you have to reach mutu-
ally acceptable compromises. Any solution you come up with should take
into account any of the following issues that apply:
 Contractual commitments you’ve made or warranties that may be in
place
 Your customer’s expectations and any promises you’ve made to the 
customer
 The possible cost of all the potential solutions
 The value of this customer to your business and the probability of losing
the customer’s future business
 What a fair and reasonable action to resolve the problem would be
 The chances that the problem will get larger if not fixed immediately
 Your ability to deliver on the chosen solution
You won’t always be able to resolve an issue immediately. In such cases,
offering a realistic time frame for resolution is important. You should explain
why the delay is necessary and what steps you’re taking toward resolution.
Practicing Prevention
The information you gather from customer complaints can provide your com-
pany with a valuable source of process-improvement opportunities. In order
to capture this information and make sure that you’re using it to prevent
future problems from occurring, create a formal procedure for recording all
incoming customer complaints. The information you record should include
 The date of the complaint
 The name of the person who made the complaint
 The nature of the complaint
 Specific details relating to the complaint
 The actions taken to resolve the complaint
 The follow-up contacts made
254
Part IV: Road Blocks: When the Going Gets Rough 

Over time, management or an employee task team can analyze complaint logs
to determine patterns, trends, and root causes of recurring problems. In addi-
tion, complaint logs allow managers to check the system by making sure that
complaints are being handled quickly, fairly, and to the customer’s satisfaction.
Following Up
After you’ve resolved a customer’s complaint, call or e-mail the customer to
bring closure to the situation. This follow-up contact ensures that the prob-
lem has been completely resolved to the customer’s satisfaction and con-
firms that no further action is required. This personal touch also helps
reestablish your company’s credibility while reinforcing your sincere hope
that the problem has been resolved.

In This Chapter

ndustry pundits, Web marketers, and Internet gurus alike agree that after
you develop a strategy for pointing customers to your Web site (see
Chapter 21 for the various ways of optimizing the “findability” of your site or
pick up a copy of Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, by Peter Kent
[Wiley]), getting them to come back more frequently and to stay longer when
they do are keys to success on the Internet. This goal of increasing the over-
all amount of time and attention that visitors give to your site often is
referred to as making your site stickier (think of flies stuck on flypaper). Of
course, the longer and more often your customers spend time on your site,
the better the chances are that they’ll buy something. We agree with most
experts that the key to making your site stickier is focusing on the quantity
and quality of information you provide and the ease with which you enable
visitors to make purchases on your site.
Content: Giving People a 
Reason to Visit Your Site
Given the vast amount of Web sites out there, what can you do to inspire a
Web surfer to spend time (in a sense, develop a relationship) with your site?
One answer is to make sure that you have free, useful, and relevant content.
Remember that the Internet originally was a vehicle for scientists and acade-
mics to freely share ideas, theories, and findings with each other. And

although e-commerce is a growing part of the Web, the culture of the Internet
still values the sharing of information and emphasizes the “for free” aspect of
this sharing. You can add value to your site by featuring many of the useful
forms of content that we discuss in this section.
White papers
Although white papers traditionally refers to reports produced by govern-
ments, today it’s a generic term used to define a five- to ten-page document
that expounds on an industry issue such as: “Making your call center more
profitable” or “The five fallacies of modern management.” By writing a not-too-
detailed essay that provides compelling information you add a valuable reason
for visiting your site. Sites that offer white papers usually headline a descrip-
tive paragraph and then require registration for accessing the complete docu-
ment. White papers target a specific demographic — those interested in your
subject — so while registration is usually free, capturing your visitors’ names
and contact information is invaluable for future marketing follow up.
How-to articles
You can empower your customers by presenting how-to articles that identify
common tasks and offer concrete methods to accomplish them. Including
how-to articles on your Web site does the following:
 Provides value to your customers by giving them relevant and valuable
information in small, bite-sized chunks
 Establishes your company as an expert in its field and, as such,
increases your customers’ comfort level when buying from you
The more up-to-date the content on your site, the better. When you regularly
add to or update the content on your site, your customers come to know you
as a source of consistently current and helpful information. They keep
coming back to see what’s new and improved.
Relevant links and resources
Links on your Web site to other companies or sources of information that
complement your business add value and convenience to your site, and your
customer will recognize that. You can extend the boundaries of your service
260
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

by anticipating what additional products or services your customers are
likely to need and then providing online links to companies that offer those
goods or services. If you’re running a photography Web site, for example, you
may want to include links to photo retailers, photography associations, pho-
tography book links with an online bookseller, and so on.
Make sure that the links you provide direct your customers to sites you know
and trust. Customers commonly view links as endorsements.
Online tools
The content on your site isn’t limited to passive print; you can also provide
your visitors with an online tool as part of the content offering. Examples
include
 Questionnaires
 Surveys
 Tests
 Industry-specific calculators (for example, a Web tool that calculates
mortgage payments)
 Real-time stock quotes
 Syndicated news
You can check out an online tool by logging on to our Web site at www.scg
training.com. Just click on “Quality Service Audit” and take an interactive
audit that evaluates how customer-focused your organization is and then,
based on your score, provides recommended actions.
Advice
If your company has a particular area of expertise or specific information you
want to share with your customers, try adding an advice section to your site.
Having advice on your site can be as simple as offering a FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) section, where you post and answer typical questions a 
visitor may have. FAQ pages can be frustrating if the visitor doesn’t find the
answer they’re looking for, so by necessity the section must also offer an
email address for posting such questions, along with a specific time frame by
when the question will be answered.
261
Chapter 18: Clicking with Your Customers: Online Content and Commerce

E-mail newsletter
One of the best ways to provide valuable information to your customers and,
at the same time, promote the commerce side of your business is to create an
e-mail newsletter. Among other things, the newsletter can include
 Feature stories about your customers and how they use your products
and services
 How-to articles written by your company’s employees and designed to
empower newsletter recipients
 Articles by guest writers on topics relevant to your business, its prod-
ucts, and your customers’ interests. (You can create an arrangement in
which writers contribute to your newsletter in exchange for your listing
their Web addresses.)
Make sure that you archive all your past newsletters on your site; someone’s
bound to want to read them. Set up a system by which visitors can search
previous newsletters using keywords to find what they’re looking for.
Live interview or Web-cast event
A great way to attract people to your site and provide them with interesting
and useful information is to offer a live interview, which is the equivalent of a
text-based Q&A session presented in real time. Your Web site plays host to
the interview, which is set for a specific date and time and features a guest
who is of interest to your audience. A moderator facilitates questions from
the online audience.
Alternatively, you can offer a Web-cast event, which is more like a live lecture.
Web casts are set up much like a live interview, but they have the added fea-
tures of audio and/or video and often are accompanied by synchronized
PowerPoint slide presentations. Interviews and Web casts can be presented
either live or prerecorded and made available on demand.
Commerce: Making It Easy 
for Your Customers to Buy
The obvious first step toward e-commerce glory is getting your product
ready to sell and your technology up and running so that you enable cus-
tomers to buy from you. Although numerous issues are related to conducting
commerce on your Web site, we’ve discovered that the nine items presented
262
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

in this section form a good foundation for providing your customers with the
confidence needed to make purchases from your company. Just follow our
advice in this section, and you’ll be far ahead of many e-commerce sites.
Make it safe
Even simple e-commerce transactions require buyers to provide a great deal
of personal information, including their name, address, phone number, and
billing data. Naturally, many consumers are a bit leery about giving this infor-
mation over the Internet. You can go a long way toward making your cus-
tomers feel safe in purchasing from you by:
 Using credit-card data encryption
 Maintaining all customer-provided data as confidential (in other words,
not selling it!)
 Giving customers the choice of keeping their credit-card data on file at
your site — or not
Make it convenient
If your purchasing processes aren’t quick and easy, you run the risk of not
only losing the sale, but potentially losing the customer.
Make your purchase processes as easy as possible by:
 Asking your customers to provide you with only the data that’s needed
to fill their order
 Not making customers enter the same information into the system more
than once
 Allowing your customers a means of easily updating their information on
your system, a feature that can save customers significant hassle on
subsequent visits to your site
After you collect your customer’s information, make sure you remember who
each one is the next time any of them visit your site. A couple of good exam-
ples of this technology are my.yahoo.com and Amazon.com.
Confirm order status
When customers place orders over the Internet, they expect an immediate con-
firmation, either at the end of the order process itself or by e-mail immediately
263
Chapter 18: Clicking with Your Customers: Online Content and Commerce

afterward. To avoid confusion, mistakes, and problems down the line, order
confirmations need to include
 A list of the items that were ordered
 The total cost of the order, including shipping and handling
 The address to which the order will be delivered
 The date the order will be shipped (if backordered, the expected date of
shipment)
 Tracking information (usually via a link to the shipper’s Web site)
If a customer orders a product that has a long lead time or is backordered,
e-mailing her weekly updates to keep her apprised of the situation is a good
idea. Alternatively, you can provide your customers with a Web link to check
the status of their own orders.
Make suggestions
Internet customers have come to expect Web sites to suggest products and
services that may be of interest to them based upon their specific buying pat-
terns. For example, Amazon.com offers its customers a section under each
book listing called “Customers who bought this book also bought.” It lists other,
related books the customer may want to purchase. This type of suggestive sell-
ing is ideally suited for the Web because it gives customers information about
what’s available, yet allows them to choose whether to click through.
Offer financial incentives
Consider the success of warehouse and outlet stores in general. Everyone
loves a bargain! One strategy for encouraging customers to buy from you
online is to offer a variety of financial incentives that are available through pur-
chase only via your Web site. You’ll need to experiment to find out which ones
work best for your type of business. Some of the incentives to try include
 Lowering online prices. Offer your online customers a lower price than
they’d get when purchasing through one of your other distribution chan-
nels (phone order, mail-order, or retail). You may want to explain to cus-
tomers that when they order online, your costs are reduced, and you’re
able to pass those savings along to the customer in the form of lower
prices.
 Limiting the offer time. Send an e-mail notification to your customer list
alerting customers to a special, limited-time offer. Advertise it on your
264
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

home page, too. The offer can be a “special of the week,” a coupon good
for a certain amount off of the customer’s next purchase, a gift with pur-
chase, or free shipping and handling. The key to this incentive is to be
absolutely clear that the offer is valid for a limited time only.
 Establishing a bonus program. A bonus program is based on the idea
that every time a customer makes a purchase from you, she racks up
points toward a future discount, free merchandise, or a bonus gift. To
encourage participation, offer free bonus points just for signing up. After
your customers establish an account, they’re more likely to come to
your site and buy your products.
List recent projects
You can help your customers determine whether your business has what
they need and want by posting a “Recent Projects” section on your Web site.
The aim of this section is to demonstrate your company’s capabilities to
potential clients. This section needs to list three to six of your past projects
in chronological order. Make each project description no more than a para-
graph and include the following elements:
 Client name or type of company
 Dates of the project
 General project description
 Results of project
A sample paragraph may look like this:
April, 2006: We worked with a large national bank to design and implement
a customer-relations training program for all 40,000 of its staff and man-
agers. The program focused on teaching day-to-day customer-relations skills
that the employees could use with customers face to face, over e-mail, and
on the phone. Topics included: Dealing with difficult customers, creating rap-
port via e-mail, team-oriented problem solving, etc. The coordinating man-
agement program helped managers understand how to create a day-to-day
environment for service excellence with a focus on creating a specific plan
for improving service within their work areas. Evaluations of the program
averaged 4.5 on a 5.0 scale.
Get permission to use your client’s name in association with a particular 
project before posting it as part of a Recent Projects or other online reference
tool. If doing so proves too difficult, you can substitute a general reference to
your client’s type of business, size, or industry category for the actual com-
pany name.
265
Chapter 18: Clicking with Your Customers: Online Content and Commerce

Post testimonials
Nothing is more powerful than a well-placed quote from a satisfied client.
Give visitors to your site the option of clicking onto a page or two of testimo-
nials from current and past clients. Knowing what other customers say about
you helps to influence a potential buyer’s decision to purchase from you.
Testimonials need to be short and sweet — no more than three to four 
sentences — and must be attributed to the name, company, and title of the
person giving the quote. As always, get permission before posting the quote
on your Web site.
Provide customer lists
Although you don’t need to include a complete list of every customer you
have ever had, a customer list can inspire confidence in potential buyers
whenever they see that others in their industry or well-known companies
have made purchases from you. You can arrange your customer lists alpha-
betically or by industry, depending on what best suits your type of business.
You may actually want to give visitors to your Web site some sorting options
(alphabetically, by industry, by size, and so on), so they can check you out
according to their preferences.
Always make sure that you have permission from your customers before
adding them to your online customer list.
Show samples of your work
If possible, showcase a sample of your work on your Web site. By all means,
toot your own horn! For example:
 If you’re a photographer, try posting a stunning example of your work.
 If you’re a public speaker, use streaming video and audio of you deliver-
ing a speech.
 If you’re a creative writer, provide a sample of your writing.
 If you’re a building contractor, display photos of completed projects
(maybe before and after shots).
 If you’re a Web developer, post a link to a Web site you’ve designed.
 If you’re a landscape architect, show a rendering of a landscape plan
you’ve designed.
266
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

If your business has recently won an award or been the subject of positive
publicity, post that information on your Web site. Anything that makes your
company appear more competent, trustworthy, and knowledgeable in a cus-
tomer’s eyes is worth putting on your Web site.
Encouraging People to Share 
Ideas about Your Company
Think of the last trip you made to a mall near your home on a sunny day. You
probably were browsing for the perfect gift for a friend, communing with your
fellow citizens, and sipping a Starbucks coffee — ahhhh . . . all was right with
the world.
Okay, perhaps we’ve gone a bit too far. But the point is that today’s mall is
more than just a collection of stores selling everything from shoes to stereo
systems. The shopping mall has become an icon of interactivity, a place for
us to meet and greet others in our community. In the online world, your Web
site has the potential of becoming an electronic community, a gathering place
your customers will want to visit again and again.
Consider the success of America Online, which started out as a service
provider of value-added information and only brought online shopping into
the picture later, after it had a strong community of users already in place.
The bottom line is that the greater the sense of community you can create on
your site and the more you can tailor your offerings to a specific topic,
lifestyle, age, or social group, the stronger the customer relationships you
will be able to establish with your visitors.
Although you may find the idea of adding community features to your site
overwhelming, in reality all it takes is utilizing just a few relatively simple
tools.
Message boards
Also called forums or bulletin boards, message boards enable your visitors to
post and reply to messages on various topics. Thus large numbers of your
visitors can have conversations that take place over a period of time (days,
weeks, months, or longer). One of the advantages of this type of community
activity is that people don’t have to be online at the same time to interact
with one another.
267
Chapter 18: Clicking with Your Customers: Online Content and Commerce

Putting a message board on your Web site also presents you with an opportu-
nity to understand how your customers perceive your company. By reviewing
the content of these discussions, which remain posted on the board, you can
find out a great deal about your visitors’ interests and concerns. This infor-
mation helps you identify significant issues and pass useful knowledge on to
your customer base.
Blogs
A blog (short for Weblog) is a personal journal that expresses the opinions
and ideas of the author or blogger. Usually a blog hosted on a Web site sup-
ports and reflects the purpose of the Web site. There are blogs on every sub-
ject you can imagine, from pets to politics, and the blogging pages of a Web
site are created with a user-friendly interface so that typing in new entries is
easy and requires no technical expertise. The interactive aspect of blogging
invites site visitors to add their comments and opinions so that in-depth dis-
cussions can go on for days or weeks, with the blogs being updated daily.
Blogs add a dynamic element to a Web site because they foster a virtual com-
munity of people who are interested in similar issues.
Broadcast e-mail lists
The simplest of all community-building methods, e-mail lists (formerly called
LISTSERVES) are similar to traditional mailing lists in that your correspon-
dences are sent simultaneously to everyone on your list — but they require
no postage or printing. You can encourage users who have subscribed to
your e-mail list to visit your Web site by sending regular information about
what your company is doing, special offers, or any other information your
customers may find valuable. Unlike open e-mail lists where anyone can post
a message, broadcast e-mail lists are one way, and only the host company pub-
lishes and sends the e-mails.

T
he nature of your customers’ online interactions with your company
plays an important role in the overall success of your site, the reputation
of your company, and the strength of your online brand. If your online cus-
tomer finds herself confused and frustrated, you’ve undercut all your other
efforts. Underneath the jazzy graphics, clever URL (that’s your Web site
address that usually begins with www), and marketing hype lies the crux of
the matter: You’re not just creating a Web site, you’re creating a customer
experience.
If you’re anything like us, you may have good ideas about what your site
should look and feel like, but you have no idea how to actually produce it.
What you need is a Web developer. Web developers are those brave souls
who spend each day in the depths of digital design and who produce Web
sites that are (we hope) user-friendly from aesthetic and technical points of
view. In short, your Web developer can make your online presence magical.
However, if you’re not careful when choosing a Web developer, he can make
your presence much less than desirable.
In this chapter we walk you through three key steps to finding the right Web
developer for your company — someone who fits with your company culture,
can provide the expertise you need, and is able to work within your budget.
We also provide you with tips for how to outshine your competitors’ Web
sites. Finally, after all that hard work, you want to make sure that people actu-
ally find your site, so we give you some pointers for doing just that.

Determining Your Web Site Goals
Before you log on to the Internet, begin thumbing through the yellow pages or
call your local graphic design firm to look for potential Web developers. Also,
spend some time thinking about what you specifically want to achieve with
your site. Some questions you may want to ask yourself include the following:
 What is the purpose of this Web site?
 Who is the target audience for this site?
 What are the long-term goals for this site?
 What are the short-term goals for this site?
 What is the scope of this particular project?
The more specific the information is that you provide a Web developer, the
more accurate an estimate the developer can give you of the time and cost
involved in achieving your site goals. Beyond determining what your main
objective is, you should be prepared to answer these questions before you
speak with a Web developer:
 Do you already have a domain name or do you need to register one?
 What specific products or services will be sold on the site?
 Who do you have in mind to host the site?
 How do you plan to maintain and update the site?
 Do you have company literature that can be used on the site?
 How sophisticated a design do you want for the site? (For example, do
you want text, animation, audio, or video, or a combination of them all?)
 Are you planning to include interactive features, such as feedback and
response forms?
 What special technologies will you need to meet your goals? (For exam-
ple, shopping carts, databases, or animation?)
 What is your budget for site creation, maintenance, and marketing?
 Are you planning to accept payments over the site?
To stay within your budget and avoid any financial surprises we strongly rec-
ommend sketching out a site map. By planning ahead and estimating the
overall number of pages your site needs, you’ll create a flowchart that repre-
sents the structure of your site by showing the main content categories and
subcategories you plan to include. Planning the details and having a grasp on
how the pages relate to one another will save frustration, time, and money.

Exploring Ways to Reach Your Goals
Now that you know what your site goals are, before sitting down to interview
potential Web developers, you need to decide how you want to divide up the
work of the project. For example:
 What aspects do you want to hire a Web developer to handle? For exam-
ple they can secure your Web site name; manage the overall site devel-
opment; perform regular updates of Web content, and so on.
 What parts of the project will go to other vendors such as graphic
artists who might design your logo; develop the overall look and feel of
each page; copywriters who take your ideas and create compelling copy,
or simply spruce up your written material or they may edit contribu-
tions that you gather from other sources such as other publications,
professional organizations and so on.
 What role do you want your existing staff to play? For example you
might ask your staff to collect customer testimonials that you publish on
your site, or contribute how-to articles or submit a list of the FAQs
(Frequently Asked Questions) that they receive from customers.
Using specialists for each part of your Web design will rack up the costs of
development. If you don’t want to overtax your budget, consider limiting the
number of pages and finding a Web developer that shows skill in both techni-
cal and design abilities.
A Web developer can contribute to your site development project by doing
the following:
 Setting up all the technology necessary to achieve your site goals.
 Designing, implementing, and maintaining all aspects of your site.
 Advising you on ways to implement plans you’ve already begun to draft.
 Converting materials, such as brochures, product descriptions, and testi-
monials, to HTML (or, for those who really want to know, Hypertext Markup
Language, which is the programming language used on the Web).
 Creating an overall graphic style that represents your business. Or, a
developer can transfer your established graphic image to your new Web
environment.
Print designers who have limited experience with Web development often make
the mistake of thinking that anything they produce in print will easily translate
to the Web. They don’t realize the limitations of the HTML environment.
271
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

For this reason, it’s a good idea to hire a graphic designer for general direc-
tion, but then supplement that person with a Web designer. Working together,
the graphic designer and the Web designer should
 Develop graphics that are bandwidth friendly.
 Create interfaces that are user friendly.
 Design layouts that recognize HTML limitations.
Engaging the Right Web Developer
You know your objectives, you have a budget in place, and you have the
thumbs up from management. It’s finally time to take the big leap and hire a
Web site developer. What now? The questions race through your frenzied
brain, which was stimulated by that triple espresso you downed at lunch.
Where do I find a Web site developer? How much will it cost to develop my
site? How can I make sure they’ll do a good job? The questions go on and on.
Unfortunately, many companies don’t put the same care, concern, and atten-
tion to detail into choosing a Web developer that they would into hiring a
graphic designer to create their annual report or an accountant to handle
their books. To make matters even more complex, the job description of a
Web developer is constantly evolving. This uncertainty makes determining
who they should hire to develop their site even more difficult for the average
businessperson.
The job of putting together a Web site is complex and involves a variety of
skills. For this reason, Web developers often have a group of other experts
available to work for them either as employees or on a subcontract basis. To
avoid having to find and hire a separate contributors, look for a Web develop-
ment firm that has working relationships with graphic designers, HTML pro-
grammers, database programmers, and others who can work together to
form a Web development team that can get your job done with the quality
you expect.
If you’re looking to develop a site that is relatively simple and small, you can
probably find all the capabilities you need in a solo practitioner, which is a
person who can develop your site without a large support team and has a
decent skill level in the full spectrum of technical and artistic requirements. If
your site is going to be mid-sized and offer more bells and whistles, a small
Web shop (a company whose business is creating Web sites) can, more than
likely, take care of your needs. In general, the advantage of a hiring a solo
practitioner or a small Web shop is that your site gets developed by the
272
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

people you spoke with when you were making the decision of who to hire.
Solo practitioners, after all, can’t really delegate the job to someone else!
If you’re looking to develop a large and highly complex site that uses leading-
edge technology, you may need to hire a major Web development firm. The
advantage of hiring a large firm is that it employs large numbers of highly-
specialized staff members who are available to work on your site.
Regardless of which way you decide to go, certain criteria exist that you can
use to evaluate potential Web developers, whether they are solo practition-
ers, small Web shops, or large Web development firms. The following sec-
tions pave your way to finding the perfect Web developer for your company.
Technical competence
Ask the developers to describe specific projects they’ve worked on that
incorporate the type of technology you expect to use in your site. For exam-
ple, if your site is going to be animation heavy, take a look at Web sites that
the developers have already created to make sure that they’ve had prior
experience incorporating animation that has the quality you expect. Other
technological issues to look for on sites that the developers have created
include the following:
 Clear site navigation
 Innovative storytelling
 Appropriate mix of media (audio, video, text, and so on)
In today’s rapidly-changing business environment, technical competence
requires constant updating. Be sure to ask the Web developers what kinds of
continuing education they participate in. They should have some method 
to stay on top of the latest technological bells and whistles in Web site 
development.
Creative style
In general, you should feel that the sites the developer has created previously
are attractive and are to your taste, in terms of overall look and graphics. Ask
the developer to provide you with a few sites it has created so that you can
review them for overall design quality. If you don’t see design concepts that
you like, chances are you have incompatible design tastes. Move on and find
another developer.
273
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

Ongoing maintenance capabilities
One of the biggest complaints clients have about working with Web develop-
ers is that, after the site is up and running, getting the developer to promptly
make changes is difficult. One reason for this difficulty is that some develop-
ers are strictly in the business of creating the initial site and aren’t interested
in or capable of offering ongoing maintenance. Although hiring one company
to do the site development and another to do the maintenance is a perfectly
acceptable and common alternative, you want to know beforehand where
you stand, in terms of maintenance, with the particular Web developer.
Communicating in advance insures that expectations are clear and prevents
future problems and frustrations.
Communication skills
Because they’ve focused most of their attention on honing their technical
expertise, many people who develop sites are a whiz at programming — but
are weak in their interpersonal communication skills. Since the Web devel-
oper needs to work hand in hand with you and others, pay attention to how
the person communicates in the interview stage. In addition, you may want
to call the developer’s references and inquire about the following:
 Was the person’s general manner helpful and customer-focused?
 Was the person cooperative in working with others?
 Did he provide periodic updates on the project’s progress?
 Did he communicate when a problem occurred?
 Did he let you know if he was going to miss a deadline?
Professional conduct
Because a Web developer is often made privy to the most intimate aspects of
your business, including client lists, pricing structure, marketing strategies,
and so on, you need to feel confident that the developer does the following:
 Keeps the details of your business confidential.
 Avoids putting herself in a position where a conflict of interest between
you and any of her other clients exists.
Many firms ask the Web developer to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
Speaking with the Web developer and specifically asking her to tell you if
she’s currently working with, or has immediate plans to work with, any client
where a conflict of interests may exist with your business is a good idea. Dealing
with these issues upfront is an important step in establishing a professional
274
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

relationship with the Web developer. It also helps prevent misunderstandings
and problems farther down the line.
For the protection of all the parties involved, always get a contract — in writ-
ing — prior to the beginning of work. It doesn’t matter how great the rapport
is between you and your developer. Having a contract protects the developer
and ensures that you get what you pay for. Among other items, the contract
should spell out the project scope, technologies to be used, deadlines, fee
arrangements, and payment schedules. You can find generic or boilerplate
contracts that will probably fit your needs in Business Contracts Kit For
Dummies, by Richard D. Harroch (Wiley).
References and credentials
One of the great things about the Internet is that it’s given birth to an array of
new jobs, including the Web developer. The downside of this boom is that vir-
tually anyone, regardless of their background or qualifications, can hang a sign
outside his door to declare himself a Web designer. For example, a graphic
artist who may be great at designing print brochures, but who may have no
technical knowledge on implementing an e-commerce site, can still declare
himself a Web developer! Likewise, a technical-type person with outstanding
programming skills may decide to go into the Web development business even
though he has no sense of how color and design should be used.
Checking the credentials and references of any potential Web developer is
critically important to ensure that the person you hire has the skills neces-
sary to complete the job to your satisfaction. Some issues to consider when
considering a developer include the following:
 Has the developer done this type of Web site before? Is this person
qualified, given the goals of your project and the various services you
need (including graphics, writing, and technology)? Ask the Web devel-
oper to provide you with examples of Web sites (and the addresses) she
has designed that are similar to the type of site you’re looking to create.
 Does this person have any industry or software certifications? Even
though being certified doesn’t guarantee that the Web developer is able
to get the job done, certification is a good place to start in evaluating the
person’s knowledge base. However, keep in mind that many top-of-the-
line Web developers have no certification, but still deliver a high-quality
job based on their practical experience and the knowledge gained from
self-education.
 How long has the developer been in the business? The more experi-
ence a developer has, the more professional, effective, and unique your
Web site will be. Look for someone who has a minimum of three to five
years of Web development experience. Remember that the fewer years
of experience a developer has, the more likely she will be to use tem-
plates from an off-the-shelf program. Even though a novice developer
may only cost you a few hundred dollars, she could leave you with a
mediocre site that could cost you thousands of dollars in lost business.
275
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

 What do the developer’s references have to say about her? As old
fashioned as it may seem, one of the best ways to determine the credibil-
ity of a Web developer is to call a few of her clients and ask how their
project went. Getting the information straight from the horse’s mouth
can be invaluable. Don’t limit your questions to the person’s technical
capabilities. To get the big picture, focus your questions on the creative
and interpersonal aspects of the reference-giver’s relationship with the
developer. Consider asking the following questions:
• How easy was it to do business with the developer?
• Did she take a collaborative approach or was she very opinionated
and difficult to deal with?
• How well did she follow through on what she promised?
• Did she get work done on time?
A good source of information on Web developers is the International
Webmasters Association (www.iwanet.org). Among other services, it offers
referrals to resources in your area, certification programs, and up-to-date
information and developments in the field of Web development.
Polishing Your Web Site to 
Outshine Your Competitors
Your Web developer (or you, if you are technically inclined) should know
how to polish your site so that it outshines the competitors. The following
sections show the many ways to ensure that your site is pleasing to your
potential (and current) customers.
Make site navigation easy
To search any Web site effectively, a customer needs to use a navigation
system, a clearly labeled set of buttons that directs them to different parts of
the particular Web site they’re exploring. The navigation system you and
your Web developer establish for your company’s Web site is what enables
your customers to find the information they’re looking for. On the other
hand, a poor navigation system may only frustrate the customers in their
attempts to find that information.
Because you want your site to be as customer-friendly as possible, you need
to make exploring the various pages on your Web site as easy as possible.
Creative and original design, although aesthetically valuable, is less important
276
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

than organizing your site in a way that enables visitors to find their way
around quickly and easily.
When designing a navigation system for your site, make sure that the site
architecture answers more questions than it raises. If you and your Web
developer don’t create clear and easy-to-use site navigation, most visitors
will become frustrated and leave. Here are some factors to consider when
evaluating your existing site design or deciding on the method that cus-
tomers will use when navigating a new site:
 Provide visual feedback so users know where they are. If you highlight
and reinforce your site’s section names so that users who come to your
site know exactly what section of the site they’re currently exploring,
you greatly improve your site’s accessibility.
 Make the site’s section names easy to understand. Because the goal is
to make navigating through your site a no-brainer, logical names are
more important than cleverness.
 Keep navigation buttons consistent from page to page. Presenting the
same navigation system on every page increases your customers’ com-
fort. Consistency and repetition in the navigation elements prevents
your customers from having to search for the buttons on each page.
 Make site navigation self-explanatory. The best navigation systems
require no thought. For example, the “Products” button takes you to a
page that describes the company’s products, and the “Company
Information” button takes you to information about the company. Ask
yourself whether a typical 10-year-old could easily navigate the site. If
not, the navigation system is probably too complicated.
 Use a variety of navigation elements. Simple links, graphic icons, navi-
gation buttons, fancy graphics, photos, and plain old text can all be used
in navigating a site. Use a combination of these elements so that your
customers can go to any section of the site they’re interested in and
easily find their way back to the home page.
 Group together the navigation buttons that lead to the main parts of
your site. Site navigation buttons that send the customer to the main
parts of your page should be grouped together. Don’t spread them all
over the page. They can be placed either at the top, bottom, or side of
the page, as long as they’re together. In general, finding these buttons is
easiest if they’re placed vertically on the left side of the page.
 Give customers a textual description of what the links on your site
provide. Placing a short sentence underneath each link makes finding
what they want easy for the customers because they understand what
pages the links connect to.
277
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

Answer their questions 
before they even ask
After so many years in business, you know the questions that your customers
or potential customers are most likely to ask. Create a Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) section on your Web site that clearly states, then answers,
these questions.
If you include a FAQ section, it’s a good idea to have an e-mail link on the
same page for those people who can’t find an answer to their question. The
link opens up an e-mail page that allows the customer to write to you with his
problem and get an answer back. The e-mail link reduces some of the frustra-
tion customers feel when they can’t find what they want.
Hit a home run with your home page
Have you ever visited a Web site and, after a few minutes of looking around,
realized that you had no idea what the heck the site was about? The number
of sites, especially those of small- and medium-sized businesses, that leave
visitors scratching their heads and wondering, “What do these people do?” is
amazing — even though a mystifying site is a clear violation of all the rules
you learned in Business 101. Make sure that your home page clearly states
the business you’re in and the types of products and services you offer. Within
a few seconds, your visitor should know exactly what your site is about and
should have received the main message that you’re trying to get across.
Offer something for free
“Free” is one of the words that has defined the culture of the Internet from
the beginning. Even though the Internet is a hotbed of commercial activity,
the attraction of going to a site and finding something for free is still deeply
ingrained in the online culture and a big part of what brings visitors to 
your site.
One of the best and most popular giveaways you can offer is relevant, clear,
and useful information in the form of white papers, articles, and company
newsletters. Your strategy for service on the Internet should include offering
enough information and services for free that you become a bookmark desti-
nation for your current and potential customers.

Make your downloads fast
Look around at the hurried pace of today’s business world and you’ll see that
your customers have neither the time nor the patience to wait for anything —
not in line at the bank, on hold on the phone, or for the Web pages on your
site to download. Consider these facts:
 The majority of Web pages take anywhere from 3 to 11 seconds to 
download.
 The average viewer will click off a site if a page takes more than eight
seconds to download.
 These click-offs (bailouts when users get tired of waiting and click away
from a slow Web page) cost e-businesses an estimated $4.35 billion
annually in lost revenue.
Speed does make a difference. You can reduce your customer bailout rate
from 30 percent to 8 percent just by reducing your download time by one
second per page! Remember that if your site is slow, your customers will go.
To decrease the download time of your pages, avoid over-designing the site
with too many fancy graphics. In general, photos and graphics with large file
sizes take a long time to download.
Begin with high-quality, professional photos, and instead of simply scanning
them, try using a photo-editing software program, such as Adobe Photoshop,
to compress the image so that the file size is small enough to load quickly. Be
aware that compression may reduce the quality of the image somewhat. We
suggest using a professional Web page designer who can help you strike the
delicate balance between speed and quality.
Offer contact options
Many of the business owners and executives who attend our seminars have
told us that customers often see something on their company’s Web site that
they’re interested in, and then want to contact the company to ask a question
or to place an order. The philosophy, “Do business with your customers the
way they want to do business with you,” is one of the principles behind excel-
lent service. In other words, you need to make sure that your Web site has an
easy to find “Contact Us” link on the home page. Because some customers
won’t be accessing your site through the front door, you may want to post
your contact information on all the pages within your site.
279
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

Many companies provide too little detailed contact information, limit the con-
tact information to only an e-mail address, or provide no contact information
at all. Your contact section should provide all the possible options for contact-
ing your company, including phone number, street address, fax, and e-mail.
Don’t limit your customers to one method of contacting you, such as e-mail.
Instead of only one method, give customers all the options and let them
choose how they want to contact you. Providing a variety of contact options
makes you look more like an established business and less like a fly-by-night
company. Providing multiple contact options makes it look like you actually
want customers to contact you and reflects your company’s dedication to
excellent customer service
Use multiple media
Imagine receiving a brochure from two different companies on the same day.
One is all text, and the other is a combination of words and images. Which
would seem more interesting to you? Create a more dynamic and interactive
online experience for your customers by using animation, video, and audio
files to enhance the text on your Web site.
As the saying goes, “A picture paints a thousand words.” In the online world,
pictures can give your customers a feel for who you are and the kind of busi-
ness you’re in. Think about what types of pictures you could put on your site
that would help your customers get a better understanding of your business.
You could include a picture of yourself, your entire team, or your products.
Video and audio clips are two effective ways to introduce yourself and your
company to your customers. These clips give customers a taste of what
you’re offering and add value to your site. However, be careful that these
video and audio files don’t take too long to load. You could also include an
interactive media tool, such as a self-scoring questionnaire, to provide value
to your customers by helping them evaluate some aspect of their business or
to identify a business need (that your business could fulfill) in some relevant
way. For example, a flooring manufacturer might win customers by providing
questions that ask them where they plan to use the flooring, the amount of
traffic it will get, and so on and then use the answers they enter to direct
them to the floor covering it carries that is most suitable for their needs.
Update your site often
After their Web sites are up and running, business owners too often sit down,
put their feet up on their desks, wipe their brows, and exclaim with relief,
280
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

“Whew, I’m glad that’s done!” Unfortunately, getting your Web site up and run-
ning is just the beginning of the process of maintaining quality online service. If
you want your customers to consider your site a valuable destination, you have
to make constant updates.
Visitors are always looking for fresh and new information. In addition to the
basics, such as updating your contact information if it changes, removing
time-sensitive material, and updating current specials, you can create a
“What’s New” section and update it daily, weekly, or monthly, as appropriate.
Keep your site design simple and clean
Hundreds of books, magazine articles, and Web sites have addressed the seri-
ous business of Web site design. Unfortunately, many businesses don’t seem
to be paying attention to this important concept. In their attempts to be
unique and to use cutting-edge technology, they’ve created Web site design
disasters by jamming their sites full of:
 Busy backgrounds
 Hard-to-read fonts
 Too many buttons
 Jumping, twirling, and spinning animations
Resist the temptation to clutter up your Web site. If you opt for a simple and
clean layout, you’ll have a Web site that’s well designed, interesting, and cus-
tomer focused. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:
 Although one well-placed banner (those little commercial billboards you
see on so many Web sites) isn’t hard on the eyes, imagine a Web page
that has three banners, four Amazon buttons, and a variety of links all
competing for attention. You risk making your site look busy, confusing,
and unprofessional when you include too many of these banners.
 A nice, clean background on your site makes text easier to read, looks
more professional, and is less distracting than a busy background with
some wild pattern that reminds browsers of the bathroom wallpaper they
grew up looking at. When choosing your site background, stick with a basic
color that’s consistent with the image you want your company to portray.
 Graphics make a site visually appealing but, if overused, can leave a
poor impression. Remember that your customers (and potential cus-
tomers) don’t like to wait for graphics to download. Make sure that any
graphics are compressed enough to download quickly.
281
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

Practice e-mail excellence
Most of the e-mails you send to customers will probably be responses to
their queries. Don’t underestimate the impact your e-mail responses have on
your customers’ perception of the service they receive.
Try these four simple, yet effective, ways to ensure that your e-mail creates
goodwill and a positive service experience for your customers:
 Be timely. The sooner you get back to your customer, the better.
However, a general rule is to return all e-mail inquiries within 24 hours. If
you don’t have the information the customer needs within this time, you
may want to consider using an automated response system. These sys-
tems respond to incoming e-mails with a note saying that the e-mail was
received and is being dealt with. This note acts to fill the gap until you
can get back to your customer with the necessary information.
 Personalize your response. One of the best ways to add a human touch
to your e-mail responses is to use the customer’s name in the greeting.
Too often, e-mails to customers are impersonal and cold. Although it
may seem like a small thing, consider how differently you would feel if
you received an e-mail response that began with “Dear Ms. Smith”
(assuming that you’re a Ms. Smith) than one that started “To Whom It
May Concern” or that had no greeting at all.
 Refer to the original e-mail. Keep in mind that not only do you receive
hundreds of e-mails a day from your customers, but that your customers
also send countless e-mails each day. When you respond, make it easy
for your customers to remember their question by including or referring
specifically to their original question, comment, or problem. If appropri-
ate, you may want to include the text from their original e-mail. This
extra effort on your part saves your customers time and shows that
you’re really paying attention.
Allowing Customers to Find Your Site
The repeated message in the movie Field of Dreams is “if you build it, they
will come.” Although this message may be true of a baseball field, the same is
decidedly untrue of a Web site. The reality is that even if you build the Eiffel
Tower of Web sites — a shining example of design and interactivity — you
won’t get the online traffic you’re hoping for if people aren’t aware that your
site exists or don’t know how to find it.
In order to maximize your Web site, you must create an overall plan for pro-
moting your site that compels current and potential customers to visit you
online. First, determine who you’re trying to attract by asking yourself the fol-
lowing questions:
282
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

 What audience are we trying to reach?
 Who would benefit most from visiting our site?
 Who do we have the best chance of selling our services and products to?
After you know who your target audience is, the next step is to determine
how you’re going to reach them. Following are three of the best ways to reach
your audience:
 Getting listed with search engines
 Establishing beneficial links with other Web sites
 Creating a public relations campaign that showcases your Web site
In the following sections, we show you what you need to know to list your
site with search engines, to maximize the number of hits your site receives,
and to establish link exchanges to increase traffic at your site.
Getting listed with search engines
Visitors access your Web site one of three ways: They can type in your Web
address on a browser, open your Web site via a bookmark, or find your site
on a search engine, which is a site, such as Google, where customers enter a
word or two that describes what they are searching for and then presents
them with a list of relevant sites. Search engines are only one method of
attracting visitors to your site, but they’re critically important. A few of the
myriad of benefits of getting listed with a search engine are as follows:
 Most search engines list your site for free.
 Search engines make it easier for your current customers to find you.
 Search engines bring new customers to your site.
Submit the following information to each individual search engine that you
want to list your site:
 Company name
 Nature of your business
 Web site address
 Some key words describing your business
Following are the four main ways to do so.
Manual submission
You can manually submit your Web site address, as well as specific informa-
tion for each separate Web page you have, to the individual search engines of
283
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

your choice. You can find out from the search engine companies exactly what
they need. It usually includes the following:
 Web page titles
 Web site title
 Key words regarding XXX
 A 10-word description of your business
 A 25-word description of your business
 A 50-word description of your business
 Your company’s name, address, e-mail, phone, and fax numbers
A search engine is likely to refuse to list your site if you don’t provide all the
information it requests in exactly the format that it wants. It also may not list
your site if your site isn’t active enough or, in some cases, if the search
engine doesn’t like the way your site looks.
Paid submission services
If you have more money than time and you don’t want to go through the sub-
mission process yourself, you can pay someone else to do it. One advantage
of paid submission services is that they allow you to focus on the content of
your Web site, while the submission service takes care of the promotional
work of listing your site with search engines.
Search engine consultants
One result of the Internet is the creation of never-before-heard-of job titles,
such as search engine consultant. Unlike most submission services, these con-
sultants offer a personal service by analyzing your site and using their exper-
tise to get your site listed and, for a fee, they can help you:
 Evaluate your site.
 Design an overall search engine campaign.
 Design key words and content to attract visitors to your site.
 Suggest ways to get high rankings.
 Maximize every file in search engine submission forms.
 Submit your site to a targeted list of search engines.
 Make multiple submissions for individual pages of your site.
If you use a paid consultant, you have access to a professional who can look
over your key words and titles and recommend ways to achieve a higher
placement within the search engines. The common goal is to get your site
listed on the first page of search results because most people never click past
it. The ultimate goal is to have your listing be the first result presented — or
284
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

at least within the top five — which allows you to attract to your site the
greatest number of visitors possible. However, if your budget doesn’t stretch
to paying experts there are other, less expensive options.
Submission software
An alternative to the other submission methods is to purchase one of the
software packages available on the market today that help you with search
engine submissions. Some of these products are better than others, so you
need to do some research to find the best one. Basically, the software works
like a submission service – without the fee. Using submissions software can
save you time, but be aware that most of them don’t allow you to customize
your submissions to gain higher rankings.
Achieving the highest possible ranking
and position in search engine results
The average person accessing a search engine only looks at about 15 listings
before she chooses one or move on. Getting your Web site listed with a
search engine is only half the battle. The other half is getting it ranked as
highly as possible in the search engine results. If you’re not in the top 50
results that a user sees after she types in a search, the chances of new cus-
tomers finding your site are slim to none. You should aim to be in the top 20.
We can’t make any guarantees because the rules for ranking seem to change
daily, but usually you can improve your placement by doing the following.
Selecting your words for maximum hits
A simple four-step strategy exists for choosing the best words to describe
your site on the search engine submission forms. The strategy involves a bit
of research, but the benefit of increased traffic on your site is well worth your
time. You don’t want to lose Web traffic because you didn’t do your homework!
1. Jot down a list of words and phrases you think your customers and
potential customers are most likely to use when trying to find services
and products that relate to the type of business you’re in.
2. Enter these words into the top search engines to see what the top 10
to 20 sites are.
3. Go to each one of these sites and count the number of times that the
words and phrases from the list you generated in Step 1 appear on the
first page of that site.
In addition, view the source code of the page to see what title, key
words, and descriptions have been used to achieve the high ranking.
285
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

4. After you’ve seen which key words, when used repeatedly, are giving
your competitors an upper hand in the rankings, check your own use
of these words in your search engine submission forms and adjust
your language as needed.
In general, the more often a key word appears on your page, the higher any
search engine is likely to rank your site. Be sure to repeat the key words and
phrases that you have determined are the most valuable at least three or four
times within the first 100 words of your page.
Monitoring the status of your position
Many individuals and companies simply submit their site to a search engine,
do what they can to get a high ranking, and, with fingers crossed, hope for
the best. But this mediocre strategy isn’t good enough if you want to capture
as much business as possible with your Web site. After you’ve gone to all the
trouble of submitting your site — properly using all the techniques available
to get you a high ranking — don’t waste your hard work. Regularly check the
status of your positions and work to improve them. This way, if your position
starts to fall, you’ll be able to catch it and fix it right away. You can and should
stay on top of things by checking your ranking once every few months on
each of the top search engines.
Even though you may have obtained a high ranking with a search engine
when you first submitted your site, your position can slip over time because
the Web is dynamic, and competitors, having the same goals as you, can dis-
place you and push you further down the list. You’ll occasionally be com-
pletely dropped from a search engine’s database for no apparent reason.
Since your position in the rankings determines how many people find your
site, staying on top is as important as getting placed.
Maximizing your hits with link exchanges
Link exchanges are a good way to promote your site. A link exchange is a reci-
procal agreement in which you and another site list each other on your
respective Web pages. The beauty of a link exchange program is that you can
select other companies with whom exchanging links would be a natural fit,
mutually beneficial, and inexpensive to boot. Here we discuss the four steps
involved with creating a link exchange program.
Step 1: Define your audience
In order to know which sites you could most beneficially link to, you need to
identify your target audience — the people you want to attract to your site.
Generate a list of what types of customers you want to reach, what types of
Web sites they’re likely to visit, and what related products and services
they’re likely to buy.
286
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

Step 2: Create a target list
After you know what types of sites your potential customers may visit, surf
the Web to see what sites you may want to exchange links with. Come up
with a target list of companies you plan to approach.
Let’s say you own a company that sells baskets. You’ve just come out with a
spiffy new kid-friendly bicycle basket made of titanium and available in hot
pink, black, and the ever-popular chartreuse. Some, but certainly not all, of
your natural link exchange partners include the following:
 A site belonging to the manufacturer of children’s bicycles
 An online magazine for children’s sports
 An online magazine for bicycle enthusiasts
 A site focusing on parenting
 A site dedicated to baskets
Step 3: Customize your contact
After narrowing your list of possible link exchange partners, send a cus-
tomized e-mail message proposing the link. In order to avoid creating the
impression that your message is spam, a message sent indiscriminately to a
multitude of recipients, send your e-mail directly to the decision maker and
make it easy for him to welcome your proposal by including the following
information in your message:
 Your name and position
 Your company’s name and the type of business you’re in
 The types of customers you have
 The reason you think a link would be mutually beneficial (this informa-
tion is the key!)
 Your contact information, including phone number and address
 A request that the person get back to you within a specific time range
Step 4: Decide where to place links
After you’ve agreed to exchange links, you need to negotiate the specific
placement of your link on your partner’s site and your partner’s link on your
site. Base your decision for determining link placement on traffic. Think of
your Web site as real estate. Since your home page represents the most valu-
able real estate on your site, reserve that space for those links from which
you receive the most traffic.
287
Chapter 19: Making Your Web Site Shine with Site Design

Because determining how much traffic a link will generate at the beginning of
a partnership is almost impossible, we suggest that you establish a probation
period with any new link exchange partner in order to test the benefits of the
link and to determine future placement. If a link exchange isn’t working out, a
probation period allows you to get out gracefully.
If a company you exchange links with puts you on its home page, you do not
need to place its link on your home page. Even if you decide that a link is
worthy of occupying the prime real estate of your home page, it should be
placed on the bottom of your page so that customers see your information
first.
Since the goal is to have your customer stay at your site as long as possible,
avoid putting too many links on your site, since doing so increases the
chances that your customer will jump from your site to another, and may or
may not come back.
288
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 
Pick your partners carefully
Any link exchange you establish reflects your
company. The way your partner company does
business can affect your customer’s perception
of you. Remember that visitors to a Web site
assume that a link is an endorsement.
Therefore, regardless of potential benefits,
never link to a site that can hurt your reputation
or credibility. Make sure that any partner com-
pany you link up with:
 Is reputable
 Has an interesting and well-designed site
 Provides useful and valuable information on
its site
 Updates its site regularly
 Shares the business values that your com-
pany has

T
ake your typical day at work. You arrive at the office by 9 a.m., turn on
your computer, and pull up your “to do” list for the day. Some of the
many things that you must accomplish during your typical workday include:
 Confirming the details of an upcoming business trip to China
 Informing a colleague about a schedule change that affects him or her
 Congratulating one of your teammates on closing a sale
 Running a few ideas by your staff members for their input regarding a
service problem
In the business world of ten years ago, you probably would’ve dealt with at
least some of these items with a phone call, a memo, or a face-to-face meet-
ing. Today, however, chances are you’d probably handle most, if not all of
these, by electronic mail (e-mail).
A recent survey of more than 850 companies by the ePolicy Institute found
that more than 50 percent of employees surveyed reported that they spend
between one and two hours each day on e-mail. Another 10 percent surveyed
stated that they spend three to four hours a day.

Weighing E-Mail Pros and Cons
Although we aren’t advocates of using e-mail to the point where it eclipses all
other methods of communication, we do believe that in the hectic pace of
today’s business world, e-mail can be an invaluable tool for receiving and 
disseminating information quickly and easily. As with any communication
technology though, the use of e-mail brings with it both pros and cons.
The pros of e-mail
Face it: Who hasn’t been grateful at one time or another to be able to send 
an e-mail rather than pick up the phone or, worse still, get on a plane? Using
e-mail provides customers with round-the-clock convenience and service
while reducing costs and increasing productivity at work. For example, artifi-
cially intelligent, automated e-mail software enables businesses to process 
up to 1,000 e-mail queries a day from customers for as little as 25 cents per
e-mail. Compare that amount with an estimated $2.75 per e-mail when
answered manually by an individual service provider. Other advantages 
of e-mail include:
 It enables you to communicate with many people simultaneously, by
using multiple addresses.
 It leaves a trail, so that the history of a conversation can be traced.
 It provides an easy reference to past communications.
 It doesn’t require that your customers be available when you send them
a message (a great benefit when working across time zones — you can
accomplish things even while you sleep).
 It saves you time when you need to communicate with someone, but
don’t have time for small talk.
 It enables you to attach pertinent files that recipients can easily open
(usually) without the delay involved with other mail delivery systems.
The cons of e-mail
Although e-mail has big upside potential, its use doesn’t always mean that
customers get better service or that communication is improved. E-mail 
communication, although convenient, doesn’t always obey the rules of con-
versation. Electronic messages cannot convey your facial expressions, body
language, tone of voice, or other clues to the real meaning of your words.
290
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

Consequently, e-mail communications are far more likely to be misinterpreted
than if you were to have those same communications face-to-face. Some of
the other perils to using e-mail as a main medium of communication in busi-
ness are that it:
 Isn’t the best medium for communicating certain emotional or highly
charged issues
 Often is overused as a substitute for phone and in-person 
communications
 Isn’t as secure, private, and confidential as people think
 Can be used in a court of law as evidence and increases company liabil-
ity and risk
 Can be problematic when dealing with time-sensitive issues that require
immediate responses
291
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium
Recognizing real-world limitations of e-mail
Although e-mail provides a fast and convenient
means of communication, it doesn’t work well
for all messages. Using e-mail most often is
inappropriate:
 When sending messages of a confidential
nature. Because e-mails are not private —
in other words, they can be forwarded to
the moon and back — don’t use them for
anything that is of a private nature. Have a
face-to-face meeting or use the telephone
for topics that are emotional or related to
coaching or counseling an employee.
 When sharing big news, such as a
takeover by another company. We once
conducted an employee survey for a large
company. The overriding feedback was that
a lack of communication existed from top
echelons down.
Executives defended themselves by stating
that during the recent takeover by another
company, they had sent monthly e-mails to
staff members to keep everyone informed.
The point these executives missed was that
most employees want to hear important
(potentially life-changing) news from a live
person with whom they can interact and
ask questions.
 When dealing with time-sensitive issues.
Consider that most people don’t check their
e-mail as often as their voice mail when
they’re on the road and away from their
desks. Urgent matters, especially when a
customer needs a speedy response, need
to be pursued via the telephone, although
you can certainly send an e-mail as well.
 When distressed customers need immediate
problem resolution, or at least a sympathetic
ear. Sending an e-mail isn’t as personal as
engaging in a conversation. When dealing
with matters that require empathy, under-
standing, and a resolution, you need to have
a dialogue.

Testing Your E-Mail Etiquette
E-mail is ubiquitous and as such requires an established etiquette that helps
ensure that good manners are the rule rather than the exception in cyber-
space. The age-old idea behind etiquette, electronic or otherwise, is to show
consideration for other people. The simplest way of doing just that is to ask
yourself, “How would I feel if I received this message?” After you peruse the
e-mail message that follows and answer this basic question, read through the
ten most common e-mail mistakes that the sender makes and the “E-Mail
Etiquette Solutions” section. Finally, think about whether you unwittingly
commit any digital faux pas in your e-mail communications.
The following is an actual e-mail (with a little creative license taken by the

We hope it’s obvious that the author of the preceding e-mail didn’t take the
time to think about how his or her message was coming across to the reader.
What impression did you have of the person who wrote this? If you received
this message, would you want to go out of your way to help this person?
Probably not. Although it’s obvious that the general tone of the message is
unfriendly, the sender has made ten common mistakes that are guaranteed 
to create a lukewarm response and possibly a quick tap of the reader’s 
Delete key.
 Mistake 1: Unclear subject line. The subject line in this e-mail is simply
titled “screw up.” Not only does this title create a negative tone, but it
also provides the reader with no idea of what the e-mail is about until
the document is opened.
 Mistake 2: A poor greeting or no greeting. The writer makes no attempt
to create rapport by greeting the reader. Instead he/she simply starts
with a description of the problem. Not only is this unfriendly, but it also
may put the reader on the defensive. A greeting is one of the few ways 
to convey “tone” through e-mail.
 Mistake 3: Using abbreviations not commonly used or understood.
The writer has included two abbreviations that are not in common use
by business people today. Using such hard-to-understand language is
roughly the equivalent of sending an e-mail in English to someone who
speaks only French! The possibilities for misunderstanding and misinter-
pretations abound. By the way, to see what the abbreviations mean,
check out solutions section in the next section of the chapter.
 Mistake 4: Unnecessary CC (carbon copy) of the posting. The four
people to whom the author has CCed the message more than likely 
have no real impact on solving the problem, and the copies are just a
way for the author to cybergossip and vent his or her frustrations.
293
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium
Better etiquette = happier people
We were consulting with a well-known high-
tech company, when the subject of e-mail arose.
Much to our surprise, the group turned ugly at
the mere mention of the topic. It turns out that
poorly written e-mails had contributed to a hos-
tile working environment between individuals
and, in some cases, entire departments. We’d
assumed that being high tech the company 
naturally would make its e-mails high touch. We
were wrong. As is true with developing phone
tone and writing winning letters, crafting effec-
tive e-mails is a learned skill. Even in an environ-
ment where folks should’ve known better, the
rules of online excellence weren’t clear and cer-
tainly not universally used.

 Mistake 5: Sloppy grammar, spelling, and punctuation. By not taking
the time to spell- or grammar-check his e-mail, the composer runs the
risk of creating a negative online impression. Sloppy e-mails, especially
those with flagrant misspellings, lower your credibility with the receiver.
 Mistake 6: Uses all capital letters to make a point. By using all caps in
one of the sentences, the author basically is throwing an online hissy fit.
In the digital community, putting all or part of your e-mail in capital let-
ters is equivalent to shouting and yelling.
 Mistake 7: No closing or sign-off. In the same way that the sender uses
no introductory salutation or greeting to set a friendly tone upfront, he
or she also omitted a closing or sign-off to end the posting on a positive
note.
 Mistake 8: Difficult to read. The run-on sentences, repeated points, 
and absence of paragraph formatting make it obvious that the author
isn’t concerned with making his e-mail user-friendly. Instead, the mes-
sage rambles on, reflecting no respect for the reader’s time or ease of
understanding.
 Mistake 9: Unfriendly tone. The tone of this e-mail is accusing and hos-
tile. Because the reader immediately is put on the defensive, the likeli-
hood of a helpful response is about the same as Larry Ellison and Bill
Gates going on vacation together.
 Mistake 10: Lack of a clear request. What does the author of this 
e-mail really want from the accounting department? Because this mes-
sage is full of so many questions and requests, the person reading it 
will be hard-pressed to figure out which actions need to be taken to 
best satisfy the sender. E-mails are either requests for actions or FYIs.
Let your reader know upfront which one it is.
E-Mail Etiquette Solutions
The ten mistakes described in the preceding section can all be corrected and
avoided by following basic rules of e-mail etiquette. In this section, we dis-
cuss each of these rules and how to carry them out.
Providing a context
Picture this question being asked over the phone or during a meeting: 
“When can I get the fourth-quarter report? I know it was scheduled to 
be out yesterday.”
294
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

Myriad different vocal tones, facial expressions, and hand gestures help
convey the context and meaning behind the question.
Now imagine checking your e-mail inbox and seeing this same sentence pop
up on your computer screen. Without body language and tone of voice, vital
signals are removed from the message, increasing the potential for misunder-
standing, miscommunication, and hurt feelings. Keeping that in mind, here
are some ways of providing a context for your e-mails that help your reader
accurately interpret the meaning of your message.
When in doubt, ask. If the context of a specific message isn’t clear to you,
send it back and ask for clarification. This solution is by far better than pro-
ceeding on what can be a mistaken assumption that creates more problems.
Setting a tone
How would you interpret the importance and significance of each of the 
following?
 A co-worker writes you a sticky note and posts it on your desk while
you’re out to lunch.
 A memo is distributed to your department from company headquarters.
 A formal letter is sent to you from the president’s office.
Chances are that the form in which these messages arrived gave you a clue
as to the importance of the communication. E-mail messages, on the other
hand, all look alike! You can’t tell by the format the intended level of signifi-
cance or importance. By going beyond the straight presentation of the facts
and adding tone to the message, you can help your reader distinguish
whether your communication is a formal request, a casual inquiry, or a firm
instruction.
If letterhead and precise formatting are important parts of conveying your
message, consider creating the document in your word processing program
and then adding it as an attachment to your e-mail cover introduction.
Using a specific subject line
One easy way to establish the context of your message is to write a subject
line with a few well-chosen words that provide the reader with a clue to what
you’re writing about. Avoid writing generic subject lines such as:
 Re: Problem
 Re: Report
 Re: Request
295
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium

You can help the reader understand the bigger picture of your message by
referencing any related e-mail to which you’re responding or taking a few
lines upfront to explain the reason for your message.
Saying it with electronic emotion
One disadvantage of e-mail is that feelings you’re normally able to get across
in person or by phone are more difficult to express in the colder medium of
electronic mail. Because emotions add flavor to your conversations at work,
finding a way to integrate them into your e-mails is essential.
Emoticons
One quick-and-easy way to add feeling or tone to your e-mails is to use what
are popularly referred to as emoticons or smileys. Emoticons (a hip word if
ever we heard one) are just that — icons that express emotions. Some are
useful, some are bizarre, and a few convince you that some people just have
too much time on their hands.
Because this book is rated PG, we won’t go into the racier emoticons that
we’ve seen, but here are some of the more commonly used ones:
: - ) The smile is the most popular symbol used in e-mail today. It rep-
resents humor or pleasure and is made by a colon symbol, followed by a
dash, followed by a right parenthesis. As in:
What I especially liked about this morning’s meeting
was the muffins :-)
: - ( The frown is the second most popular of emoticons and is used to
conveys sadness or disappointment. It is made by a colon symbol, fol-
lowed by a dash, followed by a left parenthesis. As in:
I wish Alexis had been able to make the meeting today
:-(
Too many emoticons spoil the soup. Avoid the tendency to be overly cute in
your e-mail messages by peppering them with an overabundance of emoti-
cons — especially in more formal business communications, where misused
or overused emoticons trivialize the power of your message and make you
look unprofessional.
Bracketed expressions
Another useful way to express emotion in your electronic communication is
through the use of bracketed expressions. These are feelings put in angle
296
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

brackets at the end of a sentence; they generally leave less room for misun-
derstanding than emoticons because the actual feeling is being specified
rather than represented in picture form. For example:
I think we should proceed slowly on this agreement 
<apprehension>.
Minimizing abbreviations
Because e-mail culture leans toward brevity rather than length, abbreviations
are popular in this medium. Messages that rely too much on acronyms to get
their ideas across can confuse and annoy your reader. Use acronyms spar-
ingly and try to stick to the ones that already are commonly used — like the
ones in Table 22-1.

Keeping messages clear and concise
An award-winning writer once said that the key to great writing is editing.
That adage is as true with e-mail messages as it is with a Pulitzer Prize–
winning novel. Good e-mails are to the point but not so short that they create
the impression of being rudely curt. Most people, however, lean toward being
one or the other of overcommunicators or undercommunicators.
Overcommunicators
Some people think of e-mail as the perfect place to hone their skills as budding
novelists. They fill the screen with tons of text and agonizing detail that not
only is unnecessary but detracts from the power of their messages. The motive
for this overcommunication often is often a CYA mentality. If you fall into this
category, use the following questions to keep your e-mails short and sweet:
 Have I included so many points that my main point is lost?
 Is there a way that I can say this in fewer words?
 Have I unnecessarily repeated information that has been confirmed by a
prior e-mail?
 Is my message longer than 25 lines? If so, is there a document I need to
attach instead?

Undercommunicators
Equally as ineffective are people who believe less is more. These writers
don’t put enough information in their messages and shorten them to the
point where they run the risk of being seen as rude and offensive. If you think
your e-mails can use a little fattening up, ask yourself the following questions:
 Have I provided enough information for the reader to understand what I
am saying or requesting?
 Are there any previous e-mails to which I need to refer so that I enhance
the context of this message?
 Do I need to add any detail to this message, or is it understandable as 
it is?
 Would an attached document be helpful?
Avoiding multiple media
A few eager beavers out there (you know who you are) insist on sending the
same message to a co-worker in every communication medium possible. For
example, they send an e-mail, leave a voice mail (telling the recipient that
they sent an e-mail), and just for good measure, they fax the information con-
tained within the e-mail to the e-mail recipient. Let us be blunt: Don’t! Just
plain don’t do this! Overkill is annoying and wastes time. If an e-mail is the
best format for your communication, stick to it and have some faith that your
message will get through.
Whenever you’re concerned about receiving verification that an important
message was received by a colleague, use the return receipt feature available
on some e-mail systems. If this feature isn’t an option for you, wait at least
two days before sending a second e-mail to inquire about the status of the
first one. Of course, if your e-mail is urgent, don’t hesitate to ask the reader 
to reply within a given time frame so that you can confirm receipt of your
message.
Don’t OD on the CC
For our readers who aren’t old enough to remember where CC came from, it
stands for carbon copy, which in ancient times way back in the 20th century
was the only practical way to duplicate letters. The best thing about carbon
copies was that they were limited; you could make only three good copies
from any one document. E-mail, however, enables you to make virtually unlim-
ited copies to be shot off effortlessly and instantaneously with a quick click 
on the CC box. Of all the e-mail complaints we hear about in our training ses-
sions, sending out too many CCed copies is at the top of the list. Before you
CC anyone, ask yourself the following questions:
299
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium

 Is this information critical/important for the recipient to know?
 Is this information that the recipient would want to know?
 Does this information require some action on the part of the recipient?
 Am I just CCing this person to cover my electronic behind?
If you answer yes to any of the first three questions, then CC away. If the
answer to the fourth question is yes, resist the temptation, live dangerously,
and don’t pass on information that clogs up the exit on your co-worker’s elec-
tronic highway.
Always make sure that your CC box is empty when replying to an e-mail.
Depending on how your e-mail preferences are set, hitting the reply button
for a message to which a whole string of people were CCed with the original
message may automatically attach the e-mail addresses of those same people
to your reply. Repeating, make sure that your CC box is the way that you
want it before sending your reply.
Reviewing your e-mail before you send it
The number of people who merely type a quick e-mail message on their key-
board and then shoot it off without reading it through is astounding. Falling
into the trap of thinking, “It’s e-mail; I can be casual about this,” is so easy.
But don’t be fooled by the apparent informality of the medium . . . you’re still
representing yourself, and you’re still sending out a communication that can
be seen by an untold number of people. Customers are slow to forgive bad
manners and probably won’t take the attitude, “Oh well, it’s only e-mail.”
Review your document carefully, because after you press the send button,
you can’t take it back!
Nothing is harder to read than a solid block of text with run-on sentences 
and paragraphs that meld into each other. Create an easier-to-read docu-
ment by using no more than 75 words per sentence, starting new ideas with 
a distinctly separate paragraph, and remembering that italicized and bolded
text doesn’t often translate.
Starting and finishing on the right foot
Start all e-mails with the standard salutation of “Dear So-and-So.” A couple of
guidelines to keep in mind are:
 If you’re contacting the person for the first time and want to maintain an
air of formality, use his or her respective courtesy title (Ms., Mr., Mrs., or
Dr., for example) and last name.
300
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

 If you’re responding to a message, use the same level of formality the
sender uses with you. If the writer uses your first name, use the writer’s
first name; if the writer uses your last name, address the writer in the
same manner.
Follow the salutation with an introductory sentence or two such as:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday.
 It was a pleasure speaking with you.
 Thank you for responding to my earlier e-mail.
 Thanks for your quick response.
 In response to your e-mail . . .
 I am contacting you on the recommendation of . . .
A perfectly good e-mail can be ruined by an abrupt ending. At the end of your
message, be sure to sign off the same way you would with any letter or fax.
Most e-mail programs have a feature that enables you to automatically add a
personalized footer. Use this signature to include your full name and contact
information for the reader’s convenience.
Conduct a training session with members of your staff to go over the basics
of e-mail etiquette, use, and ethics. By getting everyone within your group
onboard, you make e-mail an effective tool within your office. If you need
some help, check out our online training program titled “Essential E-mail” at
www.scgtraining.com.
Applying the rules of 
grammar and spelling
Two camps have formed regarding the necessity of proper grammar and
spelling in electronic messages:
 The first camp (usually the ones who don’t spell well) thinks that 
worrying about spelling and grammar defeats the spontaneity and 
convenience of e-mail.
 The second camp (the kids who got A’s in English) thinks that e-mail is 
a written communication and therefore should be subject to the same
rules and regulations that apply to its cousins the letter, the memo, and
the fax.
301
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium

We’re definitely huddles around the bonfire at the second camp, although
Karen (coauthor Karen Leland, that is) would be in deep trouble without her
spell-checker. The bottom line is that bad grammar and poor spelling create a
negative impression and take away from the message you mean to get across.
Any business communication on which you place your name needs to repre-
sent the competent professional that you are.
Don’t get into the habit of overusing question marks and exclamation points.
What would you think if a simple sentence was followed by a dozen question
marks???????????? Overpunctuation is definitely OTT (over the top) for busi-
ness communication!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Making your message visually 
appealing and easy to read
Few things are harder or more annoying to read than an e-mail that has no
paragraphs. Be sure to create a new paragraph for each different idea and
topic. Remember that in many cases, formatting — such as bullet points, bold,
and italics — is lost in translation and may not show up on your reader’s pages
in the same way that it does on yours. The best approach is to keep it simple
so that anyone who receives your e-mail can read it with ease.
Writing E-Mails that Produce Results
Obviously, no guarantees exist that an e-mail you send will produce the 
result that you want. However, you can improve the odds that you’ll get 
the response that you’re looking for if you carefully craft the language you
use in your messages.
In this section, we introduce a few techniques that can help make your
e-mails more effective, and we include a few exercises to help you practice
the techniques.
Prioritizing your paragraphs
Many of our clients receive more e-mails than they can possibly read —
unless they give up weekends and family life. To be able to deal with the
bulging mailbox problem, many of them read only the first paragraph of all
but the most important of messages. So if your e-mail doesn’t qualify as an
A1, most important, top-of-the-line priority in the reader’s eyes, it may never
get a full read. Thus getting your message across in the first sentence or two
is crucial, because anything that follows may not be read and therefore is of
questionable worth.
302
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

We found out the hard way when we were using e-mail to set up dinner
arrangements with a busy executive. Rather than sending an e-mail for the
specific purpose of arranging dinner, we simply added the invitation to the
end of a business-related message we needed to send to the executive. He
always sent very courteous and speedy replies to our other questions, but he
never responded to our dinner invitation. Eventually, we figured it out. He
wasn’t reading beyond the first paragraph. Like it or not, we realized that this
was his way of dealing with an overburdened mailbox. As soon as we sent a
short e-mail, specifically asking for possible dinner dates, he responded
immediately.
We’re not suggesting that you always write one-paragraph e-mails, but it does
make sense to make sure that the first paragraph in each of your messages
contains the most important information. We call this technique top-down
writing.
Top-down writing exercise
Practice your top-down writing skills by looking at the following e-mail. We
scrambled the order of the paragraphs. Find out whether you can rearrange
them in order of importance. A space is provided at the end of each para-
graph for you to write in the number that represents what you think each
paragraph’s priority is. You can check your answer in the next section.

Use concise and meaningful subject lines. Some people judge an e-mail by the
subject line alone and delete messages before ever reading the contents.
Putting your request upfront
In the prioritizing exercise, you saw the importance of making the first para-
graph count. It follows, therefore, that if your e-mail is asking the recipient to
take some kind of action, your request needs to be included within that first
paragraph of the message.
304
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

After you realize that you must place your request where it’s likely to be read,
you must do whatever you can to ensure that it produces the results that you
want. Obviously, you can’t guarantee that other people will do what you say
or ask (unless you’re a hypnotist), but writing a clear request can definitely
improve your chances. The sections that follow discuss four factors to think
about when you send a request.
Specify the action you’re requesting
Make sure the recipient understands exactly what is expected of him or her.
For example, you may write something like, “To investigate your claim, I will
need a letter stating the circumstances.”
But you can be even more specific, because the recipient of such an e-mail
can easily respond with a letter that’s not detailed enough or with a small
phonebook of information.
A better request would be, “To investigate your claim, I need a one- or two-
page letter that states the general circumstances.”
Set a time frame
When you send a message that requires some action, be sure to state specific
time requirements so that no misunderstanding (or missed deadlines) can
arise. For example, saying something like, “I need the report as soon as you
can get it to me” can be interpreted by the recipient as, “Just send it as soon
as you’ve dealt with all your other, more pressing priorities.”
A better request would be, “I would like the report by 2 p.m. Wednesday.”
Establish mutual understanding
Much confusion can arise whenever people on the sending and receiving
ends of an e-mail don’t completely understand the contents of the message.
You may not get the response you’re hoping for if the person to whom you’re
sending an e-mail doesn’t understand all the underlying circumstances. For
example, sending an e-mail to your Chicago office (when you’re working in
San Francisco) requesting a conference call at 4 p.m. may not produce the
result you’d like — when it’s 4 p.m. in Chicago, it’s 2 p.m. in San Francisco,
and when it’s 4 p.m. in San Francisco, it’s 6 p.m. in Chicago.
Evaluate the competence of your recipient
Make sure you send your request to someone who is capable of responding
satisfactorily. No matter how well formed your e-mail request, if the person 
to whom you send it is not competent to fulfill it, then your request won’t 
be answered. For example, sending an e-mail to a newly hired front-line
employee asking her to put together an intranet staff directory would be
inappropriate. This new person wouldn’t have sufficient knowledge to 
complete the job quickly or competently.

Trimming the fat
Using unnecessary words is a major obstacle to e-mail efficiency. Many
people write the same way they talk. The problem with that is the spoken
word is much less tightly woven than the written word; when you write, you
ought to be more succinct than when you talk. A customer reading an e-mail
has far less tolerance for repetition and unclear phrasing than a customer
with whom you’re having a conversation.
The spoken word also is accompanied by many visual and auditory cues that
generate interest and understanding. When you read, you’re focused on the
words — nothing more. The words alone need to be sufficient to convey your
point concisely yet courteously. We include the exercise that follows to give
you practice adjusting language to make it tighter and clearer.
Trim the fat exercise
Go through the following e-mail and remove the words that you believe dilute
the message. Feel free to add a new word or two if they help make the mes-
sage more concise.

Re: Last Thursday’s Meeting
Hello to all,
I just wanted to take a moment to give you my perspective
of the very heated discussion that occurred during the
first part of last Thursday’s lively meeting.
First and foremost, I felt it was not supportive of our
teambuilding efforts for all of us to be so defensive
about our reports. Let’s face it, I believe we all tend to
take on a personal attachment to those things that we pro-
duce, but rarely are we willing to have the necessary
degree of objectivity to be able to discuss it in a posi-
tive and open way.
As a result, I feel that some of us felt, to some degree,
betrayed by the rather negative comments made by others.
Likewise, I personally felt attacked and otherwise not
supported for both my content as well as my efforts.

If we are to move forward as a team, then we need to sup-
port each other as a team. At this point in time, I wel-
come any and all discussions regarding my thoughts here as
long as they are in constructive form. Furthermore, if any
of you wish to meet to clear the air, I would most defi-
nitely welcome that as well.

E-Mail Ethics
The explosion of e-mail has led to new spins on age-old issues, such as pri-
vacy rights, intellectual property, copyright, freedom of speech, and political
correctness. Few areas in recent history can compare with the challenges
that the legal system now faces as it’s stretched to the limits by the popular-
ity of e-mail and the Internet in general. In this section, we cover issues that
we think are the most critical for you to be aware of in today’s working world.
307
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium

Whose e-mail is it anyway?
If you’re like most people, you probably assume that the contents of the
e-mail messages you send are private and belong to you. Well, think again.
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act ruled that internal e-mails are
the property of the company that pays for the e-mail system, thereby giving
companies the right to search your mailbox. According to a study by the
American Management Association, 20 percent (and growing) of all compa-
nies are regularly and randomly taking a peek at their employees’ e-mails.
The next time you write an e-mail, consider how the following factors impact
the privacy of the message you’re about to send:
 Because most messages are sent in ASCII text, anyone can read them.
Only encrypted text cannot be read without first being decoded by a
computer.
 In any large corporation, a systems administrator has access to all mes-
sages sent to, from, and within the company.
 E-mails frequently are sent by accident to someone or a group of some-
ones who are not the intended recipients.
 People often forward e-mails sent to them by someone else without the
sender’s knowledge or permission.
 E-mail can automatically be forwarded to another employee when one of
the employee’s co-workers is out of town.
 Some companies have policies that include regular screening of
employee e-mail.
 Firms specializing in recovering e-mail, even deleted ones, can and do
use e-mail for evidence in civil and criminal court cases.

Careful, big brother may be watching you
We were having lunch one day with a client, and
inquired into how one of the staff members was
doing. To our surprise, we were told that the indi-
vidual no longer was employed by the company.
It seems he had developed a habit of surfing 
the Web for personal reasons on company time.
A company investigation showed that this
employee was spending an average of three to
four hours during the workday, accessing sites
for personal use. Upon discovering of the
employee’s wayward ways, he was given the
choice of resigning or being fired.

Here today, not gone tomorrow
Despite the seemingly fleeting nature of your e-mail messages, they are
nonetheless a permanent record of your communication, and that’s a good
thing to keep in mind when considering what you should and should not
send into cyberspace. Careful consideration will avoid your having said
something electronically that you may regret and possibly have to defend,
weeks, months, or even years later.
The bottom line is that e-mail has become a form of evidence as acceptable in
legal disputes as any written document. As a recent article in Wired magazine
states, “Old e-mail never dies.” In fact, a whole new industry known as com-
puter forensics has come into existence in the past few years. Companies in
this field specialize solely in locating e-mails (usually for litigation purposes)
that people believe are deleted and long gone.
Flames, spam, and harassment
A difference exists between an e-mail that is poorly written or has an
unfriendly tone and one that has crossed over into the realm of e-buse.
Question: What is the online equivalent of
 A co-worker leaving you a nasty note on your desk with a few choice
words that can’t be said on a prime-time television show?
 A telemarketer calling you at home, during dinner, to sell you swamp
land in Florida?
 Your boss making uninvited advances toward you?
Answer: A flame, spam, and harassment. No, that isn’t the name of a new rock
group but rather three of the worst and most common breeches of etiquette/
ethics possible in business cyberspace.
309
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium
No place to hide
Robert Anderson and Norman Shapiro wrote a
study titled “Toward an Ethics and Etiquette for
Electronic Mail.” In the study, Anderson high-
lights that e-mail’s greatest “phenomenon is its
propensity to lead to misinterpretation and . . . the
strange permanence yet volatility of electronic
messages.” The funny thing: Mr. Anderson wrote
this passage in 1985, when less than 1 million
Americans were regularly using the medium. His
advice then still holds true: “Never say anything
(on e-mail) you wouldn’t want appearing, and
attributed to you, in tomorrow morning’s front-
page headline in The New York Times.”

Support a flame-free environment
In short, a flame is a verbal attack in electronic form that oftentimes can set
into motion an equally heated response. You may someday send what you
consider to be a harmless message and find that you get back a not-so-harm-
less response. Or you may just be on the receiving end of a customer or co-
worker’s anger and frustration. In any case, if you are flamed, the number one
rule is: Do not engage. Despite all temptations to enter a flame war by shoot-
ing back an equally bad, nasty response, don’t. Stop flaming in its tracks
either by ignoring the offending comments, calling the person and telling him
how you felt, or sending a response back that politely asks the person to
clean up her e-mail.
Never send an e-mail that you’ve written when you’re angry, exhausted, or on
the verge of tearing your hair out from frustration. Always compose yourself
before composing your e-mail.
Zero tolerance for spams
Spamming has unfortunately become all too commonplace in the e-mail envi-
ronment. According to industry experts, an estimated 10 billion pieces of
spam shoot through the Internet each year. The most common type of spam
is when a company, hoping to find a few fish to bite on its line, sends out a
single advertising message to huge numbers of e-mail users. These messages
arrive in your mailbox as unsolicited e-mail — the electronic equivalent of all
the junk mail you get everyday courtesy of the post office. The big difference
is that the letters that come in the mail can be thrown away unopened, while
junk e-mail often requires taking the time to open and then delete. This prob-
lem is fast becoming a big one for businesses as advertisers find ways to
reach online mailboxes in the workplace.
You can avoid becoming part of the problem by never, under any circum-
stances, sending non-business related, unsolicited e-mail of a sales, market-
ing, advertising, or inappropriate personal nature to your business associates
or colleagues. That means don’t
 Forward your electronic newsletter — unasked for
 Advertise that your 1967 Chevy Camaro is for sale
 Send a chain letter threatening the recipients with a hideous future if
they don’t forward it to ten others
 Complain about what a yahoo your boss’s wife is
Remember, people’s e-mail boxes do not function as a company bulletin
board for posting your personal agenda.
310
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

If you legitimately were referred to someone by a third party, state that fact
upfront in your message line and greeting. Similarly, don’t give any of your
colleagues’ e-mail addresses to any mailing lists without their permission.
Online harassment
Using cyberspace for harassment, sexual or otherwise, goes beyond bad
manners. It is a deep violation of the receiver, and it’s against the law. Many
cases in which advances and/or threats were made via e-mail using company
computers have been documented. We heard of one case in which a male
manager was sending one of his female employees e-mails regarding routine
business items and peppering them with occasional outrageous sexual sug-
gestions as if it were an acceptable part of their business relationship. The
employee simply filed the e-mails electronically, made hard copies, and went
to the human resources department. Her manager, needless to say, was fired.
Under no circumstances is it permissible to harass anyone using the medium
of e-mail. Even if you think the other person is receptive to your personal
attentions, using the Internet in this way is an open invitation for problems
and even legal action.
A more innocuous form of harassment is the person who likes to send out
dirty jokes to his customers and colleagues. We recommend that you ask
before you send to avoid offending those you work with.
Creating Online Rapport
Rapport is defined in Webster’s New World College Dictionary as “a close or
sympathetic relationship.” Good customer service requires that you establish
rapport with your customers. Having good rapport makes your customers feel
like they’re more than just a source of income. They’ll be much more likely to
give you valuable feedback or stick with your company through a few service

Banning spam
In a recent California court case, a former
Fortune 500 Company employee who had been
fired retaliated by sending bulk e-mail to 29,000
of the company’s employees, criticizing the
company and his firing — your basic slam
spam. As a result, the company had to spend
time and money trying to block the e-mails and
addressing employees’ concerns about the
mailings. The ex-employee claimed he was just
exercising his right to free speech. The state
court decided he was trespassing on company
property by sending the mass mailings and
granted a permanent injunction barring him
from doing it again.

blunders if rapport has been established. As a business professional, you
probably know how to quickly build rapport — look your customers in the
eye, make chit-chat, get to know them.
But how do you establish rapport over e-mail? You don’t have those long
business lunches to bond over. You don’t have body language to read, as in
even brief face-to-face contacts. You can’t even listen carefully to the tone of
a customer’s voice, as you can over the phone. In this chapter, we give you a
few great techniques for establishing what we call e-rapport.
We all speak the same language. Or do we? In our workshops, we often get
participants to think about language by asking them what comes to mind
when we say “orange.” Responses include the fruit, the color, the county in
southern California, and offbeat ones like “the sweater I wore yesterday.” The
point is that, although we all use similar words, we each use them in our own
unique way. Creating e-rapport requires honing in on the language choices
that the other person is making and then responding with similar language. 
In other words, figuring out the other person’s wavelength, and then putting
yourself on it.
E-rapport is the skill of using e-mail to get closer to your customers by get-
ting on their wavelength, so that you don’t have to fly blind simply because
you don’t receive visual or auditory cues. Two powerful techniques that help
ensure harmonious relations online are using sensory language and back-
tracking key words. Read on for more about these techniques.
Using sensory language
When they speak or write, most people use words that relate to the senses of
seeing, hearing, and feeling. Without realizing it, individuals often use one
sense more than another, and so that person’s e-mail messages contain
words relating specifically to that sense. Here are three sentences that say
the same thing using different sensory words:
 I see your perspective (visual).
 I hear what you’re saying (auditory).
 I feel that you have a point (tactile).
By using sensory words that are consistent with your customers’ main 
style, you add a rapport-building quality to the messages you send. The 
following sentence is written in neutral language (language that has no 
sensory relationship):
I am interested in knowing more about your products and services.
312
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

Now, here is the same sentence translated into language that uses the three
primary senses:
 I look forward to seeing the information about your products and 
services.
 I’d like to hear more about the service and products you offer.
 I’d be happy if you’d get in touch with me about the products and ser-
vices you offer.
All four sentences contain the same basic message, yet the change in sensory
language gives each one a different flavor.
Before responding to an e-mail, quickly scan the words in the original mes-
sage to find out which sense dominates the language the sender uses. After
you know the writer’s sensory preference, reply to the e-mail using a prepon-
derance of those sensory-specific words. The chances are that the recipient
will feel a sense of rapport with you — usually without ever knowing the spe-
cific relationship-enhancing steps that you’ve taken.
Crafting visual messages
Writers with a visual preference use words to paint pictures and create
images of what they want to communicate. Some words that you can use
when communicating with a person who leans toward visual language
include
 Clarify
 Focus
 Look
 See
 Vision
 Perspective
 Clear
 Observe
The following phrases are visual:
 I see what you mean.
 That looks good.
 I’m a little hazy about that.
 Let’s try and shed some light on . . .
 I have a different view of the situation.
313
Chapter 20: E-Mail Etiquette and Writing: Making the Most of the Medium

 I get the picture.
 I appreciate your insight.
 I look forward to seeing you.
Incorporating auditory language
Writers with an auditory preference use words and phrases that give tone to
what they’re saying. Some words that you can use to give an e-mail an audi-
tory style include
 Sound
 Hear
 Say
 Tell
 Volume
 Loud
 Listen
 Tone
The following phrases are auditory:
 I’m glad to hear it.
 Let me explain.
 We’re in tune.
 Tell me what you hear.
 Everything just clicked.
 That sounds good to me.
 On that note, we should end the discussion.
 That rings a bell.
Using tactile language
Writers with a tactile style use words and phrases that refer to physical sen-
sations when writing a message. Some words that you can use when you
want to create a tactile style include
 Touch
 Feel
 Firm
 Pressure
314

 Relaxed
 Rough
 Solid
The following are tactile phrases:
 It feels right.
 Stay in touch.
 Warm regards.
 It leaves me cold.
 Get a grip.
 Hold on.

Responding to upset customers using e-mail
When sending e-mails to customers or col-
leagues whom you know are upset or angry, use
the following tips to help maintain rapport.
 Delay sending emotional messages. If you
must send an e-mail about a highly emo-
tional topic (face-to-face or phone conver-
sations usually work much better), compose
the note but don’t address it or send it. Read
it again a few hours later and then revise it,
if necessary, before sending it. Make sure
that you’ve responded appropriately and
haven’t reacted inappropriately.
 Soften e-mail messages. If an e-mail mes-
sage you’re sending sounds too curt or
abrupt, add an opening line, such as,
“Thank you for the e-mail” or “It was a plea-
sure hearing from you.”
 Reread your e-mails. Before sending an
e-mail, reread it from beginning to end and
ask yourself whether any parts of it can be
misconstrued by the reader. In certain
instances where there has been a lot of
e-mailing back and forth, it’s a good idea to
revisit the original message just to make
sure that you are still on track and haven’t
lost the point of the original message.
 Get a second opinion. Before sending 
a sensitive or emotional message, have
someone you trust read the e-mail and give
you suggestions for making it more 
customer-friendly.
The following is an example of a neutral e-mail
received from a customer. Note that the mes-
sage creates a feeling of distance rather than
of closeness because of the absence of any
sensory words.
Dear Mr. Smith:
Thank you for your acknowledg-
ment regarding the instrument
that my institution returned to
your company. I am not convinced
that this matter has been fully
taken care of at your end and
request that you forward me the
details of the credit return we
are expecting.
Sincerely, Ms. Jones

Recognizing the effect of neutral language
Neutral language seems formal and business-like compared to sensory lan-
guage. Although neutral language can seem cold and impersonal, it’s useful
when you want to send a formal response to an official or legal document or
when your customer has demonstrated a preference for neutral terms. Some
examples of neutral words include
 Think
 Seems
 Know
 Involve
 Denote
 Recall
 Matter
Backtracking key words
When writing e-mails, people choose specific words and phrases that they
think are great ways to describe the situation or that they have a predilection
for using. The e-rapport skill of backtracking key words requires you to pick
up on the key words that the other person uses. Then you repeat back some
of the key words or phrases. What do you think are the most important
words and phrases in the following e-mail?
Dear Esther:
I strongly suspect that our customers are mystified by the
pricing information on our Web site. I would like to meet
at your earliest convenience to remedy the situation.
Regards, Sarah
The key words are:
 Strongly
 Suspect
 Mystified
 Remedy
316
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

Now use some or all of these key words in composing your response. For
example:
Dear Sarah:
I think you are right in suspecting that customers are
mystified by the Web pricing. Can you meet me tomorrow
morning at 10:30 to work on a remedy?
Regards, Esther
By using a sprinkling of the senders’ words in your response, you mirror back
to them something familiar. The more they recognize their style in your
response (consciously or subconsciously), the more they feel a sense of rap-
port and trust.

CRM: Automating the 
Personal Touch
In This Chapter
 Introducing customer relationship management
 Enhancing service with effective technology
 Learning from CRM
 Identifying resources to help get you started
F
ast, inexpensive, and easy-to-access technology has hatched a new world
of customer tracking possibilities. Any size company can now maintain a
database and effortlessly track all the comings and goings of its customers. In
this chapter, we look at the latest online customer service technology, customer
relationship management (CRM), and give you ideas for using its principles in
your business, big or small, so that it serves you, rather than vice versa.
Defining Customer Relationship
Management
Customer relationship management, when used in conjunction with a customer-
centric business strategy, enables your company to track every aspect of 
the customer relationship. You can determine who bought what and when
they bought it. When you have a profile on each customer, you can transform
each business interaction into a dialogue. In effect, you can talk to the cus-
tomer as if you know him or her. By using CRM technology to understand the
customer’s relationship with your company, you create a one-to-one relation-
ship with hundreds or thousands of customers at a time.

Too often, the relentless pursuit of higher profits is the sole driver for many
CRM initiatives. A corresponding commitment to customer care is sadly lack-
ing. Customers become frustrated and disheartened by companies that mis-
takenly believe that every human interaction can be replaced by techno-
logical applications. Customers love technology when it resolves a problem
quickly; they’re not so crazy about it when it hinders progress and creates an
even bigger problem. After all, most of us have lost brain cells through the
stress of trying to navigate a poorly designed voice-mail system.
The fundamentals of online customer service are the same on this side of the
digital divide as they were on the analog side. Quality customer service still
consists of listening to customers, doing everything you can to fulfill their
needs, and knowing what to do when you can’t.
Customers who feel they’re in a dialogue with your organization — who feel
as if they’re listened to — become lifelong customers. As the relationship
matures, they spend more and more of their money with your company while
requiring little or no incentive to continue purchasing. The more you under-
stand about CRM, the more the line blurs between sales and service (read
more about turning service into sales in Chapter 13).
Developing Trust and Loyalty Online
When implemented effectively, CRM can add tremendous value to your com-
pany by helping you create and retain loyal customers. This loyalty is devel-
oped through the types of experiences customers have with your company. If
you can consistently provide competent and immediate service, you increase
the likelihood that your customers will stay with you.
In a perfect world, CRM is
 Immediate — allowing your customers instant gratification, whether the
interaction involves processing a request or solving a problem
 Personalized — enabling you to tailor each interaction to your cus-
tomers’ unique needs and preferences
So, regardless of whether you’re selling dog collars or offering cleaning ser-
vices, CRM can help you make every customer encounter positive and
rewarding. And that’s good for business!
In the following scenario, we demonstrate how CRM technology, when imple-
mented well, can have a positive impact on cyberservice by creating satis-
fied, loyal customers. The interaction is a practical balance between
320
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

providing a set of personalized help options to the customer and maintaining
an efficient, low-overhead support process for the company. Here goes:
Imagine that you receive your monthly bank statement in the mail and
discover that your balance is less than you expected. You’re close to
being overdrawn. You look through your register and discover that a
deposit you made two weeks ago isn’t recorded. You do some of your
banking via the Web, so you access your checking account online by
entering your account number and password.
Customer profiling has provided the bank with a detailed understanding of
how you use its Web site and what information you’re usually seeking.
The bank has customized its presentation of your information by provid-
ing you with easy access to the functions that you use the most. Running
across the top of the screen are special introductory offers for invest-
ment opportunities to help with future education and schooling costs. By
crunching its stored customer data, the bank uses data mining to analyze
customer information and then look for spending patterns and common
demographic trends. This has shown the bank that given your age, income,
family situation (two young children), and zip code, you’re very likely to
be looking for investments that help cover your children’s educational
needs a few years down the road.
As you scan your online statement, you discover that the deposit isn’t
recorded there either. The Web site provides a Please Call Me button that
initiates an immediate telephone call back from the bank. You click the
button, enter your phone number and a few other details, and wait.
The request is automatically sent to a customer-service agent at the
bank’s call center who specializes in bank statement inquiries from the
specific customer segment to which you belong. The computer screen
that alerts the agent to call you also supplies him with your personal
information, your history with the bank, the reason for your call, and
what Web page you were looking at when you initiated your request for a
call back.
With the press of a button, the agent returns your call. You speak with an
agent, who, having all the relevant information in front of him, has an
immediate understanding of the situation.
The agent scans your other accounts and discovers the money was mis-
takenly deposited into your money-market account. He then corrects the
mistake and apologizes for the inconvenience it has caused.
The agent explains that, if you sign up via the Web, the first month’s fee
for the service is waived. You agree, he directs you to the site and asks if
you’d be willing to fill in a brief customer survey regarding your satisfac-
tion with the service you’ve received. You go to the survey page, fill in a
brief questionnaire, and then sign up for overdraft protection. The Web
321
Chapter 21: CRM: Automating the Personal Touch

pages explain the details about the service, how it works, and what it
costs. You fill in the application form and press the Submit button.
The following morning, to your surprise, you receive an e-mail from the
agent. He apologizes again for the mistake and assures you that every-
thing has been taken care of as promised. You’re impressed with the ser-
vice and, when you arrive at work, talk enthusiastically about your bank
and what a good job it does. You forget completely that it misplaced 
your money.
This scenario shows how you can effectively use the information you gain
through CRM to provide better service. The result? Satisfied customers.
You can gain a deeper understanding of how the balance between customer
needs and company benefits is achieved by taking a look at the scenario from
both sides of the equation — the bank and the customer.
Meeting customer needs
Assume that you’re the manager of the bank. You need to decide whether
your investment in CRM is paying off. Thinking about the earlier example,
you see that the integration of CRM technology and your commitment to
delivering excellent service have fulfilled a number of customer needs,
including:
 Personalization: With the information you gather through CRM, you can
tailor your customers’ experiences according to what they routinely
request. CRM helps you to predict what new products they’re likely to
buy or what concerns they’re likely to have. The bank has designed its
Web site to change its appearance according to the individual cus-
tomer’s unique usage patterns.
 Convenience: Everyone is busy these days, including your customers.
Always being accessible to your customers ensures that you’ll never
miss a business opportunity. In the bank scenario above, both the Web
site and a call center response are available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.
 Responsiveness: Whenever a problem occurs, most of us want to be
able to take action to resolve it. At the beginning of the scenario, the
customer is understandably concerned about the missing money.
Through a self-service Web interaction, he’s able to verify the most up-
to-date information and easily contact — by using the convenient Please
Call Me button — a service agent.
 Understanding: We all need somebody to lean on. The service agent,
through viewing pertinent data on his screen, is able to immediately
ascertain why the call has been made. As a result, the customer thinks
his situation is immediately understood.
322
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

 Expertise: When you have a specific question, you need a specific
answer. In the scenario, the call is routed to an agent who specializes in
the area of the customer’s query.
 Speed: Whether you’re purchasing a new sweater or solving a trouble-
some problem, in this fast-paced world, when you want something, you
usually want it now! Because the agent in the scenario is familiar with
the customer’s circumstances, he doesn’t have to ask the customer
questions to get up to speed with the customer’s issue.
 Resolution: Knowing that something is taken care of is always satisfying.
If customers feel like they’re in good hands, they’re much more likely to
stick with you as a customer. In the scenario, the agent resolves the
issue by seamlessly transferring the money to the correct account with-
out having to ask the customer for account numbers.
Reaping company benefits
One of the biggest benefits that CRM provides for a company is that it creates
happy, loyal customers. Yet other benefits to your company exist too, 
such as:
 Feedback: Whenever you can gain insight into your customers’ experi-
ences with your company, you have an opportunity to improve your serv-
ice. The customer in the scenario is delighted with the efficiency with
which the bank resolves the problem and willingly fills in a short survey.
 Up-selling: Offering an existing customer new services is more effective
on inbound calls. The agent uses the interaction in the earlier example
to better service the customer and to generate a new revenue stream for
the bank.
 Marketing No company can ever have too much exposure. During the
banking interaction above, targeted banner ads are displayed by the
bank and its third party vendors or partners.
 Referral: Hardly any better advertising exists than a satisfied customer.
The customer in the banking scenario was pleased with the overall expe-
rience and considers the bank to be very customer centered. He
becomes a walking referral.
Learning from CRM
No off-the-shelf, generic CRM template perfectly fits every company’s needs.
However, regardless of your organization’s size and future plans for CRM,
every savvy business person needs to understand the principles that are part
323
Chapter 21: CRM: Automating the Personal Touch

of its successful implementation. The following three areas are common
denominators among companies where online service is flourishing:
 Segmentation of the customer base
 Consistency across communication channels
 Developing a multichannel strategy
Although not every company is big enough to implement CRM, these three
elements can help any business offer better online customer service by
making products and services more customized and accessible.
Segmenting your customer base
Because of the newly developed ability to industrialize the trust- and loyalty-
building processes with customers, business people are required, as never
before, to analyze which customers they need to spend resources on and
which ones they shouldn’t. It makes sense to invest heavily only in the ones
who have a high probability of being lifelong and profitable customers. This
prioritization is the heart of customer segmentation.
A segmentation strategy is a three-step process that sorts customers who
meet the criteria you set for gaining a return on your investment. The criteria
may be based upon how much a client spends with your business in a year,
the average dollar amount the client spends per purchase, or the potential
growth rate of the client (which, in a business-to-business situation, signals
increased sales for your company). Segmentation then categorizes these
potential spending habits in a way that makes creating distinct customer
populations easy.
Each distinct customer population can be offered specific products and serv-
ices that may be too expensive to offer to your entire customer base. A simple
example is a company that offers free delivery to customers who purchase
goods of more than a certain amount. Another is the credit-card company
that offers you a lower-than-advertised rate because of your repayment his-
tory (and, no doubt, the strong possibility that you’ll use the card exten-
sively). Twenty percent of the CRM investments that companies make go
toward the loyalty-building aspects of profiling customers and segmenting
markets.
The 80/20 rule, which states that 20 percent of your customers are responsi-
ble for 80 percent of your revenues, is accurate for almost every business. If
you take this analysis one step further, the 1/10 rule reveals that about 1 per-
cent of your customers account for about 10 percent of your profits. These
numbers are a good place to start when segmenting your customer base
according to profitability.
324
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

Step 1: Sort your customer base into profitability segments
Select the customers from whom you’re making the most money. Say you
have a customer base of 5,000. Using the 1/10 rule, select the 50 customers
who contribute the most to your profitability. They are your premium cus-
tomers, and you’ll probably discover that you’re garnering most of their busi-
ness already. However, the true value of CRM is that it not only is about
getting more business from your customers, it’s also about finding ways to
better serve them and to deepen their loyalty to your company.
Here are some of the key traits of customers in this primary segment (other
than their contribution to your bottom line):
 They have the potential to become customers that you make an even
higher profit from.
 They are market-savvy and are interested in establishing strategic part-
nerships with their suppliers.
 They are profitable and financially sound.
 They are industry leaders.
Next, sort out the 40 percent of your customers from whom you don’t make
tons of money but who can become lucrative accounts with diligence and cul-
tivation. Creating a dialogue with these customers will more than likely give
you rich information regarding why they give some of their business to your
competitors. By discovering what they need in the way of service and prod-
ucts and supplying what they need, you help move them toward the most-
profitable bracket. For a company with 5,000 customers, approximately 2,000
customers are included in this secondary segment. Along with the key traits
for high-profit customers (see the previous list), medium-profit customers
also have these characteristics:
 They are innovative and flexible.
 The possibility for cross-selling is high.
 Your product or service is significant to their businesses.
 They show a trend toward increased revenues.
Next you deal with the customers that are marginally profitable. In the
sample customer base of 5,000, about 3,000 customers are in this category.
We believe that giving every customer the highest possible level of service is
important, and we think that good business sense requires you to carefully
consider who your premium customers are and, when appropriate, offer
them premium services that may be too costly for you to offer to smaller or
less-frequent buyers. In other words, the highest possible level of service
that you can give to an occasional customer who tends to pay you late and is
rumored to be going out of business probably isn’t real high. But for the big
accounts, the highest possible level of service means pulling all the stops.
325
Chapter 21: CRM: Automating the Personal Touch

After you know which customers you’re going to invest in, the next job is
finding out what they need from your organization — not only now but also
in the future. You discover this information as you implement the second
part of your segmentation strategy.
Step 2: Segment the markets and functions of your customers
The more refined your customer segmentation, the better able you are to
determine your customers’ specific needs and tailor your services to them. In
this second step, you initially need to segment the vertical markets of the
companies that you serve into categories such as:
 Financial
 Engineering
 Manufacturing
 Healthcare
Next, segment the specific customers from each of these markets into func-
tional responsibilities, such as:
 Executive
 Management
 Marketing
 Sales
 Clerical
 Accounting
Sort this list of individuals by their areas of responsibility, such as:
 Corporate
 Division
 Department
 Individual
By segmenting your customers vertically, you’re better able to hit the mark
when it comes to product design, marketing, and sales. For example, a training
company that has identified a large customer segment of corporate-engineer
managers, for example, may design and market a seminar that deals with the
specific concerns and issues that it knows are of interest to that group.
Step 3: Segment the habits of your customer base
Your customer database obviously is the central tool for CRM. New database
technologies such as data warehousing, which enables you to store informa-
tion in a single place, and data mining, which enables you to retrieve specific
326
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

information about your customers, have brought about a new sophistication
in forecasting what your customers want from you. Keep reading this section
for more about data warehousing and data mining. The purchasing habits of
your customers can partially be predicted by customer information such as:
 Previously purchased products
 Frequency and volume of purchases
 Zip code
 Gender
Online service presents a means for more comprehensive customer profiling
and data collection. Many companies now collect customer information that
helps provide a deeper knowledge of customers so that interactions are
smoother. These areas of familiarity may include
 How many times the customer has encountered a problem with a prod-
uct or service
 How many times a customer has called in or e-mailed a product-related
question
 How much working experience the customer has had with the product
 How many company-offered product-familiarity courses the customer
has attended
 The customer’s personality over the phone (chatty, curt, bitter-and-
twisted, and so on)
Although building your customer database is the beginning of the segmenta-
tion process, it is only the beginning. The average organization has about ten
separate databases, and these disparate systems need to be brought
together into one place — a data warehouse.
A data warehouse is a database that is used to store information that origi-
nates from the many different corporate databases and external market data
sources. Because of the way information technology has evolved, most com-
panies have different databases, in different formats, using different languages.
The process of bringing all this information together is data warehousing.
Given the need to have all departments (reception, sales, marketing, credit,
manufacturing, and so on) access and update the same customer information,
the data must be manipulated and cleansed so that it is consistent and compat-
ible with the format developed for the warehouse. After this consolidation has
taken place, special software programs can be used to sort through the data,
which otherwise is known as data mining. Data mining enables users to sift
through large amounts of data, using specialized software tools, to uncover
data content relationships and build models to predict customer behavior.
Predictive modeling can segment and profile customers, and that information,
if appropriate, can be integrated with other marketing-oriented applications.
327
Chapter 21: CRM: Automating the Personal Touch

Maintaining consistency across channels
The second element in assuring effective CRM is maintaining consistency
across communication channels. A channel is any avenue that enables you
and your customers to communicate with each other, including:
 The Web
 E-mail
 Fax
 Telephone
 Face-to-face meetings
CRM brings one of the most distinctive aspects of online service into sharp
focus — the multiplicity of channels. These channels are used for many dif-
ferent aspects of operating your business, including:
 Distributing information, such as the specifics on your product or ser-
vice. This information may include models, colors, characteristics, avail-
ability, the warranty, pricing, and service agreements.
 Communicating by answering customer inquiries about products and
services, for example.
 Making transactions, such as sending invoices and payments.
 Distributing products in innovative ways. Many software companies, for
example, allow you to download software directly from a Web site after
you’ve paid.
 Providing service through the many channels, which makes it easier for
your customers to connect with you.
Your organization’s reputation for being customer centered hinges largely 
on your ability to create a consistent service level regardless of what channel
your customer chooses. If you’re not convinced that you need to be strong
across all channels, consider this: Forty percent of online shoppers in a recent
survey say they’d use more than one route to obtain customer service. It isn’t
just phone calls anymore.
Many bricks-and-mortar companies that have moved into Web sales are
having a hard time serving customers across all channels. They aren’t in the
habit of keeping up with the details of customer interactions. One scenario in
which a customer gets bad service: A customer calls a catalog company
about a recent store or Web purchase only to be greeted by a service rep who
has no record of any previous purchases via other channels.
Although realizing that customers value consistency across all channels is
extremely important, the most successful online service providers also know
that different customer segments have different channel preferences. These
328
Part V: Working in a Wired World: Customer Service on the Web 

preferences can change depending on circumstances. For example, cus-
tomers who normally use the Web to ask questions will make a telephone call
if they need an answer quickly.
Developing a multichannel strategy
Although many different methods exist for developing a multichannel strategy
that suits your organization, it is wise to consult your different customer seg-
ments to discover their needs and their loyalty drivers — those things that keep
them coming back for more. A survey will help you capture valuable informa-
tion that can become the basis of your strategy. Three key steps are involved:
Step 1: Design a customer survey
Conduct a brainstorming session with key staff members to come up with a
list of interview questions. You may want to create a slightly different set of
questions for different customer segments. The following list can get you
started thinking about potentially useful questions:
 Do customers have access to the Web, or at least to e-mail?
 What is the customers’ preferred channel for receiving new product
information?
 What is the customers’ preferred channel for obtaining answers to ques-
tions regarding products or services not yet purchased?
 What are the customers’ invoicing and payment preferences?
 Do customers have concerns or feedback regarding privacy and security?
 What are customers’ preferred channels for technical support and prob-
lem resolution?
 How satisfied are your customers and what impacts their loyalty?
 What products or services do your customers not know about?
 What are the customers’ future spending plans and via which channel?
 What services would you need to supply to get a greater share of your
customers’ spending?
Keep your survey brief. Regardless of whether they’re responding to a live
person or filling in a form online, customers soon grow weary of answering
questions.
Step 2: Conduct customer interviews
After you develop the questionnaire, decide how the surveys will be deliv-
ered to your customers. The fastest and least expensive method undoubtedly
is by e-mail; however, because e-mail questions are so cut and dry, no oppor-
tunity is created for the in-depth dialogue that can, potentially, spin off from a
329
Chapter 21: CRM: Automating the Personal Touch

live conversation. For some of your clients, the expense and time of a live
interaction with an in-house person who has knowledge of the client’s history
may be worthwhile.
We recommend that interviews generally be conducted:
 Face to face for big accounts and accounts with great potential
 By telephone for medium-size accounts
 In writing for small accounts that probably will stay small
 By e-mail or the Web, an increasingly popular method that can be used,
if appropriate, with small- and medium-size accounts
Step 3: Use collected data as a basis for your strategy
The next step is to analyze the information that you collect from your sur-
veys and begin building a channel strategy. Your strategy will be unique to
your products and services and to your customers’ needs. Some things to
keep in mind include
 Some customers use the Web far more than others. Because Web inter-
actions require dramatically lower overhead than voice interactions,
many companies offer incentives for Web ordering. For example, airlines
may offer mileage bonuses, retailers an across-the-board 10-percent dis-
count, and so on.
 Many customers prefer a dialogue with a real person, which translates
into an agent-assisted telephone call.
 Some customers prefer an automated voice response system, so that
they can push buttons on their own telephone to get the recorded infor-
mation that they need.
 Everyone wants the option of switching channels when they require 
fast problem resolution. Companies that don’t provide alternative con-
tact information on their Web sites and e-mails score low marks with
customers.
When you consider CRM, keep in mind that its successful implementation is
as much a people process as it is a technology process. Having the right tools
without a top-down commitment to training and motivating staff is a recipe
for failure. As David Sims, a frequent writer on the topic of CRM, puts it, “The
worst scenario is when a company purchases CRM software, opens the box,
and then says ‘Okay, now what are we going to do with it?’”

topics that help round out your service education. The
Part of Tens is a quick and easy way for you to brush up
on the main points listed in this book — as well as a way
to pick up some new tips and techniques.
Finally, you, like most people, want to receive the same

Chapter 22
Ten Major Don’ts of 
Customer Service
E
very day you face situations when what you say to your customers
makes or breaks the service interactions. That’s why we decided to list
ten phrases to avoid here in this chapter — because they drive customers
nuts — along with our recommended alternatives for delivering the message
in a more polite and helpful way.
I Don’t Know
Switch to: “I’ll find out.”
When you say “I don’t know,” your customers often hear it as, “I don’t have
the information you want, and I’m not going out of my way to get it.” By offer-
ing to find the answer to your customers’ questions, even if doing so means
taking a little extra time researching or checking with another department,
you score service points for going the extra mile.
No
Switch to: “What I can do is . . .”
Inevitably, you sometimes have to say no to a customer’s request. Rather
than using what we call a hard no — where no options or alternatives are 
provided — focus on what you can do for your customers. By starting your
response with “What I can do is . . . ,” you show customers that you’re taking
a problem-solving approach to their particular situations.
Check out Chapter 14 for more about how to successfully say no to cus-
tomers when you have to.

That’s Not My Job
Switch to: “This is who can help you . . .”
When customers ask you to do something that you don’t have the authority
or knowledge to carry out, become a catalyst by leading the customer to the
person or department who can help him solve his problem.
You’re Right; This Stinks
Switch to: “I understand your frustration.”
Whenever a customer expresses annoyance at something another person or
department has done, don’t make matters worse by commiserating with him.
Instead of agreeing by saying something like, “You’re right, this place stinks,”
express empathy for the customer’s feelings by saying “I understand how
frustrating this must be.” Empathy is showing care and concern without
agreeing or disagreeing with what the customer is saying.
That’s Not My Fault
Switch to: “Let’s see what we can do about this.”
If an angry customer seems to be accusing you of creating a problem for her,
the natural reaction is to become defensive. However, if you allow that kind of
reaction to take over, your mind becomes closed to hearing what the cus-
tomer has to say. So when you find the words “That’s not my fault” on the tip
of your tongue, stop, take a breath, and then, with all the empathy you can
muster, say, “Let’s see what we can do about this.” By resisting the urge to
defend yourself, you can resolve the problem faster and with less stress.
Chapter 15 offers some great advice on dealing with angry and difficult 
customers.
You Need to Talk to My Manager
Switch to: “I can help you.”
Customers sometimes ask you for things that are a little outside of company
policy or procedure. At such times, quickly passing them off to your manager
is tempting. Instead, focus on what you can do to help them. If your manager
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

does need to be involved, take the initiative to go to him or her yourself and
return to the customer with a solution in hand. Doing so makes you the serv-
ice hero in the customers’ eyes.
You Want It By When?
Switch to: “I’ll try my best.”
When customers make demands by asking you for something that is unrea-
sonable and difficult to provide, your first reaction may be annoyance. How-
ever, because you have little control over your customers’ requests, the 
best approach is to hold off on any negative judgments and try your best to
accommodate the requests. Never promise something with only the hope
that you can deliver. Giving customers unrealistic expectations may get them
off your back in the short term, but it will blow up in your face later. Do make
promises that you know you can accomplish and assure customers, with con-
fidence and enthusiasm, that you know how important their deadlines are
and that you’ll try your best to meet them.
Calm Down
Switch to: “I’m sorry.”
When customers are upset, angry, frustrated, or concerned, telling them to
calm down is like saying that their feelings don’t matter. If you want your cus-
tomers to calm down, take the opposite approach and apologize. Apologizing
doesn’t mean you’re agreeing with the customers’ points of view or that
you’re admitting guilt, it means that you’re sorry for what has happened and
the negative impact it has had on the customer.
I’m Busy Right Now
Switch to: “I’ll be with you in just a moment.”
Stopping and assisting another customer who is asking for your help isn’t
always easy, especially when you’re already in the middle of serving a cus-
tomer. Some service providers handle this situation by tossing out a curt,
“I’m too busy right now” at the customer, which is their way of saying, “Why
are you bothering me, can’t you see I’m busy?” Stellar service providers use 
a better approach by saying, “I’ll be with you in just a moment.” This little
sentence, along with a pleasant tone of voice, tells your customer that you’re
aware of his presence and you’ll help him as soon as you are able.
335
Chapter 22: Ten Major Don’ts of Customer Service

Call Me Back
Switch to: “I will call you back.”
Some customer requests take time for you to research and investigate and
require a further conversation at a later date. Follow-up phone conversations
should always be initiated by you — not by the customer. When you’re so
busy that you’re tempted to ask him or her to call you back, stop, be proac-
tive, and take the initiative to call the customer back when you’ve taken care
of the problem.

Ten Tips for Constructive Conflict
with Co-Workers
In This Chapter
 Being assertive and dealing with conflicts directly
 Avoiding unnecessary negativity and judgments
O
ne significant difference between managing conflict with your co-workers
and managing conflict with your customers is that customers come 
and go, but your co-workers are here to stay (more or less). Managing con-
flict with workmates can be more difficult because you have more contact
with them, more often. All the skills you use to deal with difficult customers
(check out Chapter 16) work just as well with difficult co-workers; however,
you need a few additional skills when you’re having a hard time communicat-
ing with co-workers. Establishing good rapport and finding out how to resolve
conflicts with co-workers results in less stress for you and better service for
your customers.
Assert Yourself
If you don’t know how to strike that delicate balance between straight-
forwardness and tact, you can unintentionally create conflict. By flying off the
handle and becoming aggressive, you force your co-workers into a defensive
posture that makes hearing what you have to say difficult for them. The
opposite stance is also ineffective; being too tentative when presenting your
point may result in a co-worker not taking you seriously.

Knowing how to assert yourself can help you voice your thoughts, feelings,
and opinions in a nonthreatening and balanced way. Here are some important
tips on asserting yourself:
 Be specific. Make sure that you describe the situation in specific terms
so that the other person knows exactly what you’re talking about. For
example, saying “You don’t communicate” isn’t as effective as saying
“You didn’t call me when you said you would.”
 Stick to the facts. Don’t become a mind reader and assign reasons, atti-
tudes, or motives for why your co-worker behaved the way he or she did.
Your co-worker will become defensive if you make incorrect assumptions
about his or her feelings. Remember to describe only what is observ-
able. For example, saying “You felt so guilty, you couldn’t even look at
me” isn’t as effective as saying “After I spoke with you, you turned your
back to me.”
 Never say never. When you talk about the other person’s behavior, stay
away from absolute words such as “never” and “always,” because those
words usually are exaggerations of the facts. For example, saying “You
always ignore me” isn’t as effective as saying “You didn’t do what I asked
you to do.”
Handle Most Conflicts Face to Face
As we discuss in Chapter 12, 55 percent of the message that people receive
comes from body language. So although doing so may be more uncomfort-
able, dealing with conflict face to face whenever possible, rather than by
e-mail or over the phone, is usually more effective. If face to face isn’t viable,
because of distance or schedules, the telephone is the next-best choice.
Using e-mail to address conflicts is almost never a smart strategy, because
the lack of body language and tone of voice almost always guarantee misun-
derstandings will take place. Some simple yet important tips to remember
when managing conflict in meetings include
 Making eye contact. Let your co-worker know that you mean what
you’re saying by making direct eye contact with him. However, be care-
ful not to stare him down, because doing so can be interpreted as over-
bearing and aggressive behavior.
 Not fidgeting. Avoid nervous habits, such as pacing, tugging at your
hair, rattling change in your pocket, or tinkering with a pen. They are all
distracting and weaken the impact of what you’re saying.
 Letting your face reflect your feelings. Your face needs to reflect the
message that you want to convey. For example, if you’re angry, resist the
urge to smile and make light of the situation. In this case, a look of con-
cern is most appropriate.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Express Empathy for Other Viewpoints
A great deal of conflict can be nipped in the bud by providing your co-worker
with a brief and sincere expression of empathy. By letting the other person
know that you understand his or her point of view, even if you don’t agree
with it, you’re already halfway to resolving the conflict. Empathetic phrases
are a simple and easy way of conveying understanding. For example:
 I can see why you’d feel that way.
 I understanding what you’re saying.
 That would upset me as well.
 I know this is really frustrating for you.
 I’m sorry.
By using a genuinely warm and caring tone, you enhance the meaning and
effectiveness of empathetic phrases.
Avoid Fighting for the Last Word
Fighting for the last word is the vocal equivalent of dueling banjos. It usually
begins when your co-worker makes a remark that you don’t like, and you up
the ante by coming back with a snappy, even more disrespectful reply. The
other person takes offense and does the same back to you — only one better —
and you’re off! Before you know it, voices are raised, tempers are flaring, and
the conversation is spiraling out of control. The following conversation is
between Lauren and Jon, two systems programmers who share the same
work area in a large insurance company.
Lauren: I can’t believe you forgot to check the voice mail again.
Jon:
Oh, yeah, like you never forget to check it!
Lauren: Actually, it’s the first thing I do when I arrive in the morning.
Jon:
Well, you’re just so together, aren’t you?
Lauren: Why are you always in such a bad mood?
Jon:
If you don’t like the way I am, then don’t talk to me.
Lauren: No wonder nobody in the office likes you.
Jon:
I haven’t seen you winning any popularity contests lately.
If you find yourself in a conversation where things seem to be spiraling out of
control, you can pull yourself out by backing off. End the contest by letting
your co-worker have the last word. If you can drop your defensive posture,
339
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Constructive Conflict with Co-Workers

you’ll be able to listen to his or her point of view, discuss it, and then present
your ideas or opinions.
Rather than allowing the conversation to bounce back and forth with the
speed of a ping-pong ball, stay quiet for five seconds before you respond to
what your co-worker has said. A moment of silence usually gives you the time
you need to stop zinging back with an automatic, negative response.
Don’t Pretend Everything Is Okay
By burying your head in the sand and smoothing everything over, you fall
into the trap of convincing yourself that nothing is wrong and that no conflict
exists. On the surface, you seem to be avoiding confrontation with this strat-
egy, but in reality, the situation is a conflict waiting to erupt. Eventually, the
conflict will bubble to the surface when you least expect it. Here’s a conversa-
tion between Cliff and Alex. Cliff is Alex’s supervisor in the receiving depart-
ment of a large consumer electronics company. Alex has fallen behind
schedule but doesn’t want Cliff to know.
Cliff:
Did you inspect those amplifiers that came in yesterday?
Alex:
Yes. They look fine.
Cliff:
But some of the boxes haven’t been opened.
Alex:
Well, I’ve looked at most of them, and they were okay.
Cliff:
How many did you look at?
Alex:
Most of them.
Cliff:
When will you inspect the rest?
Alex:
Sometime today.
Cliff:
We’re expecting another shipment this afternoon, so all of them
need to be checked before the next lot comes in. This job is
really important, Alex, and I’m going to be very upset if it 
doesn’t get done.
Alex:
Don’t worry; no problem.
Alex is avoiding telling his supervisor the truth because he wants the prob-
lem to go away without facing it head on. Alex believes that the situation will
somehow miraculously fix itself when, in reality, it won’t. Avoiding the conflict
now only makes matters that much worse later when Cliff realizes that the
next shipment has arrived and the amplifier inspection still isn’t complete.
As soon as he knew that there was a possibility that his work would not get
done, Alex should have notified Cliff. By doing so, the potential conflict could’ve
been prevented and then a solution could’ve been reached for completing 
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

the inspection on time. Alex has another problem as a result of avoiding the
conflict: His stress level will climb steadily as the new shipment arrival gets
closer and makes focusing on his task more difficult and increases the possibil-
ity that unnecessary mistakes will be made.
If you find yourself in a situation where you’re tempted to pretend everything
is all right when it really isn’t, take the following steps:
 Don’t assume it will get better. Although hope springs eternal, the
chances of an uncomfortable situation just blowing over are unlikely, so
the sooner you come to terms with the situation, the sooner you resolve
the problem.
 Tell someone. Find someone who can help you resolve the issue and tell
that person exactly what is happening. He or she may get upset or react
in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable at first, but a few minutes of
direct heat is always better than several hours of slow simmering.
 Pat yourself on the back. After the situation is out in the open and
resolved, notice how much lighter you feel. Recognizing and reinforcing
that you had the courage to face the circumstances and deal with them
is important. Give yourself a pat on the back for taking the burden off of
your shoulders.
Look Below the Surface
In the previous example, Alex was avoiding conflict by pretending that every-
thing was okay when it wasn’t. His supervisor Cliff, on the other hand, has a
role to play. Cliff was too easily diverted from getting to the facts by Alex’s vague
answers. Be sure to ask specific questions to get to the truth of the matter when
dealing with a co-worker whom you suspect is saying things are okay when
they’re not. Both parties need to take action to keep from falling into this con-
flict trap. When you’re in a situation where you suspect another person is
smoothing over a problem to avoid a conflict with you, take these steps:
1. Ask general questions.
Asking general questions can help you probe a little deeper into what
the facts of the situation may be whenever you suspect that some
important information is being left out.
2. Ask specific questions.
Ask for details and don’t settle for answers that seem too vague or gen-
eral. Remember that when someone is holding something back, she
probably is doing so because she wants to avoid conflict, not because
she is dishonest. By keeping your tone soft and avoiding language that
makes it sound as though you’re accusing the other person, you make it
easier for her to face the situation and tell you what you need to know.
341
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Constructive Conflict with Co-Workers

3. Act, but don’t overreact.
Assuming that the other person hasn’t done something really bad, like
blow up the mainframe computer, most conflicts can be resolved by
simple communication. If you react by jumping up and down with steam
coming out of your ears, you make fessing up unsafe for the other
person the next time something difficult has to be dealt with. Instead,
after the situation has been put on the table and discussed, look for
mutual ways of resolving the problem.
Work with a Withdrawing Co-Worker
Withdrawal is a strategy some people use to keep conflict at arm’s length so
that it never has to be dealt with directly. The following conversation
between Amber and Manuel, co-workers in the credit department of an auto
parts company, shows what happens when one person withdraws from the
conversation and just doesn’t want to talk about the problem.
Amber:
Manuel, I really need your monthly statistics for my report.
Manuel:
(busy working at his computer) Later, okay?
Amber:
I need them today. This report is due soon.
Manuel:
I can’t do it now, I’m busy.
Amber:
I want them by lunchtime.
Manuel:
(getting up from his desk) I’ll see what I can do.
Amber:
(frustrated) This is the third time I’ve asked you for them.
Manuel:
(leaving the office) I have to go over to shipping, talk to me
when I get back.
Amber:
(loudly) You’re leaving? I can’t believe it! You never want to
deal with this problem or anything else!
Manuel:
(looking back as he leaves) There’s no point in yelling. I’ll
be back in an hour.
If you have ever been in a situation like this one, you know how frustrating it
can be. In this example, Manuel, for whatever reason, doesn’t want to give
Amber the time of day — or the statistics she desperately needs. Rather than
directly confronting the situation, he withdraws from it by only half listening
to what Amber is saying. Eventually, as she becomes more persistent, he
physically leaves the room to avoid the conflict.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

This conflict trap is difficult to manage, because if someone is really intent on
withdrawing from the situation, you can’t do a whole lot about it. However,
here are some ways of talking to a withdrawing co-worker that can help you
deal more directly with the situation at hand:
 Resist the urge to push. If a co-worker is starting to withdraw, resist the
natural urge to chase after the response you want. The more you push
your co-worker for an answer, the more he or she will pull back.
 Use an empathetic tone of voice. As you notice your co-worker begin-
ning to withdraw, change your tone from one of frustration to one of
understanding. Your co-worker always has a reason for not dealing with
the issue at hand. Using an empathetic tone is often all you need to get a
dialogue going.
 Seek out your co-worker’s advice. After your co-worker lets down his
guard a little, ask him what he would do — if he were you — to resolve
the situation. By doing so, you gently nudge him out of withdrawal by
helping him to be more sensitive to your predicament.
 Set a specific time. If the conflict can’t be resolved right away, set a spe-
cific, mutually agreeable date and time when you can sit down and
resolve the problem.
Avoid Serving Up Put-Downs
Verbal assaults used to invalidate the other person lead to conflict. Put-
downs can be a co-worker’s way of letting you know that she disagrees with
something you’ve done or said. Because she wants to avoid direct conflict,
she doesn’t talk to you about the problem. Slowly, her unspoken feelings turn
to resentment and eventually become outright attacks on your feelings,
thoughts, and general character. The following conversation takes place
between Mel and Betty, sales clerks at a retail furniture store.
Betty:
Did you notice that I sold the walnut bedroom set?
Mel:
All I noticed was the mess you made in the delivery book.
Betty:
(feeling put down) I’m sorry. The customers were newlyweds,
and they asked me so many questions I got confused.
Mel:
It’s a wonder you didn’t scare them away. You always seem so
put out when customers ask you a lot of questions.
Betty:
(hurt) What do you mean? I’m never rude to my customers.
343
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Constructive Conflict with Co-Workers

Mel:
You probably don’t realize it when you are.
Betty:
Mel, you’re the one who’s being rude.
Mel:
No. I’m just calling it like I see it.
Betty:
You’re so judgmental.
Mel:
See, there you go, you just can’t take any criticism.
In this situation, Mel has an attitude about Betty before the conversation
begins. No matter what Betty says, Mel uses it to find fault with her and inval-
idate her character and her achievements. The next time they speak, Betty
will hide what she’s really feeling, and the relationship between the two of
them will rapidly deteriorate. By not dealing with the original conflict (what-
ever it was and whenever it happened), Mel internalized his disagreement
and now it seeps out whenever an opportunity presents itself.
If you find yourself with a negative evaluation of a co-worker, remember that
your attitude is your responsibility — not your co-worker’s. Blaming the
other person for a situation that you’ve been unwilling to confront never
resolves anything. If, on the other hand, you’re on the receiving end of a co-
worker’s negative evaluation, as Betty was, don’t follow her example. Resist
the urge to respond with more negativity, and try to get to the real issues that
are causing the conflict. If you’re in a situation where your co-worker is
putting you down, do the following three things:
 Don’t get defensive. Defending yourself against a co-worker’s slurs
never resolves the situation, because it fails to get to the real issues that
are fueling the insinuations. You just end up feeling like a hamster on a
wheel, spending lots of effort going round and round and getting
nowhere.
 Be interested. Even though your co-worker is being indirect and may not
be expressing himself well, he does have something to convey. Try to listen
to the message underneath his negative evaluation and address that.
 Get to the root cause. Ask the other person whether something you did
in the past has upset him.
By taking these actions, the conversation between Betty and Mel would be
revised to sound something like this:
Betty:
Did you notice that I sold the walnut bedroom set?
Mel:
All I noticed was the mess you made in the delivery book.
Betty:
(feeling put down) I’m sorry. The customers were newlyweds,
and they asked me so many questions I got confused.
Mel:
It’s a wonder you didn’t scare them away. You always seem so
put out when customers ask you a lot of questions.
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Betty now realizes that Mel has a negative evaluation about her and that get-
ting defensive serves no purpose. Instead, she becomes interested in what
Mel is saying.
Betty:
What do you mean?
Mel:
I’ve noticed that you can be snappy with customers sometimes.
Betty:
Can you give me an example?
Mel:
You were snappy with me last week.
Betty:
I’m sorry. Have there been any other times when I’ve treated
you rudely?
Mel:
Yes, three months ago when I asked you whether you could
work a Saturday for me, you jumped all over me.
Realize Mood Affects Receptivity
Your mood affects how receptive you are to input. For example, when you’re
angry, your attention is narrowly focused on the person or thing that is
upsetting you. You probably have little room, if any, for input from another
source. So when someone speaks to you when you’re angry, you’re more than
likely unable to listen to or accept what he or she has to say.
The opposite is also true. When you’re in a good mood, you’re much more
open to receiving input. The point is, don’t approach your co-worker with a
heavy-duty conflict-laden topic when she’s in a bad mood, because you won’t
get the attention or receptivity you deserve.
Keep in Mind the Four Essential 
Truths of Human Interaction
Leading seminars for so many years has given us the opportunity to meet all
kinds of different people, and we’ve discovered (sometimes the hard way)
four basics truths that help you prevent unnecessary conflict:
 Different people have different working styles. Some people are pre-
cise and organized; others are vague and untidy. We all have different
working styles (see Chapter 13), and remembering this fact gives you
more patience and understanding with co-workers who think and act dif-
ferently. Understanding and respecting these differences can help you to
prevent conflicts caused by misunderstanding.
345
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Constructive Conflict with Co-Workers

 Be aware of your co-worker’s sensitivity. People get their feelings hurt
more often and more deeply than they usually admit. Often, something
said quite innocently can be taken as an offense by a co-worker. By being
more sensitive to the feelings of others, you cut down the number of
times you may inadvertently offend someone.
 You prefer some people over others. Don’t expect to like all your co-
workers equally. Some people you just click with, and others you don’t.
Chalk it up to chemistry. Conflict can usually be resolved by focusing on
having respect for your co-worker’s point of view instead of how much
you like him or her.
 You can’t judge a book by its cover. Sometimes you form a negative
opinion about a co-worker because of your judgments about the way
that person looks, talks, or where that person is from. If you get to know
the person on a deeper level, you usually find out he or she is nothing
like your mental picture. When dealing with other staff members whom
you don’t know well, be careful not to let the way they present them-
selves on the outside keep you from getting to know them on the inside.

Ten Ways to Get Better 
Service as a Customer
In This Chapter
 Expressing yourself effectively
 Keeping the service provider on your side
I
t’s one thing to know what makes you a winner in the service game, but
it’s another to know how to get what you want as a customer. Get ready to
switch gears and view life from the other side of the counter.
We’ve included this part on how to get good service in a book on how to give
good service because we’ve found that the more you stand in your customers’
shoes, the better you are at providing great service. The other reason is that if
you’re anything like us, you’re equally interested in getting the best service
you can when you’re the customer. With this in mind, here are ten ways to
making life on the other side of the counter less stressful and more successful.
Start Off on the Right Foot
When was the last time you walked into a department store and stood at the
counter waiting to be waited on? Two sales associates were in clear view and
were chatting away about their personal lives. Trying to be patient, you stood
quietly waiting for them to notice you and offer a helping hand. After a while
you started to think, “Do they see me, or are they still on break? What’s going
on here?”

How you initially approach service providers influences the entire interaction
and its outcome. Don’t let your time pressures or frustrations run away with
you. You want to give the message to the service people that you view them
as allies, not obstacles. Following are some easy and effective ways to convey
this message:
 Make direct eye contact as soon as you have their attention.
 Greet the provider by saying, “Good morning” or “Good afternoon.”
 Make a clear and direct request upfront, specifically stating what you
want (see the next section for more details).
 Make it clear that you need their help.
 Use the word “please” within the first 30 seconds of the exchange.
Ask for What You Want
One of the best ways to get what you want is to ask for it! The more clear,
concise, and direct you can make your request, the higher the chance that
the service provider can deliver it. One of the biggest mistakes customers
make is expecting the service provider to be a mind reader. Making clear
requests saves you time and lessens the service person’s frustration.
Following are important elements to include in your request:
 Know the end result that you want and don’t be afraid to ask for it.
Never assume the service person already knows.
 If you have a time frame in mind, let the service person know what it is.
 Make sure the person who’s helping you has the authority to do what
you’re asking.
 Be specific about any details that may vary from the norm.
Stand in Their Shoes
You may greet the sales clerks as warmly as you would your best friend, and
you may make the world’s clearest, most articulate and understandable
request, however, sometimes the people helping you can’t deliver 100 per-
cent. The reason may be because they’re simply having a bad day, or it might
be that company rules and regulations have put them in a bind.
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

We’ve trained more than 30,000 staff members in our workshops and find that
most people want to provide good service. The problem is that many people
work for companies that are in-focused (refer to Chapter 2). Unfortunately
these types of companies don’t support, encourage, or empower their staff
members to do what it takes to give you, the customer, great service. When
faced with this situation, the best strategy isn’t to shoot the messenger. Try
to understand the parameters that the person is working within and enlist his
help in getting through a system that you both probably feel doesn’t work.
If you need help solving a problem, use the resources of the service person
by asking:
 “What do you recommend?”
 “Do you have any suggestions?”
 “What would you do if you were in my situation?”
 “What’s a good next step?”
On those occasions when you’re dealing with someone who’s obviously in a
bad mood, try defusing the situation by recognizing their feelings and saying:
 “This situation must be tough for you.”
 “You’re doing a great job. I know this is a difficult situation.”
You can make life much easier for yourself, and at the same time help the ser-
vice person take better care of you, by doing one simple thing: Follow the
instructions you’re given. For example, if the form says fill out all the boxes,
then fill out all the boxes! Why reinvent the wheel? If you follow the instruc-
tions and you still don’t understand, ask for clarification. A minute you spend
paying attention now will save you 30 minutes later.
Express Yourself in Style
In the movie Network, Peter Finch’s character says, “I’m mad as hell, and I’m
not going to take it anymore!” One thing we can promise you is that sooner or
later, as a customer, you’ll get angry at some individual serving you, sometime,
somewhere. The range of your anger may be anything from mild annoyance 
to outrage. This anger is usually brought on by sheer rudeness, suffocating
bureaucracy, complete incompetence, or a combination of all three, in which
case you’ll see shades of red not normally visible to the naked eye. At these
times, the normal reaction is to pounce all over the service person (thinking
she deserves it) and treat her as badly as you feel you’re being treated.
349
Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Get Better Service as a Customer

Resist the temptation to pounce, and avoid the following:
 Threatening to sue as a tactic
 Yelling, screaming, or shouting
 Using foul language
 Threatening physical harm
 Claiming to know the owner of the company (when you don’t) and
saying that you’ll speak to him about the incident
If any of the above worked, we’d recommend them. Unfortunately, as many of
you know, they almost never do. More often than not, these strategies are
counterproductive because they put the service person on the defensive. She
becomes more interested in protecting herself than in helping you. The two
of you will get further away from problem solving and move closer to taking
opposite sides simply to avoid being in the wrong.
Sometimes you’re justified in feeling angry and expressing that anger. Just be
sure to express yourself in style, or as one of our friends says: “Stand up for
yourself in an elegant way by expressing your needs and concerns in as rea-
sonable a manner as you can muster.”
Use “I” Messages
Parent effectiveness training teaches that by using “I” messages, instead of
“you” messages, you can communicate your feelings honestly while minimiz-
ing the chance of putting the other person in a defensive posture.
“I” messages state feelings from your point of view and help to keep the other
person from getting defensive because you are talking about how you feel,
rather than blaming them. “I” messages begin, naturally enough, with the
word “I.” Examples include the following:
 “I feel frustrated that I can’t get the answer I need from your company.”
 “I don’t feel comfortable with the way this situation is being handled.”
 “I don’t feel I’m getting the help I need.”
By contrast, a “you” message states not what you’re feeling, but instead
states your opinion of the other person’s behavior.
 “You’re being very rude.”
 “You’re not being helpful.”
 “You don’t seem to know anything about this.”

Take Control of the Telephone
The telephone is more pervasive in our lives, as customers, than ever before. On
an average day, you may find yourself on the phone doing any of the following:
 Making a monetary transfer with the customer service representative at
your local bank.
 Getting help from the technical support department of a software com-
pany on the new word-processing program you purchased.
 Ordering an item from a mail-order catalog.
 Tracking down the package you sent overnight to Botswana that hasn’t
yet arrived.
 Setting up an appointment with your local cable company for service.
Take note of what to do when you’re faced with the following telephone 
situations:
 When asked to hold: When you call a company and the receptionist
asks you to hold, but you don’t want to, quickly respond by asking for
the name of the person you want to speak with, followed, of course, by
“please.” Odds are you’ll be transferred instead of being put on hold.
 When you’ve been on hold for a while: George Carlin, the comedian,
used to do a great routine during which he joked that “hold is a lonely
place.” If you’ve been on hold forever, consider hanging up and calling
back. Tell the receptionist how long you were waiting and ask if he can
take a message for the person you’re trying to reach.
 When you’ve been transferred around: Occasionally, you get a phone
tour of a company by being transferred to all the departments — except
the one you need. When this situation happens, ask to be connected
back to the operator. Tell her you were transferred to the wrong person,
and ask her to stay on the line until the transfer is complete. If she can’t
do that, ask for the direct number of the person you’re calling. If all else
fails, have the operator give the person you’re trying to reach a message
to call you back.
 If you get stuck with voice mail: If you can’t reach a real person (which
sadly happens all the time these days), try calling information and get-
ting the company’s main number. Ask for the fax number or e-mail
address of the person you want to reach and send him a message.
 If you’re playing telephone tag: If you find yourself playing telephone
tag, take advantage of the alternative technologies available. Try sending
the person you’re trying to reach an e-mail or, if you’re really desperate,
a fax. You can often get a quicker response this way. Another idea is to
leave a message on her voice mail system letting her know several, spe-
cific times when she can reach you.

Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Get Better Service as a Customer

Complain on the Spot
Okay, you smiled at the sales clerk when you approached her. You said please
and thank you when you asked the gate agent which black hole your flight
reservation disappeared into. You politely informed your waiter that you
ordered sweet potatoes not sweetbreads. Unfortunately, these approaches
have not worked. When all else fails, you may find yourself in a position
where making a formal complaint is the next step.
The first ears that your complaint will reach are probably sticking off of the
head of the service person you’re talking to. If, after hearing your complaint,
the service provider responds with a vacant stare or uncomfortable silence,
you may have an overwhelming urge to speak. Don’t. Learning to live with
that silence will pay off. The server will feel more compelled to respond if you
say nothing. This is the point when he is most likely to offer a suggestion or
an alternative. Or, he may run, scream in horror, and then go look for his man-
ager. If he does the latter, you can move your complaint up the corporate
ladder (see the next section).
Move Your Complaint up the Ladder
If you’ve gone as far as you can go with the person helping you, ask for a
supervisor or a manager. Don’t put the person on the defensive by saying,
“You’re obviously not the right person to take care of this situation, let me
speak to someone higher up!” A better approach would be to say: “I appreci-
ate everything you’ve done, but I want to speak with your supervisor so that I
can move this situation forward.”
This approach gives the service person a way to turn you over to her man-
ager without losing face.
Be prepared. If the person you’re dealing with has a bad attitude, the super-
visor or manager may be the same because the manager sets the departmen-
tal tone.
You have to walk a thin line when customers come to you and complain
about the service they’ve received from one of your staff members. On the
one hand, you need to support your staff person, and on the other, you 
need to empathize with the customers (see Chapter 15 for details on using
empathetic phrases). In this situation, never criticize your employees in front
of a customer and always apologize to the customer. Once the customer has
gone, use the complaint as an opportunity to educate your employee. Help
him see what he did right and how he could improve next time.
352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Write an Effective Complaint Letter
You want to believe that complaining to a manager is as high up as you have
to go in order to solve a problem. Usually it is. However, when it doesn’t pan
out that way, you may decide to write a complaint letter to the president, the
owner, or the executive of the company.
Complaint letters can be extremely effective in getting action if they’re well-
written and sent to the right person. The right person is usually the individ-
ual that has the power to do something about your situation. If you don’t
know who this person is, we recommend that you call the company’s head-
quarters or corporate offices. Once you reach a live receptionist, briefly tell
her your situation and ask for the person responsible for that area. If she
doesn’t know, ask to be transferred to someone who does.
Make sure you get the correct spelling of your contact person’s name along
with his or her title, address, and any necessary mail drop information.
Customers use the following two main styles in complaint letters:
 The venting frustration style. This getting-it-off-your-chest approach
may make you feel better, but it won’t produce the best results. In fact,
you may be taken less seriously by the person reading it. Figure 24-1 is
an example of this style.
As you can see by reading the figure, passenger Bob doesn’t need to
take a class in assertive communications. However, even though Bob
may have expressed his inner feelings and vented his frustration, not
much else has been accomplished.
 The action-oriented style. The second style of complaint letter aims not
only to express your feelings about the situation, but also to spark some
kind of action on the part of the company.
You need to consider eight important items when writing an action-oriented
complaint letter:
 Date of occurrence
 Time
 Names of those involved
 Your name and contact number
 Specific chronological events
 Your feelings
 Specific request for action
 Benefit to their company

Dear Mr. Smith:
Your company sucks.
I am appalled at the hideous service I received on my recent flight from

I feel that it is only fair to tell you that after this experience, I will never

Jackpot tipping
Jackpot tipping is a technique that we learned
from a friend on how to reward waiters and
waitresses who give you extraordinary service.
When you get the service that you expect, 
tip your server the standard 15 percent (or
whatever you consider standard). If you receive
substandard service, give him a reduced tip, 
say 10 percent. Now, here’s the trick: Take the 
5 percent difference and keep track of it (either
mentally or by jotting it down). For example, if
your meal came to $10 and the service wasn’t
up to par, you would tip 10 percent, or $1. The 
5 percent difference (50 cents) goes into the
jackpot. You keep adding money to the jackpot
until the next time you get extraordinary service.
Then the deserving waiter or waitress not only
gets his or her 15 percent tip but also hits the
jackpot and gets whatever has accumulated in
your jackpot account.
You could end up giving someone a $10 tip for a
$5 sandwich, but why not? Jackpot tipping is a
great way to vote for excellence in a way that’ll
be noticed.

tickets as an apology — NOT!

Mr. Jim Smith, President

Houston, Texas 94943
Dear Mr. Smith:
My name is Bob Johnston, and I am writing to inform you of my
experiences on a recent flight with your airline. For your
information, the flight was FA #101 from San Francisco to New
York on July 3, 1995.
I think that you would be interested to know that this flight did
not meet either my expectations for service or the level of
service I am sure you wish to deliver. Specifically, the following
occurred:
1. The plane was an hour late departing, but the gate agents
made no announcement until 30 minutes after the flight
was supposed to depart.
2. The ground staff underestimated the number of meals
needed on the flight, so there were not enough meals to
feed everyone on the plane. I, unfortunately, was one of
the passengers who received no meal.
3. The sound on the movie was not working.
While these may seem like trivial occurrences, they made my
flight very unpleasant.
As a long-time flier of your airlines, I found this level of service
unacceptable and am requesting a ticket refund. For your
convenience, I have enclosed a copy of my ticket receipt.
Please feel free to contact me at my office, ext. 7734, if you have
any questions. I look forward to receiving a response from you
before the end of this month.
Sincerely,
Bob Johnston

not always as fast to praise when we do. By praising good service, you
encourage those delivering it to keep up the good work.
Don’t limit your praise to the spoken word only. Putting your praise in the
form of a letter and sending a duplicate copy to the service person’s supervi-
sor is often beneficial. If you don’t know who her supervisor is, you can call
to find out. Or, send her two copies of the same letter with a request that she
forward one copy to her boss on your behalf.

Twelve tips for surviving the 
12 days of Christmas
While nothing may be further from your mind
than the next holiday season, we felt it appro-
priate to provide some guidelines for dealing
with what, for many, can be the most stressful
time of the year. Dealing with travel, shopping,
family and business obligations in a frantic two-
week period, can stress even the most placid
among us. You can enjoy the holidays and save
yourself a lot of time and trouble by following
some basic advice every busy business person
and savvy consumer should know:
1. Make a list of whom you need to buy pre-
sents for and from which stores. Being
organized will save you tons of time, money
and stress just by knowing ahead of time
who you want to buy gifts for and what 
you want to get them. Plan on spending a
set amount of time on a given day at the
stores on your list. If at all possible, go in 
the early morning or late afternoon and try
to avoid shopping on the weekends from
Thanksgiving through Christmas.
2. Shop by mail or online. Many catalog com-
panies will wrap your gifts, include a per-
sonalized card, and ship them directly to
friends and business associates. This is a
great way to get all your holiday shopping
done without ever leaving your house.
Likewise, today you have more choices
than ever about buying almost any gift you
could imagine on the Internet. Want a best-
selling book for your Uncle Neil? How about
that hot new CD for Aunt Nancy? All of this
and more can be purchased quickly with a
credit card and a few clicks of the mouse.
3. Stock up on basic items before the season
rush begins. This includes wrapping paper
and ribbon, tape, cards, and tags — even
candles and candy. The selection will be
better, and you’ll avoid having to fight the
crowds and wait in long lines for just a few
“small things.”
4. Call stores ahead of time if you’re going to
need special assistance. During the holi-
days, most stores bring in temporary work-
ers who don’t know the ins and outs of the
stores merchandise and policies and may
not be able to give you the special attention
you’ll need. If you need the assistance of a
knowledgeable sales person for a special
purchase, make an appointment ahead of
time by phone.
5. Prepare your grocery list for the “big” hol-
iday meal before you go shopping. Divide
the list by section and shop the store in that
order. If there’s a special item you’ll need,
call the store ahead of time to make sure it’s
in stock and ask them to hold it for you. If it’s
not in stock, ask them to special order it.

357
Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Get Better Service as a Customer
6. Make restaurant reservations three weeks
in advance of the holidays. Don’t leave
booking that special restaurant till the last
minute. Be sure to avoid problems by con-
firming all restaurant reservations at least
one day before. If you have special food
requirements, let the restaurant know this
when you call to make the reservation.
7. Plan on arriving 15 minutes early for
restaurant reservations. To avoid being late
and losing your restaurant reservation, plan
on arriving early. This allows for delays
caused by holiday traffic, parking prob-
lems, and so on. Be aware that most restau-
rants, especially at the holidays, will hold a
reservation only 10 to 15 minutes past the
time set.
8. If your flight is significantly delayed or can-
celed, don’t stand in line. Instead, use a
nearby pay phone or cellular phone to call
your travel agent or the airline. They’ll make
travel arrangements for you by phone much
faster than a harried gate agent with 200
other people in line with the same problem
to solve. In addition, we recommend that
you use a hard ticket during the holidays
and not an electronic one. If you need to
switch airlines at the last minute, you won’t
have to get the ticket issued by the original
airline first.
9. Ship gifts ahead of time. Why stress out
yourself and anger other passengers by
trying to stuff your gifts in an overhead 
compartment on a busy full flight? Instead,
save yourself the trouble by mailing all
packages to your final destination at least
two weeks prior to the holidays. If you have
to take last-minute gifts with you, wrap
them carefully and check them at curbside.
10. Always write down the name of whomever
helps you. This way, if there’s a problem
later on, after the holiday season, you’ll be
able to resolve it quicker when you can give
the name of the specific person who pro-
vided you with the information or a promise.
11. Use the knowledge of the service person to
help you solve your problem. If you need
help in solving a problem, ask the service
person “What would you recommend I do?”
and then stay silent. If you give them a
minute to think about it, they will often come
up with a workable solution.
12. Do business where you always do busi-
ness. Give your holiday business to the
restaurants and stores that you know and
that know you. An established relationship
formed throughout the year will almost
always lead to better customer service at
holiday times.
