IBM Cognos 10 Dashboard Components
6
IBM Cognos 10 BI is a bundle of tools that are accessible through a web interface and can be 
used for different sets of requirements. The following table briefly touches upon each of these:
IBM Cognos BI component name
Use case
Report Studio
Advanced report authoring interface where queries and 
calculations can be created manually. User needs to have 
BI designer skills. 
Analysis Studio
Interface to perform dimensional data analysis where 
an analyst can slice and dice data stored in the 
multidimensional format.
Query Studio
Business users can perform ad hoc data analysis. Simple 
queries are generated on the fly.
Event Studio
Used to managing data related situations and triggering 
actions based on specific data conditions.
Business Insight
Users can use existing components to assemble and 
distribute sophisticated dashboards.
Business Insight Advanced
Business users can author reports and dashboards 
in a way similar to Report Studio, but with much less 
complexity. Queries are generated on the fly and no 
manual creation of queries is required. It provides 
functionality that is a subset of Report Studio with an 
intuitive and easy user interface.
IBM Cognos 10 BI has introduced IBM Cognos Business Insight and IBM Cognos 
Business Insight Advanced, which are the two components that can be used to 
author and view dashboards.
IBM Cognos Business Insight is used to create sophisticated interactive dashboards from 
the existing content. For instance, assume a user has already created four different reports 
each catering to sales, marketing, HR, and finance, using Report Studio. Individual sections in 
these reports can then be used in IBM Cognos Business Insight independently, to create an 
interactive dashboard. This would mean that the dashboard can have a few charts from the 
first two reports, and a list and a crosstab from third and fourth reports respectively.
IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced is used to perform deeper analysis and report 
authoring where a user can perform more advanced data exploration, such as adding 
additional measures, conditional formatting, and advanced calculations. This can be thought 
of as a clipped version of IBM Cognos Report Studio, which is a complex report authoring tool 
in which queries and calculations can be built.
In this book we will be covering various aspects of IBM Cognos 10 Business Insight and IBM 
Cognos 10 Business Insight Advanced.

Readers are advised to install and configure IBM Cognos 10 BI and Samples (GO Sales and 
GO Data Warehouse), provided with the tool installation kit. For detailed installation and 
configuration instructions, please refer to IBM Cognos 10 BI Installation and Configuration 
Guide, shipped with the product.
Introducing IBM Cognos 10 BI Cognos 
Connection
In this recipe we will be exploring Cognos Connection, which is the user interface presented to 
the user when he/she logs in to IBM Cognos 10 BI for the first time.
IBM Cognos 10 BI, once installed and configured, can be accessed through 
the Web using supported web browsers. For a list of supported web browsers, 
refer to the Installation and Configuration Guide shipped with the product.
Getting ready
As stated earlier, make sure that IBM Cognos 10 BI is installed and configured. Install and 
configure the GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse samples. Use the gateway URI to log on 
to the web interface called Cognos Connection.
How to do it...
To explore Cognos Connection, perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to Cognos Connection using the gateway URI that may be similar to 
http://<HostName>:<PortNumber>/ibmcognos/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi.
2.	 Take note of the Cognos Connection interface. It has the GO Sales and GO Data 
Warehouse samples visible.

3.	 Note the blue-coloured folder icon, shown as 
 in the preceding screenshot. It 
represents metadata model packages that are published to Cognos Connection using 
the Cognos Framework Manager tool. These packages have objects that represent 
business data objects, relationships, and calculations, which can be used to author 
reports and dashboards.
Refer to the book, IBM Cognos TM1 Cookbook by 
Packt Publishing to learn how to create metadata 
models packages.
4.	 From the toolbar, click on Launch. This will open a menu, showing different studios, 
each having different functionality, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 We will use Business Insight and Business Insight Advanced, which are the first two 
choices in the preceding menu. These are the two components used to create and 
view dashboards.
For other options, refer to the corresponding books by the 
same publisher. For instance, refer to the book, IBM Cognos 
8 Report Studio Cookbook to know more about creating and 
distributing complex reports. Query Studio and Analysis Studio 
are meant to provide business users with the facility to slice 
and dice business data themselves. Event Studio is meant to 
define business situations and corresponding actions.
6.	 Coming back to Cognos Connection, note that a yellow-colored folder icon, which is 
shown as 
 represents a user-defined folder, which may or may not contain other 
published metadata model packages, reports, dashboards, and other content. In 
our case, we have a user-defined folder called Samples. This was created when we 
installed and configured samples shipped with the product.

Click on the New Folder icon, which is represented by 
, on the 
toolbar to create a user-defined folder. Other options are also visible 
here, for instance to create a new dashboard.

Click on the user-defined folder—Samples to view its contents, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
8.	 As shown in the preceding screenshot, it has more such folders, each having its own 
content. The top part of the pane shows the navigation path. Let's navigate deeper 
into Models | Business Insight Samples to show some sample dashboards, created 
using IBM Cognos Business Insight, as shown in the following screenshot:

9.	 Click on one of these links to view the corresponding dashboard. For instance, click 
on Sales Dashboard (Interactive) to view the dashboard, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 The dashboard can also be opened in the authoring tool, which is IBM Cognos Business 
Insight, in this case by clicking on the icon shown as 
 on extreme right, on Cognos 
Connection. It will show the same result as shown in the preceding screenshot.
11.	 We will see the Business Insight interface in detail later in this chapter.
How it works...
Cognos Connection is the primary user interface that user sees when he/she logs in for the 
first time. Business data has to be first identified and imported from the metadata model 
using the Cognos Framework Manager tool. Relationships (inner/outer joins) and calculations 
are then created, and the resultant metadata model package is published to the IBM Cognos 
10 BI Server. This becomes available on Cognos Connection. Users are given access to 
appropriate studios on Cognos Connection, according to their needs. Analysis, reports, and 
dashboards are then created and distributed using one of these studios. The preceding 
sample has used Business Insight, for instance.

Later sections in this chapter will look more into Business Insight and Business Insight 
Advanced. The next section focuses on the Business Insight interface details from the
navigation perspective.
Exploring IBM Cognos Business Insight User 
Interface
In this recipe we will explore IBM Cognos Business Insight User Interface in more detail. 
We will explore various areas of the UI, each dedicated to perform different actions.
Getting ready
As stated earlier, we will be exploring different sections of Cognos Business Insight. Hence, 
make sure that IBM Cognos 10 BI installation is open and samples are set up properly. We 
will start the recipe assuming that the IBM Cognos Connection window is already open on 
the screen.
How to do it...
To explore IBM Cognos Business Insight User Interface, perform the following steps:
1.	 In the IBM Cognos Connection window, navigate to Business Insight Samples, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

2.	 Click on one of the dashboards, for instance Marketing Dashboard to open the 
dashboard in Business Insight. Different areas are labeled, as shown in the 
following figure:
3.	 The overall layout is termed as Dashboard. The topmost toolbar is called Application 
bar. The Application bar contains different icons to manage the dashboard as a 
whole. For instance, we can create, open, e-mail, share, or save the dashboard 
using one of the icons on the Application bar.
The user can explore different icons on the Application 
bar by hovering the mouse pointer over them. Hovering 
displays the tooltip, which has a brief but self-explanatory 
help text.

4.	 Similarly, it has a Widget toolbar for every widget, which gets activated when the 
user clicks on the corresponding widget. When the mouse is focused away from the 
widget, the Widget toolbar disappears. It has various options, for instance to refresh 
the widget data, print as PDF, resize to fit content, and so on. It also provides the user 
with the capability to change the chart type as well as to change the color palette. 
We will see each of these options in detail when we visit Chapter 2, Business Insight 
Dashboards. However, all these options have help text associated with them, which is 
activated on mouse hover.
5.	 Content tab and Content pane show the list of objects available on the Cognos 
Connection. Directory structure on Cognos Connection can be navigated using 
Content pane and Content tab, and hence, available objects can be added to or 
removed from the dashboard. The drag-and-drop functionality has been provided as 
a result of which creating and editing a dashboard has become as simple as moving 
objects between the Dashboard area and Cognos Connection.
6.	 The Toolbox tab displays additional widgets. The Slider Filter and Select Value Filter 
widgets allow the user to filter report content. The other toolbox widgets allow user 
to add more report content to the dashboard, such as HTML content, images, RSS 
feeds, and rich text. We will see all these in more detail when we visit Chapter 2, 
Business Insight Dashboards.
How it works...
In the preceding section, we have seen basic areas of Business Insight. More than one user 
can log on to the IBM Cognos 10 BI server, and create various objects on Cognos Connection. 
These objects include packages, reports, cubes, templates, and statistics to name a few.
These objects can be created using one or more tools available to users. For instance, 
reports can be created using one of the studios available. Cubes can be created using IBM 
Cognos TM1 or IBM Cognos Transformer and published on Cognos Connection. Metadata 
model packages can be created using IBM Cognos Framework Manager and published on 
Cognos Connection.
These objects can then be dragged, dropped, and formatted as standalone objects in Cognos 
Business Insight, and hence, dashboards can be created.
The next chapter will explore Cognos Business Insight in more detail and we will actually be 
exploring the whole idea of creating dashboards using Business Insight and Business Insight 
Advanced, more deeply.

6.	 The Application bar area contains options to manage reports (for instance to create, 
open, and save a report). General options, for instance to cut, copy, paste, and delete 
are also provided in the same area. Specific options, which help the user to author 
and modify reports, are also present in the Application bar area. The same options 
are provided as icons on Toolbar.
Hover the mouse pointer over any of these options to display 
help text, which is self-explanatory and intuitive.
7.	
The Insertable Objects pane displays the metadata model package used to author 
the report. Components can be dragged-and-dropped from the package to the 
Report Authoring area.
8.	 The Toolbox tab has a list of static objects, which can be used to format the report in 
a certain way. For instance, a crosstab can be selected, dragged, and dropped to the 
Report Authoring area to build on the layout of the report.
9.	 The Properties window displays all the properties of the object that is currently 
selected in the Report Authoring area. The user can change properties of the report 
objects as required.
10.	 Click on the 
 icon from the Toolbar area to execute the report. The report will 
be rendered as HTML, in a new window called IBM Cognos Viewer, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

11.	 Dashboard pages can be designed so that URIs of such reports can be placed in the 
left-hand side pane. Configurations can be done to display the corresponding output 
on the right-hand side pane if a user clicks on the corresponding URI on the left-hand 
side pane.
12.	Such reports can also be directly used while creating dashboards in Cognos 
Business Insight.
How it works…
Cognos Report Studio has a similar interface to the preceding one, but is used to author more 
complex reports. Such reports created using Business Insight Advanced and Report Studio 
can be saved on Cognos Connection. These reports can be distributed to users as dashboards 
or as management reports.
Individual objects defined in these reports can be used independently in Business Insight 
to create more sophisticated dashboards. The advantage of such dashboards is that the 
summary data from various domains and functional areas, which is ready to be viewed in a 
user-friendly manner, can be collected and presented to users as one executive dashboard.
Going forward, we will focus more on creating the dashboards in the most efficient ways. Tips 
and relevant information about other related components will be shared throughout the book 
as and when required.
The next chapter will focus on Cognos Business Insight and some of the best practices in 
presenting business data to business users.

Introduction
In this chapter we will view existing dashboards in IBM Cognos 10 Business Insight. We have 
already seen different sections in the IBM Cognos Business Insight UI. We will learn how we 
can interact with dashboards in IBM Cognos Business Insight from a user perspective.
Opening a dashboard in IBM Cognos 
Business Insight
In this recipe we will open an existing dashboard. We will use samples provided with the IBM 
Cognos 10 BI setup.
Getting ready
IBM Cognos 10 BI Server should be up and the GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse 
samples should be installed and configured.

How to do it...
To open a dashboard in IBM Cognos Business Insight, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open Cognos Connection, using the gateway URI in a web browser. Navigate to 
Business Insight Samples, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Click on Recruitment Dashboard, which is the third entry in the screenshot. 
This will open the dashboard in Cognos Business Insight, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

3.	 The preceding dashboard is the collection of a crosstab and three charts. We will 
focus on each of the areas one by one in the next recipes. Take note of the rightmost 
area circled in red. It indicates that the section is collapsible. This is the subject of 
discussion for the next recipe.
How it works...
In this recipe we have used existing dashboards as part of the samples available with 
IBM Cognos 10 BI setup. The user is able to navigate to the dashboard through Cognos 
Connection. Clicking on the dashboard will open it, showing the latest data. Data is sourced 
from data source connections, already configured while installing the GO Sales and GO 
Data Warehouse samples.
The next section will focus on Cognos Business Insight in detail. We have already discussed 
this briefly in the previous chapter. Now we will analyze it in more detail.
Exploring the Content and Toolbox panes, 
and customizing the dashboard view
In the previous recipe we showed a vertical collapsible section, circled in red. Clicking on this 
section will open the Content and Toolbox panes, which we will see in detail now.
Getting ready
We will continue from where we left off in the previous section. We will click on the red-circled 
area on Recruitment Dashboard and analyze the Content pane first.

How to do it...
To explore the Content and Toolbox panes, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open Recruitment Dashboard in the Cognos Business Insight interface.
2.	 Shown in the following screenshot are the Content and Toolbox tabs. These are 
currently in expanded mode. They can be collapsed to hide the tabs, by clicking 
on the  button, which we had highlighted in the earlier recipe.
3.	 The Content pane can act as a navigator with which any other Cognos object can be 
viewed at any point in time. Any entry can be selected. Just right-click on that entry 
and click on the Open option from the menu. This will open the object in the same 
window. An entry can also be added to favorites by clicking on Add to My Favorites.

Users are advised to add all the objects they need frequently to 
their favorites/bookmarks in the web browser. This will save them 
from hassle remembering names on the Cognos Connection. This 
is important when you have a large number of dashboards with 
confusing names.
4.	 In the preceding screenshot, the Toolbox tab is circled in red. This is provided to 
enhance or filter data displayed on the dashboard. A user can right-click on the 
options listed in the Toolbox tab and click on Insert. The corresponding control 
on the Toolbox tab will be inserted and applied to the widget selected.
5.	 Click on the top-leftmost crosstab, which represents Recruitment by 
organization and department. This will highlight the crosstab, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
A widget is a component of the interface that enables a user to 
perform a function or access a service. The Widget toolbar can be 
used to change the behavior of the widget to a certain extent.
The widget toolbar is now available on the crosstab as we have 
selected the widget. This toolbar is specific to the widget selected. 
We will see the widget toolbar in more detail later.

6.	 Activate the Toolbox tab on the rightmost side. This will open the Toolbox pane. 
Right-click on Select Value Filter. From the menu options, select Insert, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
7.	
This will open a pop-up window—Properties – Select Value Filter. We will try to filter 
data here and limit what is being shown in the crosstab. Have a look at the pop-up 
window in the following screenshot. Let us analyze the pop-up window to see what 
options we have while applying a select value filter to the dashboard.
8.	 We can apply this filter to one of the widgets on the left-hand side Dashboard pane. 
Select a data item to filter on is the first section in the Properties – Select Value 
Filter window. Using this, a section value filter can be applied to one of the relevant 
data items, which is used in widgets. Hence, a data item and the corresponding 
widget can be selected in the section, so that the filter applies to the selected item.

9.	 For instance, in the preceding screenshot we want the filter to be applied to the 
Recruitment by branch widget. This is the bottom-leftmost widget, which displays 
Days to fill by branch (City). Underlying data item—City is used to display the branch, 
in the query.
Do not focus on how queries are coded in IBM Cognos Business 
Insight. Typically, queries are created using other components of 
IBM Cognos 10, such as IBM Cognos Report Studio, and used 
directly in IBM Cognos Business Insight.
10.	 The second section in the Properties – Select Value Filter window provides the user 
with the ability to select one or multiple actual values, and depending on that, the 
appropriate style can be applied to the filter.
11.	 In the preceding screenshot, let us assume that we want a user to be able to select 
a single branch from the set of radio buttons, and hence, filter the data appearing in 
the widget. The following screenshot shows the corresponding settings that need to 
be applied. Click on OK, once the settings have been applied.

12.	The third section, which is Optional, enables the user to provide a descriptive text 
with the filter, as shown in the following screenshot:
13.	The additional window is the filter we have just applied. One of the values can be 
selected and the Recruitment by branch chart changes accordingly. The filter can 
be removed by selecting the Remove from Dashboard menu item, which will delete 
the filter altogether and the widget will return to its original state. The Send to Back 
menu option will push the filter widget to the background but it remains applicable.

14.	 Clicking on Properties will again open the Properties – Select Value Filter window, 
which we saw earlier. It will help users to reconfigure the filter. Resize to Fit Content 
will adjust the size of the filter widget. Listen to Widget Events enables a user to 
configure one widget and change it according to the events in any other widget 
on the dashboard. Hence, the user can use data items used in one widget to filter 
data in another widget.
15.	Now let us use Remove from Dashboard to delete the filter and return to its original 
state. We want to explore other options in the Toolbox pane.

16.	 Another similar item to explore in the Toolbox pane is Slider Filter, which works in 
similar way to Select Value Filter. A slider filter when inserted in the dashboard 
needs to be configured first, using the Properties – A slider filter window, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
17.	 Here we want to apply a numerical range filter on a measure data item—Days to 
fill, which is applicable to all the four widgets. The From: and To: values can be 
configured manually, or else these are automatically set to lowest and highest 
value of the data item respectively.
18.	Let us change lower value from 26 to 50. This will change all the four widgets as the 
data item—Days to fill is used in all the four widgets.

19.	Similar to the slider filter, this filter can also be removed by clicking on Remove 
from Dashboard, resized by clicking on Resize to Fit Content, or pushed to the 
background by clicking on Send to Back.
In order to flip-flop the filter control from front to 
background and vice versa, click on the filter widget 
and chart/crosstab/list and vice versa.
20.	Let us remove Slider Filter to return to its original state. We will explore the remaining 
options in the Toolbox pane.

21.	 Other toolbox items such as web page, image, and text can be added to the 
dashboard. The user just needs to right-click and then click on Insert from the menu. 
A valid URL needs to be entered for the web page and image. The user can also 
configure target URL for an image to navigate to a URL when the image is clicked. 
Inserting text will open a text editor, so that user can format and insert required text 
on the dashboard.
22.	The last two options are My Inbox and RSS Feed. To display e-mails relevant to the 
business user, mail server options need to be configured correctly while installing 
IBM Cognos 10 BI environment. 
23.	Inserting RSS feed, requires the user to specify a valid URL for the RSS or Atom 
feed in the Type the URL address for the RSS or Atom feed field. Under the Options: 
section, three options are provided such as Show feed details, Show the feed icon, 
and Show alternating background, as shown in the following screenshot:
24.	 Do not change anything to Recruitment Dashboard, and keep it in its original state.
How it works...
In this recipe we have seen how a user can enhance/filter the dashboard view and customize 
it according to his/her own preferences. The dashboard can then be added to favorites and 
the user doesn't need to navigate and search all the entries on Cognos Connection for the 
required dashboard.
The next recipe will zoom in to widget controls and we will see how we can customize each 
widget independently. Options are provided so that users can format and customize each 
widget independently according to his/her own preferences.

Exploring widget controls and customizing 
widgets
In IBM Cognos Business Insight, the user can double-click on a widget or on the dashboard, 
and make the Widget toolbar visible. In this recipe we will explore the Widget toolbar.
Getting ready
We will use Business Insight Samples we have been following up in previous recipes. Let us 
navigate to Public Folders | Samples | Models | Business Insight Samples, on IBM Cognos 
Connection and click on the Marketing Dashboard link.
How to do it...
To explore widget controls and customize widgets, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open Marketing Dashboard. As can be seen in the following screenshot, the user 
has clicked on the Advertising cost chart, which has its own toolbar highlighted and 
circled in red. Every widget has its own toolbar, which can be brought to the front by 
clicking on the corresponding widget.

2.	 Let us now explore each of the options provided on the Widget toolbar.
3.	 Click on the Widget Actions icon, as shown in the following screenshot. The 
first menu item is Remove from Dashboard, which will remove the widget from 
the dashboard. 
4.	 Next menu option—Print as PDF will execute the chart and render it in PDF format. 
This can be printed and distributed as a hard copy.

5.	 The widget can also be exported to other formats such as Excel 2007 and Excel 2002 
using the Export to option.
Exporting a chart in the CSV format will actually download 
corresponding data, which is used to render the chart, in 
the CSV format. Hence, please remember that charts when 
exported as CSV will not have any graphical part rendered but 
will only have data in tabular format as shown in the following 
figure. This feature will help to debug data-related issues with 
the chart. 
6.	 There are options provided to maintain data in the chart. Different versions of the 
same widget can be managed and one of them can be used on the dashboard. 
Versions of the widget to be used can be changed by the user by expanding the 
Versions menu option.
7.	
Similarly, data appearing in the chart can be refreshed by clicking on the 
Refresh option.
The Refresh option is particularly useful when user wants to 
compare data before and after refresh. The same widget can 
be placed on the dashboard side-by-side. After the data feed, 
refresh only one of them to have new and old data side-by-side. 
This helps in comparing data before refresh and after refresh.
8.	 Listen for Widget Events… defines how the given widget will react to different events 
happening for other widgets on the dashboard. There may be a use case to drill down 
to a chart automatically when the user performs a drill action on another chart. This 
is useful to maintain the same context of information across all or more than one 
widget on the dashboard.

9.	 The size and visibility of the widget can be controlled by the next two menu options, 
which are Resize to Fit Content and Send to Back.
10.	 Clicking on Properties will pop up another window, which enables the user to define the 
title of the widget along with general properties, as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Take a look at the Report tab in the Properties window now:
12.	The Do More… option is provided to open the widget in a separate interface, which 
has more capabilities to manipulate the data and layout of the widget. Refer to the 
screenshot right after the following information box for an idea as to which interface 
pops up when the Do More… option is selected for the Advertising cost widget on 
the dashboard. 
The Do More… option gives additional actions to the user, which 
can be performed on the widget. A new window opens in the same 
window and when the user is done, he/she can click on Cancel or 
Done to return to the original dashboard.

15.	The first two icons denoted by 
, are meant for Redo and Undo changes. Their 
functionality is similar to what is already there in many popular word processing 
programs such as MS Word.
The user can hover his/her mouse on these icons for intuitive 
and brief help text that comes up as a tooltip.
16.	 The next section on the toolbar has icons—
 to filter data, 
 to sort data, and 
 to 
insert calculations.
17.	 Let us have a look at the filter options first. On another widget on the same 
dashboard, that is, Advertising cost by year, double-click on the crosstab to expose 
the Widget toolbar. Click on the intersection between Magazine advertising cost and 
Camping Equipment, and expand the filter menu as shown in following screenshot:
18.	The user can apply four types of filters based on the cell value. Select >840,274 
to apply a filter magazine advertisement cost less than 840,274. As this is true for 
Personal Accessories, we will see the output after the filter has been applied, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

19.	The 
 Icon can be clicked to see which filter and sort criterion has been set on that 
widget. Click on this icon, as shown in the following screenshot, to view the filters and 
sorting that are currently applicable to the Advertising cost by year widget.
20.	Close and open the Marketing Dashboard window again, without saving anything. 
Click on the Expand icon, as shown in the following screenshot, for the Advertising 
cost by year widget. Note that two filters — slider filter and select value filter, 
have already been applied to the widget. These are same type of filters we 
were discussing for the Toolbox pane in the previous recipe. 
21.	 Clicking on the Expand icon will open a small area displaying current settings in 
terms of filers and sorting, as shown in the following screenshot:

22.	Take a note of the first filter, which is set using the slider filter. This can be removed by 
clicking on Delete denoted by the 
 icon, as shown in the preceding screenshot, next 
to the specific filter.
23.	On the same widget, click on first column that is Camping Equipment, click 
on Sort By Label, and select Descending from the menu, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
24.	 Note the change in the order in which columns appear: 
25.	Newly added sort—Product line: Sorted by label, descending is visible in the menu, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

How it works...
This recipe is based on the GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse samples shipped with IBM 
Cognos 10 BI. The user, once logged on to a dashboard can play around with settings specific 
to a widget using a Widget toolbar. We have explored each option in this recipe and should 
now be able to explore further.
In Chapter 4, Creating Dashboards in IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced, we will see 
how we can drill up and drill down from master view to detailed view. A separate chapter is 
dedicated to drill functionality, which is quite useful in making dashboards interactive.
In the next recipe we will focus on the Application bar, which is at the top of the IBM Cognos 
Business Insight window.
Exploring the Application bar
In this recipe we will focus on the Application bar, which is placed at the top of the IBM Cognos 
Business Insight window.
Getting ready
We will use the GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse samples shipped with IBM Cognos 10 
BI. Ensure that IBM Cognos 10 BI Server is running and samples are set up properly.
How to do it...
To explore the Application bar, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open Cognos Connection and navigate to Public Folders | Samples | Models | 
Business Insight Samples.

2.	 Click on Revenue Data Dashboard to open it, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 We will explore the region circled in the preceding screenshot. This is the Application 
bar, which we briefly saw in Chapter 1, IBM Cognos 10 Dashboard Components.
4.	 The top-leftmost icon has menu items, which perform various tasks with the 
dashboard. Users can e-mail the link of the dashboard via mailbox using the 
Email Link... option, configured while setting up the IBM Cognos BI Server.

5.	 Click on Copy Link to Clipboard, and paste in a notepad to view the URL.
Dashboard authors can copy the link to clipboard using Copy 
Link to Clipboard and use the URL to navigate from a fancy-
looking frontend to the dashboard. Best practice is to design 
a fancy frontend in HTML/JavaScript and place links to the 
respective dashboard on the UI. Users can access all the 
dashboards from a single UI, and need not actually navigate 
on IBM Cognos Connection.
6.	 Click on Edit Dashboard Style… to open a pop-up window, which allows users to 
change the look and feel of the dashboard and widgets.
7.	
Similarly, My Preferences… allows users to control product language and content 
language. It also provides an option to set time zone information. These variables 
can be used to provide multilingual support. Product language will translate strings 
shown on the IBM Cognos Business Insight, while content language is used to provide 
multilingual support while displaying individual widgets.

8.	 Users can navigate to any other authoring environment, for instance to Report Studio 
using the Launch submenu.
9.	 All widgets can be refreshed with latest data simultaneously using Refresh All.
10.	 The options given in the following screenshot are also provided as icons on the 
Toolbar. Tooltips and help texts are provided, to make it convenient for the user:
11.	 The first icon is Create new dashboard followed by icons to open and save the 
dashboard. The icons for Email Link and Refresh All are also provided.
12.	Now we will see the Layout and Style icon, which is to arrange widgets on the canvas 
and to change the layout of the dashboard. Clicking on Layout and Style denoted by 
the 
 icon opens a submenu with following options:
Menu option
Usability
Icon in submenu
Fit All Widgets to 
Window
It sizes widgets in such a way so that whole 
window space on dashboard is occupied by 
the widgets. No empty space remains on 
dashboard window.
Arrange All Widgets 
to Fit Content
It sizes each widget just to ensure that the 
whole content is occupied. This may lead to 
lot of empty space on dashboard.
Edit Dashboard Style
It allows user to change look and feel of the 
dashboard and widgets. Background image 
and colors can be specified along with color 
scheme for widgets.
13.	The Insert icon denoted by

How it works...
In this recipe we have explored how we can play around with the look and feel of a dashboard 
as a whole in Cognos Business Insight. We have already set up samples that are shipped with 
IBM Cognos 10 BI. We used the samples to learn how effectively a user can play around with 
data on a dashboard.
The next chapter will focus on Cognos Business Insight Advanced UI. We will create some 
reports and will revisit Cognos Business Insight to use those reports and generate drill-up 
and drill-down functionality. We will also see how we can deploy and distribute jazzy 
dashboards, so that it is convenient for business users to access and play around 
with data.

Introduction
In this chapter we will look at the graphical user interface (GUI) of Cognos Business Insight 
Advanced. To reiterate, Cognos Business Insight Advanced is a web-based tool used to author 
reports and analyze data.
The advanced version enables business users to get an insight into their data without getting 
into the complexities of the Cognos Report Studio.
The reports created in Cognos Business Insight Advanced can be accessed in Cognos Report 
Studio as well. Independent reports created using Cognos Business Insight Advanced can be 
used in Cognos Business Insight to design and develop dashboards.
We will have a look at the interface of Cognos Business Insight Advanced, with which we will 
create custom reports on different set of data later in this book.
We will then use these reports, in Cognos Business Insight, to design a dashboard.

Opening a dashboard in IBM Cognos 
Business Insight Advanced
In this recipe we will open an existing dashboard created with Cognos Business Insight 
Advanced. We will use the GO Sales and Go Data Warehouse samples, which are shipped 
with IBM Cognos 10 BI setup.
Getting ready
Make sure that IBM Cognos 10 BI Server is up and running. The GO Sales and GO Data 
Warehouse samples should also be set up and working.
How to do it...
To open a dashboard in IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced, perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to IBM Cognos Connection and navigate to Public Folders | Samples | 
Models | GO Data Warehouse (query) | Business Insight Advanced, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
2.	 Click on the More… option, visible on the rightmost side of the Employees Expenses 
by Region report. It will open the Perform an action – Employees Expenses by

3.	 Click on the Open with Business Insight Advanced link, as shown in the preceding 
screenshot. This will open the report in Cognos Business Insight Advanced , as shown 
in the following screenshot. This is similar to opening a report in Cognos Query Studio 
where the report actually displays data, unlike in Cognos Report Studio where the report 
just opens up in the design mode without executing any query, and hence, without any 
data returned. We will now look at how to open the dashboard in the next step.

How it works...
In this recipe we have used our existing IBM Cognos 10 BI setup and have seen how we can 
navigate to Cognos Business Insight Advanced. We have seen key areas of its interface.
In the next sections we will focus on each of the components of Cognos Business Insight 
Advanced in detail. We will discuss what we can do with each of the features provided 
within the tool.
Exploring the Insertable Objects pane
In this recipe we will explore the Insertable Objects pane on Cognos Business Insight 
Advanced interface. The Insertable Objects pane contains objects that can be added to a 
report by dragging-and-dropping onto the work area. These objects form the basic building 
blocks of reports and dashboards.
Getting ready
Ensure that IBM Cognos 10 BI Server is running. We will use the GO Sales and GO Data 
Warehouse samples that are shipped with IBM Cognos 10 BI setup to complete the recipe.
How to do it...
We will now open an existing report in Cognos Business Insight Advanced and start exploring 
various features it offers on the interface. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to Cognos Connection and navigate to Public Folders | Samples | Models 
| GO Data Warehouse (query) | Business Insight Advanced. Open Employees 
Expenses by Region in Cognos Business Insight Advanced, as explained in the 
previous recipe. Shown on the rightmost side is the Insertable Objects pane, 
which contains objects that can be inserted on to the dashboard:

2.	 As shown in the preceding screenshot, there are two tabs on the interface. The tab 
on the left-hand side is called Source and the one on the right-hand side is called 
as Toolbox.
3.	 The Source tab displays the metadata model, which is the logical representation of 
the database tables and columns. Users can drag-and-drop these from the metadata 
model to the work area to create reports and dashboards.
A report created in Cognos Business Insight Advanced is tightly 
coupled with a specific metadata model. Each report can further 
have different objects such as charts, lists, and crosstabs. Cognos 
Business Insight can be used to design dashboards on top of 
these reports. Objects from different reports can be added to a 
single dashboard in Cognos Business Insight, irrespective of the 
metadata model used to create these reports. Hence, a user is 
presented with diverse data in the most convenient format, as a 
single dashboard.

4.	 For instance, we can expand the metadata model in the Source tab. Right-click on 
Expense unit quantity and click on the Insert option to drop the query item to the 
work area, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 The query item can also be inserted in the work area using drag-and-drop, instead of 
right-clicking on Insert.
External data can be imported and used along with enterprise data using the 
 icon in the Insertable Objects pane. External or personal data from data 
sources such as Excel, CSV, tab-delimited files, and XML can be imported 
to supplement enterprise data and used right away by importing external 
files, defining links between enterprise data and newly imported personal 
data, and publishing new external data packages. External data packages 
do not overwrite existing packages but include the existing original package 
along with new external data. By default, the new package is saved in the My 
Folders area of IBM Cognos Connection and appends External Data to 
the original package name. The user can change the location of where the 
package is published.
More detailed information regarding external data can be found in the product 
documentation and is out of the scope of this book.
6.	 The Refresh icon denoted by 
 is provided to refresh the contents displayed in the 
Insertable Objects pane. It is useful if the existing metadata model is changed and 
the author wants to use the latest version of the package.

7.	
Now we will look at the Toolbox tab in the Insertable Objects pane in detail. It 
provides list of objects that are provided by Cognos and can be inserted into the 
work area. These objects are different from the database objects, and instead, are 
different widgets provided by Cognos to format and organize data on the dashboard. 
Refer to the Toolbox tab, as shown in the following screenshot:
8.	 Objects available on the tab can be dragged-and-dropped to the work area. First icon 
on the tab is Text Item denoted by 
, which allows a user to insert strings on the 
dashboard for instance titles and subtitles.
9.	 Similarly, blocks and tables can be inserted on the dashboard using the Block and 
Table options respectively, to provide custom formatting.
Most of the objects available under Toolbox should 
be familiar to users, who already have experience of 
authoring reports in Cognos Report Studio.

10.	 Query Calculation denoted by 
 can be added to the dashboard to insert 
calculations based on existing query items on the dashboard or based on query 
items in the metadata package. For instance, in the current dashboard, dropping 
a query calculation would present to the user a dialog to form an expression, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

13.	An image can be inserted on the dashboard, by clicking on Image denoted by the 
 icon on the Toolbox tab. The user needs to browse and specify the location of 
the image.
14.	 The Crosstab Space and Crosstab Space (with fact cells) options from the 
Toolbox tab can be used to add a crosstab space and a crosstab space with fact 
cells respectively. Apart from the existing Crosstab icon, the List option is also 
provided on the Toolbox tab to insert a list. These are the different ways in which 
data can be shown to the business users:
15.	Charts can be added to the dashboard by dragging-and-dropping the Insert Chart 
option denoted by the 
 icon on the work area. There is a list of charts, which can 
be used on the dashboard. It is shown in the following screenshot:

Tooltips are provided for each of these charts. Help text becomes 
visible when the user hovers the mouse pointer over these chart icons.
16.	 Hyperlinks to other web content can be added to the dashboard, by dragging-and-
dropping Hyperlink, denoted by the 
 icon. The URL can be specified as a property 
of the hyperlink object. This helps in linking the dashboard with other web content, for 
example, web pages. The user needs to drop the hyperlink object onto the work area, 
right-click on the object, and click on Edit URL… to specify the URL, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

17.	 Constants such as date, time, and page number can also be added to the dashboard 
using the Date, Time, and Page Number icons respectively. Icons for each of these 
are provided on the Toolbox tab, as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works...
In this recipe we have seen various insertable objects available on the Cognos Business 
Insight Advanced interface. We have seen them in the context of the GO Sales and GO Data 
Warehouse samples, which we had already set up. The following table lists the features and 
uses of the Insertable Objects pane:
Feature
Use
Source tab
This contains the database objects represented in the form of logical model 
called metadata package. As a thumb rule, here, a table is called as a query 
subject and a column as a query item. These can be dragged-and-dropped to 
the work area to bring actual data on to the dashboard.
Toolbox tab
This provides list of objects provided by Cognos, which are used to represent 
the data from the Source tab in the required format. This further modifies 
look and feel of the objects and the way users can view data on the 
dashboard.
Now we will focus on other areas of the Cognos Business Insight Advanced interface. In the 
next chapters we will create our own custom dashboards. We will see how we can place 
different objects from different dashboards and arrive at a single view of data using IBM 
Cognos Business Insight.
Exploring the Properties pane
In this recipe we will explore the Properties pane on the Cognos Business Insight Advanced 
interface. Each widget we drag-and-drop onto the work area has a list of properties that can 
be set to customize its look and feel as well as behavior.
The Properties pane displays the properties for each widget we use to design the dashboard. 
For instance, a bar chart is a widget, which we might want to place on the dashboard. It has 
its own set of properties such as color palette and size, which can be adjusted, to customize 
its look and feel.

Getting ready
Ensure IBM Cognos 10 BI Server is started. The GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse 
samples should be configured on the server and working.
How to do it...
We will now open a sample report in Cognos Business Insight and explore the Properties 
pane in detail. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to the Cognos Connection and navigate to Public Folders | Samples | 
Models | Interactive Samples. Open Recruitment Report in Cognos Business 
Insight Advanced, as shown in the following screenshot:

2.	 The report shown in the preceding screenshot has been created using Cognos Report 
Studio. We have opened this report in Cognos Business Insight Advanced by clicking 
on More… | Open with Business Insight Advanced, as we have seen in the Opening 
a dashboard in IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced recipe.
3.	 Now we will explore the Properties pane at the bottom-right corner for different 
objects on the work area.
4.	 As shown in the following screenshot, select the Recruitment Effectiveness column 
bar chart, which will lead to the corresponding chart properties being displayed in the 
Properties pane, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 As we can see in the preceding screenshot, there are different properties visible in 
Properties – Combination Chart. Let us change a few of these to see how the view 
of work area changes in accordance to the Properties pane.

6.	 Let us change the Chart Orientation from Horizontal to Vertical, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
7.	
This will change the layout of the corresponding chart—Recruitment Effectiveness 
from Vertical to Horizontal, as shown in the following screenshot:
Different settings in the Properties pane are autoselected. This 
would imply that a property setting, when changed, causes the 
corresponding change on the work area on the fly. The user doesn't 
have to execute the report to view the effects of changed settings.
8.	 Now we will see another important setting—Value Location, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by john d mazzaferro on 14th August 2012
3005 wells rd, peconic, 11958

Business Insight Advanced Dashboard
68
9.	 The Value Location setting controls where the actual data values are displayed on 
the chart. For instance, in the current setting, values are displayed outside the bar, 
as we have selected the Outside top option. Let us change this setting to Inside top 
to display the values inside the bar, which should change the view, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
10.	 Another important property is to hide/show tooltips, which can be adjusted by 
clearing/checking the 
 icon. The Tooltips option, when enabled, will display 
values and other help text on the chart, or on mouse hover actions.
11.	 Similarly, other cosmetic features such as title, chart palette, font, background color, 
foreground color can be adjusted to customize the look and feel of the chart object 
on the dashboard.
12.	Now we will click on Crosstab and see its properties in the right-hand side pane:
This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by john d mazzaferro on 14th August 2012
3005 wells rd, peconic, 11958

Chapter 3
53
13.	Note that properties for a crosstab are different than that of a chart. We can 
adjust basic look and feel of the crosstab in terms of Border, Background color, 
Foreground color, Font, and so on.
Take a note of the 
 icon, on the Properties title bar, which can be clicked to 
view the hierarchy in which the current object falls. A higher-level object can 
also be selected using this.
How it works...
In this recipe we have seen how we can configure the setting of each object/widget on the 
dashboard independently. We saw how changing a few properties for a chart alters its look 
and feel on the work area. Similar options exist for other objects such as table, textbox, and 
list. Properties also vary across different type of charts.
The next recipes in this chapter will focus on other areas of Cognos Business Insight Advanced 
and how they can be used to create and customize dashboards.
Exploring the Application bar – general 
options
In this recipe we will explore another important area of Cognos Business Insight Advanced. We 
have seen similar explanations in previous chapter as well, in the context of Cognos Business 
Insight. In this recipe we will revisit and look at the kind of capabilities it provides on the 
Cognos Business Insight Advanced interface.
We will divide the Application bar into two areas for the sake of simplicity. First part will focus 
on the generic options that most word processors have. The second part will cover what is 
specific to Cognos Business Insight Advanced.
Getting ready
Make sure that IBM Cognos 10 BI server is up along with the GO Sales and GO Data 
Warehouse samples.

How to do it...
We will now open a report in Cognos Business Insight Advanced and look at the Application 
bar in detail. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to Cognos Connection and navigate to Public Folders | Samples | Models 
| Interactive Samples. Open Recruitment Report in Cognos Business Insight 
Advanced. We will focus on the Application bar in this recipe. It is circled in red 
in the following screenshot:
We have already visited most of this part of the Application bar while discussing 
Cognos Business Insight. In this recipe, we will primarily focus on its most important 
additional features.
2.	 The Application bar is provided with various options to manage the dashboard as a 
whole. For instance, options have been provided to create a new dashboard, open an 
existing dashboard, and save a dashboard. The first three icons 
 are dedicated 
to this functionality.

Do not forget to use mouse hover tooltips to get a quick hint 
regarding the icons on the Application bar.
3.	 Next are the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete icons denoted by 
 respectively, 
which are used to cut, copy, paste, and delete the objects on the dashboard. The 
Undo and Redo functionalities are also provided upon clicking 
.
4.	 Keep the report open as it is now, and proceed to the next recipe.
How it works...
In this recipe we have seen the general options on the Application toolbar, which are pretty 
common and can be found in any modern word-processing software.
In the next recipe we will focus on Cognos-specific options present on the Application bar.
Exploring the Application bar – 
Cognos-specific options
In this recipe we will learn more about the Application bar in terms of Cognos-specific options. 
We will proceed directly from where we left off in the previous recipe.
How to do it...
We will focus on the Application bar, circled in red, as shown in the previous recipe. It is 
assumed that we already have Recruitment Report at the location—Public Folders | 
Samples | Models | Interactive Samples opened in front of us, in Cognos Business 
Insight Advanced tool. To explore the Cognos-specific options of the Application bar, 
perform the following steps:
1.	 We can execute a dashboard in various formats by clicking on the 
 icon:

2.	 Data on the dashboard can be filtered using one of the options provided under the 
 icon. The user needs to select an object on the dashboard and click on the Filter 
icon to apply a filter in different possible ways, as shown in the following screenshot. 
Filters are used to limit the amount of data appearing on the 
dashboard, which in turn improves readability and performance. It 
helps to focus on just the dataset in which the user is interested.
3.	 For instance, let us apply a filter on the Recruitment Effectiveness column bar chart, 
by clicking on it and then on the Filter icon:

4.	 As shown in preceding screenshot, some options in the drop-down menu are disabled, 
as they are not relevant with respect to the Recruitment Effectiveness column bar 
chart. We will click on Create Custom Filter… to apply the filter to the chart. 
5.	 In the preceding screenshot we want to apply a filter that should only allow 
values greater than or equal to 35. In the Filter Condition – Days to fill dialog 
box, click on the OK button to apply the filter. The chart gets filtered, as shown 
in the following screenshot:

6.	 The same drop-down menu under the Filter icon can be used to edit filters by clicking 
on Edit Filters… and also to remove filters. A user just needs to ensure that the 
correct object on the dashboard is selected:
7.	
Click on Remove All Filters to reset the chart as before. Now we will apply a different 
text-based filter on the crosstab column, as shown in the following screenshot:

8.	 It will open a new dialog box, which we can use to create a filter condition. Note that 
this time the Filter Condition dialog box is different than what we had in the case of 
the chart, where we were applying a filter on numeric values.
9.	 Here we want the crosstab to show data only for Finance, Marketing, Operations, 
Sales, and Procurement. We will use  to select and deselect values and apply the 
filter, as shown in the following screenshot:

10.	 This should modify the crosstab, as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Again, the filters can be removed and edited using the same drop-down menu under 
the Filter icon from the Application bar.
12.	 More than one filter can be combined to further refine the data appearing on the 
dashboard. The user just needs to know which type of filter should be applied to which 
part of the object. Use 
 on the Properties pane title bar to select relevant object.
13.	Now remove all the filters we have applied so far. Close the dashboard and navigate 
to the Public Folders | Samples | Models | GO Data Warehouse (query) | Business 
Insight Advanced directory.
14.	 Open the Returns by Product brand report in IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced.
15.	The following screenshot displays a list on the dashboard showing the Returns by 
Product brand report. We have many products in this report for which we do not have 
Return quantity. If we wish to hide these rows from the current dashboard view, the 
Suppress functionality denoted by 
, which is available on the Application bar, can 
be used.

17.	 Click on Suppression Options… to learn more about this feature. Suppression refers 
to not showing those rows or columns or both, for which the selected widget has 
one or more of the conditions (stated in the right-hand side pane of the following 
screenshot) satisfied. By default, None is selected, and hence, no suppression is 
applied to the list. Let us select the list and configure Suppression Options to 
hide rows having zero values or missing values by selecting Zero values and 
Missing values under the Suppress the following section, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
18.	Click on the OK button to see the difference, as shown in the following screenshot. 
Clearly, the rows having missing values have been hidden or suppressed:
While applying any of the controls from the Application bar, do not forget 
to select the proper widget using the 
 icon on the Properties pane.

intuitive dashboards. Close all the windows without saving anything.
The user can also at any point in time, click on any of the widgets, right-
click, and choose from a set of options in a menu. These options are 
same as what we saw on the Application bar. We just have different 
ways to navigate and apply these options for different widgets.
How it works...
We have seen how to create a dashboard using the options on the Application bar. The 
options provide the user with the flexibility that he/she needs to view different aspects 
of data in a user-intuitive and visually appealing format.
Later chapters will focus on the drill-up and drill-down functionality and how a user can create 
dashboards from scratch. We will see how we can assemble widgets created in different 
studios and with different data to arrive at a single view, which can be delivered to users in 
desired ways, so that effective decisions can be taken in time.

Introduction
In this chapter we will create our first dashboard using Cognos Business Insight Advanced. 
We will use the sample GO Sales (analysis) package shipped with IBM Cognos 10 BI setup. 
We will use and explore the most important features that Cognos Business Insight Advanced 
offers while creating the dashboard.

Creating your first dashboard – defining 
basic layout
We will start by creating our first dashboard using Cognos Business Insight. We will save the 
dashboard and use its individual components in later chapters, to assemble enterprise-level 
dashboards using Cognos Business Insight.
An enterprise-level dashboard can display data from different sources. A 
report/dashboard created in Report Studio or Business Insight Advanced can 
be one of them. Business Insight can be used to design such enterprise-level 
dashboards by picking, for instance, a bar chart from report A, a crosstab 
from dashboard B, and a pie chart from report C. Graphical user interface 
provides flexibility to pick widgets from each of these reports selectively.
Getting ready
Make sure that IBM Cognos 10 BI Service is started and IBM Cognos Samples are installed. 
Log on to Cognos Connection.
How to do it...
To create a dashboard, perform the following steps:
1.	 Let us now use the GO Sales (analysis) package installed with samples and create 
our first dashboard. In this recipe we will define its basic layout. In subsequent 
recipes we will add more components to it.
2.	 Navigate to Public Folders | GO Sales (analysis). Click on Business Insight 
Advanced from the Launch menu, as shown in the following screenshot. It will 
open the metadata package in Cognos Business Insight Advanced.

3.	 Click on the Create new button as we want to create a new dashboard:
4.	 Click on the Blank icon to start with a blank dashboard. Click on the OK button to 
continue, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 Click on List, Crosstab, Chart, or Financial if you want to create a particular type of 
dashboard, which matches one of these in the layout. For instance, the List icon should 
be selected from the New dialog box to create a tabular-styled dashboard. This will 
open Cognos Business Insight Advanced, with a List object inserted by default.

6.	 Custom templates can also be defined, which when applied while creating reports 
and dashboards from the existing folder, will ensure that a common look and feel is 
applied across all reports.
7.	
The preceding steps will open the blank authoring environment in Cognos Business 
Insight Advanced.
8.	 Click on the 
 icon to define the layout of the page. Select the  icon from the 
drop-down menu to create four quadrants on the dashboard, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
9.	 Notice the Go Sales (analysis) package on the right-hand side under the Source tab. 
Query items can be dragged-and-dropped on the dashboard to define the data to be 
displayed on the dashboard.
10.	 Save the dashboard by clicking on the 
 icon on the Application bar. Save the 
dashboard by the name of 5825-04-Sample1.
11.	 Keep the dashboard open as we will be using it in the following recipes.

How it works...
In this recipe we have started with our first dashboard in Cognos Business Insight Advanced 
and have defined the basic layout, which will be applied to it.
We can now insert widgets in each of these quadrants to arrive at the final dashboard.
In the following recipes we will continue with the existing setup and insert content to our newly 
created dashboard.
Inserting a chart widget
In this recipe we will insert a chart widget to the newly created dashboard.
Getting ready
We will use the same setup that we started with in the previous recipe.
How to do it...
To insert a chart widget, perform the following steps:
1.	 We will now insert a chart in our dashboard—5825-04-Sample1. We already have 
the dashboard from the previous recipe open in Cognos Business Insight Advanced.
2.	 In the top-left quadrant, drop the 
 icon from the Toolbox tab. From the Insert 
Chart dialog box, select the Gauge chart, as shown in the following screenshot:

104
3.	 From the Source tab, drag-and-drop Expected volume and Products to Default 
measure (y-axis) and Gauge Axes respectively, as shown in the following screenshot. 
The idea is to show product forecast in the term Expected volume categorized by 
Products as plotted in the graph in the top-left quadrant of the dashboard.
4.	 Click on the gauge chart in the dashboard area and in the Properties pane 
define the title of the widget as Expected Volume by Products, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

105
5.	 Save the dashboard, which now looks like the following screenshot:
6.	 Save and keep the dashboard open for the next recipe.
How it works...
In this recipe we have inserted a gauge chart in the dashboard. Different types of charts are 
available under the Insert Chart wizard, as shown earlier in this recipe. It is always desirable 
to show the information in a chart format, which is easier to read and understand. Selecting 
the right type of chart is the key.
In the next recipe we will insert a crosstab in the existing dashboard.

Inserting a crosstab widget
In this recipe we will insert a crosstab widget in our dashboard—5825-04-Sample1.
Getting ready
We will use the same setup as in the previous recipe.
How to do it...
To insert a crosstab widget, perform the following steps:
1.	 In this recipe we will insert a crosstab showing Forecast revenue with respect to 
Products and Time in the bottom-right quadrant.
2.	 Drag a Crosstab object denoted by 
 from the Toolbox tab and drop it onto 
the bottom-right quadrant of the dashboard.
3.	 Drag Forecast revenue, Products, and Time from the metadata package under 
the Source tab and drop them to the center, top, and left-hand side area of the 
crosstab respectively.

more widgets to the dashboard and learn more about formatting features.
In the next recipe we will focus more on formatting features, which are available in the tool. 
We will also add other widgets to make our dashboard complete.
Formatting and arriving at the final layout
In this recipe we will add more content to our dashboard and learn more about 
formatting features.
Getting ready
We will use the same setup as in the previous recipe.

In this recipe we will learn how a user can drill up and drill down through hierarchies 
and levels.
Navigating from higher level of detail to lower level of detail is called drill down. In the same 
way navigating from lower level of detail to higher level of detail is called drill up.
For instance, year-quarter-month-day is a hierarchy with four levels. These levels are year, 
quarter, month, and day. A user viewing reporting figures for a year might be interested in 
navigating to individual quarters, which make up that year. Similarly, he/she may want to 
further drill down to the month level to see monthly level of detail.
In a similar manner a user currently viewing number at day level might be interested in drilling 
up to view monthly data and so on.
Getting ready
We will use the same setup as in the previous recipe and start with 5825-04-Sample1, 
which is already open in Cognos Business Insight Advanced.
To create drill-up and drill-down reports, it is necessary that the metadata 
package has dimensions and measures defined along with hierarchies and 
levels. This type of package is called as a DMR or dimensionally modeled 
relational package.
How to do it...
To perform drill up and drill down, go through the following steps:
1.	 We will now demonstrate the drill functionality using our newly created 
5825-04-Sample1 in Cognos Business Insight Advanced. On the Application 
bar expand the Data menu.

2.	 Select Drill Options…, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 It will open the Drill Options dialog box to configure drill options. Select the Allow 
drill-up and drill-down checkbox. This will allow a user to drill up and drill down if 
the underlying package is a DMR:
 
4.	 Save the dashboard. It is now drillable. We will now see how we can drill up and drill 
down in the report.
5.	 Let us consider the bottom-right quadrant, which is displaying Forecast revenue by 
Time for different Products. We have the stacked cone bar chart here, which has 
Time displayed on the y axis and Forecast revenue displayed on the x axis. This gets 
generated for different product lines, which is represented as a series. We will just 
focus on the cone for Time = 2006 here, as shown in the following screenshot:

6.	 Right-click on the caption—2006 and select the Drill Down option from the menu. 
Alternatively, user can also do a single left-click on the caption—2006 and it will drill 
down from 2006, that is, year level to quarter level.

7.	
The chart view gets changed with the y axis now displaying different quarters 
in 2006 and the Forecast revenue contributions shown for each product line 
change accordingly.
8.	 This can be drilled down further to month and day level, depending on which levels are 
defined for the Time dimension, in the DMR. We will now again right-click and choose 
the Drill Up option to return to year level, as shown in the following screenshot:

9.	 Similarly on the donut chart displaying actual Revenue by time and Product line, 
right-click on the legend Camping Equipment and click on Drill Down from the 
Product line level to Product type level.
10.	 The view changes accordingly to show the breakdown for Camping Equipment. Here 
we have performed drill down from Product line level to Product type level.

11.	 Again click on Drill Up to return to the original view.
12.	Save the dashboard and keep it open in Cognos Business Insight Advanced for 
the next recipe.
How it works...
We have seen how we can use the DMR package to perform drill up and drill down in 
the report.
We have dragged-and-dropped levels to the ppropriate areas in widgets on the dashboard. 
This enables users to navigate from higher level of detail to lower level of detail, based on 
the levels and their order defined while creating hierarchies. Similar is the case when a user 
wants to navigate from lower level of detail to higher level of detail, which is called a drill up.
Now we will see how we can apply formatting to various widgets placed on the dashboard 
based on certain conditions. This is known as conditional formatting.
Applying conditional formatting to the 
dashboard
In this recipe we will see how we can change the look and feel of various widgets placed on 
the dashboard according to certain conditions.
For instance, coloring crosstab cells based on the numeric values displayed within them, can 
be termed as conditionally formatting the crosstab widget.
Similarly while rendering bar charts, it is frequently required to show negative values as red 
color bars while positive values as green color bars. This recipe focuses on such use cases.
Getting ready
We will use the same setup as in the previous recipe and start with 5825-04-Sample1, 
which is already open in Cognos Business Insight Advanced.

How to do it...
In this recipe we will apply conditional formatting to our newly created dashboard—5825-04-
Sample1. Perform the following steps:
1.	 In the top-right quadrant of the dashboard, select the list displaying Year, Product 
line, and Quantity and insert two more columns from the Sales (analysis) 
namespace. The two additional columns are Planned revenue and Revenue 
in order and are dropped just after the Quantity column, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

3.	 Now we want to insert a calculated column at the end of the last column of the list. 
The new column will be ABS(% Diff(Planned Rev, Rev)), which will tell us by how 
much percentage Revenue differs from Planned revenue.
4.	 From the Toolbox tab drag the Query Calculation icon and drop it at the end of the 
list after the Revenue column.
5.	 In the Create Calculation dialog box, define the name of the new column. Also 
configure it to be a calculated measure by selecting the Calculated measure 
checkbox to be computed at Measure Dimension—Sales (analysis) | Sales, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

8.	 Clearly, the last column shows the absolute values of the percentage difference 
between what was planned and what is displayed in actuality.
9.	 Now we want to conditionally change the background color of the newly added 
column depending on the numeric range in which the column value falls.
10.	 Select the last column, that is, Abs(% Diff(Planned Rev, Rev)) and click on 
Conditional Styles…, as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Create a new conditional style by clicking on New Conditional Style…, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

How it works...
We have used our newly created dashboard and applied conditional formatting on top of that.
Changing the coloring scheme based on a condition is just one of the use cases, which can 
be achieved by conditional formatting. Objects can also be rendered and hidden based on a 
condition using conditional formatting.
In this recipe we defined a calculation based on the existing data in the list and colored the 
list cells in the column based on the numeric ranges in which the actual value falls.
At the end of this chapter we created our own dashboard and used various features provided 
in IBM Cognos Business Insight Advanced ourselves.
There's more...
In later chapters we will use the dashboard along with the existing sample dashboards to 
design more extensive dashboards in Cognos Business Insight. Unlike dashboards and reports 
created in Cognos Business Insight Advanced, such extensive dashboards are not limited to 
just a single package and can display data from multiple packages. This helps to provide a 
unified, pigeon-hole view of the enterprise-wide data, scattered across different domains and 
data sources.
Authors could create different domain-specific and package-specific complex reports and 
dashboards in Cognos Business Insight Advanced or in Cognos Report Studio. Individual 
widgets placed on them can then be used independently to design an enterprise-wide 
dashboard showing data across domains and packages.

Introduction
In the previous chapter we learned how we can create dashboards in Cognos Business Insight 
Advanced. We also saw the basic graphical user interface that Cognos Business Insight has to 
design dashboards.
In this chapter we will see how we can create dashboards in Cognos Business Insight using 
existing reports and dashboards.
We will use the already installed samples and the dashboard we created in the previous 
chapter on Cognos Business Insight Advanced.

Creating a dashboard in Cognos Business 
Insight
In this recipe we will be creating a dashboard in Cognos Business Insight. We will use 
the 5825-04-Sample1 dashboard we have created in the previous chapter on Cognos 
Business Insight Advanced and the GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse samples we 
have already installed.
Getting ready
IBM Cognos BI Server should be started. The GO Data Warehouse and GO Sales samples 
should be installed. 
How to do it...
To create a dashboard in Cognos Business Insight, perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to IBM Cognos Connection and create a new folder with name of IBM 
Cognos Business Insight Samples, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Navigate inside the newly created folder and open Business Insight from the Launch 
menu, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
145
3.	 Click on the Create New button to open the Cognos Business Insight 
graphical interface.
4.	 On the right-hand side pane, note the dashboard—5825-04-Sample1 that we created 
in the previous chapter on Cognos Business Insight Advanced. When we expand that, 
it shows the list of widgets that are placed on it. For instance, we have List1, Pie 
Chart1, and Pie Chart2 placed on the 5825-04-Sample1 dashboard.
5.	 When we drag-and-drop a widget on a dashboard, for instance a List on 
5825-04-Sample1, Cognos provides a unique name to that, for instance List1. 
Similarly, as we have used a pie chart at two places on 5825-04-Sample1, Cognos 
has named them as Pie Chart1 and Pie Chart2. The names given are specific to 
the dashboard.
6.	 These widget instances (for example, List1, Pie Chart1, Pie Chart2, and so on), 
which are shown in the Cognos Business Insight interface when we expand the host 
dashboard (for example, 5825-04-Sample1 listed on the right-hand side pane in the 
following screenshot), can be dragged-and-dropped in Cognos Business Insight, and 
reused to design new enterprise dashboards. The work area where the objects need 
to be dropped to create dashboards is called canvas, which has its left and centre 
areas empty, as shown in the following screenshot: 
7.	
Close the Cognos Business Insight interface and in Cognos Connection, navigate to 
Public Folders | GO Sales (analysis) to open 5825-04-Sample1 in Cognos Business 
Insight Advanced, as shown in the screenshot just after the next step.

8.	 Specify the title in the Properties pane for each widget. For instance, we provide 
Chart Title for the pie chart placed on the bottom-right corner of the dashboard, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
9.	 Similarly, provide a title for each widget. Save and close the Cognos Business Unit 
Advanced interface. 
10.	 In Cognos Connection, navigate to Public Folders | IBM Cognos Business Insight 
Samples and from the Launch menu, open Business Insight. Click on the Create 
New button to create a new dashboard.
11.	 On the right-hand side pane, notice the various objects available under 
5825-04-Sample1, each representing a widget instance we have placed 
on the dashboard.
12.	Right-click on Gauge Chart1 and then click on Insert, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

13.	This will insert the Expected Volume by Products chart on the dashboard, as shown 
in the following screenshot. The widget can be clicked to select, dragged, and moved 
to any available space on the canvas.
14.	 Save the dashboard as 5825-01-Sample2 at the location Public Folders | IBM 
Cognos Business Insight Samples. Navigate to IBM Cognos Connection to locate 
the newly saved dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot:

15.	Return to 5825-01-Sample2 and open that in Cognos Business Insight. Drag the 
Recruitment by department object from the Recruitment Success report, which is 
available at the location Public Folders | Samples | Models | GO Data Warehouse 
(query) | Business Insight Source Reports, and drop the object on the canvas 
beside the existing Expected Volume by Products chart, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
16.	 This will place the column chart on the canvas. Hence, it can be seen that objects 
from altogether different reports can be used to create a singular view easily. These 
objects can be formatted and presented to the users in the best possible format.

20.	The dashboard now looks like the following screenshot:
21.	 Save the dashboard and keep it open for the next recipe.
How it works...
In this recipe we saw how various objects that we already created can be reused to design 
a dashboard. 
Report authors can create reports and dashboards in Cognos Report Studio and Cognos 
Business Insight Advanced. Business users can log on to Cognos Business Insight and 
create their own dashboards simply by dragging-and-dropping the objects from already 
created reports and dashboards in Cognos Business Insight. They can be saved and 
distributed in different ways, which we will discuss in the later chapter.
Now we will apply filters to the dashboard we have just created. In later chapters we will 
also learn about ways in which dashboards can be accessed and distributed to different 
users and groups.

Applying filters in Cognos Business Insight
In this recipe we will apply filters to narrow down the data displayed on the dashboard. We will 
learn how we can limit the amount of data shown in the widgets by applying appropriate filter 
on each of them.
We will use the 5825-01-Sample2 dashboard we had created in the previous recipe.
Getting ready
We already have the dashboard—5825-01-Sample2, which we created in the previous 
recipe, open in the Cognos Business Insight interface. We have also saved the dashboard at 
the location Public Folders | IBM Cognos Business Insight Samples on Cognos Connection.
How to do it...
Now we will refine the data appearing on the 5825-01-Sample2 dashboard using filters 
provided on the Cognos Business Insight interface. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Toolbox tab. The various objects that can be inserted onto the dashboard 
are displayed, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Let us now drag the Select Value Filter object and drop it on to the canvas to open 
the Properties – Select Value Filter dialog box to configure the filter.

3.	 We want to apply a filter to the Planned vs actual chart and Baselines Chart. The 
filter would show list of years for which data has been consolidated and displayed 
in the charts. The user would be able to select one or more years under the Year 
section, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Note that the select value filter appears on the dashboard showing the list of years. 
All the possible values under the Year section, which can appear on the chart are 
shown in the preceding screenshot. These are distinct year values from the database. 
One or more of these can be selected or deselected to refine data based on which 
the two charts are then rendered.

 icon circled in red, which denotes that one or more filters are applied to 
the chart. 
6.	 Let us now select 2006 and 2007 from the Select a Year list prompt, click on Apply, 
and see how that changes the data displayed in the two charts:
7.	
Note the change in the numeric range in which the bars fall now. Save the dashboard.
8.	 We will now drag-and-drop another Select Value Filter object and apply it to the 
Expected Volume by Products gauge chart. The user should be able to select a 
product under the Select a Product section, apply it using the Apply button, 
and see the updated chart, as shown in the following screenshot:

9.	 Save the dashboard. We will now drag-and-drop the Slider Filter object from the 
Toolbox tab to the canvas. As shown in the following screenshot, configure the slider 
filter to apply that to the Recruitment by department column chart, so that user can 
select a range of values for Days to fill under the Data Item section:
10.	 Note that the custom range can be defined for the data item. Shown in the following 
screenshot is the slider filter when applied to the chart:

11.	 Let us now adjust the slider bar to filter the data appearing on the chart, with the 
Days to fill values in the range of 60 to 70. The chart changes accordingly. Save 
the dashboard.
12.	Now we have arrived at the final layout of our dashboard, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Note that each of these widgets can be dragged and moved to different 
areas on the interface, to rearrange and to give the desired look and feel. The user 
can also resize these widgets by dragging in or dragging out the widget corners.
13.	Keep the dashboard open for the next recipe.

How it works...
In this recipe we have used filter controls to refine the data appearing in various widgets on 
the dashboard. Different filters can be applied to different widgets, and hence, the user can 
choose to view data according to his/her preferences.
Best practice would be to group the filter close to the widgets it affects. 
This will avoid confusion, especially if the dashboard is not authored 
by the end user.
The next recipe will take a closer look at the widget controls and how each of these can be 
further customized independently.
Configuring widget controls to customize 
the dashboard
In this recipe we will customize the look and feel of the dashboard we have created by 
adjusting widget controls individually.
Getting ready
Keep the 5825-01-Sample2 dashboard we have created and worked upon in the previous 
recipes, open in Cognos Business Insight.
How to do it...
To configure widget controls to customize the dashboard, perform the following steps:
1.	 On the dashboard adjust the Days to fill slider filter for the numeric range between 
55 and 75, as shown in the following screenshot:

In this chapter we will learn about various modes of communication in Cognos, which can 
take place between different users, who have varying needs. This involves placing live news 
feeds from external sources on the dashboard, so that the information is broadcast to all 
the dashboard users. Users can collaborate with each other using the e-mail functionality 
provided in Cognos. We will also cover how we can share dashboard and reports among 
various users by placing Cognos content on portals.
The first recipe talks about collaboration among users using news feeds and e-mails.

How to do it...
To collaborate with other users, perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to Cognos Connection.
2.	 Navigate to Public Folders | IBM Cognos Business Insight Samples.
3.	 Open 5825-01-Sample2 in the Cognos Business Insight interface.
4.	 In the Toolbox tab we have the RSS Feed widget, as shown in the screenshot just 
after the following information box.
The RSS Feed widget is useful for saving or retaining updated

13.	Now we will move to the Email Link icon denoted by 
, which is available on the 
Application bar. It can be used to send dashboard links to other users.
14.	 The Email Link icon when clicked, will invoke the e-mail setup configured on the 
server and the dashboard link will be sent to other users through e-mail.
How it works...
We have seen three functionalities available in Cognos Business Insight that can be used in 
various ways to interact with other users as well as external sources.
While RSS feeds are commonly used to stay in sync with the latest changes in web content, 
My Inbox can be configured to receive the latest notifications and alerts.
We have also seen how users can e-mail the dashboard links to other people using previously 
setup mail clients.
The next recipe will focus on sharing reports and dashboard views, so that other users can log 
on  to Cognos Connection and view the data without navigating too much.
Sharing Cognos content – adding portal 
pages to Cognos Connection
Multiple portal pages can be added on Cognos Connection. On a portal page, IBM Cognos 
content (such as reports and dashboards), utilities (such as URLs and bookmarks), and 
third-party portlets can be added. Users can log on to Cognos Connection and view all 
the content placed on the portal pages directly, without navigating to directories and 
folder structures.
Security can be added so that portal pages can be made available to a group of users in an 
organization in a controlled manner.
In this recipe we will see how we can create a portal page, add content on it, and share it 
with other users.
Getting ready
Make sure that IBM Cognos 10 server is running. We will use the GO Sales and GO Data 
Warehouse samples to perform this recipe.

How it works...
We saw how custom portal pages can be created and added to the portal tabs. Cognos 
content can be placed on these portal pages in the required format and layout.
These portal tabs are made available to other users, who log on to the system and are 
unaware of the directory structure. They can directly click on the tabs and view the data.
Different types of content can be added to the portal tabs, which include RSS feeds, 
images, bookmarks, and HTML. Different portlets are available to be inserted on the 
tab for different content.
The look and feel of the portal tabs can also be customized according to user preferences.
Users can create and share the Cognos content with other users. Multiple portals can be 
created and added as portal tabs, each catering to a certain business function. Security can 
be defined on these portal tabs to ensure that only users from a particular business function 
can view these tabs.
Report authors and analysts can create and publish Cognos content to relevant portals, 
which can be used as a central place to share the related reports, dashboards, and views 
across different users.
In the next recipe we will focus on how different reports can be added as different tabs on 
Cognos Connection. This is another way of sharing Cognos content and it is helpful when there 
is a single report published with different views, each showing data for a different department 
or a business function.

Sharing Cognos content – adding reports as 
portal tabs
In the previous recipe we saw how a portal page can be designed and Cognos content can be 
placed on it to share it with other users.
In this recipe we will look at another way of sharing data. Here, we want to add certain reports 
as individual portal tabs, each of which should quickly provide a pigeon-hole view on a certain 
business area.
Getting ready
Make sure that IBM Cognos 10 server is up and running along with the GO Sales and GO 
Data Warehouse samples. Log on to Cognos Connection.
How to do it...
To add reports as portal tabs, perform the following steps:
1.	 In the IBM Cognos Connection window, navigate to Public Folders | My Portal 
and create a new folder with the name Potal Tab Reports, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

2.	 Navigate to Public Folders | Samples | Models | GO Data Warehouse (query) | 
Business Insight Source Reports and copy the Revenue Data, Marketing Data, 
and Promotion Data reports.
3.	 Paste these reports to Public Folders | My Portal | Potal Tab Reports, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
4.	 Now we want to have three different portal tabs for each of these reports. This will 
allow users to log on to Cognos Connection and view data regarding different subject 
areas directly in one place without navigating too much.
5.	 Let us now navigate to Public Folders | My Portal and click on the New Page icon 
denoted by 
 to create a new page.
6.	 In the Specify a name and description – New page wizard window, specify the name 
of the portal as Executive Portal under the Name section. Click on the Next button.

can view any of the subtabs under Executive Portal. He/she doesn't have to be 
bothered about which sources the data is coming from onto the dashboard. The user 
just needs to click on Marketing Data, Promotion Data, or Revenue Data to view the 
dashboard relevant to his/her area of interest.

How it works...
In this recipe we saw another way of sharing data across users. If this is clubbed with 
appropriate security settings, it will make sure that the relevant data is shared only with 
a corresponding set of users.
The next recipe will focus on making dashboards created in IBM Cognos Business Insight 
available to users, so that these can be shared and collaborated on.
Sharing the IBM Cognos Business Insight 
dashboard
In this recipe we will learn how we can create a portal page based on an existing dashboard 
created in IBM Cognos Business Insight.
This would help users to share dashboards that they created in IBM Cognos Business Insight, 
with other users by placing them on a portal page.
Getting ready
Make sure that IBM Cognos 10 BI server is started. The GO Sales and GO Data Warehouse 
samples should be set up and working. Log on to IBM Cognos Connection.
How to do it...
To share the IBM Cognos Business Insight dashboard, perform the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to Public Folders | My Portal.
2.	 Click on the 
 icon to create a new page. We want to put Sales by Year Dashboard 
shipped with samples on the portal page.

Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing highly focused 
books on specific technologies and solutions.
