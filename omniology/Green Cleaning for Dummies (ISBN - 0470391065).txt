About the Author
Elizabeth B. Goldsmith, PhD, is a Family Resource Management
professor at Florida State University who green cleans her own
home. A wife of 37 years and mother of two grown sons, Liz is a
nationally known expert in how households are run, including the
most documented home in America — the White House. 
Curators at the Smithsonian once told Liz they wanted to “put her
in a case” as an exhibit of a vanishing breed of home economists.
Liz enjoys teaching families at all stages of life how to demystify
home management. Her words of wisdom often include a heavy
helping of personal finance. She is sought after as an expert by gov-
ernment agencies and women’s organizations and is a frequent
guest on radio and TV programs.
Before it was hip to be green, people were learning from Liz how to
make their homes ecofriendly with style. For more than a decade
she wrote “House Calls,” a regular column in her hometown news-
paper.
Liz is the author of several college textbooks, including Consumer
Economics: Issues and Behavior (Prentice Hall; 2nd Edition Pearson)
and Resource Management for Individuals and Families (Wadsworth
Publishing), now in its 4th edition (Pearson). She was a Fulbright
Scholar in Trinidad and Tobago, studying family and home-
management practices. Liz presents papers on households and 
consumers at conferences worldwide and has been quoted in USA
WEEKEND, Chicago Tribune, Time.com, Denver Post, The Seattle
Times, The Orlando Sentinel, Google News, Chicago Sun-Times, San
Diego Union-Tribune, Washington Post online, and The Wall Street
Journal.

About the Contributor
Betsy Sheldon divides her writing and editing energies between the
topics of travel and the environment. She has served as editor in
chief for three travel publications, and is the author or coauthor of
six books on topics from job-hunting for women to Jewish travel.
She cherishes the memory of once having followed author Barbara
Kingsolver at an author’s book signing event — and actually attract-
ing a decent crowd of her own.
Betsy became a “born again” environmental activist because of Al
Gore, seriously, and is proud of her sustainably remodeled bath-
room, which uses reclaimed and recycled materials, sports low-flow
fixtures, and features a dual-flush toilet. Her home contains “recycle
cans” instead of trash cans, and her produce comes from the farm-
ers’ market, her CSA subscription, or her own garden.
Betsy writes “Green Watch,” a regular column for Indianapolis
Monthly Home magazine, and contributes articles about environ-
mental issues and sustainability to publications including Indiana
Living Green and Vacation Industry Review. She is involved in a
number of environmental initiatives, including the greening task
force for the American Resort Development Association and the
Indiana Sustainability Coalition, and also serves on the board of
Earth Charter Indiana. She facilitates “Low Carbon Diet” workshops,
which help participants discover the steps to lowering their own
carbon footprint and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Dedication
From Liz: To my daughter-in-law Jessica and to the rest of my
family, friends, and students whose life stories show me how
orderly homes can make happier lives. 
From Betsy: To Tatiana, Simone, and my grandson-to-be. May the
Earth I leave behind for you be one that you’ll be proud to pass on
to your grandchildren. 
Acknowledgments
From Liz: My work takes me into contact with so many inspiring
people it’s hard to know where to begin. Most of all, I’d like to
thank my family who gave me so much encouragement while writ-
ing this book. When the word went out, my sons and extended
family members (including many I haven’t met and look forward to
meeting) sent green cleaning recipes and how-to’s. I also want to
thank my friends Joan Bradley, Sharon Lynn, Leisa Flynn, Sue
McGregor, and Gale Workman, who explained how they clean and
what they find most effective.
I give huge thanks to the Wiley editors and staff: Acquisitions
Editor Mike Baker and Editor Kelly Ewing. They have been
absolutely wonderful to work with and have thrown in their clean-
ing tips, too. Betsy kept me focused on the greater ecological con-
sequences.
From Betsy: Deepest gratitude goes to the For Dummies team: To
Mike Baker and Joyce Pepple, for giving me the opportunity to
write about a topic I love — the greening part, not the cleaning
part. And to Kelly Ewing for her gentle and diplomatic editorial
guidance. Also, to Lynn Jenkins, whose knowledge and attention to
detail kept us honest. And to Liz Goldsmith, from whom I’ve
learned much about keeping a home to be proud of, and who
inspired me to finally organize my utility closet.
Special recognition goes to the many inspiring people in my com-
munity, devoted to furthering environmental awareness and action,
and who’ve given me guidance, not only regarding the content of
this book but on my own personal progress toward sustainability:
Ed Cohen, Bill Scott, JiaYi Chan, John Gibson, Todd Jameson, Bill
Brown, Doris Jane Conway, Mary Loe, Paul Chase, Vena Burriss,
Bob Proctor, Anne Laker, Leslie Webb, Sam Carpenter, Sam Miller,
and all the organizations and causes they champion.

Introduction
G
etting your arms around the global warming crisis can be
more than overwhelming. After all, what can you do to keep
the ice caps from melting? A significant change surely requires 
the commitment of greater powers — governments and big 
businesses, for example.
Most people buy into the belief that one person can’t possibly
have an impact on the environment. You are not one of those
people. By picking up this book, you’ve expressed a conviction
that the power to bring about change is yours, through actions as
simple as replacing light bulbs, adjusting the thermostat, carrying
your own shopping bag — and cleaning your home.
Even small changes in your housekeeping practices can add up 
to a big impact, not to mention personal pluses, such as saving
money, creating a healthier home, and discovering some really
cool cleaning tips.
About This Book
I wrote this book to help you achieve your goals, by showing 
you how to make your home a greener space. For the most part,
good housekeeping is synonymous with green housekeeping. The
fundamentals — to make a safe, clean, healthy, livable space — 
are the same.
My approach to green cleaning is downright practical. I talk about
toilets, trash, dust mites, dirty diapers, bird droppings, litter
boxes, festering bacteria, and insidious mold. Although I have a
PhD in human ecology (the updated version of home economics)
and researched housekeeping in the White House from the inside, 
I draw more on my experience of raising a family and managing my
own home, where relying on common sense has always been my
best strategy.
Sometimes, however, conventional cleaning wisdom and sustain-
able cleaning principles don’t completely mesh. In these situations,
I do my best to offer both sides of the argument. And I offer the
best green solution I know — or at least the solution that does the
least environmental harm.

This book presents green cleaning in its deservedly positive 
light — an activity that costs nothing or next to nothing, reduces
energy consumption, makes your home a healthier place, requires
no fancy gadgets, and reaffirms that going green is not about 
sacrifice or doing without, but rather a celebration of values that
bring about a meaningful, fulfilling, and joyful quality of life.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you find information quickly, here are a few style 
conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis.
 Web site addresses appear in a typeface, called monofont,
which makes them easy to recognize.
 Key words and phrases are in bold print to stand out.
What You’re Not to Read
The sidebars (those shaded gray boxes) provide background that
helps you understand the “why” behind a suggestion. Sometimes,
they present a green activity — composting, for example — that
takes green living to a new level. Skip them, if you like. You can also

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into four parts, with 14 chapters and an
appendix. Like all For Dummies books, each chapter is self-
contained so that you can jump in wherever you like without
having to read from beginning to end. For example, if you want to
start mixing up cleaning solutions, dive right in at Chapter 6.
That said, the book does have a logical sequence, and the 
following sections give you a good idea of what you find in each 
of the four parts. (Or check the Table of Contents and index to
chase down topics of interest.)
Part I: A Greener, Healthier 
Way to Clean
This part sets the stage for cleaning green. It defines what it means
to be green and why embracing a more sustainable lifestyle is 
critical. You get a big-picture view of the reasons green cleaning 
is important and discover how green is connected to clean. You
also find out how greening your housekeeping style can bring you
benefits, from better health to bigger savings.
Part II: Getting to Work
The most important steps in cleaning your home come before 
you even pick up your dust mop. In this part, I help you lay the
groundwork for easy green cleaning, by starting with hints on
avoiding housework. I also tell you how to assemble your cleaning
hardware and stock the utility closet. Finally, you discover some
great homemade cleaners that you can mix up in the comfort of
your kitchen.
Part III: Cleaning Green, 
Room by Room
Each room contains its own unique cleaning challenges, and Part
III addresses green cleaning solutions room by room. You discover
what you need to know to tackle the kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms,
and living room. I even take on the laundry, the never-ending task,
giving you a kinder, gentler way to get your clothes clean, while
saving water and energy.

Your living space doesn’t stop at the front door. People are spend-
ing more time outdoors, and to get there, they pass through foyers,
mudrooms, sunrooms, and the garage. Just because these areas
are outside — or on their way — doesn’t mean that you can skip
cleaning them.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book contains a Part of Tens. And in this book,
the part is packed with quick bits of practical, applicable, and
easy-to-implement hints for making your home — and your life —
greener. Pick and choose to darken your shade of green as it works
best for you.

today’s to-do list? Turn to Chapter 9 for the dirt on the cleanest,
greenest wash. Just getting ready to do the dishes? Chapter 7
addresses your “dishwasher-or-by-hand?” quandary.
Although I share recommendations and advice from some of the
top green and clean resources available, what you take away from
this book is entirely up to you. Everyone is at a different rest stop
on the journey toward green. And everyone’s circumstances —
home size, the time available to clean, cooperation of family 
members — are different.
That you’ve taken the step to read this book is something to cele-
brate. What you choose to do first, how quickly you choose to
make changes, and how much you’re willing to take on is all up to
you. No judgment. You may embrace the energy savings that come
from turning down the thermostat, reducing washer temperatures,
and using the dishwasher less frequently. But you may not be
ready to hang your wash outside on the clothesline or cut your
shower time to five minutes. That’s okay. Navigate the possibilities,
and not only improve your home environment, but contribute
toward a sustainable future for the world.

Part I
A Greener, Healthier
Way to Clean

In this part . . .
S
ometimes, the connection between housekeeping and
keeping the ice caps from melting isn’t easy to see.
But even your choice of laundry detergent has an impact
on the environment, and it’s bigger than you may imagine.
In fact, you can lighten your “footprint” on the planet in a
fairly signiﬁcant way simply by changing the way you clean. 
In Part I, I explore the links between climate change and
changing the sheets. I share what reducing your carbon
footprint is all about, and how your journey toward a
healthier planet starts at home. I show you how convert-
ing to greener cleaning practices affects air pollution
(indoors and out), water safety, and waste reduction. 
You also discover how approaching your housecleaning
with an ecosensibility leads to tangible beneﬁts for you:
better health, lower energy bills, and the feeling of satis-
faction that you’re contributing to a better world.

Chapter 1
Cleaning House in a 
Brave Green World
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the connection between clean and green
 Embracing a new way of cleaning
 Cleaning green throughout the house
 Adapting green cleaning to your unique world
P
aper or plastic? Dishwasher or sink? Dry-clean or hand 
wash? Tap water or bottled water? Carpeting or linoleum? 
As citizens of the world attempt to navigate the complexities of
environmental responsibility, more questions than answers 
surface, especially regarding sustainable practices in the home.
The choices can be tricky. Sometimes the solution that seems the
most green isn’t.
Take grapes, for example: Organic grapes seem the greener 
choice, at first blush. True, organic growing methods don’t rely 
on chemicals or processes that require fossil fuels, which cause
the greenhouse gas emissions that add to climate change. But
when your grapes are shipped from Chile, the petroleum savings
are gobbled up by the energy cost to get them to your store. The
grapes grown locally are, while not certified organic, the more 
sustainable choice.
Contemplating the green angle definitely adds layers of complexity
to the simplest of tasks: shopping, eating, cleaning the house. I
intend to peel away some of those layers, to help simplify your
already complicated life, at least in terms of housecleaning. By
exploring the world of cleaning in an ecological manner, I show you
that you can have a clean house, and green it, too.

Waking Up to a New Awareness
No doubt about it: What happens in Peoria affects Patagonia. And
Paris. And Punxsutawney. The water wasted in Scranton hurts 
villages in the Sahara. The traffic congestion in Atlanta warms the
ice caps in the Arctic. If only it were true that what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas. But people there and throughout the world
are waking up to the fact that their actions can affect the climate,
damage the planet, and use up stuff you may really want to keep.
How you clean has an impact on the environment, too. Greening
the way you mop your floors may seem like a drop in the bucket,
but each small change accumulates into a larger stream. Maybe
you can’t save the Antarctic penguins this morning, but you can
hold off running the dishwasher until you have a full load. Action
by action, you can make positive changes.
Your housekeeping practices intersect with big-picture ecological
issues at many junctures. Look for these connections:
 Plugging petroleum consumption: Plug in, turn on, flip the
switch, press the button. Your home’s appliances, tempera-
ture control, operating systems, and even water delivery all
run on energy generated by fossil fuel. Petroleum is also a 
critical component of most plastic containers, which hold
everything from ketchup to tile cleaner.
Modifying your cleaning routine — decreasing the number of
laundry loads, updating old, inefficient appliances, and even
turning down the temperature on your water heater — can
play a big role in reducing your household energy consump-
tion. In Chapter 2, I cover all the places you may find “oil” in
your cleaning closet. And throughout the book, I offer alterna-
tives to energy-intense cleaning methods, whenever possible.
 Clearing the air: Not only do many home furnishings and
materials include petroleum, some forms can cause harm to
the environment and to you and the inhabitants of your 
home, contaminating water systems and emitting unhealthy
chemicals. Blame it on paint, particleboard in cabinets, vinyl
flooring, and carpeting and upholstery, but air quality in the
typical American home can be worse than the outdoor air.
Commercial household cleaning products are also culpable.
Chapter 3 spells out the worst offenders.
 Blocking the drain on water: You thought oil was in short
supply. Water is being depleted at an alarming rate, through
drought, pollution, and commoditization by big business
interests. Changing your cleaning habits helps reduce your
contribution to water shortage: Using energy-efficient washing
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
10

machines, taking shorter showers, and using your disposal
less all help. This book is packed with tips for conserving
water: Chapter 2 addresses the energy cost that water carries.
 Taking out the trash: Landfills climb ever higher, as the world
population continues to consume. Cleaning practices can 
contribute to the problem. Choosing reusable dust cloths
over paper towels or throwaways; being mindful of the pack-
aging that accompanies new cleaning products; and even 
purchasing cleaning appliances designed to last help reduce
your contribution to the waste stream.
Cleaning green is good for the planet, but it’s also good for you. As
you begin making changes to your housekeeping practices, you’re
certain to discover the following benefits:
 Better health: Removing harmful chemicals (found in many
conventional cleaners) is bound to improve air quality in 
your home, thereby having a positive effect on the health of
its inhabitants.
 More savings: Energy-efficient appliances, although some-
times more costly upfront, mean you spend less on energy
and reduce water usage. You gain even more savings when
you simplify your cleaning arsenal with homemade recipes
concocted from common ingredients that cost pennies 
compared to commercial cleaners.
 Deeper commitment: Cleaning green can be one of those
“gateway” experiences that lead to a heightened awareness of
other ecoconscious practices. Every green step you take ele-
vates you to the next level, where you discover yet other ways
to make sustainable changes to your life and to the world.
Gearing Up for a New Clean
Making changes, even small ones, takes some preparatory work.
And figuring out your plan of attack is an important step when
launching your new clean-green assault. Here’s what you need 
to do:
 Employ better tactics. One of the cornerstones of sustain-
ability is to avoid the need to consume resources and expend
energy: If you can take a bus to work, for example, why buy a
car? With cleaning green, a great place to start is to consider
the stuff you have to clean. A white carpet takes more effort
to maintain than a tile floor. Dry cleaning is more costly (from
environmental damage to personal budget) than washing at
home. You get the idea.
Chapter 1: Cleaning House in a Brave Green World 11

This advice parlays to housekeeping in a bunch of ways: from
implementing routines to prevent your home from getting
dirty (taking off your shoes at the front door), to recognizing
that you don’t need separate cleaning formulas for each 
surface and room in your home. Chapter 4 presents pointers
that help you avoid housework — or at least reduce its 
intensity and frequency — and outlines routine maintenance
issues, such as servicing your furnace regularly, that keep
your home systems running efficiently.
 Stock better tools. Choosing tools and cleaning aids that 
do the least amount of damage to the environment is 
another important component of sustainable cleaning. Mop
systems, for example, are a great convenience for modern
housekeepers. But their throwaway mop heads are a green
strike against them. Single-use wipes, likewise, are wasteful
when an old towel or diaper can do the job again and again.
Simplifying your tools — gathering a few that serve many pur-
poses rather than dozens that all perform a single specialized
task — and investing in durable items that last are steps for
greening your utility closet. Find lots more in Chapter 5.
 Switch to better ingredients. Cleaning formulas made of
petroleum-based chemicals may rid your home of undesirable
elements (dirt, mold, grime, germs), but may introduce
unhealthy chemicals into your home. If the same cleaner that
kills the germs that were making you sick now emits a fume
that makes you sick, are you really ahead?
An easy and inexpensive way to reduce the fossil fuel in 
your cleaners is to make your own with common household
items such as vinegar and salt. Some of the recipes found in
Chapter 6 take just seconds to make and can clean a host of
household surfaces.
Going Green Room by Room
Your home is packed with a multitude of cleaning and greening
challenges. And Part III walks you through them, room by room,
even addressing your outdoor “living room.”
Although I cover each room separately in a chapter all its own, 
you find recurring situations and challenges throughout your
house. All rooms have floors, for example. Some rooms share 
similar surfaces — tile, porcelain, stone. And many rooms are 
furnished with wood. So while I thoroughly cover the cleaning
highlights for each space, I may direct you to another chapter for
further detail.
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
12

For example, flooring types are covered in some detail in the 
chapters about the kitchen (Chapter 7) and the living room
(Chapter 11), so in Chapter 10 (bedrooms), I sweep through floor
cleaning as it pertains to the bedroom, but direct you to the other
chapters for more detail about flooring materials.
The variety in home design is virtually infinite. Region frequently
dictates whether a home includes a basement, an attached garage,
or a separate dining room. Family circumstances may determine
the choice of a home office or nursery. And personal interests
might mean that an extra bedroom becomes a library, a fitness
room, or a meditation area.
I don’t include chapters for every possible dedicated space a home
may shelter. But you can be sure that the particular needs of such
rooms are addressed in one of the chapters. For example, you 
can read Chapter 11, which features the living room, if you want
pointers on green cleaning a den, a basement furnished as a family
room, or a library.
Taking Green to the Next Level
Green doesn’t stop when you put the broom away. Sometimes it’s
helpful to understand how other pieces of the green-home puzzle
play into your housekeeping efforts. How you shop, eat, travel,
work, and socialize — at some level, they all make their way into
your home.
Chapter 14 suggests ecoconscious steps you can take beyond
cleaning, from how you use (or don’t use) your car to insulating
and weatherizing your home to buying local food. But helpful 
information and valuable tips are packed into every chapter. For
example, in Chapter 7, you find out about composting your kitchen
scraps, making good use of what would have been thrown out 
and feeding your garden. In Chapter 10, I talk about buying organic
sheets and tell you about the greenest pillows available.
Cleaning is a form of creative self-expression. You and I probably
approach cleaning in a totally different style. I fly through my
house; my cleaning routine is so familiar that I can whip any room
into shape in 15 minutes or less. (I share the secrets to speed-
cleaning in Chapters 7 through 11.) You, on the other hand, may
find cleaning a kind of therapy, purging closets and sorting through
drawers in place of having a meltdown.
Whether you’re a utilitarian, “get ’er done” type or you have a
more Zen attitude (creating an environment that nurtures your
spirit), the approaches I present in this book are all adaptable for
your unique cleaning personality.

Chapter 2
What’s Green Got 
to Do with It?
In This Chapter
 Connecting the dots between global warming and cleaning green
 Identifying poisons that pollute the environment and our homes
 Recognizing the threats to our water resources
 Divulging the dirty truth about waste
 Indicating overconsumption as a root cause of climate change
M
any conventional cleaning practices add to environmental
damage by using energy, wasting resources, and polluting
the Earth. Does this risk mean that it’s better to skip the cleaning
altogether? (Wouldn’t that be a great excuse to do away with
housework?) By recognizing the relationship between your 
cleaning practices and the environment, you can identify ways to
“green” your housekeeping for a healthier planet and a healthier
home. This chapter reviews the key environmental issues and how
they relate to how you clean.
Following the Carbon Footprints
The sum total of your actions as they affect the environment is
referred to as your carbon footprint. This footprint is usually meas-
ured by the amount of CO2 that a household generates per year. In
the United States, the average annual household footprint is 55,000
pounds. That’s more than twice as high as Germany’s footprint,
and nearly four times that of the average Swedish household.
Here’s the good news: Just like when you diet to lose weight, you
can go on a diet — a low-carbon diet — to reduce your carbon 
footprint. And the way you clean your house, among all the other
activities that are part of your life, has an impact on how much
weight you can take off.

Coming Clean on the 
Green Connection
Hidden in the utility closets and under-sink cabinets in households
across the country is an army of cleaning products — germ-killing
kitchen formulas, mega-strength toilet bowl sanitizers, and 
stain-zapping laundry detergents. These battalions aren’t alone 
in their attack on dirt. They’re reinforced by heavy artillery: 
high-powered devices that scrub, soak, steam, vacuum, and 
exterminate. Who wouldn’t feel safe with these special forces?
Ah, but there’s more than meets the eye to the relationship
between these defenders against dirt and disorder and the 
environment they’re pledged to protect. Among those cleaning
allies are some decidedly unfriendly elements, insurgents 
that may not have the best interests of Planet Earth at heart.
A basic understanding of the state-of-the-planet and the primary
environmental issues brings a clearer picture of connections
between green and clean that may not be apparent on the surface.
And that knowledge helps to formulate a new alliance between 
a better Earth and the universal principles of a clean and 
healthy home.
What the heck does Mr. Gore 
have to do with Mr. Clean?
By now, it’s hard to imagine that news of global warming has failed
to touch a single person on the planet. Reports of retreating ice
caps, rising temperatures, flooding shorelines, and increasing
shortages of resources have reached even the farthest corners.
These alarms are nothing new — experts have been warning about
pollution, overpopulation, and endangered habitat for decades.
But only in the past several years have world communities begun
to rally for proactive response, as the most eminent minds and 
scientific bodies speak out about climate change: from the Earth
Summit in 1992, when the United Nations presented guidelines 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to An Inconvenient Truth,
Al Gore’s documentary about global warming. In 2007, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that:
 Climate change is unequivocal.
 Most of that change, since the mid-20th century, is likely 
the result of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human
activity.
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
16

 Changes due to greenhouse gas increases will continue even if
levels are stabilized — but efforts to reduce emissions may
have an effect on the extent of change in conditions, such as
temperature increase and rising sea levels.
Few argue the reality of climate change, although there is less
agreement on the extent of the threat, the human role in the 
crisis, the timeline to respond, and the steps necessary to divert
catastrophe. Nevertheless, world governments, including the
United States, are initiating legislation to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
And what causes these anthropogenic — human-caused — 
emissions? The science indicates that the burning of fossil fuels —
primarily petroleum and coal — is the primary culprit.
Powering the world with petroleum
Petroleum, of course, keeps our transportation running and
modern industry humming with the fuel that powers not just
planes, trains, and automobiles, but the world’s manufacturing
plants, construction activity, and industrial farming (often referred
to as agribusiness). Of course, it also plays the lead role in its own
extraction, refinement, and movement to its final destination —
how’s that for a double-whammy?
But petroleum, a nonrenewable resource, does more than fire up
our transportation and manufacturing engines: It’s used to create
super-sized warehouses of modern products from panty hose to
garden hoses. Vitamin capsules, medicines, dishware, cosmetics,
permanent-press clothing, paint, building materials — all find 
their origins in petroleum.
There’s oil in my detergent!
Petrochemicals are a key component in most store-bought cleaning
formulas. Yes, Virginia, there is oil in your laundry detergent. And
dish liquid. And floor wax. And soap — not to mention the soap
dish it sits in. In fact, you’re hard-pressed to tackle your house-
work without a petroleum-infused cleaner.
The use of fossil fuel isn’t limited to the ingredients in your 
cleaner. Every time you plug in a vacuum cleaner, turn on the 
rug shampooer, and run the washing machine, you’re using 
electricity, generated in most cases by some form of fossil fuel:
coal, oil, or gas.
Chapter 2: What’s Green Got to Do with It? 17

Formulating a new green clean
Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is a key step toward sustainability.
It’s an effort that requires the cooperation of big government and
big industry. But individuals who want to be part of the solution
are discovering that manageable changes in their own lives, includ-
ing cutting down on the use of gasoline — whether that means
downsizing from an SUV, trading in for a hybrid car, or taking the
bus to work — and making their home more energy efficient can
bring about big-impact changes.
Changing housekeeping habits also helps reduce the carbon
impact at home. Petro-whittling moves such as the following can
help melt off the pounds:
 Trade in for a newer model. When it comes to cleaning
machines, new is better. The difference in energy efficiency
between a 20-year-old washer and a just-off-the-assembly line
model is huge. Look for the Energy Star designation on major
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
18
Ten surprising places to find petroleum
It’s no news to most people that oil makes the world spin. And factories run. And
construction expand. And vehicles from aircraft carriers to agricultural machinery
get from point A to point B.
But petroleum is a key component in so broad a range of products that we’d find
ourselves standing stark naked on an empty, barren field if they all disappeared.
That’s because almost everything we need to provide food, shelter, and clothing
comes from petroleum.
Plastic, of course, is a petroleum offspring, and almost every manufactured 
product — from infant seats to false teeth — contains at least some plastic. Some
of our most ordinary household products can trace their origins to the oil field, 
as well:
Candles
Lip protector
Contact lenses
Rayon and other synthetic-material clothing
Shower curtains
Credit cards and laminated driver’s licenses
Toothpaste
Telephones
Golf balls
Tape, including transparent, electrician, and VCR
It’s not realistic to suggest that the world do away with petroleum-based materials
(although it’s not a bad idea to substitute with nonpetroleum products when possi-
ble). But recognizing our dependence on them fosters an understanding of how
important this nonrenewable resource has become to our existence.

appliances, including washers and refrigerators. (Visit
www.energystar.gov for a full load of information about
ways to reduce energy consumption.) Although not Energy
Star–rated, the newer models of clothes dryers, vacuum
cleaners, and air cleaners rate dramatically better on the
energy-efficiency scale.
 Degrease your cleaning formulas. Virtually all detergents —
even many of the green, vegetable- or plant-based brands —
contain varying levels of petrochemicals. Purists prefer the
homemade formulas Grandma would approve of. (See Chapter
6 for lots of recipes.)
 Unplug it. Instead of behaving — as your dad would say —
like you have stock in the electric company, invest in sweat
equity instead. Let your delicates drip-dry and give the dryer
a rest. Give your wrist a workout and open your tuna with a
manual can opener.
Warning: Disinfecting May Be
Hazardous to the Planet
Pollution from toxic substances is another negative byproduct of
reliance on fossil fuels. Environmental calamities from ozone
damage and smog to contaminated water supplies can find their
roots in the burning of nonrenewables, such as petroleum and
coal. And all can result in the following serious damage to the 
natural world:
 Smog alert. Utility plants, oil refineries, and coal burning 
facilities are among the biggest generators of acid rain, ozone
compromise, particle pollution, and the release of chemicals
that shade the skies an ominous gray and brown. This air 
pollution causes breathing problems, damages trees and 
eats away at metal, building materials, and even ancient 
monuments.
 Dead in the water. Chemical runoff from factories, farms, and
even residential lawns — where petroleum-based pesticides
and fertilizers are used — pours into streams and waterways
with disastrous consequences, destroying water life and 
creating algaes that upset the balance of the underwater
ecosystem.
 Dangerous ground: The same processes and chemicals that
cause air and water pollution contaminate soil and threaten
vegetation and the creatures (including humans) that depend
on them.
Chapter 2: What’s Green Got to Do with It? 19

Outing indoor pollution
Once they’re done with their dirty work, tough-acting cleaning
products contribute their share to environmental havoc when
they’re washed down the drain or dumped into the ground. They
also do a number on indoor air quality.
In our battles against germs, we often wipe out the enemy only 
to discover we have a bigger threat. The conventional cleaning 
formulas employed in housekeeping often contain chemicals that
can activate or aggravate a spectrum of health problems.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chemicals found in certain
household products and prevalent in paints, varnishes, household
furniture, and carpeting, escape into the air as vapor and con-
tribute to what’s been dubbed sick building syndrome. According to
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), VOC levels can be as
much as five times higher indoors than outside. Even at lesser
levels, VOCs are known to aggravate allergies and cause asthma
and respiratory illnesses, and are linked to other health problems.
Children and pets are most vulnerable to these conditions.
Ammonia, butyl cellusolve, phthalates, perchlorethylene, benzene:
An alphabet soup of ingredients in commercial cleaning formulas
has been connected to cancer and other serious conditions. 
(Read more about cleaning and health issues in Chapter 3.)
Breathing easier with 
greener cleaning
Eliminating or reducing the everyday use of toxic chemicals 
and keeping them out of our water systems is a step toward a
healthier home and environment. Reducing the damage from
common household products requires positive changes, such as
the following:
 To be certain that cleaning formulas don’t contain chemicals
that have been linked to health problems or pollution, choose
products that list ingredients on the container. Because
they’re not legally required to do so, few manufacturers 
disclose their contents on the label. The Household Products
Database (http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov) is helpful in searching
by chemical or product.
 Dispose of toxic solutions responsibly by taking advantage 
of hazardous-materials collection sites. Pouring chemicals
down the drain means they end up in the water supply 
(we’re hearing a lot these days about the high level of 
pharmaceuticals in our drinking water) and the soil, as well.
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
20

Getting into Hot Water
Water is a precious resource on Planet Earth. But if alien beings
dropped in on a typical household in the United States, they’d
never guess it. American earthlings wash small loads of laundry 
in large tubs of water; take 20-minute showers; leave the faucet
running while brushing and flossing; fill up backyard swimming
pools; and hose down massive lawns of water-guzzling grass.
Sure, 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered in water — but
only a small percentage is drinkable. And that supply is drying 
up as the world’s population grows and as negative weather 
conditions, such as drought, increase. The average American uses
300 gallons of water each day — for drinking, showering, flushing,
and washing — yet 1.2 billion people around the globe don’t have
access to potable drinking water or have enough water for their
animals and crops, which then reduces their food supply.
Throwing money down the drain
With on-demand access, you can easily take water availability for
granted. Residents in certain parts of the country, however, are
familiar with the consequences of drought and make sacrifices to
reduce water consumption by foregoing watering their lawns and
even being cognizant of too much toilet-flushing.
When it comes to cleaning, water is almost always part of the 
equation, from the content in cleaning formulas to the buckets of
hot water for scrubbing the kitchen floor. Letting the water run —
running the hose as you wash your car, keeping the faucet on as
you rinse dishes, waiting for the shower water to heat up before
you step in — hikes up the water bill as it drains valuable
resources.
The bathroom, in fact, is the home’s primary water villain, with the
toilet demanding more than a quarter of the monthly water bill and
using as much as eight gallons per flush. The washing machine is
the second-biggest guzzler.
Calculating the energy cost of water
Having water available on demand comes with an energy cost.
That water is pumped into your pipes by means of a system 
powered by — you guessed it — fossil-fueled electricity. Nearly 5
percent of electrical energy in the United States goes to moving
and treating water, and in some locations, it accounts for more
than 50 percent of municipal energy consumption.
Chapter 2: What’s Green Got to Do with It? 21

Heating up the debate
If wasting water isn’t bad enough, the temperature at which you’re
wasting it can make things even worse. In fact, you don’t even have
to turn on the hot water to expend electricity. Working around 
the clock, your water heater keeps a 40- or 50-gallon tankful at the
ready. And when you use it up, it generates a new batch — without
being asked. Appliances and fixtures that can get you into further
hot water include
 Washing machines: Washing a full load of clothes in an 
older-model machine can require as much as 40 to 55 gallons
of water. Doing a load in hot water increases energy use by as
much as 90 percent, according to Energy Star.
 Dishwashers: Older machines suck up as much as 25 gallons
per wash, and extra rinse cycles only increase that amount.
The cycle uses the same amount of water and energy whether
it’s a half or full load.
 Showers: Keeping yourself clean takes energy, too. In many
homes, the water heater is located far from the bath plumb-
ing, so the hot water must travel a ways to get to the shower-
head. You know what that means: You wait several minutes for
it to warm up as water just pours down the drain.
Reducing the water pressure
To be clean and green means being conscientious about taxing the
water supply and looking for ways, whenever possible, to clean
with less water. The green-minded housekeeper follows these kinds
of practices:
 Turn off the tap. You can easily treat the faucet like a fountain
while soaping up or rinsing the dishes, washing the car, or
brushing your teeth. But your plumbing fixtures may be the
biggest culprit in water waste.
 Stop the drain on water resources at all source points.
Update your plumbing with low-flow showerheads, faucet 
aerators, and low-flush toilets, and check regularly for leaks.
 Purchase a Star. Replacing your old clothes washer with an
Energy Star model reduces water usage dramatically: in the
case of clothes washers, by as much as 50 percent. Other
water-using fixtures, such as toilets, showerheads, and 
sink aerators, are also much more conservative than their
free-spending ancestors.
 Fill it up. Do full loads of dishes and clothes and choose a
shorter cycle to reduce water and electricity.

22

 Keep it cool. Whenever possible, without sacrificing clean,
use a lower water temperature for washing, mopping, and
soaking. Also keep the water heater at 120°F or less.
Talking Trash
The explosion of waste is another monumental environmental 
concern: In addition to using up limited resources faster than they
can be renewed, consumers are adding insult to injury by throwing
it all away.
Try this experiment: For a single day, don’t throw away anything.
Instead, collect it all in one bin. Every credit-card offer, LL Bean
catalog, yogurt container, paper cup, chicken bone, coffee ground,
and water bottle. If you’re like the average American, according 
to the EPA, you’ll have collected nearly five pounds of trash by 
the end of the day. Sort through your garbage, and you’re likely to
discover that more than one-third is paper, with yard trimmings,
food waste, and plastic making up some 12 percent each.
Recycling to the rescue
Good news: The nation’s recycling habits are improving. According
to the EPA, in 2005, as much as one-third of all waste (excluding
hazardous, industrial, and construction materials) was recycled, a
rate that has nearly doubled over the past 15 years. About 33 per-
cent of all plastic and more than half of all used paper are recycled.
Bad news: We’re also generating more trash than ever. Take the
bottled water phenomenon: From 1999 to 2004, consumption
increased by 57 percent to 6.9 billion gallons per year. If only 
one-third of those bottles are recycled, that means a lot more 
plastic in the landfill, no matter how you calculate it.
All this waste comes with a high energy cost for such a short-lived
existence — the typical plastic shopping bag you carry home is
used for an average of 25 minutes before it’s tossed.
Taking the wraps off
An unhealthy chunk of that solid waste comes from the packaging
wrapped around the stuff you buy: the double-wrapped deli sand-
wich you pick up for lunch, the single-serving juices and yogurts
(they’re now packaging individual prunes in their own little bags!),
and the CD you still haven’t played because you can’t pry the 
tape-wrap off.
Chapter 2: What’s Green Got to Do with It? 23

Cleaning products come in packaging, too, of course: boxes of 
powdered dish soap, jars of furniture polish, cans of sink scrub,
squirt bottles of window cleaner, and rolls of plastic trash bags.
It takes energy and materials to make all that packaging, whether
the big plastic jug of laundry detergent or the layers of cellophane
shrink-wrapped around a three-pack of sponges — start ringing 
up those CO2 emissions. But before you’re done adding them, 
consider what most of this packaging is made of. You guessed it —
more fossil fuels. Your petroleum-laced cleaner is served up in a
petroleum-based bottle.
And check out the tools of the trade: the mops, the dust pans, the
brooms, the roll of paper towels you go through — either made of
plastic or wrapped in plastic. And when those items have lived
their lives? More fodder for the landfill.
Stripping down to the bare essentials
Ironic, isn’t it, that the process of cleaning can result in so much
trash? But when approaching chores with an awareness of waste
potential, the enlightened environmentalist can adapt behaviors to
lessen the impact:
 Buy smarter. Look for ways to reduce the amount of packag-
ing in your purchases. When you buy larger amounts of 
detergent, over the long run, you reduce the packaging. Many
products are available as refills, sold in bags or pouches with
a smaller amount of material.
 Steer clear of tossaways. An abundance of single-use 
cleaning products promises convenience, but also produces 
a lot of extra trash. Eschewing one-swipe counter wipes for
reusable cloths or, better yet, recycled bath towels is a more
sustainable way of dealing with dirt.
 Read the ingredients of the container. When it comes to
reducing waste, it pays to judge the outside of a product as
well as the inside. If your detergent comes in a recycled-
content container and can be recycled when you’re through
with it, you reduce the drain on resources.
Suffering from Affluenza
Could there be a direct correlation between global warming and
the current economic condition in which borrowers, homeowners,
and even banks and countries have overextended themselves?
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
24

Plenty of environmental watchdogs say, “Yes!” Overconsumption,
they insist, is the root cause of climate change and at-risk
resources.
Why? Because all that stuff requires energy and resources to 
manufacture it, ship it, store it, use it, and throw it away. Behind
every new kitchen blender, electric toothbrush, coffee table,
designer dress, set of golf clubs, sports car, laptop, power mower,
and plasma TV stand a cadre of increasingly endangered
resources.
We’re gonna need a bigger closet
In just a generation or two, the United States has become a nation
of walk-in closets, spa-sized bathrooms, four-car garages, and a TV
in every room. According to the National Association of Home
Builders, the average home size has more than doubled since 1950
to nearly 2,400 square feet. Despite this extra room, more families
are renting storage units just to keep all the possessions that
simply don’t fit in their existing home.
It’s a condition that documentary producer John de Graaf identi-
fied as affluenza in his film of the same name, and it’s undeniably
reached epidemic — perhaps even pandemic — levels as 
developing nations scramble to keep pace with the acquisition
levels of their Western counterparts.
Small steps for big changes
The unequal distribution of limited resources aside, this drive to
acquire doesn’t bode well for the environment. In a nutshell, if the
world were to continue to support itself at the current levels of
consumption, we’d need 1.25 planets. And if the whole world 
consumed at the level of the United States, well, that would require
six planets. At this rate, we’re likely to run out of planet before we
run out of demand.
The impact of this out-of-control consumption on our house-
keeping practices is pretty obvious. Hmmm . . . an additional 
1,400 square feet of space? That means a lot more time and energy
spent cleaning — any way you do the math.
But positive changes are afoot. Defying an overall trend for larger
homes, a movement among forward-thinking designers and 
architects has resulted in a flurry of books and articles about the
joys of a smaller home with higher-end finishes. As awareness
Chapter 2: What’s Green Got to Do with It? 25

grows and builders and consumers alike embrace the values 
of sustainability in greater numbers, we’re certain to see our 
cumulative carbon footprint leave a lighter mark. (For more 
on the carbon footprint, see the section “Following the Carbon
Footprints,” earlier in this chapter.)

f I asked most people what it would take to persuade them to
make a change in their lives, I’m betting I’d get at least some
iteration of these responses: “It’s healthy.” “It saves money.” “It’s
really easy.”
Change is a good thing, of course. It inspires a lot of positive
energy, a heady excitement, and a new way of looking at the world.
But there’s a yang to that yin: Change is also difficult, stressful,
even frightening. Precisely because of these reasons, people often
avoid change altogether. Unless there’s the promise of some per-
sonal payback — or at least a probability that the change will be
effortless and painfree.
I have great news: The path toward a more sustainable lifestyle
offers all these what’s-in-it-for-me benefits — and then some. In this
chapter, I explore how converting to more Earth-friendly cleaning
practices can make your home a healthier place, save you money,
and become an effortless part of your green-clean lifestyle. And, it
can be fun.
Is Your Home Making You Sick?
The cleaning-product industry seems to view housekeeping 
as germ warfare: With liberal use of descriptives such as 
“kills on contact,” “decimates,” “destroys,” and “wipes out,” the

manufacturers of commercial cleaning solutions approach their
work as a room-to-room battle against bacterial insurgency and 
house-borne illnesses.
Most of this “defenders-of-the-clean-world” positioning is simply
part of the advertising hype. But the fact is, your home — and
buildings in general — can pose a threat to your well-being, and
that threat isn’t just from the germs and dirt that conventional
cleaners vow to protect you against. Within the four walls that
make up your sanctuary from the world lurk an army of hazards,
hidden in dark corners, under floors and carpets, inside showers,
and behind the walls. Your home can make you sick. Literally.
In addition to choosing the right building materials and furnish-
ings, keeping your home dry, well-ventilated, and clean helps 
protect against many household health risks. But how effective 
are green cleaning practices? Promoting themselves as “Earth-
gentle,” “ecofriendly,” and “safe for plants and animals,” they do
seem to lean more toward the speak-softly strategists than the
carry-a-big-stick camp.
By understanding the potential health threats in your home, 
you can easily see that among the strategies for combating sick-
building syndrome, having good green housekeeping practices 
is a No. 1 ally.
Factors in poor indoor air quality
A confluence of forces within your home can create an unhealthy
environment. From that old carpet where the dog’s slept for the
past ten years to the vinyl floor in the kitchen that still gives off the
new smell, your home exudes its own atmosphere in more ways
than one — and I’m not talking about bad feng shui. The combina-
tion of all sorts of elements can bombard you on a daily basis with
substances unseen but highly potent.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air 
pollution is one of the top five environmental risks to public
health. Levels of pollutants inside a private home are often five
times higher than levels outside — and under certain circum-
stances, they can be as high as 1,000 times higher. This pollution
can result in a slew of respiratory problems, including asthma.
Poor indoor air quality can cause headaches, dry eyes, nasal 
congestion, nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms. Children and
people with respiratory illnesses are at an even greater risk.
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
28

Don’t count on being able to see signs of poor air quality. Although
you may be able to pick up on the strong acrid smell of a new furni-
ture stain or “feel” that a room is too humid, indoor air pollution 
is particularly insidious in that it is often invisible. Primary culprits
of poor indoor air quality include
 Poor ventilation: When the air inside the home doesn’t 
have enough circulation, unhealthy particle matter — dust
and pollen, for example — and gases from chemicals in 
furnishings and household products stay in the atmosphere,
creating their own form of smog.
 Humidity: Bathrooms, basements, kitchens, and other areas
where moisture can collect in dark, warm spots are prone to
structural rot and the growth of mildew and mold, which may
not be visible when the damage is spreading behind the tiles
of a bathroom shower or under the floorboards where a pipe
is leaking.
 Biological pollutants: In addition to mildew and molds, 
bacteria, dust, dust mite droppings, pollen, and pet hair and
dander are other biological contaminants that wreak havoc.
 Radon: A gas created when uranium in the Earth decays,
radon can enter your home through cracks and other entry
points in the foundation. It’s the second-leading cause of 
lung cancer. The good news is you can test for radon — and
prevent it from getting into your home. For more information,
visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s site at
www.epa.gov.
 Chemicals in some building materials and furnishings:
Treated wood used in home construction, carpets, flooring,
and furniture can emit chemicals known as volatile organic
compounds — harmful substances, such as formaldehyde, that
are released as gases and remain in the air until after the new
smell has worn away. Older homes may contain asbestos 
insulation, which can release fibers dangerous to lung health
when in poor or deteriorating condition.
 Household products: Personal-care toiletries, pesticides,
paints, solvents, and cleaning solutions may be sources of
hundreds of potentially harmful VOCs and chemicals that
compromise the air quality of your home.
The next two sections tell you what you need to know about these
common pollutants.
Chapter 3: Adding Up the Pluses of Cleaning Green 29

Dander and dust mites 
and mold — oh my!
Some of the worst-offending home pollutants come from biological
sources: your beloved family dog and cat (pet hair and dander);
pollen; tiny little dust mites that like to snuggle into your pillows
and bed linens; and mold spores that reproduce like rabbits in the
privacy of your home’s dark, damp hiding places.
Most of these contaminants are so small, they can’t be seen; 
typically they’re measured in microns — as in microscopic. But
what they lack in size, they make up in impact, making their 
presence known by penetrating into your airways and lungs and
potentially producing a string of symptoms: some as mild as
headaches, dizziness, flu or cold symptoms, and fatigue. For those
sensitive to respiratory conditions, they can trigger allergic reac-
tions and asthma attacks. The worst pollutants — such as toxic
black mold — have been linked to serious immune deficiencies,
attacks on the central nervous system, and, in rare cases, death.
Keys to eliminating these sources of indoor air pollution are good
cleaning practices:
 Cleaning bathrooms weekly helps wipe out mildew and mold
before it can do damage.
 Vacuuming floors and carpets with a HEPA (high-efficiency
particulate air) filter picks up irritants. Both bag and bagless
models can be effective — but do be careful with bagless 
vacuums so that you don’t accidentally release dust and 
particles when you open the machine.
 Washing bedding and curtains frequently helps reduce pet
hair, dust, dust mites, and other contaminants.
 Keeping food-preparation surfaces scrupulously clean cuts
down on food-borne bacterial illnesses.
Good ventilation helps fend off the negative effects of pet dander,
bacteria, dust mites, and the formation of mildew and mold. And,
of course, controlling the humidity in wet-prone areas, such as
bathrooms, basements, and kitchens, helps, too.
Chasing down chemical 
contaminants
You’ve probably walked into someone else’s home and, by your
first inhale, knew that something in the place was new: the 
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
30

carpeting, the kitchen cabinetry and countertop, a sofa, or even
new paint. Although sharp, acrid, and sometimes overwhelming,
the odor frequently elicits positive feelings — the new smell is
often equated with cleanliness, abundance, and being able to
afford nice possessions.
To many people, however, that first breath equates to dizziness,
nausea, coughing, and difficulty in breathing. Others may not 
react as strongly, but the chemicals emitting those smells affect all
people who are exposed to them at any length.
VOCs are in the air
That new smell comes from VOCs, which come from many of the
following materials:
Carpeting
Vinyl flooring
Pressed wood
Furniture
Upholstery
Paint
Varnish
Treated wood
Fiberglass insulation
Solvents
Adhesives
Nail polish remover
Air fresheners
Gasoline
Mothballs
Cosmetics
Insect killer
Cleaning products
VOCs include a variety of chemicals, such as formaldehyde, 
benzene, and tuolene, found in adhesives in carpeting. The new
smell lingers in the air for quite some time as the gases continue 
to slowly release. This process is called outgassing or offgassing,
and it’s another good reason to keep the home well-ventilated!
Eventually, all the VOCs dissipate — this process can take 
anywhere from three months to five years or more. But in the
meantime, they’re known to cause both short- and long-term
adverse affects, ranging from eye, nose, and throat irritation;
headaches; and nausea. They also damage the liver, kidneys, and
central nervous system. Some VOCs are suspected or known to
cause cancer in humans.
Pointing the finger at the top suspects
Indoor air quality can get worse when you have a mix of chemicals
within the confines of your house — the combination of those
chemicals can create other toxic compounds. Some of the known
offenders are
Chapter 3: Adding Up the Pluses of Cleaning Green 31

 Ammonia: A common cleaning agent in toilet bowl cleaners
and all-purpose sprays, ammonia is regulated by protective
agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Food and Drug Administration, and the Occupational Safety &
Health Administration.
 Chlorine bleach: Found in laundry bleach, dishwasher deter-
gent, scouring powders, and tub and tile cleaners, chlorine
bleach is a byproduct of chlorine, listed in the 1990 Clean Air
Act as a hazardous air pollutant. It’s on the EPA’s Community
Right-to-Know list, as well. In 1993, the American Public 
Health Association issued a resolution calling for the gradual
phase-out of most chlorine-based compounds.
 Synthetic solvents: These chemicals appear in all-purpose
cleaners, window sprays, floor strippers, degreasers, and
oven, metal, and carpet cleaners under an alphabet soup of
names, including ethyl cellosolve, ethylene glycol, ethylene
dichloride, butyl cellosolve, and 2-butoxyethanol. Ethylene
glycol, for example, is found in everything from window 
cleaners to antifreeze and is listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act 
as a hazardous air pollutant and is on the EPA’s Community
Right-to-Know list.
 Formaldehyde: Conventional deodorizers, disinfectants, 
and germicides can contain this compound that is common 
in household products such as adhesives, permanent-press
fabrics, particle board, and many others. The EPA has 
classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen.
 Optical brighteners: These synthetic chemicals in laundry
detergents make clothes appear whiter, but don’t actually
make them cleaner. They’re toxic to fish when washed into
the general environment and can create bacterial mutations.
Optical brighteners also can cause allergic reaction when in
contact with skin that is then exposed to sunlight.
 Phosphates: Although phased out of laundry detergents and
other cleaners, phosphates are still added to some automatic
dish detergents to soften water. When released into the house-
hold wastewater, phosphates encourage certain algae to grow,
which then upsets the ecosystem balance, killing many forms
of water life.
 Perchloroethylene: Perc is the chemical used in the dry-
cleaning process, but it’s also found in spot cleaners and
degreasers. Classified as a hazardous air pollutant by the 
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
32

EPA and a probable human carcinogen by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer, it’s also a primary 
groundwater contaminant.
Other chemicals, including phthalates and alkylphenol ethoxylates
(APEs), have raised controversy as some studies have linked them
to cancer and diseases of the reproductive system. Phthalates, a
common component of plastic and a petroleum derivative, are
commonly contained in fragrance additives, and APEs are often
found in detergents, fabric softeners, and products that foam.
You won’t find these on the ingredients list
Don’t bother pulling out your reading glasses: Even if you know
which ingredients to avoid, don’t expect to find them listed on
most cleaning products. Manufacturers aren’t required by law to
disclose the ingredients in cleaning formulas on the label. Some
cleaners may advertise that they are environmentally sound but
fail to provide a full list of ingredients.
In choosing products for your health and environmental safety,
make sure that you can find a full list of ingredients — that’s a
good sign — even if you haven’t a clue what those polysyllabic
mouthfuls of letters means. You can find out more about the 
formulas by visiting the Household Products Database Web site
(http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov) and looking up the Material Safety
Data Sheet (MSDS).
Also, be on the lookout for certain claims that may not carry a lot
of weight:
 All-natural or nontoxic: These terms are unregulated and
can’t necessarily be validated.
 Biodegradable: Referring to a chemical’s ability to break
down into harmless components, this claim is only 
meaningful if the product indicates how long it will remain 
in the environment.
 Plant-based: While agents derived from plant sources are
better, be aware that some manufacturers may advertise 
their plant-derived ingredients — while downplaying their
synthetic components.
 Phosphate-free: Because phosphates have been phased out of
virtually all laundry detergents, this claim is meaningless. Be
aware, however, that many automatic dish detergents still
contain phosphates.
Chapter 3: Adding Up the Pluses of Cleaning Green 33

Home Safe Home: Green 
Solutions to the Rescue
Environmental practices, from choosing natural building materials
or those without harmful chemicals to building and maintaining 
an energy-efficient structure that allows for fresh air exchange,
support a healthy home. (For a further exploration into the tenets
of green building, read Green Building & Remodeling For Dummies
by Eric Corey Freed [Wiley].)
But green cleaning techniques, despite their kinder-to-the-planet
characteristics, can be just as tough in room-to-room combat 
with indoor pollution and offer one of the best ways to get toxins
out of your space. Here are a few cleaning practices that have 
a positive effect in reducing poor indoor air quality and other 
environmental risks:
 Eliminate the usual chemical suspects. Avoid cleaning prod-
ucts that contain the most offensive compounds, including
the chemicals listed in the section named “Pointing the finger
at the top suspects.”
 Choose safer cleaning agents. Because most manufacturers
don’t list all the ingredients in the product, this one can be a
challenge. Stick with cleaners that disclose all the ingredients
or make your own simple and safe formulas (see Chapter 6).
 Get the dirt to stick. Conventional dusting and sweeping can
actually make air quality worse by stirring up sleeping dust
and dirt into the air. The best solution is to replace your old
shaggy-headed dust mop for one with a microfiber pad — dirt
sticks to it like Velcro.
 Suck it up. Vacuuming regularly helps keep pollutants at 
bay — as long as the vacuum is actually sucking up dirt
instead of spewing it out. A HEPA filter is a critical component
of a good vacuum. Look for one that traps 99.97 percent 
of particulates .3 microns and larger, which include some
chemical contaminants that bind to household dust.
 Clear the air. Use an energy-efficient air purifier to remove
dust, pollen, and tobacco particulates from your home.
Conventional air cleaners can drain a lot of energy, but to
keep energy use under control, choose an Energy Star–rated
model. (You can find listings on www.energystar.gov.) 
Select the smallest model that meets your needs based on
area size.
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean

Counting up the Cost 
of Cleaning Green
I’ll be honest: In some respects, going green demands a lot more
green — you know, the kind with dollar signs? A neighbor just got 
a quote on installing solar panels to generate his home’s energy.
The estimate was almost as much as my first home! Tankless water
heaters, hybrid cars, even free-range eggs and grass-fed beef cost
more than their conventional counterparts. Organic towels and
sheets? Before you look at the thread count, better count up the
extra expense.
Of course, cost is relative. The organic, locally grown tomatoes 
are a good $1 a pound more than the hothouse brand. But when
you weigh in the fertilizers and pesticides used to grow the 
conventional tomatoes and add the embodied energy from their
packaging, storage, and cross-country journey to your grocery
store, the environmental price tag offsets any cost savings.
While it’s true that some green upgrades may require more cash
out of your pocket, cleaning green is not one of them. In fact, in
most cases, following environmental cleaning practices can save
you money.
Shopping for green cleaners
As you stroll down the housecleaning aisle at the grocery or big
box chain, you’re bound to notice that, in most cases, the Earth-
friendly cleaning brands are more expensive than the conventional
names your mother would be familiar with. A recent shopping
expedition in a Midwestern discount chain confirmed that for toilet
bowl sanitizer, all-purpose spray, laundry detergent, window
cleaner, and dish soap, the green brands were pricier — sometimes
by spare change and sometimes by several dollars more.
Bottom line: If you intend to stock your utility closet with 
preformulated cleaning supplies from green-brand lines, be 
prepared to budget just a bit higher.
But if you’re willing to take the minute or two to whip up your own
recipes from basic household workhorses — baking soda, white
distilled vinegar, and salt— you can watch your cleaning budget
plunge deeper than a plumber’s snake. (See Chapter 6 for dozens
of easy, inexpensive — and effective — recipes for household
cleaning solutions.)
Chapter 3: Adding Up the Pluses of Cleaning Green 35

As of late, more commercial brands are advertising cleaning 
solutions with baking soda, vinegar, and other environmentally
safe ingredients. In some cases, these products also contain the
offending chemicals that make them environmentally undesirable.
But they also cost as much as the other commercial products. 
So, why buy a window cleaner with vinegar when the vinegar alone
works at least as well — at one-tenth the price?
Considering your time investment
In addition to the cost of your cleaning solutions, your time has a
value, too. If it didn’t, why would housecleaning franchises be 
popping up like dandelions? Plenty of homeowners are willing to
pay as much as $100 an hour for a cleaning crew rather than 
sacrifice hours of their own time.
But if you’re cleaning on your own dime, you don’t have to worry
about adding anything more than negligible increments to your
time. Count on a few minutes to mix together your own cleaning
solutions — if you’re bypassing the store-bought products — 
and a little more time if you opt for old-fashioned, appliance-free
cleaning methods, such as dust-mopping instead of vacuuming 
or hanging your wash to dry in the sun rather than loading up 
the dryer.
You may have to invest a little more sweat equity into your 
scrubbing and scouring efforts. Giving your oven a good cleaning
may feel like the equivalent of 20 minutes of upper-body exercise.
Multiplying energy costs — 
and savings
Replacing old energy-sapping or water-gulping appliances with
new, efficient models may, at first pass, seem like an enormous
cost to achieving a higher level of green cleaning. A brand-new,
front-loading clothes washer can cost $1,000 or more.
But the long-term view is that upgrading to the more energy-
efficient appliance saves on energy and water to run it. The govern-
ment’s Energy Star program likes to point out that an appliance 
has two price tags: the price you pay to take it home and the price
you pay to operate it. And when you consider the combined cost,
the Energy Star models almost always save money. Cost savings of
an Energy Star–rated clothes washer, for example, can be as much
as $550 over 11 years — not a bad rebate!
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
36

Dishwashers, refrigerators, air conditioners, air purifiers, 
dehumidifiers, and other appliances meeting the strict Energy 
Star qualification are identified by the blue and white Energy Star
logo and a yellow and black label attached to the appliance. The
label indicates the average energy used per year and how that
compares to the models that use the most and the least.
Not all energy savings benefits require the patience to wait for the
long-term payoff — you can achieve some immediate benefits by
switching to these cost-cutting practices:
 Switch to cold water when washing most loads of laundry 
to reduce the energy cost of heating the water. (Do wash 
bed linens in warmer water, especially if anyone in your home
has an allergy to dust mites.) Another plus to cold-water
washing — your clothes last longer.
 Let your clothes line-dry. Give your dryer the day off and
resort to solar power for help. The sun serves as a 
germ-killer — and that sweet outdoor-fresh smell is thrown 
in for free. In winter, drying racks work great inside.
 Raid your pantry. Instead of restocking your cleaning solu-
tions as they run out, give old kitchen standbys a try: baking
soda, lemon juice, salt, and vinegar. Fill up a spray bottle 
with equal amounts of vinegar and water and use it as an 
all-purpose cleaner for kitchen and bathroom surfaces, as well
as for appliances, windows, toilets, and more. Reuse your
newspapers as cleaning rags and revel in the streak-free shine
of your windows. (For more homemade cleaning recipes, 
turn to Chapter 6.)
Changing Your Ways, 
One Step at a Time
It’s hard to overcome years’ worth of ingrained habits. Believe it 
or not, brushing teeth is one of the biggest challenges that trips up
folks vowing to reduce their environmental impact! A friend had
such problems resisting the reflex to run the water while she
brushed that she taped a plastic flower to the top of the tap to
remind herself. And still, she confesses that she continues to reach
for it every morning and evening.
Changing these deeply grounded routines is a challenge, but it’s
one that can be conquered successfully. A journey of a thousand
miles, so says Lao Tzu, begins with a single step. Fortunately, the
Chapter 3: Adding Up the Pluses of Cleaning Green 37

journey toward cleaning green is not quite so long. And you’ve
already taken the first steps: awakening to the benefits of change,
and committing yourself to the process.
The next step is to break down the journey into measurable,
doable segments.
Starting simple
Don’t demand difficult changes right out of the gate. Begin by
adopting easy routines — just one or two at a time so that you’re
not overwhelmed. You might, for example, concentrate on water
usage in the laundry room, remembering to always wash full loads
and switching to cold-water washes and rinses. Then, when you
get that down to a reflex routine, work on your water-use habits in
the kitchen.
Don’t put off taking action by insisting that you can’t really get
started until you go out and buy all new cleaning supplies or
replace your washer and dryer and other appliances. Start at the
beginning, with changes as simple as these:
 Eliminate disposable products — paper towels and single-use
cleaning wipes, for example — and substitute with reusable
cleaning cloths or, better yet, “recycled” bath towels 
and socks.
 As you run out of the cleaning products in your utility closet,
begin replacing them with ecofriendly brands or homemade
solutions.
 Make one-time changes that you don’t have to think about
again: Turn down the temperature on your water heater, 
and you reduce energy costs throughout the house.
Making a change with impact
One way to ratchet up your efforts is to choose a single change
that has a big wallop. Lowering the temperature of your wash 
from warm or hot to cold is one such change. Here are some 
other ideas:
 If replacing a major appliance, choose an Energy Star or
energy-efficient model. A new, front-load clothes washer
reduces your energy use and water use — and your 
utility bills.
Part I: A Greener, Healthier Way to Clean 
38

 Have your furnace and air conditioner serviced. Regularly
changing filters keeps these systems fine-tuned, and clean 
filters go a long way in reducing energy bills in hot and 
cold seasons.
Doing what you can
Sometimes, perfection is used to camouflage procrastination. 
How many people have vowed to start working out “just as soon 
as I join the gym” or to stop smoking “once this stress period at
work is over.”
Don’t wait until you’ve replaced all your appliances with energy-
efficient models or until your community offers curbside recycling.
You don’t have to do it perfectly to make a difference. “If a thing is
worth doing,” said English essayist G. K. Chesterton, “it is worth
doing badly.”
Believing that your efforts have little positive impact on the 
planet is another stumbling block. Climb over this one, too.
Changing your thermostat just 2°F can have a measurable effect 
on your home’s energy use. As you discover throughout this 
book, the smallest changes add up to a big return.
Don’t waste energy beating yourself up for not doing it all.
Acknowledge your reasons for not embracing all the changes 
suggested in this book — whether because of personal discomfort
or external pressures. Maybe your neighborhood has a rule 
against hanging laundry out to dry, or someone in your household
is unwilling to participate in your recycling efforts.
That’s okay. Do what you can — you’re still contributing more 
than you can imagine to the movement toward sustainable living
practices. The mere fact that you’re aware of the impact of your
actions has a profound impact of its own.

 Following the “stitch-in-time” mentality
 Integrating recycling into your home
 Creating a workable cleaning plan
“R
educe, reuse, and recycle” doesn’t only refer to how you
handle your possessions; it also applies to how you use
your time. Why squander your discretionary hours — a precious
resource in its own right — when you can find efficient ways to get
more done and free up time for enjoying life?
Cleaning greener doesn’t have to mean cleaning more. Look for
ways to preempt housekeeping chores by lightening up on clutter
and getting organized. When you employ tactics to prevent the
need to clean, you reduce the time you devote to cleaning your
home, use less time to accomplish more, and convert former
housework time into something much more fun.
Less Is More: Clearing 
Out the Clutter
Whether you know it as voluntary simplicity, downshifting, or
simple living, a movement that rejects consumerism is afoot.
Although not a new philosophy, the principles dovetail easily with
the environmental movement, as another avenue to reduce the
strain on natural resources.
But simple living isn’t about sacrifice or deprivation, but rather
unburdening yourself of possessions and obligations so that you
have the freedom and resources to focus on what really matters 
to you. Think of it as traveling light in your day-to-day life.

When it comes to cleaning, the simpler the better. A kitchen with
the bare minimum of counter clutter is much easier to shine up
than one filled up with an assortment of appliances, cookbooks,
dish racks, and other accoutrements. Same goes for coffee tables,
floors, closets, and shelves. Less is definitely more.
I’m not suggesting wholesale purging of possessions or getting rid
of items you love, use, or value. (You can employ tactics such as
placing keepsakes in glass-front cabinets so that you can enjoy
them without having to dust them as often.) But everyone has
those pockets and corners in the home that have become landfills
of unused stuff. Taming your inner packrat and clearing out the
clutter allows you to enjoy the pleasure of newly liberated space
and definitely reduces your cleaning efforts.
When you’re done, you may have cleared out a garage’s worth of
discards, but they don’t have to end up in a landfill. Find new uses
for your old possessions with a range of options:
 Sell clothing that is still fashionable or classic in cut to a 
consignment or second-hand store (or a vintage shop if
you’ve hung on to styles that are decades old).
 Donate clothes, shoes, and accessories to a charity.
 Reuse clothing and linens that are beyond redemption as
cleaning rags.
 If material is still usable, recycle it for projects such as 
pillows, placemats, or doll clothes.
 Gear up for a garage sale and find new homes for your rarely
used appliances, baby furniture and kids’ toys, lawn equip-
ment, file cabinets, treadmill, and collection of magazines that
dates to 1986.
 Set aside those never-been-used presents for regifting . . . as
long as you remember where they originally came from so
that you don’t regift the giver.
 Sell it on eBay at www.eBay.com or Craig’s List at www.craigs
list.org or give it away on Freecycle at www.freecycle.
org — three examples of the many online classified or sales
services that move vintage to virtually unusable items.
 When it comes to medicine or cosmetics, you really don’t
have a re-use option. But don’t flush or wash drugs or makeup
down the drain. Mounting evidence suggests that pharmaceu-
ticals end up in the water system. Toiletries may also 
contain questionable chemicals. Keep items in their original
containers and deliver them to a tox-drop for safe disposal.
Part II: Getting to Work 
44

 Reuse, where possible — could a stained and slightly warped
plastic water pitcher be of any use in the garden?
 Recycle it (see the section on “Creating a Functional Recycling
Area,” later in this chapter).
Reducing the Need to Clean
The best shortcut to maintaining a clean and orderly home is to
sidestep the need to clean. Making changes that reduce the
amount of dirt you bring into the home or the mess you make
means cleaning less often and not having to work as hard.
Leaving your shoes at the door
In many parts of the world, particularly Asia, it’s customary to 
take off shoes that are worn in the outside world and leave 
them at the door, slipping on “house shoes” or shuffling about in
stocking feet. Maintaining a shoe-free home is more than a quaint
custom, however; it’s a wonderful way to keep the crud you pick
up on the bottom of your shoes from ending up on your floors. 
It also reduces scuffmarks, scratches, and wear and tear on floor
materials, from carpet to hardwood.
Keep a mat of assorted slippers at the door for guests to put on.
This hospitable gesture serves as a signal to folks that they can
“get comfortable” and make themselves at home.
Doormats serve a similar purpose. Place a rough-textured mat on
the outside of all entrances to the home, including the garage. If
caked-on mud is an issue, add a boot scraper, a heavy wrought-iron
or stiff-brushed device to run the bottoms of your shoes over. Keep
another doormat on the inside. Well-used doormats mean extra
cleaning, but shaking out or washing a doormat is a lot easier than
mopping and sweeping the floors throughout your house.
If you only have one mat, put it by the door you use the most. So
many people put them at their front door for appearance, but 
for function, you may need it most at the garage, kitchen, or back
door. Also, if the mat will be rained on, get one specially made 
for outside.
Wear it again, Sam
The “wear-it-once” school of thought is anathema to environmental
advocates. A pair of denims or a sweater doesn’t have to go in the
wash after one wearing — unless you’ve been up to your knees in
Chapter 4: An Ounce of Prevention 45

garden muck or running a marathon. Retraining kids or teenagers
to hang up their clothes instead of letting them drop where 
they take them off can help extend the wear before they have to 
be washed.
You can modify other home habits to reduce the frequency of your
washing.
 If just-worn clothes have no discernable stains or dirt, refresh
them by hanging them outside in the sun or in a room with
well-circulated air.
 If you’ve switched to cloth napkins to cut down on paper use
(a great idea even though you must use water and energy to
clean them), consider the European tradition of reusing mildly
soiled napkins for more than one meal. In most homes, family
members tend to sit in the same seat, so what’s the harm if
you reuse the same napkin you used with your bagel and juice
at breakfast for your soup and sandwich at lunch?
 Putting a glass top on a piece of furniture, such as a wood 
cabinet holding a television or a table, is a decorator trick.
This trick prevents staining from glasses or plants and 
makes for easier clean up. Glass can be custom cut to fit the
particular piece of furniture, and the sides are rounded for
appearance and to prevent injuries.
 A clean towel for every shower or bath isn’t necessary: 
Even hotels are catching on and offering guests the option of
turning down daily linen changes. Do the same at home. Do,
however, change towels at least once a week to avoid bacteria
growth that thrives in warm, humid spots. And if allergies are
a problem, be sure to change bed linens frequently to get rid
of dust mites. (For more on eliminating dust mites, see
Chapter 10.)
Preventive maintenance
Scheduling a yearly checkup keeps your furnace and air condi-
tioner healthy. Not only does this preventive measure ensure that
everything is in working order, a smoothly operating appliance
means more efficient energy use, lower utility bills, and cleaner air.
Keeping the air clean
One of the components of the tuneup is changing the air filter,
which you can do yourself more frequently. Change your 
air-conditioner filters monthly during the summer or warm-
weather periods and replace your furnace filter in heating season
every two or three months, more frequently if you have pets.
Part II: Getting to Work 
46

Choose a high-efficiency filter over a traditional fiberglass one.
According to the American Lung Association, a high-efficiency 
filter can capture 30 times the amount of indoor air pollutants,
including smoke, pet hair and dander, and pollen.
Keeping the air dry
Damp air breeds mildew, particularly in the ever-humid bathroom.
A working exhaust fan goes a long way in expelling moisture 
and discouraging the growth of mold and mildew. But mold can
spread to anywhere — wood furniture, books, the clothing in your
closet — so ensure good air circulation throughout the house.
Ventilate by opening the windows and letting the fresh air do 
what it does best. You can’t always open windows, of course, if it’s
extremely cold or hot, or if you live in an area with frequent smog
alert days. When your house is sealed (good for reducing energy
consumption), good circulation is more important than ever.
Despite the increased energy usage, running the fan or the air 
conditioner or furnace may be an unavoidable tactic.
Filters, filters everywhere
The furnace and air conditioner aren’t the only appliances putting
in overtime to filter out dust, pollen, dander, or other elements
dirty and undesirable. Plenty of other filtering devices are at work,
too. Regularly clean out or replace filters and dirt traps for
 Vacuum cleaners
 Air-filtering machines
 Water filters (whole-house water filters or refrigerator 
water-in-the-door filters or faucet filters)
 Dryer lint traps
 Hood exhaust fans above the cooktop or stove (these filters
can go in the dishwasher)
Decorating for fuss-free cleaning
Some home furnishings and materials are just high maintenance:
thick wall-to-wall carpeting, fussy window treatments with swaths
of dust-catching material, wood countertops, peeling wallpaper 
in the bathroom, and anything white. While you gladly bend over
backward for your favorite prima donnas of decor, whenever 
possible, you appreciate those modest materials that demand little
cleaning effort.
Chapter 4: An Ounce of Prevention 47

Many of the new sustainable home materials aren’t only fashion-
able — as one LEED-certified interior designer observed, “Green
looks cool now” — but extremely low maintenance, too. Consider
these alternatives for a combination of style and streamlined 
cleaning:
 Flooring: Limit floor coverings to throw rugs that you can
easily wash or shake out. Choose coverings such as linoleum,
bamboo, concrete, or recycled rubber. (See Chapter 7 for
more details about sustainably manufactured floor materials.)
 Windows: Heavy drapes help to insulate, but layers of
window treatments serve as hosts for dust mites, dander, and
collected filth. If your windows have a high R value, indicating
significant insulative properties, you may want to stick with
simple shade treatments that fit snuggly inside the window
frame or just outside it. Some shades, such as those described
as “honeycomb” or “cellular,” incorporate layers of material
with trapped air pockets that increase insulation. Be careful 
to select natural, nonpetroleum-based materials that don’t
contain coatings or sealants that off-gas.
 Walls: Old-fashioned wallpaper required adhesive that may
emit harmful volatile organic compounds. (Read more about
VOCs in Chapter 3.) Opt for nonvinyl wallpaper or zero-VOC
paints; the latter now comes in eggshell formulas for easier
cleaning than the earlier generations of ecofriendly paints.
 Furniture: Ornately carved wood, elaborately upholstered
pieces, and furnishings of fragile or easily damaged materials
demand more attention and heighten your wear-and-tear 
anxiety factor. Opt for sleek styling and simple shapes.
 Decor: Whether wall hangings, table knick-knacks, bookshelf
items, or display-case show pieces, the more you have, 
the more you have to clean. Ban the busy look and cut your
cleaning time.
Tidy up as you go
You may remember yelling at your kids, “Why can’t you just put it
away when you’re done with it?” Or “Is it so difficult to take two
more steps to the closet instead of throwing your pants on the
bed?” Or maybe that was your mom yelling at you.
She’s right, and you know it. Replace the book on the shelf when
you’re done with it; place your coffee cup in the sink after you’ve
taken the last sip; and put the clean clothes back in the drawers 
as soon as you fold them — just finishing up the job that you’ve
started goes a long way in minimizing your cleaning effort.
Part II: Getting to Work 
48

When you’re in a hurry getting out the door in the morning, 
being tidy may be impossible and simply another stressor. If that’s
the case, resolve to do a quick pickup when you get home, or, 
as many families do, reserve Saturday mornings for a general
housecleaning. So tidying as you go is recommended, but slippage
(just as in a diet) is normal. Be kind to yourself.
Creating a Functional 
Recycling Area
Recycling services and the materials they accept vary by location:
Some enlightened cities offer comprehensive and convenient 
recycling pickup, allowing homeowners to commingle materials
(paper, plastic, glass, all together) and dump them into a single
container. In other places, no pickup exists, and residents are on
their own in finding drop-off recycling locations. Base your home
recycling system on your unique circumstances.
A well-placed recycling operation encourages household members
to use it more frequently and reduces the amount of trash you 
produce. Several acquaintances have become so successful at
their recycling efforts, they’ve converted their household trash
cans into recycling bins and generate no more than one produce
bag of garbage weekly.
Setting up your recycling center
Ideally, if you have space in your kitchen pantry area, set up your
recycling receptacles there so they’re at hand when you need 
them most. As you finish off a plastic bottle of cranberry juice, for
example, you can simply rinse it out and toss it in the plastics bin.
Another practical place to put your recycling center is the laundry
or utility room, also a big producer of recyclable output.
If space doesn’t permit recycling in either of these locations, 
the garage is a reasonable alternative. Do avoid, however, 
keeping recycling outside where it can attract pets, pests, and
uninvited wildlife.
Plastic recycling: Easy as 1, 2, 3?
Despite the fact that most plastics can be recycled, dedicated 
environmentalists often have a hard time finding a source that
accepts many of the plastic containers that once held their
ketchup, shampoo, or chicken thighs.
Chapter 4: An Ounce of Prevention 49

Here’s why: Not all plastics are created equal. Most are identified
by a code — a triangle with a number in the middle — that 
appears somewhere on the item. The number indicates the type 
of plastic it is.
Plastic #1 is made of polyethylene terephthalate, familiar to most
as PETE or PET. It’s used for soft drink bottles and other common
containers and is highly recyclable, often used to make new 
bottles, as well as fiberfill for jackets, cassette tapes, and plastic
furniture.
Plastic #6, on the other hand, is polystyrene, of which Styrofoam is
made. These plastics can be recycled into other objects, but fewer
sources accept them.
A petroleum-based material, plastic also demands a polluting
process to manufacture. To maximize your efforts to conserve
energy and resources, your best bet is to simply reduce the amount
of short-lived plastic products and other plastic-packaged items
you purchase. When possible, try to choose products contained in
the plastics most commonly accepted — plastics #1 and #2, shown
in Figure 4-1. Then, seek out any local sources that accept plastics
#3 through #7.
Figure 4-1: The number within the triangle-shaped arrow found on 
plastic items identifies the type of plastic and its recyclability.
Divide and conquer
If your recycling services allow you to commingle, great! You may
be able to stick to a single bin for all your materials, if it’s picked
Part II: Getting to Work 
50

up frequently enough. Most services, whether curbside pickup or
drop-off, do require some sorting. And even if commingling is per-
mitted, it’s sometimes just easier to separate. After all, newspapers
stack more neatly segregated from the plastic and other materials.
Consider separate collection containers for the most common
materials:
 Newspapers (if your primary service doesn’t accept 
other paper)
 Office paper, catalogs, and junk mail
 Plastics #1 and #2 (when your primary service only accepts
these two common materials — refer to Figure 4-1)
 Plastics #3 through #7 (if you have a recycling source for 
them — refer to Figure 4-1)
 Aluminum and metal food and beverage containers
 Glass food containers
You can find plenty of purpose-made recycling bins: some stack-
able, and some on wheels for easy delivery to the curb. But you
don’t have to invest in a fancy system. Save those big-bucket cat
litter or pet food containers, collect plastic milk crates from thrift
shops or garage sales, or reuse an extra garbage bin. The poetic
irony? Those petroleum-based plastic containers are now serving
the noble purpose of recycling other plastic!
Setting up for advanced recycling
Set up an additional bin for other recyclables: items not accepted
by your primary service, but taken by other sources. Businesses
that salvage metal may accept items as diverse as lawn mowers
and jack-in-the-box toys. Other enterprises seek computers, 
televisions, appliances, and electronics either to fix and donate or
to deconstruct for the reusable parts. Some recyclable items are
 Computers, cell phones, and electronics accepted by compa-
nies and services that either repair, donate, or “deconstruct”
items for reusable parts and safely dispose of the toxic 
components.
 Some Styrofoam, including packing peanuts, accepted by
some shipping companies. Federal Express, for example,
accepts packing materials at many of its franchises 
throughout the United States.
Chapter 4: An Ounce of Prevention 51

 Metals, such as loose parts from broken appliances, that some
salvage companies are likely to accept.
 Hazardous materials, such as pesticides, expired or unused
pharmaceuticals, batteries, mercury thermometers, and CLF
light bulbs, which contain mercury.
Because these items may be bigger or pose more safety issues
than your typical recyclables, place this container outside your
house on a porch or in the garage away from auto gas tanks, 
furnaces, and pilot lights. Also, be prepared to empty this bin 
frequently, as you want to get toxic or dangerous chemicals or
materials to a place where they can be disposed of safely.
A Cleaning Plan Worth 
Its Weight in Dust
When faced with a houseful of rooms demanding to be cleaned,
you can become so overwhelmed you don’t know where to begin.
Maybe you start by picking up the dirty clothes on the bathroom
floor and taking them to the laundry room, where you stop to 
fold socks that take you next to your bedroom to put them away.
The dirty mirror distracts you, and you head into the kitchen for
the window cleaner, and stop to finish up the breakfast dishes and
then. . . .
You get my drift. When you hop from room to room, putting a
single pair of socks away or wiping down one piece of furniture at a
time, you may be multitasking or merely running around in circles.
What you need is a plan. A method. A strategy. There are plenty of
great ones: Cleaning strategies are certainly not one-size-fits-all.
Trial and error will tell what works for you. But all good plans have
certain components.
A practical sequence
If you were making a shirt, you wouldn’t sew the buttons on before
you cut the material out from the pattern. Likewise, when you
plunge into a dirty house, there’s a logical order to cleaning. You
wouldn’t, for example, mop the floor before you sweep it. Each
home is different, but the order follows some universal principles:
Part II: Getting to Work 
52

 Clean from the top down. Dust the ceiling corners and light-
ing fixtures and the tops of picture frames. Then clean the
windows, and finally the window frames and sills. Wipe up 
any smudges on the walls or light switch plates, dust the 
furniture, and sweep or mop the floor.
If you start from the floor and work up, by the time you get to
waist-level cleaning, you’re sweeping toast crumbs off the
counter onto your clean floor.
 Work your way through the house. When doing a whole-
house clean, move from room to room in a sequential order.
Say that you have a two-story home: Start on the second floor
in the room farthest from the stairs and work toward them,
cleaning the hallway floor as you make your final trip toward
the steps.
Then start on the first floor, working from the room farthest
from the kitchen or laundry room — whichever place you
must return to for more water or cleaning supplies as needed.
 Prioritize “public” areas. If you have frequent visitors, start
with the rooms and areas your guests are most likely to 
see: the main floor entry area, powder room, living room, and
kitchen.
 Go around in circles. A good strategy for cleaning a single
room is to work in a circle. Start to the left or the right of the
door or entrance and make a clockwise or counterclockwise
circle around the room.
What about the center? Most rooms are small enough that
your efforts can be somewhat pie-shaped, stepping from the
perimeter to catch any furniture placed closer to the center of
the room. By following this methodical path, you’re less likely
to have overlooked a corner or a piece of furniture.
I tend to notice dust when I am sitting down watching televi-
sion or reading on the couch. Dust is revealed when the light
hits table tops and shelves a certain way. So after cleaning,
take a break and look around. Something obvious that you
missed may stick out at you.
 Group by task. Here’s another plan of attack: Instead of
moving through the house room by room, approach your
cleaning one task at a time. For example, begin with your dust
rag and wood cleaner and dust everything in several rooms.
Put that down and pick up the window cleaner and do the 
mirrors and so on. This approach is really my favorite.
Bundling your chores can be a very efficient approach: Once
you’ve finished with all the vacuuming, for example, you can
put away the vacuum instead of leaving it out until you’re
ready to use it in the next room.
Chapter 4: An Ounce of Prevention 53

A surefire spring cleaning strategy
Ah, spring! In cultures ancient and traditional, spring holidays 
have celebrated the renewal of life through food, festivity — and
cleaning rituals. Doors and windows are opened, the sun is 
welcomed in, and homes are given a good airing.
According to a survey conducted by the Soap and Detergent
Association, 77 percent of Americans participate in spring cleaning
each year. Out with the old, in with the new!
And the new may include a fresh approach to cleaning. As moti-
vated as you may be to tackle your spring housework, the 
prospect of overhauling your home from top to bottom is a bit
intimidating — overwhelming even. A more strategic attack, using
some of the tactics I cover in the previous section of this chapter,
is likely to bring about the results you want — a spanking-clean,
fresh-smelling, tidy-to-the-tiniest-detail home — with less exhaus-
tion and effort. In addition, add these tips to your arsenal of spring
cleaning wisdom:
 Spread it out. Don’t try to power through your entire home-
stead, from window washing to attic-purging, in one weekend.
To do a thorough job of spring cleaning without losing
momentum, divide the chores and spread the work out over 
a month — even more.
 Practice patience. Take on the tasks as they make sense. Wait
on washing the windows for a cloudy day (fewer streaks than
on a sunny day) or cleaning out the fireplace if more winter
storm activity is likely. Repaint the living room first and then
replace the old carpet with a new bamboo floor.
 Don’t go it alone. If your housemates and family members
aren’t reliable members of the housekeeping team, then sign
on a free agent: Enlist the help of a cleaning service, especially
for the most demanding jobs. Better the licensed experts
climb on the ladder to dust your chandelier and clean the 
skylight, and you polish your heirloom silver.
A quick run-through 
on speed cleaning
When I was in high school, I read an article in one of those maga-
zines for teenaged girls: It advised the reader, caught off-guard by 
a surprise visit from a boy, how to make herself presentable in just
Part II: Getting to Work 
54

five minutes. “Wash your face, brush your teeth, flick on some 
mascara, comb your hair, and put on lipstick” were some of the
tips I recall.
At this point in my life, if someone showed up at the door unex-
pectedly (and this is rare with cell phones), I’d be less concerned
with my makeup and more worried that my house is picked up. But
the advice is still the same: Go for the big-impact improvements
you can make in the shortest time possible.
When doing a speed cleaning, which I define as taking 15 minutes
or less, concentrate on making the most visible changes and 
lessening the most obnoxious offenders. Banish bad smells from
cat litter, diaper pails, or garbage first and follow up with an overall
whirlwind house attack that targets the big stuff:
1. Pick up stray glasses and dishes, newspapers, and clothes
strewn about and neaten piles of magazines.
2. Get the dishes in the dishwasher or place them in soapy
water in the sink.
3. Wipe down the countertop.
4. Tidy up the primary rooms of occupancy: the living room
or family room and kitchen.
Zone your house so that the bedrooms are off limits or at
least the master bedroom and bathroom are off limits to
nonfamily visitors. Close the door. If open, make the bed.
5. Make a quick sweep of the most “public” bathroom, the
one guests use, and wipe down the sink, counters,
mirror, and toilet.
I’ll never forget seeing a man’s set of briefs (assume her husband’s)
soaking in the sink in an upstairs bathroom at a fancy party. The
hostess said, “Use the bathroom upstairs.” I’m sure she had no
idea and would have been mortified.
Seeking Professional Help
The most effective way to reduce your cleaning efforts? Let 
someone else do the work. There’s no shortage of housecleaning
services in the phone book or notices in your mailbox. But until
recently, most of them, whether national franchises or local busi-
nesses, were anything but green. Driven primarily by a clientele
who wanted clean at any cost, such enterprises typically chose
Chapter 4: An Ounce of Prevention 55

cleaning products that clean fast and powerfully. No surprise, most
services used powerful products with bleach, ammonia, and other
fossil-fuel based or eye-watering powerful chemicals.
That’s changing, and changing fast. Housecleaning companies 
that offer green services are popping up from coast to coast, some
estimates indicate that they may make up half of the cleaning 
services on the West Coast.
But before you pay a premium for green service, do a little digging
to find out exactly how that company differentiates itself.
 If the service claims to use “green” cleaning formulas, find out
what they are. If their brand’s labeled “nontoxic,” “natural,” or
“biodegradable,” be wary as these labels may not mean much.
Remember, manufacturers don’t have to list ingredients on
the label. (See Chapter 3 for more about what makes a cleaner
truly environmentally friendly.)
 Find out whether the company is committed to sustainable
business practices. In addition to its choice of cleaning 
products, does the business attempt to reduce its environ-
mental footprint by considering transportation issues and
building operations? Does it offset for the carbon emissions 
it generates?
 Ask what else the business does to define itself as green. Are
the employees cognizant of water usage, conserving where
possible and using cooler water when it makes sense? 
Do they clean without electronic appliances? Do they clean
with reusable tools: cloth rags instead of paper towels?
If the greenness of the cleaning products is your primary issue,
consider sticking with a conventional service and ask that they
switch to your cleaning products. Most are happy to use whatever
products you specify, whether your homemade recipes or 
green-brand formulas.

 Clearing the air about room fresheners and fragrances
P
eek into a green cleaning closet, and you won’t see a dramatic
difference from a conventional collection of cleaning tools 
and equipment: dust rags, brooms, mops, sponges, and a vacuum
cleaner. But the differences are there; they just happen to be on a
more subtle level. The sustainable sensibility may be reflected in
the type of dust cloths, or the amount of mops and brooms, or the
content of the trash bags.
In this chapter, I explore these sometimes-subtle differences as I
give you a rundown of just what tools and hardware belong in the
green utility closet, from stuff as basic as old towels for cleaning
rags to the latest gadgets that make quick work of cleaning.
Checklist for a Well-Stocked Closet
Every good utility closet ought to contain fundamental cleaning
hardware. Quantities, quality, styles, and sizes may change
depending upon location, climate, lifestyle, and the square footage
of the home. But the basic cleaning checklist is the same for any
abode. From there, it gets as creative as you want it to.
Home care needn’t be a complicated matter. Sure, the home 
stores carry all kinds of fancy cleaning tools: Who knew that you
needed a dedicated brush for baseboards and a brush exclusively
for ceiling fans? The best cleaning toolkit, however, is a matter 
of fundamentals. Have the equipment on this list at the ready, and
you’re well prepared to clean anything in your home:

❑Cleaning cloths
❑Bucket
❑Indoor broom
❑Outdoor broom
❑Dust mop
❑Sponge mop
❑Dust pan with brush
❑Whiskbroom
❑Stiff scrub brush
❑Very soft brush
❑Sponges
❑Toilet brush
❑Plunger
❑Bottlebrush
❑Vacuum cleaner with attachments
❑Drying rack for indoors
❑Clothesline for outdoors
❑Clothespins
❑Extra spray bottles
❑Trash bags
Other gadgets and tools may not be essential to your cleaning
efforts, but they can make the job easier, faster, less “dirty,” or
more fun. Consider the following to enhance and round out your
cleaning supply closet:
 Rubber gloves
 Aprons
 Tote to carry hardware and cleaners from room to room
 Hand-held vacuum
 Steam cleaner
 Deep laundry sink
 Old toothbrushes
 Mop and dusting systems or kits
 Squeegee for the shower door
Part II: Getting to Work 
58

I don’t encourage accumulating all these accoutrements: For one
thing, owning and storing more stuff isn’t exactly high on the list of
green ideals. But while owning them all means more clutter in your
closet and — I guarantee it — plenty of equipment that gets used
as frequently as that fondue pot in the garage, you may find a few
of these products helpful.
Greening Your Cleaning Closet
The first rule when assembling the greenest cleaning equipment is
the environmentalist’s first commandment: Thou shall reduce,
reuse, and recycle. Secondly, work with what you have. Instead of
tossing and replacing, repair and reuse. And, lastly, when your 
old equipment is finally ready to go to the utility closet in the sky,
recycle everything that you can.
Remember that buying isn’t a green activity. But for those tools 
you must acquire, seek products made of ecofriendly materials or
of recycled content. Look for items with minimal packaging —
more and more, such wrappings may be identified as recyclable,
biodegradable, or compostable.
Tackling dirty jobs: Cleaning cloths
Cleaning cloths are the workhorses of your housecleaning kit. 
If you have nothing else in your utility closet but towels and 
rags, you have all you need to attack most cleaning jobs. 
(See Chapter 6 for cleaning-agent recipes that pair up well with
your cleaning cloths.)
These multipurpose fundamentals can tackle just about any 
household job, including
 Dusting, wet or dry
 Wiping down appliances and furnishings
 Mopping floors
 Cleaning tile and kitchen and bathroom surfaces
 Shining chrome
 Sopping up spills
 Polishing silver
 Cleaning glass and mirrors
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 59

Hanging up a damp towel to reuse risks growing and spreading
bacteria. Solve this issue by frequently switching out towels and
washing them in hot water.
Working with the right material
Options for cleaning cloths are endless: On the market are pack-
ages of clothlike throwaway towels; heavy-duty, purpose-made
cleaning cloths; products with antimicrobial properties; microfiber
wipes; and paper towels. And then there are old, worn T-shirts,
towels, and sheets that have been repurposed.
The best cleaning choice is the cloth that picks up the most 
dirt without streaking, spreading, smearing, or leaving behind
muddy trails. Certain fabrics do a better job than others. In my
experience, I find that these materials bring superior results:
 Wool: Ideal for dusting, wool contains lanolin and has static
electricity properties, attracting dust and keeping hold of it
more so than other fabrics.
 Cotton: The soft, absorbent nature of pure cotton makes it a
great choice for almost any cleaning job.
 Microfiber: Its fine filaments pick up dust, dirt, and oil and
boast a high absorbency factor, able to hold up to seven times
its weight in water.
Don’t toss the sheets, though. They make great outdoor furniture
covers and paint tarps.
Repurposing old clothes: The greenest option
One standout choice for cleaning rags meets the highest green
standards: Old clothes require no additional output of energy
(other than your effort to cut them into rag-size pieces); you don’t
have to buy them; they require no wasteful packaging; they’re not
damaging to the environment; and you’re exercising the principle
of reuse. And if you’re using old towels or T-shirts made of organic
cotton, chalk up even more green points.
Used fabrics make outstanding cleaning aids. They’ve been washed
to a smooth softness, with less lint and loose fibers. Cut up an 
old wool blanket or reuse hole-ridden wool socks (just slip them
on your hands) for dusting; convert old cotton towels, baby 
diapers, and soft cotton T-shirts and nightwear into scrub rags.
Remove any buttons or zippers because they scratch surfaces.
Buying new cleaning cloths
One benefit of buying new cleaning cloths rather than repurposing:
You can choose colors to separate cloths for different uses. I keep
separate cloths for dusting and wet-wiping. I have yet another pile
Part II: Getting to Work 
60

reserved for the dirtiest jobs — cleaning the toilet, for example.
The ability to color-coordinate makes keeping cloths separate 
a lot easier.
Green-wise, look for 100-percent organic cotton towels. Organic
towels often cost more than conventional towels because the natu-
ral materials used are grown without the use of most pesticides,
synthetic fertilizers, or genetic engineering. Most organic towels
are 100-percent cotton or a blend with cotton and another natural
fiber, such as linen or hemp. To verify that the product is organic,
look for the USDA certified organic symbol. Another green choice
is bamboo. Yes, that sturdy, woody, rapidly renewable grass can be
transformed into the softest fabric. Its antibacterial qualities make
it a perfect choice for dish towels.
Getting attached to microfiber
Microfiber cleaning cloths are another option, available from a
number of brands. Though derived from petroleum, polyester-
polyamide-based microfiber materials are worth their weight 
in water — they’re super-absorbent and scoop up dirt like iron
shavings attracted to a magnet. You can reuse most of them, and
some are specialized to tackle
 Granite, picking up dirt and dulling residue, and leaving 
a shine
 Wood, attracting and trapping dust
 Windows/glass, cleaning and adding gleam
 Stainless steel, removing smudges, fingerprints, and streaks
 Floors, picking up dust, dirt, and debris with mop pads or
sweep dusters
But most importantly, their performance is first-rate. They get
better all the time. A few makers offer a greened-up version of
microfiber. Method’s sweeping cloths, for example, are made of
compostable corn-based material.
Shredding the use of paper towel
Anything that ends up in the trash after a single use doesn’t rate
very high on the green-o-meter. And paper towels are the ultimate
in discard-ability.
Rolled up inside every package of paper towel is a dirty back-story.
The paper industry is one of the world’s worst polluters, keeping
company with chemical and steel manufacturing. And very little
paper towel is recycled, of course. Instead, it contributes to the 40
percent of landfill content from paper.
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 61

Because wood pulp is the basis for paper, its production has an
impact on deforestation, which adds to global warming. And the
manufacturing of paper towel, in addition to bearing a heavy 
environmental footprint, involves bleaching with chlorine-based
chemicals, which can lead to the release of toxic emissions, 
causing further damage.
Cleaning cloths can pinch-hit for virtually any job that paper towel
can handle. They’re washable, and you can use them again and
again. Save your most tattered and faded dishtowels and other 
soft cloths to use for the dirtiest jobs, giving them one last shot at
service before discarding them.
Most of my extreme-green acquaintances do keep a roll of paper
towel around, but they use it judiciously, not for everyday use. And
they choose their paper towel brands just as carefully.
If you decide that your home can’t function without paper 
towels, you’re in good company. Some steps do help lessen the
environmental impact:
 Seek products with the highest percentage of post-consumer
waste (PCW). This figure indicates the amount of material 
that came from paper used and recycled by consumers —
mail-order catalogs and magazines you’re finished with or the
used copy paper from your office, for example. Using PCW
encourages more markets for recycled products (translate:
more places to take your recycled paper). Most recycled-
content products include some recycled content from 
manufacturing waste, referred to as preconsumer waste. For
example, Seventh Generation paper towels use 80-percent
PCW and 20 percent preconsumer waste.
 Choose unbleached paper towel, identified by the label 
PCF (processed chlorine free), to ensure that no chlorine
derivatives were used in the processing of the paper.
 Select products free of dyes and fragrances.
 Buy the largest quantity with the least amount of packaging.
Double rolls make more sense than single rolls.
Exploring an absorbing 
issue: Sponges
An ideal ally for soaking up wet messes, sponges suck up water so
that you can transfer it into the sink with a good squeeze. Time
was when the sponges used for cleaning were from the amorphous,
Part II: Getting to Work 
62

faceless sea creatures that float under the ocean’s surface like
deflating beach toys. Today, the articles you buy in hardware and
home stores are rarely made from real sponge, but rather from
some sort of polymer with petroleum origins. The microfiber
sponges, a relatively new novelty, are likewise synthetic-based.
(For an explanation of why petroleum-based products add to
global warming concerns, read Chapter 2.)
Consider what your “sponge” is made of: You may want to substi-
tute plant-based cellulose sponges for petroleum-derived products.
You may also prefer microfiber sponges, which attract and capture
bacteria better and clean more easily.
Reduce the elbow grease and cleaning solution required by choos-
ing sponges with a “scrubbing” side and sponge mops with an
abrasive strip — great for scraping away stubborn dried-on food.
The dark side of sponges
Whether plastic- or plant-based, all sponges pose a similar risk:
They’re germ carriers. Talk about a natural breeding ground! All
those little holes and dark crevices are perfect spots for germs to
hide and thrive. When you use a dirty sponge to clean a surface,
chances are you leave behind a trail of bacteria even as you pick
up the mess.
Some companies have countered the sponge’s dirty reputation by
soaking their products with antibacterial agents, typically the
ingredient triclosan. Avoid this ingredient! Triclosan has not been
proven to be any more effective than soap and warm water in
killing germs. It’s also suspected of contributing to the spread of
drug-resistant bacteria. Finally, when in contact with chlorine, 
triclosan can become chloroform, a probable human carcinogen.
Practicing sponge safety
Don’t write sponges off completely. These guys are redeemable
and worth the effort because of their super-hero absorption
powers. They just require a little more attention. Follow these
practices for safe sponging:
 Buy cellulose sponges or long-lasting microfiber products for
the greenest options. (The packaging usually identifies the
contents as such.)
 After each use, wash the sponge in hot soapy water or spray it
with a solution of white distilled vinegar.
 Set the sponge on a kitchen windowsill so that sunlight and its
magical disinfecting properties can dry it.
 Wash the sponge often in the washing machine. Warmer water
is preferred.
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 63

 Use common sense: Keep the bathroom sponges only in 
bathrooms, and the kitchen sponges only in the kitchen, and
then specify their use for wiping crumbs off the table and
range top or for rinsing out the sink.
Clean sponges in the dishwasher or boil them in water for three
minutes. Another solution is to microwave them for one to three
minutes, making sure that they’re wet before you “nuke” them.
Using hot water to get at the holes and crevices is important for
thorough cleaning. Even following these practices, you want to
replace sponges frequently. When the dirt discoloration appears
permanent and the sponge starts to disintegrate, it’s time to toss.
Brushing up on other cleaning tools
No other product in the cleaning closet offers such diversity as
brooms and brushes. On one Web site, I marveled at the range of
single-purpose tools: brushes expressly for cleaning baseboards,
cobweb brushes, ceiling fan brushes, carpet rakes, dryer vent and
lint trap brushes, grout brushes, and an intriguingly long garbage
disposal brush. Although I question the necessity of some of these
brushes, the abundance of product does reflect the importance of
brushes to good housekeeping.
Usually brooms and brushes are relatively inexpensive, and the
tendency is to keep them forever.
Sweeping changes
No green home is complete without the traditional good-luck gift, a
broom, for new homeowners. Although more cleanup jobs are
handed over to the vacuum cleaner these days, the broom still
earns its keep for sweeping up. A broom comes in handy when the
power is out, or when you simply find the meditative motion of
sweeping relaxing. You can use the standard-style broom or 
a push broom, typically reserved for outdoor or major jobs, such
as sweeping the garage or sweeping leaves off the driveway.
The no-plug broom is by its very nature a green cleaning tool. 
That brooms are traditionally made of natural and abundant 
material such as straw — from sorghum and often referred 
to as broomcorn — and wooden handles adds to their 
sustainable allure.
Many brooms found in hardware and big box stores are plastic-
based, with nylon brushes and plastic or metal handles, but plenty
of the traditional models are available. In fact, Home Depot has
committed to using FSC-certified wood, even on broom handles.
(For more on FSC certification, see Chapter 10.)
Part II: Getting to Work 
64

Don’t use a broom to sweep a hardwood floor. The brush, whether
natural-material or nylon, can scratch the surface. You’re better 
off using the vacuum or dust mop to round up dust bunnies.
Nylon brooms or other lightweight smoother finished brooms are
best for inside use, such as for tile floors. Straw brooms, however,
work fine indoors, too. And the rougher texture of the brush is
especially effective on uneven surfaces, such as outdoor brick
patios. The unevenness of the straw gets into the cracks and
crevices between the bricks. Shake brooms outside to clean them.
Choose brushes with green cleaning
When you remove the harsh chemical agents from your cleaning
arsenal, you’re compelled to use a little more elbow grease to get
some surfaces and furnishings as clean as the chemicals do. The
tough scrubbing power of brushes can up your cleaning power,
using agents as mild as plain water.
Scrub brushes — those hand-held tools with blocks of wood, 
plastic, or metal and bristles of varying stiffness — are a valuable
tool in the green home. A good stiff scrub brush can tackle scuffed
kitchen floors, mildewed tile grout, grease-coated ovens, and 
brick or stone floors and surfaces. You can also use it for sweeping
(a push-broom is, in essence, a scrub brush with a handle). You
can use soft-bristled brushes for picking up dust and cleaning 
delicate objects and surfaces.
Every green home should have the following brushes in the utility
closet or appropriate spot in the house:
 Stiff-bristled scrub brushes — both indoor and outdoor — 
for scouring and scrubbing tough surfaces
 Soft-bristled brush for cleaning fragile furnishings and for
dusting and polishing
 Toilet brush
 Vegetable brush, for cleaning potatoes and other produce
 Bottlebrush for thoroughly cleaning long, narrow-necked 
containers from baby bottles to flower vases and reaching
into garbage disposals, drains, and even dryer vents.
Before buying a custom-use brush for small jobs, tap your medi-
cine chest and bathroom toiletry cabinet first. Toothbrushes are
great for getting into the tiny crevices of blenders or taking lint 
off hair-dryer vents. Old makeup brushes are soft and gentle for
dusting the curves and hard-to-reach spots on antique furniture.
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 65

Not your mother’s mop
Unless you’re partial to housemaid’s knee, floor mops and dusters
are must-haves. Most floor mops have a sponge on the end that
has a scraper edge to get up crusted-on food or dirt. They pair
nicely with a bucket of soapy water. Dust mops, on the other hand,
are based on a fringy head or microfiber cloth to pick up dry dust
and loose particles.
Mops both wet and dry have evolved, overcoming some objections
to their performance. One of the biggest trends in floor cleaning 
is the “mop system.” An all-in-one kit includes the mop handle,
mop head, and removable cloths that attach to the mop head.
Some systems also feature an “onboard” refillable cleaning solution
dispenser — as you mop, you can press a button to squirt out
cleaning liquid from the mop head.
Until recently, most mop systems used disposable mop cloths:
You’d use them a couple times and then toss them. But as 
consumers and companies become more attuned to sustainability
issues, these throwaways are increasingly replaced by reusable
cloths, most often made of microfiber material.
Microfiber means harder-working and longer-lasting cloths for
both wet and dry mopping. These qualities earn microfiber, while a
synthetic material, plenty of green points. Additionally, some
makers manufacture their microfiber from post-consumer content;
and some cloths are recyclable or biodegradable.
Trashing plastic bags
As more communities, including countries from Ireland to China,
impose bans, fines, and restrictions on the plastic grocery bag, its
bigger relative, the trash bag, continues to raise environmental
debate.
Used for purposes from collecting leaves to gathering kitchen
garbage, these larger trash bags have the same drawbacks as the
smaller offenders: They’re made from petroleum-based synthetics,
so both extraction and manufacture contribute to greenhouse gas
emissions.
In addition, trash bags are used almost exclusively for disposal,
which means that they’re adding to the growing landfill and 
possibly preventing compostable and biodegradable materials
from decomposing.
Part II: Getting to Work 
66

For a number of reasons, trash bags are near essential to even the
greenest consumer. Some community trash pickups require that
materials be bagged rather than set out loose in trash containers
to discourage animals. And few people have been able to reduce
their household footprint to the point that they’re no longer 
generating trash. Thus, the trash bag conundrum.
One way to cut down on your use of plastic trash bags is to 
ratchet up your recycling efforts to reduce your waste output. 
(See Chapter 4 for ideas on setting up an efficient recycling 
collection center.) In addition, follow these steps and watch your
use of trash bags shrink:
 Compost kitchen scraps. You can turn fruit and vegetable
trimmings, coffee grounds, tea leaves, eggshells, and some
other materials into rich garden soil in your backyard. (See
Chapter 7 for more about composting.)
 Limit the use of trash liners to only those receptacles that
collect wet or drippy garbage. For smaller cans, such as
those in the bedroom or living areas, eliminate the trash 
bag. Many waste cans now come with a removable, washable
plastic liner (ah, more plastic!) so that you don’t have to 
continue to use small liner bags.
 Use bags you already have, such as brown paper bags from
grocery stores, tired-looking gift bags, and department store
bags, for trash. This option is green because you’re recycling,
but it’s a less green option because you shouldn’t have these
items in the first place if you’ve converted to taking your own
cloth bags to the store.
 Designate the lined trash bin as the home’s “central” 
receptacle and empty the smaller bins into this one. That
way, you can limit your weekly bag use to one.
 Look for biodegradable trash bags. These bags are made
from corn or other renewable sources, and many manufactur-
ers advertise that they can biodegrade in a compost bin in
just days. Even if you set them out for your weekly trash
pickup, at least they’re breaking down in the landfill.
Plugging In Green Gadgets
The best energy source for green cleaning is, of course, your own
sweat equity. But some technological tools are too valuable and
effective to do without. Especially where indoor air quality is 
concerned, nothing picks up dirt and filters irritants as well as a
well-made vacuum cleaner.
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 67

And not to worry: While a vacuum does eat up some kilowatt hours,
the measurement of energy for plug-ins from clothes irons to 
computers, one source estimates that average use of the appliance
results in as little as 12 kilowatts a year (compared to 1,500 for a
refrigerator and 4,000 for an air conditioner). A few other plug-in
cleaning aids merit consideration, too.
A clean sweep of vacuum cleaners
A regular sweep through the home with your vacuum cleaner does
wonders for reducing problems related to poor indoor air quality,
particularly with issues of dust mites, dander, and other irritants.
Specialized vacuums suck up pet hair.
The new kid on the block is the Halo vacuum. It has a built-in 
ultraviolet light bulb that disrupts the DNA of viruses, bacteria,
flea eggs, and dust mites. When vacuuming, you activate the light.
The Halo vacuum is suggested for cleaning carpets and mattresses.
Similar technology is being used in heating and air-conditioning
ducts. Anywhere it is dark and dusty, the idea is to shine light 
on the potential problem. (Stay tuned on this one because the 
scientific tests and reviews are still underway.)
The micron is the measure of the microscopic particulates that find
their way into air passages. The best machine is one that includes
a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, which can pick up
99.97 percent of particulates as small as .3 microns, the size of cat
dander, including such irritants as dust mite droppings (10 to 20
microns) and pollen, weighing in at a whopping 15 to 25 microns.
They can also catch chemical pollutants such as flame-retardants,
phthalates, and pesticides.
The vacuum cleaner is an investment in your home’s air quality,
but it won’t help much if it isn’t routinely put into service and
maintained. Be sure to take these steps to properly use and care
for your appliance:
 Vacuum often: once a week or more frequently if someone in
your home has allergies, or if you have pets.
 Vacuum more in areas with high foot traffic, such as the area
in front of your couch.
 Change bags or canisters before they’re full to avoid 
spilling dirt.
 Replace the filters and maintain the vacuum cleaner 
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Part II: Getting to Work 
68

 Assist your vacuum cleaner with its chore by dusting 
furniture regularly (less dust to fall on the floor) and taking 
off shoes before tracking dirt onto floors and carpets.
 When carrying, grip the vacuum by the handle, not the hose.
 Remove hair entangling the brushes.
 If you’re using a bagless vacuum, empty the canister outside
to help alleviate any allergen concerns and wipe the vacuum
cleaner with a slightly damp cloth.
 Use appropriately attachments:
• The all-purpose or universal brush works well on books
and shelves.
• The crevice tool (long and thin) reaches into narrow
slots and corners.
• The dusting brush details items that need a soft touch.
• The radiator brush cleans radiators and narrow spaces.
• The upholstery nozzle, as its name implies, is good for
vacuuming chairs, sofas, cushions, drapes, mattresses,
and fabric furniture covers.
Investing in the best vacuum cleaner you need and can afford
makes environmental sense. The embodied energy that went into
manufacturing it certainly warrants its good care and long life. 
A model with a lifetime warranty is something to look for. Also, 
buy from a company that you can purchase parts or repairs from
rather than simply replace the vacuum down the road.
Heating things up: Steam cleaners
A clean and chemical-free way of cleaning, steam cleaners are 
especially good for zapping dirt embedded in carpet, rugs, and 
fabrics, such as draperies, upholstery, mattresses, and bedding.
In particular, steam cleaners are known to wipe out dust mites and
clean up the microscopic messes that irritate allergy sufferers. 
By targeting dirt with steam heat at 240°F, steam cleaners exceed
anything that the clothes washer may aspire to.
Use steam cleaners for wiping up all traces of pet stain, mildew,
and mold. They clean most surfaces and get into grout like nothing
else can. Read and follow instructions carefully before using.
Remember that steam cleaners are not vacuum cleaners: Dust or
pick up loose dirt before steaming, and vacuum before using the
steam cleaners.
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 69

The steam generated can cause bad burns. Some reports suggest
that some of the smaller hand-helds may be more prone to 
causing burns because of malfunctions. Be sure to research models
carefully and read consumer reviews before purchasing.
Clearing the air
An air purifier isn’t a cleaning closet type piece of equipment, 
but the subject of air purifiers comes up for those who suffer 
from persistent and misery-inducing allergies. While air-purifiers
can certainly have an effect on the home’s indoor air quality,
they’re not a cureall and have some cost disadvantages, one being
that they consume a lot of energy. One report indicates that an 
air-purifier can add anywhere from $60 to $200 to your utility 
bill a year.
Before investing in an air purifier, the American Lung Association
advises taking steps to reduce dust and dirt and eliminate chemi-
cal irritants first. Advice covered throughout this book includes
 Vacuuming frequently
 Dusting regularly
 Washing bedding, curtains, and rugs often
 Replacing furnishings and household products that release
chemicals and volatile organic compounds into the air
 Making sure that the home is well-ventilated, opening 
windows for air circulation, and ensuring that bathroom 
and kitchen air vents work
 Using a house fan to circulate air
 Reducing humidity through ventilation and a dehumidifier, if
necessary
If you decide that an air-purifier is for you, you can find more 
information about various options and energy-efficiency ratings at
the Energy Star Web site, www.energystar.com.
Sniffing Out Room Fresheners
Not only do most people measure clean by the looks of a place, 
but they also judge it by its smell. The contemporary tendency to
cover up odors with artificial spray-can scents harkens to earlier
times in history: I’ve read that in 16th-century England, Henry VIII,
rather than bathe regularly (a practice considered unhealthy),
Part II: Getting to Work 
70

splashed on more colognes and perfumes. I can’t help but imagine
how 21st-century noses would have certainly sniffed out the truth
pretty quickly.
Nice smells don’t equal clean, however. In fact, they can spell
indoor air quality issues. Many of the aerosol spray room 
fresheners propel the chemicals used to create the scent in such
small particles that they can easily make their way into your 
air passages and lungs. (If you think that the name “lavender-
meadows” means there’s real lavender in the can, think again!)
Some of the sprays are merely overbearingly strong.
Even candles are guilty when it comes to indoor air quality. The
smoke they produce creates particulates that can enter air 
passages and cause irritation and distress to those with respira-
tory problems. And the wire that supports the wick? Some foreign
manufacturers use lead. When burned, the substance enters 
your airways and is no better for you in this form than if you ate
lead paint.
To add insult to injury, candles are most commonly made of 
petroleum-based paraffin, known to burn “dirty” compared to 
natural candles made of beeswax, palm oil, or soy.
Cleaning the air in your home is better accomplished by the 
following methods rather than covering up bad odors with yet
more fragrances, whether sprayed, burned, or plugged in.
 Open the windows and let the fresh air in.
 Open curtains or blinds to get some sun exposure, which
does its part to freshen.
 Get rid of odors by removing the source or cleaning.
 Set an open box of baking soda in the room to absorb odors.
 Limit candle burning to those made of beeswax, soy, or 
palm-oil, making sure that they contain all-cotton (no-lead)
wicks. Avoid burning in a drafty area to prevent fires.
 Create your own natural scents with favorites such as 
lavender buds, citrus oils, and mint oils. (See Chapter 6 for
recipes for air fresheners.)
Don’t assume that you won’t have a reaction to natural scents
made from essential oils. These oils are quite strong and may 
irritate the skin. Don’t put these oils directly on your skin. Use 
in small amounts until you determine whether you or anyone else
has a reaction to them.
Chapter 5: Assembling Your Hardware 71

Cleaning the Cleaning Supplies
Some equipment requires routine attention, whether to make sure
that it’s in top working order or kept clean.
 Wash all rags after every cleaning by popping them into the
clothes washer.
 Sponges can go on the top shelf of the dishwasher for a 
hot-water cleaning.
 Microfiber pads can be damaged by bleach and fabric sof-
tener. Read the instructions on the pads for the best way to
maintain them.
 All cloths and sponges can be air-dried.

Patronizing green-minded companies
Spending your money on green cleaning equipment is not just commerce as 
usual — it’s an opportunity to vote with your dollars, to proclaim your support of
sustainable values and send a message to all businesses to embrace greater 
corporate responsibility, especially in the realm of the environment. Make your vote
count and give your business to organizations that adhere to the highest levels of
environmental practices.
Being a green company is more than simply incorporating the color green some-
where on the product label. It means integrating green values — resource 
conservation, pursuit of cradle-to-cradle operations, net-zero impact — into the
very fabric of the corporate character.
But in an industry in which manufacturers don’t even have to list the ingredients in
their product, how do you find out more about a corporation’s practices and com-
mitment to sustainability? Finding out who’s walking the walk isn’t always easy.
To learn more about a company’s performance, visit the corporate Web site. If the
business is adhering to environmental conscientiousness at all, it promotes it here.
Check to see what certifications or labels the company has earned. Are its 
products FSC-certified? Does it have a Green Seal label? Do its products carry the
Energy Star label? Check the Appendix in this book for a list of green certifications
to look for. A certification from a third-party assessor carries more weight than the
company’s own proclamations of green-ness.

 Give brooms a good shake after every cleaning. For hard-to-
remove dander, dust, and hair, scrape against a rough surface,
such as a sidewalk, or pull off with your fingers.
 Don’t let vacuum-cleaner bags or canisters get too full; change
them before they overflow and spew dirt back into the air.
 Change HEPA filters on vacuum cleaners every few months or
according to appliance instructions.
 Follow manufacturers’ instructions for maintaining equipment.
 Don’t use broken or worn equipment.

rocery stores, warehouses, and
home-supply stores contain aisle
after aisle of commercially formulated
products, promising to clean, dust, disin-
fect, degrease, polish, shine, scour, scrub,
swab, mop, and eliminate every last bit of
dirt in your home. Who would have imag-
ined that cleaning is such a complex task
that it requires dozens of different formu-
las for each room and surface?
Fact is, these shelves of solutions contain
pretty much the same ingredients. And
many of them aren’t so good for you — or
for the planet. These ingredients are com-
monly derived from petroleum, a fossil fuel
responsible for greenhouse gas emissions,
and many of the chemicals contained in
these powerful cleaners are linked to a
host of illnesses. (Read Chapter 3 for more
about conventional commercial cleaners
and health concerns.) And to make matters
more confusing, manufacturers aren’t
required to list the ingredients on their

labels. Even products that claim to be “natural” or “gentle” may
still contain chemicals that can cause harm.
When you make your own cleaning formulas, you know exactly
what’s in them. Consider this chapter your green-clean cookbook.
Starting Simple: Taking Stock
Switching over to homemade formulas needn’t demand a major
overhaul of your cleaning habits. Remember that it’s okay to go
green by degree. Making a gradual transition may be the best strat-
egy for you. Is your utility closet crammed with barely used con-
ventional products? Or are you already on the road to a greener
cleaning practice? Start by taking stock of where you are.
As you take inventory of all your cleaning supplies, gathered from
under bathroom and kitchen sinks, the pantry, laundry room, base-
ment, garage, and linen closets, you’re bound to uncover all sorts
of half-full containers, duplicate products, and forgotten cleaners.
“Reduce” and “reuse” come before “recycle” in the environmental-
ist’s favorite refrain. That’s because the greenest thing you can do
is not buy new. So if you have a cupboard full of cleaning products,
your best bet may be to use up what you have. The resources for
manufacturing, packaging, and shipping the products have already
been spent.
That said, you may have some good reasons for discarding your
collection of cleaners:
 They contain ingredients linked to illness and health concerns,
or their ingredients are unknown, but you suspect they may
contain chemicals that cause health risks. (For a list of ingre-
dients to avoid, read Chapter 3.)
 They’re so old they’re dried up, smell strange, have taken on
an odd color, or the expiration date has passed.
 Your green principles won’t allow you to continue using them.
If you decide to discard your pre-green cleaners, be sure to dispose
of them in a responsible manner. Dumping them down the drain or
tossing them half-full in the trash isn’t the right move. Adding
these chemicals to the wastewater stream can result in contamina-
tion of water systems, and delivering them to the local landfill
means they can seep into the soil. Take the cleaners to a haz-
ardous materials collection site to ensure that they’re disposed of
safely. Read more about recycling and taking care of toxic or haz-
ardous items in Chapter 12.

76

Beginning with the basics: 
Elbow grease and water
The greenest ingredient is your own muscle power. Add a little
water, and you have a highly effective recipe for eliminating dirt.
One of my students says she always starts with water, and then if it
doesn’t work, she gets some dishwashing liquid or other mild soap.
She’s right: Water is often the best first response — with a little
scrubbing, the stain or spill is gone.
Water also happens to be the predominant ingredient in most of
the recipes in this chapter. Unless otherwise directed, use warm
water — in most cases, hot is not necessary to do the job.
Using water in the form of steam is another great way to zap dirt
and sanitize floors without chemicals. Steam mops with reusable
microfiber pads require no more than ordinary tap water to clean
slate, marble, tile, and sealed wood surfaces. Hand-held steamers
are perfect for cleaning kitchen counters and combating mold and
mildew in bath areas. And using plain steam means no cleaner
residue or buildup. (For more information about steamers and
other cleaning tools, read Chapter 5.)
Even green cleaning has its risks
Remember that all chemicals, including water and common table
salt, are toxic at some level of exposure. Additionally, some home-
grown cleaning remedies are definitely not safe. Using mayonnaise
or yogurt to clean furniture, for example, can lead to bacteria
growth. Here are a few precautions to take when making, using,
and storing homemade mixtures:
 Keep all cleaning solutions out of reach of children — on a top
shelf or in a locked cabinet.
 Don’t store cleaning formulas in reused food or beverage 
containers.
 In recipes using perishable ingredients, such as lemon juice,
make only enough for immediate use. Don’t store.
 Use steamers or hot water with caution. Take care when car-
rying full buckets of hot water.
 Don’t leave water buckets unattended, especially in homes
with young children or small pets.
Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 77

Gathering Your Ingredients
Pull together all the ingredients you need to mix up your green
cleaning agents. Chances are, you’ve got a good number of them in
your pantry, maybe a couple in the fridge, and one or two under
the bathroom sink or in the laundry room. My guess is you’ll have
to purchase very little to whip up your own formulas. And if you
do, you can find most of the ingredients in your grocery store.
Neutralizing with acids or alkalines
Many of the ingredients on my list are either acid or alkaline, and
each functions as a cleaning agent in a unique way.
No need to panic: Understanding the power of acids and alkalines
doesn’t require an advanced degree in chemistry. The pH scale is
used to measure the nature of certain elements, with 7 being neu-
tral. Certain household cleaning ingredients rate as
 Acid, which measure at 6 or less on the pH scale
 Alkaline, which come in at 8 or higher on the scale
The cleaners in these categories work as a function of the pH level.
Here’s how: Say that you spill some tomato sauce on your table-
cloth. Tomatoes are acidic in nature, so the best cleaner is one 
that neutralizes the acid: an alkaline agent such as salt or baking
soda. On the other hand, if the tablecloth has been washed in an
alkaline-based detergent, it may have some soap buildup that a
more acidic solution, such as a vinegar rinse, can remove.
Because dirt, stains, scum, and buildup are caused by elements
both acidic and alkaline, having cleaners from both camps is a sure
way to cover all your bases.
Acids include
 Lemon juice: This citric acid bleaches, disinfects, deodorizes,
and cuts grease. Use the real thing — or bottled concentrate.
 Hydrogen peroxide: An oxygen bleach that doesn’t have the
same harmful properties as chlorine bleach, this mild acid is
used as an antiseptic for minor wounds and kills germs when
it’s used as a cleaning agent, too.
 White distilled vinegar: Count on this wonder cleaner for
deodorizing, cutting through grease, removing stains, and
freshening.
Part II: Getting to Work 
78

Alkaline ingredients are equally common and include
 Baking soda: Sodium bicarbonate not only neutralizes the
acid in your stomach, it cleans up acidic stains and messes,
works as mild abrasive, shines up aluminum, chrome, silver,
and other metals, and unclogs and cleans drains. It also cuts
grease and dirt, and it deodorizes.
 Washing soda: Also known as sodium carbonate, this stronger
iteration of sodium bi-carbonate (baking soda) looks similar
and is sometimes available in the laundry section of the
supermarket or hardware store.
 Borax: Another member of the sodium family (sodium borate),
this natural mineral is a disinfectant and is sold at drugstores,
supermarkets, and hardware and supply stores.
 Cornstarch: Just as its name implies, this mild and absorbent
cleaner is a starch derived from corn.
 Cornmeal: Set aside some the next time you’re making corn
muffins: This mildly abrasive substance makes easy work of
grease stains.
 Club soda: Have a big bottle of bubbly on hand for cleaning
glass or tackling wine spills on carpet.
 Cream of tartar: This white crystalline powder sold in the
spice section of supermarkets whips up impressive meringue
and makes a great paste for scrubbing cookware.
 Salt: Another member of the sodium family, sodium chloride —
or common table salt — is a natural scrubbing agent.
Lathering up with soaps and oils
Soap comes in many forms: bar, liquid, foam, laundry formulas,
dish liquid, and hand and body bars. But all contain similar ele-
ments, including minerals, which give soap an alkaline nature, and
oils, which promote lather and add emollient (softening) proper-
ties. The time-honored recipe for bar soap has been a concoction
of animal fat and lye — an extremely corrosive alkaline substance
that can cause severe burns. You want to avoid contact with skin,
eyes, and mouth and keep away from children and pets.
I steer clear of lye and animal byproducts in my recipes. The basic
liquid soaps on the ingredients list are plant-based. And my alka-
line list includes products not nearly as harsh as lye. I also use
essential oils in a few of the recipes.
Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 79

 Liquid castile soap: This vegetable-based soap, found in 
grocery or health-food stores, is a mild and versatile 
cleaning agent.
 Essential oils: Tea tree, peppermint, grapefruit, and other oils
(found in health-food or craft stores) not only smell great,
they have disinfecting properties, as well.
 Glycerin: This common ingredient in hand-wash and dish
liquid is an oil that provides lubrication and is often used in
milder cleaners.
 Castor oil: The colorless or sometimes yellowish oil, from the
castor plant, is a fine lubricant and a worthy ingredient in
wood cleaners or polishes.
 Liquid hand soap and liquid dishwashing soap: The same
ingredients — castile soap, glycerin — are found in both of
these mild cleaners.
Add a few other common ingredients to your green cleaning:
 Pumice: A lightweight volcanic rock, an abrasive, works espe-
cially well on stubborn stains in toilet bowls.
 Sunshine: An excellent disinfectant — let the sun shine on
fresh-washed laundry.
Singling out two top workhorses
If I were stranded on a deserted island — with a house that needed
to be cleaned — I’d ask for just two products: white distilled vine-
gar and baking soda. With these two simple ingredients, I could
easily keep my island abode spotlessly clean.
Baking soda and vinegar are the yin and yang of cleaning ingredi-
ents. One alkaline and the other acid, the two team up to create a
formidable cleaning duo. They can stand on their own against
some of the toughest challenges: Baking soda shines metal sur-
faces and fixtures, unclogs drains, removes odors, and tackles
tough, baked-on, food buildup. Vinegar fights stains, scum, mildew,
and germs and can make windows gleam. Both are gentle on most
surfaces and materials — but wait until you see them join forces to
clean a toilet bowl!
Both of these inexpensive ingredients appear again and again in
the recipes in this chapter. But to begin greening your cleaning
immediately, keep a shaker of baking soda and a squirt bottle of
vinegar-water solution at your kitchen sink and turn to them
throughout the day for a variety of needs:
Part II: Getting to Work 
80

 Sprinkle baking soda in an empty sink, give the sink a brief
scrub with water and a damp cloth or sponge, and rinse with
clean water.
 Dust baking soda on your cutting board to draw out odor and
stains — especially if the stains are acid-based. Let it sit for 15
minutes or so and then rinse.
 Set a box of baking soda in your refrigerator to absorb food
odors. Replace every three months. Pour old baking soda
down the sink drain.
 Soak rubber gloves in water with a sprinkle of baking soda.
Then rinse and dry.
 Add a sprinkle of baking soda to freshen the cat litter box.
 Spray vinegar on counter stains (unless countertops are
marble) and let soak a few minutes before wiping off.
 Wipe fingerprints and toothpaste spatter off bathroom mir-
rors with a mist of vinegar — just wipe dry with newspaper.
A mixture of 1⁄2 cup baking soda and 1⁄2 cup cornstarch with 3
drops of essential oil (optional for scent) sprinkled in 
athletic shoes will absorb odors and moisture.
 Pour vinegar in the toilet tank to keep odors away.
As versatile as white distilled vinegar is, it doesn’t belong in some
places: cleaning marble floors, for example, or washing cotton,
linen, rayon, and acetate. Baking soda and other alkaline deter-
gents, on the other hand, should not be used on wool or silk.
Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 81
Let the sunshine in
Sunshine as a cleaning agent? You bet. The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight works
to kill germs. No wonder your grandma hung out her wash on the clothesline. Not
only did the laundry absorb that sweet scent of outdoors, the sunlight worked to
subdue dust mites in the bed sheets and bacteria in your grandpa’s socks. (For more
ways your grandparents got it right, see Chapter 13.)
If you live in a sunny area — and a neighborhood that doesn’t have an ordinance
against clotheslines — take advantage of free solar power and let your laundry line-
dry. Set freshly washed toys, car accessories, doormats, and outdoor furniture to dry
in the sun on an old blanket, quilt, or shower curtain.
Windows filter out much of the ultraviolet rays, but you can still get some assistance
from the sun by opening your curtains and letting the sun shine in.

Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas
You’ve likely bought a spectrum of all-purpose cleaning products
that claim to clean everything from tub and tile work to formica
counters and appliance surfaces. You can make general-use formu-
las with similar powers with a minimum of effort and mess. Several
of the recipes in this section include one or the other of the two
“workhorse” ingredients covered in the previous section: baking
soda and white distilled vinegar. But I introduce a few of the other
agents in your new green-cleaning arsenal here.
In the cleaners to come, those with vinegar and water can last a
long time, but those with lemon or essential oils have a shorter
shelf life. If your recipes contain these last two ingredients, I sug-
gest making only a batch and using it up in a day or two.
Try sampling one new recipe at a time, testing it, and seeing how
you like it. Mixing up cleaning formulas is a lot like experimenting
in the kitchen: Sometimes it takes some tweaks and finessing to get
a recipe just the way you like it.
Also, in some cases, I provide more than one recipe in case you are
out of an ingredient or you have a preference.
Check garden supply centers, hardware stores, and grocery stores
for plastic spray bottles you can use for your recipes. Quart-size
bottles are the most convenient for big jobs like windows, counters,
and showers. Label them so that you know what is in each bottle.
Do-it-all cleaners
These all-purpose cleaners should do everything you need. More
abrasive cleaners are available commercially; some are quite gritty.
Generally, the larger and harder the particles, the more abrasive.
Part II: Getting to Work 
82
Mild All-Purpose Cleaner
This baking soda–based formula gently scours away dirt, food spills, stains,
and buildup on most surfaces. Its deodorizing properties make it an ideal
solution for cleaning refrigerators, microwaves, diaper pails, tiles, coffee
pots — even baby’s and children’s toys.
Yield: 1 quart

1 Mix all ingredients in a cleaning pail or quart bottle.
2 Wipe surfaces with a soft cloth or sponge.
Vary It! Vinegar is a great degreaser and works especially well to remove
soap scum in tubs and showers. Mix 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup white vinegar and 1 quart of
water in a spray bottle. Spray on surface, wait 30 seconds, and wipe away.
Rinse off with hot water if you’re cleaning soap scum in tubs, showers, or
sinks.
Vary It! The soap or detergent in this variation gives it an extra boost and
makes a great solution for getting the grime off mailboxes, outdoor furniture,
and concrete patio floors. Place 2 tablespoons of liquid hand soap or dish-
washing detergent in a bottle, fill with 1 quart warm water, and shake. (You
can even add a squeeze of lemon for scent, if you’d like — just strain the
lemon to remove seeds and pulp.) Use a soft cloth or sponge to wipe up coun-
tertops, floors, painted interior doors, and walls. For exteriors, use a scrub
brush and elbow grease.
Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 83
4 tablespoons baking soda
1 quart water
Minty Fresh All-Purpose 
Cleaner
If you like the smell of mint, try this cleaner, which comes from my nephew
and his wife who are organic farmers in New Hampshire. It works on sinks,
showers, tile floors — and as a great insect-deterrent when sprayed on out-
door plants and flowers.
Yield: 1 quart
2 tablespoons peppermint liquid castile
soap
1⁄4 cup baking soda
1⁄4 cup white vinegar
Water to fill quart spray bottle
1 Mix all ingredients in the bottle. Spray on cloth, mop, or directly on 
surface.
Note: A leading brand name in scented castile soap, Dr. Bronner’s comes in
several size containers, often available at health-food stores. Some sell it in
bulk — bring your refillable jug with you.

Glass cleaners
Newspapers do a great job of shining up glass — and they’re a
great green solution: Reuse before recycling! But if you object to
getting the newsprint all over your hands, paper towel is another
option. Just be sure to buy a brand that’s soft on nature. (See
Chapter 5 for details on recycled paper products.) Do outside win-
dows on an overcast day, as strong sun dries the glass before you
can buff the windows clean.
Part II: Getting to Work 
84
Tile and Vinyl Floor Cleaner
Both vinyl and tile are tough floorings that clean up beautifully with this
simple formula.
Yield: 1 gallon
1⁄8 cup liquid castile soap
1⁄8 cup white vinegar
1 gallon water
1 Mix all ingredients in bucket.
2 Damp mop.
Note: If you don’t have castile soap, add another 1⁄8 cup vinegar.
Linoleum Floor Cleaner
Made from natural products, including linseed oil and cork flour, linoleum
is making a comeback because of its green qualities. Care can be more of
a challenge, however, as excess water and harsh chemicals can cause
damage. For the necessary wipe-down or spot cleaning, this recipe is a
safe remedy.
Yield: 1 quart
1⁄4 cup white vinegar
1 1⁄2 to 2 cups water
1 Mix all ingredients in a quart spray bottle.
2 Spray soft mop until just damp, and mop.

Don’t use cotton cloth because it leaves lint behind. A microfiber
cloth made for glass and windows works fine.
Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 85
Window, Glass, and 
Mirror Cleaner
This classic formula is my No. 1 favorite for windows. A squirt bottle and
a stack of newspapers can wipe away a season’s worth of grime and fool
resident birds into thinking that the windows are open.
Yield: 1 quart plus 1 cup (approximately)
1⁄2 cup to 1 cup white vinegar
1 quart cool water
1 Combine all ingredients in spray bottle.
2 Spritz solution on surface. Rub until dry (to avoid spotting) with news-
paper or white paper towel.
Note: For a quick no-mix cleaner, which works best on indoor windows and
mirrors, put club soda on a microfiber cloth or paper towel and apply to 
surface.
Vary It! Try this heavy-duty cleaner to cut through grime: Combine 1⁄2 cup to
1 cup white vinegar, 1 tablespoon liquid dish soap or detergent, and 1 quart
water in a spray bottle. Spray window and, with newspaper, rub until dry (to
avoid spotting).
Vary It! To clean glass vases, fill them 3⁄4 full with room-temperature water
and add 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Cover and shake. Rinse with clear water
and air-dry.
Polishing Wood Furniture, Floors,
and Collectibles
Water isn’t a friend to wood, so the best way to clean it is to dry-
dust. Use a lintfree rag or microfiber cloth — which traps dust,
lint, and pet dander — for furniture and collectibles. Dry-mop or
vacuum floors to pick up dust and food particles. Steer clear of
feather dusters: They simply stir up dust rather than eliminate it,
and their quills can scratch wood surfaces.

You may want to polish furnishings once or twice a year. Don’t
polish wood floors, however, unless you want to turn your living
room into a slip’n’slide attraction. Even your pets will find it diffi-
cult to get traction.
When furnishings and floors have collected a little more grime than
floating dust or lint, you’re probably inclined to ratchet up your
efforts. In that case, I offer some solutions that involve the sparing
use of water.
Part II: Getting to Work 
86
Dust Buster for Collectibles
White distilled vinegar is a terrific solution for collectibles and fragile
items.
Yield: 3 cups
2 cups water
1 cup white vinegar
2 drops of lemon oil (optional for scent)
1 Mix all ingredients in a bowl or spray bottle.
2 Dampen cloth with solution. Wipe down collectibles.
Warning: Be cautious when damp-dusting delicate items, antiques, and fur-
nishings that have old paint, gilding, or gold leaf. Avoid leaving any water
on these pieces and take care not to rub too vigorously. It’s best to leave
valuable items to the care of professionals in antique care.
Hardwood Floor Cleaner
Vacuum or dry-mop floors first to remove crumbs, chunks of dirt, and
dust. Then follow with this cleaner.
Yield: 3 cups
3 cups white vinegar
1 tablespoon castile soap
3 drops grapefruit essential oil
3 cups water
1 Mix all ingredients in a bucket of water.
2 Barely wet the rag or mop with the solution. Run over floors and let 
air-dry.

Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 87
Wood Furniture Polish
Traditional furniture polishes contain beeswax and linseed or lemon oil. You
can actually take a chunk of beeswax and rub it into your wood furnishings,
buffing in with a soft cloth. This recipe is another easy homemade favorite.
1 Mix all ingredients in an open container.
2 Dab cloth with mixture. Rub oil into furniture, using sparingly. Buff into
wood.
Tip: Linseed oil seems to be absorbed more easily than olive oil, which
requires a bit more elbow grease to buff in. Both oils are expensive to use in
large quantities. This is definitely not a good use for expensive extra-virgin
olive oil!
Vary It! To convert this formula into a polish that does double-duty as a
cleaner, add 1⁄4 cup white distilled vinegar and put in a spray bottle. If used for
a picture frame, protect the picture by using a cloth rather than spray.
Rolling Out the Carpet Cleaners
The great advantage of area rugs and throws is that you can pick
them up and shake them out, lay them in the sun, and even toss
them in the washer, if they’re not too large and labeled “washable.”
Wall-to-wall carpeting, however, not only takes plenty of abuse, but
must be cleaned in its place. And unlike hard-surface floors that
you can dust and mop, the only way to pick up loose dirt, dander,
dust, and other allergens it collects is to vacuum. A good vacuum
is a must for maintaining your carpeting (see Chapter 5), but effec-
tive cleaners for spots and shampooing are also important.
Don’t wait for spills to settle in: Take action immediately by pick-
ing up the debris and follow with a dab of water blotted into the
spot gently. Plain water is always the first course of action — cold
water is the best solution for bloodstains and most food stains.
Yield: 1 pint
1 pint linseed or olive oil (or a smaller
amount if you prefer)
4 or 5 drops of lemon essential oil
(optional for scent)

Choose a white absorbent cloth or white paper towel to dab out the
spot: Printed or dyed materials can leave a stain, especially on white
or light-colored carpet. Don’t use too much water; you don’t want
the carpet to be damp for long or water to seep down into the pad.
For wall-to-wall carpet with multiple stains, the best solution is to
call in carpet-cleaning professionals. (Chapter 11 covers carpet
cleaning in more detail.)
Part II: Getting to Work 
88
Carpet Spot Remover
This solution works well for a number of stains, including chocolate and
blood (if cold water alone doesn’t work).
Yield: 1 cup
1⁄4 teaspoon of clear, plant-based
dishwashing liquid
1 cup warm water
1 Mix dishwashing liquid and water.
2 Dab mixture on spill. Blot to dry.
Tip: Never use laundry detergent. It may contain bleach and be too harsh.
Vary It! For a strong-staining substance, such as pet urine, mix 1 cup white
vinegar and 1 cup warm water. Dab mixture on spill and blot to dry.
Keeping Food Surfaces Clean
Because of spoilage and contamination issues surrounding food,
surfaces and appliances in the kitchen pose unique challenges to
the green housekeeper. In commercial kitchens — restaurants,
institutional cafeterias, and hotels — state health laws require
strict standards of upkeep, which include using hot water and
strong disinfectants to clean, eliminating the risk of food-borne ill-
nesses. Chlorine bleach is the disinfectant often dictated, but a
milder choice is hydrogen peroxide. Solutions made up of hydro-
gen peroxide and water or borax and water or vinegar and water
have disinfecting properties.

Green commercial cleaners can effectively disinfect surfaces as
well. These cleaners are suitable for the home environment, and
many smell good, too. Look for the following characteristics:
 Detergents are plant, not petroleum, based
 Never tested on animals, sometimes listed as cruelty-free
 Doesn’t create harmful fumes or leave harmful residues
behind
This book is about home cleaning rather than commercial clean-
ing, but the same health risks exist in the home as in the restau-
rant. The experts I’ve talked to — including folks who work in food
laboratories — insist that eco-friendly disinfectants, such as vine-
gar and lemon juice, don’t stand up to bleach, which they use to
clean between testing. So if you’re determined to keep bleach out
of your home, you need to be even more diligent about food con-
tamination in your kitchen, which has as much to do with tech-
niques of food handling as it does with cleaning products.
For more information about disinfecting and avoiding cross con-
tamination in the kitchen, read Chapter 7. Meanwhile, you can feel
comfortable using the all-purpose cleaners covered in the previous
section. (Both baking soda and vinegar are perfect partners for the
kitchen.) In the following sections, I offer several kitchen cleaners
free of any ingredients a green purist would object to.
Oven and stovetop cleaners
Check the oven manufacturer’s instructions before cleaning the
oven. If you lost them, go online for the answer or call the place
you bought the oven from. Many manufacturers are adding green
suggestions to their instruction booklets.
Here are a few tips to get you started:
 Cornstarch is great for absorbing grease and oily spills.
Lightly sprinkle cornstarch on your stovetop and allow it to
soak up the grease. Wipe away with damp sponge.
 After a messy spillover — whether blueberry pie or lasagna —
wait until the oven is cool before attempting to clean. Then
sprinkle baking soda on spilled food or spray inside of oven
with water until damp. Allow to sit for several minutes or even
overnight. Remove with cleaning cloth or paper towel.
Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 89

If you’re out of baking soda or want a little more “scrub”
action, salt is a good choice. Simply sprinkle table salt on the
spill while the oven is still warm. Wait for the salt and stain to
cool and then scrape food away. Wipe with damp cloth.
 To clean your microwave oven, mix 1⁄4 cup baking soda and 1⁄2
cup water and apply with damp sponge. Let the paste set for
several minutes and then wipe away with clean sponge.
Cleaners for cookware
As soon as your cookware has cooled after using, put it in the sink
to soak in water, adding a squirt of dishwashing liquid or a sprinkle
of baking soda. This method lifts off the burned-on food and makes
cleanup easier. After soaking your cookware, scrub it with a
sponge and finish with hot soapy water or put it in the dishwasher,
if appropriate.
Don’t make the mistake of putting dishwashing liquid into the dish-
washer. You’ll end up with tons of suds spilling out all over the floor.
Dishwashing tips are thoroughly covered in Chapter 7.
Commercially available green dishwashing liquids are effective,
but, alas, green options for automatic dish detergents aren’t as
plentiful. In commercially available products, avoid phosphates,
chlorine, and ammonia and look for labels that say biodegradable.
The following combinations are for pots and pans that may have
years of buildup and won’t come clean with a general washing:
 Stainless Steel Rejuvenator: Pour water in a pot until halfway
to almost full. Add 1⁄2 cup of white vinegar and bring to a boil.
Immediately reduce heat and simmer 1⁄2 to 1 hour. Empty and
wash as usual.
 Aluminum Illuminator: You can shine up your aluminum
cookware and rub new life into pots and pans. Add water until
the pot is half to three-fourths full. Add 2 tablespoons cream
of tartar or 1⁄2 cup of white vinegar to water. Bring to boil. Then
reduce heat and simmer 10 to 15 minutes. Empty and wash as
usual.
 Burned-On Grease Cleaner: Baking soda works well at 
removing built-up grease from any kind of cookware. After the
pan cools, scrape out surface grease. Fill pan with water and
sprinkle in baking soda. Place pan on stovetop and bring to
boil. When grease floats to the top of the water, remove from
heat. Let cool. Wash as usual.

Cleaning metals and silverware
You can wipe the stickiness right off refrigerator door handles,
faucets, fixtures, cabinet pulls, and more by mixing 1⁄4 cup white
vinegar and 1⁄2 cup water. Using a clean cloth, wipe the surfaces
with the mixture.
For sinks and silverware, consult the manufacturers’ recommenda-
tions. Stainless steel flatware can go right in the dishwasher.
If you use your silverware on a daily basis, good for you! Simply
wash in the sink with mild soap and hot water, dry, and put away. If
you pull out the good stuff only rarely, storing it properly can help
cut down on tarnish. Nevertheless, you may need to polish once or
twice a year. Apply a low-abrasion white toothpaste (not gel) to a
soft toothbrush and gently brush the silverware. Rinse with warm
water and dry thoroughly with a towel or silver-polishing cloth.
If you prefer to keep your toothpaste in the medicine cabinet,
here’s another traditional favorite that works equally well. Combine
1 cup water with 2 tablespoons baking soda in a measuring cup.
Apply mixture to silver with a soft cloth, rubbing until dry.

Stainless-Steel Sink Cleaner
This concoction is more watery than pasty.
Yield: 1  1⁄2 cups
3 tablespoons baking soda
1 drop of essential oil (for scent,
optional)
1 1⁄2 cups water
Water rinse
1 Mix baking soda and water together.
2 Add oil for scent if you like.
3 Rinse with clear water.
4 Dry with a cloth.

Tackling Water-Challenged Areas
No area of the house gets wetter than the bathroom. And along
with all that water comes the accompanying problems of mold,
mildew, mineral buildup, lime and scale, soap scum, and clogs. The
traditional solutions to these challenges have relied on some
pretty strong chemicals: Caustic lye and chlorine bleach are two of
the most familiar agents to plumbing fixtures, porcelain, and tile.
The fact is, these tough chemicals do attack the problems fero-
ciously — you can see the scum just fizz away! But if you’re com-
mitted to retiring these toxic elements, I offer other ways to
combat those troublesome water-loving blights. Plenty of cleaners
that claim to be green are on the market, but sometimes it’s hard
to read between the lines to determine whether they are really free
of the petrochemicals and elements toxic to the residents of your
home and damaging to the Earth. (Read Chapter 3 for more about
choosing safe cleaners. Also, the Appendix of this book lists rec-
ommended green cleaners.)
Use the mild and medium all-purpose cleaners already covered in
“Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas” for countertops, tubs, and tile
floors. Baking soda with a small amount of water makes a mild
abrasive paste that you can apply with a sponge or soft cloth to
sinks and faucets.
Battling mold, mildew, 
and other buildup
Chlorine bleach has been the conventional cleaner of choice for
mold and mildew. Eliminating mold and mildew is crucial because
they can lead to serious health issues.
Part II: Getting to Work 
92

A preemptive effort is to keep the bathroom and other areas of the
house as dry as possible. Make sure that the air in your home is
circulating effectively. Use the bathroom fan during and after show-
ering. You may even consider using a dehumidifier to remove
excess dampness.
To keep mold and mildew at bay, mix 1⁄4 cup hydrogen peroxide 
and 1 cup water in a spray bottle. Spray on problem areas. Do not
rinse off.
Removing soap scum, water stains,
and lime and mineral deposits
The mild all-purpose cleaner mentioned earlier in this chapter in
the “Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas” section is great for eliminat-
ing soap scum and water stains. For a bit more punch, increase the
vinegar to a 1-to-1 ratio. It works on tile, porcelain, and metal fix-
tures and drain covers.
For lime and mineral deposits, use vinegar straight-up, wiping on
with a rag. For extra-stubborn spots, leave the rag on for several
minutes or one hour. Then wipe dry.
Flushing away dirt and germs
The toilet area is another hot spot for bacteria. In addition to store-
bought green cleaners, vinegar and baking soda are two tough
agents. Use any of the all-purpose cleaners appearing in the
“Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas” section in this chapter. You may
want to use paper towel to clean the outside of the toilet — or be
sure the sponges and cloths you use for the toilet aren’t used for
anything else. One technique is to put the disinfectant in the toilet
and let it stand while you clean the rest of the bathroom. Then
swish with the toilet brush and flush.

Toilet Bowl Cleaner
This recipe is one of my favorite toilet bowl cleaners. I like to watch the
mini-explosion when the alkaline baking soda and acidic vinegar meet up.
Yield: 1 or 2 quarts approximately
1 tablespoon dishwashing liquid soap
1 tablespoon white vinegar
Hot water
1 Mix the solution in a bucket or perhaps in the toilet brush holder, which
has been emptied first.
2 Place the toilet brush in the solution and swish until clean. Follow with a
rinse in clean water.
3 Shake to dry and return to the holder or stand.
1 Sprinkle sides with baking soda and allow to stand for a few minutes.
2 Pour in vinegar and let stand for 15 minutes.
3 Scrub with toilet brush and flush.
Tip: In a hurry? Pour 1⁄2 cup of white vinegar in and swish around, let sit, and
flush. You can also pour some vinegar into the tank and let it stand a while
before flushing. Or you use a pumice stone to scrub out stains. (Reduce the
“yuck” factor by attaching a pumice stone to a stick or buy one put together
already from a hardware or home-supply store.) Simply sprinkle the sides of
the toilet with baking soda and allow it to set a few minutes, swish with a
toilet brush, and flush. (Pumice is tough on stains, but it is abrasive on sur-
faces, so make sure that you don’t scratch the inside of the bowl.) Follow by
rubbing the inside of bowl, especially around rim, with pumice stone. Swish
again and flush.
Toilet Brush Cleaner
Clean the toilet brush regularly, at least once a month. Replace when
needed — you’ll know it’s time for a new one when it becomes permanently
rust-colored or gray.
Yield: 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup
Baking Soda
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup of white vinegar

Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 95
Cleaning and Unclogging Drains
One of the easiest ways to keep your drain clean is to pour 1⁄2 to 1
cup baking soda down the drain. Follow with dripping warm water.
Perform once every week or two. Be sure to let it stand a few min-
utes before rinsing — if you flush it out too quickly, the baking
soda won’t have much effect.
To combat rusty drains and dirty garbage disposals, rub the cut
side of a halved lemon half on rust around drain and on faucets.
Rinse with water. Then put the used lemons in the disposal and
grind for freshening — or throw in your compost bucket.
If a clogged showerhead is an issue, remove the showerhead and
clear holes with an old toothbrush or unbent paperclip. Rinse with
clear water. Then place the showerhead in a bowl or bucket of
vinegar. Soak overnight to remove deposits. Rinse with clear water,
dry, and put back in place.
Drain Cleaner
For trouble-free maintenance, mix up a batch of this cleaner and use once
a week.
Yield: 2 1⁄4 cups
1 cup salt
1 cup baking soda
1⁄4 cup cream of tartar
1 Mix ingredients and keep in a well-marked container.
2 Pour 1⁄4 cup of this mixture into the drain. Rinse with water. Repeat as
necessary or save the rest of the batch for the future.
Vary It! Washing soda is a bit more powerful than baking soda or the other
alkalines in this variation. But if you keep it in the house for laundry use,
mix 1⁄2 cup of washing soda with 1 gallon of warm water. Set aside. Pour hot
water down the drain. Slowly pour washing-soda solution down the drain.
Rinse with more hot water.

A Laundry List of Solutions
Keeping your clothes clean is an ongoing cycle of maintenance that
demands its share of resources: The washer and dryer, as a pair,
consume more energy than any other household appliance besides
the refrigerator. And, of course, a lot of water is sacrificed to keep
your wardrobe smelling sweet.
In addition to taking steps to reduce your energy and water con-
sumption (see Chapter 9), your choice of detergents, soaps, soften-
ers, and spot removers can help you improve your personal
environmental report card in the laundry room.
See spot run
Removing stains is a bit tricky, because some fibers are weakened
by certain chemicals. Strong alkaline substances, such as washing
soda, for example, can ruin delicate wool and silk, but small amounts
of washing soda can be good for removing oil and grease stains on
sturdier fabrics. Always check the label on your garments to deter-
mine their fiber content and washing instructions.
Water is your first solution for most fabrics. So as soon as you drop
food or drink or whatever, try to wipe it off with clean water. Here
are a few solutions when you need a little more power.
Drain Declogger
If this recipe doesn’t work, try a plunger or call the plumber.
Yield: 1 gallon plus two cups approximately
1⁄2 to 1 cup of baking soda
1⁄2 to 1 cup of white vinegar
1 gallon boiling water
1 Pour the baking soda down the drain. Follow with vinegar, pouring slowly.
2 Listen for a fizzing sound. Cover the drain and let stand for 5 minutes.
3 Pour boiling water into drain.

Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 97
1 Mix ingredients to create paste. Dab mixture on stains. Follow with
normal washing.
White Clothing Stain Remover
This prewash treatment isn’t appropriate for silk, but it’s great for handling
stains on most other whites.
Old Linen Stain Remover
For truly antique linens, such as framed samplers or quilts, consult
experts. But this gentle formula works for dish towels, tablecloths, and
other linens.
1 Mix water and soap in a bucket or in the laundry or kitchen sink.
2 Place linens in the solution. Soak for an hour or so.
3 Follow with a light swishing by hand, rinse with plain water, and 
line dry.
Yield: 7 tablespoons
1 tablespoon borax
6 tablespoons water
Yield: 1 quart
2 squirts dishwashing liquid
1 quart water

Freshening clothes
If a garment doesn’t require a washing but needs an airing-out,
hanging it out in the sun is a much gentler remedy than spraying it
with a clothing freshener — which is in essence a perfume masking
the musty odor of the clothing.
If fading is a concern, turn the garment inside-out. This tactic also
serves to expose the underarm area, which is likely where most of
the freshening is needed.
Laundering
As you prepare to launder, always remember to read garment and
linen labels and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using
a washing machine.
 Use the proper load setting for the size of each load.
 Match the temperature setting to the type of cleaning desired.
 When using detergent, measure properly. If you use too much,
the load won’t rinse properly.
I’ll be straight with you: When it comes to the laundry, my prefer-
ence is to use an Earth-friendly commercial cleaner rather than go to
the trouble of mixing my own. But for diehard do-it-yourselfers, here
are some beginning recipes for cleaning everyday home laundry.

Presoak and Fabric Softener
A favorite and easy fabric softener is to add 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup white vinegar to the
rinse cycle in an automatic washing machine. But if you don’t want to be a
wash-watcher, try this presoak, which also removes stains.
Yield: 1 gallon
2 tablespoons cream of tartar
1 gallon hot water
1 Mix the solution in a bucket and then let cool. Let the fabrics sit in the
mixture for a half-hour or until the stain is released.
2 Rinse with fresh water. Afterward, launder as normal.

Chapter 6: Mixing Things Up: A Green Cleaner Cookbook 99
1 cup soap flakes or shredded
homemade soap, or any store-bought
type without lotion
1⁄2 cup washing soda
1⁄2 cup borax
A few drops of essential oil (optional for
scent)
Dry Laundry Detergent
Yield: 2 cups
Mix all ingredients and store in an airtight container. Use 1⁄4 cup to 1 cup
detergent, depending on the size of the load and the machine type.
Vary It! For soft water, reduce washing soda to 1⁄4 cup. For hard water,
increase washing soda and borax to 1 cup.
Liquid Laundry Detergent
Yield: 4 cups
1 cup soap flakes (homemade soap, or
any store-bought type without lotion)
1⁄2 cup washing soda
1⁄2 cup borax
2 tablespoons glycerin
2 cups water
1 Mix soap, washing soda, and borax. Add glycerin and water, stirring
until thoroughly combined.
2 Use  1⁄4 to 3⁄4 cup per load in cold or warm water.
Note: Mixture may congeal and will need to be re-mixed before use. The
amount of detergent needed varies depending on load size.

Cleaning Up the Odds and Ends
Beyond the typical household cleaning tasks that involve floors,
furniture, fixtures, and more are some unique surfaces or materials
that need to be cleaned, too. Here are some ways to address those
items:
 For a gentle paint remover for your hands, use vegetable oil
instead of paint thinner.
 You can use this gentle cleaner for your garage floor or patio
or kitchen floor: Mix 1⁄4 cup mild dishwashing liquid with 2 
gallons warm water and apply. Rinse with clean water and 
air dry.
 When cleaning your vehicle’s exterior, do not use anything
abrasive on the finish — that means no grit, such as baking
soda, or anything acidic like vinegar. Try mixing several
squirts or 1⁄4 cup of mild liquid dishwashing detergent with 1
gallon of water in a bucket. Get some suds going, throw in the
sponge, and clean away! Rinse with clean water, use a
squeegee, and buff the car dry with a clean cloth.

Air Freshener
The best way to get your house to smell good is to rid it of sources of bad
odor. But when that’s not possible, here’s a spray with disinfecting ingredi-
ents that also seems to suppress unpleasant odors.
Yield: 2 scant cups
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vinegar or lemon juice
2 cups water
1 Mix all ingredients in a spray bottle with a fine spray.
2 Mist the air gently, particularly near the source of odors.
Vary It! Try this realtor trick to freshen up your house. Add 3 or 4 cinnamon
sticks to 4 cups boiling water. Simmer for an hour or so. (Don’t let all the water
evaporate out of the pan.)

n the 21st-century home, the kitchen serves as the heart — a
heart that’s getting bigger. According the U.S. Census Bureau,
from 1950 to 2004, the average size of the kitchen increased 216
percent, while the home itself increased by only 72 percent in size.
Not a very green trend, to be sure — more space means more
resources and energy. Thus, it becomes all the more important to
the ecoconscious housekeeper that the kitchen be a clean, green
environment. Just as preparing heart-healthy foods is an important
value, so is keeping the heart of the home equally healthy.
Your green-living philosophy can smoothly align with the tenets of
a germ-free kitchen. Eliminating toxic components such as off-
gassing furnishings and chemicals is a health-smart move. Some
sources challenge the ability to keep bacteria at bay without using
materials that are considered toxic. In this chapter, I walk you
through the best tips for cleaning, maintaining, and operating your
kitchen in a way that’s green and safe.
Kinder, Gentler Germ Warfare
The presence of food heightens risks of germs and food-borne ill-
nesses. For all its life-giving, nourishing aspects, food is messy. It
splatters on cabinets, burns onto cooking surfaces, seeps into
refrigerator spaces, hides under cabinets and appliances, attracts
insects and other vermin, and breeds bacteria.

Although concerns about bacteria in the kitchen are legitimate,
those who adhere to green principles want to avoid the traditional
disinfectants: bleach and ammonia. State health laws almost
always dictate that commercial and industrial kitchens use some
form of bleach sanitizer. Yet many home health advocates have
concerns about the harm it can do to the environment and to indi-
viduals. (For more about bleach and other toxic cleaning agents,
read Chapter 3.)
In this chapter, I offer alternatives to bleaches and harsh cleaners. I
warn you, however, that sometimes my green-clean methods do
require more energy consumption — your energy, that is. Be pre-
pared to expend some sweat equity in some cases.
Washing Your Hands of It
When I come home from work, shopping, or elsewhere in the “out-
side world,” the first thing I do is wash my hands at the kitchen
sink with soap and water and dry them. I’m diligent about remov-
ing the crud I’ve picked up from packages, store counters, stair
rails, and doorknobs. Washing my hands keeps whatever I’ve
picked up from invading my home environment.
Effectively ridding your hands of the bacteria collected from the
world’s dirty surfaces requires a full 20 seconds of rinsing and soap-
ing under warm water. Your grade-school-aged acquaintances
advise the singing of “Happy Birthday” as a good time gauge. I
strongly suggest washing your hands whenever you enter your
home, whether you’ve been out in the yard, digging in your garden,
or having lunch at a coffee shop — and any time before working in
the kitchen with food, dishes, and surfaces where food might touch.
Don’t stop at simply washing your hands, however. Before digging
into a turkey cavity or cookie batter, grab a clean hand towel and
dry your hands well. Drying’s just as important to reduce the risk
of spreading bacteria. Wet hands can transfer pathogens much
more easily than dry hands.
And what about antibacterial soap? Necessary? Most studies indi-
cate that antibacterial products are little better at killing germs
than plain soap and water. Some evidence even suggests that anti-
bacterial products may actually lead to antibiotic resistance. Of
further concern are some of the components of antibacterials —
triclosan and phthalates — that may lead to pollution through waste
water. In fact, the World Health Organization has launched a cam-
paign against the misuse and misinformation about such cleaners.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
104

Easily, the greenest response is to dispense with the super-powered
soaps — and just be sure you wash well with simple soap and
water.
Handling Food Properly
Storing, preparing, and serving food involves more than merely
keeping a tidy kitchen: Ensuring that perishable items are stored
properly, food surfaces are kept scrupulously clean, and methods
of meal preparation eliminate possible cross-contamination is
absolutely critical for your safety.
Raw meat and produce can leave behind bacteria such as E. coli
and salmonella in preparation areas, on knives, and on towels
reused for wiping up after spills. You can get very sick or die.
Children and the elderly are especially at risk. Meat, poultry, and
eggs have long been considered the biggest threat, but contamina-
tion can come from many sources — even packaged spinach. Not
all food-borne illnesses can be prevented by clean food-handling
practices — but these practices sure cut way down on these risks.
Adherence takes strict attention and can sometimes seem a chal-
lenge to your environmental principles. After all, many of these
steps involve liberal amounts of hot water, or you may be advised
to use disposable wipes or towels to avoid contamination. The safe
choice may be to throw out food if its freshness is in question. And
your concern about disease and disinfecting may pressure you to
use chemicals that are decidedly unhealthy for the planet.
Fighting food contamination 
without chemicals
For the most part, you can keep a clean and safe kitchen and still
adhere to your environmental principles. Here are general guide-
lines for protecting your food from contamination:
 Keep your refrigerator at the proper settings (36 to 39°F) to
ensure that food is cool enough not to spoil.
 Adhere to the expiration dates on all perishables, especially
meat.
 Keep refrigerated food well-wrapped.
 Keep meat products separate from fruits and vegetables.
 Place meat on the lowest shelf to reduce risk of juices 
dripping on other food items.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 105

 Wash any produce that is to be eaten raw — even if you plan
to peel it.
 Don’t prepare vegetables, fruits, or other foods on the same
surface or with the same knife used for poultry, beef, pork, or
fish, until the surface or knife has been scrubbed clean with
soap and hot water.
 Use separate cutting boards: one for meat; another for fruits
and vegetables; and perhaps even another for bread or other
food items. (For more on keeping your cutting boards sani-
tized, see the next section.)
 Don’t reuse the same cloth towel to wipe up spills from food,
especially animal products, including eggs. In some cases, you
may feel justified in using paper towel to avoid contamination.
 Don’t reuse plastic bags or packaging that has held poultry or
other animal products. Wash thoroughly and let dry before
recycling.
Keeping cutting boards germ-free
Most food and meal preparation takes place on a cutting board,
whether a built-in on your countertop, a pullout board, an over-the-
sink model, or a stand-alone board, available in a variety of sizes and
materials. In addition to using separate cutting boards for meats and
produce, you also need to wash the boards with dishwashing liquid
and hot water every time you use them and dry them thoroughly
before putting away. (This method is the best way to clean wood
cutting boards, which don’t hold up in the dishwasher and don’t
take to harsh cleaners — even vinegar can be too acidic.) I don’t use
wood cutting boards: If it doesn’t go in the dishwasher, it doesn’t go
in my house, or it’s relegated to ornamental purposes or special
occasions.
Dishwashers have hotter water than your hands can stand, so you
can trust that your plastic cutting boards are thoroughly sanitized
after a wash. If you plan to clean them in this way, be sure that the
cutting boards are dishwasher safe: Most acrylic or plastic 
boards are.
Bamboo is another cutting board alternative. This rapidly renewable,
Earth-friendly material is extremely hard and durable and has some
antibacterial properties. Bamboo boards are typically formaldehyde-
and toxic-finish-free, but check to make sure. (Now if they could only
grow bamboo closer to home so that we could skip all that embodied
energy from shipping from Asia!) Clean bamboo cutting boards as
you do wooden boards: dish soap and hot water.

Warding off germs from 
your cleaning supplies
Depending upon how you maintain and care for them, your clean-
ing implements can serve as your staunch allies for clean — or
traitorous enemies. Sponges, dish cloths, mops, and scrubbers
tend to be damp mediums that serve as breeding grounds for all
kinds of gruesome germ-life. For more on keeping these items free
of bacteria, see Chapter 5.
Designing for a Cleaner Kitchen
In the case of keeping your kitchen clean, function can follow form.
Design matters when it affects how you clean and how long it
takes. Nothing impresses more than a gourmet kitchen with a stun-
ning island, but a bad layout can make for harder cleaning. If your
kitchen layout requires a lot of foot traffic (walking over to the
fridge, then crossing over to the cutting board, and then rounding
a counter to get to the sink), you increase the amount of spills and
spread the dirt.
Unless you’re considering a major kitchen remodel, you may not
have a lot of flexibility in changing your kitchen layout. However, you
may be able to make adjustments that ease your food prep and clean-
ing and make your kitchen a more enjoyable place to spend time.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 107
Giving veggies a good cleaning
If you buy organic produce, you don’t have to worry about pesticides penetrating
your apples and green peppers from seed to peel. But sprays, dirt, insect residue,
and other contamination coat most of the fruits and vegetables you buy, whether
from a farmers’ market or the neighborhood grocery.
Use a nontoxic vegetable rinse, even on delicate edibles such as broccoli, lettuce,
mushrooms, grapes, and berries. A tablespoon in a couple quarts of water washes
up to 10 pounds of produce. Liquid food rinses contain plant-based cleaning agents.
All it takes is a gentle soak and swish for 30 seconds. Use a vegetable brush on
scruffier items such as carrots and spuds, then prepare, serve, and eat without
worry.

Work triangle: Everything 
within easy reach
The sink and surrounding area is considered the cleanup zone.
Here is where most of the dirty work occurs: dishes pile up after
meals; cooking implements gather on the counters; and food items
from raw poultry to fresh fish get rinsed and set aside for prepara-
tion. The dishwasher, too, is within easy reach of the sink area.
The refrigerator is the second busiest spot in kitchen. Ideal place-
ment of the fridge is as close to food-prep areas and the cleanup
zone as possible to ease the transfer of food and reduce the possi-
bility of spills. After you add in the cooking zone, with range, oven,
and perhaps microwave and toaster oven, your three critical
kitchen zones create the work triangle (see Figure 7-1). Of course,
the tighter and more equilateral your triangle, the more efficient
and easier it is to keep this high-action area clean. Add your plate
rack or cabinet within arm’s reach of the cleanup zone, and you’ve
got the perfect equation for an ideal kitchen layout.
Figure 7-1: A work triangle.
With the popularity of islands — big blocks of workspace set in the
middle of the kitchen — the efficiency of the work triangle is dimin-
ished in many modern kitchens. Also, although kitchens are trend-
ing larger, kitchen convenience is a case in which bigger isn’t
necessarily better. And because larger spaces require more materi-
als, resources, and energy to construct, “small” earns green points.

The easiest way to reduce clutter is to get rid of objects you rarely
use or at least deep-storage them and bring them out only when
you need them.
Save for the occasional nostalgic relic, don’t let the kitchen become
a clutter of rarely used appliances, knick-knacks, backpacks, school
projects, mail, and other stuff. Take advantage of a host of ways —
think appliance garages, lazy Susans, roll-out trays, and more — to
store and hide clutter away from your kitchen counters.
Waste-ing away
Keeping trash and garbage out of sight and out of scent is a chal-
lenge in the kitchen. A trash can under the sink or in the pantry
always seems to reach overflow too quickly to keep up with.
The green kitchen, however, offers some distinct advantages for
managing refuse — primarily, because a sustainably minded house-
keeper throws away less and reduces, reuses, and recycles more.
Here are some ways that you can use green practices to help
reduce the amount of waste you produce in the kitchen:
 Eliminate or reduce the amount of packaging in the products
you buy.
 Cut out heavy use of paper towel and substitute reusable
cloths for cleanup.
 Compost your kitchen scraps. (See the sidebar “Compost and
collected.”)
 Substitute glass storage containers for tossable plastic food
storage bags.
 Use your own canvas or plastic shopping bags and refuse the
plastic and paper shopping bags at the grocery.
 Recycle all the plastic, glass, aluminum, and paper products
accepted by your curbside or local drop-off service. (Chapter
4 explains how to set up a recycling center in your home.)
Following these practices significantly reduces the amount of trash
you produce. You may discover that your weekly garbage produc-
tion is cut back to a single bag — or less.
Whether you replace your big trash receptacle with a smaller one
or simply take out the trash less frequently, opt for a touch-free
can — you step on a pedal to pop up the top — so that you can
avoid touching the top and spreading germs. You can also find a
model that “detects” movement within six inches and automati-
cally pops its top.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 109

If you have space in your kitchen, include recycling bins and enjoy
the convenience of dropping in your rinsed-out plastics and glass
close by rather than walking the materials out to the garage.
Doing the Dishes
When my kids were growing up, they’d tell me tales of friends
whose families ate every meal from throwaway plates and cups as
to eliminate the washing of dishes.
I can appreciate the desire to avoid the daily repetition of doing
the dishes. But we have a greater understanding, today, that toss-
ing plates, cups, and utensils consumes immeasurably more
resources and energy than the effort it takes to wash up the
reusable ones.
The big debate now: Is it more environmentally friendly to do your
dishes by hand or in the dishwasher? Opinions vary. Most sources
weigh in on the side of the automatic dishwasher.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room

Compost and collected
Starting a compost pile in your backyard is the perfect way to reduce the amount
of waste you send to the landfill each week — and to create a nutritious supple-
ment for your flower or vegetable garden.
Start collecting your kitchen scraps daily in a countertop pail or well-sealed con-
tainer. Then set up a place in your yard where you can dump the scraps, well-mixed
with yard clippings and other materials. Your compost pile can be as simple as a
pile in a place away from the house, or as sophisticated as a large purpose-made
covered plastic bin.
What to collect? Any trimmings and peelings from fruit and vegetables, egg shells,
coffee grounds, and teabags. You can even place bits of newspaper and old cloth
into the pile. Skip, however, cooked foods, meat scraps, and animal and dairy prod-
ucts, as they may attract unwelcome animals. In terms of nonfood items, be sure
they aren’t treated with any objectionable chemicals.
To turn your kitchen leftovers into “black gold” for the garden, you do need to add
more than your scraps, including a certain amount of “green” and a certain amount
of “black.” For full details on composting, read Organic Gardening For Dummies
(Wiley) by Ann Whitman and The Editors of the National Gardening Association.

The pros and cons of automatic 
dishwashers
An automatic dishwasher’s efficiency depends on several factors:
 Newer, Energy Star dishwashers use less energy, less water,
and less hot water than other models — especially those man-
ufactured before 1994. If you’re ready to replace your old
model, visit www.energystar.gov for research about the ben-
efits and efficient operation of dishwashers.
 Running your dishwasher with a full load cuts down on the
number of loads you do, reducing energy and water usage. If
you’re single or have a small family, you may need to run it
only every other day, or less.
 Taking advantage of the dishwasher’s most energy-efficient
settings improves energy efficiency, too. Choose the air-dry
feature and avoid the heat-dry, rinse-hold, or pre-rinse options.
Do review the manufacturer’s instructions for use. (If missing, go to
the manufacturer’s Web site.) Some models require you to dis-
pense detergent for each load, while others have a place to insert a
bottle of detergent, which dispenses just the right amount based
on water hardness, cycle selection, and soil level of the dishes.
From a green perspective, dishwashers may have some drawbacks:
 If you find yourself pre-rinsing or scraping your dishes manu-
ally before placing them in the dishwasher, you’re doing
double-duty.
 Water-saving or energy-saving dishwashers may or may not
work well. Using the no-heat option may make the cycle run
longer or leave glasses spotty. Some appliance experts sug-
gest adding a rinse agent, which prevents water from beading
and causing marks. However, a rinse agent adds another set of
chemicals to the process.
Most conventional automatic dishwashing detergents contain phos-
phates or chlorine. (For more about the dangers of these two ele-
ments, see Chapter 3.) Green brands eliminate these ingredients, but
many find that dishes don’t come as clean and spot-free, especially if
you have hard water. This factor alone may be enough to persuade
you to stick to hand-washing. Otherwise, check the Appendix for
some companies that make environmentally safe automatic dish-
washer detergents.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 111

Doing dishes by hand
Some people may find that hand-washing is more energy efficient,
particularly if they have small households. I know a woman who
lives by herself — she says it’d take her two weeks to fill up her
dishwasher. She places a dish tub in each of her two sinks, half-fills
one with hot soapy water and the other with hot rinse water, does
her day’s worth of accumulated dishes, and then lets them air-dry
on a rack. In summer, she uses the dirty dishwater on her garden.
The vegetable-based dish liquid helps deter certain pests.
To make the most of washing by hand, follow these tips:
 Use hot water. Protect your hands with dish gloves. (When fin-
ished, turn gloves inside-out, sprinkle with baking soda, and
allow to air-dry.)
 To avoid running the water while washing, fill the basin with
enough hot soapy water to cover or immerse dishes. Then fill a
dish tub or the other side of the sink with hot water for rinsing.
 Use a mild but grease-cutting dish soap that contains plant-
based surfactants rather than bleach- or ammonia-based
cleaners. Plenty of green brands are on the market. Or you
can make your own from one of the recipes in Chapter 6.
 Add a tablespoon or two of baking soda to hot, sudsy dishwa-
ter to cut the grease and loosen sticky foods on dishes.
 Add vinegar to the tubs of rinse water to eliminate the suds.
 Towel dry or — better — air-dry on a plate rack next to the
sink. Air-drying is the most sanitary practice, as damp dish-
towels collect germs.
Getting Down to Clean Floors
The following are the greenest cleaning tips for most floors, unless
otherwise indicated:
 To keep floors cleaner longer, put floor mats at outside
entrances into the kitchen, as well as one in front of the sink
and under pet food/water areas.
 Vacuum or sweep the floor to remove loose dirt. Brooms have
been improved to have bumper guards so that they’re less
likely to dent cabinets or furniture. When sweeping, use short,
powerful strokes and a dust pan.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
112

 Damp mop once a week or as needed, using a mild cleaning
solution, either a commercial green solution or one of the
recipes in Chapter 6. Some of the best recipes include white
distilled vinegar and maybe some liquid soap.
 Choose a porous sponge mop with an abrasive strip for coaxing
stuck-on gunk, or use a mop with a reusable microfiber head.
 Consider an electric steam cleaner, also called a steam mop,
which uses nothing more than tap water. This cleaner is espe-
cially great for tile, marble, slate, and sealed-wood surfaces.
(See Chapter 5 for more on steam mops.)
 Do not wax kitchen floors because that makes them slippery.
A properly sealed floor should provide enough shine, which
re-emerges on a dry mopping or damp mopping.
Wet floors are slippery. Don’t let anyone in the kitchen until the floor
is dry. And be careful not to leave standing puddles of water — bad
for the air (encourages mildew) and the floor.
Tackling the toughest floor problems
Everyday dirt, such as food and drink spills, clean up easily, but
some substances pose out-of-the-ordinary challenges:
 Dried paint: Carefully chip away with a putty knife and follow
with a green all-purpose floor cleaner.
 Shoe scuff marks: Rubbing with a sock should take it them
away. If not, apply a green cleaner with a soft cloth and buff dry.
 Chewing gum and candle wax: Apply ice wrapped in an old
T-shirt or in a muslin bag to the gum or wax, and it should
flake off with a putty knife. (Don’t have a putty knife? A butter
knife will do — what you don’t want is something sharp and
pointy which may gouge the floor.)
Cleaning the Kitchen Sink
Green concerns aside, conventional cleaners include abrasive pow-
dered cleansers and chlorine-based formulas, which aren’t good
for many sink materials. Additionally, manufacturers may recom-
mend certain specialty cleaners for their sinks. Whether these
products are ecofriendly is hard to know, as manufacturers don’t
typically advertise the ingredients. (See Chapter 3 for more on find-
ing out which ingredients you want to avoid.)
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 113

Kitchen sinks come in many materials. In most cases, a similar
cleaning routine applies for all:
1. Routinely wipe out the sink with water to keep foods,
oils, and stains from building up.
2. For a good cleaning, add a few drops of the same soap
you use for your dishes into your sink.
Use hand-washing dish soap, not automatic dish detergent.
Baking soda is an alternative to dish soap, or you can use a
combination of both.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
114
Stepping up to sustainable-material floors
Traditional flooring includes linoleum, tile, vinyl, and hardwood. More and more new
kitchen designs are welcoming sustainable, rapidly renewable, or recycled-
content flooring materials. Many options are available in easily installed tiles or
squares that snap into place without the need for formaldehyde-based adhesives
or off-gassing finishes.
Almost all the following materials are easy to clean with a bucket of warm water
and mild liquid soap:
 Cork: This sustainable material has hypoallergenic qualities, absorbs sound,
and is easily cleaned. It does scratch easily and requires sealing and resealing
to protect from water damage.
 Bamboo: A great alternative to hardwood, rapidly renewable bamboo is grass
on steroids. Resistant to dust mites, mildew, and lint, bamboo is typically avail-
able in tongue-and-groove strips like traditional hardwood floors.
 Marmoleum: This brand of linoleum flooring is made of linseed oil, rosins, wood
flours, and limestone. Available in an array of vivid colors and contemporary
designs, this is not your father’s linoleum. Best of all, it provides an easy-to-
clean floor with antibacterial properties that prevent breeding of many 
microorganisms.
To clean Marmoleum, use a dust or damp mop and a simple solution of  1⁄8-cup
plant-based liquid soap in a bucket of water. The makers of Marmoleum don’t
recommend vinegar for cleaning.
 Concrete: Although concrete demands lots of energy to manufacture, its insu-
lative properties and tough wear may make up for the embodied energy it
requires.
 Recycled rubber: Another natural and renewable element, rubber is a green
flooring choice when the material is 100-percent, post-consumer content. It’s
easy on the feet and resilient.

3. Lightly wet the sink with a splash from the faucet or use a
damp sponge and wipe ’til it shines.
Avoid using anything abrasive, including steel wool or
caustic powder cleaners that could scar or pit the surface.
4. Rinse the sink with water.
5. Pat the sink dry with a towel or simply allow to air-dry.
If you have hard water, you may need to rub the sink down
with dry paper towel to remove water spots.
Above my sink on a raised counter sits a homemade round card-
board container, with holes punched in the top, that contains
baking soda and a few drops of scented oil. You can buy similar
containers or recycle something you already have for this purpose.
I just sprinkle it in the sink and on the counter when the mood
strikes, run a wet sponge through it, and get instant good smells!
Keeping material in mind
Some sink materials can pose unique cleaning challenges:
 Stainless steel: Thinner material may mean more stains, dings,
and dents, so consider your choice carefully when installing a
new stainless steel sink.
 Porcelain enamel: If yellowing is a problem, try distilled
white vinegar (a tablespoon in a cup of water) and rub the
surface with a clean cloth or sponge, let sit for a few minutes,
and rinse with water.
 Solid surface: More commonly known by brand names such
as Corian or Silestone, these surfaces are nonporous and
inhospitable to bacteria. For this reason, solid surface sinks
are often used in hospitals and fast-food restaurants. For rou-
tine care, check with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
 Copper and brass: These materials are more often used as
bar sinks or accessory sinks. Both are very sensitive materi-
als, so follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. For a sink
that’s heavily stained, try a mixture of salt and water. Use a
soft rag or sponge and rub the sink with a mixture and then
add a little lemon juice to cleanse. Rinse with water and then
dry completely with a soft clean towel. Avoid any strong acids
or bleaches, even glass cleaners!
 Stone: A bit unusual, but granite, soapstone, and marble sinks
do exist. The best advice is to do what the manufacturer rec-
ommends. Don’t use ammonia or strong soaps or detergents.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 115

Attending to faucets, 
drains, and disposals
Don’t forget to clean your faucets, drains, and garbage disposal.
For routine cleaning, follow the same guidelines as for sinks: dish-
washing liquid or baking soda and a sponge work fine. Pour baking
soda down the drain to neutralize odors and rinse with cool water.
If the faucets are made of chrome, vinegar and water works — go
for the gleam! Remove any food remnants or soap scum around the
base — an old toothbrush helps you get into those cracks and
crevices. Attend to the pull-out sprayer. Older ones, especially, get
a lot of buildup. You can soak the sprayer in vinegar and water to
dissolve the mineral buildup.
While grinding up food in the garbage disposal may at first blush
seem green, it’s not. First, proper use of the disposal requires a lot
of water, an increasingly precious natural resource. And running the
disposal requires electricity. If you’re on a septic system, you have
to worry about sludge buildup, which can lead to serious plumbing
problems. And sewage treatment results in a sludge that winds up
in a landfill or is used as fertilizer. But with all the poisons tossed
down the nation’s drains, that material contains a lot of toxins and
harmful chemicals. So compost everything you can, throw away
anything that can damage your drains, and use your disposal with
discretion, following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Bringing on the Counter Revolution
For most countertop materials — whether the ubiquitous plastic
laminate (known to most people by its brand name, Formica) or
designer tile — wiping up with warm water and an all-purpose
cleaner, such as those presented in Chapter 6, is all it takes to keep
them clean.
Keep the following caveats in mind:
 If you have a wood countertop (which, depending on the
source, may or may not be green), avoid vinegar-based clean-
ing solutions.
 If you have a granite, marble, or stone countertop, mild dish
soap and water is the best for cleaning. Keep in mind, though,
that granite and marble can be fussy — they don’t like harsh
solutions or even highly acidic food spills and are sensitive to
heat, so use trivets and hot pads to protect counters (a good
idea for any countertop regardless of type).
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
116

 If you have a solid surface countertop, such as Corian or
Silestone, use an all-purpose cleaner or 4 tablespoons of
baking soda in 1 quart of warm water, apply with a sponge and
dry. Do not use abrasive cleaners or tools.
Making Short Work of 
Cabinet Cleaning
Most cabinets are made of solid wood or wood laminate with a par-
ticleboard base. Most particleboard contains formaldehyde, noto-
rious for off-gassing toxic content and causing indoor air pollution.
(Read Chapter 3 for more about formaldehyde.) But if your particle-
board cabinets are already in place, chances are their off-gassing
days are behind them. Simply keep them clean with a spritz of your
homemade vinegar and water solution or a store-bought, Earth-
friendly, all-purpose cleaner — both are fine for the knobs and han-
dles, as well. An alternative is a small amount of plant-based liquid
soap and water.
Solid wood cabinets are often the most expensive part of the
kitchen, so care is critical. The good news is, cabinets aren’t as
prone to the abuse that floors and countertops suffer — although
I’m always amazed at how far oil can spatter or pasta sauce can
splash. Wipe up the mess as soon as it happens, which will save
you from deep cleaning in the long run.
A dry, lintfree cloth or barely damp cloth is often all the cabinets
need for a refresher. (Do check manufacturers’ recommendations,
however, for special instructions.) A gentle wood cleaner or polish
may be in order a couple times a year. (See Chapter 6 for recipes
for wood cleaners and polishes.)
If your cabinets have glass doors, choose a recipe from Chapter 6 —
nothing works like a vinegar-based solution and newspaper or a
microfiber cloth made for glass to get a streak-free clean.
Hot Tips for Cleaning Stoves
Cooking seems to produce a level of crud, gunk, and sludge that
defies the cleaning tactics that work on other kitchen surfaces. Air-
borne pollutants, such as grease and dust, travel and spread
throughout the house. Supermarket aisles carry shelves of prod-
ucts that promise to dissolve oven and stovetop buildup. And
many of them do.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 117

These products don’t come without a cost to the environment. Not
only do many of these formulas contain extremely caustic chemi-
cals that can damage air passages, burn skin, and poison waste-
water, they often come in aerosol containers. While the propellant
CFC, which damages the ozone layer, has been banned since 1978,
aerosol cans now contain a propellant from liquid petroleum (can
you say greenhouse gas emissions?). But if you break down in des-
peration, be sure to follow directions, wear gloves when using, and
air out the room or run the fan during and after the process.
The green way to eliminate oven grease and other cooktop grime is
to use a lot of elbow grease along with some traditional cleaning
agents. You can also employ a few other tactics to pre-empt some
of the buildup:
 Avoid or limit cooking practices that increase grease and
grime. Deep-frying meat is a major gunk-producer.
 Install a cooktop backsplash, such as ceramic or glass tile,
that you can wipe clean with soap and water.
 Use an all-purpose cleaner for the cooktop, whether one of
the recipes in Chapter 6 or a storebought green, all-purpose,
or specially formulated product for the stove. (Make sure that
the burners are cool before cleaning.)
 Don’t use abrasive pads on glass or ceramic cooktops.
 Remove removable parts (racks, grates, and grate pans) to
wash in the sink or dishwasher, as necessary.
 For grease stains, dampen the spot with water and cover with
baking soda or cornstarch — both natural grease absorbers.
Give it some time to work and then rinse off with water and
wipe dry.
 From the inside of the oven, remove the racks and clean them
in the sink with soap, water, and a scrub brush, if needed.
Baking racks can get pretty filthy, so consider taking them out-
side and rinsing them off with the garden hose.
 While the oven is still slightly warm, cover baked-on food with
table salt. After it cools, scrape away the salt and spills and
wipe with a damp sponge.
 Prevent spills in the oven by using the proper size of baking
pan or cookware. If your food is likely to bubble or spill over,
place a larger pan or cookie sheet underneath to catch the
overflow. It’s a lot easier to wash one pan in the sink or dish-
washer than scrub the inside of your oven.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
118

Many modern ovens have a self-cleaning feature (no chemicals nec-
essary): Essentially, it burns off the spills so that you can easily
wipe out the remains. Check your manufacturer’s guidelines for use.
The Ins and Outs of Refrigerator
Cleaning
The refrigerator consumes the most energy of any indoor home
appliance — more than the washer and dryer combined. It probably
doesn’t help that it’s also one of the most frequented places in the
home. A constant open-and-close of the door adds dollars to your
electric bill and increases the opportunity for bacteria growth on the
food inside as well as the door handle, which is a bacteria magnet.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 119
It pays to buy green
Since 1994, Energy Star, the energy program managed by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, has been rating some of the
home’s biggest energy consumers for their efficiency. In the beginning, consumer
ratings challenged the effectiveness of these machines, the increased cost, and
the return on investment in terms of energy savings. Manufacturers have come a
long way, and refrigerators, dishwashers, and other appliances are increasingly
efficient. In some cases, even the cost gap is closing up.
Pre-1994 refrigerators, for example, use almost twice as much energy as the newest
Energy Star–rated refrigerators. A visit to the Energy Star Web site (www.energy
star.gov) offers tips for selecting the lowest-energy option, such as:
 Look for the yellow Energy Star EnergyGuide label.
 Buy the smallest, most efficient refrigerator you need.
 Choose a top-mounted freezer model — the side-by-side models and bottom-
mount freezers use more energy.
It still pays, however, to carefully research your options before investing in a major
appliance. Compare price and efficiency ratings and review consumer comments
and rating services before you buy.

A cleaning tip to reduce 
your utility bill
How you clean your refrigerator can also affect your monthly
energy costs. Take a peek at the back of the fridge, and you see a
rack-like attachment — those are the condenser coils, and they’re
a magnet for dust bunnies, pet hair, and lint. Just as the human
heart has to pump harder for the overweight person, the refrigera-
tor motor must exert more effort when its coils are coated and
clogged with dirt.
A good brushing every couple months makes your refrigerator
more efficient. But take some precaution when cleaning. First,
follow any special instructions from the manufacturer. Unplug the
unit, and then use your vacuum’s crevice tool or a coil-cleaning
brush. Hardware and home supply stores also sell appliance
brushes for this purpose.
Other tips for lowering your energy consumption, from the
American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (www.
aceee.org), are as follows:
 Keep your refrigerator at 36 to 39°F and your freezer between
0 and 5°F.
 Make sure that air can circulate behind the refrigerator where
coils are.
 Don’t place the refrigerator near a heat source — it has to
work harder there.
 Check door seals for leaks — if a dollar bill remains in place
when you close the door, the seal is good.
 Keep your freezer full.
 Wait for hot foods to cool before placing in the refrigerator.
 Minimize the opening and closing of the door.
Purging and cleaning the fridge
Part of keeping a clean refrigerator is purging it of food that has
gone bad. When lettuce or onions begin to putrefy in your veg-
etable bin, when you suspect the milk carton now contains some-
thing more akin to cottage cheese, when that jar of tomato salsa
gives new meaning to eating “green,” you know you’ve let things go.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
120

In an ideal green world, you always buy the exact quantities of food
you can use before the expiration date. But face it, you have your
own reality show going on, and lots of the food in your fridge gets
voted off the menu by your tribe of survivors.
The best time to clean out your refrigerator is before grocery shop-
ping. Wasting food is certainly not a very sustainable principle, so
as you review the contents, consider the following before tossing:
 Add veggies and fruits past their prime to the compost bin.
 If your eggs are well past the expiration date, crack them open
and toss the shells into the compost.
 Toss the solidified ketchup and mold-topped bean dip and
rinse and recycle their plastic or glass containers.
To clean the inside of the fridge, remove the remaining food items
and, using a top-down approach, start cleaning the top shelf,
wiping with a sponge or rag soaked in a bucket of warm water and
dish soap or warm water and baking soda mixture, working your
way down. Finish with a good wipe-down of the outside — don’t
forget the door handle.
Several times a year, remove the glass shelves and the drawers (for
deli, meat, fruit, and vegetables) and clean them in the sink using
hot, sudsy water. Rinse well, drain, and dry them before putting
them back in the refrigerator.
After the refrigerator is sparkling clean, add an open box of baking
soda to absorb odors. You can certainly use one of the baking soda
air filters, with a replacement indicator that shows when it is time
to change it. But why, when a small box of the real stuff is so cheap
and easy to use? (Less packaging and plastic means less energy
and resources expended.)
Whether to unplug the refrigerator and freezer for an exhaustive
deep cleaning is a decision you’ll have to make based on the condi-
tion of the appliance and what the manufacturer says. I hesitate to
say more than this because what you do depends on the type of
refrigerator and freezer you have.
If you have ice trays, throw out old, funky-smelling or -looking ice.
As far as overall advice goes:
 Wear gloves.
 Do not use ice picks or other sharp objects.
 Take care in washing lights, switches, and control dials.
Chapter 7: Everything in the Kitchen — Including the Sink 121

 If you’re cleaning out the freezer, put the food removed into
an ice-filled, ice chest.
 Remember to put everything back and replug, if necessary.
Keeping Small Appliances Clean
Microwave ovens, toasters, blenders, mixers — if your kitchen is
like most, you have a cadre of small devices that assist with food
preparation, often getting a daily workout. These appliances,
depending upon their specific service, need cleaning daily or 
frequently.
Many appliances contain parts that you can remove from the
motor. In these cases, treat the components as you do your dishes
and cookware and wash by hand or in the dishwasher. Always be
sure to unplug the devices before cleaning and follow these tips for
specific appliances:
 Microwave ovens: All-purpose or glass cleaner works fine for
the outside. Wipe the inside with a green all-purpose cleaner
or liquid soap and water and dry thoroughly. Wipe the glass
turntable often and put in the dishwasher when needed.
Depending on the buildup you get, you may want to use a
baking soda or cornstarch paste.
 Toasters and toaster ovens: Unplug before cleaning. Use a glass
or all-purpose cleaner on the outside. Turn upside-down and
dump the crumbs into the sink. Clean the counter underneath.
 Blenders: Wash the container portion after every use. One
method is to pour soapy water in and turn on the blender —
some models have a dedicated button for this function. You
can also remove the container-and-blade portion, take it
apart, and then wash the pieces separately by hand or in the
dishwasher. Wipe down the base with soap and water or a
mild all-purpose cleaner. Clean the counter underneath.
The blades can cut you, so watch your hands.
 Mixers: The beaters go in the dishwasher or sink. Wipe the
base with soap and water or an all-purpose cleaner. Large,
stand-on-the-counter models should be cleaned as recom-
mended by the maker. You can hand-wash stainless steel
bowls or put them in the dishwasher.
 Coffee makers: Check the manufacturer’s instructions. As a
rule, simply wipe down drip coffee makers with soap and
water or mild cleaner. You can wash the coffee pot in the sink
or dishwasher.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
122

To reduce paper waste with throwaway filters, use a gold
coffee filter, which can last for years. If you’re stuck on toss-
aways, choose unbleached, dioxin-free paper filters — then
compost them along with your coffee grounds.
Speed Cleaning: What You Can Do
in Less Than 15 Minutes
Your spouse is on the way home — with unannounced guests in
tow. An army of kids has just left your kitchen looking like a
combat zone. Where to start? The clock is ticking!
No need to panic. I’m here to assure you that all you need are 15
minutes to whip any room in your house into company condition.
Just zero in on the big-impact actions and tackle those first. Here’s
a quick-fix strategy for conquering a kitchen mess:
 Put food away.
 Take care of dirty dishes: Put them in the dishwasher or in
soapy water in the sink.
 Wipe up obvious spills with a reusable towel.
 Wipe counter, table/island, and faucet — spritz first with 
vinegar-and-water cleaner.
 Take out or hide trash/recyclables.
 Give the floor a once-over with a dry mop or vacuum.

I
f ever there was a room where cleanliness is highly valued, the
bathroom is the place. After all, it’s the Grand Central Station of
personal clean in the home. Within these walls, you tend to your
personal hygiene, scrubbing, soaking, lathering, brushing, exfoliating,
tweezing, shaving, and making yourself presentable to the world.
The bathroom — even those pretty little rooms you reserve for
guests and refer to as the powder room — also poses some of the
greatest challenges to clean, let alone clean green. First of all, it’s
the most private room of the house, and I probably don’t need to
go into more detail as to why it has hygiene issues. Secondly, in the
process of removing dirt from your body, you’re also creating a lot
of residue that sticks around: Soap scum clings to tile walls and the
shower curtain; shaving cream and toothpaste detritus coat the
sink; and hair shavings, nail clippings, and sloughed-off dead skin
find their way into corners and crevices.
And then there’s the whole water issue. If your home were its own
little world, the bathroom would be the rainforest: warm, moist,
with lots of living organisms rarely seen — but not the kind that
can lead to medicinal breakthroughs. The high humidity factor
turns the bathroom into the perfect petri dish for bacteria, mildew,
and more.

In this chapter, I offer tips to reduce your cleaning burden in the
bathroom and advice on conserving water and minimizing damp-
ness-induced problems. I also show you how to whip through the
bathroom killing germs and restoring order.
Getting Wise to Preemptive
Practices
You can avert, postpone, or minimize major cleanup by incorporat-
ing some healthy bathroom habits. The bonus? Changing some of
your most basic hygiene practices can go a long way in reducing
germs and other unwelcome problems.
A new kind of toilet training
It’s a delicate subject and I’ll do my best to maintain decorum: The
toilet is the source of one of the home’s dreaded cleaning jobs. The
worst of it can be minimized by some healthy toilet hygiene.
Close the lid on toilet spray. I’m not talking about the gender war
between “seat up or seat down,” but keeping the bowl covered —
especially before you flush. Shut the lid and then flush. Then, what-
ever is in there stays there (kind of like Vegas). Some toilets have a
powerful force. Even if you can’t see any spray, you can trust that
those bacteria are flying and landing in the area, on the cabinet
next to the toilet, and perhaps even on the sink ledge where your
toothbrush sits.
Diving into the reduced-
flush-policy debate
This section covers another awkward topic, but it’s one that anyone
who lives in a drought-prone area of the country is sensitive to.
Understanding that the toilet is the home’s biggest water hog, is it
responsible to flush after every visit?
What a dilemma for a person who wants to be clean and green. The
fact is, leaving an unflushed toilet — even if only fluid waste —
allows time for bacteria-breeding. But also realize that every flush
consumes as many as 7 gallons of water in older toilets.
If you’re living with older-model toilets or in an area that suffers
from water shortage, I offer dispensation to “let it mellow,” as they
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
126

say. But only for a few hours, or from your last visit at night until
your wakeup stop in the morning. If only one or two members of
the household are using a particular john, a “reduced-flush” policy
is probably manageable. Several household members using a single
toilet, on the other hand, may require more frequent flushing.
And if you’re flushing less often, you want to clean more frequently.
One tip is to keep a gallon of white distilled vinegar under the sink
and pour a quarter-cup or so into the bowl or tank every other day.
Spending 20 seconds on your hands
In every restaurant restroom, you find a sign that admonishes all
employees to wash their hands before returning to work. Wouldn’t
you be horrified if you saw your waitperson or chef coming out of
a stall and marching right back into the dining room or kitchen?
Research continues to prove how effective soap and warm water
are at killing disease-carrying germs and reducing illness. Hand
washing is especially important in the bathroom.
In Chapter 6, I explain why it’s critical to wash your hands with
soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. In the bathroom,
before washing, put the toilet lid down, wash hands, and then flush
with a clean hand so as not to spread germs on the handle. (Of
course this only works if the person who preceded you did the
same thing.)
Have you noticed that many newer or remodeled public restrooms
are designed so that minimal contact with bathroom surfaces is
needed? First, many restroom entrances are set up so that you
don’t have to open a door to leave (no touching a dirty handle).
Toilets, water faucets and soap dispensers may be sensor-operated.
And, finally, sensor-triggered hand dryers finish you up. The hand
dryer is also a sustainably smart way to dry: The dryer requires
minimal energy, particularly if it’s timed, and you avoid wasting all
that paper towel.
In your own bathroom, reduce opportunities to spread germs on
surfaces from dirty hands: Put a waste can with a pedal opener in
the bathroom. You can also install pedal-operated water faucets if
you want to take it to the next level.
Running the fan
Moisture from showering and washing lingers in the air, promoting
the growth of mold and mildew over time. A musty odor is the
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 127

least of the problems: Some forms of mold can aggravate and
cause allergies, and, hidden from view, spread throughout the
infrastructure and framework of the home. In some rare cases,
homeowners have had to tear out large areas of the house.
Signs of humidity problems are easy to see or smell. You may spot
moisture stains on walls and ceilings, discover the gray tentacles
of mildew spreading in your shower grout, or find whitish, pow-
dery mildew on fabric or furniture in or near your bathroom.
A working bathroom fan does a lot more than remove unpleasant
odors; it provides needed ventilation and air circulation in a wet,
enclosed space. Make sure that you switch it on during and after a
shower or bath. Turn it on as soon as you turn on the shower and
keep it on at least ten minutes after you’ve finished your shower. If
the bathroom is an interior room with no windows for air circula-
tion, run it longer.
Other tips for reducing humidity and risk of mildew and mold
include the following:
 Leave the shower curtain or door open after your shower so
that the bath area can dry.
 Keep the bathroom door open after showering or bathing.
 For rooms that get little circulation and seem to develop
mildew quickly, a dehumidifier may help suck moisture from
the air. There’s an energy cost attached, but the payoff may be
worth the effort.
 Verify that your exhaust fan is connected correctly so that the
air is forced outside of the house and not blasted into the
attic or another area of the house. Have your ducts checked.
 Make sure that windows are well sealed: Cold air leaking into
the house exacerbates condensation and humidity problems.
Replace worn weatherstripping around windows.
If you think you have a mold problem, don’t let it grow worse and
risk permanent damage to your home or your health. To find certi-
fied contractors who specialize in mold removal, contact the

Turning Down the Drain on Water
When it comes to water usage in the home, the bathroom beats all
the other rooms. Bathroom activity consumes nearly half of your
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
128

home’s water, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. The toilet, by itself, flushes away as much as 26 percent of
total household water usage — if you have an older-model toilet,
that amount may be as much as 40 percent. Teamed up with its
cohorts, the sink, shower, and tub, these guys outwash the washer,
the dishwasher, and the kitchen sink combined.
Flush with water savings
Toilets manufactured before 1993 used an average of 3.5 gallons
per flush (gpf) — some as much as 7 gpf — earning them the noto-
rious distinction of the home’s biggest water consumer. The first
generation of low-flow toilets drew some disappointment, with
flushes so wimpy that two flushes — sometimes three — were
required to do the job.
Today’s low-flows work much better. If your toilet was installed
after 1992, chances are it uses 1.6 gpf or less. Newer options are on
the market, too. A dual-flush toilet gives you a choice of 1.6 gpf for
solid waste, and a scant .9 gpf for liquid waste.
Follow these tips to reduce your use of water through flushing:
 Fix any leaks immediately. If you think you may have a leak,
your next water bill ought to make it clear. If you’re uncertain,
squeeze a few drops of blue or green food coloring into the
tank and check in 15 minutes. If the water in the bowl changes
color, you’ve got a leak.
 Fill a 2-liter soda bottle with water and set it in the toilet
tank. This trick displaces water and saves water every time
you flush. Note: Some fixture manufacturers do not recom-
mend this solution for the long-term.
 Collect some of the shower waste water that goes down the
drain while you wait for it to warm up and pour it into the
toilet. Again, it saves whatever amount you displace.
 To take green to the next level, consider a composting toilet.
This setup sends waste into a self-contained composter, 
turning it from sewage into a useful garden amendment.
 Install an under-the-sink, gray-water box, which channels
the soapy water from the sink to the toilet. The box filters
and disinfects. For more information, contact AQUS Water-
Saver Technologies at www.watersavertech.com.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 129

Of showerheads and faucets
Save the environment and reduce your water bill by eliminating
sources of water drain in faucets and showerheads. Showerheads
manufactured before 1993 can flow at the rate of 4.5 to 7 gallons
per minute. That’s a lot of water.
A federal law now requires manufacturers to keep showerhead flow
at a maximum 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm). But low-flow shower-
heads, with gpm rates as low as 1.5, are cropping up. The EPA’s
WaterSense rating on showerheads is an indication that the prod-
uct is 20 percent or more efficient than the standard.
Don’t be put off by rumors of wimpy pressure. Both aerating
heads, which pump air into the water, and non-aerating devices
deliver strong spray. Some create bigger droplets and denser spray
coverage at a mere 1.5 gallons per minute.
Choose a showerhead with a dual-control lever so that you can
reduce water flow when soaping up. One model has a smaller
hand-held wand with less flow, while still offering the stronger
stream at a gpm of 2.5.
Aerators can also help reduce water flow from sinks and tub
faucets. Faucets typically release approximately 3.5 gpm; older
faucets release as much as 7 gpm. Look for aerated faucets with a
WaterSense label. These faucets should reduce water flow by 
30 percent, to .5 to 2 gpm. The EPA identifies what to look for in
water efficient bathroom sink faucets at www.epa.gov.
Heating water: A tankless job
The temperature of the water and the amount you use have an
energy impact as well. The more hot water you use, the higher
your energy consumption. In the bathroom, the shower uses 
37 percent of the home’s hot water, compared to the clothes
washer at 26 percent, according to Energy Star. Traditional water
heaters keep hot water stored in tanks of anywhere from 20 to 80
gallons, ready at your command. Because that hot water, kept on
the boil, has to travel from wherever the tank is to the water outlet
you’ve just turned on, you waste even more water as you wait for
the hot stuff to arrive.
Take these steps to reduce the impact of hot water usage on your
energy output:
 Set your water heater no higher than 120°F — many green
sources suggest 117°F.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
130

 Wrap your water tank in insulation so that it doesn’t have to
work as hard to keep warm. If you have a gas water heater,
keep material away from the pressure relief valve or draft
hood. (It’s always a good idea to read the manufacturer’s
product guide for any other restrictions.)
 Make sure that the water heater is in working order. Older
tanks can accumulate buildup and scale, which clogs the flow
and makes it less efficient.
 If you’re ready to replace your water heater, get a newer,
energy-efficient model.
 Place a water heater near your bathroom so that you have
faster delivery to the source.
Consider getting a tankless water heater. This smaller unit doesn’t
store water, but rather heats it instantaneously, reducing the
energy output to keep a volume of water at the ready. Currently,
tankless water heaters are pricier — to purchase and install —
than traditional water heaters. And in existing homes, it is some-
times logistically difficult to integrate.
Another green option is a solar water heater. You may not be ready
to go off the grid with a solar-powered home, but solar-powering
your water is a less dramatic change. You have an initial expense,
but by lassoing the power of the sun, you can reduce your energy
consumption by 90 percent, according to the Energy Star Web site
(www.epa.gov).
Inspiration from the camel
Saving water can be as simple as making some basic changes to
your daily hygiene habits:
 Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth.
 When washing in the sink, fill it up with enough water to clean
instead of letting the water run.
 Choose a shower over a bath; it takes as much as 70 gallons to
fill a tub; a five-minute shower uses 10 to 25 gallons, according
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
 Keep showers to five minutes.
 Turn off the shower while soaping up or shampooing.
 Capture wasted “warm-up” shower water in a bucket and use
it for the toilet, garden, or washing machine.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 131

Cleaning the Bath from 
Top to Bottom
While the bathroom poses some cleaning challenges, its major sur-
faces are fairly straightforward in terms of cleaning. Charging in
with a strategy makes shorter work of the chore (see Chapter 4). In
the bathroom, start with the least germy and easiest to clean
places (mirrors and sinks), working your way from fixture to fixture
toward the dirtiest (the toilet) area, and then finally to the floor.
Choosing safe, effective 
cleaning formulas
Bathrooms are a tough clean, to be sure, but don’t be oversold on
the super-duper, germ-obliterators that the commercials insist you
need. I cover the concerns and identify some of the most onerous
chemicals found in many conventional cleaners in Chapter 3.
Manufacturers rarely list the ingredients on the label. But you
know you’re in trouble when you see warnings such as “Danger,”
“Warning,” or “Corrosive.” The list of cleaning ingredients to avoid
is in Chapter 3, but here are the ones most likely to appear in bath-
room cleaners:
 Ammonia, commonly found in toilet bowl, floor and tile, and
all-purpose cleaners
 Chlorine bleach, an ingredient in many disinfecting surface
scrubs and toilet bowl cleaners
 Hydrochloric acid, found in toilet bowl cleaning formulas
 Sodium hydroxide (lye), a common ingredient in drain cleaners
 Sulfuric acid, also found in drain cleaners
If you’re using a formula that contains any of these ingredients,
consider multiple warnings: Never mix ammonia and chlorine
bleach because it produces a poisonous gas; store cleaners in
clearly labeled bottles; and avoid using in closed, confined areas.
Be sure to run the fan while using.
Discover more information about the ingredients in your commer-
cial cleaning products by visiting the Household Products
Database Web site (http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov) and looking up the
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
132

The safest and greenest course of action is to steer clear of these
heavy hitters and stick to the recipes included in Chapter 6 or buy
commercial products that identify themselves as plant-based.
Don’t assume that you’re green to go just because the bottle says
“nontoxic,” “all-natural,” or “biodegradable.” These terms aren’t
regulated. Also trust products that list their ingredients. Check this
book’s appendix for some companies that manufacture acceptable
products.
For your bathroom arsenal, consider the following recipes found in
Chapter 6:
 Minty Fresh All-Purpose Cleaner: Use this for the vanity top,
sink, and tile.
 Window, Glass, and Mirror Cleaner: My preference is vinegar
and water because it also works on stainless steel and chrome
fixtures.
 The Mold and Mildew Zapper for problem shower areas.
 Toilet Bowl Cleaner: For a “sizzling” experience, choose the
vinegar-and-baking-soda combo.
 Straight-up vinegar is great for getting off built-up lime and
scale, or for declogging the showerhead.
Gathering the best cleaning tools
You won’t need to grab many cleaning tools from your utility closet.
Your toilet brush is already in place, perhaps in an attractive brush
holder sitting unobtrusively behind the commode. (Some of the
brush holders I’ve seen — even in the big box stores such as Target
and Lowes — are decorative elements in their own right.) You can
keep a pumice under the sink to deal with toilet bowl stains as
needed. But otherwise, a bucket, a squirt bottle filled with green
cleaner, and lots of cleaning cloths ought to do the job.
For tough mildew stains in the sink or tub areas, you’ll need a
scrub brush or an old toothbrush for the grout. (For more tips on
gathering your equipment, see Chapter 5.)
Be liberal with the number of cloths you use to avoid spreading
germs from one surface to another. Clean more benign surfaces,
such as the mirror and sink, first. Drop the used cloths in a bucket
or laundry basket and then grab clean ones for the next task,
whether tub or shower.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 133

When it comes to the toilet, change cloths often. Clean the bowl
and the underside of the toilet seat first, and then deposit the dirty
rag in the used pile. Then grab a fresh cloth for the seat itself, and
another for the lid, tank, or handle.
I also suggest identifying certain cloths solely for toilet cleaning —
perhaps repurpose the splashy red beach towel that’s seen better
days, cutting it up into workable squares. That way, you can easily
identify them as toilet rags and keep them separate from your
other rags.
Starting with the sink
The sink and vanity area of the bathroom sees plenty of traffic. A
routine wipe-down with a gentle cleaner is a good practice for
keeping up with the daily toothpaste buildup and soap scum that
accumulates. Whether the sink is made of porcelain, stainless
steel, a synthetic material, or glass — as many of the artistic
designs currently showcased in the home magazines are — a basic
all-purpose cleaner should make short work of sink and faucet
cleaning.
Use one of the recipes included in Chapter 6 or a good, green, gen-
eral product to kill germs and shine sink surfaces and chrome fix-
tures to a gleam. For polished brass and other types of faucets,
follow the manufacturer’s instructions, but most gentle, all-purpose
cleaners are fine.
Use extra elbow grease, however, if you’re cleaning a vanity area
used for hairstyling. Hairspray tends to leave a sticky coating on
sinks and countertops, but a vinegar cleaner — or the Minty Fresh
All-Purpose Cleaner, with the added power of peppermint castile
soap (see Chapter 6) — ought to do the trick. Grab a sponge with a
scrubby side for especially tacky buildup or soap scum.
Steer clear of abrasive formulas or scrub brushes for most materi-
als to avoid scratching or damage. And never use conventional
toilet bowl cleaners for sinks, tubs, or shower areas: The chemicals
in these products are too harsh and may ruin the materials.
Taking a look at the mirror
The glass cleaners included in Chapter 6 or store-bought green for-
mulas are all good for cleaning bathroom mirrors. Spray and wipe
with a microfiber cloth made for glass. If you use a cleaning cloth
from your rag pile, choose a lintfree material.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
134

For splatters of toothpaste, soap, or cosmetics, you may want to
spot-wipe with a damp cloth and a little liquid soap, if necessary.
Newspaper is the traditional favorite for streak-free mirrors and
glass. But some people object to the mess the ink makes on their
hands or are irritated by the chemical smell of the inked paper.
That said, yesterday’s news is certainly an environmentally
friendly way to clean glass. The soy-based inks of the black-and-
white pages (don’t use the comics or the shiny color advertising
inserts) are benign; in fact, organic gardeners recommend their use
in composting and layering under soil to prevent weeds.
Clean the mirror before or after you wipe down the sink area. My
cleaning style is to whip through the house, spray bottle and cloth
in hand, and clean every glass surface in the house before I begin
my room-to-room attack. Do what works for you.
Rubbing the tub and 
scouring the shower
When it comes to cleaning the tub and shower area, the materials
you’re most likely to be dealing with are prefabricated tub-and-
shower surrounds made of polyester and acrylic, vitreous porce-
lain, stainless steel, tile, or stone. Most easily stand up to the basic
all-purpose formulas included in Chapter 6, with a few exceptions.
This simple routine works for most bath and shower cleaning:
 Use a basic all-purpose cleaner to wipe away grime on bath
surfaces and fixtures.
 For soap, lime, and scale buildup, bring in the vinegar. If your
all-purpose cleaner already contains vinegar, up the amount
to full strength. Soak your cleaning cloth and rub away on tile,
porcelain, and chrome fixtures.
 Clean glass shower doors with the same cleaner that you used
for the mirror — a solution of vinegar and water, or another of
the glass recipes in Chapter 6.
 To reduce soap buildup on glass doors, wipe down with a
squeegee after each shower.
 For stubborn mildew, use the Mold and Mildew Zapper recipe,
which features tea tree oil (see Chapter 6). Another antidote
for mildew is hydrogen peroxide.
 Avoid steel wool, scrub brushes, scrub pads, and abrasive
cleaners on any bath surfaces — they’re just too harsh for the
materials and can scratch and damage them.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 135

Material challenges
Some shower and tub materials pose more challenges than others.
Stainless steel is prone to dings and scratches. Stone and marble
may require special attention. And although tile itself is a breeze to
keep clean, the stuff that holds it together — grout — is something
else. Sometimes it seems like mildew is holding the tiles together.
Here are a couple of cheats: Tile your bath area with larger tiles
that yield less grout to keep clean. Or use a tinted grout that off-
sets your tile in an attractive way and hides the dinginess that
comes with age.
A hand-held steam cleaner is handy. Another approach is to rub a
paste of baking soda or borax on the grout, let it dry, and wet.
Then remove the paste with a soft-bristled toothbrush.
Of whirlpool tub jets and showerheads
Those holes in the showerhead and the whirlpool tub jets tend to
draw more than their fair share of gunk, which clogs the openings
or releases the occasional black, gooey discharge. In both cases,
vinegar — once again — is your hero.
You’re most likely to have black gunk shoot out of whirlpool jets if
you haven’t used the jets for several months. A plumber gave my
mom this remedy for the “swamp thing” in the whirlpool jets:
1. Fill the tub so that the jets are immersed.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
136
Green bath design
If you’re facing down a bath remodel, you have a great opportunity to bring some
sustainable building principles into play. If, for example, you must tear out an exist-
ing tub or shower area because of water damage, you may want to consider an
environmentally friendly material to replace it.
Homeowners often opt for the one-piece shower-and-tub surrounds manu-
factured from fiberglass-reinforced plastic. This option is convenient, as most are
molded with soap dishes and towel bars and are a snap to keep clean — but green,
they’re not.
The embodied energy cost to extract and manufacture stone is high, but the mate-
rial is durable. Tile also carries an energy cost, but much of the tile available now is
made of at least some recycled content. And tile is blessedly reusable and 
recyclable, too.

2. Add a half-gallon of white distilled vinegar.
3. Turn on the jets and let run for five minutes.
4. Turn off, drain the tub, and repeat the process.
5. Take a cloth and clean out any remaining gunk in the jets.
For a clogged-up showerhead, simply remove it and let it soak
overnight in a bucket with water and vinegar, at a 1-to-1 ratio. Rinse
and put back on. If it’s in really bad shape, you may want to take
this opportunity to replace it with a new low-flow showerhead.
Toilet talk
Be diligent about keeping the toilet area clean. Getting your house-
hold into the habit of closing the lid before flushing and washing
their hands helps reduce the risk of spreading bacteria, but routine
cleaning of the toilet — at least once a week — is necessary to
flush out the germs.
Most toilets are made of vitreous china, which makes them
extremely easy to clean. Seats may be made of a different material:
enameled wood or that soft, padded plastic that makes for a cushy
experience.
In most cases, a nonabrasive, all-purpose cleaner works well for
cleaning the outside of the toilet, tank, lid, seat, and bowl. Choose
from the cleaners in Chapter 6 or a commercial green product.
Vinegar-based solutions help kill bacteria. After cleaning your
toilet, remember to immediately set aside cloths for the wash and
not use them on any other surface.
If you pour in your toilet bowl cleaner first thing as you start to
clean your bathroom, you’ve got a head start on a tough job.
Ingredients for bowl cleaners are stronger than those used for the
other bathroom surfaces. The recipes I include in Chapter 6 have
borax or washing soda or a combination of baking soda and vinegar.
Let the cleaner sit in the toilet for at least 10 minutes. For a really
grungy bowl, pour in a cup of borax, which acts as a water sof-
tener, sanitizer, and deodorizer, and let it sit overnight. Then swish
and scrub with the toilet brush. Don’t neglect the area you can’t
see just under the rim inside the toilet, which is where ugly mildew
really collects. Tackle stains with your pumice, wearing plastic
gloves to protect your hands. Then scrub, close the lid, and flush.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 137

When using conventional cleaners with caustic chemicals, be espe-
cially careful not to splash when pouring in the cleaner. Ammonia,
bleach, lye, and other ingredients can burn your skin and eyes. Even
commercially available green toilet bowl cleaners have cautions.
After the inside of the bowl is clean, you’re ready to give the out-
side of the toilet — lid, seat, tank — a good wipe-down with your
preferred all-purpose cleaner. Don’t forget to clean the handle!
Getting to the bottom 
of floor cleaning
Bathroom floors tend to be of the same types of materials as other
bathroom surfaces: those that stand up well to water and that wipe
clean with a sponge. The other good news is that, as a rule, bath-
room floors aren’t as big as floors in other areas of the house, so
keeping up with the floor cleaning doesn’t take much more effort
than a quick zip-through with the mop. After all the above-floor
surfaces are cleaned, vacuum the floor to pick up loose hair and
dust. Then clean with water and a floor cleaner best-suited for
your floor type. In most cases, any of the all-purpose cleaners or
commercial green cleaners are fine. But do follow the manufacturer’s
guidelines when choosing a cleaning product. Other options include
 A store-bought mop system. Most include an ergonomically
shaped mop with a washable microfiber head and a gentle
squirt-and-mop formula, no buckets of water required.
 An electric steam cleaner — skip the cleaning formula alto-
gether. Just use water and steam, a great solution for tile and
sealed wood floors. Lightweight models heat up in 60 seconds
or less and, with swivel heads, they can reach those corners
and hard-to-reach spaces, such as behind the toilet. (For more
on steam cleaners, see Chapter 5.)
The Softer Side: Towels 
and Textiles
The splashes of color that towels and textiles lend to the bath are
simply a bonus to their hard work, keeping you — or the room —
dry. Switching out towels, the shower curtain, and the bath mat
can liven up a room and offer a quick cosmetic pickup to a look
that’s grown tired.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
138

But whether you’re hanging up brand-new organic towels or still
clinging to the sets you’ve had for decades, you want to clean your
linens on a regular basis. Remember, the bathroom gets humid;
towels, throw rugs, bath mats, and shower curtains get wet; and
bacteria can grow.
Hanging them out to dry
In terms of weighing in on the green-o-meter, changing towels fre-
quently isn’t exactly the most Earth-friendly practice. In fact, as
hotels and resorts get more savvy to sustainability issues, most are
offering a linen reuse service in which guests have the option to
reuse their towels without changing them, or at least changing
them less frequently during their stay.
From an environmental standpoint, that’s a good one to pack up
and bring home. (I mean the practice, not the towels!) Yet in the
interest of cleanliness and hygiene, you need to change the towels
often enough that bacteria aren’t allowed to grow in a damp envi-
ronment. So hang up those towels after you use them instead of
heaping them in the corner.
A towel bar or shower curtain rod instead of a towel hook allows
the material to spread out for faster and more complete drying.
Add a towel bar positioned where it gets more circulation — on a
wall across from the entry rather than behind the door.
Thinner towels may serve you better, in this respect, than thick,
lush towels. When I was newly married, I made the mistake of
buying oversized bath sheets. The darn things were so big, we
couldn’t spread them out on the towel bar, and they never dried.
To top it off, one towel nearly took up the whole washer.
Don’t forget to change hand towels regularly. If they’re used by sev-
eral members of the household, change them every day. And if you
have guests over, to avoid the environmental expense of fancy
paper hand towels, get out those guest towels stowed away in the
back of your linen closet. Afterward, wash and reuse for the next
party.
If you’re ready to replace old, threadbare towels, walk past the
antibacterial towels that are now on the market. They may contain
the same ingredient that’s in antibacterial soap — triclosan, which
has been linked with bacterial resistance and pollution. (For more
information on triclosan, see Chapter 4.) And cleaning these towels
can actually increase the harm: When triclosan mixes with chlori-
nated water, chloroform, a known carcinogen, can form.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 139

When replacing towels, look for the following:
 100-percent organic cotton, grown without petroleum-based
pesticides
 Bamboo-fabric towels, soft, absorbent, and made of rapidly
renewable and naturally antibacterial bamboo
 Untreated, unbleached towels, free of chlorine and chemicals
used to add softness and absorbency
 Hemp or hemp-blend towels with no chemical treatment
As far as washing goes, read the labels on your towels and follow
the instructions. From an environmental standpoint, cold-water
wash is best, which may be fine. But because towels can be such
germ-carriers, you may want to switch to warm. If your household
has had some illness, I’d go for hot water. If you can, hang the
towels out in the sun for added disinfection and pop them in the
dryer just before they’re dry if you want them to feel fluffy and
soft.
Of mats, rugs, and toilet seat covers
Carpeted floors and high humidity just don’t mix. If you have car-
peting, consider replacing it with something more water-friendly.
Bath mats and area rugs can provide a soft, warm surface after a
shower, and they’re easy to throw in the washer.
Bath mats are heavier than towels and lighter than throw rugs.
Their beauty is their easy cleaning and quicker drying time. Rugs
handle more wear, and you can shake them out between cleanings.
Either should be machine washable — if it requires professional
cleaning, it doesn’t belong in the bathroom!
Once the sign of a well-appointed bathroom, rug and toilet-cover
sets — you know, those shaggy little coverings for the tank and
toilet seat — are all but extinct. And they should be. Mine is not a
fashion commentary: Covering your toilet with unnecessary mate-
rial that can get dirty and harbor bacteria just doesn’t make sense.
Vinyl or rubber bath mats clean up easily in the washing machine
in cold water and whatever laundry detergent you use. Two table-
spoons of white vinegar in the rinse water will freshen a mat. Hang
it outside to dry or in a rack in the bathtub — don’t put it in the
dryer.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
140

Raising the bar on shower curtains
Although more contemporary bath designs are going for frameless
glass shower doors, shower curtains are still a standard in the tra-
ditional bathroom. Most shower coverings consist of an inner liner,
typically of vinyl or PVC plastic, which keeps water from the area
outside the tub and shower; the outer curtain is the pretty part
that matches your decor and enhances the look of the bath. These
curtains are typically made from some sort of washable material —
just slip it from the curtain rings and toss in the wash.
Do wash these outer curtains as frequently as you wash other
bathroom textiles, such as bath mats. The inner liner may take
more attention because it’s where mildew is most likely to collect
and grow. In fact, you can probably find some black or gray
buildup at the bottom of your liner right now.
If vinyl or plastic, you can clean with an all-purpose cleaner or a
mildew-eliminating formula. (Check recipes in Chapter 6.) You can
also reduce conditions that breed mildew by wiping down the liner
after showering to remove excess water.
If you have a shower curtain that is still serviceable but gray at the
bottom, simply cut off the bottom with a pair of scissors. Now, I
grant you this option isn’t the most attractive one, but it sure is
easy and may serve as a temporary solution until you get a
replacement.
Skip the vinyl liner (remember, plastics originate from fossil fuels),
especially commonly used PVC-based products, notorious for hor-
mone-disrupting phthalates. (See Chapter 3 for more about phtha-
lates.) Instead, hang a natural-material shower curtain made of
hemp that repels water and discourages bacteria buildup, or look
for a nonvinyl liner. Check out some of the catalogs listed in the
Appendix for sources.
Taking It Personally
One other important aspect of cleaning takes place in the bath-
room — your own personal hygiene. As important to the environ-
ment as the cleaning products you use on your floors, surfaces,
and fixtures are the products you use on yourself: soaps, sham-
poos, and toothpaste. Even toilet paper, razors, and toothbrushes
have an environmental component.
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 141

Steering clear of suspected 
ingredients
Many ingredients in soaps, toiletries, and cosmetics are suspected —
and some have even been proven — to be harmful or linked to
cancer and other illnesses and conditions. Put on your reading
glasses and look for these ingredients in the fine print. Here are
just a few of the primary suspects:
 Parabens, most commonly identified as methylparaben,
propylparaben, butylparaben, or benzylparaben, are widely
used preservatives found in products from deodorant to mas-
cara. Some research suggests a possible link to sperm defor-
mity and breast-cancer activity in laboratory tests.
 Diethanolamine (DEA), common in sunscreens and moisturiz-
ers, and used as a foaming agent or emulsifier, has shown evi-
dence as a hormone disruptor and as a suspected carcinogen.
 Fragrance is a catchall that may indicate phthalates, which
may be linked to endocrine disruptive activity.
Although none of these ingredients have been found by the Food
and Drug Administration to be in quantities or forms dangerous to
human safety “at the present time,” the Web site (www.fda.gov)
indicates that research is ongoing and the agency will advise the
public as it discovers new findings. (In fact, in 2008, Congress over-
whelmingly passed the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
ban on some phthalates from children’s toys, pending further
research.)

Making scents
When you eliminate harsh chemical cleaners from your arsenal, you also get rid of
some of those acrid, nostril-burning smells that linger and signal clean. Gentler prod-
ucts may leave less of a scent, which is great because you can then choose how
to scent your bathroom, if at all. The air-freshener recipe in Chapter 6 works to kill
other odors rather than adding its own. You can also add a few drops of your favorite
essential oil: peppermint, citrus, or rose.
The prospect of a long bubble bath surrounded by candles is enough to knead out
tensions as effective as a meditation session. Most candles, however, are made
from paraffin, a petroleum-based wax. Many also include lead wick holders. Choose
candles made of beeswax, soy, or palm oil for a more Earth-friendly experience.
They do cost a bit more.

You practically have to be a chemist to understand what to look
for when choosing personal-care products. For information about
safe ingredients and specific product information, visit the Environ-
mental Working Group Skin Deep Web site at www.cosmetics
database.com. When shopping for cosmetics and toiletries, look
for the following:
 An ingredients list that you can understand, with a minimum
of multisyllabic, untranslatable terms
 Products that are not tested on animals
 Certified organic products, which must contain at least 70 per-
cent certified organic ingredients from natural sources such
as nuts, flowers, and fruits
Seeking responsible 
personal products
Safety is one concern when choosing personal care products;
being a responsible Earth citizen is another. Here are some steps
you can take to reduce the environmental impact your purchases
make on the planet:
 Choose products that have the least packaging or contain
post-consumer recycled — and recyclable — packaging.
 Select cotton swabs made of paper and cotton rather than
plastic.
 Consider an electric shaver over disposable blades or buy a
razor with replaceable blades so that you’re not disposing of
as much plastic.
 Seek products that don’t use petroleum-based ingredients.
 Find resources in your area where some toiletries, such as
shampoo and liquid soap, are sold in bulk. You bring in refill-
able pump bottles and containers and purchase by the ounce.
Speed Cleaning: What You Can 
Do in Less Than 15 Minutes
When I get a last-minute call that company is on the way over, the
first room I head for is the bathroom. Like most people, I’d be mor-
tified to have a guest walk into a room with toothpaste on the sink,
Chapter 8: Coming Clean in the Bathroom 143

wet towels tangled on the bar, toilet paper down to a mere square,
and the toilet bowl in need of a scrub. (Not that I’m saying that
would ever happen at my house!)
When the clock is ticking, here’s what you can do in less than 
15 minutes to get your bathroom ready for guests:
 Put in the toilet bowl cleaner so it’s working while you tackle
other tasks.
 Polish the sink and faucet.
 Wipe down the toilet, including the seat (up and down), with
an all-purpose cleaner. (Check Chapter 6 for recipes.)
 Polish the mirror with a squirt of vinegar-and-water solution.
 Swish the toilet with the brush, shut the lid, and flush.
 Replenish toilet paper, soap, and towels.
 Wipe out the tub/shower — or close the shower curtain if
you’re in a big hurry.
 Adjust blinds or window treatments.
 Spot-clean the floor. (Don’t forget to scoop up the dirty 
cleaning cloths and drop them in the laundry room.)

Laundry Room

T
he laundry room isn’t just another space to keep clean: It’s a
place whose raison d’etre is to clean. Here, your family delivers
its dirty clothes, worn sheets, damp towels, smelly socks, and
other items you don’t even want to touch — and through the mira-
cles of modern machinery, they’re delivered clean, bright, fresh-
smelling, and ready to be worn and used again.
This transformation doesn’t occur with the press of a button. A lot
of resources go into turning dirty laundry into once-again presenta-
ble apparel. In fact, the laundry room sees some of the most
energy-intensive action in the household. According to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, the washer and dryer together
contribute 10 percent to your utility bill, and the water heater adds
11 percent on top of that total. The washer is the biggest drain on
your home’s hot water.
Because laundry-room activity consumes so much energy and
water, the green changes you make to your clothes-cleaning prac-
tices are sure to have a positive impact on lightening your house-
hold’s carbon footprint.

When Green Washing Is Good
It’s hard to imagine a greater boon to the modern homemaker than
the washing machine. When your great-great-grandmothers did the
laundry, they may have used a big black cauldron containing as
much as 50 gallons of water. Although you probably haven’t had to
haul the water yourself, until recently, washing machines still used
as many as 30 to 40 gallons of water per load. And, of course, the
modern process requires electricity.
Fortunately, technology keeps improving the washing machine’s
energy efficiency. In addition to building a better machine, you can
make other changes to your laundry practices to reduce the
energy required.
Trading in for a younger model
Appliances that use lots of water tend to need replacement earlier
than other machines, such as dryers and ovens. Thus, the govern-
ment’s Energy Star Web site (www.energystar.gov) gives the
average clothes washer a life span of 11 years. (Why, you ask, can’t
they manufacture a machine that can last a generation? Don’t get
me started on the topic of planned obsolescence.)
The most energy-efficient models work without the tub-and-
agitator construction of the traditional clothes washer, in which
clothes are completely submerged in water and a central agitator
moves the laundry back and forth to loosen the dirt.
The new high-efficiency (HE) models, both top-load and front-load
versions (see Figure 9-1), work without an agitator, instead using a
tumbling or flipping effect and cleaning with high-pressure spray.
Additionally, the new machines have a high-speed spin feature,
which means more moisture is squeezed out of garments so that
they spend less time in the dryer or on the line.
HE washing machines, especially the front-load models, currently
cost more than standard models. But they bring with them many
benefits, some which translate into dollar savings:
 Less energy used (20 to 60 percent)
 Less water used (as much as 7,000 gallons a year, 20 to 50 
percent)
 Cleaner clothing, according to many homeowners
 A gentler action, which increases the life of clothing and other
washables
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
146

Figure 9-1: The traditional agitator washing machine (far left) is not as energy-
efficient as the newer tumble-action models, whether front-load or top-load.
In some cities and counties, homeowners are eligible to earn incen-
tives or to receive rebates when they install an energy-efficient
washing machine. Contact your local utilities companies.
When shopping for a new clothes washer, look for the Energy Star
EnergyGuide label, a big yellow-and-black tag that identifies how
much energy is required to run the machine and how that com-
pares to the average. Additionally, visit the Energy Star Web site
(www.energystar.gov) to view a specific model’s Modified Energy
Factor (MEF) and Water Factor (WF). The higher the MEF and the
lower the WF, the better the washer is for energy conservation.
Cooling down energy consumption
Sure, the washing machine uses electricity (or gas) to operate, but
the biggest energy bite comes from the water required to clean
each load of wash: The hotter the water, the bigger the bite.
About 90 percent of the energy used to wash your clothes comes
from heating the water. Switch from hot water to warm water, and
you reduce the energy consumed for washing clothes by half;
adjust from hot to cold and lower it even further.
In most cases, cold or warm water is adequate for getting your
laundry clean, especially when using the newer high-efficiency
washers. But washing in cold water has benefits beyond reducing
your energy use:
 Fabric lasts longer
 Fabric has less wrinkling
 Fabric has less shrinkage
 Fabric has less fading
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 147

Although many sources suggest that towels, sheets, and undergar-
ments get just as clean in cold water, you may be a bit squeamish
about this thought. If you have a HE washer and use a made-for-
cold detergent, you should be able to get most items clean and
fresh. Add a quarter-cup of white distilled vinegar to the wash,
which softens and disinfects. Otherwise, you may want to compro-
mise with the occasional hot-water load.
In some cases, however, hot water is necessary for the best clean-
ing job. Consider cranking up the temp under these circumstances:
 Mildewed towels or clothing
 Sheets and bedding for those who suffer from dust mite allergies
 All clothing, bedding, or any other fabric when someone in
the household has been found to have head lice (not uncom-
mon in elementary school children)
 Clothing, sheets, or towels used by someone who may have a
contagious illness
Some sources advise that water be as high as 130°F to kill certain
bacteria and eliminate problems such as head lice, so if you keep
your water heater at 120°F or lower — as recommended for reduc-
ing energy use — you may have to crank it up temporarily. Follow
the directions on the head lice shampoo bottle.
Making the most of each load
Whether you’re using cold, warm, or hot water or a new front-load
or old agitator model, you can take steps to maximize the use of
your clothes washer, load by load:
 Follow the manufacturer’s instructions when washing clothes.
 Always run full loads — the machine uses nearly as much
energy whether you’re washing a small, medium, or large load.
 Don’t overload the machine, or clothes won’t get clean.
 Use your washer’s most energy-efficient settings: Skip the san-
itizing cycle, says Energy Star, and use the high-spin cycle to
remove the most water before you dry.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
148

Setting the Dryer on 
High-Efficiency
Although your dryer can use more energy than your washer, Energy
Star doesn’t yet rate dryers, nor does the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) demand an EnergyGuide label on dryers. The fact is, dryers
don’t vary much from one to the next in terms of energy usage.
What’s more important, then, is how you use your dryer.
Replacing your dryer
According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy (ACEEE), replacing your dryer before its natural life is
over (12 to 13 years) makes little environmental sense. But when
the time comes, look for the following features when shopping for
your next dryer:
 Choose a dryer with a moisture sensor so that your dryer
turns off automatically when fabrics are dry.
 Look for an air-dry feature, which spins the clothing without
hot air, and is great for nearly dry or drip-dry materials that
suffer from too much heat.
 Select quiet machines, which are usually better insulated.
That means the dryer drum stays warmer longer, which adds
up to greater energy efficiency.
 Although the difference isn’t huge, some sources suggest that
gas dryers are slightly more efficient to run than electric
dryers.
Maximizing dryer use
To make your dryer perform most efficiently, take steps before you
pop the clothes in the machine: Use the highest spin cycle on your
clothes washer to ring out every last drop of water first. Then
follow these tips for quick and minimal use of your dryer:
 Sort loads, separating quick-drying garments from heavy 
articles.
 Reduce static by separating natural materials from synthetics
and drying in separate loads.
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 149

 If you have a moisture-sensing option, use it. Let the dryer —
not the timer — determine when the clothes are dry.
 Check the drum for clinging socks or lint.
 Always run a full load to save energy.
 Clean the lint trap every time you dry. Letting lint build up
makes your machine work twice as hard, drying more slowly
and burning up more energy.
 Clean the dryer vent of lint buildup at least once a year, more
frequently if you find your machine takes longer than normal
to dry clothes.
An overfilled lint trap or dryer vent can be a fire hazard. According
to Consumer Reports, nearly a third of the more than 13,000 home
fires a year that start in the laundry room are caused by overfull
lint traps or clogged dryer vents.
Giving Your Appliances a Break
When you replace your old-dinosaur washer and dryer with the
most efficient models on the market and maintain them well, you
can see your energy use drop. But the most effective way to cut
down on their energy consumption? Use your washer and dryer
less often.
Hand-washing small loads
When a friend turned down her water heater to 117°F and swore off
hot-water loads, she continued to cringe at washing certain items
of clothing in cold or even warm water. Socks, undies, cleaning
rags given the dirtiest of duties — these items just seemed to
require temperatures a little more torrid than tepid.
So she fills a bucket or the laundry sink with steam-emitting hot
water and soap, scrubs the clothing by hand, and lets the items
soak. This practice keeps her hot-water use under control, but
gives her the peace of mind that the grimiest, germiest articles get
a high-powered cleaning.
Hand-washing is a practical option for lingerie and other garments
too delicate for the agitator or even the gentler front-load tumbler.
But for any less-than-full-load-sized piles of dirty laundry, a scrub in
the laundry tub can be an easy cleaning option that saves the wear
and tear on your washer and cuts down on water and electricity.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
150

If you like scent, add a couple of drops of essential oils to hand-
washables. Lavender is a favorite, said to induce a state of relax-
ation. Citrus or peppermint offers a fresh, “wake-up” aroma.
Wearing it more than once
Adherents to the wear-it-once school of fashion assume that a single
wearing can dirty or soil an item so badly, it must be washed again.
Sometimes that’s true, but as long as you’re not sweating profusely,
or rolling around in the mud regularly, many outer garments —
sweaters, jackets, even casual pants — can be worn two, three, or
more times before they need cleaning.
If you’re concerned that your pre-worn clothing smells “stale” or
looks worn, try these tips to freshen up your apparel without dedi-
cating yet another wash cycle to getting it clean:
 Air it out. Hang your clothing on a hanger in a room with
good circulation. Better yet, weather permitting, let it hang
outside in the sun for a bit. Turn items inside-out to avoid
fading and to expose the underside to the disinfecting powers
of the sun.
 Give it a rest. When you let your garments breathe between
wearings, you can often wear them more times without feeling
like a walking laundry hamper. If you allow the jeans you wore
on day one to air out on day two, they’ll seem “cleaner” when
you wear them again on day three.
 Brush it off. If you see lint, cat hair, grit, or other stuff collect-
ing visibly on the material, take a clothes or a lint brush to the
item.
 Spot-clean stains. The sooner you catch stains, the better.
Sometimes all it takes is a dab of cold water to get out a bit of
dirt. (See the “Removing stains” section, later in this chapter,
for more information.)
 Hang it back up. Remind the kids to hang up their bath
towels so that they can use them again. Even environmentally
conscious lodgings are encouraging reuse of towels when
you’re staying multiple nights, cutting their labor, energy, and
water costs, as well. Whether at home or elsewhere, hanging
up towels is an eco-wise practice.
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 151

Line-drying, inside and out
I praise the virtues of sun-drying your laundry in Chapter 6. Not
only does sun-drying cut down on your energy use, the disinfec-
tant properties of sunshine help kill bacteria as clothing and bed-
ding dry, aided by gentle breezes.
Line-drying your clothes outside can be as simple as stretching a
clothesline (found in most grocery and hardware stores) from one
tree to another or as complicated as a kit that includes zinc pul-
leys, hooks, a clothesline wire, a line tightener, and a line divider.
With this technology, you can stand in one place and pull the line
to you to hang up or remove clothes.
You can also install a fold-up pole dryer in your backyard. This
contraption usually has an aluminum center pole with folding
umbrella-type steel-coated arms that accommodate two to three
loads of wash. The arms rotate, and you can place unmentionables
so that they’re not visible to people on the street or the neighbors.
Also, when the arms are down, the pole itself is fairly unobtrusive
in the landscape.
Whether line, pole, or full kit system, all you need is a rain-free day
and a bag of clothespins to harness this kind of solar power.
If you or someone else in your household suffers from allergies,
hanging bed sheets and towels on the line during pollen season
isn’t a good idea.
“Not in my neighborhood”
Your homeowner association may pose a roadblock to line-drying,
forbidding the “unsightly” practice of airing your dirty laundry in
public, even if it’s in your own backyard.
In a pricey neighborhood filled with multi-story, Tuscan-style man-
sions, the residents took offense when a family hung their laundry
out. Complainants took their beef to the neighborhood association,
which eventually ruled that the family could continue to hang their
laundry in the backyard — as long as their underthings weren’t vis-
ible to other neighbors.
Do check with your neighborhood covenants before you hang out
your wash. And if you discover it’s a prohibited practice, get
involved and see whether you can persuade your neighbors to
overturn this Earth-unfriendly restriction. Covenants may limit the
time of day or days of the week or whether the pole or line has to
be behind a tall fence.

Weathering hard-to-dry conditions
I lived in Trinidad and Tobago for several months and washed my
clothes in a bucket with soap and water and hung them on the line.
Because of the strong sun and dry winds, clothes dried in an hour
or two. The clothesline continued under a roofed portion, so when
the rains came, laundry was quickly moved under protective cover.
Conditions aren’t always so amenable to outdoor drying, and some
clothes don’t do as well when hung out to dry. Follow these sug-
gestions to make the most of your indoor and outdoor space:
 For towels, bathrobes, and other heavy materials that take a
long time to dry — or dry stiff and rough — hang them on the
line until partially dry and then finish up with a brief spin in
the dryer.
 Knits and sweaters tend to stretch when hung on a line. Better
to lay them flat to retain their shape. You can set up a mesh
dryer rack so that air circulates around the fabric.
 When weather permits, hang up damp dish towels, wash-
cloths, hand towels, and bath towels and let them dry in the
sun. Then replace them on your towel bars to be reused.
 Hang it up inside. If you live in a wet, humid, or perpetually
gray place, you can dry wet clothes in well-circulated rooms.
Install a retractable clothesline in your laundry room or get a
drying rack.
 At your home, use a rack placed in the bathtub to stretch out
sweaters and items that need to be dried flat. To control inside
humidity, you may want to put a fan in your drying area.
Making Sense of Laundry Products
Wander the housekeeping aisle of any grocery store and prepare to
be overwhelmed by options for cleaning your clothes. Liquids and
powders; gentle cleaners; detergents with bleach; formulas for
colors; cleaners that turn clothing whiter; cold-water soaps; prod-
ucts that make your laundry smell like spring or flowers. Who
knew doing the laundry could be so complicated?
It doesn’t have to be. Basically, you clean your clothes with the
same stuff you use to clean everything else: soap or detergent.
There is a difference between the two — they’re not the same
thing. I’ll skip the chemistry lesson, but in a nutshell, soap is most
often derived from plants, oils, ash, and other natural ingredients,
and detergents are commonly made of synthetic surfactants, based
on — you guessed it — petroleum-based compounds.
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 153

Both are effective cleaners, but when it comes to washing clothes,
the popular choice has been detergent. Soaps, many complain,
leave a film on fabric that turns the material dull and gray.
Saying no to conventional products
Conventional laundry detergents are made from synthetic petro-
chemicals, which give the environment a beating. Some detergents
leave residues that irritate the skin and dull fabrics. If you’re sensi-
tive, you may develop a rash or find the barrage of sweet perfumes
dizzying.
But that’s not all: Many detergents contain bleach from chlorine,
which has been identified as a known carcinogen by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The Clean Air Act also lists it as
a hazardous air pollutant (see Chapter 3).
In my mom’s retirement community, all newcomers are advised in
no uncertain terms that “no chlorine bleach is allowed in any form
in this building.” That’s good advice no matter your age.
Zeroing in on green alternatives
You can make your own laundry detergent — in fact, this book con-
tains recipes in Chapter 6.
Frankly, I do a lot of laundry and don’t have the time or the
patience to experiment or to mix homemade laundry detergent
when so many commercially available green detergents work very
well. I recommend letting someone else do the blending and stir-
ring to produce a hard-working product. See the Appendix for a list
of products to consider.
Ecofriendly laundry detergents substitute plant-based oils for the
nonrenewable, petroleum-based components. They typically are
free of heavy perfumes, though many are scented with essential
oils such as lavender and orange. And they also omit dyes and
optical brighteners — for those who prefer their clothes to be truly
clean rather than coated with something that makes the material
look whiter. (You want clothes to be clean, not glow in the dark like
George Hamilton’s teeth.)
Many consumers say that plant-based cleaners often don’t seem 
to do as good a job getting clothes really, really clean. Adding a
laundry booster can give your cleaner the edge: Two boosters are
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
154

washing soda and borax. (See Chapter 6 for more about these
mainstay ingredients of the green cleaning cupboard.) Add a half-
cup along with your laundry detergent at the beginning of the wash
cycle. Or use as a pre-soak — two tablespoons in a gallon of water
ought to loosen up the toughest stains in 30 minutes.
The newest high-efficiency (HE) washers require low-sudsing
detergents, and the green aisle offers a selection of these. HE
machines also take much less soap than the traditional top-loading
agitator models. So go easy on the amount. Follow instructions to
avoid suds overflow.
Getting soft on laundry
Fabric softeners reduce friction and static electricity (what makes
socks cling together — and not necessarily in matching pairs).
They give material a soft, fluffy feel and often provide a sweet or
fresh smell.
These formulas don’t, however, aid the cleaning process in any
way. The conventional brands typically contain petrochemicals
and ingredients such as artificial fragrance that have been linked
to air, water, and health concerns. Moreover, liquid softeners and
dryer sheets can cause skin rashes and asthmatic reactions. (Read
more in Chapter 3.)
Even the green softeners may be considered a waste of resources,
what with the manufacturing, packaging, and shipping required.
But if you love the effect of fabric softener, it’s your decision; just
choose wisely and use sparingly.
And don’t think you’re safe with dryer balls, either. Although
advertised as environmentally friendly, the spiky, rubbery devices
you throw in the dryer to “naturally” soften your clothes are made
of polyvinyl chloride (yes, PVC), which may result in the release of
carcinogenic substances.
For a similar anti-static, softening result, try one of these ingredi-
ents in the rinse cycle:
 1⁄2 cup of baking soda
 1⁄4 cup of borax
 1⁄4 cup white distilled vinegar
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 155

Material Matters
Your clothing plays a part in your energy-consumption habits.
Factors such as material, color, and quality all determine how often
an item should be washed — and how. Understanding fabric and
its care is an important step in making choices that reduce your
laundry energy load.
Choosing wear-friendly fabrics
Use less energy by buying well-made clothing and linens that last
longer, thus conserving resources in the manufacture of poorly
made, throwaway clothes. An article of apparel that can stand up
to soil and wear, as well as to the cleaning process, can also mean
fewer washings and lower energy costs.
Checking out the care label of a garment before you buy can help
you select responsibly for minimizing the energy demands for
cleaning and maintaining your clothing. Figure 9-2 indicates the var-
ious care symbols established by the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) and found on the tags of most clothing.
In addition to making a fashion statement, the clothing, bedding,
and linens you select make an environmental — even political —
statement. The label not only identifies the designer and provides
care instructions, it also tells you
 Where the clothes were made. The closer to home the ori-
gins are, the smaller the CO2 footprint. (See Chapter 2 for a
further explanation of CO2 and its role in greenhouse gas 
emissions and climate change.)
 How the clothes were made. Fair Trade certification identi-
fies that clothing has been manufactured in environments that
pay fair wages and offer safe conditions for workers, among
other aspirations. Few clothing labels carry the Fair Trade
logo.
 Whether the fabric is made of materials that have been
organically produced. Cotton is the most common fiber to be
grown organically, but hemp, linen, soy, silk, and wool can
also be organic. Conventional cotton, for example, is grown in
a wash of petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides.
 How the material was processed. Bleaches and dyes with
toxic characteristics are commonly used in the manufacture
of sheets, towels, and fabric. Both can cause negative health
symptoms and are bad for the planet.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
156

Figure 9-2: The ASTM Guide to Care symbols.
 Whether the garment is made of recycled materials.
Synthetics, such as polyester, used to be a joke, particularly
from a green perspective, as they’re commonly derived from
nonrenewable petroleum. But some new synthetics are made
from recycled materials: Hard to imagine that your new jacket
contains recycled soda bottles.
Preparing clothes for the wash
Wouldn’t it be great if you could just indiscriminately throw all
your dirty laundry into the wash without worrying about fading,

shrinking, or bleeding? But unless you’re prepared to present your
household with all-pink underwear, sorting is a necessity.
Pre-sorting the laundry is also a great tactic for cleaning most effi-
ciently. By dividing your clothing into like loads, you’re more likely
to wash in a way that requires less energy and less water and main-
tain your garments so that they last longer.
Of course, if you’ve switched over to cold-water wash, you’ve
already reduced the risk of making colors run, fabrics shrink and
wrinkle, and material wear faster.
Still, follow these tips to ensure the best results when you do your
laundry:
 Sort laundry by color, separating whites and light colors from
garments with intense color.
 Separate items that are stained or heavily soiled or require
special pretreatment.
 Pull out clothing that must be hand-washed.
 Placing delicates in a mesh bag is one way to avoid hand-
washing. In the bag, they’re less likely to snag during the cycle.
 Check the label for each article: Even in a load of reds, you
may want to treat an item likely to bleed separately.
Imported fabrics and madras can bleed for many, many loads,
so don’t assume that if it’s been washed before, it won’t bleed
again.
 If you’re washing a load in warm or hot water, double-check
the labels to be sure that nothing in that batch can shrink 
or bleed.
 Turn dark-colored clothing, such as jeans and cotton T-shirts,
inside out before washing to reduce fading.
 Check pockets before throwing garments in the wash. Those
used tissues wreak enough havoc, but heaven forbid that a
lipstick or a permanent marker gets by, permanently marking
your favorite white shirt.
 Fasten Velcro openings, clasp hook-and-eye fasteners, and zip
zippers to prevent snagging and snarling with other garments.
Removing stains
Blood, grass, grease, lipstick. When you discover these stains on
your garments, you know a regular wash, whether you clean it in

cold or hot water, won’t do the trick. You’ve got to take decisive
steps and focus on the stain if you’re going to get it out with no
telltale signs.
Conventional spot removers are good at getting out some of these
more challenging stains, but they often contain nasty solvent 
ingredients — the kinds that do unfriendly things to your air 
passages and put groundwater at risk.
You can find Earth-friendly spot removers on the shelves of big box
stores and even conventional supermarkets. Or you can make your
own by pulling these stain-zapping ingredients right off your shelf
or out of your refrigerator:
 Baking soda
 Borax
 Club soda
 Lemon juice
 Liquid dishwashing soap
 Liquid laundry detergent
 Salt
 White distilled vinegar
The best course of action when discovering a stain is to take care
of it immediately. Water is always your first and best defense.
When in doubt, always use cold water rather than warm water.
Many stains, such as blood and tomato, are protein-based, and hot
water can set the stain. If a bit of plain cold water doesn’t do the
trick, try the solutions in Table 9-1.
Table 9-1
Solutions for Specific Stains
Stain
Solution
Berries
Soak the spot with cold water and then let it soak in
lemon juice for 20 minutes. Rinse with cold water and
launder as usual.
Blood
Wash stain with cold water. If that doesn’t do it, use a
little baking soda, liquid soap, salt, or other alkaline-
based agent.
Chocolate
Soak fabric in cold water. If that doesn’t work, dab with
liquid laundry detergent.

Table 9-1 (continued)
Stain
Solution
Coffee
Rinse with warm water and then soak in a mixture of
half borax and half water. When the stain is gone, rinse
with warm water and air dry. 
Fruit juice
For a substantial stain, pour boiling water on sturdy
fabrics, warm water on delicates. For a light drop or
two of juice, a quick once-over with cold water should
do the trick. Grape juice may take more effort than
lemonade. 
Grass
Bring on the liquid dish soap and warm water and then
rinse with clear water. For more stubborn stains, try
white distilled vinegar or cream of tartar.
Ink
A little dishwashing liquid and water may remove a
small stain. For more stubborn spots, try white distilled
vinegar. A little white wine or vodka may lift the spot
out, too.
Lipstick
Put stained garment or linen on an old white towel and
soak with a solution of water and dishwashing deter-
gent. Blot to remove the stain. The lipstick should seep
under onto the towel. Follow by laundering. Baking
soda and water may work as well. 
Perspiration
Make a solution of 4 tablespoons of salt in 1 quart of
hot water. Sponge the area with this mixture, rinse
well, and launder as usual. 
Red wine
Gently dab the spot with club soda until the stain is
removed. Follow by laundering. 
Sunscreen
Remove any remaining lotion, then sprinkle with baking
soda, and allow to sit for an hour or two. Shake off the
residue and sponge with a small amount of dishwash-
ing liquid and warm water. Launder as usual. 
Tomato-based 
Rinse immediately with cold water and then rub on
foods, such as 
liquid dishwashing or laundry detergent. Let it set for a 
pasta sauce 
few minutes and rinse again with cold water. If the stain 
or ketchup
remains, try laundering with a cup of white distilled
vinegar in the wash, followed by a cool-water rinse. 
Urine
Soak in 1/4 cup white vinegar in a quart of water,
remove, and launder as usual. Works for human and
pet urine. 
Yellowing
Prescrub with a mild liquid detergent. Then wash as
usual in the washing machine.

Some solutions can weaken certain material fibers: Cotton, for
example, doesn’t take too well to acidic bases, such as vinegar or
lemon juice. Always read the care instructions on the inside 
of a garment before treating with any stain remover. Once stains
have become set in the dryer, it may be near impossible to 
remove them. Fresh stains are easier to remove than stains that
have dried.
Ironing Out the Wrinkles
With permanent-press materials, dry-cleaners, and shirt-cleaning
services, ironing has become something of a lost art. But if, as 
part of your environmental efforts, you’re eschewing synthetic
materials for 100-percent organic naturals such as cotton and
linen, you may be re-discovering the “joys” of ironing as wrinkles
re-enter your wardrobe once again. (I know an accountant who
irons his dress shirts for the week while watching weekend 
afternoon televised football games. He says he finds it relaxing.)
Ironing requires the use of an electric appliance. Although it 
doesn’t consume as much energy as, say, the dryer, still, it adds
slightly to your utility bill. And some irons and ironing boards are
coated with a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),
which is a suspected carcinogen.
The first step to reducing the need for ironing is to prevent 
wrinkling in the first place:
 Don’t overfill the washer or dryer.
 Use cooler water to wash.
 Take clothes out of the dryer immediately.
 Don’t over-dry.
But when that lightweight linen suit needs some “crisping up”
before a summer event, it’s time for the ironing board to come out
of the utility closet. To make the time pass easily and smoothly,
follow these tips:
 Seek a heavier-weight iron for less pressing on your part. Look
at the soleplate (the flat base that makes contact with your
clothing); a larger one means fewer strokes.
 Steam is a clean way to iron. Look for a good steam feature
that provides an even mist. Some prefer dry irons to 
avoid drip stains when pressing starched clothes or for 
quilting projects.
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 161

 Choose an iron with an automatic shut-off and other safety
features to prevent fires or burns.
 Make sure the soleplate is clean before using so that the iron
glides. On a cool iron, clean the soleplate with a paste of
baking soda and water applied with a cloth or old toothbrush.
Wipe clean after it dries to remove buildup.
 An ironing board should be sturdy with a well padded,
smooth, and secure cotton elasticized cover. Boards can be
portable or attached permanently to the wall, hidden in 
a cabinet, or held up by hooks in the laundry room.
 Avoid commercial starch or ironing sprays, with petroleum-
based synthetic starching chemicals. Make your own with a
cup of water and a tablespoon of cornstarch in a non-aerosol
spray bottle.
Never leave a hot iron unattended — especially around children 
or pets — even if it has an automatic shutoff. An iron can stay 
blistering-hot for quite some time.
Getting Taken at the Cleaners
Seems almost anyone who dresses for the office ends up with a
closet full of outfits that read “Dry Clean Only” on the clothing 
tag. First of all, dry cleaning’s not cheap — but worse is the 
environmental cost.
Alternatives to perc
The traditional dry-cleaning process, still used by some 85 percent
of all dry cleaners in the United States, involves a chemical called
perchloroethylene, commonly referred to as perc.
This solution is known to cause dizziness and headaches and is
suspected of causing other more serious problems, including 
central nervous system disorders. The International Agency for
Research on Cancer has identified perc as a probable human 
carcinogen. On the orders of the Environmental Protection Agency,
any dry cleaner in a residential building must phase out perc by
the year 2020. And the state of California is poised to phase out use
of perc by all dry cleaners.
Alternatives are few, but springing up around the country are more
cleaning services offering a wet cleaning process, which uses water
and nontoxic detergents. Other dry-cleaning options are liquid
carbon dioxide (CO2) and liquid silicon-based solvents that claim
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
162

to be less harmful to the environment or humans. These claims are
contested, however, and neither the EPA nor the Coalition for
Clean Air have given them the green light as far as human or envi-
ronmental health goes.
As the perils of perc become more known and consumers continue
to demand safer choices, you can hope to see more wet cleaners
and more green alternatives.
If you find that you must continue to dry clean some clothing the
conventional way, always take the garments out of the plastic 
bag outside the house and let them air out before wearing. The 
lingering fumes of perc can irritate your skin and cause breathing
problems.
Do-it-yourself dry cleaning
A dry cleaner may not be necessary at all. Even if your label says
Dry Clean Only, take a look at the material content and determine
whether you can clean it yourself.
An acquaintance, in the process of purging her closet of two
decades worth of corporate suits, decided to experiment with the
Dry Clean Only garments she planned to give away. She washed
each one based on fabric content. Of some dozen or more wool,
silk, polyester, rayon, and acetate garments, only one outfit —
made of acetate — ended up worse for the experience.
The key to most clothing that says Dry Clean Only is to wash it in
cool or tepid water and avoid agitation. Fabrics such as wool and
silk are damaged because they’re twisted, squeezed, tossed, and
spun, not because they’re washed in water.
Things can get complicated a bit when, say, you have a silk suit —
which washes well in a warm wash and a mild soap — with an
acetate lining, which requires cool water but takes a more alkaline
cleaning agent. Proceed with caution when taking the cleaning of
such garments into your own hands, perhaps testing a hidden spot
on a hem or inside lining.
Keeping a Clean Laundry Room
It’s not hard to keep the laundry room clean — what with minimal
furnishings and behemoth appliances that require little more 
than an occasional wipe-down. What’s challenging is keeping 
the laundry room from becoming your catchall space, where 
everything that doesn’t have a place ends up.
Chapter 9: Airing the Dirty Laundry Room 163

Maintaining order
The laundry room also supports auxiliary cleaning activity. Often
located just off the garage or at a side entrance, this space may
serve double-duty as the mud room. It may be the preferred spot
for conducting craft projects. Pet food stations and cat litter boxes
are often relegated to the laundry room precisely because it serves
as Cleanup Central. And, typically, the laundry area is where all the
other cleaning supplies and tools are stored.
Letting your laundry room serve multiple purposes makes a lot of
sense, but keep the space well-organized and picked up. Store
materials in closets, drawers, shelves, or cubbies to maintain order
and sanity.
Cleaning up the cleanup area
The materials and furnishings in the laundry area are typically
easy to clean: With the laundry sink within easy reach, it’s a breeze
to fill up a bucket of soapy water and wipe down the floors, the
walls, the shelves, and the appliances. The basic recipes in this
book (see Chapter 6) should take care of all cleaning needs in the
laundry room.
In addition to the usual surfaces, don’t forget to maintain these
tricky spots, as well:
 Clean out gunky buildup in your washer’s detergent or 
softener dispenser.
 Move the machines occasionally to vacuum up dust and 
collect the orphan socks, spare change, and other stuff that
drops out of the folds of laundry.
 If the laundry room is pet headquarters, place food and water
bowls on a rubber mat and sweep up any kibble that finds its
way to the floor.
 Provide rubber mats for boots and shoes, too, to reduce the
trail of mud and dirt through the house.
 Vacuum the laundry room frequently, as dust and lint tend to
collect there more than in other rooms. Use the crevice tool
(long and thin) to reach into narrow spaces and corners.

W
hen you consider that you log an average of one-third of
your 24-hour day there, the humble bedroom rises in
importance. Often overlooked in terms of cleaning and decor —
after all, unlike the kitchen, living room, and even guest bathroom,
it’s rarely seen by company — your bedroom nonetheless plays a
starring role in your health and well-being. The place that restores,
revitalizes, and refreshes must serve as a sublime sanctuary for
rest and sleep.
In this chapter, I explore the best cleaning strategies that keep dirt,
dust, and irritants out of your bedroom. I also show you how to
arrange and furnish your room for maximum effect. The furniture
and bedding options add to — or detract from — the room’s health
factor. While some changes, such as putting down a new floor or
replacing windows, involve remodeling, I also offer suggestions for
immediate steps you can take to improve your sleep environment.
Ensuring a Degree of Comfort
In pre-central-air days, folks set up their sleeping quarters so that
windows welcomed in breezes and high ceilings allowed hot air to

collect away from sleepers. When the temperatures climbed to
sweltering, sleeping porches drew the inhabitants to bunk down in
the coolest place in the house.
With the advent of air conditioning, those who live in warm-
weather regions no longer have to suffer through sticky-hot 
nights. But the concerned citizen who wants to minimize energy
use can prepare the bedroom to be a more comfortable and
energy-efficient place to dream away a midsummer night.
Good air circulation in your home’s bedrooms helps manage 
comfort in warm weather, reducing the need for the air 
conditioner. People sleep best when the room temperature is
between 55° and 68°F. Cross-ventilation also reduces humidity, 
discourages mildew, and brings in clean, fresh air.
To encourage good air flow and reduce energy-guzzling air 
conditioning and heating, follow these suggestions:
 Install windows that you can open to let in breezes. The only
caution here is to close them at night for safety reasons,
depending on where you live.
 Use floor fans or ceiling fans, which take less energy to run
than air conditioning.
 Hang blinds, curtains, or window treatments that you can
open to take advantage of sunshine and breezes and that you
can tightly close to provide insulation and privacy when
needed.
 To reduce solar gain (when the sun heats up the interior 
of your home through your windows, making your air 
conditioner work harder), plant deciduous trees so that they
shade your windows.
 Arrange your bedroom furniture so that the bed is positioned
in the cross-breeze from the window to the door.
 Adjust your bedding instead of the thermostat: heavier 
blankets in the winter, light coverings in the summer.
Keeping Allergens Out 
of the Bedroom
The average American home can be plagued with substances that
make the inhabitants ill, aggravate certain conditions, and cause
uncomfortable symptoms. But when ensuring a clean and serene
sleep space, some of these irritants are particularly annoying —
and I’m not talking about your spouse or kids.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
166

The dirty truth about dust mites
Among the most unwelcome of these irritants are dust mites.
These microscopic members of the spider family thrive in 
warm, moist environments. They feed on dead skin cells from
humans and pets. It’s the dust mite droppings — not the mites
themselves — that provoke allergic reactions from 10 to 15 
percent of the population. Symptoms range from headaches and
burning eyes to chronic sinusitis and asthma attacks.
These miniscule villains cluster by the millions in places such as
mattresses, sheets, blankets, carpeting, and window coverings.
Your pillow, which comes into intimate contact with your head, is 
a favorite gathering place. And — how’s this for disgusting? — up
to 10 percent of the weight of a two-year-old pillow is made up of
dust mites and their droppings.
Eradicating dust mites from your home is virtually impossible, 
but you can drastically reduce their numbers and alleviate 
allergy suffering by taking decisive cleaning action, including 
these practices:
Chapter 10: Creating a Clean and Healthful Sleeping Environment 167
Setting the stage for a good night’s sleep
More so than any other room in the home, your bedroom is your sanctuary, your
retreat, your escape from the stresses and pressures of the world. As such, you
want to be judicious about what you bring into this most intimate of spaces — and
what you leave out. Some changes to consider include the following:
 Decorate your bedroom in soothing colors.
 Leave the TV off. Many reports connect watching TV in bed to insomnia.
 Keep clock-radios and electronic devices as far away from your bed as possi-
ble. Although studies are controversial, some research indicates a link between
electromagnetic field radio waves and brain cancer. As one doctor noted, the
results may not be universally accepted, but if you can avoid the risk, why not?
In addition, the light from the clocks may disturb your sleep.
 Keep the clutter out. Don’t let projects, work, reading, unfolded laundry, junk
mail, or other piles of distraction find their way into your bedroom. Maintain a
serene haven of tranquility.
 If you live in an urban environment or have an unusual work schedule, choose
window treatments, such as special room-darkening shades, to block out light.
Heavy window coverings also muffle sound — and improve insulation.
 For lighting at night, choose low-energy light bulbs that suit a bedroom.

 Choose pillows filled with wool or natural latex, both of 
which are resistant to dust mites. (For more on pillows, see
the section “Pillow talk,” later in this chapter.)
 Some studies indicate that synthetic pillows attract dust
mites. Hypoallergenic and some recycled-content synthetic
pillows are an option.
 Put your pillow in a dust-mite-resistant cover or pillow 
protector.
 Clean pillows and casings often. If you have an allergy 
sufferer in your home, fire up the water heater. Some sources
recommend that temperatures lower than 130°F won’t kill the
dust mites.
 Replace pillows frequently — not the greenest action to 
take — or use pillows that are easily washable.
 Wash bedding often, at least once a week, in hot water.
 Choose hard flooring over carpeting, which is a more hos-
pitable environment for dust mites.
 If you have carpeting, clean weekly or more often using a 
powerful vacuum cleaner with a filter. Empty the disposable
bag or the canister when half full or more: Don’t wait for it 
to be near bursting. (For advice on choosing carpeting made
of ecoconscious material, see Chapter 11.)
 Run an air filter in the bedroom if allergies are a problem.
 Dust the room, using a microfiber cloth to pick up and capture
mites and the dust they rode in on. Skip the feather duster
and dust mop, which simply stir up allergens rather than 
wipe them up. Don’t forget the lampshades, headboard, and
nightstands.
Breathing easily with chemical-free
bedding
Like meditation, sleep is all about breathing out the bad and
breathing in the good. But when your room is riddled with 
chemical-laced furnishings and bedding, you spend eight hours
inhaling all sorts of substances you don’t want in your lungs. 
Your mattress and pillows, for example, may contain synthetic
polyurethane foam, off-gassing as you dream away. Your cotton
sheets may also be laced with pesticides, and finished with a 
petrochemical to prevent wrinkling. (Read Chapter 3 to find 
out more about unhealthy home furnishings and the toxins they
contain.)
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
168

Keeping chemicals out of your bed isn’t easy. Consider, for 
example, that for more than three decades, the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has required mattresses 
to be treated with a flame retardant that can stand up to a direct
cigarette burn. The chemical used is polybrominated diphenyl
ethers (PBDEs). Studies suggest that PBDEs may have an affect on
the thyroid and brain development.
But there’s more: If the care label says “no iron,” “easy care,” or
“stain-resistant,” your sheets may have been treated with
formaldehyde resins. Synthetic down, used in pillows and com-
forters, may contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs). And
cotton, pure, innocent cotton, if grown conventionally, requires
heavy-duty fertilizers and pesticide treatment. It’s enough to give
you nightmares!
To ensure that the air you breathe as you sleep is as free of chemi-
cals and irritants as possible, replace conventional mattresses
treated with flame retardant and buy sheets made of natural mate-
rials grown without fertilizers and pesticides and that haven’t been
treated with synthetic finishes. Choose pillows that are machine-
washable. Cover your mattress and pillows with natural-material,
unbleached, untreated casings.
Greening Your Bedding
In days of old, young girls began at an early age to fill big trunks
they called hope chests, preparing for the time when they’d be 
running and furnishing their own homes. Bed linens, pillow 
cases, and blankets filled the hope chests as the girls readied for
marriage.
If that tradition continued today, most women would have to
switch to a storage unit to contain all the bedding products 
available. With a wider range of bed sizes and styles and a broader
selection of materials, bedding must accommodate all sorts of
options, from California king-sized beds to futons. Green-conscious
consumers choose mattresses, pillows, and bed linens not just for
their style, but also for their environmental merits.
A firm understanding 
of mattress care
Finding a mattress that meets your comfort standard is increas-
ingly easier as more choices are available. Some allow for varying
firmness levels in the same mattress, so you and your partner can
Chapter 10: Creating a Clean and Healthful Sleeping Environment 169

both sleep comfortably in the same bed. And, when it comes to
comfort, mattress size matters. You’ll rest better if you’re not
cramped.
But size and firmness level aren’t the only considerations in 
choosing and maintaining the fundamental backbone of your bed.
Think natural and organic when selecting your mattress. Pass 
up the polyurethane foam and chemically treated products for
organic-content mattresses. Available through a number of 
companies, preferred mattresses typically contain organic cotton,
wool, and natural rubber, all biodegradable materials.
Green mattresses are commonly wrapped in a wool outer layer.
Wool deters dust mites, keeps its shape, wicks moisture, and is 
naturally flame-retardant — all desirable qualities in a mattress.
After you find the perfect mattress, you need to take care of it to
extend its life. Mattresses are designed to last eight to ten years,
although several of the organic brands advertise a life of 20 years.
But you can extend the wear of any mattress by following these
practices:
 Cover the mattress with a mattress pad to keep dust and
dander from collecting.
 Recycle the mattress pad when it’s yellowed or threadbare: 
At that point, it’s no longer doing its job.
 When the bed is stripped, vacuum the mattress to capture
loose dust, dirt, and dust mite residue.
 Flip the mattress over every few months — just like rotating
your tires, this practices makes for more even wear. (Flipping
a large mattress is a two-person job: Watch your back.)
 Clean stains or spills as soon as possible to prevent bacteria
or mildew from developing. Use plain cool water or one of 
the stain-remover recipes in Chapter 6. Let the mattress dry
thoroughly before replacing bedding.
 Air out the mattress — at least every time you change the
mattress pad or flip the mattress. Let the sunshine stream in
and do its disinfecting job for a couple of hours.
Pillow talk
Pillows, like mattresses, are a matter of personal comfort and
choice. Some people prefer firm and flat, while others love 
to sink into a fat, fluffy headrest. Pillow fillers range from synthetic
memory foam to duck down to seedpod fiber from tropical 
rainforest trees.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
170

The stuffing pillows are made of
In addition to aggravating allergies, pillow stuffings measure at
varying degrees on the environmental spectrum. Synthetic-filled
pillows are most abundant in home stores. In addition to contain-
ing petroleum-based content, which offends the green sensibilities
of some people, these pillows are also likely to contain offending
chemicals that irritate respiratory conditions. If buying synthetic,
look for hypoallergenic pillows, at the very least.
Some common fillers that may meet green approval include the 
following.
 Natural latex is a good all-around green choice. Originating
from the rubber plant, latex is rapidly renewable (look for
tapped rubber, not logged) nonallergenic, it discourages dust
mites, bacteria, and mildew, and it’s biodegradable. This
scrunchable, squeezable material maintains its form and can
easily be machine-washed. Natural latex pillows are one of the
cheaper green options.
 Wool may be one of the best choices in terms of health, clean-
liness, and sustainability. Wool lasts longer than most other
materials, so you won’t have to replace pillows as often. It’s
bacteria- and dust-mite resistant, and it wicks away moisture.
Wool fill can feel a little hard for those who like a soft place to
lay their head. Alpaca has similar characteristics as wool, but
is a little softer. Both tend to be one of the pricier choices.
 Cotton is one of the best choices for folks who suffer from
multiple allergies and chemical sensitivities. Cotton stuffing
meets green approval, as long as it’s from 100-percent organic
cotton, grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.
 Down filling is mostly from geese or ducks. Not all down is
created equal: Some pillows also contain other fillers, 
including feathers and, sometimes, synthetic materials.
Down can aggravate allergies, and some pillows advertise 
sanitized down filler, which is said to reduce irritation. Animal
rights activists reject down because of animal cruelty issues.
 Kapok stuffing comes from the seedpods of the tropical rain-
forest tree. The silky filling is lighter than cotton and has a
down-like feel. Kapok is non-allergenic, odorless, and chemical-
free.
 Buckwheat hulls create a form-able pillow filling. Some
asthma sufferers or those with breathing difficulties may have
problems with buckwheat dust. Although the buckwheat is
typically cleaned of most of the dust, some trace amounts
remain. These pillows can crunch when you turn over, so it’s a
different experience.
Chapter 10: Creating a Clean and Healthful Sleeping Environment 171

Caring for pillows
Bed pillows sell for $3 and up, so they’re affordable to replace
often. But frequent replacement doesn’t exactly jibe with a 
sustainable lifestyle. So invest in longer-lasting pillows (wool or
latex), even if they do cost a bit more.
Whatever the content, pillows last longer when well-cared for:
 Use pillow covers or protectors in addition to pillowcases.
These zip-up coverings help reduce dust mite invasion and
keep other pollutants out of the pillow filling.
 Hand-wash wool pillows; machine-wash cotton and synthetic
pillows. Follow manufacturers’ instructions.
 Air out pillows frequently. Strip their coverings and lay them
out in the sun on a blanket. When you make the bed, fluff and
flip the pillows.
 Give pillows a rest. If you have extras, rotate them occasion-
ally. But be sure to store them in the linen closet only after
washing or airing.
Converting to green sheets
Your sheets and pillowcases come in closest contact with your
skin. So the greener the content, the less chance you’re sleeping
with unsafe chemical treatments. Choosing your bed linens from
organically grown or cultivated cotton or silk is the first step. But
be sure, too, that the materials aren’t treated with a chemical flame
retardant or easy-care coating.
A new material choice is bamboo. Who knew that the hard, woody
grass used to support scaffolding in China could produce such
soft, luxurious fabric? Bamboo sheets do feel silky soft. What’s
more, bamboo is a rapidly renewable resource. (Now, if only U.S.
growers would start cultivating it, so green consumers don’t have
to pay such a high carbon price for bamboo shipped from Asia!)
More bamboo benefits? The material is machine-washable,
durable, and antibacterial.
Dealing with dirty linens
The best organic materials are also easily washable. Change 
and wash your bed sheets as needed — more frequently during
sweltering weather and certainly during illness.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
172

I advise changing pillowcases more often than you change your
bed sheets, but at least once a week. Your pillow is where your
head rests, leaving a more tempting feast for dust mites, which
favor dead skin flakes, hair, secretions, oils from lotions, residue
from gels and shampoo, cosmetics, and hairspray.
If you or anyone in your home suffers from allergies, wash sheets
in water hot enough to kill irritants including dust mites — some
recommend 130° or higher. (For more on eliminating dust mites,
see the section “The dirty truth about dust mites,” earlier in the
chapter.) Unless pollen allergies are an issue, hang sheets outside
in the breeze for a heavenly sun-kissed scent that no bottle of
fabric softener can capture.
Letting linens out of the closet
Never store soiled linens: Dirt and perspiration attract mildew.
Whether you stack bedding as sheet sets (bottom and top sheet
plus pillowcases) or store them separately, place the most recently
cleaned linens on the bottom of the stack so that you rotate usage
consistently. This way, the sheets wear for a lot longer.
Linen closets serve you best if they’re dry and cool with ventilated
shelves. Mildew can grow in warm, humid environments. If items
smell musty, give them a good wash and dry before putting them
on the bed. Don’t use sealed plastic bags for storage, as moisture
gets trapped inside and the fabric can’t breathe. Cotton, canvas, or
muslin bags are better choices.
Covering bedspread basics
The spread for your bed reflects your style and personality more
visibly than your other bedding. Bedspreads and comforters 
come in a spectrum of materials and patterns: Chintz, chenille, silk,
batik, and more work to set your bedroom apart and create the
atmosphere that best puts you at rest.
Seasonal change also leads to variety in bed coverings. In hot
weather, a light cotton blanket or spread keeps you comfortable; in
winter, a down comforter layers you in warmth. Some lightweight
comforters can work in the summer in cold climates or year-round
in warm climates.
Because they’re not next to your skin, you can get away with less
frequent washing for blankets, bedspreads, and their accompany-
ing bed skirts and sham coverings. (Even hotels don’t wash their
spreads as often as their sheets, which is why you’re advised not
to come into contact with the covering.)
Chapter 10: Creating a Clean and Healthful Sleeping Environment 173

For easiest care and greenest practices at home, however, follow
this advice:
 Use comforters, blankets, and other bed coverings that are
machine-washable. Avoid those that must be dry-cleaned, a
highly toxic process involving the chemical perchloroethylene.
 If your spread must be dry-cleaned, seek out a cleaner that
uses one of the more Earth-friendly processes. (Read Chapter 9
for more on the implications of dry cleaning.)
 If you use a comforter, slip on a duvet cover and cut down on
care. This cover can be buttoned or zipped on and washed
separately. Duvet covers are inexpensive, and you can have
several to change decor with the seasons.
 Air out down comforters by hanging them outdoors in the sun
or at least toss them in the air some when making the bed to
evenly redistribute the contents.
 Launder washable covers and spreads according to label
instructions. Cold water is likely suitable for most materials. 
If you or someone else in your home has allergies, wash 
in hot water.
Furnishings for Clean and Green
If you’re following feng shui advice and arranging your bedroom to
be simple, serene, and minimalist, you’ll have made your cleaning
job easier just because you have less clutter in the room. At center
stage in any bedroom is, no surprise, the bed. Some streamlined,
modern rooms may not have much more than a bed, with walk-in
closets and wall systems for clothing storage. But, still, most bed-
rooms contain auxiliary furnishings: dressers, nightstands, maybe
a chair or two. And they, too, have implications for cleaning and
greening.
In the past, furniture was made with pride of craftsmanship,
reflecting care in material selection and skill in construction. Thus,
many bedroom sets have been passed down from generation to
generation. Whether you’re sleeping in your great-grandparents’
four-poster or you snagged a mint-condition sleigh bed at an
antique auction, you’re sure to sleep better over your good green
choice — using old instead of buying new.
If you buy modern furnishings, seek quality construction and 
materials that last. To make the most sustainable choice, dig a
little further to find out what your furniture is made of and how it
was manufactured. Notice the use of more rattan and seagrass for
accent chairs and headboards, all very Earth-friendly.

Looking for certified-green wood
The making of wood furniture involves, no surprise, trees. With
concerns about deforestation and the subsequent loss of biodiver-
sity and threat to wildlife, indigenous populations, and air and
water quality, wood matters. Some of the most coveted woods
come from at-risk trees and forests. On top of that, the conversion
of trees into furniture is an energy-intense process with a steep
carbon impact.
Look for the label that indicates third-party certification that the
wood has been managed and harvested in an environmentally
responsible manner. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is the
oldest and most recognized designation, but the Sustainable
Forestry Initiative (SFI) is increasingly used. Many manufacturers
seek both certifications. Seek out more information from FSC
(www.fscus.org) and SFI (www.sfiprogram.org).
Also consider these questions:

Feng shui for positive energy
An ancient belief system born in China thousands of years ago, feng shui (pro-
nounced fung SHWAY) is the practice of creating and moving positive chi, energy,
to improve all aspects of life. In popular culture, however, the art is more familiar
as the arrangement of a space.
Whether you’re a believer or consider it a superstition, feng shui principles tend to
follow common sense. For example, in the bedroom, feng shui guidelines advise:
 Placing the bed so that it’s not blocking a window or directly facing the door.
 Ridding the room of extra objects that add clutter and distraction.
 Decorating in cool, tranquil colors.
 Arranging furniture so that chi can easily flow (therefore, air can circulate).
 Locating the bedroom in a part of the house with low activity.
If you’re interested in more information about this ancient practice, read Feng Shui
For Dummies (Wiley) by David Daniel Kennedy for advice on decorating your home,
improving your health, furthering your career, and enhancing your relationships
through balancing and harnessing life energy.

 How far did the wood travel? When you know the forest of
origin (which you can find out by looking up the manufacturer
on the FSC Web site, www.fscus.org), you can determine how
far your wood had to travel. Your bedroom furniture may have
traveled across the ocean before settling into your room.
When possible, buy local — or as close to home as possible.
(For more on the benefits of buying local, see Chapter 14.)
 What’s holding it all together? And then there’s how the 
furniture is made. Your dresser may be wood-based, but
pressed wood, particle board, veneers, and laminates — all
common in manufactured furniture — contain formaldehyde,
identified by the EPA as a known carcinogen. (Read more
about home furnishings and indoor air pollution in Chapter 3.)
If you’re buying your bedroom set used, then chances are 
all the chemicals have already off-gassed, and risk to lungs 
is minimal. But when buying new, look for FSC-certified, solid
hardwood pieces free of laminates or finishes that contain
formaldehyde to ensure that you can breathe easy around
your own bedroom furnishings.
Caring for furniture
Keep your bedroom furniture clean and gleaming as you would
other wood furniture in your home. A regular dusting with a
microfiber cloth or slightly damp rag picks up most dust and loose
mites. If you want to use a spray cleaner — purchased or home-
made — spray it on the cloth and then wipe instead of spraying
directly on the wood. (See Chapter 6 for recipes for wood cleaners
and polishes.)
For upholstered furniture, get out crumbs and crud that get 
caught between cushions and fabric folds by using the vacuum’s
upholstery attachment. Take off the cushions and vacuum 
underneath. Shake the cushions outside if possible or fluff them 
in place. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for getting out
spills or stains. If uncertain, start with plain water and then move
on to stronger methods. (See Chapter 9 for tips on cleaning 
various fabrics.)
Taking Easy Steps to Floor 
Options and Care
When it comes to the bedroom, the best flooring choice underfoot
is one that enhances quiet and is a breeze to clean. While carpeting
is definitely the best for absorbing sound, other materials are
easier to keep clean.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
176

Many people want to put their feet on soft, warm carpet or an area
rug when they climb out of bed in the morning. But carpeting also
provides a cozy home for dust mites and collects dirt, so once a
week vacuuming is a must. Clean up spills when they occur. And
steam-clean yearly or every 18 months. Dust mites hate hot steam.
If you’re replacing carpet, go for recycled-content, no-VOC content.
Small area rugs come in all sorts of natural, sustainable materials,
including sisal and other grasses and rushes, hemp, and organic
wool and cotton. You can wash, vacuum, or shake clean most rugs.
For bamboo, cork, and wood floors, a light vacuuming with a soft
nozzle head should take care of them most of the time. Pick up
small debris and wipe up spills as they happen. Use a mop that’s
barely damp with warm water to pick up those elusive dust 
bunnies that a dry mop just shoves around. (Don’t saturate cork 
or wood.)
In warm climates, tile is a popular flooring material for the bed-
room, providing a cooling surface underfoot. Although its manufac-
ture demands a high energy toll, tile is often produced from
recycled ceramic tile and glass. Either way, it’s durable and super-
easy to clean. A damp mop and any of your all-purpose cleaners
(see Chapter 6) is all it takes.
Get into the practice of removing shoes before entering your 
bedroom — or your house, for that matter. This step reduces soil
buildup on floors, meaning that you clean less frequently.
Creating a Safe, Green 
Haven for Kids
When it comes to children’s bedrooms, safety is of paramount 
concern. Kids, and especially babies, are more susceptible to
breathing problems caused by poor indoor air quality. Their skin 
is particularly vulnerable if exposed to toxic finishes on furniture
or fabric. And furniture itself can pose safety risks — from window
cords to bureaus and shelves that could topple over.
Steps you take from both a green and clean perspective can help
reduce the risk and create a safe and nurturing environment for
your children to sleep and play.
Chapter 10: Creating a Clean and Healthful Sleeping Environment 177

Setting up a nursery
The space where the littlest family member sleeps requires 
special considerations. Before the arrival of your infant, make sure
that all clothing, diapers, and bedding have been thoroughly
washed in gentle soap. If any finishes or substances linger in the
fabric, a good wash should minimize their effect on your baby.
Vacuum floors, dust the room, and scrub all furnishings with a mild
solution, such as vinegar and water, or liquid soap. (See Chapter 6
for recipes.)
Arrange the furniture for maximum safety. Set up the changing
table so that you can reach diapers, powder, and supplies without
leaving the baby unattended. Position the crib away from the
window. Cord pulls pose a risk to babies and toddlers, as they can
result in strangulation. Remove cord pulls.
Because babies grow out of their clothes and furniture so fast, it
only makes sense — from a cost and environmental standpoint —
to buy or borrow used clothing and furniture.
If you have the opportunity to reuse, by all means, go for it —
unless the crib is so damaged or worn or doesn’t meet the 
most current safety regulations. The Consumer Product Safety
Commission Web site at www.cpsc.gov discloses safety standards
and lists recall notices for cribs, playpens, car seats, and other
baby equipment and toys. (Sign up on the site for e-mail 
announcements of recalls.)
Safety standards provide in-depth detail, from the size of the mesh
on playpens to how screws and brackets are installed. Other key
issues are
 Distance between crib slats
 Paint or finish (older cribs may contain lead paint)
 Cutouts on headboard or footboard where baby’s head could
get trapped
 Height of sides of crib
 The fit of the mattress in the crib, so baby can’t get caught 
in between
In addition to mattress fit, the content of your mattress is also of
concern. Don’t accept old mattresses, which may be harboring
mildew, bacteria, and dust mites, and definitely don’t buy a new
mattress made of polyurethane or other off-gassing content.
Instead, seek out mattresses made from natural materials: wool,
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
178

cotton, and natural latex. (Read “Breathing easily with chemical-
free bedding,” for more about what to avoid in mattresses.)
Combination wool and cotton mattresses are readily available.
If you have hand-me-down linens from an older child, so much the
better, but sort out those items that are ripped, stained, or high-
maintenance. Makers of baby clothes and bedding are well aware
of the green movement, especially when it comes to infants, so
many now offer attractive new easy-care products of 100-percent
organic cotton.
Keep baby bedding to a minimum. For infants less than a year old,
the CPSC recommends eliminating pillows, quilts, comforters,
sheepskins, pillow-like bumper pads, or pillow-like stuffed toys in
the crib — even blankets and loose sheets, all of which have been
linked to infant suffocation.
Doing diaper duty
Diapers are one of the most controversial home-cleaning issues 
to discuss. Environmentalists decry the waste of energy and
resources on throwaway products, while others insist that the
amount of water and energy used to clean cloth diapers is equally
or more damaging to the environment. Even if energy costs are a
wash, it’s hard to make a case for disposables when you consider
that 3.5 million tons of dirty disposables are dumped in landfills
each year.
Some disposable diapers have SAP: not what’s secreted by trees,
but super absorbent polymers, sodium polyacrylate crystals. 
SAP keeps disposables smaller while bestowing them with 
super absorbing power. The substance has a number of uses, 
in agriculture and gardening, and was a component of tampons
until it was linked to toxic shock syndrome and banned.
Disposable diapers also contain other elements that cause concern:
synthetic materials manufactured from petroleum products; a chlo-
rine bleaching process with a toxic byproduct (dioxin); fragrances;
and wood-pulp content that may carry traces of pesticide.
The “bottom” line is that 95 percent of American parents use dis-
posable diapers at least some of the time for their babies and tod-
dlers. Whether you choose to go with disposals all the time or for
convenience situations, select a brand made of organic cotton or
unbleached paper or wood pulp, and no dyes. Various brands that
identify themselves as “alternative” diapers may include all these
characteristics, although some use conventional cotton or contain
SAP. Some hybrid products include a washable outer cover and a
throwaway liner.
Chapter 10: Creating a Clean and Healthful Sleeping Environment 179

If you go the cloth route, be prepared for a little more effort in
cleaning and combating diaper-pail odor. And, as with so 
many green practices, you may have to take one step back to 
move forward:
 Choose organic cotton diapers.
 Flush and rinse soiled diapers before placing in the diaper pail.
 Wash frequent loads, as often as every day.
 Pre-soak in hot water and machine-wash in hot water with a
cold rinse.
 Wash in a mild soap (see Chapter 6 for recipes), avoiding 
softeners and products with perfumes and dyes.
 Deodorize the diaper pail with a half-cup of borax every time
you empty.
 Wash out the pail occasionally with hot water and soap. Or on
a warm day, hose it out in the backyard and let it disinfect
under the sun.
If you want cloth diapers without much fuss, sign on for a diaper
service. Your dirty diapers are picked up weekly and exchanged 
for a clean, fresh supply. Be prepared to find out, however, that 
the process for cleaning and sanitizing industrial-sized loads of 
diapers is anything but Earth-friendly — lots of energy, lots of
water, and lots of driving. Diaper services may not be available
where you live.
Trouble in toyland
With the recalls of toys from China, parents are on high alert 
about the safety of toys, both for infants and for older children.
About 80 percent of toys sold in the United States, including those
by well-known makers, are manufactured in China. In addition to
lead-based paint and other dangerous content, toys pose dangers
in their small, removable parts. In 2007, 25 million toys were
recalled in the United States.
Phthalates have come under particular scrutiny. The petroleum-
based chemical is used as a softener in plastics, including toys,
and has been linked to some serious health effects, including
cancer and reproductive issues. (Read Chapter 3 for more about
phthalate concerns.)
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
180

Since 1999, manufacturers have stopped using phthalates in paci-
fiers and teething toys. But babies aren’t very discriminating about
what they put in their mouths, as any parent knows. As retail
chains respond to increasing consumer demand for more stringent
product standards, parents are wise to investigate the content 
of any toy they purchase for their infant or older child. Meantime,
in summer 2008, the U.S. Congress banned six phthalates from 
children’s toys. The best source for information on toy safety is the
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
“Clean your room!”
The basics of bedroom furnishing and cleaning are the same for
kids as for adults. As children become old enough to assume some
responsibility, cleaning duties are a good way to teach them the
importance of taking care of their possessions. Encourage them to
clean for themselves, taking on the dusting, sweeping, and tidying
up of their space.
Recognizing that your child’s answer to the question, “Did you
clean your room?” may be different than yours, take these steps to
help him learn the value of clean and green:
 Keep play and sleep separate, if possible, relegating toys,
games, the TV, and even the study area to another area 
of the house — or at least removed from the bed area. This
separation makes it easier for kids to keep their room clean
and creates a more conducive environment for sleep.
 Keep health and ease of maintenance in mind when decorat-
ing a child’s room: Minimize carpeting, fussy window 
treatments, upholstered furniture, and excess bedding to
reduce dust mite and allergen issues — and make the space
easier to clean.
 Minimize visible clutter by providing good storage: a toy box
or open tote or secured wall unit with drawers and bins to
keep things off the floor.
 Set up a closed laundry hamper in the bedroom to prevent
dirty clothes from ending up under the bed, in the closet, or
even shoved back into drawers along with the clean.
 Establish some house rules, such as no eating in the bedroom
and putting clothes away immediately, to avoid common 
battles. Some families find a Saturday morning cleaning 
routine is more successful than constant nagging.

Speed Cleaning: What You Can 
Do in Under 15 Minutes
True, your bedroom is seldom seen by company. And when you’re
there, you spend most of your time with your eyes closed. But
that’s no reason to neglect creating a clean, serene space. Do it for
yourself! Trust me, tucking into a tidy sanctuary at the end of the
day is certain to make your dreams sweeter and put more bounce
in your step when you wake up. Take just 15 minutes first thing in
the morning to create a peaceful retreat that you look forward to at
the end of the day — you deserve it.
 Pick up clothes, shoes, books, magazines, and other objects
from the floor, bed, or nightstand.
 Make the bed — it’s the largest object in the room and has the
biggest visual impact.
 Shut the closet doors and dresser drawers.
 Take a quick run-through with a microfiber dust cloth and
vacuum.
 Open window blinds and drapes to let the sun do its work.

Greening and Cleaning 
the Living Room
In This Chapter
 Getting to the bottom of floor and carpet care
 Caring for furniture and upholstery
 Cleaning walls, windows, electronics, and more
W
hether referred to as living room, family room, TV room, or
great room, the area serves as a gathering space for kids
and parents, guests, and relatives — in short, it is a “living” room.
Alas, all this activity and traffic can mean only one thing to the
homeowner: lots of cleaning. If young children spend time here
playing, crayons and clay end up embedded in the carpet or
couch. If a lot of parties take place in this space, count on wine
stains or guacamole spills and crumbs between the cushions. If
teenagers plop onto the sofa after soccer practice and spend an
evening watching TV, the odor of sweaty clothes and smelly socks
may cling to the room. And if pets also share these areas, consider
the room a collection center for cat hair and dander — and worse.
For those committed to creating a sustainable living room, addi-
tional challenges present themselves, regarding furnishings and
cleaners, and toxic materials and indoor air quality. A place your
family spends its time must be as safe and clean as possible. You
also confront the potential for high energy use in this area:
Maintaining a comfortable temperature means counting on air con-
ditioning or heat; frequent use of the TV, music system, computer,
and even lights for reading all add to the energy drain.
Arranging, maintaining, and cleaning your living area make the
space where you spend more waking hours a more pleasant place
to be. In this chapter, I discuss energy issues and how to maintain
a clean and comfortable green living area, highlighting features
most often found in living rooms, such as carpeting, upholstered
furniture, and TV and electronics, in order to create a room that
lives up to its name.

Gaining a Solid Appreciation 
for Hard-Surface Floors
Because of allergies to dust mites, which burrow in carpeting 
and other home textiles, hard-surface floors are increasingly a 
popular — and fashionable — floor choice. Living with such floor-
ing is easy, with many green choices even in the big box chains.
(Read more about the pluses of hard-surface floors in Chapter 7.)
The greenest floor, of course, is the one you have now: Replacing
anything means more depletion of resources and energy 
consumption, which creates greenhouse gas emissions.
But give yourself extra green points if you’re walking on hard 
flooring, especially if it’s from
 Reclaimed wood
 Hardwood from a third-party certification, such as FSC or SFI
(www.fsc.org or www.sfiprogram.org)
 Sustainably harvested and manufactured bamboo or cork,
both rapidly renewable materials
 Linoleum, based on linseed oil
 Recycled-content tile, especially appealing for warmer climes
 Concrete (yes, concrete, though hard, can be a sustainable
choice, providing easy maintenance, good energy efficiency,
and cozy comfort if coupled with an under-the-floor radiant
heating system or partly covered with an area rug)
Most hard-surface flooring is a snap to clean. (Find detailed 
cleaning advice in Chapter 7.) Do follow the manufacturer’s 
guidelines for cleaning — if you no longer have them, you can 
usually track them down online.
Rolling Out the Green Carpet
A soft, buffering carpet underfoot has always been a sign of 
comfort, pampering, and even luxury. It makes for a kinder place
for toddlers learning to walk, a cozier path for maneuvering in
cold-weather locales, and an acoustical barrier to soften the sound
in the house.
Carpet, whether area rugs or wall-to-wall, can be a good choice for
the living area. But it also presents issues both green and clean.
You can resolve most challenges, however, with a little information
and a bit of know-how.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
184

Sustainable choices underfoot
Traditionally, most carpeting is made from synthetic materials,
such as nylon and polyester — materials from petroleum, which
may also add a layer of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that
may irritate breathing passages while off-gassing. Layered on 
top of that (or underneath, to be more exact), are the backing
materials, adhesives, and carpet pads, which also emit VOCs.
Good news: You can find more and more green carpet — in all
colors. The Carpet and Rug Institute has established the Green
Label Plus certification to identify carpet products that meet its
low-emission standards. Consider that label as a starting point, 
but if you’re set on wall-to-wall carpet that’s safe and sustainable:
 Settle on natural-material carpeting, most often wool, silk, 
or cotton.
 Seek synthetic-based carpeting made from recycled carpet
materials, which means a lot less waste of resources.
 Look for backing materials made of natural content including
hemp, jute, and natural rubber, or choose a carpet without
backing.
 Avoid products made with synthetic glues and adhesives.
Some recycled-content carpeting comes in pop-in-place tiles, which
means no VOC-laden adhesives. Another plus: They’re easily
replaceable. Spill something particularly nasty and permanent, and
you can just pop out the square and put a new one in. Flip to the
Appendix for a list of sources for sustainable carpeting.
Many carpet manufacturers are introducing take-back programs,
which allow consumers to return their old carpeting for recycling
instead of dumping it in a landfill. Getting rid of your old carpet in
this manner may raise some other environmental issues: If the
manufacturers who accept it aren’t nearby, delivering a truckload
of worn, dingy rug requires some fuel investment. Visit the Carpet
America Recovery site at www.carpetrecovery.org to find 
participating companies in your area.
Calling pests and pets on the carpet
Another challenge with wall-to-wall carpeting is its propensity for
harboring irritants that cause health problems. Dirt, dust, mold,
and other allergens find carpeting just as cozy as humans do.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 185

 Dust mites: Just as they do in bed sheets, pillows, and 
fabrics in the bedroom, dust mites are likely to burrow into
your floor cover and leave their asthma-provoking droppings
in your living room. (Find out how you can battle dust mites
in Chapter 10.)
 Carpet beetles: Wool carpeting, along with leather and wood
fiber, is a favorite feast of both the varied carpet beetle and
black carpet beetle. Once they get into your home, they can
attack carpeting as if it were an all-you-can-eat buffet. Prevent
infestations with frequent vacuuming. Once they settle in,
they’re hard to get rid of and may destroy the carpet.
Read Carpet Cleaning Tips For Dummies, which I wrote, for
more detail about carpet beetles. Meantime, if you see them
wandering across the carpet (and I have seen dozens of them
when I was a guest in a Midwest home), they’ve come to stay.
At that point, you have to bring in the professionals to have
them evicted, or you learn to ignore them, which apparently
these homeowners did.
 Pet odors and stains: In addition to pet hair and dander, your
beloved four-legged family members are as likely to have
“accidents” on carpeting as small children — and these
messes do the same damage. Carpeting seems to be a sponge
for pet odors; more often than not, you can easily pick out the
dog’s favorite nap corner simply by smell.
 Mildew and mold: Anything from a spill to a pet accident to a
humid house can result in carpet mold and mildew. (You can
usually smell or see mildew and mold.) Once it takes hold, the
best cure is to toss the carpet and the pad.
Cleaning and caring for carpeting
The best defense against carpet challenges is prevention: Vacuum
regularly, keep carpeting dry, and discourage pets from sleeping
directly on the floor. Dogs should have their own beds and 
area rugs.
For regular maintenance of any carpeting, a good vacuum cleaner
is best for the job. A machine with a high efficiency particulate air
(HEPA) filter removes tiny particles, such as pollens, dust, and,
dander, relieving those who suffer from common allergens. (Turn
to Chapter 5 for further information about vacuum cleaners.)
A vacuum with a CRI Seal of Approval/Green Label passes many
tests on soil removal, carpet texture retention, and dust contain-
ment. The Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) approved vacuums must
not release more than 100 micrograms of dust particles per cubic
meter of air.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
186

To maximize your vacuum cleaner’s effectiveness, concentrate 
on smaller sections of the carpet by making four strokes with 
the machine in a fan shape. Then move on to the next section 
of the rug.
For large area rugs, start from the center of the carpet and 
vacuum toward the edges, being careful not to catch any fringe 
in the beaters.
Getting out common stains and spills
Quick action can save you from massive cleanup jobs or hiring the
professionals. Don’t ever let a stain set: Address it immediately by
following these steps:
1. Absorb the spill with a dry cloth or paper towel and
vacuum up solids (such as spilled soil from a plant or
food crumbs) or pick up larger pieces with a towel.
2. Wipe or blot with a cloth saturated with a mixture 
of one-part-vinegar and one-part-water to neutralize 
the smell.
3. Treat or spot-clean the stain with plain water applied
with a sponge or cloth.
Blot; don’t scrub.
4. If the stain is stubborn, try adding a little dishwashing
liquid.
For treating specific stains such as blood, ink, or wine, see
Chapter 9.
5. Blot-dry with a clean cloth and allow to air-dry.
Never use laundry detergent with bleach to remove carpet stains.
Refer to the cleaning instructions from the carpet manufacturer for
specific treatment.
Time for a deep cleaning
When carpeting begins to show a traffic pattern, it’s a sign that a
deeper cleaning may be due. Most carpeting requires a deep-clean
every year or two, depending upon the wear the room sees.
Rather than resorting to harsh carpet cleaners, which contain the
same kinds of toxic components that some carpet materials do,
limit your deep-clean to a steam-vacuum process, sometimes
referred to as extraction cleaning. The steam seeps deeper into 
the carpet, knocking the heck out of dust mites and picking up
embedded dirt. If you don’t own a steam cleaner, you can find
them for rent at many grocery stores. Steam cleaning is covered in
more detail in Chapter 5.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 187

If you want a thorough clean but don’t want to hassle with moving
furniture and renting a steam vacuum, consider a carpet-cleaning
service. These services use a variety of techniques, including
chemicals, but most often they stick to deep steam-cleaning. For
information about services in your area, the Institute of Inspection,
Cleaning, and Restorations Certification (IICRC) represents 
more than 4,500 Certified Firms and more than 45,000 Certified
Technicians in 30 countries (www.certifiedcleaners.org).
After steaming, stay off the carpet until it’s completely dry. Don’t
put furniture back too soon, or you may get rust stains on the
carpet or finish damage on the furniture.
Choosing area rugs for easy care
Another solution for those who love the feel of carpet underfoot is
to use area rugs in places where you put your feet: in front of the
sofa, in a play area, at the entrances to the living area.
Area rugs can be nearly as large as the room itself — or small
enough to serve as a center focus for a seating area. They come in
a variety of shapes, including oval, square, rectangular, and long,
narrow runners. They can be picked up and removed for cleaning.
You can shake out smaller throw rugs or toss them in the washing
machine and roll up larger ones to beat and hang outside or
deliver to a professional cleaner.
Area rugs come in a broad range of materials and designs: You can
spend thousands on hand-loomed wool rugs from India or a few
dollars for a rag-braided throw. Some, like wall-to-wall carpeting,
are made of synthetic materials. Other common fibers are wool
and cotton, but plant fibers, including grasses (such as seagrass
and sisal), also make great area rugs. Increasingly, bamboo is used
for area rugs, as well.
When choosing area rugs for a green home, look for the same 
factors you do for carpeting:
 Natural materials, such as cotton, wool, seagrass, sisal, or
bamboo
 Natural dyes rather than synthetic colors
 Adhesives with low or zero volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), which can aggravate and cause respiratory problems
 Backing made of a natural material such as jute or burlap
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
188

When you clean an area rug, you have a little more liberty than 
you would with a tacked-down room carpet:
 Toss small throw rugs in the washing machine, making sure
that you don’t wash them with anything else the first couple
of times in case the dyes bleed. Cold water is best, unless 
dust mites are a concern — then, only the hottest water 
eliminates them.
 To cut your cleaning time in half with throw rugs, choose
styles without backing that you can flip over when one side
gets dirty. I have a braided oval-shaped porch rug with 
a permanent stain on one side, so when company is coming, 
I flip the stained side to the bottom.
 Between washings, take throws outside and shake them.
Depending on your indoor foot traffic, you may want to shake
them out every few days. If fading color isn’t an issue, lay 
out the throws to get a little solar disinfecting.
 Roll up larger area rugs and carry them outside to beat 
the dirt out with an old-fashioned rug beater, an old tennis
racquet, or a baseball bat. Hang them over a strong 
clothesline or a sturdy fence and beat away.
Rug-making enterprises in some developing countries have
become infamous for their use of child labor. These children are
often forced to work for more hours a day than upstart attorneys
adding up billable hours, often under abominable conditions. To
avoid supporting this practice, when purchasing a rug made in
countries such as India, Nepal, and Pakistan, look for the Rugmark
label. The Rugmark Foundation has been certifying child-labor-free
rugs for more than 13 years. Visit www.rugmark.org for more
information and for retailers near you that sell Rugmark-certified
floor coverings.
Upholstery: The Great 
Furniture Coverup
Most living room furniture — at least the stuff you sit on — is
padded for comfort and covered, or upholstered, with a fabric that
you chose because it fit your style or room decor. Not too long ago,
if you changed your mind at a later date, you didn’t have to replace
the sofa or chairs: All you had to do was reupholster in a new
fabric that better suited your evolving tastes.

Living with pets: Mi casa es su casa
Based on the merits of cleanliness alone, pets sharing living space with humans is
an unequivocal “no.” But tell that to the 45 million dog owners and 77 million cat
owners in the United States. Don’t bother arguing that their furry housemates bring
in who-knows-what on the bottom of their paws, and that even the cleanest of cats
can be counted on to bring up a hairball now and again. And all that hair and dander
builds up the dust bunnies in the corners and guarantees the routine need for a lint
brush.
If your cat, dog, rabbit, ferret, bird, snake, or (gulp) tarantula has the run of the house,
these tips are sure to help you keep a leash on your home’s cleanliness and show
your pet who’s in charge:
 Wash the pet bed or favorite blanket weekly. If your dog or cat sleeps on your
bed, wash the bedding more frequently. If fleas or dust mites are a concern (and
they always are), wash in hot water.
 Discourage your pet from sleeping or sitting directly on upholstery. If you can’t
persuade Mitzy or Bruno to give up the couch, put down a blanket to keep your
furniture from wearing and taking on a permanent pet odor.
 If possible, steer clear of skirting on sofas and chairs. It can take a lot of wear,
what with dogs rubbing up against it or cats slipping under the couch to hide.
 Try to keep pets corralled in one or two areas of the house and keep other rooms
off-limits. Restricting your pets’ roaming area reduces the amount of special
cleaning attention you have to exert.
 Get your pets to follow the same rule as everyone else: “Wipe your paws before
you come in!” Be sure a good doormat is at the entrances they use and give
them a little assist. Keep an old towel by the door so that you can wipe muddy
paws before they head inside and jump on the couch.
 If your pet insists on communing with nature on a regular basis, weekly baths
may be a good idea. Dogs often enjoy bath time. Cats, on the other hand, not so
much, but they’ll survive a quick dip in the tub.
 Both dogs and cats benefit from regular brushing, which reduces the amount
of pet hair that ends up on your couch and carpet.
 For dog walks, replace your standard scoop bags with biodegradable bags. At
this time, I can’t inform you of any good use for this “output,” as there isn’t much
call for dog manure yet. But at least you can rest assured that the bags in the
landfill are biodegrading.
 Turn your nose up at toxic flea collars and topical drops and instead seek out
gentle flea treatments first. Some pet owners swear by natural remedies, includ-
ing clove, citrus, or eucalyptus oils diluted in water and sprayed onto the pet’s
fur. Garlic is another topical application.

Somewhere along the line, however, reupholstering became as
expensive as — and oftentimes more pricy than —simply buying
new furniture. How crazy is that? Don’t get me wrong: I appreciate
the skill and time required to reupholster; and the increasingly rare
individuals and enterprises that provide such a service earn their
money. But what’s off-kilter is that furniture is produced so cheaply
and with materials that, while they don’t seem to last more than
ten years or so, come from nonrenewable synthetic resources.
Until economies can be right-sized so that it makes more sense 
to invest in a sturdy and enduring sofa skeleton that you can
update with new fabric every decade or longer, your best bet is 
to take good care of your furniture so that you can squeeze as
many years as possible out of them before you have to face the
reupholster-or-replace dilemma.
Judging a chair by its cover
If the inside of your furniture is akin to “good bones,” then you
view the upholstery as skin: It’s more delicate and fragile, but 
with care and attention, it can look as flawless in the second half 
of its life.
Certain fabrics age better than others: For seating surfaces, a
medium-weight material with some texture to it — corduroy,
tweed, raw silk — ages better than a smooth, shiny fabric.
Look for natural fibers, such as cotton, linen, ramie, hemp,
bamboo, or bark cloth, or animal-based fabric, such as wool
(sheep hair) or silk. A recent addition to upholstery fabric is 
recycled-content synthetic material.
A clean finish
Perhaps even more important than the fabric is the finish that may
be coating the fabric. Upholstered furniture is often finished with a
number of compounds that reduce wrinkling, repel water, resist
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 191
 Ditch chew toys made of PVC or other plastic materials, which may be as
unhealthy for pets as they are for humans. Expect to find green toys for dogs
and cats in most pet-supply chain stores.
 Your pets are another good reason to keep an organically maintained yard:
Fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides can make your pet very ill.

stains, and protect from fire. But many of these chemicals have
been found to produce VOCs, which are linked to health issues,
such as cancer, and also irritate respiratory illnesses. Look for 
furniture or fabric that is free of
 Formaldehyde
 Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), (TEFLON) a likely human 
carcinogen
 Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), which act as flame
retardants
A number of companies manufacture upholstered furniture pro-
duced in a sustainable way and without identified toxic chemicals.
Reupholstering: Giving your couch a new lease on life
If your sofa or chair is in good shape except for a little wear,
instead of replacing it, revive it with a slipcover or new upholstery.
You keep it out of the landfill and it gets a whole new look. You also
give a finish-soaked couch that off-gassed its last VOC years ago a
chance to redeem itself by taking on a green persona with a natu-
ral, nonfinished fabric.
Be forewarned that reupholstering is expensive and can take
months — it’s a labor-intensive process that requires human hands
rather than machine technology. It’s also very difficult to imagine
how a sofa will look from a swatch of fabric. The larger the swatch,
the better.
When reupholstering, don’t think just about the surface fabric, but
consider adding extra padding, building up the chair or sofa so
that it is firm and supportive. Get rid of any slump or dip in the
chair seat or chair back. Think about replacing or at least supple-
menting those petroleum-based cushions under the fabric with 
natural-content stuffing, such as wool and alpaca. (Alpaca is 
naturally hypoallergenic because it doesn’t have the lanolin 
normally associated with wool.)
Slipcovers for protection
Another solution for a shabby-looking sofa or chair is to slip-cover
it. Even if you have the slipcover custom-fit, it’s significantly
cheaper than a reupholster, and you still have the chance to use 
a more Earth-friendly covering. You can also find plenty of 
“ready-to-wear” slipcovers.
Another plus: Your slipcover can save your original fabric some
wear and tear. You may even have one made when you purchase
the furniture and keep it on most of the time. This way, you whip 
it off when it’s time for a wash. Slipcovers should be machine-
washable.

Keeping upholstery clean
When you opt out of the fabric finish, you do want to be more 
careful about spills and wear on your furniture. Your best bet is 
to enforce a no-eating-in-the-living-room policy, but I know how
unrealistic that is. So your back-up strategy is to be judicious
about what you eat (opt for pretzels over chips and salsa) and how
you sit (keep shoes off the arms and call it off-limits to the dog).
Then you needn’t have a difficult time of cleaning up.
 Remove pillows and cushions and vacuum with the crevice
tool (see Chapter 5 if you’re unfamiliar with the different
attachments), reaching into the dark recesses to suck up 
popcorn kernels along with all the detritus that gets lost
under the cushions.
 Use the upholstery nozzle to go over the cushions. Fluff or
punch them to shape up the stuffing, and set them back 
in place.
 Take care of spots or stains as soon as possible, following 
the manufacturer’s guidelines. If you don’t want to use the
offensive chemical cleaner recommended, try baking soda
and the tiniest bit of water to pull a stain out.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 193
Something borrowed, something green:
Resurrecting flea market finds
When it comes to furnishing your living areas, you can spend a hefty chunk of
change on living room sets. And sustainably designed and manufactured furniture
is typically not cheap. You may opt to support these noble industries that live up to
quality craftsmanship and environmental ideals. Or you can take a different green
path and buy used. On one end of the spectrum are antiques, but be prepared to
pay “Antique Road Show” prices. At the other end are flea markets, garage sales,
and Craig’s List (www.craigslist.com).
Why is used green? When no new finite resources must be sacrificed to furnish
your new digs. You can even buy particleboard and pressed-wood pieces, which
are notorious for leaching VOCs when new, because their off-gassing days are long
behind them.
Tucked in the corners of dusty second-hand stores and salvage shops are ugly-
duckling pieces that never get a second glance. But clean the disfiguring stain,
dress the piece up in new fabric or give it a coat of paint — or just a good scrub —
and, voilà: You reveal a showcase coffee table, a great wing chair, or a funky
Victorian console turned into a flat-screen TV-stand.

 Do not wash or soak the fabric: You may end up with a 
permanent water stain and get the stuffing wet, which can
lead to mildew or mold.
 With natural cushion materials (feathers or wool), fluff 
daily — but don’t overdo it.
Zen and the Art of Dusting
Aside from carpet and floor care and the unique demands of caring
for upholstered furniture, much of the work in cleaning the living
room involves the simple act of dusting. The most mundane of
housekeeping chores takes on a meditative aspect for me. I can
mindfully move through my living room, connecting with every
lamp, book, end table, and framed art with a certain detachment.
Dusting is a simple act, not much more complex than breathing,
and requires nothing more than a dust cloth.
That near-invisible whisper of sediment that’s equally happy to
settle on houseplants, coffee tables, valuable artwork, or electron-
ics is dust made up of pollen, lint, pet hair and dander, and teeny
particles of dirt that drift in from outdoors or from room to room.
Your living room collects more or less dust, depending on the
activities inside and outside of your home, the inhabitants, and the
air flow.
Because it’s light, dust floats around in the air until it settles on
surfaces like tables and floors. You want to minimize dust inside
because you don’t want to breathe it. Air or vacuum filters or a
dust mop or cloth are the devices typically used to capture dust
and remove it from the home environment.
Walking the labyrinth of dusting
Tables and other flat surfaces covered with knick knacks are useful
for collecting dust (I bet you never thought of it that way before)
and keeping it off the carpet or other fabrics so that dust mites and
other vermin don’t settle in.
So the last thing you want to do is whisk all that dust to the floor.
Dusting is a mindful activity — not a mindless one. And here’s a
mindful approach to follow:
 Make a microfiber cloth or a lintfree piece of fabric from your
rag pile, your partner in dusting. (Read Chapter 5 for the
inside story on microfiber and its role in cleaning.)
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
194

 Skip the feather duster or any other aid that does nothing
more than move dust from one place to another, stirring up
irritants.
 As a backup — and especially if you can’t reach the ceiling —
have a vacuum cleaner with an extension on hand, too.
 If you want, you can use a cleaning product or dampen your
cleaning cloth just slightly so that more dust clings to the
cloth. (Read Chapter 6 for cleaning recipes for dusting.) But,
remember, the act of rubbing is what picks up and traps the
dust, not the cleaning solution. Spray that table all day, and
it’s not going to eat away the dust.
 Start dusting from top to bottom, moving clockwise around
the room.
 Continue to change dust cloths frequently. When one appears
to have been grayed by a film of dust and cobwebs, exchange
it for a clean one. Hey, you’re not using throwaways, but 
even though using a new cloth increases your wash load, it’s
important to have clean cloths.
 Continue moving around the room, hitting the next highest
level and then moving lower.
Attending to the details
Each section of the room and each piece of furniture deserves 
special attention. Consider this approach:
 Ceiling: With a vacuum and a long attachment, pick up the
cobwebs clinging to the ceiling corners. You can use an 
old-fashioned ceiling broom if you prefer.
 Walls: Dust walls the same way as you would the ceiling. No
direct spray is needed on the surface, but if you want to use 
a product, spray lightly into the cloth and wipe down. This
procedure is fine for both painted and wallpapered surfaces.
(If the wallpaper is special, particularly old, or hand-painted,
seek advice from experts for the best way to clean.)
 Ceiling fans, ceiling light fixtures, and floor and table
lamps: For safety, turn off the lights, lamps, and ceiling fans
before cleaning them. (Both compact fluorescent light bulbs
and LED lights emit a lot less heat.)
 Artwork and framed items: To avoid damage to unprotected
artwork if you’re using a cleaner, spray the dust cloth with the
cleaner rather than spraying it directly on the picture frame.
 Books: Again, if using a product, spray the cloth, not the item,
and use any liquid sparingly when wiping down book covers.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 195

 Mirrors and glass: You can use a microfiber cloth made
expressly for glass or opt for newspaper. A vinegar-and-water
solution or one of the other recipes in Chapter 6 works well to
capture dust on glass. (Pass up the ammonia-based commer-
cial cleaners because of their toxicity.)
 Wood furniture: If you like a little bit of polish, or even scent,
blend a few drops of a citrus essential oil and a few drops of
olive oil — you don’t need much. Dip your dust cloth in the
solution and rub furniture to a sheen.
 Plants: Use your dust cloth or take plants outside to clean.
Also, keep an eye out for moldy soil (gray on the top) and
change it. Skip the leaf-shining sprays, which may emit VOCs.
A Green Well-Lighted Space:
Windows
Rare is a living space without windows. Although I have seen 
them, a room without windows is claustrophobic and undesirable.
Home is a haven from the outside world, yes, but it’s also your
window to the world around you, whether rolling fields, dense
forest, or urban skyline.
Keeping weather out — 
and energy in
While homeowners may be influenced by style (I grew up in a
home with 60s-style picture windows; the latest trend in window
shape is tall and narrow, often grouped in twos and threes), 
energy efficiency is one of the most critical factors to consider
when greening your home. Because they’re basically holes cut 
into the walls of your home, windows let in cold or heat — and
allow energy to escape. As much as 30 percent of your heat or air
conditioning seeps out between wall and window frame. If your
windows are single-pane, you’re losing even more energy.
If you’re ready to update old, leaky windows, look for these 
features:
 A frame material that doesn’t conduct heat or cold (fiberglass
and vinyl are good, but wood is usually a greener choice).
 A well-fitted frame to reduce leakage.
 Warm edge spacers that reduce air flow and prevent 
condensation.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
196

 Double- or triple-pane windows filled with argon, krypton, or
another gas.
 Low-emissivity (low-e) coating to keep heat inside during
winter and outside in warm weather.
 Tints or films that reflect heat in warm locales.
 Low U-value, also called U-factor, which signifies how good
the window is at holding in temperature.
 Low Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), a rating of heat gain
from the sun that comes through the window.
 Energy Star ratings, as well as labels provided by the National
Fenestration Rating Council, an industry organization that
rates windows and doors.
Climate region plays an important role in choosing the right U-
factor and SHGC. For example, a low SHGC is good for warm cli-
mates, but a high SHGC is usually preferred for northern climates.
Energy Star’s site at www.efficientwindows.org/energystar.
cfm offers explanations about regional needs.
Energy-saving alternatives 
to new windows
Replacing windows isn’t cheap. If your budget doesn’t permit 
an upgrade to energy-saving windows, follow these effective 
measures:
 Cover windows with shades or drapes that block cold air and
hot sun. Both cellular shades and heavy draperies help.
 Use tinted window film to reduce solar gain in summer.
 Install awnings on south- and west-facing windows.
 Plant deciduous shade trees on the west and south sides to
keep the summer sun from beating in on those windows.
 On the north side, protect windows with an evergreen 
(don’t plant too close to the window) to slow down the cold
north wind that rushes in a leaky window.
 Use plastic sheeting over your windows to block air in cold
weather. Not pretty, but neither is a big heating bill.
 Caulk leaky window frames with foam.
If your budget permits some windows to be replaced, choose those
on the south- and west-facing sides of the house — this area is
where solar gain is the strongest.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 197

Enjoying the view: Keeping 
windows clean
A clean window is an energy-efficient window. Window sills and
frames seem to attract dirt more so than many surfaces in your
home. Dust on and around the window as you dust everything 
else in the living room, either vacuuming the loose stuff or 
hand-dusting.
Don’t forget the outside views, too. The glass and frame get dirtier,
what with the elements, car exhaust, and outdoor activity of bugs
and birds. The outside sill may require a heavy scrubbing. Arm
yourself with a stronger all-purpose cleaner and a damp sponge to
attack it.
You can keep all your glass clean with a window cleaner made of
vinegar and water. Look for this recipe and other glass cleaners in
Chapter 6.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
198
Power plants for cleaner air
One way to offset toxins in the home is to bring in more plants. Not only do growing
green plants help counter greenhouse gas emissions and help balance our planet’s
temperature in the great outdoors, even the most humble houseplants do their share
indoors to purify indoor air by absorbing toxins and boosting oxygen levels.
The most hardworking air-cleaners are leafy species, such as ferns and English ivy.
The following are good choices for countering the VOCs and other toxins that can
be emitted from carpet backing, adhesives, furniture finishes, and even computer
screens:
 Spider plants (Chlorophytum)
 Dwarf date palms (Phoenix roebelenii)
 Philodendrons (Philodendron)
 Bamboo palms (Chamaedorea seifrizii)
 Mother-in-Law’s Tongue (Sanservieria)
 Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)
 Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum)
In order to have any effect, however, you need to add multiple plants to your indoor
space: Try a dozen.

Choosing and cleaning 
drapes and blinds
When it comes to window treatments, the green home designer
faces several dilemmas: While window coverings can enhance
energy-saving efforts, they’re often made of undesirable materials
(blinds of plastic and vinyl, draperies covered with toxic fabric fin-
ishes), and many serve as a magnet for dust mites and other har-
bingers of allergy misery and respiratory woe. If you opt for
window treatments, here are a few of the greener options, along
with cleaning advice:
 Heavy draperies provide a high insulative quality, keeping the
room warm in cold weather and blocking solar gain when it’s
hot. Seek draperies made of natural, unfinished material;
linen, cotton, and some wools and silks are machine-washable,
so you can avoid the cost and chemicals associated with dry
cleaning.
 Honeycomb shades are fabric coverings that can fit snugly
within the window frame. Their cell-like construction traps 
air, which provides extra insulation. The more opaque the
shades, the better job they do of keeping out the temperature
and solar gain. The fabric may be of synthetic content and
treated with finishes that repel dust and dirt. Dust or vacuum
regularly to prevent dirt buildup. Use a damp cloth and mild
detergent for spot cleaning.
 Traditional horizontal aluminum or plastic slat blinds pro-
vide some insulation — but vertical blinds add little insulative
value. Blinds can be dusted and vacuumed. Special brushes
with “fingers” are available, though far from necessary to do a
good cleaning job. Clean with damp cloth and mild solution or
remove the entire assembly and stick in the bathtub.
 Indoor shutters and blinds made of wood are better for
blocking heat than for lending insulation value. Clean 
wood or bamboo blinds or shutters as you do other wood 
furniture: Simply dust with a dry or slightly damp cloth or use
a wood cleaner.
Warming Up to Fireplaces
For most people, the “white picket fence” dream home includes 
a fireplace. Even folks in sun-blessed states such as Arizona 
and Florida often picture a fireplace when they envision the 
perfect home.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 199

Without a doubt, a fireplace evokes a cozy, homey feeling. But the
practicalities of maintaining and using a fireplace offer a dose of
reality that can darken the dream image. Interestingly, most
owners, on average, use the fireplace just 1 percent of the time.
Despite infrequent use in many cases, fireplaces are clearly worth
the trouble to the multitudes of owners. But the tribulations are
nonetheless important to acknowledge for best care and use.
Safety first: Fireproofing 
the fireplace
The first issue to address when operating your fireplace is safety.
Whenever you have an open fire source, the risks of house fires
and injury increase. Also, be aware that wood smoke is an 
irritant that can be as bad for respiratory conditions as any other
VOC-emitting source in your home. Burning wood releases 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and VOCs, so be sure the room
is well-ventilated before starting a fire.
For safe evenings before a crackling fire, take these steps:
 Install a smoke alarm and make sure that it’s working.
 Keep the chimney clean from dangerous creosote buildup,
which can lead to house fires.
 Have the chimney inspected and cleaned at least once a year.
 Burn only seasoned wood — split wood should be allowed to
dry out for six months; never use painted or treated wood,
colored paper, garbage, plastic, or other refuse.
 When a fire is burning, always block the fireplace with 
a mesh screen.
 If smoke begins to fill the room, open windows and doors to
ventilate, and get people, especially children and the elderly,
out of the house; then take steps to put out the fire.
 Don’t build a fire that’s too big for the fireplace.
How green is my fireplace?
Burning wood also releases carbon dioxide (CO2), the same green-
house gas that results from the burning of fossil fuels. But when
firewood comes from forests following sustainable practices and 
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
200

is used in a sustainable manner, you can argue that the burning of
the wood produces no more CO2 than if it were decomposing in the
forest. But a lot of other factors come into play, as the rotting wood
provides food for insects and the soil. Bottom line: Burning wood
in your fireplace has an ecological price tag.
The next hurdle is that fireplaces are another hole in your home
from which energy escapes when not in use — from your furnace
in winter and air-conditioned air in the summer. To aggravate mat-
ters, when in use, the fireplace loses up to 90 percent of its heat up
the chimney!
Best bet if you insist that a home is not a home without a fireplace:
Opt for an advanced-combustion fireplace, which burns less 
wood and produces less smoke. Or install an energy-efficient gas
fireplace insert — still not as efficient as a gas furnace, but 
dramatically greener than a traditional fireplace.
If you must live with an existing fireplace, follow this advice for
maximizing energy use:
 Keep the damper closed when the fireplace isn’t in use. This
tactic alone can reduce your home’s energy loss by 8 percent.
 When not in use, a well-fitted cover or glass door reduces air
loss through the fireplace and chimney.
 Use seasoned wood from your own property or buy properly
seasoned firewood from a sustainably managed source.
 If you don’t plan to use your fireplace, take steps to close up
the chimney to prevent air from escaping. Balloon-like devices
that block air flow are available for $40 to $60.
Cleaning the fireplace: 
Ashes to ashes
If you’re like my parents, who lived in their home 14 years without
ever lighting a fire in their fireplace, you may never need to do
more than an occasional dusting of the inside of your fireplace. But
the more a fireplace is used, the more soot and ash it produces.
And because the material can drift like dust into other areas of
your home, you want to keep on top of it.
Cleaning out a place that contains frequent fires requires caution,
however. Avoid cleaning out the fireplace if a fire has burned
recently. When you’re ready for a seasonal clean, get ready for one
dirty job and follow these steps:
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 201

1. Make sure the fire is completely out before you attempt
to clean it.
Wait two days after the last use.
2. Close windows and doors to prevent any drafts from
blowing around the ashes and soot.
3. Don an apron or work shirt, eye goggles, gloves, and a
mask to avoid getting stirred-up ashes in your eyes or
breathing passages.
4. Using your fireplace tool or another scoop, shovel all the
ashes into a bucket.
Carry the bucket outside before dumping to minimize 
floating soot. (Wood ash may be a great addition to 
your compost pile if your soil leans toward the acidic end
of the pH spectrum.)
5. Vacuum the remaining ash in the fireplace.
Never vacuum within two days of burning a fire in the 
fireplace, or attempt to vacuum all the ash. Most vacuums
aren’t capable of handling that volume of debris. Be aware
of outdoor conditions and warnings from fire departments
of extremely dry conditions.
6. (Optional) If you want to take it to the next level, you can
wash out the fireplace with water and a mild soap.
On the walls outside the fireplace, brick can take a tougher
scrubbing than adobe and stucco, or wallboard, which can
be treated as you would your interior walls. With most
stone, marble, slate, tile, and cement — baking soda and
water is a safe choice.
7. Clean the grates, irons, and fireplace accessories.
Like grilling tools, you can take the fireplace accessories
outside and hose them down with soap and water or an 
all-purpose cleaner. If your accessories are brass, polish
them with a solution of lemon juice, baking soda, and 
water and dry with a soft cloth.
Hiring a chimney sweep to clean out the inside of your chimney is
important. Let the experts thoroughly — and safely — clean out
your fireplace and rest assured that dangerous buildup inside the
chimney has been cleared away. Choose a professional certified by
The Chimney Safety Institute of America (www.csia.org).

Turning On to Living 
Room Electronics
Depending on a family’s recreational interests, the living room may
be packed with electronics: In addition to the TV-DVD-VCR setup,
the living area may house sophisticated entertainment centers and
music systems, and computers and computer game stations, not to
mention the usual plug-ins such as phones and clock-radios.
Plugging the energy drain
While most of these electronics together may not pull as much
energy as the refrigerator or clothes dryer alone, they can still hike
up the monthly utility bill significantly. Efforts to reduce the energy
drain put money back in your pocket.
One of the best — and most obvious — pieces of advice is to turn
stuff off. No one’s watching the TV? Click it off. Everyone’s left the
house? Stop the CD from crooning to an empty room. Time for
dinner? Tell the kids to turn off the computer.
But some of these electronics continue to pull energy even in 
off-mode. Anything operated by a remote, and machines that
include clocks and rechargers, can add up to 8 percent more to
your annual utility bill — even when turned off. Why? Such 
devices continue to drink in electricity to be prepared to boot up
fast when turned on. Keep a cell-phone recharger plugged in, for
example, and it uses two-thirds the energy it does when charging
your phone.
Chapter 11: Greening and Cleaning the Living Room 203
A case for the gas fireplace
Installing a gas insert into your existing fireplace may be the greenest solution that
allows you the luxury of a cozy home hearth, with much better (90 percent) energy
efficiency. The steel or cast-iron insert holds gas logs, and the units turn on with
the flip of a switch — say “goodbye” to chopping or buying firewood.
Safety precautions are as important with gas-insert fireplaces as with wood-
burning ones: Have a professional install it and maintain it regularly as you would
your gas furnace.
Happily, cleaning a gas fireplace is much easier than the traditional wood-stoked
version: Simply turn off the power to the fireplace and let it cool, and then remove
the gas logs and burner and brush them off outside. You can vacuum the inside of
the fireplace, replace the burner and logs, and you’re good to go.

The solution: Unplug it! Doing so may add time for your TV to
warm up, your computer to boot up, or your phone to recharge,
but you reduce the overall energy consumption by doing so.
To keep from making the rounds daily to unplug as many as a
couple dozen devices, plug your electronics into power strips.
Then you simply have to switch the power strip off, and the energy
drain is halted. Also available for computer peripherals (printers
and scanners) is a smart strip that senses when these devices
aren’t in use and stops the energy flow to them.
Keeping electronics dust-free
Dust is a detriment to electronics: Just look at what happens when
you get a bit of dust stuck on a DVD or CD. When cleaning your
living room, you can dust electronics the same as you dust other
furniture and items. But leave out the fluid cleaners and water.
Most electronics cleaners — including computer monitor sprays
and DVD cleaners — contain elements that you’d prefer not to
spray in your home if you’re concerned about indoor air quality.
The problem is, you don’t have many options for cleaning 
stuck-on gunk.
Start with a purpose-designed microfiber cloth or other cloth. You
can find these in office supply and electronics stores. Sometimes a
good rub-down does the trick. If not, you may have to resort to the
cleaner. To reduce your environmental impact, try to use a
reusable cloth rather than a disposable, single-use wipe.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
204
Choosing electronics for lower energy use
Some models, sizes, and styles of electronics use less energy than others, so if
you’re in the market for upgrading your computer, or are ready to buy a digital TV,
consider these factors:
 Opt for a laptop computer over a desktop.
 Choose LCD (liquid crystal display) TVs and computer monitors over CRT (cath-
ode ray tube) models.
 Check to see if your device is Energy Star–rated (www.energystar.gov).
 The smaller the model, the less energy it uses (usually).

Here are some more tips for cleaning electronic equipment:
 Turn off computer and TV monitors before cleaning.
 Avoid using water or excess liquid cleaner on electronics.
 Gently brush away loose dust before wiping a monitor to
scrub off gunk, lest you scratch the screen by scrubbing in a
hard piece of dirt.
 Clean LCD monitors with more care than glass-front CRT 
monitors. They can be scratched or damaged more easily. Use
a soft cloth and, if necessary, a purpose-made spray.
 Unless otherwise advised by the manufacturer, gentle green
solutions, such as vinegar and water, are probably fine for
most electronics.
 Most cleaning products recommended by manufacturers
aren’t likely to be green. Some even come in aerosol cans. But
unless you can verify that another cleaning solution can be
substituted, it may be best to stick to the recommendation.
 Computer keyboards seem to collect a lot of crumbs: While
the computer is off, turn the keyboard over and shake the
loose debris out. An old toothbrush or a cleaned and dried
old mascara wand gets between the keys to remove whatever
hasn’t shaken out.
Speed Cleaning: What You Can 
Do in Less than 15 Minutes
Because the living room is so, well, lived in, this popular guest-
entertaining space typically suffers the most day-to-day mess. The
area within watching distance of the TV is especially vulnerable, as
snack crumbs and drink glasses collect on the coffee table, pillows
get scrunched, and socks often end up stuck in the crevices of the
couch. Fortunately, a quick whisk-through just picking up stuff can
usually transform the place back to a respectable state.
 Pick up newspapers, magazines, and glasses and dishes.
 Clean off tables, dust, and rearrange lamps and remotes.
 Straighten couch pillows and throws.
 Quickly vacuum or dry mop floors.
 Adjust window blinds, shutters, and drapes.

F
ace it: Your living space doesn’t stop at the doors of your
home. Although you and the others you live with may spend
most of their time indoors, your garage and the transitional pas-
sages that connect to your outdoor space require cleaning atten-
tion, as well.
In this chapter, I cover transitional areas, such as foyers or entry-
ways off the front door, mudrooms connected to the garage, and
informal four-season patios or sunrooms that open to the back-
yard. I also cover that humble space that shelters the family auto-
mobile but that seems to end up housing not only lawn-care
equipment and the garbage can, but all the extra items that get
shoved out of the living areas to free up space — or to make space
for more new stuff.
Making a Green Entrance
Whether you enter from the formal front door, sneak in the side
entrance or garage into the mudroom, or track through a sunroom

from the backyard, your home’s entry points connect your inside
space to your outside space — which means that one way or
another, plenty of dirt gets tracked in. But each transitional area is
used in different ways and demands unique attention.
Crossing the energy threshold: Doors
According to feng shui principles, the entrance to the home is aus-
picious — it’s where vital life energy, chi, enters and exits, and
where you move between your inner and outer realms. Feng shui
experts advise that an attractive and well-kept front door ensures
that the world perceives you in a positive way and attracts positive
energy. (For more on feng shui, see Feng Shui For Dummies [Wiley]
by David Daniel Kennedy.)
In addition, the doors to your home must make you feel secure and
keep you safe from the elements. Most likely, your outer doors are
made of wood, wood composites, vinyl, metal, or fiberglass. But
more important than how they look is how they perform at sealing
up your home envelope. With all the in-and-out traffic your home’s
entrances likely endure, a lot of energy escapes. But when closed,
they ought to make as tight a seal as possible.
Which door in your home sees the most traffic? Whether front, back,
or side, give this entrance special attention in terms of weather-
proofing. Make sure that the door shuts easily and properly and
adjust as necessary to stop the energy leaks. (For more on keeping
out cold air, see the sidebar “Warming up to insulation value.”)
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
208
Warming up to insulation value
The R-value is the measure of your door’s ability to insulate. The higher the R-value,
the better the job at keeping out cold air in winter and heat in summer. Most doors,
depending upon the materials, offer an R-value of anywhere from 1.8 to 3. (Some
metal insulated doors can offer values as high as 7 or 14.)
Until you’re prepared to replace your door, you’re stuck with the R-value you have.
But you can still reduce the leaks in your home envelope by adding weatherstrip-
ping around the door and caulking gaps and cracks.
Sliding glass doors present other energy issues. Well-fitted, double- or triple-pane
glass or a low-emissivity (low-E) coating helps up the R-value. (Chapter 11 looks
into the ins and outs of windows.) Add another layer of insulation with heavy
draperies.

Cleaning your home’s doors is a half-inside, half-outside job. The out-
side work requires, no surprise, a little more elbow grease as it gets
battered with rain, mud, pet paw prints, and the occasional kick from
an impatient kid. Unless the manufacturer specifies some unusual
cleaning procedure, you can almost always handle the job — inside
and out — with a basic all-purpose spray and a cleaning rag.
A storm door reduces the need to clean your entry door. You can
clean storm and sliding glass doors as you would any window, with
a little vinegar and a lintfree cloth, newspaper, or squeegee.
Wash the glass on a cloudy day to reduce streaking. (Sun dries the
solution faster than you can buff it in.) For windows that have been
cleaned with commercial window solutions, you may need to mix
in a little liquid detergent with your vinegar and water to cut the
buildup. (See Chapter 6 to find green glass-cleaning recipes.)
Putting out the welcome mat
The welcome mat is more than an expression of hospitality to
guests. Doormats inside and outside the entry doors save cleaning
time. Mats on the outside of the door are typically of a more
rugged material, often a bristly brushlike texture that’s great for
catching grass, mud, and other gunk you don’t want tracked into
your home.
A boot scraper — a heavy iron-and-brush, doorstop-like device —
provides an extra way to give mud the boot. Place one to the side
of your entrance, especially if your home’s inhabitants garden,
work, or play in the yard.
Inside doormats don’t have to work as hard as the outdoor mats,
unless you have kids, spouses, or friends who have to be reminded
to wipe their feet. For both inside and outside, doormats come in
several ecomaterials:
 Coir mats are made from coconut husk fiber. These thickly
woven mats are extremely durable and repel insects naturally.
They’re not recommended for outdoors, however, unless used
on a well-covered porch. Because most are from India, you
need to consider the energy cost. But if you choose to use,
buy from a Fair Trade certified company, which ascertains that
the product was made under humane work conditions. Coir
mats are available in most home stores and sell for as little as
$15, though they can cost $50 and up to more than $100.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 209

 Flip flop doormats are made from — you guessed it — recy-
cled rubber flip-flop material. (I’m talking about the scraps on
the manufacturing floor — no, there isn’t yet a recycling drop-
off for your old flip-flops). They’re available through many
sources online and start at $20. Simply wash them down with
a hose whenever called for.
 Rubber doormats are made from recycled car tires. Some of
these brands are manufactured in the United States, so you’re
not adding as much to the energy cost of the doormat as one
created abroad. Mats range in price, anywhere from $25 to
more than $100, based on size.
 Jute, seagrass, sisal, and hemp rugs are sold through environ-
mentally oriented catalog companies, as well as some of the big
box and home stores. Just shake them to loosen soil, vacuum,
and wipe clean with a damp sponge. Expect to find these mats
in the $30-and-up range, though they’re sometimes less.
Putting Transitional 
Rooms to Work
The spaces connected to the home’s entryways often have differ-
ent purposes, but they all “transition” you from the outside to the
living areas of the home. Other than providing a pit stop to remove
outer wear or drop off keys and mail, these rooms typically don’t
see as much activity as, say, the living room or kitchen.
An energy-saving value of transitional spaces: They provide further
distance between the elements (outside) and the part of the house
you want to keep warmest — or coolest.
Keep the doors to rooms you’re not using closed. Although the
rooms will be colder or warmer than the rest of the house, depend-
ing on the time of year, their buffering keeps the living areas more
comfortable and you’ll waste less energy.
Transition rooms may demand a lot more cleaning action than
some of your more lived-in spaces. These spaces are the first line
of defense against invaders with mud, grass, leaves, car oil, gum,
sludge, and whatever other unmentionably disgusting crud that
may be on the bottoms of their shoes.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
210

Be prepared to tackle these floors with frequent sweepings and
moppings. You’re apt to appreciate an easy-to-wash, hard-surface
floor in any transition room. (For the care and cleaning of hard
floor materials, turn to Chapter 11.) In addition to the doormats,
both inside and out, a boot and shoe tray stationed near the
entrance can also help cut down on dirty foot traffic.
The point of entry, in large part, defines the transition room. For
example, the door at which company rings the bell tends to be the
formal front entrance. An entrance from the garage likely leads to
the mudroom. And the entrance from the backyard often leads to a
sun or garden room.
Front entrance: Providing 
a formal welcome
The front door most often opens into an entry area, a place where
guests are formally greeted. If your family is like most, you use this
door less frequently, especially if you have a garage that attaches
to another entrance. Good news: You’re less likely to bring in the
day-to-day grime through your home’s most formal entrance. You
have an easier time keeping this space in good, first-impression
condition.
Keeping your entryway uncluttered is a way to make it welcoming
and functional. If you don’t have a big closet in that area, a coat
rack and umbrella stand make attractive and practical touches.
Don’t forget a small table to hold keys and mail. Finish with a
favorite piece of art, a mirror, and a potted plant.
Mudrooms: Dishing the family dirt
I love mudrooms because they serve so many purposes.
Northerners use them for removing boots and heavy jackets;
Southerners have their share of raincoats and outer shoes, like gar-
dening clogs. Everyone can use them for hanging up hats and
housing pet food stations and cat litter boxes.
Because it’s attached to the garage or a side or back door, the mud-
room is likely to see more dirt than the front entryway. (It’s not
called a mudroom for nothing.) That the mudroom frequently
shares space with the laundry operations works out well for toss-
ing dirty outerwear in the wash.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 211

Sunrooms: A room for all seasons
Often, a back door opens into an extra living space, one that’s typi-
cally more casual than the living room. This space may be lined
with windows to take in a backyard view. Some folks may use the
room as an auxiliary family room, calling it a four-season room, a
sitting room, or a sunroom.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
212
Is your cat turning you into a litterbug?
Next to humans, domestic cats — say many experts — stamp one of the biggest
carbon paw prints on the planet: Not only does their food frequently come in small-
portion cans and bags that create more waste, felines with access to the great sub-
urban outdoors wreak havoc on local birdlife. But the biggest environmental demerit
is buried in their litter boxes.
Most cat litter is made from clay, a material that requires energy-intense and
destructive strip mining to extract. The clay dust particles can also irritate respira-
tory conditions. Silica gel litters eliminate the dust problem and absorb (“clump”)
well, but they pose a risk to your pet’s health as cats (and dogs) may inadvertently
digest the silica pearls, which can expand in their systems and kill them.
Litters composed of materials such as wheat, corn, pine, and even recycled news-
paper have a lighter environmental impact, as byproducts of other processes.
Additionally, they biodegrade rather quickly. Many cat owners claim that they don’t
all absorb odors as well as clay or silica-based litters, and some finicky cats turn up
their noses at them.
But here’s the biggest rub: Even if the litter is rapidly biodegradable, you don’t have
many viable options for disposing of it. Because cat feces may carry toxoplasmo-
sis parasites, cat owners are advised against dumping cat litter outside — espe-
cially near water sources or in areas that humans or other pets may come into
contact with.
Flushing litter is also a bad idea, even when the manufacturer advertises that it’s
flushable. The wastewater treatment process in your community may not kill the
parasites. With more news about pharmaceuticals contaminating water systems,
this risk of litter contaminants is a concern, too. (Ironically, one of the solutions
recently posed for getting rid of medicines safely is to pour them into used cat litter.)
Check with your local wastewater treatment facility to see whether it advises flush-
ing litter. Don’t dump litter in your yard — and by no means should you put it in your
compost! The sad fact is, you may not have any viable option but to wrap it up and
put it in the trash.

With sunrooms, green and cleaning issues are the same as those
for other living areas in the home, from choosing ecoconscious
flooring and furnishings to cleaning in a natural and energy-smart
way. (Review Chapter 11 for the ins and outs of cleaning living
spaces.)
The only time a sunroom may not be treated as a living area is if
it’s not centrally cooled or heated. Then, this space is typically
used only at pleasant times of the year; the rest of the year, it’s
either closed off to conserve energy or avoided because it’s too
hot or too cold. Like the mudroom, however, the room can still
play a role in buffering your living areas from the elements.
Defusing Garage Hazards
The detached garage presents benefits to the ecominded home-
owner. Not only does your home suffer less from heat loss with the
constant raising and lowering of the garage door, keeping the
garage away from the house means that unhealthy emissions from
your vehicles aren’t drifting into your living area.
Your car is a huge source of carbon emissions, but your garage —
detached or otherwise — contains other toxic, explosive, and flam-
mable substances and devices. That these hazards are multiplied
when gasoline-fueled vehicles and appliances stand side by side
with combustible chemicals — and exacerbated in an environment
that most often is not heated or cooled — may make you question
the wisdom of ever starting up your car inside that place.
Avoiding carbon monoxide threats
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is, of course, the greenhouse gas that has the
world in alarm at its escalating impact on climate. But carbon
monoxide (CO) is devastating in a different way. This colorless, vir-
tually odorless gas is caused when fuel-burning devices — fur-
naces, generators, space heaters, and cars, among others —
operate improperly. Inhaling CO disrupts the oxygen process,
restricting blood flow and causing dizziness, shortness of breath,
flu-like symptoms, and, at high enough doses, death.
Starting your car in an enclosed garage is dangerous, as CO from
exhaust can build up in a short time. And you don’t have to be in the
garage to be at risk — this gas can enter your home and accumulate
in small spaces and rooms, posing as great a threat to your safety.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 213

You can reduce your risk of CO poisoning by taking these 
precautions:
 Install a CO monitor in your home, one for every level of the
house. Be sure to check regularly to make sure the batteries
are working.
 Never operate a grill — charcoal, gas, or propane — inside the
garage.
 Start up lawn mowers and any gasoline-powered equipment
outside of the garage and allow the machines to “rest” outside
for some time before you store them when you’re done.
 Don’t warm up your car in the garage. Start it and pull imme-
diately out of the garage. You don’t need to let it run — and
waste fuel — for several minutes before you drive. According
to the U.S. Department of Energy, the best way to warm up
your car engine is to drive it. Even on a winter day, you
shouldn’t need more than 30 seconds before putting it in gear.
Storing chemicals safely
Antifreeze, bug spray, weedkiller, paint thinner, propane, gasoline:
Your garage holds a veritable alphabet soup of chemical sub-
stances that add up to spell danger, especially when stored closely
together. Aerosols, canisters, cans, and boxes with notices, such as
WARNING, FLAMMABLE, DANGER, POISON, CORROSIVE, and COM-
BUSTIBLE, demand special precautions, even when not in use.
Of course, when you reduce the use of environmentally harmful
chemicals in your home and on your lawn and garden, you erase
some of this risk. But chances are your garage holds some danger-
ous substances even after you do a green-clean purge. The best
safety measure is to store such materials safely and responsibly.
Consider these suggestions:
 Make sure that the garage is well ventilated.
 Don’t keep chemicals and products that are old, unnecessary,
or out of date. Discard responsibly by delivering the sub-
stances to a community tox drop to make sure that they’re
disposed of safely. (For information about your nearest tox
drop, visit http://earth911.org.)
 Store all substances in their original, well-sealed containers to
ensure that the chemicals are properly labeled in a vessel
designed to safely hold them. (Some substances are so corro-
sive that they can eat through many materials.)
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
214

 You’re safer not to keep containers of gasoline in your garage
or anywhere else on your property. If you must keep gasoline
there, be sure to store it in an approved container — which
holds no more than five gallons — with a vapor-proof cap.
Don’t store anywhere near a pilot light.
 Keep chemicals away from direct sunlight, locked in a cabinet
inaccessible to children and pets. Don’t store them near toys
or pet food.
 Keep combustible products away from any appliance (such as
your furnace or water heater) or any device with a pilot light.
 Don’t open or use chemicals in the garage. But if you must, be
sure you have plenty of ventilation.
 Don’t store propane tanks in the garage. It’s okay to bring in
the grill, but the propane bottles belong at least 10 feet 
from the house.
Preventing accidents
What with all the power tools, hardware, ladders, lawn mowers, and
other machines, the garage is an accident waiting to happen. One of
the biggest causes of accidents in the garage is poor lighting.
Consider updating your lighting by adding energy-efficient fluores-
cents overhead and above work areas. Who cares if the place is lit
up like a football stadium? The last thing you want when revving
up the circular saw is mood lighting.
Other safety moves for the garage include the following:
 Update an old garage door. Be sure your overhead door
button is up to date, with an auto-reverse feature: When any-
thing from a basketball to a pet is in the door’s path as it’s
closing, the door stops and reverses.
Test this feature regularly: Place a two-by-four piece of wood or
some other object under the door. When the descending door
hits the object, if it doesn’t reverse, call a trained professional
and get it repaired immediately. Don’t try to fix it yourself.
 Hang up your ladder. Either stack the ladder against the wall
horizontally or hang it on strong hooks on the ceiling. Ladders
left vertically against the wall pose the greatest risk — they
can easily come crashing down on your car or you. They’re
also terribly tempting to children.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 215

 Make your garage electricity-safe. Limited outlets in the
garage often find homeowners plugging into extension cords,
raising the risk of tripping as well as shock from wires in
frayed condition. Be sure your garage circuits are protected
with a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) to prevent
shock. Always keep all electrical devices away from water and
unplug devices when not in use.
 Eliminate clutter. A garage packed with piles of junk makes a
good home for mice and other vermin. Do away with the pos-
session overflow and reduce your risks of tripping, being hit
by poorly stored items, or creating a fire hazard.
Organizing a Functional Garage
Garages may be traditionally used for lawn tools and storage of
rarely used household items, but don’t let that be a license to accu-
mulate clutter. Take steps to rid yourself of unwanted and danger-
ous clutter and transform your garage into a spacious, open, tidy,
organized space.
Shaking out the junk: 
Reduce and recycle
“Simplify, simplify,” said Henry David Thoreau, America’s first
advocate of voluntary simplicity. He didn’t have a garage, but if he
had, he might have escaped to Walden Pond even earlier.
Fortunately, you don’t have to run away to the woods to simplify
the state of your garage. In fact, home and garage organization is
big business: Some companies specialize in doing the dirty work
for you — a full-out garage redo with elaborate storage systems
can cost upward to $10,000.
Or you can sort through the years of accumulation yourself and
discover there really is room for a car or two in your two-car
garage. The first step of your do-it-yourself overhaul is to clear out
everything from the garage and determine what stays and what
goes. Some decisions may be easy (you didn’t know you still had a
treadmill); others may be tough (hard to let go of the rocking chair
that saw you through long nights soothing fussy babies).
But if the stuff’s been gathering cobwebs for a decade or two, how
much value is it giving you? Wouldn’t it be better for someone else
to get some use out of it? And if it’s a beloved family treasure, isn’t
it time to pass it on to the next generation? It’s time for some
garage sale wisdom: If you love it, let it go. And, remember, sim-
plify, simplify.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
216

The last thing you want to do is to fill up a dumpster of throwaway
stuff. Challenge yourself to not only get rid of all the unused items
in your garage, but to reuse or recycle everything you can.
Passing your possessions on
Identify all the stuff that’s in good, workable condition: coffee
makers, yard tools, kids’ bikes, exercise equipment. You have a 
few alternatives for ridding yourself of these underappreciated
possessions:
 Keep it close to home. Set aside those items for which you
have a recipient in mind: Your nephews may enjoy the basket-
ball hoop; a neighbor may like that extra hose.
 Have a garage sale. Compensate yourself for all your hard
work and make a little profit from your efforts.
 Sell or give it away online. Post your items on the electronic
classifieds. You can sell through your local newspaper, as well
as through services such as Craig’s List
(www.craigslist.org) and eBay (www.ebay.com). And you
can give it away through FreeCycle (www.freecycle.org).
 Donate construction materials. Habitat for Humanity runs
“ReStores” in many communities. They accept half-full cans of
paint, plywood, plumbing and light fixtures, furnishings,
doors, shutters, storm windows, and virtually anything that
may be used in home building. Visit www.habitat.org/
env/restores.aspx to find the nearest ReStore to you.
 Call a charity. If you have a big enough haul, most not-for-
profits that accept household goods donations, such as
AmVets, Salvation Army, and Goodwill, do pickups. Other
local services may also provide a pickup service.
All the junk that’s fit to recycle
Now, what was it you planned to do with that collection of empty
wine bottles? Whether it’s a project that once seemed like a bril-
liant idea or a bunch of “junk” that you somehow inherited, you’re
bound to uncover all sorts of stuff in your garage that has no value
to family, neighbors, donation recipients — or you. In these situa-
tions, recycle whatever you can.
You can deliver many items — newspaper, magazines, glass bot-
tles, plastics, and aluminum — to a recycling drop-off site, or per-
haps your own curbside service picks up some of these materials.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 217

Other items may not, at first blush, seem recyclable. But think
twice before you relegate these to the junk heap:
 Appliances, tools, hardware, and other metals
 Motor oil
 Packing peanuts and bubble wrap
 Tires
 Household appliances and electronics
For information about recycling sources in your community, check
online at Earth 911 at http://earth911.org. (Flip to Chapter 7
for details on setting up a recycling center in your home.)
Trashing the remainder
After you’ve winnowed out all the items you can give away, repur-
pose, or recycle, you’re likely to have reduced your true throw-
away pile to a fraction-of-a-dumpster-sized load.
Don’t toss dangerous substances and hazardous materials: rat poi-
sons, pest-control sprays, weedkillers, antifreeze, mercury, lead,
batteries, compact fluorescent light bulbs, paint thinner, lubricants,
caulk, degreasers, spray paint, water sealant, turpentine, and min-
eral spirits, to name a few! Rather than relegate these items to a
landfill where they leach into the soil and cause environmental
damage, deliver them to a tox drop in your community. (Refer to
Earth 911’s Web site at http://earth911.org for locations.)
Setting up an efficient 
storage system
To avoid having your garage turn back into the black hole of neg-
lected possessions, implement an easy and logical organization. Start
by grouping like items together: yard and garden tools in one place;
hardware and tools in another; sports equipment in one corner; and
rarely needed items in the remotest recesses of your garage.
Also, consider which possessions you want in “deep” storage and
which you need readily accessible:
 Are they active items, ones used as frequently as weekly?
 Are they seasonal items — the box of holiday lights and deco-
rations — that make an appearance on a yearly basis?
 Or are they relegated to deep storage — likely never to see
the light of day until your adult kids finally get a place of their
own and reclaim their high school DVD (or album) collection.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
218

Old photo albums, saved letters, baby books, and precious family
keepsakes are best stored in climate-controlled spaces, somewhere
other than the garage, which is notorious for heat and dampness.
At the very least, store such items in some sort of impenetrable
container — not in cardboard or a wooden trunk. One family I
knew of had to throw out several crates of books and children’s
school papers, literally eaten through by mold, mice, and moths.
Next, assess the space you have available. Keep in mind the pri-
mary purpose for your garage: to store your car. So design a space
that allows plenty of room for your car or cars and enough space
to maneuver in and out with grocery bags.
Arrange your garage so that you get as much off the floor as possi-
ble. In addition to built-in cabinets and attic space above the
garage, your walls and ceilings are your best bets for storage areas.
Maximize these areas through the creative installation of storage
systems and helpful hardware:
 Ceiling hooks are a great way to get bicycles off the floor.
 Stand-alone cabinets are perfect for materials you want to keep
free of dust or sun exposure (if your garage has windows).
 Counters, under-counter storage, or tables can hold trash and
trash bags, recycling bins, bulbs, dry pet food, toys, and more.
 Drawers, stackable bins, and under-shelf baskets are useful
for small objects, such as nails and screws, plant labels, pens,
and string.
 Shelving units or wall shelves provide storage opportunities;
use higher shelves for lighter-weight items, such as empty
buckets and watering cans, and lower shelves for heavier
objects.
 Pegboards and hooks work well for keeping hammers, pliers,
garden shovels, pruners, and scissors in sight; getting
brooms, mops, shovels, rakes, and other long-handled devices
off the floor, as well as keeping rope, wire, and electric cords
in tidy bundles.
While you’re identifying garage articles for reuse or recycling, con-
sider furniture pieces that you can repurpose for garage organiza-
tion purposes. Old kitchen cabinets or a computer workstation
may work for storage.

The ins and outs of 
garage housekeeping
I may be a committed housekeeper, but I draw the line at polishing
the water heater and washing the garden tools. I remember my
grandparents couldn’t bring themselves to park their car in the
garage after they painted the floor. Not me!
That said, the occasional scrub-down of garage space is warranted.
After all, with its routine exposure to the great outdoors and the
trailing in of fuel, car oil, leaves, asphalt, gravel, and other grime,
the garage can get pretty dirty. You decide what schedule works
for you, though, whether a monthly sweep-through or a seasonal
overhaul.
When you’re ready to tackle the job, keep these steps in mind:
1. Move all objects on the floor — your car, the lawn mower,
and so on — outside before you dive into cleaning.
2. Grab a broom and sweep down spider webs from the
ceilings and walls.
3. Wipe down the walls and shelves with a dry rag.
Don’t get drywall wet.
4. With a large push broom, sweep up loose leaves and dirt.
If free of car oil, auto fluids, or other spilled chemicals,
scoop up the pile for your compost heap.
5. Wash down concrete floors using a bucket of water — or
hose down just enough to wet the floor — and then
simply sweep dry with a big push broom.
6. Scrub out stains and built-up gunk and rinse with buckets
of water or the hose, making sure to get debris out of the
corners.
Take it up a notch by using a bucket of nonpetroleum, rap-
idly biodegradable soap and water.
7. Let the floor air-dry.
Properly built garage floors are on a slight angle, so water
flows outside, or they may contain a drain in the middle of
the floor.

Caring for the Garage’s 
Primary Tenant
Americans are the People of the Car; the lifeblood of the nation has
been its vascular system of highways and interstates. Within one
century, the automobile has become part of the American way, a
reflection of collective independence.
But with spiraling gas prices putting the pinch on family finances,
car owners across the country are seeking ways to become less
dependent on their cars and, in the process, reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.
Keeping your car’s exterior 
resale-ready
A clean and spotless automobile means better resale value of your
car. Keeping the exterior clean protects the paint job: Substances
such as road salt, sand, tar, saltwater, asphalt — even tree sap and
bird droppings — can eat away at the paint, leaving you to battle
with rust.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 221
Maintaining an energy-efficient car
You don’t have to own a hybrid to increase your energy efficiency when driving.
Whether you park a Prius or an SUV in your garage, adhering to attentive mainte-
nance and these fuel-saving driving practices means your car lasts longer, runs
better, and gets more mileage:
 Stick to the speed limit. (And on highways, max out at 55 mph to achieve the
most efficient gas mileage. Above 60 mph, fuel efficiency plummets.)
 Keep your tires properly inflated.
 Service your car routinely, changing the oil, replacing the air filter, and 
maintaining fluids.
 Follow the driving guidelines in your owner’s manual.
 Maintain a steady speed, shift gears smoothly, and slow down, speed up, and
come to a stop gently.
For more tips on cutting down on fuel consumption by reducing the use of your car,
turn to Chapter 14. Also read Green Living For Dummies (Wiley) by Yvonne Jeffery,
Liz Barclay, and Michael Grosvenor.

Take these additional steps to protect your car’s exterior:
 Watch where you park. Debris from trees, including sap and
fruit, and bird droppings can damage your car’s paint job.
When I left the office one afternoon, I learned why no one had
taken what I considered to be a primo parking spot under a
tree. The locals knew that particular tree was filled with ripe,
red berries, a favorite of birds. In one day, my white car
looked like a war zone.
 Skip road salt as a de-icer. The road salt sprinkled on winter
roads is extremely corrosive to your car’s underside and the
exterior, where it routinely ends up — I won’t even get into the
environmental damage it can do to the soil and groundwater.
Rather than pouring salt on the ice and snow in your driveway,
you’re doing your car and the Earth a favor by using sand. It
doesn’t melt the ice, but it does provide some traction.
 Keep your car covered. Always park your car in the garage
when you’re home rather than leaving it out in the elements.
Sunlight, while great for drying clothes out on the line, is too
harsh on a car’s finish.
The greenest way to clean your car
Many car owners searching for green cleaning options are surprised
to learn that the professional conveyor-belt car wash is a more eco-
friendly choice than the do-it-yourself wash (see the next section).
Here’s why:
 Car wash services use less water to clean your car than you
do when you wash it at home. According to the International
Car Wash Association, the average amount of fresh water used
on a conveyor wash is 34 gallons. A self-service wash, in
which you pay for a certain amount of water and soap dis-
pensed in controlled amounts, is even less. A do-it-yourself
wash with a garden hose, on the other hand, can use more
than 100 gallons of water.
 Federal law requires commercial car washes to divert their
wastewater into the sewer system — when you wash your car
in the driveway, that soapy water contaminated with exhaust
and auto fluids pours into storm sewers and washes out into
the environment.
 Some car washes may recycle and reuse rinse water, reducing
water use even further.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
222

Washing your car at home
You may use more than 100 gallons of water as you spray down your
auto, suds it up, and then rinse it while the hose continues to run.
On top of that, the cleaning agent you use may include harmful
chemicals, which mix with the grime, oil, and exhaust residue
washed from the car into community waterways. These harsh
cleaners can also degrade the rubber seals around your windows
and affect the window tinting over repeated use.
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you can reduce the eco-impact of your
effort by following this process:
1. Park the car in the grass, under some shade.
Water that runs off the vehicle is absorbed into the ground —
all the better for the grass if you haven’t had rain for a
while — and the toxins are neutralized by the soil.
2. Substitute a bucket of water for a running hose.
Skip the harsh cleaners with ammonia and use a plant-
based, Earth-friendly liquid detergent formulated for car
washing. You can make your own, using the recipe in
Chapter 6.
Use big, fat, cellulose sponges or soft cloths to wash the
car. Leave the sponges with the abrasive scrubbers in the
kitchen — they’re too tough for your car’s surface.
A mixture of vinegar and water works equally as well on
your car windows as it does on home windows, mirrors,
and glass.
3. Wash your car section by section to avoid missing spots.
Some areas are dirtier than others and may take extra elbow
grease. Wash from top to bottom, as well as the wheels.
4. Rinse well to wash off soapy water.
5. Wipe down with a microfiber towel, old towels, or 
chamois, or simply let it air-dry.
For extreme-green car cleaning, dispense with the water altogether
and instead use a waterless cleaner. Simply spray on and wipe off
with a soft cloth. Some cleaners, such as Green Earth’s waterless
car wash, shine your car with a no-VOC, organic solution, offering
up to several washes per bottle, at a cost less than what you’d pay
for a car wash.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 223

Also, be alerted to these special situations when cleaning your car
yourself:
 Don’t use baking soda, which can dull that shiny finish. When
stuck-on materials dry, you may be able to scrape them off with
a credit card or other thin plastic without damaging the paint.
 Chrome is becoming an endangered species in the car world,
as more carmakers are turning to plastic for parts previously
made of metal. On the plus side, plastic means a lighter, more
energy-efficient car. But you do need to avoid abrasive 
cleaners and stick to gentle soaps.
 Be wary of washing at home if you have well water. The high
iron content means your exterior is embedded with tiny red
particles that adhere as the car dries. These particles can
damage the paint.
 If you have a convertible or soft-top auto, be sure to check the
manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning. You may need to use
a special cleaning agent.
Cleaning the car’s interior
Whether you clean the interior of your car after the conveyor wash
or in your own garage, you follow pretty much the same course as
cleaning the exterior (see preceding section). After emptying all
the trash (which, of course, you recycle) out of the car, take these
easy steps to clean up:
1. Damp-dust first as needed.
You’ll definitely need to take this step if you drive on coun-
try roads with the windows rolled down, for example.
2. Pull out floor mats and shake, vacuum, or wash them,
and then allow them to dry in the sun for an extra germ-
killing zap.
3. Use a mild, all-purpose cleaner to wipe down everything
from the steering wheel to vinyl seats.
Review the recipes and cleaning tips in Chapter 6 for
recipes for specific materials.
If your seats are leather, dust first with a dry cloth and, if
necessary, follow with a slightly damp cloth with a touch of
liquid soap to clean out any dirt in cracks or crevices.
4. Locate and treat any stains.
Follow the stain-removing instructions in Chapter 9, based
on the origin of the stain.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
224

5. Vacuum the seat cushions, as you would your uphol-
stered furniture.
6. Clean the trunk.
Clear out the collected debris and vacuum. To keep the sur-
face in good condition, especially if you use it a lot for haul-
ing anything from recycling to garden supplies, spread out
an old blanket that you periodically shake out and wash.
7. (Optional) After vacuuming, you may want to steam that
ground-in dirt loose.
Floors can get pretty filthy. After all, who wipes their feet
before they enter their car?
Retaining a clean-car smell
Keeping your car free of cigarette smoke, pets, and even French
fries goes a long way toward keeping your car more smell-neutral.
Other ways you can avoid “old-car” smell include the following:
 Keep the inside dry. Wet swimsuits, soaked umbrellas, or
even washing the inside with a lot of water can lead to a
musty smell, especially if you already live in a humid place.
 Remove any leaves on the windshield or wipers so that they
don’t get inside the engine or car. Believe it or not, leaves can
make your car smell bad.
 Change your air filter regularly. Take a peek at how disgust-
ingly sooty the old one gets after capturing all that pollen,
dust, and exhaust intake.
 Skip the cloying car fresheners that simply mask other smells.
Instead, try the old box-of-baking-soda-in-the-trunk trick, or
another of the green-scent suggestions in Chapter 11; however,
never use candles or anything with flames around cars.
Caring for Common Garage Items
Your family car keeps company with plenty of other possessions rel-
egated to the garage. When you follow advice about organizing your
garage so that everything has a logical place (see the earlier section
“Organizing a Functional Garage”), you discover that your equip-
ment, tools, toys, keepsakes — even household utilities, such as the
water heater and furnace — are easier to maintain and keep clean.
Additional attention can’t hurt, though. The following sections
offer some considerations for the various types of stuff your
garage shelters.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 225

Lawn mowers and yard equipment
The velvet-green front lawn, as neatly trimmed as a crew cut, may
be a very American tradition, but it’s anything but natural. The typ-
ical suburban yard requires endless mowing, which uses fossil fuel,
creates air and noise pollution, and perpetuates the false ideal of
flawless green.
The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new emission
standards that would reduce exhaust emissions on lawn mowers
and other small, spark-ignition engines by about 35 percent. The
new standards may start in 2011.
In the meantime, if you can convert your yard into a wooded glen,
a wildflower meadow, or a bountiful vegetable garden, you’re put-
ting less of a strain on the environment, to be sure. But many resi-
dential communities restrict what you can do with your exposed
yard, so lawn mowers and yard equipment are a near-necessity for
homeowners in the ’burbs. Good care and maintenance help dimin-
ish the environmental damage done:
 Tune up your lawn mower at the beginning of each cutting
season to ensure the greatest efficiency.
 Keep the blades sharp.
 Ensure that all air filters and moving parts are clean.
 Set the blades to trim grass at the highest level, especially in
the hottest weather.
 Cut your lawn in the evening, when the temperature is lower,
to reduce its negative impact on air quality.
If your lawn is small, an electric lawn mower may be an option.
Plug-ins are limited to about 100 feet from the power outlet.
Cordless models provide approximately one hour of cutting time
before the battery must be recharged, which covers one-quarter to
one-third acre. Electric mowers reduce carbon monoxide and parti-
cle pollutants dramatically and, to some degree, carbon dioxide.
And these models virtually eliminate the noise pollution.
Of course, another option is the motorless, battery-free, push mower,
also called a reel mower. Proponents point out that the blades, which
cut like scissors, make for a healthier cut for the grass.
If you keep your lawn mower in the garage, place it up front during
grass-cutting months and relegate it to the back of the garage
during its hibernation period. Lawn mowers — as well as their
cousins, snow and leaf blowers, chippers, tillers, and other yard
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
226

machines — don’t really need to be cleaned other than making
sure that grass and debris don’t clog up the blades.
If you’re persnickety about dust collecting on the machine during
the off-season, cover it with a tarp. Recycle your old shower 
curtain or an old sheet rather than buying new.
Keep other yard tools stored together. Again, most just need to be
wiped down after use and hung back up or stored in a cabinet.
Keeping them dry so that they don’t rust is probably the most impor-
tant thing. A good coat of mineral oil helps to get them safely through
the winter. Store yard tools correctly in closed cabinets, where sharp
blades are less likely to do damage, and have pruners, clippers, and
even shovels sharpened before planting season in the spring.
Patio and outdoor furniture
Those who use their patio tables, sun umbrellas, chairs, and
loungers on a seasonal basis are likely to keep lawn furniture in the
garage during the winter months. If you’re like me, though, you
probably hate to deal with scrubbing down the grime and dusting
off the spider webs as you take your furniture out of storage for
their time in the sun. Furniture covers reduce much of this chore.
Keep your patio furnishings under wraps, when not in use, and
stored in a back corner of the garage so that they’re out of your
way. When the flowers start to bloom, you can haul everything out
and give it all a quick scrub-down with liquid soap and water or an
all-purpose cleaner, and you’re ready for your first cookout. If you
live in a year-round warm climate, you can leave furniture out
either covered or uncovered.
Sports equipment
Because of the wear and tear that sports equipment must endure,
thoroughly clean all items before storing them for the season or
any length of time. Well-maintained equipment eliminates the need
for replacement. And airing out ice-skates or soccer shoes, wiping
down baseballs and basketballs, and giving helmets and kneepads
a scrub or a wash means that your equipment is clean and ready
for use when the season picks up again. Good drying out is critical
to avoid mildewing and plain-old stinkiness.
Keep all your sports equipment stored in the same area, but use a
type of storage that best fits the item: Cabinets keep balls from
rolling onto the floor, wall hooks put helmets and shoes in plain
sight and allow them to air out, and ceiling hooks get the bicycles
off the floor and out of the way.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 227

Handyman tools
Like yard and garden tools, the items in your toolkit don’t require
cleaning per se. A simple wipe-down after use should be enough. If
you’re a frequent do-it-yourselfer, you probably already have an
efficient means of storing your equipment: a large tool cabinet with
lots of purpose-made compartments for specific tools. Or you may
have a wall system involving hooks and a pegboard.
One woman confessed she owned as many as a dozen screw-
drivers. She kept buying them because she could never find one
when she needed it — certainly not the best way to drive down
consumption behavior! She finally got wise and retrained herself to
always put the tool back in exactly the same place, saving money,
time, and frustration.
Appliances and home 
heating systems
The garage occasionally houses other appliances more commonly
found in the kitchen, laundry room, or other rooms in the home.
The garage is also a common location for the furnace, water sof-
tener, and water heater. Special considerations are in order for
their upkeep and care:
 Furnace: Make sure that the areas surrounding your furnace
are cleared of clutter, for safety and for easy access. Regular
maintenance of your furnace helps improve its energy effi-
ciency, saves you money, and increases the life of the equip-
ment. Most maintenance contracts include two house calls a
year to make sure that everything is working properly with
your furnace and air conditioner. In addition, change the fur-
nace filter once a month, especially if you have pets. The
buildup in the filter can make the furnace work harder — and
expend more energy — than it needs to.
 Water heater: Wrap it up. If your water heater gets a chill, it
works harder to provide you with warm water. A tank wrap —
a thick piece of insulating material or reflective metal film —
can reduce your standby heat loss by up to 45 percent,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy (www.doe.gov).
Also, cover the first few feet of piping from the heater with
pipe insulation. All these materials are available at hardware
and home stores.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
228

 Refrigerator and freezer: Some people hang on to their old
refrigerator and keep it in the garage for extra beverages and
refrigerator overflow. Others keep a big freezer stocked with
frozen foods. Think twice about this decision, though: First of
all, refrigerators and freezers are huge consumers of energy.
But in a hot garage, your appliance must work a lot harder to
keep stuff cold. If stocking an extra fridge or freezer makes
sense for your circumstances, finding it a place inside the
house is better for your energy bill.
Thinking Outside the House
A peculiar phenomenon is afoot in the backyards of America:
Indeed, homeowners are spending more time enjoying the out-
doors — but they appear to be bringing their living rooms and
kitchens outside with them! Pick up any home magazine during
warm weather months, and you’ll read about “outdoor living
rooms” and how to decorate, furnish, cook, entertain, and even
sleep in these spaces.
And why not? Whether catching up on reading on a porch swing,
lazing in a hammock under a shady tree, or hosting a Fourth of July
cookout, the outside of your home is a great place to be.
Of course, your commitment to sustainability influences how you
use and maintain your outdoor living room. Your carbon footprint
extends to this space, as well. (For further explanation of carbon
footprints, turn to Chapter 2.)
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 229
Porches: Covered and screened
Did you know that a front porch is a hallmark of a green home? Interconnectedness
and community support is reflected in this space where you can wave to passersby,
invite neighbors up for a chat, keep an eye on the kids, check out what’s going on
in the ’hood, or simply sit on a summer night and watch the fireflies.
As architects and home builders design projects with sustainability issues in mind,
the traditional front porch is increasingly becoming an important component of the
green home.
Porches may be front, back, or wraparound. What distinguishes them from other out-
door spaces of the home is they always feature a ceiling and a floor of some sort, and
are open or partially open on the sides or with screens. Even apartments or second-
story condos may have a balcony that serves the same purposes as the porch.

Keeping outdoor rooms clean
Areas open to the outdoors are more exposed to the elements, so
they take more of a beating. But screened areas, too, get their
share of the detritus from the great outdoors.
Here’s the No. 1 rule when living with porches, patios, and decks:
Nature happens. You can’t hold these spaces to the same cleaning
standard as the inside of the house unless you’re a glutton for pun-
ishment or have a staff of ten.
So relax and enjoy your space. The upkeep and maintenance can
be kept to a minimum. Flooring is typically an easy-to-clean mate-
rial, such as concrete, wood, stone or brick, or composite material.
To spruce it up, try one or all of these strategies:
 Sweep. You can tackle most surfaces for outdoor living spaces
with a big push broom, typically made from rough-bristled
palmyra (from a type of palm) or sorghum straw.
 Rake. Raking works well on gravel patios and decks when fall
foliage season is in full swing.
 Hose. Being mindful of water use, a quick blast with a garden
hose can wash away grime in minutes. It works on porch
screens, too. Depending on the material, you can also spray
furnishings clean. On a warm, sunny day, everything air-dries
quickly and completely.
Aside from these simple efforts, the best thing you can do for your
outdoor space is to keep it as uncluttered as possible. Don’t use it
as a storage space for toys or garden and yard tools. Who wants to
sit in a place that looks like a junk yard?
Turning to a green decor palette
Furnishing your outdoor space in an environmentally friendly
manner can be a bit of a hit-and-miss proposition. Weather-
resistant cushion and upholstery fabrics, for example, are almost
always made from petroleum-based materials and treated with a
finish. So you may have to compromise your green standard a bit.
The upside to these weather-resistant cushions, upholstery, and
pillows is that they last for many years with little need for cleaning
other than a brushing off of surface dirt. The same fabric is avail-
able for outdoor table umbrellas and awnings.
Several items that no well-appointed outdoor living room should
be without are also environmentally smart:
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
230

 Solar lights: Stocked in every big-box chain and most hard-
ware and home stores, these stick-in-the-ground lights are
usually less than $10 each and offer soft lighting after dark.
Options and styles are increasing: Go modern or mission
style, install spotlights, hang up mountable lights that can be
turned off, or open a solar umbrella that collects energy from
the sun during the day to light your patio at night.
 All-weather rugs: Ever wonder what happens to the plastic
water bottles that get carried off to the recycling center?
Some of them may be underfoot — that is, if you have a color-
ful water-repellent throw rug gracing your porch or patio
floor. Many are as intricately patterned as the most coveted
Oriental rugs and are reversible, and they also resist stain and
mold. Recycled-content outdoor rugs are a breeze to clean,
whether you wash them with a hose or shake them out.
 Umbrella: The patio’s not the patio without a giant umbrella
to block the sun. Many are made with rapidly renewable euca-
lyptus poles. But be aware that the umbrella material is almost
always synthetic treated with a water repellent. Buy a sturdy,
substantive model that can hold up to typhoon-strength
winds, merciless sun, fierce rains, and blistering heat.
 Sunshades: Made of a polyester fabric, outdoor sunshades
block 90 percent of the sun’s ultraviolet rays from penetrating
windows — and keep you protected on the patio, porch, 
or deck.
 Fans: On the covered porch, a ceiling fan helps stir the air,
while adding a cool, Casablanca-style ambiance.
 Firepits or bowls: A cozy fire creates conviviality as family or
friends gather for an evening. Firepit flames are safe, self-
contained, and manageable. Some are made from recycled
cast iron.
What’s Cooking Outdoors?
Nothing says summer like the smell of hamburgers sizzling over a
grill. Despite bugs, breezes, and the blazing sun, homeowners love
to take their meals outside at a picnic table or patio set. Outdoor
cooking has become increasingly sophisticated; some backyards
have what amounts to a complete kitchen outside, including oven,
stovetops, running water, and refrigerator. But whether your idea
of a cookout involves a full kitchen range or a small hibachi, you
can take action to make your outdoor grilling cleaner and greener.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 231

Firing up with the greenest energy
From a performance perspective, the best grill surface is one that
can distribute heat evenly. Coated cast iron or stainless steel is the
material of choice because it won’t rust — and it’s sturdy enough
to last for years. Chrome-plated aluminum loses its plating after a
while, and the oxidizing aluminum is toxic.
The fuel used to fire up the grill is the biggest green conundrum.
The two most commonly used sources are charcoal and gas, each
with its pros and cons.
Many people insist that charcoal results in the best taste. But char-
coal mostly comes from forests that aren’t sustainably managed.
Charcoal is extremely polluting, and most commercial products
contain toxic compounds that can be harmful when burned,
including borax, sodium nitrate, and coal dust. To add fuel to the
fire — literally — the most common starter, lighter fluid, is a petro-
leum fuel that presents its own harmful components, which often
end up on the food you eat.
If you choose to go with charcoal grilling, follow these tips:
 Buy charcoal that is free of chemical additives.
 Skip the lighter fluid entirely and start your briquettes
burning with a small paper fire.
You’re probably better off going with a gas grill over a charcoal
grill. However, whether the grill uses natural gas or propane, non-
renewable resources are being tapped. In addition, those who love
their food on the smoky side claim that gas grilling just doesn’t
produce the flavor that they equate with cooking out. Still, gas
grilling is efficient, much less polluting than charcoal, and,
arguably, the best green grilling alternative.
Another suggestion is to choose a hybrid gas grill that allows for
some judicious use of charcoal or wood to add flavor.
Practicing safe grilling
Whenever fire is involved, risks increase. Always grill in the open
air, never in a closed space, such as a garage. And keep high-
powered grills away from the home’s exterior wall.
When it comes to food safety, you have two issues: undercooking
and overcooking.
Part III: Cleaning Green, Room by Room 
232

When raw meat and poultry aren’t cooked thoroughly, organisms
such as salmonella and E. coli can breed and make you sick. Be
sure to cook pork, beef, and chicken to a degree that such bacteria
are killed. Use a thermometer to ensure that beef is cooked to
145°F, pork to 160°F, and poultry to 165°F.
In addition, be sure your prep activities reduce the chance for 
bacteria buildup:
 Use separate cutting boards and utensils for meat. Don’t 
prepare vegetables and other food with the same tools.
 Wash all utensils in hot soapy water or in the dishwasher.
 Refrigerate leftovers promptly.
For more information on kitchen safety, read Chapter 7. Also, 
consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://
CDC.gov) and www.foodsafety.gov, a clearinghouse of govern-
ment information on food-borne illnesses and advice on food safety.
When meat is charred — so overcooked that some parts resemble
the burned pieces of firewood — it can form polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines. Evidence strongly suggests
that these substances may increase the risk of certain cancers. Check
the Department of Health and Human Services (www.hhs.gov) 
for reports on the health effects from overgrilling with charcoal.
Cleaning the grill
No way around it, cooking on an open grill presents cleanup 
challenges: Grease spatters and burnt-on food aren’t the easiest
messes to wipe away. And you don’t want to let this crud build up,
as it can result in a less-than-perfect grilling experience. Commercial
grill cleaners contain potent chemicals and fumes. Start with an all-
purpose green cleaner or whip up one of the recipes in Chapter 6
that targets grease. Here are some other grill-cleaning tips:
 Wait until the grill is cool before attempting to clean.
 Brush the grill with a stiff wire brush designed for this pur-
pose to loosen all the charred food and buildup that you can.
 On portable and smaller units, remove the top grid to scrub
and wash in hot soapy water.
 Pop stainless steel utensils in the dishwasher; wash wood-
handled utensils by hand.
Chapter 12: Transitioning from Home to the Great Outdoors 233

 On larger gas grills, follow the manufacturer’s cleaning
instructions.
 For built-in ovens and grills, clean as you would your indoor
oven and stove (see Chapter 7).
 Keep the grill covered when not in use to keep dust and dirt off.

T
hey may accuse you of talking baby talk if you tell them to
Google something. And their understanding of BlackBerries is
as an ingredient in pie. But you can learn a thing or two from your
grandparents — or other folks from the generations who grew up in
the ’30s, ’40s, and even ’50s, at a time when modern home conven-
iences were often still a novelty or a luxury.
Your grandparents may be young or old. Or you may be one of the
grandparents of which I speak. If so, hats off to you for serving as a
role model to new generations eager to adopt behaviors that may
have once seemed “old-fashioned” to them, but now are recognized
as a way to be kinder to the planet.
Using Wind Power
An older friend remembers steamy summer nights in her family’s
third-floor apartment, when the air was so oppressive that she and
her sister slept on the floor by the window where an occasional
breeze might cool them. Instead of tucking them into their sheets,
her mother laid damp towels on them. Every couple of hours,
she’d come back through and change the old towel — which had
completely dried out — with a new fresh, cool towel.
No wonder my friend keeps her air conditioning at a cool 68°F 
in the summer! But on those perfect days between too-hot and 

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
238
too-cold, when the temperature is just right, she turns off the air or
furnace and opens the windows, letting fresh breezes drift in and
circulate the air naturally.
Subsequent generations, it seems, have adjusted to heating and
cooling monitored by a “system.” So even when the weather outside
couldn’t be more perfect, it doesn’t occur to many people to take
advantage of the “real thing” and turn off the artificial control. In
fact, in a good number of commercial buildings constructed in the
latter decades of the 20th-century, the windows were designed not
to be opened. Ever.
It may be an old-fashioned notion, but opening the windows when
it’s nice outside is a smart green practice that
 Lowers your energy use
 Saves you money
 Keeps you cool
 Improves indoor air quality
 Creates a healthy cross-ventilation
 Alleviates dampness, which can lead to mildew and mold
Opening the windows is a savvy home practice — unless you or
someone in your household suffers from pollen-based allergies. In
that case, during allergy season, keep the windows shut and rely
on ceiling and/or floor fans for stirring up the air.
Hanging It Out to Dry
Wander through any suburban neighborhood, and it’s clear that
line-drying laundry is on the list of endangered domestic practices.
What with the use of clothes dryers and homeowner association
covenants, it’s an unfriendly environment, indeed, for this time-
honored tradition.
But in your grandparents’ day, the sight of sheets billowing in
breezes perfumed by sunlit days was as ubiquitous as fireworks on
the Fourth of July, a Norman Rockwell portrait of American life that
has virtually vanished in the past few decades.
But there’s hope: As more and more families are on board with
environmental behaviors, and energy prices continue to skyrocket,
the clothesline is beginning to return to its natural habitat: the
backyard.

Take advantage of solar power you can access without panels or
photovoltaic technology. When the sun is out, string up a clothes-
line or pop up a pole-dryer and let the sun do its magic on your
wash. Chances are, your clothes will dry almost as quickly as they
would have in the dryer — with no lint trap to clean!
Don’t have the lawn, or the weather is lousy outside? Then use a
drying rack on a porch or inside in the bathtub, or hang shirts on
pegs in the laundry room.
See Chapter 9 for the secrets of maximizing your drying power
while minimizing energy.
Keeping It as Simple 
as Soap and Water
When it came to tackling household chores from dishes to floors,
Grandma pulled out her secret weapon: soap and water. A mixture
of plain, unadulterated hot water and simple soap — liquid or bar —
was the first line of defense.
Contrast that to today’s modern dirt warfare, where each house-
hold surface has its own specialized formula. Defending the home
with so much cleaner is the nuclear arms proliferation of home
cleaning: There’s power enough here to eradicate dirt a hundred
times over.
Discovered more than 150 years ago, doctors’ use of soap and
water for simple hand washing was proven to save the lives of
countless mothers and infants, who previously died because of
bacterial infections in the hospital. Using soap and water remains
today as one of the best defenses against germ-borne illnesses in
hospitals and homes. In fact, the most recent research finds that all
the antibacterial hand-washing and cleaning formulas don’t perform
a much better job of cleaning and even pose some potential risks.
(Turn to Chapter 7 for more about concerns with using antibacterial
products.)
Throughout this book, I refer to soap and water as the frontline
cleaning tactic, for everything from hands to ink stains on clothing.
In most cases, I suggest a liquid soap, such as dish soap or castile,
a basic vegetable-oil-based product. You can attack all sorts of
household surfaces and chores with soap and water, including dishes,
window screens, hand-washable silk materials, most hard-surface
floors, stainless-steel sinks and appliances, and porcelain fixtures.
Chapter 13: Ten (Or So) Ways Your Grandparents Got It Right 239

If soap and water didn’t do the job, Grandma had plenty of other
tricks up her apron — remedies that she didn’t have to reach much
farther for than the kitchen cabinet: vinegar, salt, baking soda, or
lemon juice, all nontoxic, inexpensive, natural, and effective.
Practicing the Virtue of Saving
More than one friend has described the pack-rat habits of a parent
or grandparent as a “Depression holdover.” And those individuals
who lived through a period of scarcity, whether a nationwide phe-
nomenon or a personal experience, tend to save — everything — in
the event that they may someday need it or find another use for it.
I’ve seen folks save items ranging from phone books and margarine
tubs to aluminum TV-dinner trays and the front side of greeting
cards to be used as postcards.
I’m sure more than one child of Depression-era parents has rolled
their eyes over what they consider a quirky obsession. But the
value behind this behavior is a solid green one: Saving and reusing
reduces the demand on the world’s limited resources, whether
trees, petroleum, metal, or rock. It recognizes and respects that
these materials are finite and precious. And it puts into practice a
belief that, even if you can afford not to save and reuse, unrestrained
consumption is a gluttonous and wasteful behavior.
As materials and possessions find their way into your home and
life, let the spirit of your Depression-era forebears guide your treat-
ment of them. Here are a few examples of items to save and reuse:
 Glass bottles or jars: For casual flower vases or holding just
about anything, such as loose change.
 Plastic produce bags: I know, I know . . . you’re already using
your canvas totes for grocery shopping. But chances are,
you’re still collecting lots of bags from the carrots, lemons,
grapes, and avocados you’re bagging up with each visit. Rinse
or shake out and put back into your shopping bag for holding
produce the next time you hit the store.
 Newspapers: The daily rag is a pretty easy item to recycle, but
your newspaper may also find some practical use in your
home. Set aside a stack for cleaning windows; if you’re a gar-
dener, you can use up months and months’ worth as a weed
suppressor under mulch. Instead of buying expensive gift-
wrapping paper, newspaper can be decorated or — especially
if you employ the comics — stand on its own as a fun wrap.
Part III: The Part of Tens 
240

 Old furniture: Rethink any other possible uses for a piece
that’s still sturdy but has outlived its usefulness in its present
form. A dining table may serve as a coffee table once its legs
are shortened. An interior door can be set on two sawhorses
and used as a worktable. Even faded, chipped, and worn
wooden chairs that can no longer support a sitting adult make
surprisingly attractive garden accents when left to weather
and blend into a patch of trailing vines.
Repairing Instead of Replacing
The gag of a long-running commercial touted that a particular
brand of washing machine was so well made, the poor repairmen
trained to fix it were left with virtually nothing to do day after day.
Not to discredit the appliance maker, but repair services for wash-
ing machines and other appliances aren’t in demand for another
reason: When they go on the fritz, it’s more common — and some-
times easier and cheaper — to simply replace them rather than fix
them. And, that is certainly true of a $59 vacuum cleaner or a
microwave oven.
Planned obsolescence of electronics and appliances has resulted
in a constant cycle of products moving in and out of our lives. The
result is bigger landfills, vast depletion of resources, and increasing
energy consumption for the manufacture of new stuff.
Take a tip from your frugal forebears and seek out ways to repair
and reuse before replacing. Some examples:
 Buy products that last. A cheap appliance is no bargain if it
falls apart within a year or two of purchase. Better to invest
more money for a long-term savings — for cash and for
resources.
 Take care of your possessions, whether priceless antiques or
humdrum household appliances or everyday clothing. Help
them last longer by using and maintaining them as instructed.
 Make contact with a repair shop or expert at repairing
appliances, electronics, and other items. They’re increasingly
hard to find, but they still exist.
Cooking from Scratch
A friend mentioned that she gave up taking her mom out to nice
restaurants for special events: Never a time went by where her
Chapter 13: Ten (Or So) Ways Your Grandparents Got It Right 241

mother didn’t cluck over the obscene price of the chicken dinner
and observe that she could have made the whole meal at home
and served a family of four for less. My friend noted that the very
idea of spending so much money on food seemed to make her
mom lose her appetite.
Everyone has an older relative known for her homemade egg noo-
dles, rye bread, beef stew, marinara sauce, egg rolls, or chocolate
cake served with love and pride and, whether they realize it, a
heaping dose of green.
Making food from scratch is one of the best ways to reduce the
amount of oil in your diet — crude oil, that is. Along with whatever
nutrients and calories are contained in your kung pao frozen
entree, you get a big serving of fossil fuel. That’s what it takes to
grow, raise, harvest, process, package, ship, and store your food
before you drop it in your grocery cart. And the farther it travels,
the higher the fossil-fuel content.
When you make your meals from scratch and buy your food from
local producers, you can reduce your negative impact on the
planet in many ways:
 Less processing. Basic ingredients require fewer preserva-
tives and production steps than frozen, packaged, and canned
convenience foods.
 Less packaging. Pantry staples generally involve minimal
packaging and labeling.
 Less travel. Products purchased locally require less fuel to ship.
The average distance that grocery items travel is 1,500 miles.
 More taste and nutritional value. Strawberries that travel
cross-country to get to your cereal bowl lose nutrients every
hour they’re on the road.
Keeping Your Dollars 
in the Community
Back before the homogenization of shopping habits — now you
can be anywhere in the United States and find a strip of nationally
advertised chain stores and fast-food restaurants — consumers
had a relationship with the merchants they did business with.
You’ve seen the caricatures of these guys in old movies: the guy
named Pops who owned the five-and-dime; or Doc, who ran the
pharmacy; and Madge, the motherly figure operating the diner.
Part III: The Part of Tens 
242

Pops, Doc, and Madge may have been fictional characters, but the
sense of personal connection they portrayed and the loyalty that
customers felt for the places they did business with was real.
Community is one of the cornerstones of sustainable living. From
small-town America to the nation’s biggest urban centers, when
you cooperate with your neighbors, you gain efficiencies and build
trust. You share both material possessions as well as information.
And you support your neighbors’ enterprises and interests
because they’re also your interests.
Green benefits from patronizing local businesses include the 
following:
 You have more trust in the product and service claims of
locals, who have a vested interest in being known by their
neighbors as honest and scrupulous.
 You know that locally produced items, whether food or manu-
factured goods, haven’t traveled as far to reach you, thus 
minimizing the energy consumption required to get to you.
 You can more easily ascertain that your merchant or producer
adheres to your values. For example, it’s easier to determine
whether the green beans at the local farmers’ market are 
pesticide-free.
Dressing for Housework
The traditional and quintessential housekeeping uniform of the
mid-20th century included an apron, likely with pockets to hold
everything from clothespins to cleaning cloths; rubber gloves for
tough work; and a scarf to tie up hair. (Of course, if this image were
sketched out in, say, the 1950s, you’d also see the figure wearing a
full-skirted housedress and heels.)
Rare is the homeowner today — male or female — who dons an
apron to get down to work with a mop, cleaning rag, or vacuum.
And I don’t want to imply that wearing an apron, hair covering, and
rubber gloves is some badge of honor for green cleaning. But what
this uniform symbolizes is an outlook that dirt and germs aren’t
sprayed away by a press of a button, but by going head-to-head,
tackling and putting some elbow grease and sweat equity into the
work. Maybe you wear an old pair of shorts or jeans instead.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for taking advantage of the miracles of
modern technology in keeping an orderly house. No bucket and
washboard for me! But when it comes to the health and safety of
the people in my home, I’d rather scrub a little harder, mop a little
Chapter 13: Ten (Or So) Ways Your Grandparents Got It Right 243

longer, and raise a little more dust than take care of the problem
with a chemical that harms the people who breathe it in or the
Earth from which it was extracted.
I rarely wear an apron. I pull my hair back into a pony tail, and I wear
rubber gloves only for tasks in which my hands would get super
wet. But I do wrap myself in the same approach toward home care
as my grandmother, who had a direct, hands-on relationship with
her home and the tasks that made it a welcoming, comfortable, safe,
and pleasant environment.
Shifting into Manual
Sometimes, not only is it greener to tackle a task without an elec-
tronic aid, but approaching a job manually does a better job, as
well. Take cleaning a rug, for example: You can plug in the vacuum
and run it over the throw, and that’ll get the dust and dirt off the
surface of that rug.
Or you can carry the rug outside, throw it over a clothesline or
fence, and whip the heck out of it with a rug beater — or a baseball
bat. As you watch the dirt fly, you have no doubt that this old-
fashioned means of rug cleaning is getting the job done. Even a
quick shake outside works wonders, I take this approach all the
time for door mats and area rugs. (And don’t forget to sweep
underneath the mat or rug before replacing it.)
Your grandparents may not have had much choice, but if they had,
they may have discovered that sometimes the old way of doing
things was nearly as easy and just as effective as the newfangled
approach. Consider these more energy-efficient options to 
household tasks:
 Dry mopping a hard-surface floor instead of vacuuming.
 Line-drying or drying on an indoor rack instead of using the
clothes dryer.
 Scooping up a counter mess with a sponge rather than
revving up the hand vacuum.
 Washing up a handful of dishes instead of cycling them
through the dishwasher.
 Using a countertop dish draining rack so that dishes air-dry,
which is more sanitary than drying with a used dish towel and
uses no energy.

already making sweeping changes in the way you shop, travel,
work, and purchase. Green living is invasive — in a good way. As
you’ve no doubt discovered, the changes you make in one facet of

example — spill over into other areas. (Now, you’re probably think-
ing twice before watering your lawn.)

This chapter describes ten ideas for greening your life in easy-to-
implement but big-impact ways.

Insulate and Weatherproof 
Your Home
Nearly half of home energy usage goes toward heating and cooling.
In fact, properly insulating your home can save as much as 25 
percent off your home heating bill.
Although your home needs to be well-ventilated in order to
breathe and remain healthy, creating a tight envelope helps reduce
the amount of energy — and cost — used to heat or cool your
home. In some communities, utility companies perform energy
audits for their customers. Otherwise, you can hire an independent
energy auditor to test your home for energy leaks. After you hear
the diagnosis, you can take action.
The most likely areas that need attention include
 Exterior walls, attic, and basement or crawlspace. For existing
homes, insulating attic and basement areas is an easier job
than insulating walls. Most traditional fiberglass insulation —
you know, the cotton-candy-pink strips? — contains formalde-
hyde. Some fiberglass products are formaldehyde-free. Other
green options are readily available. Consider insulation made
from recycled blue jeans, loose-fill cellulose from recycled
newspapers, or soy-based spray foam.
 Doors. Caulk and add weatherstripping to stop leaks. Do the
same for windows and baseboards.
 Windows. Use storm windows in cold-weather seasons, espe-
cially if your windows are older or poorly insulated. If you’re
ready to replace them, choose Energy Star–rated windows,
which can reduce heat loss and heat gain, depending on the
season and climate. Look to www.energystar.gov for the
best U-factor and solar heat gain ratings for your region.
 Electrical outlets. Energy leaks from some of the most surpris-
ing places. Place foam inserts behind the light switch and
outlet plates on outside walls to block escaping energy.
 Attic vents and ducts. Check outside openings, including
plumbing and electrical openings, for leaks. Weatherproof as
appropriate.
Switch Your Lights
Who would imagine that a little light bulb could have such a big
impact on energy reduction? Those funny-looking, pretzel-twist
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
246

light bulbs may cost a bit more (as much as three times as much)
than standard incandescent bulbs, but compact fluorescent lamps
(CFLs) last up to ten times longer and can reduce energy consump-
tion by at least two-thirds.
The newest bright spot on the lighting horizon, LED (light-emitting
diode) lighting is making its way beyond traffic stoplights and
remote controls to lighting for the home, especially in low-light
applications, such as under cabinets and task lighting.
LED lights tend to cost a lot, recently priced between $35 and $60,
depending on use. But their advantages are many:
 Last up to 60,000 hours (CFL life is 10,000 and incandescents,
1,000).
 Light up immediately
 Produce no heat
 Require as little as 2 watts of energy
 Hold up well to frequent on–off cycles
 Contain no mercury
In virtually every big-box chain and hardware store, filling larger
amounts of shelf space are low-energy light bulbs providing solutions
for reading lamps, outdoor spotlights, three-way lights, dimmable fix-
tures, and other specialty needs. Manufacturers are responding to
criticism about color quality and slowness to brighten, and the
product continues to improve.
Be aware that frequent on–off cycling shortens the life of CFLs —
they’re best for lights that are left on for long periods. And once the
CFL has burned out, you must dispose of it responsibly. CFL bulbs
contain mercury. Though the amount is minimal and poses little
risk even if broken, be sure to deliver it to a hazardous-materials
collection site so that it doesn’t end up in a landfill.
Program Your Thermostat
What difference can 2 tiny degrees make in your home? It depends
on how you look at it: If you’re talking personal comfort level, 2°F
is unlikely to be noticed. If you’re considering your monthly utility
bills, the savings are measurable. And if you’re calculating environ-
mental impact, this small change makes more of a difference than
you’d imagine. Just 2°F lower in winter and higher in summer can
result in an average of 2,000 pounds of CO2 emissions per year.
(Review Chapter 2 for a more detailed explanation of CO2 green-
house gases and how everyday activities generate them.)
Chapter 14: Ten Steps — Beyond Clean — to Green Your Home 247

Install a programmable thermostat, and if you set temps at the
most energy-efficient levels you’re comfortable with, you should
earn back the cost in energy savings within a year. For the biggest
bite out of your household carbon footprint — and energy bill —
try tactics customized to the temperature outside.
In cold weather:
 Lower the temperature for sleep. Most people get a better
rest when the air is a bit cooler. Try setting your thermostat at
65°F or lower, as long as you’re comfortable. (Some folks go as
low as 50°F — as long as they’re under their toasty comforters.)
 Layer it on. Dress for the weather even when you’re inside.
Slip on a long-sleeved shirt under your sweater or add a light-
weight jacket. Pull on tights, leggings, or thermals. These
extra layers permit you to lower the thermostat a little more.
 Program the thermostat to lower temps when you’re out of
the house. You can lower the temperature whether you’re at
work or away for the weekend.
 Work with your windows. On clear days, open the blinds and
let the sun’s radiant heat warm up your home. At night and
during cloudy days, keep curtains and blinds closed to insu-
late from the cold.
In warm weather:
 Set the temp to 78°F or higher when you’re out of the house.
Lower it to a level you can be comfortable at only when you’re
home.
 Turn off the air conditioner when you plan to be gone for a
couple of days or longer. No sense in wasting energy cooling
an empty home. Unlike in winter, when freezing temperatures
can result in burst water pipes, uncomfortably warm temps
probably won’t do damage. This is an it-depends-where-you-
live or how-long-you-are-gone situation. It may be wise to leave
the AC on if mold or mildew is a potential problem or the
houseplants will die if it gets ridiculously hot.
 Keep south-facing windows covered with curtains during
the sun hours. Consider installing external awnings to further
reduce solar gain.
 Where possible, take advantage of cool evenings. Turn off
the AC and open the windows for airflow.
 Use fans to create a breeze in a single room rather than air
conditioning the entire home.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
248

There’s no truth to the myth that it takes more energy to bring
your home back to the desired temperature when it’s lower or
higher than comfortable. So before you head out the door for the
day, adjust the thermostat for your absence and save on energy
and expense. If you need more motivation, keep this in mind: For
every degree you can adjust the temperature for an eight-hour
period, you save 2 percent of your heating bill for that day.
Switch to Green Power
Many people would like to be able to switch from fossil-fuel
sources of home energy to renewable resources such as wind,
solar, geothermal, or hydro, but are unable to install the appropri-
ate systems on their property because of cost or other limitations.
Green power is an option available to many homeowners served
by a local utility company. You can purchase your electricity in the
form of green power from solar, wind, or geothermal sources, and
you can choose to buy anywhere from 10 percent to 100 percent of
your home-use kilowatt hours (the measurement form for electrical
energy use) from renewables.
Be aware, however, that buying green power doesn’t mean that the
power to run your air conditioner is coming directly from a nearby
windmill. Most utilities companies purchase Renewable Energy
Certificates (RECs) from renewable producers, possibly located in
other states. The RECs represent the benefits received (less 
greenhouse gases) when conventional fuels aren’t used.
Typically, a green power program adds a little more money to your
monthly bill, but utilities average that additional cost at no more
than $3 to $5 a month. Happy consumers, however, continue to
report a much lower incremental increase — as little as $1 a month!
And that amount is easily recouped by making other small changes
to your energy habits, such as programming your thermostat by a
couple of degrees.
No one wants to pay any more than they have to for utilities, but if
more people send the message that the public wants clean, renew-
able power, the more likely utility companies are to pursue these
alternatives, and the more likely local and state governments are
to support green initiatives.
Contact your energy provider and find out whether it offers a green
power program. Or check the U.S. Department of Energy Web site
at www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower to find out where and
how you can purchase green power.
Chapter 14: Ten Steps — Beyond Clean — to Green Your Home 249

If you’re ready to take it to the next level, consider getting off the
grid entirely by installing solar power for your home. These under-
takings can require a huge investment, but the costs are getting
lower all the time. (For more on solar options, see Solar Power Your
Home For Dummies [Wiley] by Rik DeGunther.)
Change Your Eating Habits
Most food purchased from your neighborhood supermarket has
traveled an average of 1,500 miles. Accompanying your tomatoes
on their journey from the field to your table is plenty of oil — and
not the extra-virgin, cold-pressed kind. Oil, as in fossil fuel, is
required to grow, harvest, ship, store, process, and package your
produce.
The industrial food system is dependent on petroleum, and is one
of the largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions. As a counter
measure, growing movements, such as Slow Food (www.slow-
food.com) and the 100-Mile Diet (www.100milediet.org),
encourage eating food grown or produced locally.
When you buy food grown and produced nearby, you reduce the envi-
ronmental impact of your daily bread. You also have access to fresher,
just-picked produce that retains more nutrients. And you support
your own community of growers, co-operatives, and suppliers.
Eat at restaurants known for using local ingredients. The chefs
often shop at the same farmers’ markets you do. You can also ask
farmers which restaurants they supply to and what the chefs buy.
Visit farms, pick fruit and vegetables in season, and get on e-mail
lists. Here are a few additional ideas:
In addition to buying locally produced food, here are some more
ways to reduce the amount of “oil” in your diet:
 Buy organic products. Only foods that meet the standards of
the USDA National Organic Program can carry the USDA
Organic seal. The seal tells you that a product is at least 95
percent organic. Organic food differs from conventionally pro-
duced food in the way it’s grown, handled, and processed. For
example, under USDA rules, organically grown produce can’t
be treated with synthetic pesticides. The produce sold at local
farmers’ markets may have been grown by organic methods,
but can’t be advertised as organic without having the official
certification. Again, it helps to know your providers — their
growing practices may be acceptable to you, even without the
government seal of approval.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
250

 Buy less processed, heavily packaged, and complicated,
multi-ingredient frozen foods. The more “prepared” your
food is, the more energy is required to process, package, and
maintain the product until you buy it, take it home, and serve
it up.
 Buy items in bulk quantities to cut down on packaging. A
dog-food-sized bag of rice requires a lot less paper and wrap-
ping than the same quantity in 20 or more smaller-sized bags.
Some grocery stores offer bins of flour, beans, rice, nuts,
pasta, and more. Bring your own bags, scoop out what you
need, weigh it, and pay for it. At home, rice and beans may
need to be washed and sorted (to remove debris such as
small stones) before cooking.
 Reduce the amount of meat in your diet. Raising livestock
puts greater pressure on land, water, and energy resources.
 When buying meat, choose grass-fed beef and free-range
chicken, because they require less “oil” in terms of
processed feed. Although free-range doesn’t mean the chick-
ens actually roam the range, it may be an indication of more
humane treatment than factory-farm chickens get. Again,
when buying from local suppliers, you’re more likely to know
the practices and values under which they operate.
 Start building a personal relationship with your food: grow
your own. Nothing is better than homegrown strawberries
topping cereal or herbs clipped, cleaned, chopped, and
thrown into omelets or stews. Use raised-bed gardens filled
with organic soil, and place the beds close to the kitchen or
the backdoor for ease of access. Even apartment dwellers can
grow tomatoes, herbs, and more in container gardens. (For
more on this topic, see Gardening For Dummies [Wiley] by
Michael MacCaskey, Bill Marken, and The Editors of The
National Gardening Association.)
 Shop with a conscience. When purchasing coffee, tea, and
chocolate, choose fair-trade-designated products. This desig-
nation signifies that the producers are getting a fair price for
their product, that they work under reasonable and safe con-
ditions, and that the practices to produce the item are sustain-
able. Other food items may also be designated as fair trade.
 When buying fish, be aware of species that are under threat
of extinction due to overfishing or habitat destruction. A
good resource for information on which fish to avoid is
www.seafoodwatch.org.
Chapter 14: Ten Steps — Beyond Clean — to Green Your Home 251

The world of green eating can sometimes be confusing. When pre-
sented with a choice between organic and local, for example, the
“greenest” option may not be so clear-cut. Say that you’re selecting
tomatoes in an East Coast grocery. Should you choose the organic
tomatoes from California, or the conventional ones grown on a
nearby farm? The locally grown tomato probably has less fossil
fuel attached to it, even if not certified organic. Some growers may
use little, if any, chemicals on their crops, but haven’t gotten offi-
cial organic certification.
Think Before You Drive
Unless you live near reliable public transportation, you no doubt
must count on an automobile to get you almost anywhere you need
to go. While eliminating the car from your life may not be possible,
you have plenty of options for reducing its use.
One of the biggest changes you can make also saves you time and
money, and it’s so simple. Just think before you drive! As you get ready
to run an errand — say, you have to run out to get some milk — take
a minute to answer these questions:
 Do I really need it now? If you don’t need it until this evening
and you know you have to pick up the kids in a few hours, you
can postpone the chore and combine it with that trip.
 Could someone else do it? A spouse on the way home from
work? A neighbor who’s running out anyway?
 Do I need other things from the same place? How many
times have you picked up an item or two at the store — then
returned home to discover you need three others?
 Where is the closest place to get it? What’s the best route?
One route may be shorter, but if it requires more time idling at
stoplights or in crawling traffic, adding distance may actually
reduce fuel use.
 Can I accomplish any other errands on this same trip? For
example, can you drop off the recycling and swing by the
library?
 Is this the most fuel-efficient option I have? If you have more
than one car, always choose the one that gets the best
mileage. If your destination is less than a mile or so away,
leave the car in the garage and walk or bike.
By taking the time to think through how and when you use your
car, you’re certain to cut down on the use of your car. Here are a
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
252

few more tips for reducing the size of your carbon footprint 
attributed to driving:
 Use public transportation. Reliable bus or train service is
sadly lacking in many cities and suburbs of the United States.
But do what you can to support your local mass transit. The
service may not be adequate yet to get you to and from work
regularly, but you may be able to use it to get to friends’
homes, the museum, or shopping areas.
 Join or create a carpool. Many workers shrink from carpool-
ing because they dread giving up their independence and flex-
ibility. But if four workers come together, that action takes
three cars off the road two times a day. The plus side is you
get to say that you can’t stay for that late meeting because
your carpool leaves at 5 p.m.!
When You Do Drive, Drive Smart
You don’t have to buy a hybrid car to cut down on your fuel 
consumption. Just take some loving care of your current vehicle 
and change some of your driving practices, and you’ll notice the
change — as much as 30 percent increased efficiency:
 Get a tuneup. Regular maintenance keeps your car performing
at its best. If just 1 percent of car owners maintained their
vehicles, it would keep nearly a billion pounds of CO2 out of
the air.
 Check your tires. When they’re properly inflated, you get
better gas mileage.
 Go for a cruise. Cruise control, that is. Maintaining a steady
and moderate speed saves on fuel costs. Fuel efficiency drops
rapidly after hitting the 65 mph point. Avoid rapid acceleration
or deceleration; sudden stops and starts require more gas.
 Cut the engine. It’s not just idle talk: Turning off your car
saves gas, even if you’re only stopped for a couple of minutes.
You may not want to turn off the car in stalled traffic, but
bypass the fast-food drive-thru’s and park and go in.
If it’s time to replace your car, do get a model that’s fuel-efficient.
More affordable options are becoming available all the time. Some
hybrids claim to get 60 miles per gallon. For every increase of 1
mile in fuel efficiency, you can reduce your carbon impact by 1,000
pounds. Take a peek at Chapter 2 for a further explanation of CO2
and greenhouse gas.
Chapter 14: Ten Steps — Beyond Clean — to Green Your Home 253

Reduce Your Paper Use
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, people in the
United States recycle more than half of all paper used, and efforts
are increasing. That’s good news. But with an average per-capita
paper consumption of 740 pounds per year, reducing paper con-
sumption is as critical as recycling it. With every office worker
using up as much as one ton of paper in a 2.3-year cycle, it’s no sur-
prise that the paper industry is the world’s third-largest industrial
polluter.
From the piles of junk mail and catalogs you accumulate at home,
to the reams of paper churned out for reports, memos, copies, and
drafts that never see the light of day, you can find plenty of ways to
shorten the height of that mountain of paper deluging your life.
At home:
 Stop the flow of junk mail and catalogs. Register with the
Direct Marketing Association at www.dmachoice.org to be
removed from direct-mail lists for up to three years. Go to
www.optoutprescreen.com to get off mailing lists for pre-
screened credit and insurance offers. And to reduce your 
catalog load, sign up with Catalog Choice at www.catalog
choice.org.
 Use the backsides of used paper. Stock your at-home printer
with stacks of used letter-sized sheets. You don’t need virgin
sheets for printing driving directions. Get one more use out of
each sheet before sticking it in the recycling bin. Also, cut up
one-side prints for message notes.
 Sign up for e-billing. Most merchants and service providers
offer an online billing option. And when you’re set up for elec-
tronic payment, you eliminate the paper wasted for the
invoice, envelope, and return envelope, as well as for your
paper check. Oh, and you save postage, too.
At work:
 Move to paperless processes. Ironically, the advent of computer
technology in the workplace has resulted in greater paper con-
sumption. Businesses are moving toward paperless processes
when possible. Suggest to your employer this cost-saving tactic —
and you may be recognized as Employee of the Year.
 Change the margins. Seriously. According to http://change
themargins.com (yes, there’s a whole movement), if you
reduce your margins to .75 inch from Microsoft Word’s default
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
254

of 1.5 inches on each side, for every ton of paper used, you
save 19 reams. With the average office worker going through
10,000 sheets each year, that’s a hefty savings. Add this change
to double-side copying, single-space line formatting, and
reusing the backside of paper for draft copies, and imagine the
trees and oil you could save — not to mention money.
 Buy responsibly. Choose paper with post-consumer content,
which means the material used to manufacture the paper
came from the used paper from people like you. (A lot of paper
advertised as recycled comes from material scraps from the
manufacturing process.) To ensure that the paper is manufac-
tured in a sustainable manner (trees from managed forests,
manufacturing without toxic chemicals, and minimal impact on
environment), choose paper certified by the Forest Stewardship
Council (www.fsc.org) and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative
(www.aboutsfi.org).
Buy Less, Reuse More
There’s a reason that “reduce” and “reuse” come before “recycle.”
While finding a new purpose for a product that’s completed its own
use cycle is good, you’re better off avoiding the need to recycle in
the first place. The recycling process itself exhorts an energy cost —
those outdoor carpets don’t weave themselves from old water bottles!
Pursuing a reduce-and-reuse path may take resolve, but cutting
back on consumption is key to reducing energy use. Don’t look at
buying less as a sacrifice, but as a path toward simplifying an
overly cluttered life so that you can focus on what counts most.
Fewer possessions means less stress and less work.
Adhering to a fix-first, replace-last philosophy is a challenge. A
friend decided to replace a part on her broken blender rather than
buy a new one. She couldn’t find any place in her city that carried
the part, so she tracked down the manufacturer and model (already
obsolete at five years old) on the Internet. With shipping, the part
cost more than $30: about the price of a new blender.
When you do need to replace or acquire something, buying used or
borrowing are good green strategies. Some easy steps include the
following:
 Patronize the public library. What an underappreciated 
institution — making information available to anyone who 
can present a library card. Do you really need to own that
bestselling mystery novel? How about just borrowing it and
giving it back for someone else to enjoy when you’re done?
Chapter 14: Ten Steps — Beyond Clean — to Green Your Home 255

 Share big-ticket items. No one needs a snow blower or lawn
mower 24/7. In some cases, sharing ownership, among 
neighbors or family, of certain appliances can make sense.
 Give it a makeover. Why reupholstering a sofa costs more
than buying a new one is perplexing, probably due to high
labor and fabric costs. Nevertheless, reupholstering or using a
slipcover is definitely a greener choice — especially when
your old couch has good bones. Recover, repaint, and refinish
to revitalize worn chairs, tables, and other furnishings. Even
pieces deemed beyond salvation may have new life as a work
table in the garage.
 Shop used. Think consignment shops carrying gently used
designer fashions, and flea markets filled with great furniture
finds. Opportunities to buy almost anything you can imagine
are even as near as your next-door neighbor. Garage sales
have soared in popularity as consumers discover treasures in
another person’s trash.
Vote Green with Your Dollars
In order to encourage greater green practices in your community
and beyond, support those businesses, merchants, services, and
organizations that exhibit sustainable policies.
To read up on the environmental practices of some national and
international corporations, visit Coop America’s Web site,
www.coopamerica.org. Then you can decide how to spend your
money in the most responsible way. Though not comprehensive,
the site offers profiles on a variety of businesses, and you can 
recommend other businesses for review.
Speak out. On a local level, whenever you patronize a business and
see an Earth-unfriendly practice, provide feedback. Share your 
concern — in a positive way — with as high-level a person as you
can find. Sure, your comments alone may not make a change, but if
the merchant receives a stream of communication repeating the
same message, he may get a hint and make a change. One woman
e-mailed a national chain grocery about their stocking larger sizes
of products to reduce packaging. She likes to think she had a role
in the addition of large-tub yogurts to the single-serve cups. And
she just may have.
