Preface
A
fter we retired from our respective jobs as regional machin-
ery specialists for the petrochemical segment of one of the 
world’s largest multinational petrochemical and oil refining 
corporations, we teamed up to write several successful texts on 
equipment reliability and failure analysis. Our writing tasks were 
facilitated by a similar career focus on machinery failure avoidance. 
Fred Geitner represented the corporate reliability interests in Canada 
and Heinz Bloch did similar work in the United States. As coauthors 
we carried over into “semi-retirement” what we had learned in over 
100 man-years of work exposure. We did indeed spend 100 man-years 
in industry after graduating from technical universities as mechanical 
engineers in the early 1960s. After authoring books on process 
machinery failure analysis and troubleshooting in the 1980s and 
1990s, we came up with the idea of doing a book on “Compressors: 
How to achieve high reliability & availability.” The emphasis is clear: 
How to achieve reliability and availability.
Why another book, and why would someone need this text? After 
all, compressor users have had (and still have) access to hundreds of 
books, and many thousands of articles dealing with gas compressor 
subjects. But we also know that an unacceptably large number of air 
and process compressors fail unnecessarily or even catastrophically 
every year. Some of the failure causes are elusive, overlooked, 
undocumented, or hidden in rather voluminous books. As involved 
compressor specialists, we are under no illusion as to what people do 
with technical books when they are overwhelmed by their sheer 
volume. Books are tools, and all tools are useless unless they are being 
used. Likewise, books are of no value until they are being read. And, 
to paraphrase Mark Twain, the person who refuses to read is as 
illiterate as the person who cannot read.
We wanted to explain some compressor issues and clearly map 
out practical remedies that worked. Remedial or preventive actions 
must be taken by operators, technicians, engineers, and managers. 
They are our collective audience and the book was written with an 
acute sense of audience awareness. In essence, we wanted to leave a 
xiii

P r e f a c e
legacy of things learned to prevent failures and yes, we believe our 
thousands of pages of previous texts have not always managed to 
do this in sharply focused, well-considered paragraphs. We wanted 
to keep this text to about 250 pages and had to make a choice of 
what to cover. So, we decided to limit ourselves to centrifugal and 
reciprocating compressors. And the 250 pages were picked on the 
basis of assuming that serious students will find time to read maybe 
two pages per day. We thought the entire book could then be read in 
about 125 workdays—perhaps between coffee or tea breaks….As 
any close review of what has been offered in the past will uncover, 
many texts were written to primarily benefit one particular job 
function, ranging from equipment operator to designer. We know 
that some compressor books are too academic, other are too vague, 
and some have failed to divulge enough details to be of lasting value. 
Some books, hopefully none of ours, contain a hidden bias and often 
appeal to a very narrow spectrum of readers. Others texts are perhaps 
influenced by a particular user’s somewhat unique experience and 
will simply not apply across a sufficiently wide spectrum.
Again, although we had written other books and articles and 
conference papers and course manuscripts on compressor reliability 
improvement, some important material is too widely dispersed to be 
readily accessible. We therefore set out to assemble, rework, condense, 
add new items, and explain the most valuable points. We wanted to 
convey the message in a widely distributed text with, hopefully, 
permanence and “staying power.” To satisfy the scope and intent 
of this book, we endeavored to keep theoretical explanations to a 
reasonable minimum, although Fred still knows more math today 
than Heinz ever knew…. Yet, we collaborated because we wanted to 
clearly describe applicable issues. These are issues that will continue 
to encroach on both compressor safety and reliability, unless people 
out there choose to no longer overlook them.
This text then tries to present a balanced view between compressor 
design, procurement, and practical compressor use. It certainly intends 
to do justice to the thermodynamic, aerodynamic, and mechanical 
issues of interest to all parties. But, again, it will do so without too 
many theoretical equations. The book briefly lays out how the two 
principal compressor categories (dynamic and positive displacement) 
function. The text then quickly moves on to guidelines and details that 
must be considered by reliability-focused compressor users. A number 
of risky omissions or shortcuts by designers, manufacturers, and user-
operators are also described. They must be processed into specifications 
that ultimately result in procuring more reliable compressors.
We know this book will help; make good use of it and remember 
that it reflects the work processes and procedures used by the very best 
and most profitable companies. That, then, leads us to acknowledge the 
assistance we received from world-class vendor-manufacturers who 
graciously agreed to let us include a large number of nonproprietary

Introduction, 
Compression 
Principles, and 
Internal Labyrinths
M
any good compressor texts start out by explaining that 
these machines depend on thermodynamic laws to oper-
ate. Compressor books then typically progress to the study 
of thermodynamics. Well, this text doesn’t do that, because we have 
not planned to add to the body of literature that delves into the aca-
demic and mathematical treatment of compressors. In this book we 
want to keep strictly in mind the goal of capturing topics that are not 
readily accessible. We want compressor troubleshooting and repair to 
deal with failure avoidance topics and issues. We also want to put our 
spotlight on tricks of the trade that are often overlooked. From per-
sonal experience, we know that these items, and especially the spot-
lighted areas, deserve to be captured. They should be of interest to 
a very wide spectrum of readers; we call this target audience the 
reliability-focused professional community.
Most of our readers know why compressors are used in modern 
industry, but we’ll briefly recap the obvious reasons for their use. We 
also wish to cite here a mere handful of general principles for the 
benefit of readers with little or no prior exposure to compressors. 
However, we want to be clear as to what this text can do and will do. 
Access to other learning or “looking up details” may be needed if our 
comments are too brief.
Density and Compression Ratios
Compressors take a certain amount of gas and increase its pressure 
from one level (suction pressure) to another level (discharge pressure). 
In doing so, the volume of the gas will be reduced, its temperature 
1

will increase, and its mass will stay the same. A pound of gas at an 
absolute pressure of 145 psia will have less volume than a pound of 
the same gas at 14.5 psia, but it’s still a pound. Recall that a pound of 
goose feathers weighs as much as a pound of steel; although the 
authors admit that they would rather be struck in the head by a 
pound of goose feathers than a pound of steel. Anyway, mass can 
neither be created nor can it be destroyed, except in a nuclear reac-
tion, which is really an altogether different branch of physics. Because 
Albert Einstein has already explained this, we don’t have to go there.
Back to our particular example where we have assumed a dis-
charge pressure of 145 psia—pounds per square inch absolute. And, 
assuming we had a suction pressure of 14.5 psia, the compression 
ratio would be 145:14.5 = 10:1. Note that we must do these calculations 
in units of absolute pressure. If we had attempted to do this in units of 
gage pressure (psig), it would have been 130.5 psig divided by 0 psig. 
We vaguely remember that it’s illegal to divide by zero and we had 
promised our publishers that we would not do anything illegal. 
That’s why we will always calculate pressure ratios in absolute units.
It is not normally possible to achieve a compression ratio of 10:1 
in a single compression stage. If we tried to do that, the temperature 
of the gas would go far too high. At excessively high temperatures we 
would have to opt for very expensive metallurgies. Also, too much 
energy would go into heat and the compression process would be 
rather inefficient. Moreover, at the resulting high temperatures there 
would be thermal growth because metals expand when heated and 
contract when cooled. So, we are limited to stay more or less near an 
average compression ratio of 3:1 per stage in positive-displacement 
machines and somewhat lower in centrifugal compressors. With a 
lighter gas and in centrifugal compressors, the achievable ratios 
might be closer to 2:1. With heavier gases one might occasionally see 
compression ratios approaching 4:1.
If we need to achieve a compression ratio of 10:1 but are concerned 
about high temperatures, we could take the gas discharged from a 
compression stage and lead it into a heat exchanger. After cooling it we 
could pipe it to the intake of the next stage and perhaps increase the gas 
pressure by a ratio of 3.4:1. Now we would perhaps get it to a final 
discharge pressure of 3 × 3.4 = 10.2 times the original suction pressure.
Well, not quite. Actually, we would expect the final discharge 
pressure to be only 10 times (not 10.2 times) original suction. That’s 
because we figured there was a frictional loss or pressure drop in the 
heat exchangers, and we assumed that this pressure drop amounted 
to about 0.2 psi.
Gas density [Eq. (1.1)] varies in close proportion to gas molecular 
weight:

where	
P = gas pressure (absolute)
	
T = gas temperature (absolute)
	
MW = gas molecular weight
	
R = gas constant
So, if some gases are denser or thicker than others, it is because 
they have different molecular weights. Amedeo Avogadro, in 1811, 
hypothesized that two given samples of an ideal gas, at the same tem-
perature, pressure, and volume, contain the same number of mole-
cules. Thus, the number of molecules or atoms in a specific volume of 
gas is independent of their size or the molar mass of the gas. While at 
standard conditions of temperature and pressure, the molecules of two 
different gases will take up the same volume, the denser gas molecule 
will be heavier. We might liken this to a ping-pong ball and a golf ball. 
Both take up the same space, but the golf ball is denser and will weigh 
more. And the ping-pong ball is easier to compress than the golf ball.
Heat and Mass Concepts Simplified
It is also worth mentioning that some gases build up or retain more 
heat than others. It’s a relationship that is often expressed in a specific 
heat or k-value. If we really needed to know more about it, we could 
easily find it explained in books. And common sense always helps. If 
we applied a finite amount of heat to the lower portions of both a 
ping-pong ball and a golf ball, we would not expect this heat to travel 
through each ball at the same rate of speed and the two surfaces 
might not ever reach the same steady-state temperature. Each dissi-
pates heat differently or radiates it into the surrounding environment 
at different rates.
Also, the greater the mass flow rate of gas we wanted to elevate 
from one pressure to a higher pressure, the more energy we would 
have to put into the gas. Mass flow is throughput; it is often expressed 
in kilograms per second, which is about the same as 2.2 lb/s. In the 
context of compressors, energy is generally measured in either kilo-
watts or horsepower.
The Concept of “Head” and Other Parameters
Another common measure is “compression head,” generally abbrevi-
ated as “head.” Head is a term used in computing the amount of 
energy that must be added to each mass unit of gas to produce the 
desired pressure increase. The customary units are foot-pounds of 
energy per pound of gas, which then simplifies to “feet.” Head is bor-
rowed from the field of liquid hydraulics where the height of a col-
umn of liquid, in feet, is equivalent to the energy theoretically needed 
to produce a static pressure at the base of the column. The concept is

being carried over to compressible gas technology, and pressure ratio 
is substituted for pressure at the base of the column. Molecular 
weight is substituted for liquid specific gravity and an arrangement 
of exponents [the n in Eq. (1.2)] is used. Suitable exponents account 
for both the thermal behavior of a particular gas and the unavoidable 
inefficiency of a compressor.

One might increase the volume throughput by making the com-
pressor larger. Or, one could speed up a compressor to increase its 
throughput volume. But there are interesting limits to these moves 
and Mach number is one of these. It is the ratio of two speeds and is 
thus a dimensionless number. Although not exactly as defined in 
physics, in a process gas compressor the Mach number is the speed of 
the gas moving through the machine at a particular location, divided 
by the speed of sound as it is in that process gas at its particular phys-
ical conditions, including those of temperature and pressure. Allow-
able Mach numbers differ with gas density and excessively high 
numbers adversely affect compressor performance.
Gas density is influenced by gas molecular weight and pressures. 
The maximum allowable velocity of a gas rushing through compressor 
impellers, stationary return bends, and nozzles is limited and is quite 
obviously a function of gas conditions. Moreover, elevating gas pres-
sures tends to require thicker compressor walls than needed at low 
pressures. All of these constraints must be taken into account by the 
diligent designer.
All gas compressors, regardless of type, will deliver a compressed 
gas with an increased discharge temperature. Therefore, not all 
the energy put into the gas will be converted to increased pressure. 
The “practical” energy conversion is called polytropic head; it could be 
described as the intangible measurement of energy density imparted 
to a gas stream by the compressor. Adding this energy results in a 
pressure increase as the gas passes through the machine. Some head 
calculations assume (quite erroneously) that no heat is added to the 
gas. Calculations labeled “polytropic,” meaning more versatile and 

I n t r o d u c t i o n  a n d  C o m p r e s s i o n  P r i n c i p l e s

affecting many kinds or types, are more realistic. In the polytropic 
method this energy density calculation takes into account heat being 
generated in the process. The polytropic head generated by a given 
impeller is a function of gas molecular weight, the thermal behavior—
specific heat—of the gas, compressor efficiency, compressor inlet tem-
perature, and compression ratio.2
In a centrifugal compressor the ratio of specific heats (cv/cp, the 
k-value) has marked influence on the design. Assume for the sake of 
illustration that a single impeller compresses alternately two gases of 
equal density, one having a k-value of 1.1, the other of 1.4. As compres-
sion takes place, temperature increases are different in gases with a 1.1 
or 1.3 k-value versus a gas with a 1.4 k-value (Fig. 1.1). Consequently, 
the average density or specific gravity of the lower k-value gases will 
diminish less than that of the high k-value gas. The result is that the 
pressure generated by the single impeller under these identical condi-
tions of peripheral speed and volume at inlet will be less for the high 
k-value gas than for the low k-value gas.3
In Eq. (1.2), the exponent n incorporates this factor k and we 
might just let it go with that. There is also a general rule of thumb 
that assumes that a single impeller will accommodate an unlimited 
mix of these parameters, up to 10,000 ft of head per impeller. If a 
calculation using Eq. (1.2) showed head between 10,000 and 20,000 ft 
one would require two impellers in series, or if it were between 
20,000 and 30,000 ft, one would build a three-stage compressor. For 
somewhere between 80,000 and 90,000 ft, nine stages of compression 
would be needed, and so forth. Up to 11 stages of compression have

been accommodated in a single compressor casing. If more stages of 
compression are required, then another casing needs to be added. 
Some compressor trains have as many as five or even six bodies. 
A compressor train with an electric motor driver, a speed-up gear, 
two compressor bodies, another speed-up gear, and a third compressor 
casing would comprise six bodies.
Depending on thermal behavior or specific heat, and also depend-
ing on inlet temperature and compression ratio, the compressor dis-
charge temperature may be too high for a particular metallurgy. In 
that instance, intercooling is often provided after typically three of 
four stages of compression. The compressed gas is then cooled and 
routed so as to reenter the compressor into the next section of 
upstream stages. (Note: For an excellent overview of the many avail-
able options consult Ref. 4.)
Positive Displacement versus Dynamic Compressors
Compressors are separated into positive displacement types and 
dynamic types. Reciprocating compressors are positive displacement 
machines whereas centrifugal and axial compressors are “dynamic” 
machines. All are involved in energy transfer and all require a mea-
sure of maintenance or similar upkeep. Their fields of application 
overlap and are shown in Fig. 1.2.
A few principal parts of reciprocating compressors are high-
lighted in Fig. 1.3. Because gas is compressed as the piston moves

back and forth in the cylinder, the machine is called double acting. 
Small air compressors are occasionally designed as single-acting 
machines, meaning that the gas (air, in this instance) is being com-
pressed only as the piston advances. The cross-section of a single-
acting compressor is simpler than the partial one shown in Fig. 1.3 for 
a double-acting process gas machine.
While there are many reciprocating or rotary positive displace-
ment compressors used in the lower flow rate services, high flow rate 
process gas machines are typically centrifugal compressors. There are 
also axial compressors for the movement of large volumes of gases. 
All are a vital link in the conversion of raw materials into refined or 
finished products, and also for economically transferring energy 
from one form into another. Some compressors are used for the 
extraction of raw materials in mining operations, others are applied 
in conservation of energy by reinjecting natural gas, or in secondary 
recovery processes in crude oil-producing fields, or for oil recovery 
from shale and tar sand deposits. Compressors also deliver reaction 
air, oxygen, and other gases in virtually every chemical, gas process-
ing and refining facility.

The economy and feasibility of the numerous compressor applica-
tions depend on high equipment reliability. A particular segment of 
our text will deal with the need to address reliable operation of auxil-
iary equipment, such as lubricating oil and seal support systems, or 
surge control devices. In general, selection takes into account the 
required gas throughput, desired efficiency, and the space taken up by 
a compressor—its “footprint.” A good selection routine is heavily 
influenced by maintenance philosophies and the frequency of planned 
or budgeted shutdowns. In general, the less expensive machines 
require more frequent maintenance-repair-overhaul (MRO) shutdowns. 
One of the chapters on reciprocating compressors (see Chapters 12 
through 15) will deal with the issue in greater detail. 
The considerable overlap between machine types was noted in 
Fig. 1.2. There is overlap in throughput capacity or even in achievable 
pressures; one of the chapters on centrifugal compressors will explain 
that in somewhat greater detail.
Before contrasting the different types of compression machinery, 
we should define reciprocating compressors as machines where 
crankshaft rotation is transferred to one or more pistons that move 
back-and-forth in a cylinder or cylinders. Dynamic or turbocompres-
sors are rotating machines with impellers (Figs. 1.4 through 1.6). They 
could also be rotating machines with all freestanding blades, or rotors 
with freestanding blades in the lower stages feeding gas to higher 
stage impellers in the same compressor casing (Fig. 1.7).
The casings of dynamic compressors are either horizontally split 
or vertically split. A six-stage horizontally split machine is depicted 
in Fig. 1.5. To gain access to the rotor, the entire upper half of the cas-
ing will have to be removed. As the designation implies, the split line 
between upper and lower casing halves is quite obviously horizontal. 
The nozzle orientation is downward and nozzles are part of the lower 
casing. If the nozzles had been provided on the upper casing, the con-
nected piping would have to be dismantled before the upper casing 
could be lifted off for rotor maintenance. With nozzles on the lower 
casing, piping can remain in place while performing rotor mainte-
nance; however, the entire turbocompressor will have to be mounted 
on an elevated platform (“mezzanine”) to accommodate the down-
ward nozzles and their associated pipe works. 
Note the mirror-image orientation of the three lower stages on the 
right relative to the three higher stages on the left in this illustration. 
This is done for thrust balance.
An eight-stage vertically split turbocompressor is shown in 
Fig. 1.6. The casing is essentially a thick-walled pipe, and vertically 
split compressors are often called “barrel” machines. To gain access 
to the rotor, one or both of the massive end walls will have to be 
removed and the rotor and its surrounding diaphragms pulled out 
axially from the pipe-like casing. The designation “vertically split” is 
a bit misleading and is chosen to distinguish it from the horizontally

internal labyrinths were also identified earlier (Fig. 1.4).] 
Internal Labyrinth Seals
The internal labyrinths of modern centrifugal compressors are care-
fully designed and only material selection is more important than 
design.7 The original or as-designed clearance in old-style aluminum 
labyrinths (Fig. 1.7) is lost after a rubbing event; even shaft damage is 
often noted (Fig. 1.8).

Plastic sealing teeth configured to deflect and move out of the 
way are shown in Fig. 1.9. They are considered rub tolerant and can 
deflect. However, they do generate heat upon prolonged contact. 
Although wear may be limited, these plastic parts are rarely suitable 
for long run-lengths expected of major process gas machines.7 
As a general rule, the seal combination of Fig. 1.10 deserves our 
attention. It incorporates best heat dissipation with labyrinth teeth 
integrated in the shaft and an abradable seal material located oppo-
site it.7 Finally, we show two examples of mounting an abradable 
material in a centrifugal compressor (Fig. 1.11).
All eight stages (labeled “2” in Fig. 1.6) are facing in the same 
direction. A balance piston near the entry to stage 4 (on the left) makes 
it possible to use a relatively small thrust bearing near the right side 
of this compressor.

Horizontally split machines are generally used for lower discharge 
pressures; vertically split machines are needed at high pressure rat-
ings. Nozzle orientation on vertically split “barrel” compressors is far 
less critical because maintenance rarely requires disturbing the pip-
ing. The nozzle locations may be varied to gain space needed for side-
stream nozzles, or to accommodate nozzles needed for routing gas to 
and from external heat exchangers. 
Vertically split compressors are sometimes placed on mezzanines 
to facilitate gravity drainage of lubricating oil and other fluids. This 
style of compressor casing is often placed at the end of a compressor 
train and free space is allocated to facilitate rotor removal.
Figure 1.12 shows a compressor rotor with seven axial (freestand-
ing blade) and two centrifugal stages. Axial blading allows high vol-
umes and moderate compression ratios; radial impellers can produce 
higher differential pressures. Combining the two approaches on a 
single rotor often represents an optimized design.
Turbocompressors handle any gas and almost any capacity. There 
are far more centrifugal compressors in service than axial compres-
sors, although axial compressors are capable of the largest through-
put volumes. Large process units, such as ammonia plants, ethylene 
plants, and base-load LNG plants became technically and economi-
cally feasible because of turbocompressor developments. In fact, an 
entire industry centers on the exploitation of hydrocarbons from oil 
and natural gas. By the mid to late 1900s this had resulted in hun-
dreds of new processes that apply turbocompressors. 

14	
C h a p t e r  O n e
Preinvesting with Future Uprating in Mind
It is quite customary to purchase centrifugal compressors with 
future upgrading in mind. For increased throughput one might 
replace the very first impeller with a new, wider one. The present 
first impeller would be relocated to be in position 2 on the rotor, and 
so forth. The last impeller on the old (original) rotor would be dis-
carded; in its place on the now new (or uprated) rotor would be the 
impeller which on the original rotor was next-to-last. However, so 
as not to exceed allowable Mach numbers in the compressor noz-
zles, the compressor casing would be purchased with future uprat-
ing in mind. The discharge nozzle, especially, might be specified to 
be somewhat larger than initially needed for the gas throughput 
originally specified. The incremental cost for preinvesting in larger 
nozzles versus specifying only the originally needed nozzles is gen-
erally quite low.
Reciprocating compressors are generally used for low flow vol-
umes and/or relatively high discharge pressures.

What We Have Learned
The properties of the gases handled, the flow rates, the pressure dif-
ferences to be overcome, and the operating temperatures can vary 
within very wide limits, depending on the type of service and pro-
duction capacity. 
Compressor selection takes all these into account but is not lim-
ited to the obvious. Among the lesser known factors are compressor 
locations and spare parts availability, climate factors that may affect 
cooling, availability of a trained workforce, toleration of shutdown 
duration and frequency, etc. These, together with failure analysis and 
troubleshooting, will be covered in some of the chapters in this text. 
Internal labyrinths should be made of a frangible material. If 
rotor contact occurs, the material will fracture into relatively small 
pieces and pass through the machine. Metals used for labyrinth seals 
in older compressors often have a tendency to seize or gall.
Preinvesting in future uprate capability is easy to cost-justify.

Selection Factors 
for Process 
Compressors
E
very style or type of compressor was developed to serve a par-
ticular purpose and the collective references have devoted 
hundreds of thousands of pages to the topic.1,2 The overall 
performance trends of three prominent compressor styles are shown 
in Fig. 2.1. In each case, our interest is concentrated on a design point 
defined as the point where a desired 100 percent pressure perfor-
mance meets 100 percent gas throughput performance. The illustra-
tion shows that as the pressure output of a positive displacement 
(primarily reciprocating and rotary screw style) compressor is 
increased, the volume being compressed decreases slightly. It can be 
reasoned that some of the pressurized gas slips back as “blow-by” 
from the discharge side to the suction side of a positive displacement 
machine.
Centrifugal and axial compressors are called “dynamic” com-
pressors. They produce a pressure ratio, i.e., head—a pressure devel-
opment capability as a function of speed and impeller diameter in 
centrifugal, or blade length in axial compressors. Again looking at 
the intersection of 100 percent pressure and 100 percent flow, any 
increase in pressure ratio or discharging the compressed gas into a 
region of higher pressure will follow the curve. For the centrifugal 
compressor with typical performance represented in Fig. 2.1 a maxi-
mum ratio of 115 percent cannot be exceeded; also, as pressures are 
increased from 100 to 115 percent, the flow-rate or compressor through-
put will decline from previously 100 to perhaps 72 or 75 percent. An 
axial compressor will perform somewhere between the centrifugal 
and positive displacement machines; their generalized performance 
characteristics are plotted in Fig. 2.1. It can be said that these approx-
imations are reasonably representative of what we find in process 
industry applications. However, the specifics can vary quite a bit.

Whenever minimizing capital cost is of greatest importance, 
Table 2.2 attempts to give somewhat elementary guidance. It is fair to 
point out that cost-of-ownership (synonymous with life cycle cost) 
includes issues and considerations that go well beyond initial cost. In 
fact, initial cost can be less than 8 percent of overall cost. Operating 
and maintenance costs inevitably make up the bulk of total cost of 
ownership for process gas compressors. Reliability-focused users 
will not make compressor selection on initial cost considerations 
alone. They make sure that cost estimates reflect, and capital budgets 
relate to, only reliable equipment. It is a widely prevalent mistake to 
base one’s project estimates on lowest initial cost of machines and 
then demand or expect high equipment reliability. 
Highly reliable compressors will cost more than marginally reli-
able ones. Compressors with marginal reliability will either have to 
be shut down frequently for preventive maintenance or will fail cata-
strophically if needed maintenance work is deferred or omitted alto-
gether. It may be possible to use condition monitoring instruments to 
obtain advance warning of component distress; however, it is doubt-
ful if engaging in all manner of predictive maintenance (PdM) is 
more cost-effective than buying a more reliable compressor.
The operating environment of a compressor may affect the differ-
ent compressors to a different degree. Likewise, it can be said that 
attributes and capabilities of certain compressors influence the envi-
ronment which a particular compressor then creates. 
Nine environmental considerations are tabulated in Table 2.3; 
note again that the relative categories or rankings E, G, F, and P are

Table 2.4 gives generalized maintenance cost rankings; three 
important listings make up the illustration and reciprocating process 
compressors are given a seemingly low ranking. However, and as 
compiled in Table 2.5, reciprocating compressors still have certain 
attributes that can place them at the top of competing machines.
One might increase the volume throughput by making the com-
pressor larger. Or, one could speed up a compressor to increase its 
throughput volume. Elevating gas pressures tend to require thicker 
compressor walls than needed at low pressures.

What We Have Learned
There are trade-offs among compressors and no one type or configu-
ration fits all circumstances. The maintenance philosophies and 
uptime requirements of a particular project determine the selection, 
and many factors should be considered. All are based on experience.
Purchasing blindly on the basis of low bids and rapid delivery 
may compromise compressor reliability. All factors are important and 
must be given consideration before making procurement decisions.

CHAPTER 3
Operating 
Characteristics of 
Turbocompressors
T
his text is not meant to duplicate the hundreds of other texts on 
compressor operation. Instead, its intended function is to syn-
thesize and to address the needs of our target audience. As 
authors, we believe the operating characteristics of turbocompressors 
must be understood if safe and efficient operation is to be obtained. 
The relationship between the inlet volume and the discharge 
pressure of a centrifugal compressor is called its characteristic curve; 
the terms characteristic curve and performance curve are used inter-
changeably for these curve-shaped representations (Fig. 3.1). 
The discharge pressure developed by a centrifugal compressor is 
always equal to the total system resistance; it is this resistance (com-
posed of valves and piping) that must be overcome. When the system 
resistance (or pressure to be overcome) changes, the rate of flow 
through the compressor will automatically adjust itself to equal the 
new resistance. This automatic process occurs over the entire operat-
ing range of the compressor, within its limitations.
There is a maximum volume that any compressor will deliver. As 
seen in Fig. 3.1, the characteristic curve tends to become vertical at 
maximum volume. At this point, called “stonewall,” flow cannot 
increase despite a great reduction in system resistance. 
With decreasing flow and toward the left side of the performance 
curves, there is a minimum point called “surge” (or surge limit) below 
which unstable operation will result.
Surge
Surge represents an unstable region of flow (Fig. 3.1). All centrifugal 
compressors have a flow at which maximum pressure generation is 
possible. Further reduction in flow beyond this point results in a 

24	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
decreasing discharge pressure. When this occurs, the pressure in the 
system exceeds that produced by the compressor and momentary 
reversal of flow occurs. As this momentary flow reversal reduces the 
system pressure, the compressor will rapidly build up pressure. With 
pressure regained, flow will again proceed in the normal direction. 
Oscillation back and forth (surge) will continue until the system resis-
tance, or discharge pressure, is reduced. Surge cycles can have dura-
tions from 0.05 seconds to 5 or more seconds. All kinds of variables 
are at work and, while some machines survive days of surge, some 
will fail after less than 60 seconds of severe surge. 
If process flow is less than the compressor surge, the compressor 
should be operated in a stable region and excess flow blown off or 
bypassed (recycled) through a fast-acting surge control valve. For air 
applications, this excess can be blown off to atmosphere. For process 
gas applications where the gas cannot be lost, the excess can be recycled 
or bypassed through a cooler (also called a heat exchanger) back to the 
compressor inlet. The surge control valve can be operated either manu-
ally or with automatic controls. Quite obviously, fast-acting automatic 
controls are much preferred on valuable process gas compressors.
Compressor Speed
The characteristic curve is fixed for a constant speed. For a variable 
speed driver, such as a turbine, the curve location will vary with a 
change in speed—see lower curve in Fig. 3.2. However, the “new” 
curve is essentially parallel to the upper curves. Speed variation is an 
efficient means of compressor control to meet several operating flows 
and pressures. With a fixed system resistance, flow will vary directly

with speed, while head varies as the square of the speed, and horse-
power as the cube of the speed (Table 3.1).
Centrifugal and axial compressor performance changes can be 
estimated from the fan laws, also called affinity laws (Table 3.1). 
A numerical example is used in Table 3.2.
Changes in RPM (revolutions per minute) are most often used to 
adjust compressor performance, obtain pressure rise, modify through-
put, etc. We can observe how speed changes affect other parameters 
in Fig. 3.3. If, as an example, the speed (RPM) is increased from previ-
ously 100 percent to now 110 percent of design, the discharge tem-
perature (Td), head developed (H ), power demand (HP), weight flow, 
volumetric throughput, and the input power demand will all increase 
in different proportions.

Inlet Pressure and Temperature
The characteristic curve (Fig. 3.3) of a given compressor has a fixed 
pressure ratio (absolute discharge pressure divided by absolute inlet 
pressure) at any given flow. The back pressure in this illustration is 
uncontrolled. If inlet pressure is reduced, the discharge pressure will 
be reduced equal to the new inlet pressure times the pressure ratio. In 
addition, the horsepower will vary directly with inlet pressure, and 
will decrease proportionally. With an increased inlet pressure, both 
discharge pressure and horsepower will increase.
An increase in inlet temperature will result in an opposite reac-
tion to the discharge pressure and horsepower; it will cause a lower-
ing of these two parameters. Conversely, decreased temperature will 
Example of its use:
Let’s say the RPM was increased by 10% and we wanted to know what the 
horsepower increase would be:
•  HP2 gas/HP1 gas = (RPM2/RPM1)3 (assumes head and flow allowed to rise).
•  HP2 gas = HP1 gas × (RPM2/RPM1)3.
•  HP2 gas = HP1 gas × (1.10)3 = 1.33 × HP1 gas.
•  The gas horsepower would thus increase by about 33%.

the formula:
Q = (W ) × (10.729) × (T1) × (Z1)/(P1) × (MW)—actual cubic feet 
per minute, ACFM
Effect of Gas Properties
Changes in gas mixture properties will affect the compressor charac-
teristic curve. For a given inlet flow, a decrease in the molecular 
weight will reduce both the discharge pressure and horsepower. An 
increase in the molecular weight will result in an increase in both the 
pressure and horsepower.
A decrease in the ratio of specific heat will increase both discharge 
pressure and horsepower. Conversely, an increase in k-value pro-
duces a decrease in pressure and horsepower. This is summarized in 
Table 3.3.
Effect of Speed Changes
Recall that the back pressure in Fig. 3.3 was left uncontrolled. If the 
discharge pressure is controlled by a back pressure valve, the head 
will remain constant because suction and discharge pressures remain 
constant. 

28	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
As speed is increased, the power demand will increase as the 
cube of speed changes; weight and volume flow will increase in the 
same proportions as the power input. 
Changing Suction Temperature
The effects of changing suction temperature were given in Table 3.3 
and are restated in Fig. 3.4. An increase in suction temperature 
increases the head required to generate pressure. Compressor speed 
to supply head increases and more power is needed. Suction flow 
increases, but because of lower density the resulting weight flow 
decreases. The discharge temperature also increases. In essence:

a demand for gas occurs.
•  Knee – Slope change rapidly before “stonewall.” Operation inefficient,

to another.

•  Stonewall – Vertical portion curve, defines maximum flow rate 
compressor canpass. As approach sonic speed turbulence, shockwaves, 
flow separation occur.

rate results in a flow reversal and unstable operation.

Kelvin temperature.

Keeping suction temperatures as low as possible is important if com-
pressor throughput (weight flow) is to be maximized.
Finally, the effects of changes in suction pressure can be visual-
ized from Fig. 3.5 and frequently used terms summarized in Fig. 3.6. 
The x-axis in Fig. 3.5 displays suction pressure percentage change 
relative to the original design. Assuming we wanted to maintain a 
certain discharge pressure, increasing the suction pressure causes the 
gas density and throughput mass (weight flow) to increase. The 
required head H, speed N, volume flow Q, and discharge tempera-
ture Td will decrease. On the downside, energy demand will increase 
as the weight flow increases.
What We Have Learned
Experience tells us that surge must be avoided; to avoid surge one 
installs surge abatement measures. Surge abatement is typically 
achieved by rapidly opening a large bypass valve in a pipe loop from 
compressor discharge back to suction. This ensures that gas flow 
through the compressor stays to the right of the surge limit in Fig. 3.1.
Operator training must cover compressor performance and how 
changes in one parameter affect other parameters of interest. In the 
age of computerization and easy simulation, the various parameters 
deserve to be displayed in the operator’s control room; showing them 
in dynamic, animated form is best.

CHAPTER 4
Wet and Dry 
Gas Seals for 
Centrifugal 
Compressors
S
haft seals keep the compressed gas from leaking out and the 
need for leakage prevention may include process economy, 
safety, and environmental protection. Moreover, the process gas 
will usually have to be kept away from the compressor bearings. In 
essence, seals are located between the compressed gas and the bear-
ings; a number of different sealing arrangements and configurations 
are found in industry. An overview of four principal seal types is pro-
vided in Fig. 4.1. Within each of the four principal types one finds 
numerous variants.
Some wet face seals incorporate a stationary, a rotating, and a 
floating ring; others incorporate only a rotating ring clamped to the 
shaft and a spring-loaded nonrotating face with the springs anchored 
in a housing assembly.
Dry gas seals are mechanical face-type seals available as single, 
double, and tandem models. However, dry gas seals should not be 
confused with the internal labyrinth seals that separate individual 
stages inside a compressor casing (see also Chapter 1, Figs. 1.4 and 1.6).
For over five decades, centrifugal compressors have benefited from 
face and bushing-type mechanical seal technology. The early compres-
sors of the 1950s often struggled with cumbersome labyrinth sealing 
and gas eductor arrangements. But, in the 1960s, many labyrinth con-
figurations were rapidly replaced by a variety of liquid-lubricated seals 
that introduced small amounts of seal oil between either the sealing 
faces or the small gaps between stationary and floating sealing bush-
ings. American Petroleum Industry Standard 617 has for many years 
outlined different sealing arrangements and “generic” dry gas seals are

included in this important and well-established API-617 compressor 
standard. User preferences differ, but each type of seal has its applica-
tion range, as shown in Table 4.1.1 In general, dry gas seals are favored 
in new installations. On existing installations, wet (liquid) seals merit 
replacing only if they are troublesome and if good experience refer-
ences are available for dry gas seals in the same service.
The Case against Wet Seals
In 2010, a consulting engineer summarized his experience; it appar-
ently favored dry gas seals in a wide range of applications. For wet 
seals he reported the following:2

1.	 High seal oil consumption, even when new; typically about 
5 gpd (gallons per day) per seal, for a total of 10 gpd per 
typical compressor. After 1 year in service, this will aver-
age about 15 to 20 gpd. For combined lube-seal systems 
(not always possible), the leakage losses are reduced, but a 
total of at least 2 gpd are lost into the compressor itself on 
an average-size machine. (Contaminated lube oil may 
damage compressor bearings, leading to vibration and 
downtime.)
	
2.	 Wet seal systems require more operator attention (man-hours 
of labor) because the system’s sour seal oil drainage must be 
physically inspected and measured on combined systems 
and there are many active components in the seal oil system. 
	
3.	 Incremental energy requirements due to parasitic losses on 
wet seals are typically ~30 HP (total) on average-size 10,000 hp 
compressors. Adding seal oil pump energy (~35 HP) will 
increase the total energy increment to 65 HP.
	
4.	 Hydraulic surges are a potential hazard on wet seal systems, 
some more so than others. This can lead to seal face damage 
and reduced component life. (Manufacturers rarely mention 
this risk and seldom size the oil accumulators properly. Even 
then, bladder-type accumulators tend to become frequent 
maintenance items—partly due to internal gas leakage and 
elastomer failures.)
	
5.	 Life of wet seal bushing is 2 to 4 years on average; however, 
some wet bushing seals reach 6 years with well-designed 
late-generation components.
	
6.	 Because seal bushings do wear (microscopic abrasive parti-
cles can accumulate at the bushing seal edge and grind the 
shaft mechanically), experience points to the advisability of 
precautionary repairs on every second seal intervention. At 
that time the complete rotor must be removed to repair dam-
aged shaft regions, even though the shaft is hardened. (It 
should be noted that late-generation Isocarbon® liquid film 
face seals do not have this problem.)
	
7.	 With some wet seal systems there are four pumps to inspect 
and maintain on each compressor lube/seal oil skid; two are 
seal oil and two are lube oil pumps.
	
8.	 Significant gas leakage losses to flare from the sour seal oil 
traps may have to be considered. Unless a flare gas recovery 
unit is available or the gas is reintroduced at the compressor 
suction, gas losses can be as high as 30 times the equivalent 
dry gas seal loss. Up to 75 scfm per seal have been reported 
for a 10,000 hp compressor in average condition. 

36	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
	
9.	 With wet seals considerable instrumentation complications 
exist because many control devices are needed. The cost of 
instrument maintenance can be high. 
	 10.	 Troubleshooting oil seals requires a highly qualified engi-
neering or senior technical staff. Experience shows that seal 
oil system design/installation/maintenance problems are 
not always resolved and constant vigilance is required. 
(Reference 2 concludes that gas seals require lesser skills.)
	 11.	 Contamination of the process gas path, such as heat exchang-
ers and catalyst beds downstream of the compressor is often 
experienced. This can become a burdensome cost to the plant. 
On a per-compressor basis the yearly reduction in efficiency 
of heat exchangers on a propane system can easily incur 
$50,000 to $100,000 (year 2010 valuation) due to the resulting 
cooling losses.
	 12.	 Float traps on seal oil systems can become a maintenance 
issue.
	 13.	 Faulty level controllers can risk worrisome gas leakage to 
atmosphere.
	 14.	 For compressors equipped with bushing-type seals, no backup 
seal is available in case of power outage (loss of seal oil). As a 
consequence, emergency power is required for safe operation 
or an immediate shutdown is required. It should be noted that 
Ref. 3 states that dry seals have a safe record in this regard due 
to the availability of secondary sealing.
	 15.	 The plot plan (“footprint”) needed by wet seal auxiliary sys-
tems is usually relatively large. The compressor skid itself is 
physically smaller and less expensive for machines equipped 
with gas seal systems.
How Gas Seals Function
There are many functional similarities between gas seals and their pre-
decessors. These predecessors include many variants of face, bushing, 
and floating ring seals. Yet, there are also features that differ. For 
instance, the seal face of the rotating mating ring can be divided into a 
grooved area at the high-pressure side and a dam area at the low-
pressure side (Fig. 4.2). The shallow grooves are often laser etched, 
spark eroded, or chemically milled. A typical depth is ~0.0003 in = 
0.008 m, quite obviously achieved through highly precise machining 
operations. T-shaped, V-shaped (bi-directional), and L-shaped (unidi-
rectional) grooves have been produced; each configuration has its 
advantages and disadvantages. A stationary sliding ring is pressed axi-
ally against the mating ring by both spring forces and sealing pressure.

W e t  a n d  D r y  G a s  S e a l s 	
37
The sealing gap is located between the mating ring and the slid-
ing ring. For proper noncontacting operation, these two rings have to 
be separated by a gas film acting against the closing forces in the seal-
ing gap. The gas film is achieved by the pumping action of the grooves 
and the throttling effect of the sealing dam. Groove geometry is criti-
cal for trouble-free operation of the seal.
Minimizing the Risk of Sealing Problems
Dry gas sealing is obviously coming into prominence and deserves 
consideration. However, specification, review, purchasing, and instal-
lation of a dry seal support system cannot be left to chance. A thor-
ough review of the owner’s facility and the particular process unit in 
which the compressor will be installed may well be the key to mini-
mizing gas seal failure events. In order of importance, the following 
factors should be considered in examining dry seal support systems 
for centrifugal compressors:
Gas Composition: Understanding the actual gas composition and 
true operating condition is essential, yet often overlooked. For exam-
ple, it is necessary to understand when and where phase changes start 
and that condensed liquids must not be allowed in the sealing gas.

indicate sense of rotation (Ref. 4).

38	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
Commissioning procedures and control system design must be 
thoroughly understood:
	
1.	 Is clean and dry buffer gas available at all anticipated com-
pressor speeds?
	
2.	 Is the seal protected from bearing oil?
	
3.	 How is the compressor pressurized or depressurized?
	
4.	 How is the machine brought up to operating speed and how 
will the seal react?
	
5.	 Are all operating and maintenance personnel fully familiar 
with the compressor maintenance and operating manual?
	
6.	 Is the full control system included and adequately described 
in these write-ups?
	
7.	 Are the key elements of the system design understood and do 
they include buffer gas conditioning, heating, filtration, regu-
lation (flow vs. pressure), and monitoring?
Before opting for dry gas seals in retrofit situations, ask if the 
apparently flawed liquid seals really represent the best the vendor 
was able to offer. The claims of competing vendors and claims made 
for different styles of seals must be checked against actual experience. 
In some cases these checks lead to the purchase of late-generation 
liquid film face seals instead of gas seals. The areas of safety and reli-
ability must always be given special consideration.
Seal Safety and Reliability
Positive sealing of the compressor during emergencies must always 
be assessed. In the event that the gas pressure in the compressor cas-
ing exceeds that of the seal oil pressure, shutdown pistons in advanced 
face seal assemblies exert a force proportional to the gas pressure to 
keep the seal faces closed and prevent gas release to the environment.
Dry gas seals may or may not provide positive gas sealing if the 
seal faces are damaged or distorted. The backup seal may show rea-
sonable performance under low pressure but may fail to perform 
under higher pressure if the primary seal fails.
The alarm and shutdown devices of the seal oil system must be of 
reasonable range and sensitivity and should provide reliable alarm 
and shutdown characteristics. Dry gas seal systems often rely on 
pressure switches of very low range and high sensitivity. They might 
have the tendency to malfunction or give a false sense of security. 
Make sure the system will provide a sufficiently high degree of alarm 
and shutdown performance.
Some seal configurations excel at online monitoring. The favored 
seal must allow easy verification of sound working condition. Beware 

W e t  a n d  D r y  G a s  S e a l s 	
39
of seal systems that are hampered by small diameter orifices that tend 
to plug; avoid sensitive pressure switches that often become inoper-
able. Dry gas seal failures are not as easy to detect as wet seal failures. 
As a final comment, the user must go through a rigorous cost 
justification analysis. In many cases, gas seals are a good choice only 
if you do not have to purchase the oil seal console. If this console 
already exists, it’s often difficult to justify gas seals.
With hydrocarbon gas prices escalating, it might be prudent to 
consider gas leakage rates in order to justify a conversion to gas-
lubricated seals. Also not to be overlooked are advancements in tra-
ditional oil sealing technology for centrifugal compressors. Many 
world-scale manufacturers are now marketing improved versions of 
the oil seals that were originally furnished with their compressors. 
Along these lines, one researcher suggests to study the failure 
statistics of your oil type seals and compare them with this: Current 
estimates of failure rates of gas seals are in the neighborhood of 
0.175 failures/year, meaning that we could expect a problem every 
6 years or so. At least one dry gas seal manufacturer bases recom-
mended maintenance intervals around gas seals on limits set by the 
elastomer aging process. This manufacturer suggests the following 
maintenance routine after 60 months of operation:
• Replace all elastomers
• Replace the springs
• Replace all seal faces and seats
• Carry out a static and dynamic test run on a test rig
Making Good Choices
Thus, our final advice to the reader is to make informed choices. Con-
sider gas seals only in conjunction with a clean gas supply. If your 
process gas causes the fouling deposits as shown in a later chapter 
(Figs. 12.2 and 12.4), ask critical questions of anyone offering seals for 
use with that kind of gas. If extensive microfiltration is needed, factor-
in the cost of maintaining a dry gas seal support system. Look for 
seals that will survive a reasonable amount of compressor surging. 
Consider dry gas seals that incorporate features ensuring start-up 
and acceleration to operating speed without allowing the two faces to 
make contact. If these seals are not available from your supplier, look 
beyond the usual sources.
Some innovative manufacturers are offering modern dry gas 
seals for OEM as well as aftermarket applications. At least one manu-
facturer of advanced sealing devices has the capability to repair and 
test dry gas seals made by others.5 Investigate the extent to which 
they can meet all of your reliability requirements; then consider using 
their dry gas seals.

40	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
What We Have Learned
Sealing technology merits a close review. Insist on references and 
check with other users on their experiences. Let all comparisons be 
fair and unbiased. Understand how seals function and accept only 
established facts. Discount anecdotal references and mere sales talk.
When using oil seals, ask where the excess oil will end up. Under-
stand oil consumption requirements. Understand cost. Understand if 
startup conditions might allow entrained vapors to condense and 
ruin the seal.
When using dry gas seals, thoroughly understand gas purity 
requirements. Only pure gas can be used. Factor-in the cost of servic-
ing auxiliary support equipment. Understand where the motive gas 
will go and what its operating costs are.
Regardless of seal type and style selected, the design of seal sup-
port systems should be under the compressor vendor’s jurisdiction 
and the compressor manufacturer’s warranty coverage. Resist the 
temptation to involve and deal separately with different suppliers.
However, seals and seal systems must be serviceable by your 
own workforces. It would not be prudent to depend entirely on the 
support of manufacturers and outside vendors.

CHAPTER 5
Bearings, Stability, 
and Vibration 
Guidance
O
ver the years, compressor manufacturers have furnished dif-
ferent types of hydrodynamic bearings, ranging from plain 
sleeve bearings and pressure dam sleeve bearings to very 
precisely machined tilting shoe (tilting pad) bearings. Compressor 
shaft systems are supported by these bearings and some of these 
bearing styles incorporate fixed geometries (Fig. 5.1). Many incorpo-
rate grooves or dams so as to achieve the desired support stiffness or 
damping characteristics. An analogy comes to mind with tuned shock 
absorbers in automobiles. These provide damping to vehicle motions 
that cannot be suppressed by spring supports alone. In compressors, 
one wants successive vibratory excursions to decline rather than 
increase and amplify. In stable systems there will be a logarithmic 
decrement, whereas a vibration increment (an amplification) would 
be noted in unstable systems.
Mechanical Design
Although plain sleeve bearings are often quite satisfactory, they have, 
collectively, been somewhat susceptible to subsynchronous oil whirl 
and also high-frequency oil whip—all problems creating rotor insta-
bility. Whirling is orbiting of the rotor center in the bearing. The orbit-
ing frequency is generally 0.42 to 0.47 times the running speed. Axially 
grooved bearings reduce instability risk, but require more oil flow to 
feed all grooves. They also have slightly reduced load-carrying capacity 
compared to full sleeve bearings. However, axially grooved bearings 
normally run cooler than plain bearings. 
Lobe bearings with symmetrical and asymmetrical bore patterns 
represent an improvement over axially grooved cylindrical bore 
bearings. Their noncircular bores allow the oil film to form a wedge. 

42	
C h a p t e r  F i v e
They were precursors to the present-generation tilting pad bearings. 
Tilting pads, also called tilting shoe bearings, have largely overcome 
the whirl and whip problems and are favored due to their ability to 
not only support, but also overcome small amounts of line-bore inac-
curacies at the bearing housing locations of compressor casings. Tilt-
ing pad bearings are available in different geometries, with different 
numbers of pads, pad pivot locations, pad curvature, and different 
axial-width-to-bore-diameter ratios. Which one to use can only be 
determined by a rotor dynamics study.
While it would be technically desirable to have the pivot point of 
the bearing pads off-center and with the leading edge portion some-
what larger than the trailing edge portion to enhance stability, the 
resulting bearing would be unidirectional. However, centered pivots 
are found to predominate in tilting pad bearings since the bearing is 
now suitable for shaft rotation in either direction. Regardless of 
overall geometry, most hydrodynamic bearings with steel backing 
have babbitt lining of about 0.8 mm (0.032 in) thickness, and clear-
ances of 1.5 to 2.0 × 10-3 in/in (mm/mm) of journal diameter. They 
utilize oil supply pressures in the relatively low range of 25 to 35 psi. 
Shaft rotation and bearing geometry cause higher pressures to be 
self-generated within the bearing. An oil film varying in thickness 
from 0.0001 to 0.001 in prevents metal-to-metal contact. Since shear 
action on the oil produces heat, the lubricant must be cooled. Circulat-
ing oil systems are best suited to accomplish the necessary cooling 
and filtering.

Destabilizing Forces and Aerodynamic Cross Coupling
Centrifugal compressors are custom-designed for particular gas prop-
erties and conditions. They are then shop-tested to verify proper 
mechanical operation. If, as an example, the gas molecular weight 
later changes at the process plant, there may occur performance 
changes in the compressor and the machine may exhibit fractional 
frequency vibrations of unacceptable magnitude.
Compressor performance is very much influenced by bearing 
design and gas loads acting on impellers. The bearing span (length 
of rotor) and shaft diameters may have been originally bought for 
operating conditions (MW, RPM) which were only slightly different 
from the conditions for which similar machines had been built 
before. Also, the original rotor was proof-tested in the machine 
before it was released by the equipment manufacturer.
Suppose a new compressor rotor was installed during an inspec-
tion and repair downtime (IRD) and would now operate under con-
siderably different load and speed conditions. Assume also that the 
rotor could not be proof-tested in its casing because running on air 
would have resulted in excessive discharge temperatures and run-
ning on the process gas would be costly and time consuming.
Basically, then, the user would deal with the first compressor 
combining this particular bearing span, shaft diameter, gas load, and 
RPM and, running into a problem is always a possibility when you 
break new ground. So, when a problem first surfaces, reliability-
focused users lose no time in identifying the root cause. The user can 
establish if a rotor vibrates at a frequency equal to its first natural 
frequency (critical speed) whenever a certain combination of speed, 
MW, and gas loading causes destabilizing forces in excess of the 
damping which normally inhibits vibrations in rotating machinery. 
In many machines, these destabilizing forces are called aerody-
namic cross-coupling.
These are simply the gas impulses which leave at the impeller 
vane exit edge. A simplified formula (Eq. 5.1) describes these forces as:
	
Aero C-C = [(K) (HP) (MW) (dexit)]/[(RPM) (dinlet) (D) (W)]	
(5.1)
where	 K = constant	
dexit = gas density, leaving
	
D = shaft diameter	
dinlet = gas density, entering
	
W = impeller exit width	
RPM = speed of rotor
	
HP = gas horsepower	
HW = molecular weight
Looking at this expression, we can see how there are many vari-
ables that tend to influence the machine’s behavior. If the impeller 
exit width were to increase because operations have, say, flushed-off 
some polymer deposits, the factor Aero C-C is reduced and the

C h a p t e r  F i v e
machine vibration decreases. Next time when flushing is attempted, 
operations will be less successful because dexit may have increased for 
some reason.
Fractional Frequency Activity in Bearings
Unlike once-per-revolution or twice-per-revolution frequency vibra-
tions, fractional frequency vibrations are highly unpredictable and 
can get out of control very rapidly. That’s why it is prudent to put 
certain machines on automatic trip (shutdown) whenever a predeter-
mined value is reached. Perhaps this predetermined value should 
equal 50 percent of the bearing clearance, or should be governed by 
industry experience. One rule of thumb allows the vibration ampli-
tude of the largest fractional frequency (or “subharmonic”) to reach 
15 percent of the amplitude at RPM frequency. If the amplitude climbs 
above 15 percent, the user’s reliability professionals would recom-
mend shutdown and repair.
Fractional frequencies and mysterious high frequencies are occa-
sionally found in high-pressure compressors. Complex aerodynam-
ics are often involved and anti-swirl vanes or destabilizing cascades 
(labyrinths) must be installed (Fig. 5.2). The intent is to dampen 
(meaning to obtain an amplitude decrement), and not to amplify 
(or increase) the vibration excursions. This is indicated in Fig. 5.3. 
A top industry consultant once estimated that centrifugal com-
pressors must be shut down in 3 to 10 seconds when the whirl orbit 
reaches 30 percent of the bearing clearance. Note that bearing clear-
ance calculations are given under the head “Bearing Clearances.” 
Suppose the bearing clearance is 0.008 in. Assume, for the sake of 
illustration, that the vibration amplitude reaches 3.2 mil (0.0032 in).

45
At 3.2 mil, the whirl orbit would be 3.2/8.0 = 40 percent of the clearance—
close to the 50 percent limit and certainly cause for concern.
As compressor users we must try to visualize rotor bow at mid-
span. That is why many multiimpeller (multistage) compressors 
have a stainless steel labyrinth between the last wheel in a given com-
pression stage (or compression section). At, say, 6000 RPM, a severely 
bowed shaft can contact a portion of the labyrinth 100 times in a sin-
gle second. The shaft will heat up instantaneously, bow some more, 
and cause a serious wreck. To avoid this heat-up eventuality, recall 
that we advocated use of frangible labyrinth materials in an earlier 
chapter.
Examining What Can Be Done about Instability
Process operations personnel may have ways of juggling their 
variables (MW, dinlet, dexit, HP, and RPM) in efforts to reduce the 
magic number Aero C-C. Competent machinery engineers may be

able to introduce a little more damping (sponginess, vibration 
soak-up capability) by changing the lube oil pressure and viscosity 
(a temperature-dependent property), and also by changing the bear-
ing preloading or orientation of the shaft relative to the bearing sur-
face. This latter fix will require lifting the back end of the compressor 
by shimming, or thermally increasing the outboard support legs as 
much as 40 to 50 mil (1–1.25 mm).
But that’s of only limited value at times and can gain a little bit of 
maneuvering space at best. A permanent solution will require chang-
ing to a bearing type which provides greater damping. Reliability-
focused users often purchase a set of these bearings—“just in case.”
Thrust and Radial Tilt Pad Bearings
A typical thrust bearing is shown in Fig. 5.4. The entire assembly 
consists of a number of tilting pads (six, in this illustration), which 
are allowed to articulate and operate in conjunction with a thrust-
equalizing disc secured to the shaft. The thrust disc shown on the 
right of Fig. 5.4 is surrounded by a two-piece labyrinth seal.
Thrust bearings are used to locate the rotor axially and at the same 
time absorb any axial rotor thrust. Thrust bearing configurations 
include flat land, tapered land, and tilting pad models. Their respec-
tive load-carrying capacities range from 50 psi to 250 psi. However, 
the most popular configurations comprise self-equalizing, leading-
edge spray-lubricated tilting pads with permissible specific loads 
ranging from 200 to 400 psi (Kingsbury-type LEG). Bearing material 
options include tin/lead base babbitt and various copper-bearing 
alloys (bronzes) to suit specific applications. In each case, the com-
pressor designer desires not to exceed 50 percent of the bearing manu-
facturer’s allowable load rating. Bearing designs also call for suitable 
conservatism whenever the possibility exists of additional thrust 
being transmitted from or through multiple casings.

47
Thrust bearings must have the correct axial clearance—typically 
0.008 to 0.010 in—to perform properly. During maintenance-related 
shutdowns and before further dismantling, the exact rotor float from 
its mid position toward the active and nonactive sides of the thrust 
bearing should be checked. When the bearing is removed, the pads 
should be examined for wear and other surface damage. Also, the 
rotor free-float should again be checked before the compressor is fully 
assembled at site. Free-float shows the feasible axial impeller move-
ment within the casing before the thrust bearing is being installed. 
Final readings are taken and recorded after installation of the thrust 
pads. In essence, the correct positioning of the rotor in its casing and 
observing thrust collar locations relative to the active and inactive 
thrust bearing pads require considerable care and patience. Axial 
position probes (proximity probes) are used for on-stream monitor-
ing of rotor location.
Many modern centrifugal compressors also use tilt-pad bearings 
of the type shown in Fig. 5.5 in the radial shaft support location. The 
number of pads ranges from three to seven and, although the pads 
are equidistant from each other, they can be oriented for load-on-pad 
or load-between-pad.
A rotor response plot (Fig. 5.6) simulates rotor unbalance and 
determines rotor speeds where vibration amplitudes would be exces-
sive. Again, the number of pads and load orientation (load-on-pad 
vs. load-between-pads) influences the damping qualities and deter-
mines the range of speeds where a particular compressor rotor will be 
susceptible to high vibration.
The compressor manufacturer makes a thorough analysis of the 
rotor behavior under slight unbalanced conditions. The results of 
such an analysis are shown in Fig. 5.6, an example case for a six-stage 
rotor. Here, the resulting vibration would be at its most severe,

mately 8400 RPM of this rotor, the vibration amplitude would be no 
more than 4 µm—much less than the allowable 15 µm.
Before we leave the subject it is worth mentioning that transient 
local flow instabilities are another, fortunately quite rare, deviation 
from smooth operation. Sometimes, a flawed control valve upstream of 
the compressor inlet is at fault. At other times, a surge or stalled flow 
condition may occur unexpectedly. Again, these conditions are rare, 
but we need to know about them. Never discourage expert analysis.

Bearing Clearances
Bearing clearances will affect heat generation and support stiffness. 
A typical diametral clearance can be calculated from the expression
C = (0.001 × shaft diameter) + 0.002 in
As an example, a compressor with a journal diameter of 8.000 in 
would use bearings with bore diameters of nominally (0.001 × 8) + 
0.002 = 0.010 in. One might use a tolerance of +/−10 percent and allow 
bearing bores ranging from 0.009 to 0.011 in.
Centrifugal compressors are generally designed to operate above 
their first critical speeds. Critical speed is somewhat analogous to the 
resonant frequency at which a rotor assembly would vibrate if struck 
by a hammer. Critical speed analyses and rotor response plots must 
be provided by the vendor and must be reviewed by the buyer’s 
engineer. If the owner-purchaser and vendor-manufacturer disagree 
on calculated results, a third-party analysis may be required to resolve 
discrepancies and reconcile the different results.
Although both bearing header and bearing metal temperatures are 
typically monitored, bearing metal temperatures are the more impor-
tant of the two. Alarm settings of 110°C to 120°C are generally used for 
bearing temperatures while high header temperature (bulk oil) alarms 
are often set at 80°C. Centrifugal compressors should be shut down 
when the actual bearing temperature reaches 135°C and the cause or 
reason for this high bearing temperature should be examined.
Tin-based babbitt is preferred over lead babbitt due to its superior 
corrosion resistance and better bonding with steel backing. The tin-
based material is, however, not as “forgiving” of dirt inclusions in the 
lubricating oil as is the lead-based version of the alloy.
Vibration and Acceptable Limits
Because vibration amplitude is a measure of the severity of the trou-
ble in a machine, an obvious question will be: How much vibration is 
too much? To answer this question, it is important to bear in mind 
that the objective is to use vibration checks to detect trouble in its 
early stages and schedule an appropriate correction procedure. The 
real goal is to get a fair warning of impending trouble, not to deter-
mine how much vibration a machine can tolerate before it will fail.
There are no absolute values or vibration limit which, if exceeded, 
will result in immediate machinery failure. The events surrounding 
the development of a mechanical failure are too complex to set any 
reliable limits. On the other hand, you must have some general indica-
tion of machinery condition that can be evaluated on the basis of 
vibration amplitude. This is possible through the use of general guide-
lines that have been developed by experience over many years.

Figure 5.7  Compressor shaft vibration (1 mil = 0.001 in of radial motion), 
direct-measured by an eddy current probe mounted in the bearing cap (Ref. 6).
The guidelines shown in Fig. 5.7 generally refer to centrifugal com-
pressors that have been purchased and installed in accordance with 
best practices. Obviously, operation in the field labeled “good” should 
give you comfort, but what about operating in the “marginal” or 
“unsafe” ranges? Here’s our recommendation. As you move past the 
mid-range of “marginal,” consider procurement and implementation 
of permanently mounted monitoring instruments. Depending on com-
pressor size, speed, internal geometry, and general accessibility, this 
instrumentation might include radial and axial casing vibration trans-
ducers in addition to the existing shaft-observing eddy current probes. 
Also, it would be advantageous for the instrumentation package to 
include thrust bearing temperature thermocouples and shaft position-
monitoring probes. The various probes or monitoring instruments 

B e a r i n g s ,  S t a b i l i t y,  a n d  V i b r a t i o n  G u i d a n c e 	
51
would be connected to logic circuitry or trip logic modules configured 
and wired to trip the machine whenever two out of three maximum 
allowable values would be exceeded. The maximum allowable value 
of a temperature thermocouple sensing true babbitt temperature might 
be 260°F (126.7°C); the maximum allowable shaft vibration amplitude 
from one or more of the various eddy current transducers would be as 
shown by the “unsafe” line in our diagram.
The limits shown in the figure are based on the long-term expe-
rience of a practicing engineer.6 Note that these vibration limits refer 
to probe installations close to and supported by the bearing hous-
ing. Assume that the main vibration levels above 20,000 RPM reflect 
the experience of high-speed air compressors (up to 50,000 RPM).  
Readings must be taken on machined surfaces, with runout less than 
0.5 mil (0.0005 in) up to 12,000 RPM, and less than 0.25 mil above 
12,000 RPM.
Judgment must be used, especially when experiencing frequencies 
in multiples of operating RPM on machines with standard bearing 
loads. Such machines cannot operate at the indicated limits for fre-
quencies higher than 1 × RPM. In such cases, enter onto the graph the 
predominant frequency of vibration instead of the operating speed.
Anyway, when analyzing machinery vibration to pinpoint a par-
ticular problem, it is essential to know the vibration frequency. Know-
ing the frequency helps identify the problem and points to the part 
that has changed. Forces causing vibration are generated by the rotat-
ing motion of machine parts. Because these forces change in direction 
and amplitude according to the rotational speeds of the various parts, 
it follows that many vibration problems will have frequencies that are 
closely related to rotational speeds. We can often spot a defective part 
by noting its vibration frequency and associating that frequency with 
the rotational speed of the various machine parts. Alternatively, we 
can attempt to determine acceptable vibration levels as a function of 
speed harmonics.
The speed harmonics table, Table 5.1, relates to vibration mea-
sured on bearing housings. A velocity transducer would feed the 
resulting signal into a data collector/analyzer with filtering capability. 
Such a data acquisition package would be capable of displaying 
equipment vibration velocity (inches or millimeters per second) at 
running frequency and its respective multiples.
The harmonics table for various rotating machines shows two 
rows labeled “A” and “B.” Experience shows “A” values to represent 
maximum filtered velocities on machines clearly considered smooth 
running. Similarly, “B” values represent the highest levels of short-
term operability reported by a fair sampling of the machines listed. It 
should be noted, however, that not every machine may necessarily 
still be safe to operate at these levels. Similarly, machines with sturdy, 
overdesigned components may survive longer than expected.

A reasonable approximation for maximum levels of operability 
with unfiltered vibration velocities could be calculated by taking the 
square root of the sum of the squares. For blowers, this maximum 
unfiltered vibration velocity limit would be 0.74 in/s.
What We Have Learned
Rotordynamic studies (unbalance response analyses) are needed to 
define rotor speeds that must be avoided.
Compressor bearing configurations and bore clearances affect 
rotor stability. Vibration amplitude and frequency monitoring can 
track rotor behavior and are important.
High-frequency vibrations in high-pressure compressors may be 
aerodynamic in origin. Anti-swirl vanes or de-swirling labyrinths 
may need to be installed in such machines.
Bearing temperature tracking can give early warning of discrep-
ancies that must be addressed. Whenever sensors embedded in the 
babbitt reach 135°C, a precautionary shutdown should be effected. 
Experience-based vibration guidelines may not be totally accu-
rate but they are infinitely more precise than mere guesses.

CHAPTER 6
Lube and Seal Oil 
Systems
C
ompressor auxiliaries are responsible for more downtime events 
than actual compressor components. To be considered reliable, 
they deserve close scrutiny and must often be upgraded from 
the traditional vendor’s standard configuration. Compliance with 
API-614 is helpful, but it must be kept in mind that the various API 
standards are intended to explain minimum requirements. Minimum 
requirements can differ from best available technology.
As of 2011, only a relatively small percentage of the many thousands 
of centrifugal compressors operating in modern industry were equipped 
with magnetically suspended or gas-lubricated bearings. The over-
whelming majority of compressors use oil lubrication for the bearings 
that either support the compressor shaft (radial bearings) or limit shaft 
axial movement (thrust bearings). This chapter deals with these systems.
Similar comments pertain to compressor seals. Seals are needed 
to prevent migration from the pressurized compressor interior vol-
ume (the compression space) toward the bearings. These seals come 
in a variety of configurations (see Chapter 4) and the majority requires 
oil as a coolant and lubricant. The auxiliary systems that feed oil to 
bearings and seals are often combined, in which case they are aptly 
called lube and seal oil systems. Separate systems are more common 
and will be required if seal oil is contaminated by entrained “sour” 
gases, such as H2S. A plain lube oil system is represented in the sim-
plified schematic of Fig. 6.1. A few of the most common instruments 
are also shown on this illustration.
Reservoirs must include valve and space provisions for tempo-
rarily or permanently connecting oil purifiers to the low-point drain. 
In addition to removing water contamination, modern oil purifiers 
will also remove undesirable gases from the seal oil. Additional com-
ments are found later in this chapter; don’t overlook them.
If both drivers are electric motors, different feeder connections 
are recommended by API-614. It should be of interest that Note 1  
(in Fig. 6.1) also alerts purchasers to locate the suction piping away 
from reservoir low points where dirt might easily accumulate.

Figure 6.1  Simplified, but typical, compressor lube oil system. Multiunit systems require provisions to separate (to valve-off) one system from

A reliability-focused user will take a very active part in the selec-
tion and design process for these compressor support systems. An 
infinite number of component combinations are possible and user 
preferences are to be discussed and agreed upon at the selection stage. 
Guidance can be found in the various API specification documents; 
however, the instrument nomenclature chosen by vendors and man-
ufacturers often differs. Table 6.1 is one of many hundreds of feasible 
listings of instruments typically found on lube and seal oil systems. 
The owner-purchaser’s engineer must understand the purpose and 
functionality of each of these elements.
Layout Guidance
All systems must be properly laid out and supply piping sized for 
maximum velocities not in excess of 7 fps (~2 m/s). Stainless steel is 
used for all piping, both upstream and downstream of filters. Stain-
less steel is also needed for vessels, housings, tanks, and their respec-
tive tops. Only certain valves and a few instruments are (possibly) 
exempt from this requirement. With high reliability the first and fore-
most goal, all supervisory and control instrumentation elements are 
likely to include stainless steels.
Cost-cutting has made inroads here, although some “savings” are 
false economy that will often cost dearly. To avoid unavailability, here 
are some of the key areas that should not be overlooked:
• Access to major hardware and instruments should be easy.
• Filter housings must be vented to a safe location. After replac-
ing a filter, air must be vented so as to make this standby filter 
housing ready for operation. Venting back to the oil reservoir 
is allowed.

• With the possible exception of valves, all oil-wetted parts of 
the lube oil system (but not the pumps) should be made of 
stainless steel. The top lid of the oil reservoir must be made of 
stainless steel also, because moisture condensation can accu-
mulate on this cover.

the “B” filter-cooler set must incorporate provisions to lift its 
plug off the valve seal before the plug can be rotated in the 
desired direction.
• If the top lid is made of plain steel, the resulting rust forma-
tion (on the inside) will take its toll as reduced equipment 
reliability or require increased preventive maintenance. It 
should be noted that a nitrogen “blanket” to fill the space 
between liquid oil and top lid will not be a fully effective 
method of preventing rust on plain steel top lids.
• The top lid is slightly inclined to allow rainwater and spilled 
oil to drain. Pipe connections and access ports (“manways”) 
are flanged with top openings raised at least 1 in above the 
reservoir top and no tapped holes are allowed anywhere on 
the reservoir.
• All fill openings must be provided with removable strainers.
• Integral internal relief valves are permitted on rotary positive 
displacement pumps. However, only external relief valves 
are permitted on pressure vessels.
A small-to-mid sized lube skid is shown in Fig. 6.2. The photo 
depicts two vertically arranged filters and a manual lever-operated 
switching valve located near the base and between the two vertical 
filter housings. Only one heat exchanger was apparently selected by 
the customer; it can be seen on the right side of the skid. Oil returned 
from the lubricant user—perhaps a small compressor—reenters the 
stainless steel reservoir near the upper left corner of the photo. 
Although no lube oil pumps are shown in Fig. 6.2, the skid designer 
will undoubtedly have sized at least two, and sometimes three lube 
pumps for oil flows that include unusual upset conditions. When 
both pumps are motor driven, different feeders or a DC supply source 
are generally specified. The direct-current source must supply power 
for as long as it takes an operator to secure the main compressor and 
manipulate all associated valves.
Again, note how the principal components are readily accessible. 
Suction pipes must be arranged to provide positive suction head for 
the various feed pumps, with the suction line sloped down from the 
reservoir to horizontal pumps, or with at least two (and sometimes 
three) vertical-style feed pumps actually immersed in the oil residing 
in the reservoir. Our recommendation to install horizontal piping 

L u b e  a n d  S e a l  O i l  S y s t e m s

with a slope is sometimes contested by pump manufacturers. How-
ever, sloping will allow gas to be vented back to the reservoir; it 
should be considered mandatory.
To rule out unexpected surprises and the occasional finger point-
ing, the compressor manufacturer must be directly responsible for 
the design, although the manufacturer often asks third parties to fab-
ricate and test the entire skid.
Examine What Often Goes Wrong
Reliability-focused users specify lube and seal oil systems that comply 
with the applicable standards of the American Petroleum Institute 
(API-614). These standards constitute a detailed and enhanced bill of 
materials as well as a description of redundancies required to impart 
years of uninterrupted uptime to such systems. Appropriate instru-
mentation must be provided and an experienced compressor opera-
tor should be involved in selecting these instruments and determining 
their operator-friendly, optimum, mounting locations. Ease of mainte-
nance and accessibility compete with the desire to keep things compact 
and a measure of judgment must be exercised by purchaser and vendor.

the right foreground; a single cooler (heat exchanger) is horizontally arranged 
on the right (Ref. 1).

C h a p t e r  S i x
With few exceptions, systems that do not comply with API Stan-
dards will require more frequent maintenance. Regardless of stan-
dards applied, the purchaser would be wise to review a number of 
pertinent details. Here are the ones most often overlooked:
Main versus Standby Pump
Pumps must be centrifugal or rotary-positive displacement. Driving 
off the main driver or compressor shaft is rarely acceptable, because 
pump failure would mandate equipment shutdown. If two or three 
pumps are used, at least one is usually driven by a small steam tur-
bine. Pumps must have carbon steel casings, and cast iron casings are 
allowed only inside the reservoir. Exposed cast iron pumps would be 
prone to crack when involved, directly or indirectly, in a fire event.
A decision must be made as to which pump is normally on standby 
(although the turbine-driven pump is usually selected for standby 
duty). Still, someone must define how quickly the turbine comes up to 
speed (and reestablishes the required oil pressure), and what the elec-
trical classification should be for motor drivers. Suitable electronic 
governors should be selected for the small steam turbine. If the steam 
turbine driven pump is in standby mode, it might have to be kept 
warm and “slow-rolled.” It should have a return line with restriction 
orifice back to suction, and dewatering of piping and steam turbine 
casing must be accomplished by using the right steam trap types and 
models.
Standby equipment deserves more attention than it usually seems 
to receive. Pumps and their respective driver shafts must be relatively 
easy to align.2 Couplings should be specified with a service factor of 
2 or more, and these should be relatively maintenance free. Drivers 
should be specified with load factors or service ratings that corre-
spond with best practices.
The start switch or actuator component for the auxiliary pump 
must have a manual reset provision. A steam condensate exhaust 
hood will be needed for steam exhaust lines to atmosphere. Without 
it, operators risk being showered with scalding water whenever the 
auxiliary steam turbine-driven pump set kicks in.
Slow-Roll Precautions
On some steam turbine models, slow rolling below a speed of approx-
imately 150 rpm will not allow an oil film to be established between 
journal and bearing bore. Also, consideration must be given to an 
emergency source of oil to be fed to the turbocompressor train in an 
occasional power failure event. If there is even a remote possibility of 
neither oil pump being available, an overhead rundown tank should 
be provided to gravity-feed the turbomachinery bearings. A pressur-
ized overhead tank is shown in Fig. 6.3, but nonpressurized (atmo-
spheric pressure) tanks are quite often used as well. An atmospheric 

L u b e  a n d  S e a l  O i l  S y s t e m s 	
61
breather valve or vent must be used with nonpressurized models and 
the user-purchaser must pay attention to issues of airborne dirt and 
birds trying to build nests in or near such vents. A drilled check valve 
is then used between the lube supply header and atmospheric pres-
sure overhead rundown tank. Regardless of the type of rundown 
tank selected, elevations must be such that the static head is less than 
the equipment lube-oil trip pressure. An API standard (API-614) 
gives guidance on these and several other important matters dealing 
with lubrication, shaft sealing, and control oil systems for special 
purpose applications.
The anticipated time it typically takes for the machine to coast 
to a stop is 8 minutes, with 15 minutes a more conservative limit. 
This rundown tank should be vented and the vent must be oriented 
and configured to prevent entry of birds and debris. Ask if the 
overhead rundown tank must be heated or insulated for operation 
in cold weather. Are suitable autostart facilities provided? Double-
check to verify proper dewatering facilities provided at all points 
of the steam piping and at the turbine casing. Ask also if these facil-
ities are reliable or were simply purchased from the lowest bidder 
without further thought given to maintenance requirements and 
energy efficiency.
In installations with two electric motor-driven pumps, the 
power should come from different feeders or substations. Tempo-
rary power dips during pump switch-over are bridged by using a 
hydraulic accumulator in the lube supply line. The bladder of the

accumulator is usually filled with nitrogen and the configurations 
and functionalities of such accumulators are well known. Yet, 
although relatively widely used, typical bladder-type accumulators 
(Fig. 6.4, left image) risk premature failure from the rubbing action 
of the neoprene or Buna rubber bladder against the accumulator 
walls. This failure risk is further amplified when dirt particles are 
carried in the oil.4 Diaphragm-style accumulators (Fig. 6.4, right 
image) were used in reliability-focused user companies after 1975 to 
facilitate condition monitoring and to avoid such rubbing-induced 
failures. Note (right image) that a standard diaphragm-type accumu-
lator is fitted with a vertical indicator rod and a transparent dome at 
the top.
 Reliability-focused plants modify the standard diaphragm accu-
mulator of Fig. 6.5 by removing seal ring and screw plug and tightly 
fitting a tall transparent high-strength plastic dome at the top of the 
accumulator. A tapped hole is machined into the center of the shut-off 
button and a long “gauge rod” threaded into this tapped hole. The 
gauge rod extends through the opening created by removing the 
screw plug. The tip of the gauge rod is seen by the operator making 
their surveillance rounds. The integrity of the flexible diaphragm and 
its properly proportioned nitrogen versus oil-fill volumes are visu-
ally ascertained as is shown in Fig. 6.6, which shows a large field

installation. Wire mesh screens are installed to guard against a care-
less overhead hook or a maintenance tool accidentally hitting the 
polycarbonate sight glass dome.
If bladder-type accumulators are deemed acceptable, be sure they 
have a 10-second or greater capacity and are equipped with fill valves 
and isolation valves that permit monitoring of bladder condition. 
Bladderless accumulators will require high-level alarm, low-level 
alarm, and low-level cut-off provisions.
System Reservoirs
An armored sight glass must be supplied for the reservoir. Because 
the reservoir is to be made of stainless steel, its interior is not to be 
coated or painted.
Minimum standard practice calls for oil reservoirs to be sized for 
at least 2.6 minutes of maximum flow. In other words, a lube oil sys-
tem with pumps supplying 100 gpm would be sized for an operating 
volume of 260 gallons (1000 L) or more. A more conservative high-
reliability practice defines the system operating range as 2.6 times 
gpm, to which is added either 40 gallons or 1 week’s oil leakage rate, 
whichever is more. Other rules-of-thumb are noteworthy; one of these 
calls for a free oil surface in the reservoir of at least 0.25 ft × 2/gpm 
so as to promote air disengagement from the oil.

Figure 6.6  Diaphragm accumulators installed at a best-of-class facility.
Oil reservoirs are typically rectangular and are provided with a 
sloped bottom, sometimes called a “false bottom.” The volume below 
the sloped false bottom is filled with a heat transfer fluid for pre-
startup heating or for maintaining a controlled temperature. The vol-
ume above the false bottom is, of course, the actual working volume 
of the oil reservoir. Convention calls for a reservoir vent to be one 
pipe size larger than the sum of the areas of all seal drains.
 In installations where steam is available, a thermal fluid with 
high temperature capability and low volatility should fill the space 
below the sloped bottom. If no steam is available, electric heaters 
sized not to exceed 15 W/square in (the “watt density”) can be used 

L u b e  a n d  S e a l  O i l  S y s t e m s 	
65
to heat the thermal fluid. Electric temperature control switches should 
be provided if electric heat is selected. A high-capacity vent is needed 
to accommodate thermal expansion of the heat transfer fluid below 
the sloped bottom of an oil reservoir. A side-mounted gauge glass or 
dipstick is required to verify or monitor the height of thermal fluid 
under the false reservoir bottom. If a steam coil is used for heating, 
there should be suitable steam traps.
Heating Requirements
In some climates, heating will be needed only at startup or in low-
temperature ambient conditions. Heaters are generally sized to effect 
heating from lowest average ambient to a minimum allowable oil 
temperature (73°F/20°C, for the very typical ISO VG 32 lubricant) in 
4 hours. It is possible to preheat the lubricant by simply admitting 
steam into the water upstream of coolers. However, temperature 
indicators will have to be installed and a responsible individual will 
have to be put in charge of this emergency heating operation. For 
cold temperature regions or in situations where large ambient tem-
perature swings are common, the reservoir may require external 
insulation. Such insulation then has the associated benefit of reduc-
ing condensation of water vapors in the reservoir.
The return oil from the turbocompressor may be at sufficiently 
elevated temperature to flow freely without further addition of heat. 
Valves are required at the low points of the reservoir working volume 
and at the lowest possible point of the heating space below the sloped 
reservoir bottom. The drain valve at the low point of the working 
volume serves also as a connection for an on-stream lube oil purifier. 
Such purifiers are normally sized to handle the entire system work-
ing volume in 24 hours. They must be provided with a piping leg that 
prevents reservoir emptying. Some will also require a condensate 
removal line.
All reservoirs must be fitted with internal baffles or stilling tubes 
that allow for contaminants to settle out. Oil returning from the tur-
bocompressor bearings or bypassed from the pressurizing pumps is 
not allowed to fall into the reservoir since that would risk static elec-
tricity build-up. The vents from filter housings and other points in 
the installation should lead back into the reservoir.
Filters and Coolers
Suitable instrumentation is needed on filters and coolers. The layout 
must permit the system to operate while maintenance personnel are 
safely performing routine service on nonoperating redundant ele-
ments. Except for the transfer valve (main switching valve) and the 
structural parts of the mounting skid, stainless steel is the required 
material of construction in reliability-focused plants. Block valves 

66	
C h a p t e r  S i x
and check valves are needed and the user-purchaser must devote 
time and effort to review the piping and instrumentation diagram 
(P&ID) for functional completeness.
Kickback valves that route excess oil back to the reservoir must be 
located upstream of the filters and coolers. They should be sized to 
pass the excess capacity of one pump plus the full capacity of the 
standby pump. Dual valves may be needed to obtain proper valve 
coefficients in certain seal systems.
It is usually considered a good move to involve one’s operators 
before specifying and purchasing filters and coolers for an existing 
facility. Blotter paper-style filter cartridges are not acceptable. Allow 
the operators to ask if they are satisfied with the instrumentation 
package shown on the schematics, or on a mockup of the system. 
Obtaining buy-in from staff at this stage is of great future value.
Normally, coolers are bought in compliance with TEMA Class C 
shell requirements and have removable bundles. Experienced users 
will not permit tubes with less than 5/8 in OD 18 BWG, but will allow 
double pipe fin-tube exchangers for small systems. It is usually best 
to check prior user experience and ask questions. Unlike pumps, 
coolers are pressure vessels that must be designed and manufactured 
in accordance with applicable codes. Water should be on the tube 
side, oil on the shell side. The oil pressure must exceed cooling water 
pressure to prevent, or at least reduce, leakage of water into the oil 
system in the event of tube failure. The oil side design pressure 
should be equal to, or greater than, the pump relief valve setting with 
PD pumps and shutoff pressure with centrifugal pumps. Material 
selection guidelines are given in Table 6.2.
Each cooler must have an oil fill line, a drain, and a high point 
vent—all suitably valved and generously sloped. Cooling water flow 
enters at the bottom and exits at the top. Drain piping is typically 
sized for a maximum velocity of 1 fps (~0.3 m/s).
High-pressure gas piping should be seal welded and all piping 
should be configured to allow for its thermal expansion. Remember 
that the piping may have to be removed for cleaning prior to com-
pressor commissioning. There need to be flanges and special loca-
tions (such as near bearings and seals) for the insertion of temporary 
strainers. Flexible expansion joints are not allowed in the piping 
because of the danger of fatigue failure. Flexible joints and hoses are 
also disallowed because they tend to be the first stationary elements 
to fail in a fire.
To facilitate oil drainage back to reservoirs in typical gravity 
systems, each compressor bearing housing typically requires a 1-in 
minimum vent. Gear boxes and couplings are generally equipped 
with 2-in vents. Coupling guards may require special air exchange 
provisions to prevent trapped air from overheating the coupling 
components.

Centrifugal Compressor Lube/Seal Reservoir  
Explosion Hazards
The static electric charge generation mechanism was investigated by 
prominent users in the mid 1970s. Static charge buildup in filters was 
determined to be the cause; it was confirmed by careful measure-
ments. Systems that had experienced explosions were equipped with 
pressure-controlled recycle lines downstream of the seal oil (or lube/
seal oil) filters. In obvious contrast, systems with recycle lines origi-
nating upstream of filters and with line lengths that allowed relax-
ation of charges remained trouble free.
Safe designs allow 30 or more seconds for the oil to travel from 
filter outlet to reservoir inlet. Because undesirable agitation of the oil 
surface must be avoided, the return line should enter the reservoir 
below the oil level. Pressurized return lines should not be vented 
inside the reservoir.
Seal oil system gas reference lines should be provided with a 
drilled check valve to prevent disruption of overhead accumulator 
level control during compressor surge. There is also a need for provi-
sions that allow introduction of a simulated gas signal (sometimes 
called a “false buffer gas”) during startup when running a compres-
sor on air, or with a suction pressure below design. These provisions 
may require control systems that can fully accommodate prevailing 
running-in conditions.
What We Have Learned
Lube and seal oil systems must be carefully and conservatively 
designed. A review of their adequacy must start at the proposal stage. 
The owner-purchaser must thoroughly understand each design ele-
ment. Each pipe or control line should be traced back to its origin; its 
design intent must be understood, and all of the owner-purchaser’s 
questions must be answered by the vendor-manufacturer.
Reliability-focused owner-purchasers go beyond the minimum 
requirements of API-614 in their efforts to impart the ultimate in main-
tainability and ease of surveillance to these very important systems.
Special diaphragm-style accumulators are one of many examples 
where reliability-focused thinking is translated into component selec-
tion. They represent best-available technology and have been used by 
best-of-class companies for many decades.

CHAPTER 7
Impellers and 
Rotors
Construction, Inspection, and Repair of Impellers
A closed impeller with backward-leaning vanes is shown in Fig. 7.1. 
Such impellers offer a wide operating range and the backward lean 
offers a combination of process stability and reasonable efficiency. 
Two versions are widely available, a two-dimensional (2-D) and a 
three-dimensional (3-D) configuration. Figure 7.2 shows a 3-D impel-
ler that was contour milled from one single piece of metal. This type 
of contour milling is ranked among the favored fabrication processes 
and is not to be confused with techniques whereby individual blades 
are being welded to an impeller hub.1
Two-Dimensional versus Three-Dimensional Impeller Blading
The backward lean in a 2-D version has the same curvature through-
out the blade width. In the case of a single shaft compressor with 
multiple stages, the volume at the inlet to the next stage is being 
reduced and this lowers the stage efficiency. A compromise comes to 
mind: One could reduce the impeller diameter to gain efficiency. 
However, reducing the diameter would reduce head produced and 
more stages would be needed. Now the shaft would have to be made 
longer, which would affect the dynamic stability or susceptibility to 
undesirable vibration behavior of the compressor rotor.
All of these factors must be given consideration for good com-
pressor design practices. The same machine will not incorporate sig-
nificantly different impeller diameters on the same rotor. In any 
event, three-dimensional (3-D) impellers with contoured (“twisted”) 
blades seem to be better adapted to varying flow conditions. For 
technical reasons, the axial width of a 3-D stage exceeds that of the 
equivalent 2-D impeller. Since the axial dimension is wider compared 
to the 2-D version, the number of impellers (“wheels”) that can be 
installed is restricted due to stability considerations. Moreover,

Industries.)

speeds are generally governed by the mechanical tip speed limitations 
of the impeller material selected by the designer.
The operating range of compressor impellers can also be improved 
by using a measure of backward lean for the radial portion. Impeller 
performance and surge point location are related; the surge point 
determines the useful operating range and head capability. Comparing

three-dimensional impellers with backward-lean radial inlet impel-
lers is of interest. The more highly contoured three-dimensional geom-
etries often feature improved operating and flow range.
Careful Design Needed to Avoid Failures
There are, in certain instances, compelling reasons for using three-
dimensional impellers. Vendors have two manufacturing options: 
that of producing individual blades and to then weld these on an 
impeller hub, and that of contour machining the entire wheel (the 
terms “wheel” and impeller are used interchangeably).
In either case, the designer must realize the importance of indus-
try’s decade-old practice of not allowing blade passing frequencies 
(BPFs) to coincide with impeller’s natural frequencies. For risk reduc-
tion, it will be necessary to validate the vendor’s analytical “model” 
against actual field experience. Aerodynamic excitation could origi-
nate in many ways, including in the form of gas returning from down-
stream impeller(s) to the first-stage impeller inlet, via the balance line. 
Consideration should also be given to nonuniform and nonrepeatable 
impeller blade and blade weld geometry and their potential effect on 
component strength, stiffness, and frequency response.
The inspection and repair decisions for centrifugal compressors 
may encompass a number of areas. A competent inspector is essential 
and it should not be assumed that the vendor-manufacturer has a 
large inspection workforce in place. Inspection coverage must be pre-
arranged by the user-purchaser so as to reduce unforeseen startup 
delays and avoidable failures. Always recall that the compressor 
owner or its representative must reach a clear understanding with the 
manufacturer or the compressor rebuilding facility as to the exact 
deliverables. The achievement of predefined fits and dimensions 
must be part of this understanding.
While the compressor owner-purchaser has no intention of acting 
as the compressor designer, many items covered in this chapter are 
on impellers and rotors. Understanding a few of these items should 
enable the owner (or owner’s representative) to ask relevant ques-
tions. The manufacturer’s answers will uncover deviations or manu-
facturing compromises that need to be corrected in the interest of 
failure risk reduction. An owner’s engineer is designated to be the 
focal point individual whose ultimate task is to ensure that compres-
sors are reliable. While this owner’s engineer will probably have 
many roles to fulfill, space limitations mandate that we select a role 
that is largely representative of the many other roles and responsi-
bilities assigned to reliability professionals. So, we picked an inspec-
tion overview and deliberately chose to explain impeller-related 
repair and inspection steps.
Compressor impellers are typically custom-fabricated compo-
nents. Although standard components (bearings, shaft seals, etc) may 

74	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
not merit the same level of attention or inspection coverage, the 
owner-purchaser may apply similar thinking to verify the adequacy 
of those and other components. For failure risk reduction an owner’s 
inspector (or a third-party agency inspector reporting to the owner’s 
machinery engineer) must inspect the following: 
• Disassembly (unstacking) of the rotors.
• Reconditioning and certification of the shaft.
• In case of upgrading, reconditioning and certification are 
needed for individual, previously used impellers. Observa-
tion of fabrication steps and certification are needed for new 
impellers.
• Finally, restacking and certification of modified rotors is to be 
observed and compared with all applicable procedures.
Specific guidelines and areas of concern are included in this seg-
ment of our text and should be discussed with the compressor manu-
facturer or rebuild shop. Then, agreement should be reached on 
deliverables and written into the contract. Here are some highlights:
Rotor Manufacturing for Centrifugal Compressors
Unstacking the Rotor  An existing compressor rotor such as the one 
shown in Fig. 7.3 may have to be unstacked (impellers removed) for 
repair or upgrading. Prior experience shows that careless unstacking 
procedures cause extreme deformation of impeller bores. Careless pro-
cedures (or no procedures) have occasionally been observed even at 
legacy-brand manufacturers’ facilities. That said, a reliability-focused 
user wishes to avoid repetition of this problem and will insist on 
having the work performed properly.
	
1.	 On old-style centrifugal rotor assemblies, impellers are some-
times secured to the shaft with keys and keyways. However, 
looseness of either the impeller or the keys is not allowed 
because it would lead to fretting and unbalance problems.
Figure 7.3  A six-stage rotor with closed impellers. The thrust disc is on the 
right side in this photo; the balance piston is shown on the left.

2.	 In Fig. 7.4 the impeller bore region at diameter “A” is called 
the impeller heel; the bore region at “B” is called the impeller 
toe. It should be noted that the interference at the toe of many 
impellers is deliberately made only one-half (50%) of the 
interference at the heel. Some vendors use these obviously 
different fits so as to allow a measure of thermal expansion in 
the direction of the toe while keeping the heel from moving.
	
3.	 As we visualize a rotor coming up to speed and going through 
a resonant speed (sometimes called a rotor critical speed), the 
shaft will go through a flexing (“bowed”) condition. Allow-
ing for a very small amount of sliding movement in the axial 
direction under the impeller toe will make it less likely for the 
impeller to clamp itself to the shaft while in a momentary 
bowed condition.
	
	   There is also a purposely undercut (relieved) region, diam-
eters “J” and “C”. Each of these two diameters is related to 
the keyway dimension in the impeller bore. Also, two key-
ways are used in some rotor designs. 
	
4.	 On most modern centrifugal rotors the impeller-to-shaft assem-
bly is made without keys. Instead, there is a uniform impeller-
to-shaft shrink fit (0.00075-0.0015 in/in of shaft diameter). 
Some compressor manufacturers use a uniform (identical) 
diameter for both toe and heel region. The user-purchaser 
may inquire about the manufacturer’s experience and ask for 
clarifying answers.

5.	 In any event, the unstacking procedure will require impeller 
heating or, in extreme cases, a combination process of heating 
the impeller and cooling the shaft.
	
6.	 The shrink fits are generally calculated to be released when 
the wheel is heated to 600°F (316°C) maximum. To exceed 
this figure on materials other than AISI 410 or 4140 could 
result in metallurgical changes in the impeller. (Note that the 
impeller is sometimes called “wheel.” For the more typically 
used impellers [made of AISI 4140], one allows a maximum 
temperature of 1000°F [538°C]. Color-coded crayons which 
melt at a particular temperature—a popular brand is called 
“Tempilsticks”—should be used to ensure this temperature is 
not exceeded.)
	
7.	 The rotor is vertically suspended over a sand pit. For unstack-
ing, the lowermost impeller is located at a height of perhaps 
2 m (6–7 ft) off the sand surface.
	
8.	 The entire diameter of an impeller must be uniformly heated 
using “rosebud” tips—two or more torches are used at the 
same time.
	
9.	 The important thing to remember when removing impellers 
is that the heat must be applied quickly to the rim section 
first. Only after the rim has been heated should heat be 
applied to the hub section, starting at the outside. A special 
note deserves to be highlighted: Never apply heat toward the 
bore while the remainder of the impeller is cool.
	 10.	 To disassemble rotors, the parts should be carefully marked 
with a felt-tipped pen or similar indelible marker in the 
sequence they are taken apart. This will make it possible to 
later reposition parts in the proper position. A sketch of 
rotor component position should be made using the thrust 
collar or shoulder to adjacent impeller hub exit area. 
Measure and record the distances between all impellers. 
Each impeller should be stenciled. From the thrust end, the first 
impeller should be stenciled T-1, the second one T-2, and so 
on. If working from the coupling end, stencil the first wheel 
C-1, the second wheel C-2, and so on. This requirement 
would not be significant in a rerate job where only some of 
the impellers are being reused. However, there are situa-
tions where, after unstacking, the equipment owner might 
experience an emergency and would ask for the rotor to 
be quickly restacked and shipped back to the owner’s facil-
ity. Following the prescribed marking procedure would 
be of extreme importance if such a need should develop 
unexpectedly.

	 11.	 As mentioned above, a rotor should preferably be suspended 
vertically above a sandbox to soften the impact of the impel-
ler as it falls from the shaft. Alternatively, the rotors may be 
suspended over wooden scaffolding or similar rigging as 
long as the drop distance from impeller edge to the wooden 
structure does not exceed 2 in (~50 mm).
It may be necessary to tap the heated impeller with a lead ham-
mer in order to get it moving. The weight of the impeller should 
cause it to move when it is hot enough. Always insist on using a lead 
hammer; steel hammers are unacceptable for this task. Involving two 
workers with two hammers applying reasonable blows from diago-
nally opposite positions makes much sense.
Impeller Inspection and Overspeed Testing  Impeller inspection and over-
speed testing are required for new impellers and also for previously 
used impellers slated for use as reconfigured or upgraded impellers 
in new rotors.
	
1.	 Impeller inspection is divided into two segments, before 
overspeed and after overspeed tests. Before overspeed test-
ing, the owner’s inspector must be present when the com-
pressor manufacturer (or entity responsible for equipment 
rebuilding) conducts the following operations:
• Ultrasonic testing of forgings prior to machining
• Liquid penetrant testing or, alternatively,
• Magnetic particle examination
• Measurement and recording of critical dimensions
	
	   If ultrasonic testing has been or will be performed at the 
foundry, the inspector must review applicable certificates 
and submit these to the ultimate equipment owner.
	
2. Liquid penetrant testing or, alternatively, magnetic particle 
examination is to be performed after each weld operation 
and after each heat cycle.
	
3.	 Impellers must be individually balanced before overspeed 
testing. Grinding to achieve proper balance should in no case 
reduce remaining material thickness below the drawing-
specified dimension. If necessary, the vendor-manufacturer 
shall machine an entire quadrant or similar portion of the 
impeller.
	
4.	 Before overspeed testing, the designated inspector must visu-
ally examine the cover, disc, and vanes for surface flaws. This 
should be done at the same time as preliminary liquid pene-
trant or magnetic particle examinations are underway.

78	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
Fabrication Inspection  A number of guidelines cover the fabrication 
and inspection procedures, and workmanship standards for welded 
impellers must be as discussed below:
	
1.	 Materials
	 (a)	 Impeller materials such as 4140 used in most (but not all) 
compressor rotors fall within the requirements for Grade 
B of ASTM A-294, an Ni-Cr-Mo alloy steel. This steel can, 
theoretically, be heat treated to moderately high yield 
strengths of 80,000 to 100,000 psi, and ultimate strengths 
of 110,000 to 130,000 psi. Rotors in H2S-containing pro-
cess gas service have yield strength and hardness limita-
tions of 90,000 psi and RC-22, respectively.
	
	   Hardness limits imposed by H2S service are an indirect 
limitation on yield strength because of the correlation that 
exists between tensile strength and hardness (see ASTM 
A-370). Heat treatments must be controlled so that the 
above hardness limits are not exceeded on any impellers 
used in H2S-containing services. However, the hardness 
limit may be exceeded in the weld region of impellers 
whose critical dimensions have been fully established.
	 (b)	 The compressor manufacturer or competent rebuild facil-
ity may start with annealed material and heat treat the 
completed wheel to obtain the desired physical proper-
ties. Alternatively, these entities may begin with quenched 
and tempered material and postweld treat the assembly.
	 (c)	 Determine if the impeller material requires that the parts 
be preheated and kept heated during welding. Establish 
if the weldment must receive postweld heat treatment. 
Failure to keep some materials hot for welding will cause 
under-bead cracking.
	
2.	 Wheel Assembly: Compressor manufacturers, of course, have 
many wheel configurations, sizes, and wheel designs. The 
design controls the sequence of assembly, the weld joint con-
figuration, welding process, heat treatment used, etc. The 
owner’s inspector should: 
	 (a)	 Determine the manufacturer’s methods in building a 
wheel, including their workmanship standards. If work-
manship is not considered acceptable, this must be resolved 
through discussion and agreement with the manufacturer 
and the owner’s machinery engineer.
	 (b) Resolution should start at a pre-inspection meeting. At 
this meeting, compressor manufacturer and compressor 
owner-purchaser must reach an understanding of deliv-
erables. It must be kept in mind that if standards need to 

I m p e l l e r s  a n d  R o t o r s 	
79
be improved, the requests must be made in such a man-
ner that extra charges are avoided. For example, there has 
been difficulty convincing a few manufacturers that they 
should be concerned about undercutting in welds on 
impellers. Many competent user-purchasers believe the 
amount of undercutting permitted should not exceed the 
following values:
• Maximum depth 0.030 in, up to 1 in long
• Maximum depth 0.010 in, up to 6 in long
• Individual linear indications shall not exceed 3/16-in
	 (c)	 Competent user-purchasers also have positions on other 
weld flaws, including pinholes, cracks, and other defects. 
Among these are:
• Concavity beyond the drawing-specified crown must 
be ground down.
• Fillets beyond a specified leg length must be main-
tained. This is an indirect control on maximum throat 
thickness.
• The weld bead must be fused at the root and toes. Root 
pore is not to exceed 1/32-in diameter.
• Occasionally, an excessive gap at the vane-disc or cover 
interface causes root cracking. If full penetration tee 
welds are not required at the wheel edge, the cross-
section of the weld on the machined edge of the wheel 
should be visually checked for root cracks and repaired, 
if any are found.
• The vendor-manufacturer should submit (and commit 
to using) a procedure that reflects its long-term satis-
factory experience.
• Pinholes (piping) should not exceed a maximum 
diameter of 1/16 in, and not more than one is permit-
ted in each 4 in of weld length. To the extent that devi-
ations are allowed for certain materials, these must be 
discussed with the owner’s machinery engineer.
• Transverse cracks should not be permitted. The owner’s 
engineer may allow other cracks, but these must clearly 
comply with the manufacturer’s long-term experience 
and must be evident from a written procedure used by 
the vendor-manufacturer.
• Notches, slag pockets, and arc craters: On unfinished 
impellers, remove by grinding unless the remaining 
weld metal is under specified thickness in which case the 
area should be filled with clean weld metal. On finished 

80	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
impellers, invoke the compressor manufacturer’s experi-
ence-based procedure documents.
• Insist on all spatter being removed and do not permit 
lack of fusion in the transverse direction.
• Require that the compressor manufacturer provide 
maps showing indications requiring repair on impel-
lers that are to be reused in uprate situations.
• The compressor manufacturer should have experience-
based procedures that govern base metal indications 
and their removal on new and/or used impellers. Be 
sure that these are followed on your manufacturing or 
remanufacturing jobs.
	 (d)	 Unless approved by the owner’s machinery engineer, the 
inspector cannot incur extra charges to obtain improved 
workmanship. To the extent necessary, the owner’s inspec-
tor must verify these indications and request the manufac-
turer’s formal advice regarding cost of required repairs.
	
3.	 Impeller Inspection: The owner’s inspector should spot-
check the weld shop periodically to see that the compressor 
manufacturer’s own procedures are being followed. These 
checks should be performed at agreed-upon times, if neces-
sary with a manufacturer’s escort in proprietary areas of the 
plant. This type of checking or verification should cover:
	 (a)	 Joint preparation. A good many designs call for the vanes 
to be double fillet welded to the disc and cover, although 
butt welds and a slot weld have been used. At points of 
high stress, as on the eye end of vane and possibly at the 
outer end, complete root penetration may be specified. 
This requires some type of back-grinding, gouging, etc, 
after one side of the fillet is made.
	 (b)	 Measure the amount of preheat and inter-pass temperature 
being maintained. Low temperature can cause under-bead 
cracking.1
	 (c)	 Check whether correct electrodes are being used and if 
they are being properly cared for. Wheel welds may be 
made in one or two passes. AWS Class E 7018 electrodes 
are commonly used for the root pass of two pass welds or 
for one pass deposits. This electrode has a low hydrogen 
coating and good resistance to cracking.
	 (d)	 For the second and final layer of weld metal, an E 6027 elec-
trode has typically been used. This electrode produces flat 
or slightly concave fillets with fine ripples which minimize 
the amount of cleaning and finishing required. The E 7018 

I m p e l l e r s  a n d  R o t o r s 	
81
electrode deposit is not quite as good in this respect. 
Some undercut may be found along the edges where it is 
difficult to get the electrode in the right position, as in the 
gas passages. More spatter can also be expected from the 
7018 electrode. Note that E 7018 electrodes must be kept 
in an oven at 225°F (108°C) until actual use.
	 (e)	 Both electrodes have lower strength than the parent 
metal. It is estimated that the weld deposit of an E 7018 
wire, through alloy pickup from the base metal and final 
heat treatment, might end up with a tensile of 75,000 psi. 
The tensile of the outer layer of weld metal E 6027 might 
be between 60,000 and 65,000 psi upon completion. This 
approach has proven satisfactory for compressor wheels. 
However, some experts believe the strength of the weld 
deposit should match or slightly exceed the strength of 
the base metal.
	 (f) Whenever the finished impeller has a Rockwell C hard-
ness limitation (typically RC 24 as the upper limit) due to 
H2S service, the base metal in each wheel should be 
checked with a portable hardness-monitoring instrument.
	 (g)	 Accurate determination of weld metal and HAZ (heat-
affected zone) hardness on a finished impeller is most 
difficult without destroying an impeller. The predefined 
and specified hardness requirement for the weld can be 
satisfied by having the compressor or impeller manu-
facturer make a mock-up joint, using the welding proce-
dure employing the maximum thickness of impeller 
material to be used, and duplicating the same joint, elec-
trodes, heat treatment, etc, each impeller receives. The 
mock-up should be cut so the cross-section of the weld 
is exposed and a Rockwell C hardness traverse can be 
taken across the face. The traverse should be made par-
allel to and not more than 2 mm below the surface. If 
high hardness is verified, the mock-up must be heat 
treated, resectioned, and rechecked, etc, until satisfac-
tory hardness is obtained. The welding procedure, heat 
treatment, etc, which produced acceptable hardness levels 
must be used on the wheels.
	 (h)	 This qualification test need not be repeated so long as 
none of the essential variables are changed. The impeller 
manufacturer should keep the results of this test on file, 
for at least 5 years. In other words, if it can be established 
that the qualification procedure has been followed previ-
ously for impellers of identical material, none of the above 
may have to be invoked.

82	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
	
4.	 Weld Examination
	 (a) Radiography
	 (1) Radiography can also be used for checking weld 
quality in welded impellers, although its use is not 
widespread due to the type of welding methods used 
and because of wheel configuration. If radiography 
is used to inspect welded impellers, the acceptance 
level for weld flaws must be determined at the 
preinspection meeting.
	 	
  Moreover, it is necessary to agree how often radi-
ography will be taken and what follow-up is required 
when defective welding is found. The inspector 
should then obtain the owner’s machinery engineer’s 
approval of the applicable manufacturer’s standards 
and procedures. In turn, this engineer may refer the 
matter to others, but it’s his or her ultimate responsi-
bility to seek definition and resolution.
	 (2)	 The quality of the radiographs in terms of density, sen-
sitivity, etc, should correspond to ASME Section VIII, 
Paragraph UW-51 standards, bearing in mind that 
weld configuration and impeller construction may 
prevent strict compliance with code requirements.
	 (b) Liquid penetrant
	 (1)	 This technique only discloses flaws open to the sur-
face. The fluorescent penetrants are more sensitive 
than visible dyes because of the viewing conditions.
	 (2)	 If the vendor opts to use liquid penetrant, his stan-
dards should always be reviewed by the inspector. 
Cracks and crack-like indications are unacceptable. 
Scattered porosity can be accepted provided there 
are less than four rounded pores in a line, separated 
by more than 1/16 in edge-to-edge, axially oriented 
with respect to the weld. Gross surface porosity den-
sity should not exceed that indicated by the medium 
porosity chart for ½ in thick welds in Appendix IV of 
Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code. More 
relaxed standards must be approved by the owner-
purchaser’s machinery engineer. The weld surface 
flaw standards in the AWS Structural Welding Code 
are considered to be too lenient.
	 (c)	 Magnetic particle
	 (1)	 This method is preferred for linear flaws on or within 
1/8 in of the surface, in materials that can be mag-
netized. To be effective, the magnetic field must be 
oriented so it crosses the flaw at an angle of roughly 45°. 

I m p e l l e r s  a n d  R o t o r s 	
83
Fortunately, most flaws in new impellers are longitu-
dinally oriented with respect to the weld. Fatigue 
cracks in an impeller that has been in service might 
have random orientation, so that the magnetic field 
should be applied in two directions, roughly 90° apart. 
It is possible to detect an open gap under a vane where 
the fillets do not have full penetration. This is espe-
cially so if the throat of the weld is undersize or the 
gap is excessively wide. If these indications are strong 
(heavy), the inspector must satisfy himself that the 
weld is acceptable. In such a case, it might be neces-
sary to weld a mock-up with a known flaw of the 
type suspected. A crack-like flaw will give a sharper-
edged indication. The magnetizing force should meet 
or exceed ASME Code, Section VIII requirements.
	 (2)	 All cracks and crack-like flaws are to be addressed as 
stated earlier in this segment of our text. Any porosity 
indications should be judged the same as those dis-
closed by liquid penetrant examination.
	 (d)	 Ultrasonic examination: If the vendor opts to use this 
inspection method, the owner-purchaser should require 
the following:
	 (1)	 The shear wave of the weld to determine the degree 
of weld penetration and detect flaws per ASME 
Code, Section VIII. A straight beam can be used on 
fillet welds. UT examination is not used routinely on 
welded impellers. It has been used for special appli-
cations such as checking for under-bead cracks and 
on-plug welds, for lack of root penetration.
	 	
  Examination of the fillet welds joining the vane to 
either the disc or cover can present a practical prob-
lem. These problems become more acute when the 
fillets, as is usually the case, do not have complete 
penetration. The difficulties are:
	  
• Flaw orientation. Tight subsurface throat cracks 
and lack of penetration at the root of the weld 
may not be found by ultrasonic testing (UT).
	  
• Small clearances in the gas passages. Usually 
they do not permit use of the crystals inside the 
passages. This requires any examination be done 
through the disc or cover.
	  
• Varying material thicknesses. The discs and covers 
usually taper in thickness from the hub toward the 
periphery. Crystal movement must be adjusted to 
compensate for this.

84	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
	  
• UT response from the open root of the tee joint 
makes interpretation difficult and confusing. With 
this type of joint only the area underneath the toe 
of fillets in the discs and covers can be confidently 
tested. More response is obtained if the weld has 
complete penetration through the vane.
	 (2)	 Ordinarily, the impeller manufacturer’s standards for 
flaw acceptance and instrument calibration can be 
used. As a guide, whenever difficulty is being experi-
enced with under-bead cracking, all flaws with an 
indicated depth and more than 1/8 in long are cause 
for rejection.
	
3. Repairs
	 (a)	 If the examinations show defective welds, etc, the impel-
ler must be repaired, reexamined as before, and centri-
fuged again. This step is then followed by any final NDT 
required.
	 (b)	 If the material air hardens in response to the heat input 
from welding and will require preheat, it requires main-
taining a defined interpass temperature and PWHT 
(Post-Weld Heat Treatment). These requirements must be 
met, regardless of impeller age. The inspector should not 
accept a repair on an impeller that was not made in accor-
dance with the welding procedure used when the impel-
ler was originally built, unless it is specifically approved 
by the owner’s machinery engineer.
	 (c)	 Dimensional checking: Dimensional checking is required 
for impeller hub bore, outside diameter, eye diameter, 
vane width, and disc and cover thickness. Experience 
shows that special care is needed not to allow unaccept-
able tapering, or out-of-roundness of impeller bores on 
impellers that have been removed from a preexisting 
rotor. Dimensions must be within drawing tolerances or 
in accordance with documented engineering instructions 
superseding these drawings. They should be recorded for 
comparison with measurement made after overspeed 
testing. The owner-purchaser’s designated inspector 
should witness these checks.
	 (d)	 Overspeed testing: Impellers of proven design should be 
overspeed-tested at 115% of maximum continuous, new 
impeller designs should be overspeed-tested at 120% of 
maximum continuous. All tests should be witnessed. In 
uprate situations the overspeed test speeds may differ 
from those originally used in the impellers and rotors ini-
tially sold to the owner-purchaser. With few exceptions a 

I m p e l l e r s  a n d  R o t o r s 	
85
“scope of supply” or similar specification document should 
be developed and referenced.
	
	   After the overspeed test, each impeller should be visu-
ally examined again and any required NDT examinations 
should be witnessed. The owner’s inspector should note 
that the points of highest stress are in the cover close to 
the eye of the impeller near where the vanes terminate. 
These are points where indications of possible failure will 
first show.
	
• API 617 assumes the compressor manufacturer has 
established its own acceptance standards for flaw indi-
cations. For casting and forging flaws, these standards 
can be compared with those given in the ASME Code, 
Section VIII, Division I.
	
• If the manufacturer’s standards are more lenient than 
those listed in the ASME documents, the inspector 
should request instructions from the owner’s machin-
ery engineer, unless the owner-purchaser’s scope or 
specification document has already covered the devia-
tion.
	
• If repairs are necessary, the repaired area must be reex-
amined by the specified NDT method and the wheel 
overspeed tested again.
	
• Impeller diameters, including hub bore should be 
rechecked. If the growth exceeds the impeller manu-
facturer’s tolerances, the wheel should be rejected by 
the inspector and the manufacturer’s proposed action 
referred to the owner’s machinery engineer for 
approval.
	
4. Rotor Inspection
	 (a)	 The major components of the rotor assembly are the 
shaft, spacers, impellers, balancing drum, and thrust 
collar.
	 (b)	 If, in uprate situations, the shafts that have originally run 
in the owner’s compressor are being reused, ultrasonic 
testing of the shaft will not be required.
	 (c)	 The critical shaft dimensions are the diameters over which 
shrink fits will be made, where keys will be placed, and at 
the journals. These dimensions must be carefully checked 
and recorded. The finish of the journals and probe sur-
faces can be examined again when run-out of the rotor is 
checked.
	 (d)	 Any potential proposal to correct an undersized journal or 
shaft area by chrome plating cannot be approved by the 

86	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
inspector; this must be done by the owner’s machinery 
engineer.
	 (e)	 The surface preparation and other parameters may have 
to be closely investigated by knowledgeable third par-
ties. The authors’ basic position has been to not accept 
plating as a repair for increasing shaft diameters. How-
ever, there have been cases where approval was given to 
add 10 to 15 mil (0.010–0.015 in) to the shaft diameter.
	 (f)	 When the impellers are assembled on the shaft with a 
shrink fit, the inspector should verify that the manufactur-
er’s personnel control the bore diameters of the hubs and 
the temperature to which the impellers are being heated.
	 (g)	 Before witnessing the final balance, the owner’s inspec-
tor should review shop assembly records and review the 
interference fits of wheels on shafts against the manufac-
turer’s standards. Normal interference is 0.001 in/in of 
shaft diameter.
	 (h)	 High-speed dynamic balancing of the compressor rotors 
is required and the final balance check must be witnessed. 
Balancing procedures and balance tolerances are described 
in API 617. The version (or late edition/revision) that 
applied at the time of original purchase is usually accepted 
by the owner-purchaser.
	 (i)	 It should be noted, however, that the maximum balanc-
ing and proof speeds may have changed in uprate situa-
tions. The owner’s inspector should always verify that, 
when an incremental balancing procedure is required by 
the compressor manufacturer’s engineering personnel, 
the required procedure is actually followed by the manu-
facturer’s shop personnel.
	
5. Run-Out Checks of the Assembled Rotor
	 (a)	 These run-out checks should be witnessed. The run-out 
check made after rotor assembly is particularly impor-
tant because the measurements will indicate if the rotor 
has been assembled properly or has bowed due to stresses 
introduced during assembly or by mishandling.
	 (b)	 For a run-out check, the rotor can be supported on level 
knife edges or checking can be done while still in the bal-
ancing machine. A dial indicator is set up on the diameter 
to be checked and the rotor is rotated. The total reading is 
the run-out.
	 (c) Run-out checks should be made on the bearing journal 
surface, the radial vibration probe surface, impeller eyes, 
and thrust collar surfaces.

I m p e l l e r s  a n d  R o t o r s 	
87
	 (d)	 These readings are to be compared to those on shop 
assembly drawings. Any measurements outside of toler-
ance must be questioned, as there may be bowing of the 
shaft or assembly errors. The owner’s inspector must be 
certain that the mechanical run-out at the radial vibration 
probe surfaces does not exceed 0.2 mil (0.0002 in). The 
inspector must also verify that the shaft surface finish at 
radial probe locations is equal to the finish on the jour-
nals. Axial probe-sensing surfaces must be perpendicular 
to the shaft axis within 0.2 mil (0.0002 in).
	 (e)	 Next, the electrical run-out in the eddy current probe 
areas of the shaft must be checked and recorded. If the 
total (mechanical plus electrical) run-out exceeds 0.25 mil 
on new shafts, or 0.5 mil (0.0005 in) on reused shafts. The 
surface must be burnished or, if it will not clean up, be 
fitted with a sleeve. Final compliance must be verified by 
the owner’s inspector.
	 (f)	 At this stage in the manufacturing cycle, it must be ver-
ified that the residual magnetism in shafts and impel-
lers does not exceed 3 Gauss (3 G). Do not overlook this 
requirement!
	
6.	 Safety Issues: The inspection work described above involves 
close visual examinations, witnessing of tests, and, at times, 
the use of gages to ascertain the accuracy or correctness of the 
manufacturer’s quality control effort.
	 (a)	 The minimum eye protection required while engaged in 
this type of work is safety spectacles with side shields. 
Hearing protection may be required in certain areas of 
the manufacturer’s plant. As a guide, if conversation is 
difficult due to noise level, use hearing protection. 
Beware of damage to fingers while inspecting impel-
lers. Do not examine equipment while suspended from 
a crane.
	 (b)	 The inspector must not wear ties, dangling decorations, 
loose fitting clothing, or loose long hair while working 
around rotating machinery.
What We Have Learned
You get what you inspect, not what you expect. Other than bearings 
and seals, impellers are the most likely process gas compressor 
parts to fail. The majority of these compressor impellers (“wheels”) 
are custom designed and custom fabricated. Welded construction is 
widely used.

88	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n
Impeller fabrication and testing require quality control inspection. 
While competent compressor manufacturers have quality control 
departments, it would be unrealistic to expect that their judgments 
always favor the user-purchaser. Moreover, “downsizing” and “right-
sizing” tends to disproportionately affect quality control and inspec-
tion departments.
The owner’s inspector need not be an expert in all the techniques 
used in the various manufacturing and testing practices, but needs to 
be an expert in asking the right questions. A competent vendor or man-
ufacturer will answer these questions without reluctance. That is 
because such a manufacturer will have nothing to hide and, by answer-
ing the owner-purchaser’s questions, will fulfill a much-needed tutor-
ing and mentoring role.

CHAPTER 8
Compressor 
Maintenance 
and Surveillance 
Highlights
A 
later chapter (Chapter 10) will make the point that mainte-
nance cost avoidance can be built into a compressor specifi-
cation. Maintenance cost avoidance is ascertained during 
“before-purchase machinery quality assessment,” or MQA. At all times, 
specifying, purchasing, installing, and operating reliable compressors 
makes more sense than buying compressors on faith, past reputation, 
or lowest bid price.
When purchasing new compressors the best available solution is 
specify, design, built, and install machines with low risk in mind. The 
need for frequent or specific types of maintenance can be “designed 
out;” the most desirable compressor is designed for uptime extension, 
low failure risk, and lowest possible life cycle cost. On equipment that 
is already in service one has to opt for the next-best available solution. 
This would mandate that every maintenance intervention is viewed 
as an opportunity to upgrade. If upgrading is feasible, it will also 
have to be cost-effective. Upgrading should then result in the system-
atic reliability improvement of previously weak links in the compo-
nent chain.
A prominent, but dated source1 cites 13% of all failures of tur-
bocompressors as being due to errors or omissions in condition 
monitoring and maintenance. With the advance in monitoring 
technology and modern operating and maintenance practices one 
would assume that this general number might not be as high today. 
What then are good monitoring and maintenance practices around 
turbocompressors?

90	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
Compressor condition monitoring has the following components:
	
1.	 Proper response to supervisory instrumentation such as alarms 
and trips.
	
2.	 Periodic observation and evaluation of operating parame-
ters such as the compressor physical condition and its per-
formance efficiency. This would include measuring and 
judging the rate of deterioration of mechanical and perfor-
mance conditions for input into maintenance plans. Vibra-
tion analysis and aerodynamic performance calculations 
come to mind. Daily compressor operator rounds should be 
structured following the principles of operator-driven reli-
ability, “ODR”.2
	
3.	 Evaluation of operating trends. This should include auxiliary 
systems, such as lubrication and seal oil consoles, compressor 
on-line washing facilities, and dry gas seal support systems.
	
4.	 Periodic testing of lubrication and seal oils. Six basic analyses 
are required: Appearance test, testing for dissolved water, 
flash point test, viscosity test, the determination of the total 
acid number (TAN), and the determination of the additive 
content.3
	
5.	 Periodic testing of emergency shutdown devices (ESD) and 
other fail-to-danger components, such as exercising the com-
pressor’s surge control valve loop and the trip and throttle 
(T&T) valve on steam turbine-driven compressor trains.
	
6.	 Data logging and automated record keeping such as the num-
ber of unplanned trips per train per year as a basic indication 
of compressor reliability.
	
7.	 Diagnosis of problems, appraising their severity and decid-
ing what action to take.
	
8.	 Remedial action and execution planning.
	
9.	 Corrective measures should preferably be applied on-stream 
to reduce the impact on compressor availability. On-line 
flushing (washing) would be a good example.
Generally, turbocompressors have maintenance inspections, 
overhauls and repairs (MIO&R), elsewhere called IRD, meaning 
inspection and repair downtime. These terms are used interchange-
ably with “turnarounds.” MIO&Rs or IRDs are scheduled in periodic 
intervals ranging from 2 to 10 years, depending on the type of service. 
Maintenance intervals in clean services in the hydrocarbon industries 
of 6 to 10 years are not uncommon. The extent of MIO&R efforts 
ranges from simple bearing inspections to opening the compressor 
and replacing the rotor with a spare rotor drawn from specialized 

C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e 	
91
spare parts storage. Used rotors are examined for rubs at labyrinth 
seal locations and for fissures and cracks around impeller eyes on 
radial compressors. Rotor blades and also stator blades of axial 
compressors require thorough examination and testing. In all cases 
nondestructive test (NDT) procedures are being applied.
As the scheduled compressor turnaround approaches, it is best 
practice to review the machine’s operating and maintenance history. 
Then, if there are any defects noted at inspection, it would be well to 
ask the following questions:
	
1.	 Are any of these defects repeat occurrences?
	
2.	 If so, can they be expected at this turnaround?
	
3.	 What steps can be taken to eliminate them?
	
4.	 What action should be taken at this time?
A thorough pre-turnaround review should be undertaken in 
order to plan the work required. It should consist of:
	
1.	 An assessment of the compressor’s mechanical condition
	
2.	 A performance check
	
3.	 A diligent review of the machine’s past history
Preventive and Predictive Maintenance Explained
Still, both the good and not-so-good compressors will have to be 
maintained, and the prevailing maintenance strategies can be either 
preventive or predictive. Preventive maintenance (PM) is time based 
whereas predictive maintenance (PdM) has as its goal compressor oper-
ation until detectable defects start to develop. Detection requires 
high-quality predictive monitoring methods and comes at a cost. 
Qualified personnel have to be employed and ongoing monitoring 
efforts have to be quite precise. Management expects PdM to deter-
mine when a failure will occur and then plan an outage accordingly.
It is fair to say that certain state-of-art predictive routines can be 
used to minimize the impact of a premature failure, or to understand 
when a machine drifts into off-design operation. But cost savings 
always come back to the knowledge ingredient. None of the various 
PdM judgments can be made without experience. Real depth of expe-
rience and wisdom will be needed when several seemingly minor 
deviations occur and converge.
Preventive maintenance encompasses periodic inspection and 
the implementation of remedial steps to avoid unanticipated break-
downs, production stoppages, or detrimental machine, component, 
and control functions. Predictive, and to some extent also preventive 

92	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
maintenance, is the rapid detection and treatment of equipment 
abnormalities before they cause defects or losses. This is evident from 
considering lube oil changes. This routine could be labeled preven-
tive if time-based, and predictive if done only when testing shows an 
abnormality in the properties of the lubricant. Without strong emphasis 
and an implemented preventive maintenance program, plant effec-
tiveness and reliable operations are greatly diminished.
In many process plants or organizations, the maintenance function 
does not receive proper attention. Perhaps because it was performed 
as a mindless routine or has, on occasion, disturbed well-running 
equipment, the perception is that maintenance does not add value to 
a product. This may lead management to conclude that the best main-
tenance is the least-cost maintenance. Armed with this false percep-
tion, traditional process and industrial plants have underemphasized 
preventive, corrective, and routine maintenance. Many have neglected 
to properly develop maintenance departments, elected not to pursue 
proper training of maintenance personnel, and to not optimize pre-
dictive maintenance. Many unforeseen compressor failures and safety 
hazards have resulted from not understanding what this is really all 
about.
Correctly executed, maintenance is not an insurance policy or a 
security blanket. It is a requirement for success. Without effective 
preventive maintenance, equipment is certain to fail during opera-
tion. To be effective, maintenance must be selective and has always 
had to be selective. Selective preventive maintenance (selective PM) 
results in damage avoidance, whereas effective PdM allows existing 
or developing damage to be detected in time to plan an orderly 
shutdown.
Compressor Maintenance in Best Practices Plants
Four levels of effective compressor maintenance exist. Although there 
is some overlap, the levels of maintenance are:1
	
1.	 Reactive, or breakdown maintenance. This type of maintenance 
includes the repair of equipment after it has failed, in other 
words, “run-to-failure.” It is unplanned, unsafe, undesirable, 
expensive, and, if the other types of maintenance are per-
formed, usually avoidable.
	
2.	 Selective preventive maintenance. Selective preventive mainte-
nance includes lubrication and proactive repair. On-stream 
lubrication of, say, the admission valve control linkage on 
certain steam turbines should be done on a regular schedule. 
In this instance, anything else is unacceptably risky and 
inappropriate.

C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e 	
93
	
3.	 Corrective maintenance. This includes adjusting or calibrating 
the equipment. Corrective maintenance improves either the 
quality or the performance of the equipment. The need for 
corrective maintenance results from preventive or predictive 
maintenance observations.
	
4.	 Predictive maintenance and proactive repair. Predictive mainte-
nance predicts potential problems by sensing operation of 
equipment. This type of maintenance monitors operations, 
diagnoses undesirable trends, and pinpoints potential prob-
lems. In its simplest form, an operator hearing a change in 
sound made by the equipment predicts a potential problem. 
This then leads to either corrective or routine maintenance. 
Proactive repair is an equipment repair based on a higher 
level of maintenance. This higher level determines that if the 
repair does not take place, a breakdown will occur.
Predictive maintenance instrumentation is available for both pos-
itive displacement and dynamic compressors. It exists in many forms 
and can be used continuously or intermittently. It is available for 
every conceivable type of machine and instrumentation schemes 
range from basic, manual, and elementary, to totally automatic and 
extremely sophisticated. Recommended instrumentation depends on 
compressor size and owner’s sparing philosophies. As an example, a 
facility may opt to install three 50 percent machines, two 100 percent 
machines or perhaps only one 100 percent machine in a given service. 
Moreover, unless the value of downtime avoidance is quantified it 
will not be possible to make firm recommendations as to the most 
advantageous level of monitoring instrumentation, shutdown strate-
gies, etc.
There are many competent manufacturers of manual monitoring 
equipment and manual monitoring is often used on small air com-
pressors. Advanced predictive maintenance on-stream systems are 
generally used with large process compressors to continuously mon-
itor vibration behavior. By gathering vibration data and comparing 
these data with normal operating conditions, both manual and con-
tinuous systems can predict and pinpoint the cause of a potential 
problem. The trouble is that detecting vibration is different from 
eliminating vibration.
An intelligent but highly selective preventive maintenance pro-
gram may lead to actions that prevent bearing distress and thus pre-
vent vibration from occurring in the first place. A selective preventive 
maintenance program may well be a more cost-effective program than 
any program or strategy that waits for defects to manifest themselves. 
This fact establishes that sweeping management edicts that disallow 
all manner of preventive maintenance on compressors do not harmonize 
with the principles of asset preservation and best practices.

94	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
Traditionally, industry has focused on breakdown maintenance, 
and unfortunately, many plants still do. However, in order to mini-
mize breakdown, maintenance programs should focus on levels 2 
through 4. 
Emergency Repairs Should Be Minimized
Plant systems must be maintained at their maximum level of perfor-
mance. To assist in achieving this goal, maintenance should include 
regular inspection, cleaning, adjustment, and repair of equipment 
and systems. Repair events must be viewed as opportunities to 
upgrade. In other words, the organization must know if upgrading of 
failed components and subsystems is feasible and cost-justified. On 
the other hand, performing unnecessary maintenance and repair 
should be avoided. Breakdowns occur because of improper equip-
ment operation or failure to perform basic preventive functions. 
Overhauling equipment periodically when it is not required is a 
costly luxury; upgrading where the economics are favorable is abso-
lutely necessary to stay in the forefront of profitability.
Regardless of whether or not PdM routines have determined a 
deficiency, repairs performed on an emergency basis are three times 
more costly in labor and parts than repairs conducted on a pre-
planned schedule. More difficult to calculate, but high nevertheless, 
are costs that include shutting down production or time and labor 
lost in such an event.
Bad as these consequences of poorly planned maintenance are, 
much worse is the negative impact from frequent breakdowns on 
overall performance, including the subtle effect on worker morale, 
product quality, and unit costs.
Effectiveness of Selective Preventive Maintenance
Selective preventive maintenance, when used correctly, has shown to 
produce considerable maintenance savings. Sweeping, broad-brush 
maintenance, including the routine dismantling and reassembling of 
compressors is wasteful. It has been estimated that one out of every 
three dollars spent on broad-brush, time-based preventive mainte-
nance is wasted. A major overhaul facility reported that “60 percent 
of the hydraulic pumps sent in for rebuild had nothing wrong with 
them.” This is a prime example of the disadvantage of performing 
maintenance to a schedule as opposed to the individual machine’s 
condition and needs.
However, when a selective preventive maintenance program is 
developed and managed correctly, it is the most effective type of 
maintenance plan available. The proof of success can be monitored 
and demonstrated in several ways:

C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e 	
95
• Improved plant availability
• Higher equipment reliability
• Better system performance or reduced operating and mainte-
nance costs
• Improved safety
A plant staff’s immediate maintenance concern is to respond to 
equipment and system functional failures as quickly and safely as 
possible. Every maintenance event must be viewed as an opportunity to 
upgrade so as to avoid repeat failure. This italicized sentence is the key to 
superior maintenance. Even good maintenance refers to relatively 
frequently scheduled work. Systematic upgrading will extend allow-
able intervals between shutdowns.
Know Your Existing Program
The starting point for a successful long-term selective maintenance 
program is to obtain feedback regarding effectiveness of the existing 
maintenance program from personnel directly involved in maintenance-
related tasks. Such information can provide answers to several key 
questions, and the answers will differ from machine to machine and 
plant to plant. Your in-plant data and existing repair records will pro-
vide most of the answers to the seven questions given below. A com-
petent and field-wise consulting engineer will provide the rest:
	
1.	 What is effective and what is not?
	
2.	 Which time-directed (periodic) tasks and conditional over-
hauls are conducted too frequently to be economical?
	
3.	 Which selective preventive maintenance tasks are justified?
	
4.	 What monitoring and diagnostic (predictive maintenance) 
techniques are successfully used in the plant?
	
5.	 What is the root cause of equipment failure?
	
6.	 Which equipment can run to failure without significantly 
affecting plant safety and reliability?
	
7.	 Does any component require so much care and attention that 
it merits modification or redesign to improve its intrinsic 
reliability?
It is just as important that changes not be considered in areas 
where existing procedures are working well, unless some compelling 
new information indicates a need for a change. In other words, it’s 
best to focus on known problem areas.
To ascertain focus, continuity of information, and proper activi-
ties relative to maintenance of plant systems, some facilities assign 
responsibility for well-delineated plant systems to a knowledgeable 

96	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
staff person. All maintenance-related information, including design 
and operational activities relating to such a system are funneled 
through this expert. He or she refines the maintenance procedures for 
the systems under his jurisdiction and reshapes preventive mainte-
nance into selective maintenance.
Maintenance Improvement
Problems associated with machine uptime and quality output affect 
several functional areas. Many people, from plant manager to engi-
neers and operators, make decisions and take actions that directly or 
indirectly affect machine performance. Production, engineering, pur-
chasing, and maintenance personnel as well as outside vendors and 
stores use their own internal systems, processes, policies, procedures, 
and practices to manage their sections of the business enterprise. 
These organizational systems interact with one another, depend on 
one another, and constrain one another in a variety of ways. Some 
constraints are appropriate; other constraints can have disastrous 
consequences on equipment reliability.
That said, program objectives need to be clearly defined. An 
effective maintenance program should meet the following objectives:
• Unplanned maintenance downtime does not occur.
• Equipment condition is known at all times.
• Where justified, preventive maintenance is performed regu-
larly and efficiently.
• Selective preventive maintenance needs are anticipated, 
delineated, and planned.
• The maintenance department performs specialized mainte-
nance tasks of the highest quality.
• All craftsmen are highly skilled and participate actively in 
decision-making process.
• Proper tooling and information are readily available and 
being used.
• Replacement parts requirements are fully anticipated and 
components are in stock.
• Maintenance and production personnel work as partners to 
maintain equipment.
Following these general guidelines for centrifugal and reciprocating 
compressors will give positive results.
What We Have Learned
The main lesson we learned decades ago is that one deviation alone 
might not be enough to bring on a compressor failure, but when several 

C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e 	
97
more deviations combine, the failure risk increases exponentially. 
So, while it might be possible to avoid more serious failures by imple-
menting an automatic compressor-unloading scheme, or adding 
bells and whistles that annunciate excessive temperatures and 
vibrations and seal deficiencies and the like, there will never be any 
substitute for the human brain supplying both logical root cause 
failure analysis and up-front failure prevention processes.
Achieving these up-front processes before calamities and finger-
pointing occur requires both training and accepting accountability. 
The operator, supervisor, or manager accepting a deviation from 
established practice should somehow be motivated (or should be 
compelled) to understand the potential ramifications of bypassing or 
not following established guidance and should document this under-
standing in writing. As the documentation requirements are then 
enforced, fewer deviations would be tolerated. Accept the initial 
incremental cost outlay needed to do things right. The apparent 
expenditure of time and money will ultimately bring rich rewards in 
safety, reliability, and increased profitability.
If you’re stuck with an existing compressor, view every maintenance 
event as an opportunity to ask if upgrading is feasible. Suppose the 
answer is yes and it can be shown to be cost-justified, do it. It’s your 
professional duty to the stakeholders. Stakeholders are not just inves-
tors, they’re husbands and fathers and families.

CHAPTER 9
Inspection and 
Repair Guidelines 
for Rotors
T
o be reliable, reproducible, and to give continuity to compressor 
repair, compressor owners must adhere to procedures. Conti-
nuity means passing on knowledge to successive generation 
of workers so as not to repeat errors.
In general, the manufacturer can provide the details that cover the 
routine maintenance inspection (during plant turnarounds), or the 
disassembly, stacking, and balancing of centrifugal compressor rotors 
if performance enhancing or throughput increasing (“uprating”) are 
involved.
A preexisting procedure serves as the usual framework of detailed 
repair instructions. Detailed instructions must be developed from 
standardized or preexisting procedures. These detailed instructions 
are then issued on an individual and as-required basis.
For the purpose of this text and to be concise, we are melding 
inspection and repair guidelines into one multifaceted document. 
From this starting-point document the owner-purchaser may then 
proceed in a variety of ways; the most prevalent are:
• Separate these multifaceted guidelines into stand-alone doc-
uments and use the stand-alones for follow-up. Stand-alones 
could be used in work performed onsite or offsite, or by the 
owner-purchaser’s permanent employees, or by another 
entity.
• Use these guidelines as a discussion basis with either the 
OEM or a non-OEM repair facility. Use these guidelines to 
reach agreement on deliverables.
Compressor owner-purchasers often deal with issues that must 
be assessed in conjunction with original procurement. At other times, 

100	
C h a p t e r  N i n e
owner-purchasers are involved in compressor uprates whereby a 
rotor is being reworked by the OEM or by a competent non-OEM to 
meet new performance parameters. Many of the data found below 
are relevant to both original procurement and future work situations; 
this text combines diverse data. Again, the owner-purchaser may opt 
to separate the data into one of many different scope and procedures 
documents.
Phase I (Initial Preparation)
Preliminary Work Lists and Tabulations of Deliverables for 
Work Performed during Planned Shutdowns
	
1.	 The compressor owner must have carefully prepared a com-
prehensive list of parts to be on hand and parts to be replaced 
during compressor shutdown.
	
2.	 The parts on hand must be measured and correct materials 
and dimensions verified against vendor drawings.
	
3.	 This verification is needed because an estimated 5 percent of 
spare components are flawed for one reason or another and 
will have to be reworked or replaced to be suitable for use in 
the compressor. In one documented case, 14% of all spare 
parts were found in need of rectification before a major turn-
around was commenced.1
	
4.	 While the equipment is still in operational service and 
approximately 9 months before a planned shutdown, a list of 
likely defective parts in the equipment must be generated. This 
list must be compiled on the basis of predictive maintenance 
(PdM) monitoring and preliminary root cause failure identi-
fication meetings. A vendor’s field engineer may have to be 
hired to do the verification work described in (1); this field 
person must bring along whatever proprietary vendor’s 
drawings are not otherwise available at the user’s site.
Inspection
	
1.	 Careful visual inspection must be performed after removing 
the top half of the compressor or, in the case of barrel-type 
construction, after the rotor is removed from the machine. 
Typical deviations are shown on a sketch (Fig. 9.1).
• Photograph the rotor in its “as received” condition. In 
addition, close-up color photos are to be taken of any 
unusual or abnormal condition, and a photo log should be 
maintained for all work performed. Identification of all 

I n s p e c t i o n  a n d  R e p a i r  G u i d e l i n e s  f o r  R o t o r s 	
101
items, including equipment number and part name, 
should be clearly shown on all photographs.
• Take samples of residues and deposits.
• Photograph any unusual appearances and note abnormal 
looseness or tightness.
• Also, measure and document dimensions from a distinct 
shaft feature (such as a shaft shoulder etc, Fig. 9.2) to vari-
ous important locations along the rotor axis.

• Measure and record all diameters as shown in Fig. 9.3. 
(Note: All micrometers must be checked for correct cali-
bration against a precision standard prior to use.)
• As clearly defined in a job scope or instruction document, 
a designated member of the owner’s workforce, the OEM 
vendor-manufacturer, or the designated outside-repair 
contractor should make two electronic sets of standard 
color photos.
• The distance to the centerline of the vibration probe area 
should be recorded on each end of the rotor (Fig. 9.4) to

allow quality control of runouts during repair. Afterward, 
the probe areas must be adequately protected from dam-
age such as rusting or scratches that could otherwise 
occur before and during the rotor repair.
Cleaning
Prepare to clean the rotor to remove dirt, rust, and other foreign mate-
rial. (Important: Do not use steam to clean the assembled rotor.)
• Protect all bearings, seal, probe, and coupling surfaces before 
and during cleaning.

• Blast-clean with (1) glass beads, (2) walnut shells, or (3) grit, 
200 mesh or smaller.
• Coat all surfaces with a film of oil or other protective coating 
after cleaning.
• Unless otherwise specified in the job scope, use applicable 
nondestructive examination procedures (Magnaglo magnetic 
particle testing, or Zyglo liquid penetrant inspection) to 
determine the existence and location of any defects such as 
cracks on the rotor. Record the size, location, and orientation 
of any defects on a sketch. (Note: This step will not normally

Deficiency Mapping
Additional deficiencies may become evident after cleaning. The 
owner’s engineer must now fine-tune and update the sketch in Fig. 9.1.
	
1.	 Note on the same Fig. 9.1 or on a similar sketch the size, loca-
tion, and orientation of any rubs, erosion, corrosion, or other 
damage resulting in loss or displacement of material and/or 
buildup of deposits, including any in keyways or under 
impellers or sleeves. If build-up is substantial, remove a sam-
ple and take steps to have it analyzed, as needed. (Do not 
overlook the possibility of discovering more damage as you 
proceed. If deposits are suspected to have caused damage 
such as cracks, corrosion, etc, the repair work may have to be 
delayed until complete analysis is performed.)
	
2.	 Take additional photographs and relate them to the various 
sketches made earlier.
	
3.	 Regardless of who will have involvement in, or responsibility 
for the work, photograph the rotor in its “as received” condi-
tion. In addition, close-up color photos are to be taken of any 
unusual or abnormal condition, and a photo log should be 
maintained for all work. Identification of all items, including 
equipment number and part name must be clearly shown on 
all photographs. Unless otherwise specified in the jobs scope, 
make two (2) electronic copies of all photographs taken.
	
4.	 Measure and record all relevant and accessible dimensions 
of the rotor as received on a checklist worksheet designed 
for the particular rotor. (Note: All micrometers must be 
checked for correct calibration against a precision standard 
prior to use.)
	 (a)	 Impeller outside (“G”) and suction eye diameters (“D”) 
(Fig. 9.5).
 (b) Seal sleeves, spacers, and other running clearance regions 
(Figs. 9.6 and 9.7).
	
	   Journal and seal area diameters (check both ends and 
center of each area for roundness and taper, Figs. 9.4 and 
9.8). Record all dimensions.
	 (c)	 Coupling fits, Fig. 9.8 (if tapered, record minor and major 
diameters, length of taper, and percent of contact area, 
which is blued using a ring gage). Blade-type microme-
ters are preferred for tapered coupling fits. The stand-off 
dimension of the ring gage must also be recorded.
 
• Depth, length, location, and type of any coatings, 
overlays, etc.
 
• Gaps between all adjacent shrunk-on parts.

• Check all runouts with the shaft supported at the bear-
ing journals on “Vee” blocks. (Note: Vee block lengths 
must be at least equal to one-half of the bearing journal 
diameters. The entire length has to be used for support 
in the center of the journal, labeled B.J. in Fig. 9.6.)
 
• Runouts (including vibration-probe areas) should be 
logged-in relative to the coupling’s (driven end) key-
way centerline; this centerline is labeled the zero-phase 
reference. If the coupling area is double keyed or has 
no keyway, the thrust collar keyway will be used as 
the zero reference.
 
• If this is also not possible, an arrow should be stamped 
on the end of the shaft to show the plane of the zero-
phase reference. Runouts should be recorded as viewed 
from the coupling (driven) end of the rotor, while rolling 
the rotor in the direction of normal rotation (i.e., phase 
angle increasing opposite normal rotation).
 
• Check and record mechanical runout on shaft fit areas, 
seal areas, journals, probe target areas, and any other 
running clearance areas. As a minimum, axial runout 
must be recorded for each impeller suction eye and on 
both sides of the thrust collar (or on the thrust collar 
shaft shoulder if the thrust collar is removed). Mechani-
cal runout check locations and diameter measurements 
on compressor shaft could be combined, Fig. 9.9.
 
• Check and record vibration probe area runouts using 
a calibrated eddy current probe transducer (minimum 
instrumentation requirement for this type of runout

measurements). Prior to checking runouts in the 
probe region, record a graph of gap in 10 mil (0.010 in) 
versus transducer output voltage scale on the target 
area. There could possibly be more than one such tar-
get areas due to different metallurgical composition.
 
• On target areas less than 4 in in diameter, calibration 
must be performed radically on the shaft and appro-
priately noted on the calibration graph. Probe area 
runout tolerance is 0.25 mil (0.00025 in) of combined 
electrical and mechanical runout.
 
• Check and record axial stack-up dimensions, refer-
enced from the thrust collar shaft shoulder (or active 
side of the integral thrust collar), to each impeller (the 
gas path surfaces nearest the thrust collar) and to all 
other major components that may be removed from 
the shaft. (There are no exceptions to this important 
requirement.)
 
• Weigh and record the total weight of the rotor.
 
• Check balancing must be done on a spare rotor being 
readied for operational use and on rotors that have 
simply been cleaned.
 
• If both bearing journals are round within 0.0003 in, 
perform a check balance of the rotor, using fully 
crowned half keys in all exposed keyways.
 
• Record amounts, radii, and locations of required tem-
porary corrections, and weights of all half keys. (Note 
that check balancing is not required on rotors where 
damage had caused an obvious and large unbalance.)
 
    (When specified in the job scope or a related instruc-
tion document, dismantle the rotor completely. In that 
case, refer to Chapter 6 for details.)
 
5. Rotor Dismantling
 (a) During disassembly, check and record axial dimensions 
between the thrust collar shaft shoulder (or active side of 
the integral thrust collar) to the faces of the bores nearest 
the thrust collar on each impeller.
	 (b)	 Visually inspect each part removed, and measure and 
record all shaft and component sizes on the appropriate 
checklist for the rotor. (Measure for roundness and taper 
on both ends of each component.) These measurements 
must include:
• Bare shaft fit sizes, overall length, and runouts (including 
thrust collar shoulder).

110	
C h a p t e r  N i n e
• Impeller bore sizes, and lengths and widths of land fit 
areas.
• Bore sizes and lengths of shaft spacers, seal sleeves, 
etc.
• Balance piston bore size and length.
• Thrust collar and spacer bore sizes and lengths.
• Key clearances on all keyways. With keys installed in 
shaft keyways, measure from tops of keys to opposite 
side of shaft.
• Measure across bore of components to bottoms of key-
ways, then verify the dimensional compatibility of 
keys and keyway locations.
	
6.	 Nondestructive testing (NDT) or previously in service  
rotors
	
	   In general and unless otherwise specified in the job scope, 
the vendor or rebuild shop must use applicable nondestruc-
tive procedures (Magnaglo or Zyglo) after disassembly to 
determine the existence and location of any defects in the 
shaft and all component parts. The shaft should be ultrasoni-
cally tested in addition to the above. Record the size, location, 
and orientation of any defects on a sketch. Again, refer to 
Chapter 8 for more detail.
 
   Be sure to take the following steps for including appropri-
ate records and data:
	 (a)	 Photograph removed parts with abnormal or unusual 
conditions as described earlier in this chapter.
	 (b)	 Demagnetize all components and check and record resid-
ual magnetism on all parts of the rotor. Maximum allow-
able residual magnetism is 2.0 G, as measured with a 
digital Gauss meter and Hall-type probe.
	 (c)	 Request that owner’s engineer be notified upon comple-
tion of Phase I. A copy of all Phase I documentation must 
be submitted for his use and records. Evaluate the results 
of Phase I and review or prepare the job scope for neces-
sary repairs.
Phase II (Repairs)
The basis for such repair recommendations will be the minimum nec-
essary to produce a safe reliable rotor that will perform efficiently for 
normal plant runs. Select a repair facility (OEM or non-OEM) that 
agrees to provide repair recommendations based on these criteria for 
review by owner’s engineer prior to proceeding.

Phase III (Assembly and Balancing)
Owners’ engineers should be involved in every decision that affects 
the long-term reliability of centrifugal compressors. They must deter-
mine if the manufacturer or repair facility adheres to standards that 
have long been maintained by reliability-focused users. While not 
every one of the various requirements may deserve to be rigidly 
enforced, the impact of deviating from them must be clearly under-
stood. Therefore, except in situations where the manufacturer or repair 
shop has even more stringent requirements, the deviation should be 
the subject of discussion and mutual agreement. All conclusions 
must be documented in writing. Even the support mandrels used for 
impeller balancing must be precisely machined and balanced. Good 
mandrels contribute balance quality vibration-free operation to cen-
trifugal compressor rotors.
	
1.	 Dynamically balance the bare shaft to tolerance 4W/N per 
plane, using fully-crowned half keys in all keyways. In this 
expression, W equals the weight of the workpiece in pounds, 
and N equals the maximum continuous speed of the compressor 
in RPM. The result is expressed as “ounce-inches” and further 
explanations can be found in balancing-related texts. In any 
event, when half keys are required, use keys that completely fill 
the keyway(s) and record the weight of each key.
	
	   Half keys are not required if two conditions are met:
	 (a)	 There are an equal number of keyways 180 degrees apart 
on each side of the shaft and no two adjacent keyways are 
in the same side of the shaft, and
	 (b)	 All keyway lengths and depths are the same.
 
2. Set-up each individual impeller in a lathe or vertical boring 
mill and indicate the bore centerline true to within 0.0001 in.
	
3.	 Record all phase-related runouts on the suction eye face and 
periphery. Zero phase will be at the impeller keyway. If impel-
lers are not keyed, zero phase must be stamped on the suction 
eye face.
	
4.	 All runouts must be recorded while turning the impeller in the 
direction of normal rotation and as viewed from the suction 
side. With the bore trued, the face of the suction eye should not 
run out in excess of 0.002 in total indicator reading (TIR).
	
5.	 Machine an indicator flat on the suction eye face if runouts 
exceed 0.002 in TIR.
 
6. Special instructions pertain to the mandrels used for impeller 
(“wheel”) balancing. It is necessary to individually balance, 
on a balancing mandrel, each wheel and the balance piston. 
Tapered spring mandrels are not allowed.

112	
C h a p t e r  N i n e
 
7. Similarly, mandrels with measurable eccentricity noted by a 
dial indicator graduated in 0.0001 in increments are not 
acceptable to reliability-focused users. Before mounting any 
wheel, the mandrel itself should have a ground finish and be 
precision-balanced prior to cutting any keyways.
 
8. Balance tolerance in ounce/inches must be determined for 
each plane by the formula 4W/N. A keyway to accept the 
component’s job key must then be cut in the finished 
mandrel.
 
9. Key top clearance should not be allowed to exceed 0.005 in. 
Each part balanced should have a 0.002 in minimum interfer-
ence fit to the mandrel and a maximum interference fit equal 
to that between the impeller and the shaft.
 10. Unless agreed by the owner’s engineer, component and face 
runouts must duplicate those recorded in Step (b). Record 
phase-related runouts for each component mounted on the 
mandrel prior to balancing.
	 11.	 A residual unbalance test must be performed on the first of a 
series of like components for each different balance machine 
used. This typically consists of a minimum of six test points 
(60 degrees apart), with additional points possibly required 
to ascertain that minimum and maximum readings are 
obtained.
	 12.	 If balance machine readouts are found to be in error by more 
than 25 percent as verified by the residual test, a residual 
unbalance test should be performed and recorded for each 
component.
	 13.	 Normally, all impellers are being heated in a temperature-
controlled oven for assembly to the shaft. Permission must be 
obtained from the owner’s engineer prior to using torches for 
assembly.
	 14.	 On rotors that stack from the center out, allow stacking two 
(2) wheels or components at a time. On rotors that stack from 
one end, only stack one wheel or component at a time. All 
half keys shall be left in place in shaft keyways until it 
becomes necessary to replace them with the job keys.
	 15.	 At no time during the stacking process shall unbalance be 
induced by uneven distribution or lack of proper half keys. 
After each stacking step, allow all components to cool to 
120°F or less.
	 16.	 Runouts should not change more than 0.0003 in TIR between 
component stacks, accounting for any phase differences, and 
must be recorded after each stacking step. The rotor must 

I n s p e c t i o n  a n d  R e p a i r  G u i d e l i n e s  f o r  R o t o r s 	
113
again be turned in the direction of normal rotation during 
balancing, using the same plane of zero-phase reference that 
was used during runout checks.
 17. Unless a particular compressor manufacturer or rebuild shop 
has reason and proven experience demanding otherwise, 
after each stacking step, the previously stacked impeller(s) 
should be “heat soaked” while rotating 300 to 500 RPM.
	 18.	 This is done by rapidly heating each impeller to 350°F to 
400°F at the disc fit (closed side, also called “heel” in Fig. 9.5) 
only, using a “rosebud” torch. Be certain not to heat the shaft 
or the impeller cover fit (called “toe” in Fig. 9.5).
	 19.	 Allow to cool to 120°F or less.
	 20.	 Indicate impeller and shaft for runout. Maximum allowance 
is 0.001 in TIR on the shaft and 0.002 in TIR measured axially 
at the face of the impeller eye. Further, assembled component 
runouts must match those recorded in paragraph C within 
0.001 in TIR accounting for any phase differences. If runout 
exceeds tolerance, then destack, check shaft runout, and 
finally restack.
	 21.	 Check the rotor balance after each stacking phase. If balance 
corrections are necessary, they must be confined to the last 
component(s) stacked only, without any corrections (tempo-
rary or otherwise) on other components. Continue this until 
the rotor stacking process is complete.
 22. Unless otherwise specified and agreed to, the compressor 
manufacturer or repair shop should perform and record a 
residual unbalance after each wheel is mounted and balanced 
on the shaft. (In many agreements between owner and manu-
facturer, balancing of the first and last wheels is to be wit-
nessed by the owner’s engineer.)
	 23.	 Record keyway clearances during stack balancing as outlined 
in Phase I. Permissible top clearances should range from 
0.003 to 0.006 in.
	 24.	 Axial clearance between each impeller spacer and balance 
piston should be 0.002 to 0.005 in.
	 25.	 Trim balance the final assembly to a balance tolerance of 
4W/N (explained above as four times the journal static weight 
in each plane divided by the maximum operating speed).
	 	
Example 1  A wheel weighing 100 lb that operates at 10,000 RPM = 
	 	
(100 × 4)/10,000 = 0.04 oz-in.
	 	
Example 2  A six-stage rotor weighing 1800 lb operating at 10,000 
RPM with equal journal loading. It would equate to 1800 divided 

114	
C h a p t e r  N i n e
by two planes = 900 lb per plane. Thus, (4 × 900)/10,000 = 3600 
divided by 10,000 RPM = 0.36 oz-in (left plane) and 0.36 oz-in 
(right plane).
	 26.	 Perform and document a four (4)-point residual unbalance 
check for each end of the rotor after final trim balancing is 
complete.
	 27.	 Document all sizes, runouts (phase related to coupling key-
way or other specified reference), fits, etc, and submit all 
original documentation with the final repair report within 3 
days of job completion. For comparison purposes, final axial 
stack-up dimensions should be recorded as was done in 
Phase I, without exception. Unless otherwise specified in the 
job scope, final axial stack-up dimensions shall match those 
recorded during “as received” inspection within 0.015 in 
maximum deviation.
	 28.	 Check residual magnetism on the completed rotor. Maximum 
allowable is 2.0 G, as measured with a digital gauss-meter 
and Hall-type probe.
	 29.	 Check and record vibration probe area for electrical/mechan-
ical runout as outlined earlier in Phase I. Make corrections, as 
necessary. Maximum allowable runout is 0.25 mil (0.00025 in) 
peak-to-peak, combined electrical and mechanical runout. 
Acceptable correction methods include burnishing, rolling, 
and micro-peening.
PHASE IV (Preparation for Storage or Shipment)
	
1.	 Coat the rotor thoroughly with a product suitable for a pre-
defined storage or in-transit time. (Recall that steam is not 
allowed for cleaning the assembled rotor at any time.)
 
2. Wrap each probe target area separately, using MIL B-121 bar-
rier material. Tape these areas and mark each with the words 
“Probe Area.” Afterward, wrap the entire rotor using MIL 
B-121 barrier material.
	
3.	 Follow approved shipping or storage instructions.
	
4.	 If the rotor is to be shipped, the owner’s engineer must 
approve the proposed shipping crate. Minimum material to 
be used: 4 in-by-4 in for the skid; 2 in-by-4 in for the box 
frame; ½ in-thick plywood for the sides and top.
	
5.	 The box should be marked “Fragile, lift only while support-
ing the bottom.” The box should also be marked with the 

I n s p e c t i o n  a n d  R e p a i r  G u i d e l i n e s  f o r  R o t o r s 	
115
owner-purchaser’s company name and should be marked as 
the owner-purchaser’s property.
	
6.	 The rotor must be supported rigidly at both bearing journals 
and in the center when crated. Acceptable materials for use 
between the wrapped journals and the supports are lead, 
PTFE, a high-performance polymer, or a Micarta-like product.
What We Have Learned
Existing rotors are first photographed when the compressor is opened 
at the owner’s site. They are again very carefully mapped at the point 
of receiving, usually at a repair facility.
Each work procedure and repair step must be defined in writing. 
It is understandable that an owner-purchaser may not have the time 
or inclination to become a compressor designer; however, an owner-
purchaser’s staff member must ask questions that relate to a com-
pressor repair. These questions must be answered by the OEM or 
non-OEM repair facility.
You should refuse to entrust your machine to a repair shop that 
is hesitant to describe its work processes or procedures. There should 
be no such thing as a proprietary repair or fabrication procedure that 
cannot be divulged to the compressor owner. It’s your property; 
don’t allow details to be hidden from the owner-purchaser’s view or 
scrutiny.
Finally, remember again that you will get what you inspect. You 
will not get what you expect.

CHAPTER 10
Machinery Quality 
Assessment
M
achinery quality assessment (MQA) is a multifaceted work 
effort aimed at uncovering risks and vulnerabilities that 
exist in low-cost or prototype-like compressor offers.1 It has 
been estimated that MQA efforts require an up-front prestartup 
investment of 5% of the cost of equipment and will ultimately yield a 
10-fold return on this incremental investment. Only experienced staff 
can make these assessments, and even they may need assistance from 
qualified third-party machinery specialists. Together, the purchaser’s 
MQA staff and the outside contractors reach consensus and report 
their findings to the project manager.
Best-of-class companies use MQA on critically important com-
pressors and drivers. The MQA effort consists of structured and defin-
able reviews of drawings, calculations, and other documentation. 
MQA tasks and pursuits are separated into three phases.
Phase 1 efforts take place before a purchase order is issued; they 
are concentrating on vendor capabilities and specification develop-
ment. The plant’s operating philosophy, its location, available labor 
pool, cost of a day’s outage, desired plant availability, and a host of 
other considerations determine which vendors are invited to bid and 
what should be the extent of supply. The value of potential pre-
investment in future capacity expansion is among the various issues 
defined during Phase 1.
Phase 2 efforts are generally called design audits. They are struc-
tured endeavors that take place approximately 6 weeks after a purchase 
order has been issued. A design audit is conducted at the compressor 
vendor’s design and manufacturing location and concentrates on com-
pressor details that are only obtainable from near-finalized design 
drawings or calculations.
As an example, the audit may uncover that the vendor intends to 
use a thrust bearing that has a certain load rating. At this point, the 
audit team may request calculations that show the overload capacity 
of this particular thrust bearing and decide that it does not allow for 
brief periods of operation in surge. The compressor manufacturer is 

118	
C h a p t e r  T e n
asked to design the surrounding space such that a larger bearing 
could be accommodated. The future owners are advised to purchase 
a next-size-larger spare thrust bearing and update the spare parts list 
in accordance with this decision.
Phase 3 is an ongoing review of vendor compliance with specifi-
cations, monitoring of the vendor’s manufacturing progress, and 
resolution of any issues that could affect timely delivery of a quality 
product. Phase 3 starts where Phase 2 ends and is winding down 
after the fully installed machine is handed over to, and accepted by, 
the owner-operator. This date usually coincides with the completion 
of test runs at the destination facility.
Detailed Specifications Are Needed
Whenever compressors are required for a project, their duties or 
performance requirements must be described on a design basis, in a 
general instruction document, and in one or more specifications. 
The specification requirement applies to all compressors. For cen-
trifugal process gas compressors, the basic specification may simply 
be API-617; additional requirements are usually tabulated and ref-
erenced by the experienced purchaser. It is not appropriate to simply 
invoke the somewhat general API-617 as a stand-alone reference 
document. This is because API-617 contains a number of “bulleted” 
items which require a decision or choice to be made by the owner-
purchaser.2
Many of these “bullets” in API-617 refer to options that predefine 
or delineate extent of supply. As just one example, a decision is to be 
made on which party will be responsible for base plates common to 
driver and driven machine. There also are options to be spelled out 
on control instruments and the like. More detail is often needed: 
Unless the purchaser defines who will preprime the underside of a 
base plate and what type of primer is to be used, chances are that this 
detail will get overlooked. Once the discrepancy is discovered, it will 
consume much time and money to rectify. At that time there will be 
pressure to make compromises and long-term reliability will be sacri-
ficed in the interest of expediency and cost-cutting.
The degree of detail given by the specifying entity depends 
largely on the risk tolerated by an owner-purchaser. Compressor 
owners must take a position on how much maintenance they are will-
ing to perform and how many planned shutdowns should be sched-
uled over the projected life of the compressor and its driver. The 
answers will certainly depend on many factors, including the cost of 
labor. As mentioned earlier, geographic location or remoteness of 
the installation and the quality of the workforce members assigned 
to operational and maintenance-technical tasks are also factors to 
consider.

M a c h i n e r y  Q u a l i t y  A s s e s s m e n t 	
119
Briefing Project Executives on MQA
To be sure of obtaining reliable machinery, the project executive 
should be made aware of three very important issues. If any of the 
three are ignored, the reliability of an installation is likely to suffer.
	
1.	 Some project budgets allow only for procurement of the least-
expensive machine. If one purchases inexpensive compres-
sors, odds are overwhelming against equipment reliability. 
The machine will likely require more frequent maintenance 
intervals or will simply fail more often than a compressor 
that has been subjected to prepurchase MQA, or machinery 
quality assessment.
	
2.	 The project budget must include the cost of an up-front MQA. 
Together, the up-front audit and subsequent ongoing reli-
ability reviews will amount to approximately 5 percent of the 
equipment cost.
	
3.	 The purchaser’s intent to perform part of this machinery 
quality assessment (MQA) at the bidders’ or compressor 
manufacturer’s factory location will cause an expense to the 
manufacturer. Bidders must be made fully aware of this 
requirement and their total, all-inclusive cost proposals must 
reflect this requirement.
Project funding must also reflect the three phases of the machinery 
quality assessment effort. Phase 1 involves job functions beyond 
machinery engineers. Three or four experienced specialists participate 
in Phase 2, the audit. A designated experienced machinery engineer 
does most of the reliability review work comprising Phase 3 and acts 
as the focal point person or coordinator of review input contributed 
by electrical engineers, or welding experts, and so forth. Reliability 
reviews (Phase 3) involve a machinery engineer full-time; the other 
subject matter experts contribute on an as-needed, part-time, basis.
Only Competent Manufacturers Are Invited to Submit Bids
Applying wisdom to the compressor procurement process requires 
that we identify the three or four manufacturers we wish to invite. In 
other words, we want to devote all of our attention to bidders from 
whom we would purchase a compressor in the size and flow and 
pressure range under consideration.
During the early definition phase of a project, a designated indi-
vidual or team of individuals must compile a list of competent suppliers. 
Suppliers or bidders must be in a position to represent and support 
their product in the geographic region where the compressor(s) will 
ultimately be installed. It must be ascertained that a potential supplier 

120	
C h a p t e r  T e n
has retained its presumed legacy design and quality control. In 
many cases it will be necessary to arrange for a plant visit. Qualified 
compressor vendors are then invited to submit a detailed bid, or 
proposal.
The question on how long one can run compressors before sched-
uling turnaround inspection must be answered. Of course, unex-
pected outages can be extremely expensive and even a scheduled 
outage event can negatively affect a facility’s balance sheet. We have 
had occasion to listen to opinions as well as field experience on the 
topic of shutdown frequency from both engineering staff and man-
agement personnel. Needless to say, the opinions are divided not 
only between the two groups, but also among the engineers involved 
and within the management groups themselves.
With so much money at stake, how should one approach the issue 
and how might a reasonably precise numerical answer be obtained? 
Obtaining a very precise numerical answer will forever elude us since 
there are far too many variables involved.
The life expectancy of centrifugal compressor components is 
prone to be influenced by gas conditions, purity, corrosivity, and 
other parameters. Process facilities experience occasional upsets and 
acceptable control is not always maintained. Operation at varying 
speeds may subject compressor impellers to different steady-state 
and alternating stresses. Lube oil quality and purity can easily affect 
bearings and seal systems. Electronic governing systems for com-
pressor drivers may be influenced by ambient conditions and compo-
nent drift, or maintenance oversights and operator error. Redundancy 
may have to be specified for some subsystems. Multiple layers of pro-
tection are often highly desirable.
Making a reasonably accurate assessment of prudent operating 
time to the next scheduled turnaround inspection is difficult. The 
engineer responsible for it will have to review all of the above and 
many more factors. A thorough investigation of the experience and 
service condition of machines similar to those intended for a new proj-
ect will be of value. Comparisons of stress levels on bearings, seals, 
impellers or, in the case of axial compressors, identical compressor 
blades operating elsewhere should be pursued. Evaluation of “their” 
actual maintenance procedures against “our” projected maintenance 
procedures would also be appropriate.
We have seen over the years that much of this information is easi-
est obtained during preprocurement reviews of the particular design 
offered by a compressor manufacturer. These preprocurement reviews 
(Phase 1) are not to be confused with design audits (Phase 2) and 
ongoing reviews (Phase 3). We know of relatively few procurement 
situations where capable vendors would not show a willingness to 
explain in detail their prior experience for the service conditions 
imposed on the proposed machinery. In other words, capability and 

M a c h i n e r y  Q u a l i t y  A s s e s s m e n t 	
121
the ability to demonstrate satisfactory experience go hand in hand. A 
good vendor has nothing to hide.
Service conditions take into account parameters found in com-
prehensive data sheets. Most of these parameters are found in the 
appendix material to API-617. Service condition listings and reviews 
must include driver startup (slow-roll) time, input power demand, 
rating, experience relating to gas molecular weight, impeller tip 
speed, gas temperature, and pressure. Prior experience in these and 
other parameters should be established and extrapolations from past 
designs pointed out. Along these lines, capable vendors can usually 
demonstrate mechanical design experience for applicable critical 
parameters which could include:
· Bearing span
· Bearing design, loading, size, and clearance
· Impeller design—structural and thermodynamic
· Casing size and design
· Nozzle or guide vane orientation
· Casing-joint design configuration, gasket types selected, and 
bolting
· Coupling design and arrangement
· Surge limits and proposed surge control schemes
· Material selection
· Compressor suction and discharge nozzle sizing for conserva-
tive gas velocity
· Compressor discharge nozzle sizing for acceptably low gas 
velocity under future upgrade  (especially, increased through-
put) conditions
· Number of stages and staging arrangement
· Power transmission components (design and arrangement of 
gears, couplings, and coupling guards)
· Rotor dynamics
· Sealing systems
To then lay the groundwork for answering future questions on 
mean-time-between-turnaround inspections, the responsible engi-
neer (the owner’s engineer) would do well to expand his or her 
review of a vendor’s mechanical design experience so as to include 
requests for operating and maintenance feedback from other 
installations.
During the second phase of MQA, the review engineer makes use 
of a checklist. He or she will ascertain compliance with specifications 

122	
C h a p t e r  T e n
and will ask for whatever data are needed to ascertain a machine 
reliable.3 Among the checklist items will be
· Completed API data sheets
· Cross-section drawing with internal radial and axial clearances
· Labyrinth clearances
· Dimensioned general arrangement drawing showing all pro-
cess gas, cooling water, and electrical connections
· Input and results of rotor sensitivity (dynamics) study, 
including bearing, support, stiffness, and damping behavior 
as a function of rotor speed 
· Input and results of a torsional critical speed analysis, if required
· Individual impeller performance curves indicating polytropic 
head and impeller efficiency
· Overall compressor performance curves
· Dimensioned thrust-bearing drawing and final calculated 
thrust load
· Dimensioned radial bearing drawings and loadings
· Driver versus load torque/speed demand curve
· Dimensioned coupling cross-section drawings with shaft end 
assembly procedures and fits
· Input data for a rotor thrust analysis by third party
· Results of vendor’s axial load (thrust) analysis with both new 
and worn balance piston labyrinth clearances
· Dimensioned shaft seal drawing
· Alignment offset data (to accommodate thermal rise)
· Procedures for factory and field test runs
· Minimum stable flow
· Discharge temperature
· Design, settling-out, and hydrostatic pressures
· Flange size, rating, face, orientation

What We Have Learned
Machinery quality assessment is an up-front activity that typically 
consumes 5% of the cost of machinery. This cost must be allocated 
and reflected in the project budget.
Without performing MQA on process gas compressors it will be 
near impossible to build a highly reliable plant. New projects that 

128	
C h a p t e r  T e n
incorporate the least expensive first cost “bare-bones” compression 
equipment and appurtenances will not achieve the reliability and 
availability of plants that have made it their business to purchase 
optimized machinery.
MQA identifies optimized machinery. The cost of MQA is usually 
retrieved by the time a facility starts up. It has been estimated that the 
MQA effort pays back 10:1 over the projected life of a unit or plant.
MQA looks at more than just the compressors. Piping, layouts, 
auxiliaries, and vessels are among the items reviewed.
Checklists are extremely helpful; many are found in Ref. 3. Obtain-
ing answers to checklist items represents a networking, training, 
mentoring, and educational opportunity.

CHAPTER 11
Compressor Failure 
Analysis Overview
T
o demonstrate how an effective failure analysis should be 
framed and carried out, we opted to use a compressor-related 
example. This case history involves a three-dimensional 
impeller. It demonstrates the straightforward thinking processes 
and analysis approaches that have worked well for us in the past.
It has been said that failure analysis and troubleshooting must be 
preceded by stating what the problem is. The problem is always a 
deviation from the expected norm. In the overwhelming majority of 
cases, more than one seemingly minor deviation combines with other 
seemingly insignificant deviations. The combined minor deviations 
then lead to the observed problem. Not addressing compressor prob-
lems can lead to calamities that range from simple annoyance to utter 
devastation.
Problems cannot be solved without data. Repairs carried out 
without understanding what led up to a failure will usually result in 
repeat failures. So, we must first gather data and then organize the 
data into evidence of things good and evidence of things bad or 
defective. We also need timelines and time-based observations. We 
must pay attention to actions and events that preceded the failure. All 
actions and events are of interest, the acceptable as well as the ques-
tionable, the interesting ones as well as those that might have bored 
you when you first found out about them.1
From an interrogation of timelines and time-linked observations 
we can ask “So what?” Answers to our questions allow us to make a 
good guess, or a best guess. Occasionally, we benefit from additional 
data—data needed to justify our best guess. The data must at all times 
line up with science and every scientific law on the books. Speculations 
to the contrary are unprofessional and are a waste of time. To assume 
that our company is the first ever to experience a particular type of 
failure is not something we encourage. Similarly, to think that ours will 
become the first commercial enterprise that will get away with numerous 
deviations occurring simultaneously is an unprofitable assumption 
that reliability professionals should not endorse.2

Case History Dealing with Impeller Failure
Suppose we had to determine why a three-dimensional impeller, 
similar to the style shown earlier in Fig. 7.2 or as depicted in Fig. 11.1, 
had failed. Suppose further that this “mixed-flow” impeller incorpo-
rates a number of freestanding blades and the blades are attached by 
welding. A three-step approach allows competent reliability profes-
sionals to quickly zero in on the most probable root causes of failure.3 
The analysis starts out by explaining the seven root cause methodology, 
the “FRETT” examination and, finally, appropriate model validation 
procedures.
Failure Analysis Step No. 1: The “Seven Root Cause Category” 
Approach4
The first of the three failure analysis steps is called the “Seven Root 
Cause Category Examination.” It is solidly based on the premise that 
all machinery failures fall into one or more of only seven possible 
cause categories:
	
1.	 Design errors
	
2.	 Material defects
	
3.	 Fabrication and processing errors
	
4.	 Assembly and installation deficiencies
	
5.	 Maintenance-related or procedural errors

131
	
6.	 Unintended operating conditions
	
7.	 Operator error
We use a process of elimination to determine which of the seven 
cause categories should be deleted and which one, or perhaps two, 
hold the key to a failure event. Using logical thought processes, we 
narrow things down. First off, we would simply ask ourselves which 
of these seven cause categories are influenced by the compressor 
user, and which ones are under the full jurisdiction of the compressor 
manufacturer. The answer determines the cause categories where 
failure analysis efforts should be concentrated.
We must start with what we know about this compressor. We must 
have data; we cannot solve a problem without data. Therefore, we must 
examine what the record shows and what the record does not show.
Suppose the impeller had 19 blades and there is no indication in 
the record that its user/owner had ever operated the machine at 
unintended speeds or other unauthorized conditions. Also, all gas 
properties had been disclosed to the vendor at the inception of the 
procurement chain. Had there been prolonged surge (operation at 
low flow), we would have expected thrust bearing damage, but no 
such damage had been experienced at the time of blade failure.
We assume it had thus been ascertained that no operator error 
occurred. Accordingly, categories (6) and (7) are now being ruled out. 
Assume further that during compressor maintenance there is no logical 
causal event fitting into the assembly and installation, or maintenance/
procedural error categories. Anyone making the statement “it could 
have been an assembly error” would have to explain what exactly could 
have been misassembled and would have to show data or measure-
ments in support of such a claim or statement.
With (4) and (5) thus being ruled out, we might focus next on item 
(2), material defects, but again find no metallurgical evidence of flaws 
in the base material selected by the manufacturer.
The reviewer would thus be left with the two cause categories 
design error (1) and fabrication and processing errors (3). We would 
be left with these two for closer investigation and scrutiny.
Failure Analysis Step No. 2: “FRE T T”4
It is universally recognized that all machinery component failures, or 
machine distress brought down to the mechanical component level, are 
attributable to one or two of only four failure mode sets. These four pos-
sibilities are force, reactive environment, time, and/or temperature. An 
easily remembered acronym, “FRETT,” allows us to recall these four 
possible initiators. FRETT is such an important concept that we will 
repeat the message by formulating it in different words:
All machine components will fail due to deviations in allowable force 
(F), or exposure to a reactive environment (RE), or time (T) in one 

132	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
extreme or another, or temperature deviation (T). As we look at a 
component and study its operating history, we should be able to 
determine what deviation was involved.
Getting back to our impeller example, assume we had studied the 
matter. Studying includes reviewing accumulated data from various 
sources and ascertaining some facts. Say, hundreds of compressor 
impellers in identical gas service had accrued operating hours far in 
excess of those at issue in this failure event. Hence, the impeller did 
not fail because the machine ran for too long and we could immedi-
ately rule out “time.”
One would also rule out “temperature,” since (assume you were 
able to ascertain) the actual compressor-operating temperatures had 
always remained well within the acceptable range. Likewise, one 
might discount the suspicion that corrosion (a reactive environment) 
was responsible for the failures if (a) it could be shown that the owner’s 
gas composition did not measurably deviate from that disclosed in 
the original specification documents and (b) a metallurgical exam 
showed no evidence of such corrosion.
That clearly would leave the reviewer with “force” as the only 
remaining logical failure mode set. The issue might be what type of 
force acted on the impellers, or where the force came from. This is 
where one might rely on data collected by suitable instrumentation 
and data collector modules. Remember, the failed impellers had 19 
blades and it is well known that failures can occur due to blade pass-
ing frequencies (BPFs) coinciding with impeller natural frequencies. 
We would recall the discussion on vibration behavior (Chapter 5) 
and look for amplitude excursions at a frequency of 19-times-RPM, 
38-times-RPM, and other multiples. Moreover, we would search for 
the presence of acoustic pulsing at BPF in the balance line connecting 
compressor discharge and first-stage suction inlet. Unless the owner 
has in-house expertise, a consulting company would be selected to 
do further investigation. They would probably find blade-passing 
frequencies (or multiples) that coincide with the impeller speed. Such 
coincidences are causing resonant vibration and fatigue failure at the 
welded junction of blade and hub.
Or, we would recall that, in some services, there is compressor 
fouling (Figs. 11.2 and 11.3). Chunks of hard or solid deposits may 
come loose and strike the downstream blading while the compressor 
is operating. The two arrows in Fig. 11.2 indicate that foulants can 
become rather thick; continuous on-stream injecting of up to 3 percent 
(by weight) of a suitable liquid is recommended. Part of the liquid 
must be injected into the suction piping and the remainder gets 
injected through small nozzles into the diaphragm passages. Inter-
mittent liquid injection is discouraged because it can be ineffective. 
Continuous injection of flush liquid into the compressor will prevent 
formation and deposition of foulant, as will certain coatings applied 
to compressor impellers.

C o m p r e s s o r  F a i l u r e  A n a l y s i s  O v e r v i e w 	
133
If solid foulants are present, we might pursue “Force” as the 
potential basic agent of part and component failure mechanisms. 
Depending on the distance traveled by a solid chunk of fouling 
deposit, the force of impact could be calculated and an assessment 
made as to the overload this might have represented on a blade.
Step No. 3: Validation, or Relating Analytical Models  
to Field Experience
Whenever an impeller design or other component is “modeled” for 
computer analysis, the analyst will generally make a number of 
assumptions and the validity of these assumptions must be ascertained. 
Common sense tells us that there are four possibilities and corre-
sponding definite conclusions, as follows:
	
1.	 Analysis says “OK,” but compressor part fails: model or 
analysis technique flawed
Figure 11.2  Fouling deposits in the eye of a closed impeller (Ref. 5).
Figure 11.3  Fouled compressor diaphragm passages.

134	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
	
2.	 Analysis says “OK,” and compressor part survives: model 
and analysis technique OK
	
3.	 Analysis says “not OK,” compressor part also fails: model 
and analysis technique OK
	
4.	 Analysis says “not OK,” but compressor part survives: model 
or analysis technique flawed
But suppose the manufacturer’s analysis claims that the design 
of a failed component was acceptable, yet the owner experienced 
repeat failures. In the absence of root cause factors other than 
design and/or fabrication, the reviewer would be led to the logical 
conclusion that the manufacturer’s model or analysis technique 
was flawed.
If you have experienced such component failures, look for tacit 
acknowledgement of this conclusion on the part of the vendor. In the 
case of impeller failure, the manufacturer perhaps no longer recom-
mends operating these compressors at speeds that correspond to the 
BPF interference mentioned earlier. Or, the manufacturer switched 
from welded blades to a superior fabrication method employing 
four-axis machining on a single block of material of suitable metal-
lurgical composition. That would support the notion of a flawed 
computer model. You would concentrate your investigative work on 
the success of milled impeller redesigns. These redesigns could logi-
cally be expected to cure the problem.
Whether we are dealing with a compressor component failure 
event or an unexplained compressor wreck, there are four cardinal 
rules that will apply:
	
1.	 Make sure things don’t get worse if you can help it. Get oth-
ers involved. “Others” are knowledgeable contributors and 
might include a plant superintendent, unit supervisors, and 
the fire department. Appropriate investigative techniques 
might include hazardous operations (HAZOP) analysis and 
consulting the rather straightforward troubleshooting tables 
reproduced elsewhere in this text (see index).
	
	   The immediate involvement of other personnel is especially 
valuable if an immediate emergency shutdown is required 
(true in the event of major hydrocarbon leaks, flying parts, 
fires, toxic gas releases, major safety or environmental issues, 
very loud unusual noises, or vibration excursions that keep 
getting worse).
	
2.	 Make sure shut down data are saved that could help in future 
troubleshooting (for example: vibration levels, pressures, tem-
peratures, process conditions).
	
3.	 Gather data. Get all data logs, computer data, vibration 
data, pressures, temperatures, and flows. Debrief or talk with 

C o m p r e s s o r  F a i l u r e  A n a l y s i s  O v e r v i e w 	
135
operators, process technicians, mechanics, and others on that 
shift, determine repairs and what was done, process changes, 
etc. Determine what parameters have changed in the time 
period between good operation and bad operation. The machine 
was operating OK a few days ago and now it clearly is not. 
What has changed? Get experts and equipment manufacturer 
field service specialists to help review data.
	
4.	 Make a decision based on available data and ask which parts 
are probably affected. Then determine if a shutdown is 
needed now, or if the machine can be safely operated prior to 
a scheduled down time. Develop plans for either case.
Troubles, causes, and remedies are collected and displayed in chart 
form. For each event, there may be one or two causes, at most. Inter-
rogate your own data and eliminate or delete causes for which you 
have no evidence. Again, each can be considered and deleted if there 
are no data supporting a potential cause. Use a process of elimination.

What We Have Learned
Buying reliable equipment is the most cost-effective path to failure 
avoidance. If one wants to have reliable compressors one must expend 
up-front effort. This preinvestment was described in Chapter 10. 
Called Machinery Quality Assessment (MQA), it will pay handsome 
dividends for decades and is the best path to failure avoidance.
When something does fails, we must use a structured approach 
and dig for a deviation buried in our own data. Without data, we are 
at best taking guesses and are setting ourselves up for repeat failures.
There are only seven failure cause categories; they are listed in the 
table. Paying attention to these categories, we must go through a pro-
cess of elimination to find the one, or at most two, wherein the flaw 
or defect is rooted.
We can be certain that compressor parts can only fail if a limiting 
value of F, RE, T, or T is exceeded. We know that deviations or viola-
tions tend to combine and cause major problems.
When doing failure analysis and troubleshooting, all findings 
and conclusions must be supported by data and must conform to 
science. Because the failure of compressor components is not influ-
enced by the supernatural, there will be logical explanations for 
everything.
Every effect has a cause, and in nearly 100% of all failure incidents a 
series of small contributing causes successively reduced the component 
failure margin. Ultimately several—in themselves small—deviations will 
combine into one big problem.
A conscientious machinery engineer will act even on small 
deviations.

CHAPTER 12
Reciprocating 
Compressors: 
Background and 
Overview
Introduction
Reciprocating compressors are flexible, efficient, have a wide range of 
applications, and can generate high heads or discharge pressures 
independent of gas density. They are the most common type of com-
pressors. Worldwide, the total installed horsepower of reciprocating 
compressors is about 2½ times that of centrifugal compressors.
The history of the reciprocating compressor dates back to antiq-
uity when bellows, wooden cylinders, and pistons were used to pro-
duce air blasts. The forerunners of the modern compressor did not 
make any noticeable progress until the middle of the 19th century. 
With industry making rapid advancements, particularly in the United 
States, a need developed for transportable energy in the form of com-
pressed air. Compressed air conducted in pipes was considered the 
best method, and somewhat superior to steam.1
Compressed air found its first practical large-scale application 
in the construction of tunnels. In the United States, the first such 
machine was used when the Hoosac Tunnel was constructed in 1866. 
The machine was a four cylinder, single-acting horizontal unit. It had 
poppet valves, used water for cooling, and was driven by a turbine 
wheel.
The compressor was later taken to a marble quarry where com-
pressed air for power drilling rapidly became an established practice. 
With the rapid progress of industry, new processes came into being and 
many new uses were devised for compressors. The petroleum industry 

142	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
took the lead and a large percentage of hydrocarbon-processing 
applications are still handled by reciprocating compressors.
Basic Operating Principle Explained
A reciprocating compressor raises the pressure of a gas by forcing a 
volume reduction. It accomplishes this through the movement of a 
piston, which is to say by the displacement of gas in a cylinder. In 
essence, reciprocating compressors are fixed capacity machines. Vari-
able capacity may be obtained either by changing the speed of the 
prime mover, by the use of suction valve lifters, or by the application 
of clearance pockets. Through the use of unloaders, it is possible to 
maintain constant horsepower over a wide range of pressure condi-
tions, thus enabling economic operation of the driver at all times.
Reciprocating compressors are designed and manufactured as 
both air-cooled (see Fig. 12.1) and water-cooled models (Fig. 12.2). 
Power ratings vary from fractional to more than 40,000 HP (30,000 kW) 
per unit. Pressures range from low vacuum at suction, to 30,000 psi 
(2000 bar) and higher at discharge for special process compressors. 
Small air compressors are usually single acting whereas the majority 
of the higher power machines are double acting. Double-acting 
compressors have pistons that compress gas at both ends of the

one end, the same piston is on its suction stroke on the other end of 
the same cylinder (see Fig. 12.3). Their strength lies in low-to-moderate 
flow (600–3000 ft3/min or 1000–5100 m3/h) applications, especially 
with low-molecular-weight gases, such as hydrogen and in applica-
tions where high discharge pressures (2000–5000 psi or 138–345 bar) 
are required. A map of reciprocating compressor capacity versus pres-
sure capability is shown in Fig. 12.4.

Reciprocating compressors are furnished with either a single 
stage or with many stages of compression (multistage). The number of 
stages is determined by the overall compression ratio. Compression 
ratio per stage and valve life are generally limited by the discharge 
temperature and the practical ratio usually does not exceed 4. 
However, small-sized units in intermittent duty are often furnished 
with compression ratios as high as 8.
On multistage machines, intercoolers are normally provided 
between stages. Intercoolers are heat exchangers which remove the heat 
of compression from the gas and reduce its temperature to approxi-
mately the temperature existing at compressor suction. At some constant 
pressure, a given mass of gas at low temperature takes up less volume 
than the same mass at a higher temperature. Therefore, cooling reduces 
the actual volume of gas going to the high-pressure cylinders, decreases 
the horsepower required for compression, and maintains the discharge 
temperature within safe operating limits.
Reciprocating compressors should be supplied with clean gas 
because they cannot satisfactorily handle liquids and solid particles 
that may be entrained in some gas supplies. Liquids and solid parti-
cles tend to degrade cylinder lubrication, damage valves, and cause 
cylinder liners to wear. Facilities such as filters, separators, and liquid 
knock-out drums upstream of the compressor are nearly always 
required.
Gas cylinders are generally lubricated, although a nonlubricated 
design is available when specified. Services usually requiring oil-free 
compression are, for example, nitrogen, oxygen, and instrument air 
services.
Most process-reciprocating compressors are designed to one of 
two prevalent industry-standard specifications: API Standard 618, 
Reciprocating Compressors for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry 
Services2 and API Specification 11P Specification for Packaged Recipro-
cating Compressors for Oil & Gas Production Services.3
The API 618 standard covers low-to-moderate speed compressors, 
typically in the 300 to 700 RPM speed range. These compressors may 
be of a separable balanced opposed design as shown in Fig. 12.2, but 
an “integral” design is also fairly common. An integral design refers 
to a compressor driven by a gas engine where the power cylinders of 
the engine that turns the crankshaft are in the same housing as the 
gas compression cylinders—see Figs. 12.5 and 12.6.
In standard API 618 compressors, the driver is separate from the 
compressor. These machines have historically been used in refineries 
and chemical plants, or the “downstream” section of compressor 
applications. Integral compressors use power cylinders whose pistons 
apply rotational torque to the same crankshaft that imparts motion 
to the compressor pistons. Integral compressors are often applied in 
pipeline service and also in inlet compression service at field gas 
plants. With the passage of time, the trend has been to replace old-style 

146	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
slow-speed integrals with gas turbine–driven centrifugal pipeline 
compressors, packaged medium-speed, gas engine–driven integrals, 
or electric motor–driven high-speed reciprocating compressors.
Separable API 618 compressors are relatively expensive. One way 
to reduce their overall cost in refining or other downstream applica-
tions is to group individual compression cylinders for multiple ser-
vices. That means placing one or more cylinders for each service on 
the same frame and drive motor, an approach known as multiservicing. 
Careful engineering is needed in such instances and overload capacity

needs to be built into the frame. For conservatism and low failure 
risk, operating loads on piston rods should not exceed 85 to 90 percent 
of the manufacturer’s maximum, continuous, combined rod load 
rating at relief valve setting.
Reciprocating compressors for hydrogen recovery in the PSA 
(Pressure Swing Adsorption) process serve as a good illustration of 
multiservicing. Here, one of the services consists of product-hydro-
gen compression and another of compressing the feedstock to the 
PSA unit. In addition, typically, the tail-gas or off-gas is compressed 
before being sent to a fuel header.
A typical multiservice hydrogen PSA compressor has two cylinders 
on feed compression, two cylinders on tail-gas compression, and one or 
two cylinders on hydrogen compression. Instead of three separate 
reciprocating compressors, only one multiple-throw unit is required. 
Compared with other layouts or geometries, capital and installation 
costs are lower with this configuration.
Reciprocating compressors excel over centrifugal compressors in 
that their design is very tolerant of molecular weight variations. This 
is of value in the hydrogen-recovery PSA process wherein the tail gas 
drawn from the PSA adsorption vessel varies in molecular weight. 
A centrifugal compressor in the same application would be subject to 
surge or flow reversal, unless it either employed variable-speed con-
trol or was designed to accommodate the variable-head requirements 
while retaining a fixed-speed design.
The API 11P standard covers packaged high-speed separable 
compressors with speeds from 600 to 1800 RPM. High-speed separa-
bles are frequently used in upstream applications such as field natu-
ral gas gathering and compression, as well as midstream gas trans-
mission pipeline and gas plant duties. A useful overview and 
comparison can be obtained from Table 12.1:

C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
A further differentiation may be made by looking at average 
piston speeds. Average piston speed is the average linear speed at 
which the piston travels during one revolution of the crankshaft, or 
through two stroke lengths. It is defined as follows in Eq. 12.1:
	
Average piston speed =
×
×
2
stroke
RPM
C
 ft/min (m/s) 	
(12.1)
where	stroke = in (mm)
	
C = 12 (60,000)
Average piston speed is an important parameter because it influ-
ences compressor MTBF or MTBR. Higher piston speeds usually 
result in accelerated wear of a reciprocating compressor’s sliding and 
rubbing interfaces. High-speed separables require more frequent 
and, possibly, more extensive maintenance than their more conserva-
tively designed low-speed counterparts. To expect otherwise can lead 
to disappointment.
However, Ref. 4 provides an interesting addition to Table 12.1 by 
alerting owner-purchasers to the existence of a third category of 
reciprocating compressors, namely the moderate-speed, short-stroke 
compressor line. This is shown in Table 12.2.
Today’s moderate-speed, short stroke compressor line finds use 
in typical upstream operation. In general and as of 2012, these recip-
rocating compressors are driven by a natural gas–fueled reciprocat-
ing engine. Made of lighter components and produced in relatively 
high volumes, these compressors are less expensive than the slow-
speed, reciprocating compressors that meet the API 618 standard. 
Their smaller, lightweight frames and low-mass moving components 
relate to smaller reciprocating forces and moments. They are often skid 
mounted or “packaged,” which reduces installation costs consider-
ably. Packaging results in a self-contained module. No utilities—such

as electricity—have to be brought to the package to enable it to operate. 
The engine burns field natural gas diverted from the compressed gas 
with no or minimal pretreatment. Being packaged makes the unit por-
table, which is quite often attractive to the upstream end user. Modern 
compressor packages are very sturdy and designed for installation 
with or without a foundation, depending on size. The skids are 
typically filled with concrete under all vessels, as well as in the entire 
engine and compressor-mounting structure. Additionally, the majority 
of larger skids—those in excess of ~1000 hp (746 kW)—are installed on 
an engineered foundation with an epoxy grout interface.
Downstream Process Reciprocating Compressors:  
Major Components
Discussing the typical downstream process reciprocating compressor 
has merit. Downstream machines are driven by an electric motor and 
are mounted directly onto a concrete block foundation. Electric 
motors are used almost exclusively because they are essentially main-
tenance free and have high availability. Reliability is then largely 
influenced by compressor-related issues, which includes the quality 
of associated controls (“ancillaries”) and instrumentation, auxiliary 
support systems, and equipment installation.
We keep in mind a second option available for today’s process 
market—the short-stroke, moderate-speed reciprocating compressor 
as described in Table 12.2. This is a high-speed, short-stroke compres-
sor that is driven by an electric motor at a speed that is typically 50 to 
65 percent of its full rated, upstream, natural gas engine–driven 
speed. This reduced speed allows the compressor to meet the reliabil-
ity requirements demanded by the process end user (Refs. 4 and 5).
Crankcase. The crankcase is a U-shaped cast iron or fabricated 
steel frame with the top left open for installation of the crankshaft 
shown in Fig. 12.7. To prevent the top from flexing (opening 
and closing) with the forces of the throws, it is held together by 
torqued bolts and spacers, or alternately keyed spacers. These 
major stabilizers are placed directly above the main bearings.

C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
The main bearings, spaced between each throw, have remov-
able top covers for access to the babbitted bearing shells. The 
keyed spacers are preferred and make access to bearing covers 
more easy. Main bearings for process gas compressors are often 
overdesigned and seldom require removal for repair. Of course, 
an overdesign would be of little help if dirty or inadequately 
formulated lubricants are used in these machines. Always use 
superior lubricants. They will be worth the incremental cost 
compared to an “acceptable” oil.
Crankshaft. The crankshaft is the central, and usually the most 
expensive, component of the machine. Each throw is forged 
and counterweights are bolted on to balance the reciprocat-
ing mass of the crosshead and piston. If the crankcase moves 
on its foundation, it will cause the throw to open and close 
through each revolution; it will then fatigue and break. For 
this reason, the dimension at the open end of the throw must 
be taken periodically while moving the crankshaft by barring  
it through 360 degrees. This is called taking crankshaft deflections 
and is part of a conscientious monitoring program, as outlined 
in Chapter 9.
Connecting rod. Connecting rods of the type shown in Fig. 12.8 
are called marine type; they incorporate pretorqued bolts fas-
tening the cap to the body at the crank end. The split is fitted 
with a stack of shims and one or more of these shims can be 
removed to compensate for bearing wear. The wrist pin is free-
floating, held in place with a cap in the crosshead, which allows 
the connecting rod to find its own center. Figure 12.9 shows a 
connecting rod and two articulating power piston rods of an 
integral gas engine compressor.
Crosshead. The crosshead, Fig. 12.10, traverses between two 
crosshead guides with a clearance of ~0.001 in/in of diameter.

151
Crossheads are often weighted so that the mass inertia of all recip-
rocating parts is sufficient to reverse the stress on the wrist pin, 
even when one end of the piston is under pressure. Unless load 
reversal (meaning stress reversal) occurs, the wrist pin will wipe 
the oil from the side under load. The pin will then make metal-
to-metal contact and will bind. An expensive repair event will be 
the result.

C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
Lubrication
Lubrication of the frame is accomplished by a pump driven from 
the crank end, which takes oil from the crankcase sump and pumps 
through a cooler and a 25 micron filter, then through piping to the 
main bearings in the frame (see Fig. 12.11). The crankshaft has 
holes drilled from the main bearing surface through the connecting 
rod-bearing face (refer back to Fig. 12.7). From the connecting 
rod-bearing face, the oil passes through a hole in the connecting rod 
to the wrist pin and from there through holes to the crosshead 
sliding faces. Oil scraper rings in the frame end prevent oil leakage 
out along the piston rod.
Because of the tortuous passage of the oil, prelubrication is 
required before startup. Most specifications call for a separate motor-
driven lube pump for this service. The prelube pump does not 
require the same flow rate as the main pump. Crankcase oil heaters 
are specified for outdoor compressors in cold climates to keep the oil 
at required viscosity and to prevent condensation which could cause 
corrosion. Oil, however, is a poor conductor and local overheating 
and carbonization has occurred when heaters with high watt-density 
(meaning small surface areas and high power input) were used. 
Therefore, when using crankcase heaters while a compressor is not 
in operation, the auxiliary lube pump should be continuously run.
It is important to note that the standard schematic of Fig. 12.11 
shows a branch line to the compressor cylinder lube system. This would 
imply that the same lubricant will be used for both compressor frame 
and cylinders. However, decades of compressor background will not 
allow the coauthors to endorse this universal one-oil-fits-all approach.

Experience at best-of-class plants points to numerous instances where a 
different lubricant will be of great benefit to the plant’s safety, reliability, 
and bottom-line cost. Certain synthetic lubricants have proven to be 
ideally suited for cylinder lubrication and these will be much preferred 
by reliability-focused compressor owner-operators.
Again, superior lubricants are easily cost-justified for cylinder 
lubrication. The extent to which these superior lubricants should also 
be used as the frame oil must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Materials of Construction
Up to a working pressure of 1000 psi, cylinders are normally made of 
(gray) cast iron. Above this pressure, materials of construction are 
cast steel or forged steel, at the manufacturer’s discretion. In terms of 
strength, nodular iron castings fit somewhere between gray cast iron 
and steel, but are difficult to cast. Some owner-purchasers will not 
allow nodular cast iron. There is concern with potential delivery 
delays in the event casting difficulties are encountered by the foundry.
API-618 specifies that all cylinders have replaceable liners. These 
are usually made of gray cast iron because of its lubricating and bear-
ing qualities. It is recommended that liners be honed to a finish of 
10 to 20 micro in.
Cylinder Sizing
A bit contrary to our original promise not to get into mathematics, we 
need to consider a few calculations which will provide general back-
ground on topics such as cooling jackets, lubricant suitability, and so 
forth. Packing and ring material temperature limitations affect per-
missible cylinder and discharge gas temperatures. Also, science tells 
us that exceeding a certain temperature limit in the presence of 
oxygen and a flammable material creates an explosion hazard. This is 
why 375°F (190°C) is considered the maximum allowable tempera-
ture in oil-lubricated air compressors.
In somewhat general (but imprecise “isentropic”) processes of 
compression, the discharge temperature (T2ad) of a compressor may 
be calculated by using Eq. 12.2:

A temperature of 275°F (135°C) is set as an ideal discharge tem-
perature; a maximum of 375°F (190°C) is considered the absolute limit 
of operating temperatures. The design ratio per cylinder (or stage) can 
be determined by using Eq. 12.3 while plugging in the above limits.
An additional limit is presented by the design compression and 
tension load on the piston rod. Limiting rod loads are set by the 

R e c i p r o c a t i n g  C o m p r e s s o r s :  B a c k g r o u n d  a n d  O v e r v i e w 	
155
compressor designer or the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). 
These loads must not be exceeded and, therefore, rod load must be 
checked on each cylinder application. Rod load is defined as follows 
in Eq. 12.4:
	
RL = P2 × AHE - P1 × ACE	
(12.4)
where	
RL = rod load in compression, lb
	
AHE = cylinder area at head end in any one cylinder, in2
	
ACE = cylinder area at crank end, usually ACE = AHE - area rod, in2
	
P2 = discharge pressure, in psia, and P1 = suction pressure, psia
Some manufacturers require lower values on the rod in tension than 
compression. If this is the case, the above limits must be checked by 
reversing the expressions AHE and ACE. However, for most applica-
tions, the compression check will govern.
Compressors below 500 psig, such as plant air compressors, are 
usually sized by considering discharge temperatures. Rod load often 
becomes the limiting factor on applications above these pressures.
Cylinder Cooling
Excessive cooling, also called “overcooling,” of cylinders can cause 
condensation, which then leads to lubrication deficiencies and corro-
sion. For this reason a thermosiphon system as shown in Fig. 12.13 is 
preferred. This means that no forced coolant circulation ought to be 
applied wherever possible. However, high suction temperatures or 
high compression ratios do require coolant circulation.

C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
Thermosiphon cylinder cooling may be specified with a discharge 
temperature limit of about 200°F or 93°C. Thermosiphon cooling con-
sists of filling the jackets with an appropriate liquid such as water or a 
light heat transfer oil and letting the heat radiate from the outer cylin-
der walls. The purpose of filling the jackets is to obtain even heat dis-
tribution throughout the cylinder.
Above 200°F or 93°C, coolant circulation is applied. Raw water 
should not be used because it leaves deposits in the cooling jackets, 
which are extremely difficult to clean out. A closed system is therefore 
frequently specified. This system consists of a reservoir with suitably 
treated water, circulating pumps, and one or more heat exchangers.
Overcooling of the cylinder to a temperature below the dew point 
of the compressed gas must be avoided; overcooling will cause cylin-
der corrosion, lubricant wash-off, or liquid build-up. The presence of 
liquids of any kind is likely to cause “slugging,” the intermittent and 
unpredictable ingestion of a slug of liquid. Therefore, temperature 
controllers must be installed and excess coolant bypassed around the 
cooler or heat exchanger. It is also recommended that a thermostat 
and heater be mounted on the reservoir and the coolant circulated 
when the compressor is stopped or on standby. The purpose, of course, 
is to maintain the cylinders at a temperature above gas dew point.
The coolant is usually 50 percent propylene glycol and water. 
This mixture will prevent freezing, but has a lower specific heat than 
water. Therefore, the manufacturer must be asked to size heat 
exchangers on the basis of lower specific heat, even if the initial cool-
ant is intended to be only water.
Valves
Typical compressor valves are shown in Figs. 12.14 through 12.16. 
Valves are the most critical parts of a reciprocating compressor. They are 
sensitive to both liquids and solids in the gas stream, causing plate and 
spring breakages. When the valve lifts, it can strike the guard and 
rebound to the seat several times in one stroke. This effect is called valve 
flutter and it leads to breakage of valve plates. The problem is predomi-
nantly found with light molecular weight gases such as hydrogen. The 
problem can be mitigated by restricting the lift of the valve plate, thus 
controlling valve velocity. Valve velocity is specified as (Eq. 12.5):

where	V = average velocity in ft/min
	
D = cylinder displacement in cubic ft/min
	
A = total inlet valve area per cylinder, calculated by valve lift 
  times valve opening periphery, times the number of suction 
valves per cylinder in square inches. Valve lift distances dif-
fer with molecular weights and are shown in Table 12.3.

Later, in Chapter 13 (Fig. 13.8, dealing with valve loss factors) it 
will become obvious that lower valve lifts and consequently higher 
valve velocities result in increased valve power losses. However, 
lower valve lifts result in a more reliable valve and designers, own-
ers and operators of reciprocating compressors must therefore, 
find the balance between valve reliability and valve losses.
The typical upstream high speed, high piston speed, short-stroke 
compressor uses high-lift, high-efficiency valves to minimize the reduc-
tion in efficiency resulting from the high piston speed. The valve plate 
material, lift, and springs are specifically selected to fit the application.
While poppet and ring valves are primarily applied in moderate-
to-slow speed compressors, plate valves are predominantly used in 
high-speed machines. Plate valves, at present, appear to be the most

promising candidates for further development as the trend toward 
higher compressor speeds continues.
Manufacturers sometimes have interchangeable suction and dis-
charge valves. This can lead to putting valves in the wrong port, 
which can result in massive valve breakages or broken rod or cylin-
der. It is therefore necessary to specify that valves must not be inter-
changeable. However, certain non-interchange features can be lost or 
broken off, which means that correct valve placement should always 
be checked.
Pistons
Pistons are usually cast iron and are often of hollow construction so 
as to reduce weight. The void space can fill with gas and is an explo-
sive hazard when removing the piston from the rod. One must, 
therefore, specify that an easily removable plug be supplied to vent 
this space before handling. Larger pistons are made of aluminum to 
reduce weight. These pistons have large clearance in the bore to 
allow for thermal expansion, in the order of 20 mils (0.020″)/in of 
diameter. Wear bands or rider rings are often supplied on cast iron 
pistons and are necessary on all aluminum pistons, see Fig. 12.17. 
Bearing loads of pistons and rider rings are based on a unit stress

value and may be calculated using Eq. 12.6. Normal limits are 12 psi 
(0.08 N/mm2) for cast iron, 14 psi (0.1 N/mm2) for bronze, and 22 psi 
(0.15 N/mm2) for one of the very many low-oxidation alloys, known 
as Allen metal.
As long as the maximum average piston speeds remained in 
the 800 to 850 fpm (4.1–4.3 m/s) range, the use of wear bands by 
high-speed, short-stroke compressor manufacturers was not com-
mon. Pushing the maximum piston speed into the 1100 to 1200 fpm 
(5.6–6.1 m/s) range made the use of wear bands a firm requirement 
to avoid rapid wear of the compressor cylinder or liner main bore. 
Wear band–bearing pressure loads in the range from 10 to 12 psi 
(0.07–0.08 N/mm2) actually provide acceptable wear band life in 
the typical upstream application. However, many end users and 
manufacturers have found this wear band life inadequate for 
downstream applications where higher reliability is desired. Here, 
wear band–bearing pressure loads in the 5 to 6 psi (0.035–0.040 N/mm2) 
range are used.

Teflon or Teflon component compression rings are often specified 
and are useful up to 500 psi pressure differential (ΔP). Above these 
loadings, copper-bearing alloy material or babbitt are used for wear 
rings and plain bronze for compression rings. Teflon compression 
rings are often offered with steel expander rings underneath. Still, 
these should be avoided because, as the compression rings wear, the 
expander rings can score the cylinder. Pistons and rings designs are 
available that will hold the compression ring out against the cylinder 
without expander rings.
Piston Rod
The piston rod screws into the crosshead; it must be locked to prevent 
backing off, either by a locknut or a pin. However, there are several 
other methods of fastening the rod, and they should be investigated 
as part of a prepurchase reliability assessment (see our chapter on 
MQA) of a reciprocating compressor. The rod is adjusted in the cross-
head to equalize the end clearance of the piston in the cylinder. End 
clearance is checked by barring over the machine and crushing a 
strip of soft lead. The remaining thickness is then measured; it is com-
monly referred to as the bump clearance.

161
The rod must be hardened where it passes through the packing. 
Some rods are chrome plated, but problems have occurred, especially 
on high-pressure machines with severe heat buildup, causing spider 
web cracks in the chrome which in turn can flake off and destroy the 
packing. Colmonoy plating is advantageous, but often the best 
arrangement is to purchase flame-hardened rods. Hardened rods, 
when worn, can be plated with tungsten carbide, which tends to last 
the life of the machine. High-pressure machines often have the rod 
extended through the piston and out of the cylinder head to balance 
the pressure load on the piston, i.e., the rod load. This arrangement is 
referred to as a tail rod. Tail rods have been known to break off and 
get ejected from the cylinder like a missile. Reliability-focused owner-
purchasers specify that all tail rods be housed in a containment guard 
strong enough to contain the tail rod should a breakage occur.
Packing
Segmental ring packing is a standard component used to seal the space 
between the compressor cylinder and the piston rod, see Fig. 12.18. It 
consists of circular cups, usually cast iron, with their open ends away 
from the cylinder. Each cup contains a ring cut tangentially from ID 
to OD at outside of cup and another ring cut radially from ID to OD

inside the cup. Each segmented ring is held together with a garter 
spring. The flat side of each cup and the flat sides of the rings are 
lapped to a very fine finish. The cups are bolted together in a stack; 
the number of cups depends on the pressure to be sealed. Above 
500 psi, an additional metallic back-up ring is often used to prevent 
Teflon—a favorite elastomer—extruding from the cups.
Rings can be manufactured from many materials, but the most 
common are Teflon, tinned iron, and bronze. Again, our preference is 
for Teflon-based materials whenever practicable.
The stack of packing rings has a vent; oil supply and drain holes 
are drilled in the packing case at appropriate locations. The rings 
must be correctly aligned each time the packing case is opened.
Compressor manufacturers supply a distance piece between the 
cylinder and the crankcase for access to the packing. This is usually 
sufficient for a three or four cup packing set. In process applications, 
however, especially above 2000 psi or 140 bar, packing sets can amount 
to 8 or even 18 cups. Extra long-distance pieces will be needed in order 
that sufficient space is available to open the cups and change the pack-
ing rings. If any doubt exists, the extra long-distance piece should be 
specified at original purchase; the additional or incremental cost is 
minor. It is almost impossible to change or upgrade to larger packing 
sets after the machine is built.
What We Have Learned
Small single-acting reciprocating compressors differ from process 
reciprocating machines.
Different machine categories operate at different piston speeds. 
Machines with higher piston speeds require more maintenance and 
have lower availability than slower speed machines.
Compressor frame lubrication and cylinder lubrication are different 
sources or circuits. Each usually merits a different lube type in reliability-
focused plants.
Developing a sound working relationship with competent, depend-
able suppliers and service contractors is important.

CHAPTER 13
Compressor 
Operation and 
Capacity Control
Starting Reciprocating Compressors
The work of compression is actually done in less than 180° of each 
rotation. Therefore, rotating inertia must be built into the power train 
to obtain a uniform power draw from the prime mover. The stored 
energy must be put into the system before compression starts; other-
wise the prime mover will be overloaded.
The compressor is unloaded to start, either by suction valve unload-
ing or through a valve bypass from discharge back to suction.
A popular means of suction valve unloading consists of fingers 
which hold open the suction valve plates. Another unloader style con-
sists of a plug covering a hole in the center of the suction valve. Either 
may be actuated by a pneumatic or electrical plunger, or by a hand 
wheel mounted on a screw spindle.
Finger-style suction valve lifters are normally used in air compres-
sors. Suction valve plugs are much preferred for process compressors. 
Finger-type suction valve lifters put point loads on valve plates when 
actuated, causing a stress concentration. Plug valves offer a port area 
which may be less than the valve area, thus causing some throttling. 
Still, they require fewer maintenance interventions than finger-type 
valve lifters in corrosive services.
A valved bypass is normally provided for starting single-stage 
compressors. This arrangement would not be suitable for multistage 
machines since their first stage would load up due to throttling in 
the smaller stages that follow. Actuators are normal for multistage 
compressors but they must be timed to operate in unison such that 
one stage will not carry the entire load at start-up.

Performance Control and Throughput Adjustment
Performance and throughput control can be achieved by unloaders. 
Actually, compressor unloaders are commonly used for two primary 
purposes:
· Unloading the compressor cylinders during compressor start-
up. This helps minimize the necessary starting torque and 
thus reduces the size and cost of the compressor driver.
· Allowing reciprocating compressor to meet a variety of different 
gas flow conditions through the use of unloaded compressor 
cylinder ends and/or clearance pockets.
In order to increase cylinder end clearance and thus decrease 
capacity, valved pockets (Fig. 13.1) can be added to the cylinder vol-
ume. They are referred to as variable volume clearance pocket (VVCP) 
unloaders and are used to open and close a clearance volume (a 
“pocket”) inside the compressor cylinder. Opening a clearance pocket 
adds clearance volume to the compressor cylinder, decreasing com-
pression efficiency and resulting in decreased gas flow. Use of clear-
ance pockets can help obtain intermediate capacity load steps not 
achievable by the sole use of cylinder end unloading.

Variable volume clearance pocket unloaders present the main 
means of capacity control on upstream high-speed compressors. In 
upstream applications, VVCPs are placed in the cylinder end cover, or 
on the side of a cylinder, and the valves to open them can be operated 
by a hand wheel or actuator. On compression ratios below 2, the vol-
ume of the pockets becomes too large to be effective, and only partial 
reduction of cylinder end capacity control is accomplished by VVCPs. 
On ratios below 1.5, the volume of an effective pocket becomes 
prohibitive and pocket control is rarely used. Variable volume clear-
ance pockets can thus give infinite modulation over the range of 
the pocket. However, the method is considered cumbersome for 
downstream process operations, and is therefore, not very often used 
except in special cases where fine control is mandatory.
Several other styles of unloaders are primarily used on process 
gas compressors. They include:
The port unloader. A port unloader is an unloader located in the 
compressor cylinder such that it can be used to open and close a 
dedicated “port.” This port connects the cylinder bore with the 
internal cylinder gas passage. Opening the port will allow gas to 
flow freely into and out of the cylinder. This will then effectively 
unload the cylinder end in which the port unloader is located. 
Port unloaders are commonly used in cylinders where there is 
sufficient space for an unloader port in addition to the required 
number of compressor valves.
A plug unloader. Shown in Fig. 13.2, a plug unloader is used in con-
junction with a partial inlet compressor valve. When the unloader 
is “loaded,” it seals off the open hole in the center of the compressor

valve and the valve then operates normally. When the hole in the 
center of the valve is opened or “unloaded,” gas can pass freely 
into and out of the cylinder, unloading the cylinder end in which 
the unloader is located. Plug unloaders are commonly used where 
there is insufficient space for a port unloader, but where proper 
unloading can be achieved through partial compressor valves.
A finger unloader. A finger unloader uses “fingers,” as shown in 
Fig. 13.3, to depress the inlet compressor valve elements and to

hold them open. Doing so allows the gas in the compressor cylin-
der to pass freely into and out of the compressor cylinder. Finger 
unloaders are commonly applied in situations where, because of 
insufficient unloading area, port and plug type unloaders cannot 
be applied.
A suction valve lifter. Suction valve lifters or plugs are often used 
in air process gas services. They unload a specific end of a cylin-
der completely. Control is, therefore, in steps. On a single double-
acting cylinder, this is called three-step control, giving capacities 
of 0, 50, and 100 percent of rating. Suction valve unloading can be 
combined with clearance pockets to obtain five-step unloading. 
Five-step unloading is accomplished by having a clearance pocket 
in one end of the cylinder to reduce capacity by 25 percent. This 
would result in a capacity arrangement of capacities of 0, 25, 50, 
75, or 100 percent of rating.
Infinite modulation can also be obtained by a device which times 
the closing of the suction valve partway down the compression stroke. 
As of 2012, this is a promising but somewhat expensive electronic con-
trol offered by at least one major compressor valve manufacturing 
company.
Suction pressure control is often recommended where temperature 
rise and rod load limits allow it. The performance of the specific 
machine must be checked before applying this method. An important 
detail to note is that a compressor operating at constant discharge 
pressure with variable suction pressure will reach its peak horse-
power approximately at a compression ratio of 2.2. Therefore, at or 
near this ratio, variable capacity at relatively constant horsepower 
can be obtained. On some applications, where variable suction pres-
sures are built into the application, clearance pockets are applied to 
keep the peak load below the driver horsepower.
Multiple Services
The “running gear,” composed of reciprocating compressor frame, 
crankshaft, gear (occasionally used for speed reduction), and driver 
represents the greater part of the cost of these machines. The cost of 
the cylinder and piston is relatively small. For this reason, the com-
bination of more than one service on a given frame can result in 
substantial savings in the total cost of compression facilities. A typi-
cal example would be the placement of feed and recycle gas cylin-
ders on one common frame for a hydrofiner unit in a petroleum 
refinery. In this instance, the saving in cost for compressor and 
driver would be about 40 percent compared to the cost of two sepa-
rate machines.

Calculations
The purpose of showing calculations in our text is to help understand 
and troubleshoot reciprocating compressor problems. The math just 
identifies how some relationships are derived. Usually, we want to:
	
1.	 Determine the approximate power requirement to compress 
and move a certain volume of gas from some intake conditions 
at a given discharge pressure.
	
2.	 Ascertain the capacity of an existing compressor installation 
under field suction and discharge pressure conditions.
Solving compressor problems using the ideal gas laws can be 
reduced to a relatively simple sequence of applying a few fundamen-
tal formulas and obtaining values from simple curves. In order to help 
in the understanding of these terms and equations, the first portion of 
this section covers some basic thermodynamics.
Following the sequence of events, as they happen in a cylinder, is 
probably the best way to develop an understanding of the terms that 
are likely encountered in most compressor problems. We are helped 
by referring to Fig. 13.4, where the typical pressure–volume relation-
ship is superimposed on a piston with a stroke length of “s.”

Position 1: This is the start of the compression stroke. The cylinder 
has a full charge of gas at suction pressure. As the piston moves 
toward Position 2, the gas is compressed along line 1-2.
Position 2: At this point, the pressure in the cylinder has become 
greater than the pressure in the discharge line. This now causes 
the discharge valve to open and allows the original charge of gas, 
which is now at discharge pressure, to be moved into the discharge 
line.
Position 3: Here, the piston has completed its discharge stroke. 
As soon as it starts its return stroke, the pressure in the cylinder 
drops, which closes the discharge valve. Notice the volume of gas 
that is trapped between the end of the piston and the end of the 
cylinder. This is known as the clearance volume. This volume of 
gas has to expand along line 3-4 as the piston moves back toward 
Position 4.
Position 4: At this point, the pressure within the cylinder has 
dropped below the suction pressure, causing the suction valve to 
open. This allows a new charge of gas to be taken into the cylinder 
as the piston returns to Point 1, the start of the compression stroke.
With the basic mechanics of the compressor in mind, it becomes 
easy to visualize and understand most of the basic definitions that 
will be offered here.
Piston Displacement
Piston displacement (PD) is the actual volume displaced by the piston 
as it travels the length of its stroke, from Position 1, bottom dead 
center (BDC), to Position 3, top dead center (TDC). Piston displace-
ment is normally expressed as the volume displaced per minute or 
cubic feet per minute (CFM). In the case of the double-acting cylinder, 
the displacement of the crank end of the cylinder is also included. 
The crank end displacement is, of course, less than the head end dis-
placement by the amount that the piston rod displaced. For a single 
acting cylinder, Eq. 13.1 expresses the piston displacement PD:

Compression Ratio
P2/P1 is the ratio of the discharge pressure to the suction pressure 
with both pressure values expressed as absolute units. In the P–V dia-
gram of Fig. 13.4, line 2-3 is at discharge pressure, and line 4-1 is at 
suction pressure.
Note that the compression ratio is not controlled by the compres-
sor, but by the system conditions on the compression suction and dis-
charge. During compression, the cylinder pressure will rise until it is 
high enough to force the gas through the discharge valves and into 
the system. During expansion, the cylinder pressure will fall until the 
system can force gas into the cylinder and maintain the pressure. 
Naturally, the compression ratios cannot be infinite. As the compres-
sion ratio is increased, volumetric efficiency will decrease until no 
more gas is moved. If the compression ratio is increased at constant 
suction pressure, the piston rod loadings will increase and the over-
loaded piston rod may fail. Further, the cylinder cooling provided 
may not be adequate for the discharge temperature associated with 
higher compression ratios. Nevertheless, the machine will always 
attempt to meet the system compression ratios.
On multistage compressors, the actual compression ratios on 
each stage are self-determining because all the gas from the low pres-
sure cylinders must also pass through the higher pressure cylinders. 
The compression ratio on each stage will not change in proportion to 
the system pressure ratio, but it can change appreciably if the effi-
ciency of any of the stages undergoes change. Efficiency will decay if 
there is piston ring blow-by or valve failure. Perhaps the most elusive 
cause of efficiency decay is erosion and blow-by at the valve seat. 
Although the seating surface is thought to be sealed by a gasket, such 
erosion is not usually suspected by maintenance personnel.
Clearance
Percent clearance is used to calculate the volumetric efficiency of a cyl-
inder and is the ratio of clearance volume to piston displacement, 
expressed as a percentage, per Eq. 13.4:

(13.4)
Clearance volume is the volume left in the cylinder end at Position 3 
of the stroke shown in Fig. 13.4, including the valves and valve ports. 

C o m p r e s s o r  O p e r a t i o n  a n d  C a p a c i t y  C o n t r o l 	
171
Clearance volume is the region in each end of a cylinder that is not 
swept by the piston movement. Generally, large cylinders are affected 
more by the clearance in the gap between piston and cylinder head. In 
contrast, small cylinders are affected more by clearance in and under 
the valves. Clearance percentage varies between each end of the cylin-
der and should be considered separately in calculations. It can usually 
be averaged. Percent clearance is vital information for reciprocating 
compressor calculations and therefore should be specified as required 
nameplate information on all compressor purchases. For estimating 
purposes and if clearance is unknown, assuming a 15 percent clearance 
will yield reasonable accuracy.
Volumetric Efficiency
Volumetric efficiency (EVS) referred to suction conditions is the ratio of 
actual gas drawn into the cylinder to the piston displacement, 
expressed in percent. Referring again to the diagram in Fig. 13.4, vol-
umetric efficiency represents the distance 4 to 1, divided by the stroke.

These are leakage across the valves, across the piston rings, and 
through the packing. There is also the heating effect on the incoming 
gas from the residual heat in the cylinder. Because, in addition, the 
compressibility of the gas comes into play, a better formula has been 
developed and is shown in Eq. 13.6.

Basic Equations
Reciprocating compressor calculations are performed by stage. There-
fore, the number of stages must be determined first. The number is 
based on limiting temperature and rod load, as was discussed earlier. 
In addition, horsepower savings can be realized by using the same 
ratio for each stage. This ratio can be calculated by Eq. 13.8:

Generally speaking, in process work, the ratio per stage seldom

This equation has been modified and presented as a curve, 
making it easier to visualize the various relationships and influences. 
Million cubic feet per day at 14.6 psia and suction temperature are 
displayed and presented in Fig. 13.7. The horsepower is theoretical 
and must be modified by taking compressibility, valve efficiency, and 
mechanical efficiency into account.
Valve efficiency allows for pressure drop across the valves, which 
results in higher discharge and lower suction pressures within the 
cylinder, than is supplied to the compressor. This may be found from 
Figs. 13.8 and 13.9; again, it shows how changing a parameter influ-
ences the results.

What We Have Learned
· Unloaders are used for compressor start-up and for capacity 
control.
· There are several unloader styles and each has its advantages 
and disadvantages.
· Multiple services are feasible and should be considered in 
process applications. They can represent major cost savings.
· Volumetric efficiency is an important property built into a 
compressor cylinder. It should influence compressor selection.

CHAPTER 14
Reciprocating 
Compressor 
Maintenance
A 
few pages are needed to guide owners and operators of recip-
rocating compressors in setting up maintenance and trouble 
 shooting procedures for their machines. Our recommenda-
tions here are not intended to replace the stipulations of the original 
equipment manufacturer (OEM) for any machine. Instead, they should 
serve as general guidelines to assist in failure prevention and problem 
solution.
Recent investigations showed maintenance costs of around US$ 
48.00 per horsepower per year for reciprocating compression equip-
ment as opposed to some US$ 10.00 per horsepower per year for large 
turbocompressors. Despite the application of advanced technologies 
in the development and manufacture of wearing parts, such as valves, 
piston rings, and packing, these components continue to be the main 
causes of reciprocating compressor failures and unscheduled outages. 
Figure 14.1 shows the most frequently failing reciprocating compres-
sor components.
Compressor Cylinder
Rod Load
Major breakages such as broken rods, crossheads, pin bushings, and 
frame cracks are caused more often by exceeding maximum rod load 
than any other cause.
Massive failures become more likely on multistage machines and 
cylinders with higher suction pressures; these failures can occur with 
frightening suddenness. Specific causes are failure of interstage relief 
valves or shutdown switches, valve breakage, and unequal loading. 
These malfunctions can relate to opening clearance pockets or valve

lifters out of sequence and changing process conditions such as 
lowering suction pressure without checking if the resulting loads 
remain within design range.
A monitoring curve should be drawn for each cylinder where 
excessive rod loads could occur. The boundaries of the curve(s) will 
be discharge pressure relative to suction pressure. Two straight-line 
curves may be obtained from the following two equations:

where	
P1 = suction pressure in psi
	
P2 = discharge pressure in psi
	
A = cylinder area in in2
	
a = rod area in in2
	
CRL = permissible compression rod load in lb
	
TRL = permissible tension rod load in lb
By substituting two reasonable values for P1 in each equation, two 
corresponding points are calculated for P2. A straight line is drawn 
joining these two points. The lower of the two lines will govern. 
When only one rod load is given, the compression rod load formula 
should be used.
In essence, for every discharge pressure there exists a corre-
sponding limiting suction pressure. Any particular possible pressure 
should be checked on such a curve; it will look similar to Fig. 14.2. 
The combination of suction and discharge pressures allowed in a 
particular compressor must fall below the lower of the two lines.
Some operators prefer this curve be made into table form as shown 
below. Extracting the curve above onto a table is a simple matter. See 
Table 14.1.

Piston and Liner Care
Cooling Issues
Overcooling of cylinders can cause vapor condensation and can rap-
idly lead to loss of lubrication and corrosion. Care should be taken that 
the circulating coolant is above the dew point of the gas being com-
pressed. Air compressors are the most prominent offenders because 
usually the cylinder cooling jackets are piped in series after the inter-
cooler. The flow rate through the jackets should be reduced such that 
the coolant is warm to the touch at outlet, or about 110°F (43°C).
Temperature Issues
Cylinder discharge temperatures are the most sensitive readings that 
can be observed on a compressor. Any cylinder operating at constant

pressures that shows a rise-over-baseline of 25°F (14°C) or more in 
discharge temperature is cause for concern. The machine should be 
shut down immediately and checked for broken valves, piston ring 
failures, and/or liner scoring.
Rider Rings
Pistons with rider rings or wear bands must be checked for rider ring 
(also called rider band) wear. There are two types of rider rings, fixed 
and floating. With fixed rider rings, the piston must be rotated 90° 
every so often to equalize wear. With floating riders, they should 
rotate on the piston on their own and therefore equalize wear. In 
either instance, measuring compressor rod run-out with a dial indica-
tor at the cylinder gland is productive. While barring over, deviation 
measurements will indicate whether or not rider bands should be 
rotated or replaced. The clearance under the piston should be mea-
sured on installation and compressor rod run-out readings recorded. 
When, with time, the rod drop change adds + 0.005″ (0.13 mm) to this 
clearance, rider or wear rings should be rotated or renewed. Rod 
drop (rod sag) readings can be taken with the compressor operating; 
this monitoring method is simpler than using feeler gages under the 
piston. Taken quarterly and plotted on a time line, rod drop will indi-
cate replacement time under normal wear as well as unusual wear 
conditions. Information about rod drop monitoring procedures may 
also be found in API Standard 618, 4th edition, June 1995, Appendix C. 
Of course, more recent editions of this API standard must be consid-
ered whenever available.
Rod Drop Detection
While the above describes traditional checks of piston ring wear, per-
manently installed rod-drop devices have gained widespread accep-
tance. These are composed of a proximity probe which, through the 
use of an eddy current and a calibrated gap, monitors continuously 
any change in piston rod up-down travel. This travel is likely to occur 
as a result of packing or ring wear and/or rod deflection due to over-
load. Rod drop recording can result in increased machine availability 
and improved maintenance scheduling.
Pistons
Most pistons today (2012) are using Teflon or composition type com-
pression rings. Compositions are predominantly high-performance 
polymers (HPPs). The manufacturer’s experience with proposed 
compression ring materials in a particular gas service must be checked 
before purchase.
Frequently, compression rings are forced out against the liner by 
steel expander rings. If the compression rings should become worn 
and break up, the expander ring can expand out and damage the 
liner which will create a bad cylinder score in a very short period. 

R e c i p r o c a t i n g  C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e 	
183
Scheduled inspection of this type of compression rings through a 
valve port is essential. This can be done on some types of compressor 
cylinders by backing the rod off from the crosshead, moving the pis-
ton rings under the valve port, and measuring the end gap clearance 
of the rings. It is a good rule-of-thumb not to install piston ring 
expanders or wave springs under compressor piston rings that are in 
excess of 10 in (10″) (254 mm) in diameter.
Additionally, the authors would like to stress the need for 
running-in newly installed wear components such as the rings men-
tioned above. There is a large body of evidence acknowledging a 
temperature increase during the initial hours of unloaded operation. 
During this time, thermoplastics release their lubricant compounds 
by coating the mating part as mentioned before. A 4 to 6 hour run-in 
is appropriate.
Piston Rings
Metallic compression rings, if they must be still used, will experience 
wear resulting in sharp edges which can cut into the liner. These 
edges or corners should be chamfered with a file when it is found 
necessary to relieve the scoring effect.
Liner Issues
It has been observed that if scoring of the liner for any cause is taking 
place, the metal very quickly finds its way into the packing and 
flushes out of the packing drain. If any discoloration of the oil or sign 
of metal particles takes place, the machine should be shut down and 
the liner checked for scoring through valve ports on each end of the 
cylinder. Replace the liner or implement the honing procedure 
described in Table 14.2.
The inspection of the packing drain oil need only consist of put-
ting a small piece of tissue paper under the opened drain and exam-
ining the drop of oil under a light.
Many compressors have been converted to minimum lubrication 
(“minilube”) or nonlube construction. Piston rider rings, also called 
wear bands, must be applied for this conversion. Occasionally, cast 
iron pistons have been too heavy for liners. Wear patterns here pres-
ent themselves as holes or large pits in the piston. Rider rings can 
cure this problem. When rider rings are applied, check that the weight 
of piston divided by the projected area of rider ring is less than 8 psi 
(0.06 N/mm2) for minilube and 5 psi (0.03 N/mm2) for nonlube 
applications.
Cylinder Lubrication
Lubrication serves several purposes. It acts as a cooling agent, carrying 
away heat. It also washes away particulate matter and helps sealing. It 
prevents corrosion. However, its most important function is to reduce 
friction.1

184	
C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
Step 1: After the piston has been removed from the cylinder, install a 
container or some form of a catcher below the cylinder opening to prevent 
grindings from entering the working parts of compressor or crankcase.
Step 2: Thoroughly wash out cylinder with kerosene or an approved brand 
of commercial cleaning fluid; remove all deposits of carbon and oil, then dry 
with a clean linen rag.
Step 3: Determine the condition of cylinder to be honed. If the cylinder has 
been scored to depths of over 0.005″ (0.13 mm ), a coarse stone “number 
136” should be used to remove and dress down the extra build-up on the 
cylinder walls, leaving a depth of 0.002″ ( 0.05 mm) to be finished with 
stone “number 236.” If there is no scoring present or scoring is less than 
0.002" (0.05 mm), proceed to the deglazing step, Step no. 4.
Step 4: Deglazing—Use stone no. 236 or another of the 200 series; then 
follow the same procedure as in step no. 6.
  All stones must be used dry on cast iron cylinders. Stones and guide 
blocks must be kept together and used as sets; never use the same pair of 
guide blocks with different sets of stones.
  Hone driving motor. For best results it is recommended that a slow speed 
(250–400 RPM) air drill be used. The drill must have right-hand rotation and 
have a 3/8″ (9.5 mm) or larger chuck size.
Step 5: Insert and expand stones and guides firmly against cylinder walls 
by turning the winged collar on the hone clockwise. During this adjustment, 
stones should not extend more than ½″ (13 mm) out of the cylinder.
Step 6: Push the stone to the bottom of the cylinder; allow the stones to 
go through the lower end of the bore ½″ to 1″ (13–26 mm). Start stroking 
at the bottom of the cylinder using short strokes in order to concentrate 
honing in the smallest and important section of the cylinder. Gradually 
lengthen stroke as metal is removed and stones contact higher on the 
cylinder walls, stroke all the way to the top of the cylinder, always bearing in 
mind to maintain a constant steady stroke of about 30 cycles per minute. 
An excellent indication of cylinder condition is speed of the drill. 
  A reduction in drill speed, during honing, indicates a smaller diameter. 
Localize stroking at such sections until drill speed is constant over at least 
75 percent of the cylinder length.
Step 7: Remove stone and check for cylinder appearance after free 
stroking, include no binding, for approximately 1 minute. The finished 
cylinder should indicate a diamond-shaped hatch pattern of approximately 
25 to 30 min (0.635 –0.762 mm) Ra* for the ideal seating of bronze piston 
rings, for instance. For Teflon rings, finish should be 16 to 20 min. 
(0.41–0.51 mm) Ra. 
  Do not over-hone. If finish is too fine, ring wear will be excessive. Use 
roughness comparators to check the finish.

Compressor lubrication oil must meet the following minimum 
requirements:*
	
1.	 Good wetting ability.
	
2.	 High film strength.
	
3.	 Good chemical stability.
	
4.	 Clean and well refined.
	
5.	 Oxidation and corrosion inhibitors not required, but may be 
beneficial.
	
6.	 Pour point must be equal to gas suction temperature plus 
15°F to 20°F (7°C–10°C).
	
7.	 Good resistance to carbon deposits and sludge formation. If 
any carbon is formed, if should be the soft, loose, and flaky 
type.
	
8.	 Minimum flash point of 400°F (200°C).
	
9.	 For required viscosities follow Table 14.3.
Few mineral oils meet all of these requirements and expertly 
formulated synthetic lubes are best. As is so often the case, only a 
thorough experience check will give assurance of selecting the opti-
mum cylinder lubricant. The cheapest lube is almost never the best 
from a cost-of-ownership point of view. Be sure to read our comment 
on page 152, taking issue with the “one-oil-fits-all” approach on 
critical process compression equipment. Protecting your assets is 
worth far more than the incremental cost of superior lubricants over 
the “conventional wisdom oil.”
There is general agreement that determining the correct amount 
of proper lubrication for cylinder and packing is not an exact science.

C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
The right amount of lubrication is dependent on the gas pressure, its 
variability, oil viscosity, and temperature. In order to determine required 
lube oil quantities considering these factors and cylinder sizes, compres-
sor OEMs have developed formulas that provide an average lubrication 
usage for the normal application. Not only must the proper lubrication 
be applied in the proper amount, it must get to the proper place at the 
proper time. The little understood, much abused lubrication distribution, 
system shown in Fig. 14.3, is responsible for this task.
The distribution block type lubrication system in Fig. 14.3 uses 
positive displacement to meter the amount of oil fed forward to 
lubricate compressor cylinders and packing. Since the system oper-
ates on a proportional basis, a single adjustment at the force feed 
lubricator pump increases or decreases the flow proportional to 
every lubrication point served. The system consists of a pump, sized 
to provide enough lubrication and pressure to overcome the back 
pressure from the pressures inside the cylinder, and a series of 
valves, divider, or distribution blocks, to get the lubrication to the 
right locations. Hydraulically balanced pistons inside the blocks 
divide the oil into accurately metered amounts for each lubrication

point served. Sound selection and proper make-up of the distribu-
tion block allows
	
1.	 Accurately measured “shot” sizes, and 
	
2.	 Precise proportioning to meet different or equal oil requirements.
A typical divider block, Fig. 14.4, provides a certain volume of 
lubricant with each stroke. For instance, a divider block of a given 
size delivers 0.20 in3 (3.28 cm3) per lubricator pump stroke. The 
compressor’s per cylinder lubricant requirement value is met by 
making adjustments to the lubricator pump RPM, and total lubrica-
tion required allow to size a system that provides the proper amount 
of lubrication.
Because of the positive, metered operation, central warning equip-
ment can sense trouble anywhere in the system. Safety equipment 
includes pin fault indicators in each outlet from the distribution block, 
a pneumatic or electric shutdown switch in the event of lubricant flow 
failures, and a rupture disc in the lubricator collector manifold.
It stands to reason that divider blocks have a finite life. Pumps 
can be adjusted to provide a minimum and a maximum amount of 
lubrication. If the lubrication system is sized for the mid-to-low range 
and the operator turns up the pump rate, more than the required 
amount of oil goes into the cylinder. When a divider block wears out

it starts to leak. This leaking block can provide more lubrication than 
needed, or the oil may bypass the cylinder and not get to its intended 
destination.
Frequently, when a compressor is moved from one location to 
another, the pressures and volumes are different. It is possible that 
the cylinders were changed to meet the new conditions. However, 
quite often, the same divider block setup may end up being reused. 
Verify that it is still the right size for the new cylinder.
Lubricating oil consumption in pints per 24 hours is the figure on 
which cylinder lubrication is based. Use the number of drops viewed 
in a sight feed or similar observation port merely as a guide to obtain 
a balance between cylinder feeds. Recognize also that certain com-
pressors may not be operating at their maximum RPM when setting 
the lubricator feeds by drops.

Sight feed lubricators are often used; they facilitate checking the 
lubricant delivery rate. Manufacturers’ specifications, for required 
lube oil quantities vary and are often contained in their operating and 
maintenance manuals. One high-speed, high average piston speed 
compressor OEM quotes a quantity of 0.2 pints/d/in of cylinder 
bore as being equivalent to one drop per minute per inch of bore for 
very heavy oils. The same OEM recommends quantities up to two 
drops per minute per inch of bore for very light oils.
To ensure that adequate lubrication is being achieved, periodic 
visual inspections of the cylinder bore and piston rod are recom-
mended. Initial settings and adjustments to the feed rate should also 
be accomplished on a 24-hour basis because drop sizes vary with the 
viscosity of the oil.
It is interesting to note that even the manufacturers of Teflon are 
tying their product to a cylinder lubrication issue. They advise that 
*Generally accepted: 10,000 to 14,500 drops per pint (~473 cm3) depending on 
viscosity.

their product is only truly self-lubricating when it is rubbing on 
Teflon. This means that metal coming into rubbing contact with 
Teflon must pick up enough of this polymer to form a very thin coat-
ing over the metal surface. In fact, rapid wear of Teflon will occur 
until this coating is formed and new or rehoned liners will experience 
accelerated initial wear on the replacement Teflon rings. This wear is 
self-limiting and will be followed by normal rates of wear. It is espe-
cially noticeable on nonlubricated (Teflon-equipped) reciprocating 
compressors.
Therefore, new or rehoned cylinders should be taken out of ser-
vice and the rings measured at frequent intervals until the first set of 
rings indicate their wear-out time.
Ring Thickness
Plotting ring thickness on a time graph should show a rapidly 
decreasing rate of wear and the life limit can be predicted. This plot 
should be followed on all new liners. Honing newly bored liners with 
Teflon blocks will reduce this rapid wear somewhat if done after pre-
servative grease is removed.
Dirt
Impurities or contaminants, usually present in the form of dust and 
liquid carryover, are the enemy of compressor cylinders. Lubrication 
in the cylinders picks up the dust and makes an abrasive sludge 
which damages liners, rods, valves, rings, and packing. Nonlube 
machines transport dust easier with less wear, but in either case dirt 
should be prevented. Liquids wash the lubrication off cylinder liners 
and piston rods and cause scoring; small amounts of liquid cause 
minor valve abrasion. Large slugs of liquid can instantly destroy 
valves. Liquids on valve seats can flash and cut the metal during 
normal operation. While it can drastically shorten valve life, it can 
also cause cavitation-erosion on the seat. Damaged valve seats invite 
blow-by and valve overheating.
Suction Scrubbers
Several types of suction filters and liquid disengagement vessels have 
been tried with varying degrees of success. The best type found so far 
is the two-compartment type with filter cores for solids removal and 
liquids drop-out in the first compartment. Demister-mesh or crinkled 
wire mesh (CWM) is accommodated in the second compartment. As 
mentioned in an earlier chapter, every attempt should be made to 
obtain the best-possible filter, knock-out drum, or filter-coalescer just 
upstream of the compressor suction nozzle. Good manufacturers and 
owner-purchasers recognize that liquid disengagement will occur 
orders of magnitude more effectively at low gas velocities. For a given 
volume of throughput, a larger contact area will keep gas velocities 
down. Larger area of contact mean large vessel, which is more money 

190

up front. But it will lower the cost of ownership because there is greater 
availability and fewer catastrophic downtime events with well-designed, 
larger vessels.
Beware of piping inserted between any such disengagement 
vessel and the compressor suction nozzle. If the gas is at or near 
saturation conditions, cooling this exposed suction piping will cause 
vapors to condense and enter the compressor. Think of the eventuality 
of rainwater hitting it. Will condensation then occur?
There is a continuing effort by compressor knockout filter sup-
plier to improve their products. Regular cleanout of the filter must be 
scheduled.
Packing Care
Packing Rings
As mentioned in a previous chapter, segmental ring packing is a stan-
dard component used to seal the space between the compressor cylin-
der and the piston rod. Teflon is used whenever practicable. Packing 
rings rub on the hardened area of the piston rod and heat is built up, 
which is additive to the compression heat in the cylinder. Keeping the 
packing and rod cool is therefore, a first requirement for good care.
Packing cases (or glands) for higher compression ratios or high gas 
temperatures often have cooling passages. This is one area where the 
coolest water available is best. Since the segments are stacked, care must 
be taken to line up and seal the cooling passages. In addition to cooling, 
most packing is lubricated by injection of oil into the innermost cup and 
sometimes again in other cups toward the outside, depending on the 
number of cups in the packing gland. A drain and vent is also located in 
or near the last cup and sometimes on deeper cups. Each vent and drain 
line is separately piped out of the gland. These drains give an excellent 
indication, not only of the condition of the packing, but also of the 
cylinder itself. The vents should be regularly sampled for condition of 
the oil drain and blow-by; see Fig. 14.5 later.
Frequently, packing vents are instrumented for flow indication, 
and a Rotameter or similar device can be used as a means of monitor-
ing machinery health. Observing oil drained from the sample valve, 
Fig. 14.5, is important. If it has turned dark or starts containing par-
ticles, scoring of the liner is probably in progress. Oil that is emulsi-
fied and yellowish indicates that the packing is not seated well or 
may be damaged. Corrective action should be taken as soon as these 
defects are noticed. The same indicators are present in nonlube ser-
vice but are much more difficult to see. Still—if in doubt, it is better to 
find and remedy a problem early rather than wait for a major failure.
To say that human lives are at stake is an understatement.
Dirt carryover will foul the packing cups. If vents and drains 
show darkened oil, the rod will usually exhibit scratching: Clean the 
packing as soon as possible. The, usually combined, vent and drain

line is the best indicator of cylinder and packing scoring. Keeping a 
regular watch on it and taking preventive action without delay can 
keep the machine in operation for long periods. Daily taking a few 
drops of oil from the packing vent will serve as a relatively quick 
indicator of an approaching need to shut down the compressor.
Breaking-in Procedure
Breaking in new rod packing, particularly in older rods, is a tedious 
task. The most important task is to keep the rod cool. Set oil rate about 
three times of normal levels but not at full flow since over-lubrication 
for break-in will cause the cups to fill and have a hydraulic pressur-
ization effect on the packing. Also, carbon and sludge can be formed 
as oil overheats. Keep the inspection covers off the distance piece and 
use only enough oil to see a reasonable drip from the drains. Add oil 
to the rod in the distance piece by hand to keep it cool. For nonlube 
service with Teflon packing, apply a reasonably small amount of 
water from an oil can to keep the rod wet and cooled. The packing 
should seat in about 2 hours and thereafter give acceptable blow-by.
Friction is the major cause of heat buildup in a packing case. 
Under normal circumstances, lubrication on a piston rod as it moves 
through the packing should be evenly applied; it should result in an 
oil film thickness of about 0.002 in (51 mm). Such a lubricating film 
lowers the friction factor and extends ring wear and life. In many 
cases Eqs. 14.3 to 14.6 are also used to determine lubrication require-
ments for the piston rod and packing by treating it as a separate

cylinder. However, as average piston speeds increase, over-lubrication 
will become a problem.
As a preventive maintenance (PM) check, experienced mainte-
nance technicians sometimes use cigarette paper to determine if there 
was enough or too much lubrication. The same approach is described 
in several OEM service manuals. Essentially, the technique uses two 
sheets of paper to wipe down the cylinder bore or rod. To signal 
acceptable lubrication, the first sheet should be oily and the second 
one should be dry.
Another experienced authority believes a single sheet of cigarette 
paper can be used as an indicator. Over-lubrication is certain if, after 
patting the paper into the cylinder walls and pulling it out, the oil not 
only covers the entire paper but droplets drip from it. Finding only 
isolated or discontinuous spots of oil on the paper would mean insuf-
ficient lubrication. We believe either method is reasonable.
Over-lubrication will prevent the packing from sealing or cause 
it to fail within a short period of time after startup. Smaller, high 
average-piston-speed compressors are more susceptible to over-
lubrication than larger, slower compressors. There are two different 
scenarios: One involves too much lubrication in the packing case 
and on the rod when installing new packing. The other is a result of 
continuing to add too much lubrication through the lubrication 
system until it stops the packing from functioning. One should sus-
pect over-lubrication when the packing will not seat on start-up. 
While there are other factors that can contribute to a failure to seat, 
over-lubrication is by far the most prevalent.
If the maintenance technician replaces the rings with another 
set, he or she should examine the inner bore for bad rings. If over-
lubrication was the reason for their failure to seat, most likely they 
will show no or very little wear marks from rubbing on the rod. This 
is because the rings never touched the rod. They were probably riding 
on top of the thick oil film; by not actually touching the rod surface, 
the rings failed to perform their intended sealing function.
In applications where the rings have sealed initially but fail after a 
week or two, the small diametral clearance of ~0.004 in (~0.1 mm) 
provided for the rings to move, adjust, and distribute the loads evenly. 
The rings are thought to have later filled with excessive amounts of oil 
and, often, with other liquids. This somehow rendered the rings 
unable to move; they then overheated, partially melted, and failed. 
When removed for examination, these rings are often found saturated 
with oil and stuck together, which is why the above explanation seems 
quite plausible.
In the first case, where rings will not seat, consider that carbon-
filled Teflon rings do not require much lubrication. They were origi-
nally designed to run in nonlube applications. Thousands of these 
rings run in nonlubricated applications in the petrochemical industry.

193
Their useful operating life may not always match that of high-
performance polymers, but they work well. Unless there is a lot  
of washing, as mentioned before, a very thin film of lubrication is 
sufficient.
When packing will not seat on start-up, wiping the rod down 
with a rag often helps. Rotate the crank shaft so the rod travels in and 
out of the packing case a couple of times and wipe it each time. This 
will help remove the excess lubrication from the rod and case.
In the second case, where rings fail after a relatively short operat-
ing time, determine the lubricant consumption and check for too much 
lubrication. Always have a qualified individual determine required 
lubrication rates.
Here are the steps to follow if over-lubrication problems are 
suspected:
	
1.	 Determine the cycle time of the divider block used with the 
application point. With a stopwatch or the seconds-hand of a 
watch, measure the time for one complete cycle of the pin or 
LED flash. Record this time.
	
2.	 Calculate the proper lubrication rates.
For a two-throw high-speed compressor with an average piston 
speed of 900 fpm (4.6 m/s) at 900 RPM referred to on page 148:
	
 2 in packing = 2 × 2/5 pint/d = 0.8 pint/d (4–8 drops/min)	
	
2.5 in packing = 2.5 × 2/5 pint/d = 1 pint/d (5–10 drops/min)	
Lube Application Rate
Changing lubrication amounts or rates is often appropriate. However, 
before attempting to reduce the lube rate, have a competent indi-
vidual size the blocks and determine if the lubrication rate can be 
reduced. Remember that lowering the pump rate lowers the lubrica-
tion rate to each part of the system. Possibly, the problem may just be 
a case of oversized divider blocks. Divider blocks are relatively inex-
pensive and easy to change.
If the lube rate needs to be reduced, use the manufacturer’s pro-
cedures to lower the lubrication. Only reduce lubrication flow by 
about 5% at a time. Allow the compressor to run a week or two, then 
inspect for excessive ring wear before lowering the rate once again.
Scoring
When the rod begins to score and shows indentations of 1/16 inches 
(~1.5 mm) or deeper, using new packing is unlikely to solve blow-by 
problems. Expect packing life to be very short with severely scored 
rods. Rods are very expensive and the practice is to re-plate them. 

194	
C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
The important feature of plating is to obtain a hard sliding surface 
with enough porosity to hold lubrication. Alternatively, a plated sur-
face rubbing against Teflon must pick up and hold a mating layer of 
Teflon. Mirror finishes will not permit lube oil to stick and adhere; a 
measure of surface porosity is needed to hold the lubricant. Without 
lubricant, the rod surface will overheat and spider web cracks will 
form. After a while, pieces will flake off and chew up the packing. 
Chrome must be closely watched for this fault. Recommended rod 
finishes are 8 to 12 min (0.20–0.30 mm) Ra on Teflon and 95 min (2.45 mm) 
Ra maximum on bronze.
Rod Coatings
The economics of rod coatings are always important. Chrome is 
cheapest but has occasional problems of flaking off. Colmonoy is 
better than chrome but is not always readily available; it requires skill 
to apply it. Tungsten carbide and chromium carbide coatings will 
cost about the same as a new rod. However, with proper care, either 
of these coatings will last the life of the machine.
Valve Care
A valve plate lifts as the piston is approaching its maximum speed, 
usually one corner first, then the valve plate rises until it strikes the 
guard. It then returns to the seat at the end of the stroke, usually by 
spring pressure. It is then held in place by the pressure across the 
valve. If the valve plate strikes the guard hard enough to rebound to 
the seat, the result is valve flutter, a condition that can destroy a valve 
in a matter of hours. Valves today (2012) are all designed with this 
problem in mind so this problem occurs rarely.
Compressor unloaders were ranked one of top six causes of 
unscheduled compressor shutdowns.* A number of compressor mainte-
nance surveys confirmed that unloader-related shutdowns can be asso-
ciated with, although they are not limited to:
	 (a)	 Leakage of process gas (fugitive emissions) through the unloader 
packing at levels higher than allowed by applicable emissions 
and/or safety regulations
	 (b)	 Unloader seat leakage which can result from improper centering/
alignment of the unloader in the cylinder
	 (c)	 Unloader sticking/seizure preventing free movement of the 
unloader
	 (d)	 Unloader vibration resulting from an excessive pressure drop 
across the unloader valve

195
One way to reduce maintenance concerns associated with unloaders 
is to simply eliminate those capacity load steps that are no longer required. 
Removal of unnecessary unloaders simplifies the compression system 
and eliminates a possible source of maintenance. Upgrading the remain-
ing unloaders can significantly reduce or even eliminate some of the con-
cerns outlined above.*
Valve Flutter
Valve flutter is frequently mentioned as a valve problem; however, 
present-day valve design and good application have largely elimi-
nated valve flutter. One valve manufacturer has designed a second 
plate behind the main valve plate with a heavy set of springs; the 
second plate will cushion the valve plate travel and mitigate flutter, 
see Fig. 14.6. Other manufacturers may use additional springs or gas 
traps to cushion plate impact.
Valve Lift
As mentioned in an earlier chapter, total valve lift is very important 
with respect to efficiency and therefore power consumption. Total 
valve lift is also important in preventing flutter. Generally speaking, 
gas with heavier molecular weight (molar mass 20 and above) would 
have a lift of 0.08 in (2 mm) and gases with molecular weights of 
7 and below would have approximately 0.040 in (1 mm) lift, with

API-Recommended Velocities
These are larger than those normally used by industry. The compres-
sor manufacturers, in their concern for low valve horsepower losses, 
have often used larger valves (lower API velocities) than the opti-
mum needed for stable valve action. As an example, one manufac-
turer recommends API velocities for air of about 3200 fpm (16 m/s), 
and for hydrogen of about 7500 ft/min (38 m/s) at 15 psia (103 kPa 
absolute) and 3500 ft/min (18 m/s) at 200 psia (1380 kPa absolute) 
suction pressure.
Valve Plate Materials
As of the issue date of this text, most owner-operators had managed 
to upgrade their valve plates from metallic to thermoplastic materi-
als. Frequently however, they do not know or control the exact com-
position of the material they are using. They express surprise when 
valve failures are experienced due to higher than normal operating 
temperatures. Such failure occasions represent an opportunity to 
extend the temperature range of valve rings by choosing a different 
thermoplastic.
Valve Springs
These serve to control the timing of valve closings. The springs are sub-
jected to dynamic loading by the motion of the valve element. Element 

R e c i p r o c a t i n g  C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e 	
197
motion is periodic, but includes rapid acceleration and deceleration. It 
can therefore excite a wide range of frequencies in the spring. The 
resulting spring surge creates high stresses and is a major contributor 
to premature spring failure.
Valve failures are, as noted earlier, the most common reason for 
unscheduled compressor shutdowns. Valve springs in turn are the 
most frequent cause of valve failures. Therefore, valve spring life is of 
utmost importance in attaining increased compressor reliability.* If 
valve failures are caused by corrosion, specifying PEEK† valve plates 
with INCONEL X-750 springs, and piston rods of 17-7 PH stainless 
steel will very often eliminate this failure mode.
Checking Valve Lifts
An easy method of checking valve lifts and checking whether or not 
the valve assembly has free movement or is sticking is as follows: 
When the valve is assembled, a depth micrometer is used in an outlet 
port. Push through the outlet port and activate the plate through its 
full travel. The differential depth from when the plate is opened 
versus when it is closed will yield the valve lift. Generally, this 
requires more than one reading to determine if there is uneven wear 
of the stop plate. If there are strong spring forces, the valve plate may 
have to be pushed at two or more points simultaneously to guarantee 
that the plate has bottomed flatly onto the valve stop.
The best way to check valve lift is to disassemble the valve and 
measure its dimensions at multiple locations. Then, stacking up of 
dimensions will allow us to determine if the valve lift is correct. 
At disassembly and while measuring, we can perform a visual 
examination. Look for signs or contours of wear, mark the thickness 
of the plate, observe high spots, side clearances, etc.
When a valve is removed for checking and the plates are being 
replaced, care should be taken that both seat and guard are checked 
for wear. Lap both if in doubt.
Examine the replacement plates and seats, and also the guards for 
any sharp edges or corners. Since the plates lift off at a corner first and 
not straight up, any sharp edge or corner will give short valve life.
Suction valve unloaders are often a source of trouble. One ought 
to be wary of unloaders that lift a whole valve off the seat. Sooner or 
later the assembly will cock and break. Watch the fingers of suction 
valve lifters. They can crack when they strike the port when lifting the 
cover and then later break off in service. Work them by hand every 
time they are out for inspection.
Fastener Torque
Never over-torque valve cover nuts or jackscrews. This can distort 
the valve and lead to valve cover failures. If the cover leaks use a new

gasket and if that does not work, lap the cover on its seat. Radial lines 
indicate a leak or the start of a leak. If radial lines are visible on the 
gasket seat, the seat should be lapped.
Air compressors with their higher compression ratios and, there-
fore, higher adiabatic discharge temperatures, often have trouble 
with lube oil breakdown. The oil forms a carbon-based varnish which 
then coats the valve and seat. The coating action can cause valve plate 
distortion and early breakage. For these applications, take special 
note that discharge temperatures stay below 375°F (190°C) and be 
certain that only the best lubricant is used.
Liquid carryover is another valve problem. The liquid sits on the 
seat; it tends to distort the valve and often flashes to vapor between 
valve and seat. This erodes (“cuts”) the metal and will cause harm to 
valve seats. Whenever erosion is noted on valve seats, process and 
equipment design should be questioned as to the adequacy of knock-
out facilities in the system. (See index for key words liquid disengage-
ment or knockout drums.)
Valves in nonlubricated service tend to experience more problems 
than valves in services with cylinder lubrication. Manufacturers are 
utilizing Teflon or PEEK and other similar material components and 
coatings which have had success on process machines where tempera-
tures have been held below 350°F (177°C). In many new applications, 
however, trial and error for valve selection is still a proven method.
Temperature is the best indicator of valve malfunction. The old-
fashioned method of carefully and briefly touching each valve cover 
and noting if any one cover seems warmer than the others still 
remains a valid check. Whenever temperature deviations are sus-
pected, and certainly if temperatures are over 150°F (65°C), hand-
held pyrometers, often contact probes, should be used. Ultrasonic 
inspection using a hand-held probe or aiming a similar instrument 
at each valve cover has also been successful, as have thermographic 
(thermal monitoring) surveys. Both methods are very application and 
machine operation specific; either should be developed on a per-site 
basis with expert involvement.
Valve Repair Practices
Maintenance and repair procedures differ among the various valve 
types. However, certain general practices are shared by many com-
pressor valve configurations.
A guideline for valve inspection frequency cannot be given; it 
clearly depends on the type of compressor, the operating conditions, 
and properties of gas being compressed. Valve inspection and repair 
strategies vary from periodic inspection routines to wholesale valve 
replacement based on accumulated run time. Reference 3* points to 
*Pages 479 to 497.

statistical methods using Weibull analysis. A renewal function can be 
calculated by first determining the characteristic life and the failure 
patterns of compressor valves at one’s plant. Data collection is criti-
cally important to Weibull analysis and owner-operators have been 
able to arrive at the optimum, lowest cost complete set replacement 
interval by feeding data into commercially available Weibull soft-
ware. In new compressor installations, compressor valves should be 
inspected and cleaned within the first 1000 hours. At that time, slight 
wear on valve plate and valve seat might give an indication of desir-
able maintenance schedules.
When valves are only inspected and cleaned and no parts are 
remachined or replaced, matching the same valve seat and valve 
plate as originally assembled is needed. This is necessary to ensure 
proper tightness since the seating pattern will match perfectly.
Valve Component Replacement
When to replace valve components at inspection is a valid question. 
As a general rule, if the wear on the valve plate is even and less than 
10% of the original plate thickness, the plate can be cleaned and reused. 
Valve plates that are worn on one side should never be used in the 
reverse position. If the valve plate shows more wear than stated 
earlier or uneven wear or pitting, replace it along with all springs and 
machine, grind or lap the seat. If the valve seat is remachined, the 
valve plate and all springs should be replaced.
Valve Component Refurbishing
A valve seat is shown in Fig. 14.7. The seat face should be lapped 
every time a valve plate is replaced to prevent leakage, because the 
seating pattern from one valve plate to another is always different. 
Remachining of the seat face is almost always necessary when a metal 
valve plate has broken. There will be uneven seat wear at the location 
of breakage.

If the valve seat surface shows normal wear and no damage to the 
seat lands is obvious (dimension “S”), lapping or concentric grinding 
is sufficient. The seat band width “S” should be maintained to origi-
nal dimensions when remachining the seat surface. A valve seat can 
be remachined without affecting the valve performance until the 
ratio of b-to-c becomes 1:1 on drilled seats, and 3:2 on milled or cast 
seats. The bottom of the groove should not be machined to maintain 
the proper b-to-c ratio; this would weaken the seat.
·	 Valve guards (see Fig. 14.8). Valve guards do not normally 
have to be re-machined. If, for any reason, the top side is 
re-machined, dimension “t” should be at least equal to the 
guide ring thickness (if applicable).
·	 Valve plates. Metal valve plates should not be reground. If the 
wear on the plate exceeds 10% of the plate thickness, it should 
be replaced. Coil springs should be replaced every time valves 
are overhauled.
Valve repairs have to be carefully managed. They should be exe-
cuted in a dedicated valve shop where cleanliness would be of utmost 
importance. Many reciprocating compressor owner-operators send 
their valves to a reputable valve repair facility. The chosen valve 
repair shop should adhere to the following minimum requirements: 
	
1.	 Each valve is identified.
	
2.	 Each valve is dismantled and inspected for wear or breakage. 
An inspection report is issued.
	
3.	 Seats, guards, bolts, etc. are cleaned with a vapor blaster.

4.	 Seats and guards are inspected for cracks.
	
5.	 Seats and guards are re-machined to OEM specifications and, 
if necessary, metalized before machining. Seats are lapped or 
concentrically ground.
	
6.	 Each valve is assembled. Only OEM parts are used.
	
7.	 Each valve is function tested and two different leakage tests 
are required: (a) liquid test (1.5 minutes and slots of seat must 
be still half full) and (b) air test (using a flowmeter).
	
8.	 Each valve (if not nonlube) is dipped into rust preventing oil 
and wrapped.
	
9.	 Each valve is identified by a sticker on the wrapping.
Materials of construction for piston rings, wear bands, packing, and 
valve plates. It is very important that the materials of construction 
(MOC) of rider rings (wear bands), compression rings, packing rings, 
and valve plates are clearly identified by the compressor purchasers 
and owner-operators. Once this information is available, there is an 
opportunity for stepwise life improvement of these components. This 
improvement should go hand-in-hand with a well-established com-
puterized maintenance management system (CMMS); a CMMS must 
capture life data on all compressor components.
If piston and packing ring and also valve ring life are unsatisfac-
tory, a controlled program of introducing new materials should be 
considered. The first thing to do in a component life improvement 
program should be, again, the identification of mating materials such 
as cylinder wall and piston rod surfaces. These materials might have 
to be upgraded by a proper finish for the cylinder wall or by suitable 
coatings* applied to the piston rod with a finish ultimately to be 
defined by the packing ring supplier’s engineering department.
The most common materials for nonlubricated but also lubricated 
applications in reciprocating compressors are PEEK (polyether-ether-
ketone), PPS (polyphenylensulfide), PI (polyimide), and PAI (polyamide-
imide). These “high performance” thermoplastics, in their pure form, 
do not have the ability to run dry. However, they become very resis-
tant to wear once they are modified by additions of such lubricating 
substances as PTFE (10%–15% by weight), graphite, and molybdenum 
disulfide.
If the compressor OEM cannot assist in extending the life of the 
various wear components, owner-operators must work with well-
established compressor product companies. These companies must be 
* The portion of the piston rod which operates in the packing should be coated 
with Praxair’s Detonation Thermal Gun, “D Gun” (or equal), plasma-sprayed 
Tungsten Carbide with a thickness of 0.005 in (0.12 mm). Where filled PTFE 
packing is used, the surface finish of this coating should be 3 to 5 min RMS.

engaged in producing piston and rider rings, piston rod packing, and 
valve components for reliability-focused users. The favored suppliers 
may not be lowest in first cost, but will be superior to the competition 
based on failure risk reduction and safe operations strategies.
Noise and Vibration
Every reciprocating machine develops its own basic operating sound. 
Good operators can tune their ears to this sound and recognize 
changes during operation. Should changing sound patterns emerge, 
the facility must investigate the cause. It has been said that using 
noise as an indicator triggering preventive maintenance makes much 
economic sense. Of course, other predictive maintenance methods must 
also be applied in a reliability-conscious plant environment.
Knocks are the most common abnormal noise. Finding the cause 
of the knock is often more difficult than hearing it. Oddly enough, the 
first place to look for is in the cylinder adjacent to the crank throw 
where the knock is located. This is because, in almost every instance, 
a knock in the cylinder will be heard in the crankcase before it can be 
heard in the cylinder. The compressor piston nut could have come 
loose, or the compressor rod could unscrew from the crosshead. 
A knock can be heard from the piston sliding on the rod. If the piston 
or nut strikes the cylinder end, the knock will be quite pronounced.
Bullet-nosed pistons can droop due to excessive wear and the 
fillet radius on the piston end can strike the fillet radius on the 
cylinder. Broken valve plates drop into the cylinder and can interfere 
at the end of the stroke. Any of these faults can be readily located by 
cylinder inspection through a valve port. They can, however, cause a 
machine wreck rather quickly, which is why a precautionary machine 
shutdown or instant trip should be initiated as soon as knocking is 
heard and located.
Sometimes the compressor rod nut works loose repeatedly after 
re-torquing. Cylinder misalignment is the most probable cause. This 
can be rooted in broken grout under the crosshead pedestal, or by 
wedging up too tight under the discharge bottle. A fast check is to 
place a machinist level on the crosshead slipper and on the cylinder 
bore through a valve port, while the machine is still hot. If the bubbles 
in the levels are not identically placed in the glass, after instruments 
have been checked together side by side, then there is cause enough 
to examine the distance piece and compressor flanges for broken 
studs, or the unit may have to be realigned and regrouted. Always 
ascertain that discharge bottle wedges are not too tight after the 
machine reaches stable operating temperature.
Another cause of cylinder knocks is too tight a bump clearance on 
the head end. Every time the nut or rod has been backed off, the 
bump clearance must be taken and is to be set with the end clearance 

R e c i p r o c a t i n g  C o m p r e s s o r  M a i n t e n a n c e

allowance as recommended by the manufacturer allowing for rod 
expansion when heated. Frequently this information is shown on the 
cylinder nameplate. The rule-of-thumb is one-third of total clearance 
on the crank end and two-third on the head end of a cylinder.
Modern heavy duty compressors are built sturdy enough, so 
problems with crank cases occur rarely. Crosshead bushings, cross-
head shoes, connection rod shells and main bearings, with proper 
lubrication, should last the life of a machine, generally assumed to be 
at least 20 years (although some reciprocating compressors are still in 
service 60 years after commissioning). If knocks occur but cannot be 
located in the cylinder, the wrist pin clearances should be checked. 
Feeler gauges in the upper crosshead shoe can check for crosshead 
slap. Shake the connecting rod (the “conrod”) and feel for indications 
of slack shell side clearance. Jack up the crankshaft at the main bear-
ings (the “mains”) against a dial indicator to determine main bearing 
wear.
Frame (Crankcase) Repair Practices
Foundations
Reciprocating forces originating in the compressor frame (sometimes 
labeled the crankcase) must be absorbed or dissipated by passing 
through a concrete foundation and into the soil. For this to happen 
there must be a firm attachment between the frame and the founda-
tion. A cement or epoxy-based grout material must serve as the bonding 
material between the two. Unfortunately and over time, leakage of oil 
tends to degrade cementitious grouts; this can cause the frame to 
break free of the grout and start sliding back and forth relative to the 
foundation. This can be seen by examining the gap (usually oil-filled) 
between the grout and the side of the frame. Any “breathing” seen at 
that location is a danger signal. The deflection of the frame or crank-
case will be passed on and result in similar deflection of the crank-
shaft—a form of reverse-bending under stress. This can soon cause a 
broken crankshaft and a probable machine wreck.
Tightening the anchor bolts will not help; they are not designed to 
absorb the shaking forces acting on good foundations. Fortunately, 
effective and fast in-place pressure grouting systems have been 
developed. In case an entire foundation is in poor condition, the 
machine should be jacked up on railroad ties while the concrete is 
being refaced and cracks filled.
Some foundation designs are troublesome because they leave only 
1 to 2 in (25–50 mm) clearance under the oil pan of the frame. There 
are even less acceptable designs that leave no space at all. This causes 
the foundation to grow in the center from heat being generated from 
the crankcase and tilts the region under the frame flange. Broken 

204	
C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
anchor bolts are a likely result. To prevent this from happening, par-
ticularly when regrouting, leave a 12 in (30 cm) space under the pan. 
Leave the ends open to allow for ventilation, then place grout under 
the crankcase frame flange only. This, after all, is the only region where 
grout is required. The pan clearance is needed when the unit is 
mounted on sole plates or rails that are grouted in.
Crankshaft Deflections
The crankshaft is the heaviest and most expensive component of a 
reciprocating machine. It incorporates throws which can bend, fatigue, 
and break. If there is bending it will inevitably occur between the 
throws, which means that measuring here is of greatest importance.
Crank shaft web deflections can be checked by utilizing electronic 
deflection indicators.* If such an instrument is not available, use dial 
indicators. Dial indicator measurements are done by placing a dial 
gauge between the outer ends of the crank webs as shown in Fig. 14.9. 
Turn the crankshaft to place this crank at bottom dead center posi-
tion, 0°. Set the dial gauge at zero (0). With the gauge thus set and in 
place, rotate the crankshaft and take readings of the gauge at the back 
quarter position (90°), top center position (180°), and front quarter 
position of the crankpin (270°).
Where the connecting rod interferes with the indicator it will be 
necessary to move it out of the way. Calculate the reading back to the 
main journal position as shown in Fig. 14.10. Complete a table showing

deflections and temperatures. Keep the data in the compressor file for 
periodic future comparisons—trending incipient defects. Deflections 
change with temperature and hot deflections are considered accurate 
and relevant readings.
One throw showing an inconsistent reading at 180° is an indication 
of a wiped main bearing. A wiped bearing will also show deflection 
carryovers to the 90° and 270° position. Address the situation by rolling 
out the bearing shell and have it re-babbitted or replaced.
Realize that there are different grades of babbitt, some hard, some 
softer. The harder babbitt alloys have greater load-carrying capacities 
than the softer grades. But the harder babbitts will not be as (relatively) 
tolerant of dirty oil as will as the softer grades. Everything is a trade-off; 
try to be guided by competent manufacturers or non-OEM specialist 
rebuilders.
If the deflections show an increase in negative readings on the 
dial toward the center, take it as an indication that the crankcase has 
come free of the grout and is deflected down on both ends. This is 
usually caused by the ends of the machine sliding on the grout and 
wearing it down. Only re-grouting will fix this problem.
Deflections showing an increase in positive readings to the center 
should be viewed as foundation sag. Again, the foundation should be 
fixed.
Readings that show a change in measurement, positive or nega-
tive, at any position indicate an S-bend; this would probably be caused 
by worn main bearings across the machine. This can be confirmed by 
taking bearing lifts by putting a jack under the crank at each main in 
succession and locate an indicator on the top of the crank. Jacking up 
the crank will give the clearance in each main.
Crankshaft deflections are solid indicators of the state of health of 
the crankcase. Again, these readings should be taken periodically 
based on operating hours, i.e., once per year or so. If the deflections 
show no increase between inspection events, the crankcase is staying

in good repair and no problem should be expected. If changes are 
noticed, it would be very wise to perform annually a simple nonin-
trusive visual inspection. Further hints on compressor asset manage-
ment are beyond the scope of this text, but can be found in Ref. 4.
What We Have Learned
· Repair practices must be predefined and discussed with 
service providers and contractors.
· Dimensional limits (condemnation limits) on compressor 
valves and other applicable components must be agreed to 
by all involved parties.
· Repair procedures should be developed and followed by per-
sonnel involved in the repair process both on-site and off-site.
· To be profitable, an owner-user company will have to groom 
its own reciprocating compressor specialists. Grooming means 
mentoring, tutoring, teaching, learning, implementing with 
forethought and consistency. These pursuits take time and 
will be well worth the investment. Retain your compressor 
specialists by giving them absolute and unswervingly equi-
table pay or salary treatment. 
· On reciprocating compressors, be certain to never allow sev-
eral deviations to stack up. Understand the consequences 
and communicate your concerns to higher management.
· Buying reciprocating compressors of sturdy, conservative 
design will always be a wise investment.

CHAPTER 15
Maintenance and  
Operations 
Interfaces
C
lose cooperation between maintenance and operations per-
sonnel is an absolute requirement to ensure reliability and 
availability of reciprocating compressors. Operating and main-
tenance technicians must make a certain number of joint decisions 
well in advance. These two functional groups must also reach a firm 
understanding on who will be responsible for data taking on com-
pression equipment. Over the decades, the best and most profitable 
facilities have opted to assign data collection to the operators. Cor-
rective action steps requiring tools are assigned to the maintenance 
technicians.
At facilities with multitask training, the data taking and corrective 
action assignments often reside within the same group, but a number 
of limitations or boundaries are always spelled out and predefined.
After reaching consensus on the following, a major overhaul 
checklist (see end of chapter) should be compiled.
Shutdowns
Shutdown switches can be a nuisance—use only when really justified. 
The few essential “shutdown triggers” are:
	 (a)	 High gas discharge temperature for each cylinder
	 (b)	 Low-frame lube oil pressure
	 (c)	 High-frame vibration
	 (d)	 High level in upstream moisture separator or suction scrubber
	 (e)	 Driver overspeed, if other than an electric motor
The compressor and driver should be shut down by each of these 
switches at least once per year to check for proper operation; if found 

208	
C h a p t e r  F i f t e e n
faulty, the situation should be cleared up or the device replaced. 
These shutdowns should never be blocked out, bypassed, or ignored. 
Doing so will imperil physical assets and human lives. The time to 
test some of these devices is quite literally one minute before the 
scheduled shutdown commences. Also, operators should be assigned 
well-specified tasks to be handled during the shutdown. It is rather 
obvious that the various departments that operate, maintain, trouble-
shoot and analyze reciprocating compressors must cooperate very 
closely.
Monitoring and Record Keeping
Keeping logs from a maintenance standpoint is to determine the wear 
rate of the machine, to plan or schedule maintenance shutdowns, and 
to determine as closely as possible what must be done to minimize 
downtime. Plotting some of these readings on a curve with a time 
base can be helpful to recognize trends. Here are some suggested 
readings and checks:
	 (a)	 Daily
	
	 Lube oil pressure, deviation from normal range
	
	 Lube oil filter delta P (Dp, pressure drop)
	
	 Compressor discharge temperature and pressure (deviation)
	
	 Compressor packing vent, evidence of contaminants in leakage 
	
	 Lube oil consumption, deviation from range deemed acceptable
	 (b)	 Monthly
	
	 Lube consumption, crankcase
	
	 Lube consumption, cylinder lubricator
	
	 Operating hours
	
	 Compressor rod drop (if not already automatically provided 
by permanently installed rod drop-monitoring devices)
	
	 Safety switches (emergency shutdown or ESD tests)
	 (c)	 Annually for first operating year—then increase interval as 
experience is gained
	
	 Crank deflection
	
	 Compressor valves
	
	 Compressor rings
	
	 Compressor packing
	
	 Rod and liner finish
	
	 Connecting rod clearance
	
	 Wrist pin clearance
	
	 Crosshead clearance
Recording the scope, nature, and results of repairs on a specific 
valve, packing gland, or ring is essential. Generalized terms (such as 

M a i n t e n a n c e  a n d  O p e r a t i o n s  I n t e r f a c e s 	
209
“replaced bearings”) are not very useful for the reliability professional 
whose task is to prevent future events. The record must reflect details 
as to why, when, and where maintenance or remedial action was per-
formed.
Cleanliness and Tools
Operators have many tasks that involve blinds being inserted in 
piping, manipulating valves, observing component condition, tracking 
progress, updating procedures, taking photographs, etc. Make them 
the guardians of cleanliness and the watchdogs of proper tool usage. 
Their lives will be on the line later, so make them your deputy inspec-
tors and quality control enforcers.
Cleanliness is vital in machinery. Seemingly harmless dirt gathers 
in some places inside a compressor during operation. This accumula-
tion then becomes disturbed when the machine is opened. Therefore, 
open machines up only when there is a good reason to do so. Before 
closing it up, wipe it down carefully and thoroughly.
When closing up a reciprocating compressor, special care must be 
taken that dowels fit properly; experience shows that they often hang 
up on burrs. Torque all nuts correctly. Never over-torque nuts because 
doing so distorts castings, bearing, and valve caps. Distortion will 
cause early failure. Make certain that the piston rod nuts are fastened 
and check the bump clearance. Reciprocating compressor owners 
and operators must adhere to “best torquing practices.” They are 
crucial to the long-term reliability of components such as valve covers, 
for example. Good maintenance management should address the 
following issues pertaining to torque application in the field:
	 (a)	 The friction factor. There should be a clear understanding 
about the use of petroleum lubricants on threads before 
attempting bolt-up. Quantities and type of lubricant should 
be defined for consistency of results. There is an up to 35 per-
cent reduction in bolt or stud stress levels obtained when a 
nut is torqued with a dry thread.
	 (b)	 The operator. Field technicians should have a good understand-
ing of torquing sequence when bolts or studs to be torqued are 
arranged in a bolt circle.
	 (c)	 Geometry. Field technicians should be held to make gap mea-
surements of a completed joint. Variations in circumferential 
gap measurements in 90° steps would be an indicator of 
uneven load distribution worthy of investigation.
	 (d)	 Tool accuracy. A testing and calibration schedule for torque 
wrenches must exist. If such a program is not implemented, 
the result of maintenance interventions involving the use of 

210	
C h a p t e r  F i f t e e n
torque wrenches will become questionable. The more accu-
rate the tool or stud tightening measuring system, the more 
accurately a bolt or stud can be preloaded.
	 (e)	 Relaxation. There is no doubt about a relaxation effect in any 
bolted assembly—it can be overcome by scheduled torque 
checks.
Follow up by checking the pipe load on flanges. Pipe supports 
often get bent or distorted and can put cylinders out of alignment. 
Finally, clean up the foundation and look for cracks. If any are visible, 
try to check the depth and provide a record for possible regrouting 
work during the next overhaul.
Major Overhaul Checklist for Reciprocating Compressors
	
1.	 Check clearance of main and connecting rod bearings.
	
2.	 Inspect crank pin, crosshead pin bushings, and crosshead 
bearings.

alignment.
	
4.	 Check alignment of crosshead and piston; readjust shoes, 
if necessary, using level on crosshead guide and cylinder 
base.
	
5.	 Check alignment of cylinder to crosshead and frame.
	
	 (a)  Mount dial indicator on cylinder housing and take read-
ing on rod in horizontal and vertical direction through 
stroke.
 
  
  ·  If greater than 0.003″(76 mm) in vertical direction, cor-
rect by shimming crosshead shoes.

check various fits and joints; correct as necessary.
	
	 (b)  Alternative to (a) in this list, use alignment wire or laser 
tool through centers of cylinder bore and crosshead guide 
bores.
	
6.	 Inspect all stud nuts for tightness (crankcase cover, distance 
piece, etc.).
	
7.	 Inspect, measure, and record piston and cylinder diameters.

The most effective way to bring about seamless cooperation 
between maintenance and operations departments was conclusively 
demonstrated in the mid 1970s. This is when one of the co-authors 
reported to a plant manager. The manager was innovative and could 
not be fooled by people who merely generated noise. He told his 
maintenance department head and his top operations person that he, 
the plant manager, would call them within a year and tell them to 
trade their respective job functions. The operations manager would 
from that day on be the maintenance manager and the maintenance 
manager would be in charge of operations. The two cooperated from 
the first day to the last. They learned each other’s craft and were 
ready for switching jobs within six months. The plant manager made 
the call about 8 months later and the job trading went flawlessly. The 
plant, the corporation, and everyone associated with these events 
was convinced it was a true winning strategy. Each of the two depart-
ment manager had learned to become equally competent. They were 
able to demonstrate insight and success. They had learned the man-
datory “3 Cs”—Cooperation, Communication, and Consideration.
What We Have Learned
There are overlapping responsibilities in compressor maintenance 
and operation. In general, data taking and spotting deviations from 
normal machine behavior is an operator responsibility. Problem cor-
rection and adjustments using other than simple tools is assigned to 
mechanical workforce members.
Shutdown procedures and work lists are developed by joint 
effort. All affected job functions contribute to this effort. The results 
are formalized in written procedures or checklists.

Surveillance, 
Monitoring, and 
Troubleshooting 
Reciprocating 
Compressors
S
urveillance and monitoring of reciprocating compressors are terms 
used interchangeably. With few exceptions, the monitoring and/or 
surveillance tasks are assigned to the operators. They look for 
deviations from the agreed-upon operating behavior and take corrective 
action. Corrective action consists primarily of adjustments which require 
no tools other than perhaps a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. If remedial 
action involves the use of other tools, operating technicians are expected 
to interface with maintenance or reliability personnel. The work scope of 
maintenance personnel is to keep compressors at as-purchased perfor-
mance. The work scope of reliability personnel is to view every mainte-
nance event as an opportunity to upgrade. Reliability personnel must 
answer the question if upgrading—the removal of weak links in the 
component chain—is feasible. If they answer in the affirmative, it will be 
their responsibility to submit cost-justification data to management.
Surveillance
General
	
1.	 The key aspects of reciprocating compressor operation which 
require operator surveillance are:
 
· Condition of compressor valves
 
· Rod loading

214	
C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
 
· Rod packing vent emission
 
· Vibration and noise
 
· Lubrication—frame and cylinder
 
· Cylinder coolant
 
· Cylinder temperature
Valves
	
1.	 The common causes of valve failure are:
 
· Dirt in the gas stream
 
· Liquid in the gas
 
· Insufficient cylinder lube oil
 
· Gas pressure pulsations
 
· Valve instability or “flutter”
 
· Corrosive attack on valve material
 
· Pieces of broken piston rings or other parts falling into the 
valve passages
 
· Valve seat distorted by faulty installation
	
2.	 Indications of valve failure are:
 
· High temperature at the valve cover
 
· A reduction in capacity
 
· Noise
 
· An increase in discharge temperature
	
3.	 Change in the interstage pressure of a multistage compressor 
is an indication of valve failure:
 
· If a valve on the lower stage fails, the interstage pressure 
decreases.
 
· If a valve on the higher stage fails, the interstage pressure 
increases.
 
·	 For compressors with unloading control devices, the inter-
stage pressure for each stage of unloading should be 
recorded in the “as-new” condition, to provide a standard 
for monitoring.
	
4.	 Valves must be repaired as soon as they fail in order to avoid:
 
· Scoring of the rod, piston, rings, and liner
 
· Failure of the rod packing
 
· Piston seizure or breakage
	
5.	 Valve repair is also necessary in order to restore:
 
· Flow capacity
 
·	 Operating efficiency
 
·	 Normal cylinder-operating temperatures
	
6.	 The key to analysis of valve failures is an accurate record 
system which should include:
 
·	 Port location of valve failure
 
· Identity of the particular valve seat involved in failure

· Operating conditions preceding failures
 
· Nature and cause of failure, to the extent known
	
7.	 Operator monitoring of compressor piston rod loading is 
critical because:
 
· Most major damage to reciprocating compressors results 
from excessive rod loading.
 
· Rod failures can be hazardous to personnel and cause 
fires, as well as being costly to repair.
 
· Rod load is not indicated directly by any single instru-
ment sensing, and is not protected by alarm or trip 
features.
 
· The rod load provides the simplest index of the loading 
level on other elements in the compressor power frame: 
head bolts, pistons, connecting rods, cross heads, bear-
ings, etc.
	
8.	 To monitor rod loads, a “rod load limit” graph should be 
developed for each compression stage as shown earlier in 
Chapter 14 (Fig. 14.2). This graph should be posted in the 
operations control room.
Packing Vents
	
1.	 The emissions or drainage from the rod packing vent (or drain) 
is a key indication of cylinder’s mechanical condition. A small 
amount of lubricant is emitted from the vent line.
 
 · Rate of gas emission varies with cylinder pressure level, 
packing design, and packing condition.
 
 · Since instrumentation is not provided to measure this gas 
rate, it must be judged subjectively.
 
 · Source of oil is rod packing lubricant and, to a lesser 
extent, cylinder wall lubricant.
 
 · Oil color and metal content reflect mechanical condition; 
dark oil color and/or bright metal particles in the oil indi-
cate internal wearing.
 
 · On nonlube compressors, the gas emission rate provides 
an indication of rod packing condition.
Vibration and Noise
	
1.	 If reciprocating compressor cylinders vibrate, look for:
 
· Loose supports under cylinders or piping
	
·	 Loose studs or bolts on the machine
	
·	 Deteriorated grout
 
·	 Excessive rod loading
	
·	 Speed or load above rating
	
·	 Moisture entrainment in suction piping

216	
C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
	
2.	 Gas pulsations can also make reciprocating compressors vibrate, 
due to:
 
· Pulsations created by operation in parallel with other 
machines
 
· Speed higher or lower than optimum
 
· Broken baffles in pulsation bottles
 
· Faulty valve  in one end of a cylinder
	
3.	 Some common sources of noise emanating from a malfunc-
tioning reciprocating compressor include:
 
· Expander rings of the piston, cutting the liner, emit a chat-
tering knock
 
· Tilting or rocking of the crosshead against its slider bearing 
emits a slapping noise
 
· Liquid in the gas causes transient knocks of varying intensity
 
· A piston striking one of the cylinder heads emits a heavy 
thumping noise
	
4.	 Knocking noises in compressor cylinder can also be caused by:
 
· An unsecured cylinder liner sliding axially to impact against 
a head
 
· Metallic debris within the cylinder
 
· Excessive clearance in the crosshead bushings, connecting 
rod bearings, or crank shaft bearings
 
· Loose valve assembly, loose packing, loose piston
	
5.	 To locate the source of noise:
 
· Note that most noises appear to emanate from the crank-
case, whatever their actual source may be.
 
· Try to identify which cylinder or slider-crank assembly is 
producing the noise, if this can be safely done before stop-
ping the machine.
 
· Note severity of the noise, its character, and whether it is 
changing.
 
· Allow no one to stand near or opposite the outboard end of 
an operating cylinder emitting unusual noises of any kind.
Lubrication
	
1.	 Crankcase lube oil must be monitored for:
 
· Proper level—neither too low or too high, however, use 
numerical values in specific cases.
 
· Temperature upstream and downstream of the oil cooler. 
Typical crankcase temperatures are 68°C ± 3° (155°F ± 5°); 
oil is supplied to the bearings at 60°C ± 3° (140°F ± 5°).
 
· Oil pressure to the bearings: Falling pressure means pres-
sure regulator problems, oil pressure safety valve problems, 
possibly bearing wear, or oil pump wear.
 
· Typical oil filter pressure drop at which filter should be 
replaced or cleaned—1.4 bar (20 psi).

M o n i t o r i n g  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e 	
217
	
2.	 Monitoring of compressor and engine cylinder force feed 
lubricator system requires:
 
· Confirming flow to all locations
 
· Controlling oil flow rate at level determined to be optimum
 
· Keeping the lubricant reservoir filled
	
3.	 Cylinder liner condition should be inspected for proper 
lubrication:
 
· After break-in of a new or overhauled cylinder
 
· After changing lubricant or oil injection rate
 
· Each time a valve is removed for service
	
4.	 When inspecting cylinder liner conditions:
 
· Liner surface should be uniformly bright.
 
· Check 6 O’clock position for beginning of scuffing or scoring.
 
· Lube film should be very light—almost imperceptible on 
a finger, but visible when wiped with cigarette paper or 
newspaper-type stock.
 
· Confirm that each oil injection hole is open and functioning.
	
5.	 The effectiveness of cylinder wall lubricants can be drasti-
cally reduced by dilution with liquid in the gas stream, com-
ing from:
 
· Carryover from the suction knock-out drum
 
· Condensation along the suction line
 
· Condensation within the compressor cylinder suction valve 
chambers, due to excessive cylinder lubrication
Cylinder Cooling
	
1.	 When reciprocating compressors are provided with a circu-
lating coolant for cylinder jacket cooling, the coolant flow 
should be carefully monitored:
 
· Coolant supply temperature should be at least 6°C (10°F) 
warmer than the gas inlet temperature (preferably 
8°C–11°C or 15°F–20°F) to avoid condensation within the 
cylinder.
 
· Cooling water supply should be no more than 17°C (30°F) 
warmer than gas inlet temperature to avoid flow capacity 
loss.
 
· The cooling water temperature rise across the cylinders 
should be at least 8°C (15°F), and preferably 11°C (20°F).
 
· Cooling water outlet temperature should normally be in 
the 46°C to 63°C (115°F–145°F) range.
	
2.	 Typical clearances of a newly overhauled 180 mm (7 in) diam-
eter cylinder are:
 
· Piston to cylinder liner, 18 to 25 mm (.007–.010 in.)—overhaul 
needed at three to four times this level
 
· Piston rod run-out (or “hop”) in the running condition: 
2.5 to 7.5 mm (.001–.003 in.)

218	
C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
Monitoring
	
1.	 Careful monitoring of the temperatures of reciprocating com-
pressor cylinders is an effective way to:
 
· Achieve maximum gas flow rate
 
· Achieve high compressor efficiency
 
· Reduce maintenance costs
 
· Reduce unscheduled downtime
 
· Permit scheduling maintenance work for convenient time 
periods
	
2.	 The two main concerns in monitoring reciprocating compres-
sors cylinders are:
 
· To avoid excessive discharge temperature
 
· To find indications of deteriorating compressor valves and 
piston rings
	
3.	 Factors that affect cylinder discharge temperatures most 
are:
 
· Inlet temperature
 
· Compressor ratio
 
· Specific heat ratio, k (cp/cv), of the gas
 
· Mechanical condition of the valves and cylinders
	
4.	 Specific guidelines for maximum allowable compressor dis-
charge temperature are:
 
· See the manufacturer’s operating and maintenance manual 
and the machine specifications.
 
· Note distinction between maximum discharge temperature 
for which a new compressor should be designed (staging 
and intercooling design), versus the maximum discharge 
temperature at which a specific, existing compressor should 
be allowed to operate.
	
5.	 The areas of mechanical deterioration which cause increased 
discharge temperature are:
 
· Piston rings and their mating cylinder liners—probably 
allowing blow-by
 
· Compressor suction and discharge valves—probably allow-
ing cyclic flow reversal in valve chamber area
Temperature Measurement
	
1.	 Methods of observing cylinder temperature include:
 
· Control panel–mounted temperature indicators
 
· Local thermometers
 
· Portable surface or infrared temperature indicators
 
· Hand touch—for identification of obvious valve failures

M o n i t o r i n g  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e 	
219
 
· Automatic temperature difference detection equipment—
installed systems and portable instruments
 
· Electronic differential thermometer designed primarily for 
compressor valve monitoring
	
2.	 To identify cylinders which require maintenance, operators 
should compare:
 
· Valve cover temperature against other covers of parallel 
valves on the same cylinder
 
· Discharge temperature of parallel cylinders on the same 
compressor
 
· Temperatures of discharge lateral pipes of parallel com-
pressor units
	
3.	 Guidelines for evaluating differences between the discharge 
temperatures of cylinders operating in parallel:
 
· 0.5°C (1°F) difference is a warning of possible deterioration.
 
· 1.5°C (3°F) difference indicates a faulty condition in the 
cylinder with the higher temperature.
Efficiency Calculations
	
1.	 The discharge temperature is the key factor in the determina-
tion of the operating efficiency of a compressor cylinder. 
Two methods are recommended for calculating and tracking 
efficiency:
 
· Polytropic efficiency, which allows for actual change in 
entropy of the gas during compression (a minor factor in 
most reciprocating compressors).
 
· Isentropic (adiabatic) efficiency, which assumes no change 
in entropy during compression (a fairly accurate assump-
tion for most reciprocating compressors).
 
· Both methods are satisfactory for monitoring cylinder con-
ditions. The choice will depend on the user’s preference for 
the computations required. Applying both methods allows 
a double check.

that differences between efficiency values calculated by the 
polytropic and isentropic methods are small and unimport-
ant when performing routine monitoring. However, it is 
important that a consistent method be used when comparing 
values. Helpful diagrams (Fig. 16.2) facilitate quick estima-
tion of power draw as a function of suction and discharge 
pressures for certain defined reference conditions.

Troubleshooting
Very few pieces of petrochemical process machinery lend themselves 
to early symptom-cause identification as do reciprocating compressors.* 
This becomes evident when considering how the neglect of subtle 
performance changes can result in costly wrecks. For instance, high 
discharge temperatures can result from the simple primary cause of 
insufficient coolant supply. Not responding to this cause will lead to 
an overheated cylinder and ultimately to such events as piston sei-
zure, ring breakage, and piston cracking. Similarly, it would be a mis-
take not to respond to such audible symptom as “knocking in cylin-
der,” where the most probable cause is inadequate piston-to-head 
clearance. Inadequate clearance will ultimately lead to piston failure 
or rod breakage with attendant damage to the crosshead.
When troubleshooting reciprocating compressors, the most impor-
tant symptoms to watch for are unusual sounds and changes in 
pressures, temperatures, and flow rates. Consequently, the primary 
troubleshooting tools are our five senses, two pressure gauges, two 
temperature indicators, and a flow meter. Generally, flow meters are 
not available for each individual stage of compression, but considering 
that what enters the front end will exit at the back end, flow measure-
ment at one stage along the way is sufficient at installations where no 
interstage inlets or knockouts are involved.
It is important to use a historical compressor log sheet to record 
interstage pressures and temperatures by stage on multistage com-
pressors. When interstage operating conditions vary from normal, it 
indicates trouble with one of the stages. Generally, when the interstage 
pressure suddenly drops, look at the lower pressure cylinder. If the 
interstage pressure suddenly rises, look at the higher pressure cylinder.
Compressor temperatures and pressures are basic to design cal-
culations and help determine compressor health. The difference 
between the observed and calculated temperatures should be more 
or less constant from day to day. The actual observed or calculated 
temperature may vary; also, when suction temperatures increase, so 
will discharge temperatures. If the compression ratio across a cylin-
der increases, its discharge temperature also increases. Comparing 
calculated and actual discharge temperatures provides a means with 
which to determine operating deviations.
Vibration analysis is usually applied to rotating equipment such 
as centrifugal compressors. It can also be useful for reciprocating com-
pressors. Vibration analysis can alert us to coupling misalignment, 
even with relatively low-speed reciprocating compressors. Some 
troubleshooters have used vibration measurements in the analysis of 
piping fatigue failures and cracking or other fractures initiated by 
inherent system resonance and pulsations. Some of these problems are 
*Reference 2.

M o n i t o r i n g  a n d  S u r v e i l l a n c e

caused by first or second orders of running speed; either can excite 
resonant frequencies in pipe runs. Usually, if the vibration frequency 
is higher than twice the running speed of the machine, acoustic pulsa-
tions are suspected.
The following trouble shooting symptom-and-reaction listing is 
offered as a basic guide only. It lists the more common issues with 
their most probable remedies. It may be expanded to address specific 
installations, package configurations, and actual operating conditions.

A more detailed analysis of the symptom-cause-failure chain may 
be in order and Table 16.1 can serve this purpose. Far more detailed 
information can be gleaned from a Bloch-Hoefner text covering this 
subject.*

Beta* analyzers allow us to directly recognize what is happening 
inside a compressor cylinder. This method of analysis, further explained 
in Ref. 2 of Chapter 5, can be extremely helpful in solving problems 
related to valve losses and piston-ring leakages. Such analytical equip-
ment can be expensive, but there are companies supplying this service 
on either a contract or a one-time basis.†
Operators and maintainers of large fleets of reciprocating com-
pressors in the oil and gas patch have been leading in establishing 
a record of successful automated performance data collection. They 
have implemented a system that reports process information from 
field stations, takes this data and turns it into usable information 
for both field operations and engineers. Operators at the compres-
sor site enter operating data into customized checklists on hand-
held devices called portable data terminals (PDTs). When the oper-
ator is in range of a wireless internet connection, he or she can 
synchronize the data with servers over the web. A proprietary pro-
gram instantaneously rationalizes the raw data, incorporates it into 
a user-accessible fleet-management database, and produces a detailed 
diagnostic report.
The report provides the operator with immediate feedback on 
the operating health of the compressor, complete with recommenda-
tions for both maintenance and production opportunities. The report 
helps the user to quickly see which compressors are operating inef-
ficiently and which ones are at risk. The following beneficial results 
are claimed:
· Site-specific field inspection forms
· An electronic compliance calendar for scheduling
· Inspection events, and
· A corrective action–tracking system that allows operators 
and engineers along with outside specialists to assign tasks 
to resolve field deficiencies
· Delivery of an average benefit-to-cost ratio of 5:1‡
In spite of the above-described sophistication, we must in all 
cases remember that from a diagnostic point of view one-time read-
ings are no substitute for recorded historical operating data. After 
all, the most decisive feature of a trouble symptom is its upside/
downside change.

CHAPTER 17
Reciprocating 
Compressor 
Upgrading, 
Rebuilding, and 
Remanufacturing
W
hether one’s company must replace a reciprocating pro-
cess compressor or an entire compressor fleet, it is always 
best to look at all available options before making such a 
substantial equipment investment. Compressor owner-operators are 
sometimes surprised how cost-effective it can be to buy a remanufac-
tured compressor. Naturally, there are upsides and downsides to this 
approach and we should be familiar with all reasonable options.
There are minor and major distinctions between the various defi-
nitions. Many definitions overlap, but still deserve to be listed: 
· Inspection: An activity aimed at determining which compressor 
parts are in need of repair
· Overhaul: Reconditioning and repairing of what needs to be 
repaired, bringing into compliance with perceived original 
condition
· Repair: Replacing parts that have deteriorated or are found 
defective
· Rebuilding: Dismantling, disassembly, and reassembly involving 
a compressor and its mounting location
· Refurbishment: Same as rebuilding, but including auxiliary 
support system upgrades

232	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
· Upgrading: Strengthening parts that fail more often than other 
parts; systematically removing the weak links in a compo-
nent chain so as to extend availability and reliability
· Conversion: Implementing changes to accommodate major 
differences in service or application
· Rerating: Modifications with the goal of reducing rated through-
put for the purpose of gaining mechanical efficiency, or increas-
ing throughput capability to gain production capability
· Revamping: Modifying for the purpose of adapting to new 
process conditions
· Reapplication: Same as revamping, but often involving compres-
sors that had been out of service for some time (mothballed)
· Remanufacture: Total strip-down into every component, nut, 
and bolt, full and uncompromising measurement and/or 
testing of every part
Here is more detail on some of the activities mentioned.
Inspection, Overhaul, and Repair
Besides operating, the normally expected activities around reciprocat-
ing compressors are inspection, overhaul, and repair (IO&R); the other 
functions listed above are extraordinary measures as the machine 
moves through its life cycle. Historically, IO&R was conducted in 
refineries and chemical plants by in-house “captive” maintenance 
forces supported by a central machine shop. These programs were 
self-directed and were carried out with the occasional assistance of 
OEM field service personnel.
As time went on, captive maintenance forces were reduced and 
supplemented by outside contractors. In a typical setting, an experi-
enced company technician would lead a group of contract mechanics 
in carrying out the required IO&R. Starting in the late 1990s and as this 
text went to press (2012), many owner-operators of reciprocating com-
pressors have resorted to completely contractor-conducted IO&R 
programs. Depending on the sophistication of owners or contractors, 
either periodic or predictive maintenance strategies are followed to 
determine IO&R intervals. Due to cost considerations, upgrading and 
concurrent rebuilding of compressor parts as opposed to purchasing 
expensive OEM spare parts became a normal practice. The compres-
sor world was therefore not surprised more than a decade ago when a 
reputable major upstream reciprocating compressor manufacturer* 
announced it had discontinued its new unit business and would forth-
with only sell remanufactured machines.

Rebuilding
The rebuild process takes existing components or entire compressor 
units and returns them to the original factory specification as part of 
a preventive maintenance program. This would reduce the risk of 
potential compressor failures to occur during peak operating busi-
ness cycles; the practice is a natural outflow of the overhaul and 
repair routine. It was a normal procedure when compressor fleet 
owners had access to in-house repair shops. The cost to rebuild exist-
ing components of reciprocating compressors and even rebuilding 
entire machines is certainly lower than the cost of replacing them 
with new equipment. Additionally, the owner-operator controls the 
downtime schedule and selects its timing to have the least impact on 
business. An example is the rebuilding and upgrading of piston rods 
in the maintenance environment as demonstrated by the topics 
expounded in a repair specification, Fig. 17.1. An actual specification 
would comprise many pages and would become the discussion basis 
for maintenance, repair, and rebuilding activities.

Upgrading, Conversion, Rerate, Revamp, or Reapplication 
Decisions Resulting in Rebuilding, Refurbishment, and 
Remanufacturing of Existing Reciprocating Compressors
Upgrading, converting, rerating, revamping, or reapplying existing 
equipment can help meet new or changing compression requirements 
with existing equipment. This activity then provides a cost-effective 
alternative to the purchase of new equipment and projects can gener-
ally be completed in a shorter time period. Additionally, this approach 
can extend equipment life, increase reliability, and improve avail-
ability by incorporating the latest material and design technology. 
Finally, it reduces compressor cylinder fugitive emissions to meet 
current and future environmental requirements.
Competent corporations* recognize the interaction of hardware 
and software. They typically specialize in custom compressor cylin-
ders and unloaders as well as interactive performance software. One 
leading supplier is also known for providing performance-enhanced 
compressor components such as pistons, rods, liners, and custom 
valves as well as engineering services that include thermodynamic 
performance reviews, acoustic studies, and more.
A case in point involved the conversion of valve-in-head cylinder 
designs—see Fig. 17.2—to a more reliable and cost-effective configu-
ration. The three-piece cylinder body was a common design tradition-
ally supplied by many compressor OEMs decades ago. However, in 
this traditional design it took time to access the pistons, and their large 
size meant dealing with heavy masses. The old cylinders incorporated 
a large quantity of threaded fasteners in relatively inconvenient loca-
tions. Finally, gasket material discontinuations had made it increas-
ingly difficult to obtain reliable and safe gaskets.
The revamp case involved a U.S. pipeline company in 2007 with 
the Cooper-Bessemer GMVA-10 integral engine compressor shown in 
Fig. 17.3. The machine was used in natural gas storage/withdrawal 
service with a maximum working pressure (MWP) of 1200 psig (82.7 bar).
The upgrade solution centered on providing cast ASTM A395 
ductile iron cylinders of the type shown in Figs. 17.4 and 17.5. More 
specifically, it also involved
· A total of (16) cylinder replacements on (4) compressors
· A valve-in-barrel design which eliminated large gaskets
· A full-fledged bolt-in replacement approach
· Using and refurbishing existing valves and packing
· Rerating and refurbishing the existing clearance pockets
· Employing a water-cooled, jacketed cylinder design with a 
bore diameter of 12.0 in (304.8 mm), stroke: 14.0 in (355.8), 
testing compliance for an MWP of 1200 psig (82.7 bar)

In essence, the new and improved design resulted in higher reli-
ability and safety by providing gasket elimination which reduces pos-
sible gas and coolant leaks. It can be reasoned that leakage avoidance 
increases plant safety. Fewer and more accessible fasteners reduce 
maintenance effort and cost of both labor and downtime. Consider-
able savings accrued by reusing most existing cylinder components. 
The revamp or upgrade approach preserves the value of an existing 
spare parts inventory.

It demonstrably minimized replacement cost by reusing existing 
pulsation bottles and mounting locations. Finally, it minimized the 
required installation downtime.
Remanufacturing is defined as an industrial process in which worn-
out products are restored to like-new condition. Through a series of 
industrial processes in a factory environment, a discarded product is 
completely disassembled. Useable parts are cleaned, refurbished, 
and put into inventory. Then the product is reassembled from the 
old parts—and where necessary, new parts—to produce a unit fully 
equivalent and sometimes superior in performance and expected life-
time to the original new product.* This would be in contrast to rebuilt 
or repaired and repainted like most others.
The following benefits of remanufacturing are claimed:
· The whole compression unit undergoes a comprehensive 
process to ensure reliability and performance
· Restored to like-new condition
· Meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) new 
equipment specifications
· Same warranty as new
· Receive full mechanical and performance testing
· Shorter lead times
· Reduced downtime
· Cost savings
· Lower energy costs
· Latest technological upgrades
· Increased productivity
Remanufacturing of reciprocating compressors is often carried out 
by the OEM, but there are numerous independent service shops taking 
on the job.† Some of these non-OEM companies have been supplying 
their customers with new and remanufactured reciprocating compres-
sors for almost 30 years. Especially in the high-speed reciprocating 
compressor after-market we find large inventories of used and rebuilt 
major compressor components such as frames, crankshafts, cylinders, 
and pistons.
Of course, the OEMs are not staying idle. One OEM‡ states that 
they often work with equipment or parts the user or owner has 
already on hand, even if they did not build them. This strategy allows

owner-operators to place idle assets back into production and thus 
reduce the cost of doing business. Should the owner not have the 
appropriate equipment, the OEM claims to be able to locate it for him. 
If the equipment is out there—anywhere in the world—the OEM offers 
to find it fast.
Once a suitable unit is located, the OEM completely overhauls it 
to bring it up to the specifications required by the purchaser’s appli-
cation and delivers it to the owner with service manuals and a parts 
and labor warranty. The OEM offers to keep the purchaser informed 
during each stage of the remanufacturing process. The OEM also is 
usually able to provide field installation and start-up services for a 
remanufactured unit.
An example: When an air separation client asked an OEM to 
reapply a reciprocating compressor from nitrogen service to hydro-
gen service on the Gulf Coast, there was no time to waste: the client 
had an opportunity window for their product stream and the equip-
ment needed to be ready at the appropriate stage of the new site 
construction.
The plan was to remanufacture the client’s compressor frame and 
install new cylinders. Compared to purchasing a new unit, this would 
reduce costs, shorten the delivery schedule, and reutilize an existing 
production asset.
While the frame was being remanufactured at one of the OEM’s 
service centers, the cylinders were being engineered and built at 
another location. The cylinders were shipped to the service center and 
mounted on the frame. All system tests and inspections were com-
pleted before the equipment was shipped to assure that all compo-
nents fitted together correctly, all tolerances were met, and all systems 
were functioning properly. This simplified field installation and min-
imized the risk of costly delays—especially important since the con-
struction delays had cut the installation time in half.
As a minimum, the purchaser of a remanufactured compressor 
should expect the following essential steps:
· Disassembly
· Inspection and tear-down report
· Parts to be replaced
· Assembly
· Leakage test
· Test run
· Painting
The most important step is an appropriate disassembly and 
inventory taking process followed by the above inspection and tear-
down report as listed in Table 17.1.

C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
It is important that, upon receiving the unit, the loads of the 
machine are evenly distributed. The compressor should be blocked or 
shimmed to obtain as close as possible level condition. Caution should 
be exercised when lifting and moving the unit in order to avoid stress 
loads in areas that are not designed to carry the load. Individual check 
lists should be prepared for all measurements and procedures used in 
the rebuild and remanufacturing process.
Modern coupling alignment tools are a must for a typical com-
pressor remanufacturing facility. It would offer laser alignment tasks 
for any type of coupled equipment.
Modern bore alignment equipment is another requirement. Along 
with coupling alignment, laser tools are capable of measuring bores 
in internal combustion engines, compressors, compressor cylinders, 
and other machinery from 5 to 30 in (127–762 mm) diameter. A bore 
alignment tool is used to measure crankshaft bores. Once measure-
ments are taken, one laser transmitter is set outside the last bore. 
A laser receiver is then rotated in each of the bores. The computer 
calculates the straightness and location of each bore within 0.0001 in 
(2.5 μm). It also measures alignment of multiple bores and are in-line 
with one another and in-line with the rotating centerline of the shaft. 
The measurements should be traceable to ISO 9000/MIMOSA stan-
dards. Complete reports can be printed instantly on location.
Contact with Service Shops*
The person or persons responsible and accountable for reciprocating 
maintenance should establish contact with service shops. This is best 
done by visiting them and judging their facilities, also their “track 
record” and the experience of their personnel. This review could lead 
to a numerical rating on a scale of 1 to 10 help with the final decision.
It goes without saying that quotations for new equipment prices 
should be obtained, so that the practicality of a repair, rebuild, or 
remanufacturing order can be ascertained. For instance, as a rule of 
thumb it would not be advisable to have an electric motor rewound if 
costs exceeded 70 percent of a new equivalent replacement, or if higher 
efficiency replacement motors are available. Also, if time is available, 
the purchase of surplus equipment may be considered. It would be 
advisable to maintain a subscription to at least one used or surplus 
equipment directory for that purpose. Also, there are many listings to 
be found on the internet.
The machinery maintenance person, during a facility visit, should 
gather information as to what procedures the shop uses to comply 
with his site or plant specifications. Obviously, a final sourcing deci-
sion should be made only after analyzing all available data and after 
the visit. The analysis can be made in form of a spreadsheet, using a

marking pen to highlight pertinent facts and color-coding prices by 
relative position. In essence, this rigorous procedure is similar to a 
formal bid-evaluation process and would rank the bidders by shop 
capacity, experience, reputation, recent performance, order backlog, 
or even labor union contract expiration date and the like.
OEM versus Non-OEM Compressor Rebuilding, Refurbishment, 
Upgrading, Conversion, Rerating, Revamping, Reapplication, 
and Remanufacture
Equipment users are inundated with reams of technical information 
concerning machinery in the purchasing phase. Yet, seldom do 
operators/users get an opportunity to ask some very basic questions 
that deserve to be answered to run their business, and even less 
information is available on rebuilding, refurbishment, upgrading, 
conversion, rerating, revamping, reapplication, and remanufacture.
When it comes to remanufacturing of reciprocating compressor, 
one should build up a working knowledge of what to expect before 
one enters into the contingent transaction. Ask the potential supplier 
the following questions: 
· Are the compressors remanufactured, or are they simply 
“rebuilt” or “repaired and repainted”? As we saw, completely 
remanufactured compressors are torn down to the smallest 
components and actually manufactured, so they should receive 
a similar guarantee to a new one. Ask about the manufacturer’s 
engineering quality standards and what type of technology is 
used for the remanufacturing process.
· What is included with the remanufactured compressors? Is 
the quoted price for the actual unit only, or does it include the 
driver, instrumentation, control panels, heat exchangers, and 
other necessary equipment? If one ends up having to pay the 
manufacturer extra for all of the auxiliary equipment, one 
may discover that one actually has to spend more for that 
company’s remanufactured compressors.
· How quickly can the remanufactured compressors be deliv-
ered? You should expect the delivery time for these remanufac-
tured products to be significantly less than new compressors. 
Manufactures who state that it will take longer to fill these 
types of orders should be closely examined.
· Will the API 618 standard be followed and if not, what would 
be the exceptions to that standard?
· What other industry standards will apply instead?
A formal and active quality system is mandatory for any repair, 
rebuilding, refurbishment, upgrading, conversion, rerating, revamping, 

244	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
and remanufacturing facility. This implies that an all-encompassing 
system to control all the activities of an organization is in place to ensure 
that what is shipped is exactly what was ordered. Included in such a 
system are the following functions as a minimum:
· Formal organization and control
· Control of documents
· Calibration of instruments
· Calibration of tools (e.g., torque wrenches)
· Training and qualification of personnel
· Product identification and traceability
· Corrective action
What We Have Learned
In the final analysis, the compressor owner, user, or purchaser of 
outside inspection, overhaul, repair, rebuild, refurbishment, upgrade, 
conversion, rerate, revamp, reapplication, and remanufacturing 
services should apply forethought. The same principles of prudent 
decision-making apply as are exercised on the acquisition of new 
compression equipment.
In a best-of-class facility, the various aspects of compressor perfor-
mance are intertwined and viewed as the responsibility of job func-
tions that include process/operations, mechanical/maintenance, and 
project/technical.
Continuity of effort and quality of work require development 
and adherence to written standards, checklists, and work procedures. 
A facility has to groom and develop personnel who are the “owners” 
of a compressor. These employees will have authority and account-
ability. They, and others, will benefit from reading, rereading, and 
carefully considering this text.

CHAPTER 18
Training Competent 
Compressor 
Engineers
T
o achieve real proficiency and high productivity, professional 
and craft employees require structured training. Plants and 
facilities that allow training to be haphazard and unstructured 
have very often become unprofitable. As their deficiencies were 
then laid bare, entire training departments have been dissolved and 
various elements of self-training or on-the-job training were chosen 
instead. But the challenges often remained. Sound implementation of 
meaningful and effective technical training requires forethought and 
consistency. Loosely defined and sporadically executed self-teaching 
routines are of little value; structure, repeatability, and value-adding 
are needed for good training.
Role Statement and “Phase One” of In-House Training
The beginning of structured training should be a well-focused, writ-
ten role statement which explains to both manager and managed their 
respective perceptions of the technical employee’s role. The compres-
sor professional or reliability technician may be encouraged to develop 
his or her own role statement and then ask for the supervisor’s or 
manager’s input or guidance. The last thing either party would want 
is a misunderstanding as to the perceived role.
Consider the mandate under which we operate. Are we parts 
changers or innovators? Are we expected to be fixers or improvers? A 
person who is expected to react to problems or anticipate problems? 
The role statement must, at least, allude to a training plan. The techni-
cal person and his or her supervisor should discuss both role state-
ment and training plan initially and, of course, during scheduled 
future performance reviews.

246	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
The detailed training plan may well be a separate document. A 
good one will give firm guidance and yet leave lots of room for indi-
vidual initiative. Its aim will be the achievement of proficiency in a 
technical skill or craft. As an adjunct, the employee is asked to keep a 
small computer file or notebook/folder with very brief notes on work 
performed and documenting the timelines of his or her achievements.
Nine out of ten times the resulting record of one’s work product 
will be of great value. Pity the professional who will say he or she was 
too busy working and didn’t find 2 minutes at the end of the week to 
write down what was accomplished.
Back to the training plan and, by way of example, a description of 
how technical training for a young engineer could be structured.
The Structure of Training
Let’s say your facility employs four maintenance/machinery engineers 
or reliability technicians. You could get them to engage in worthwhile 
self-training by obtaining subscriptions—many of them electronic and 
free of charge—to such periodicals as
· Chemical Engineering
· Chemical Processing
· Compressor Tech2
· Diesel Progress
· Hydrocarbon Processing
· Machine Design
· Machinery Lubrication
· Plant Services
· Power
· Sound and Vibration
· Turbomachinery International
· UPTIME Magazine
· World Pumps
and many others that were available in 2012 and might still be around 
in the coming decades. Each technical employee is considered a 
“professional-in-training”—a PiT. His or her name would be at the 
top of a routing or PiT distribution list for two or three different peri-
odicals. The designated professional would be required to screen the 
content of the monthly periodical(s) for relevant material, which 
takes about 5 minutes per month, in most instances.
We are careful to emphasize that an employee would not have to 
read the various articles, but would be expected to recognize from 

Tr a i n i n g  C o m p e t e n t  C o m p r e s s o r  E n g i n e e r s 	
247
headings or abstracts the present or possible future usefulness of 
the write-up. Electronic copies of relevant write-ups would have to be 
made or simply passed on to the other “professionals-in-training” on 
the “PiT” distribution form. Copies of appropriate articles would 
be filed so as to be accessible to all; the articles or write-ups would be 
under appropriate headings. The file system—electronic or paper-
based—might follow a simple, but logical numbering system to enable 
easy retrieval. This retrieval typically involves a straightforward, exten-
sively cross-referenced, PC-based software program.
The value of collecting interesting articles can go well beyond 
what is commonly perceived or anticipated. Think of finding an 
equipment-related article written years ago on a certain subject, or 
by a particular author. Perhaps you have never heard of the author, 
but once you find the article in your old files, you will know if the 
writer is a man or a woman. He or she certainly is a communicator, a 
researcher, a person who spent a certain effort to set himself or herself 
apart from the rest of the profession. You locate this professional via 
the Internet and explain that you have—right in front of you—his or 
her old article on, say, rules-of-thumb for butadiene compression. 
You explain that you’re a young engineer struggling with the concept 
of limiting Mach numbers on multicomponent heavy syngas and 
were wondering if this solid professional could please aim you in the 
right direction or spend 2 minutes explaining a certain issue.
Chances are that this author will respond very favorably and will 
be of immediate assistance. That’s networking at its best; it represents 
connecting with the talent of your most competent predecessors or 
peers. And think of it: All it took was saving an old article!
“Phase Two” Training: Digging Up the Facts
The second phase of training might be called the “dig-up-the-facts” 
phase. Decades ago, one large multinational petrochemical company 
called it “the shirt sleeve seminar phase” because the employee 
would have to roll up his or her sleeves and teach others about plant 
issues and things everyone needs to know for improved proficiency.
Each “PiT” would be asked to present such periodically scheduled 
briefings or information-sharing sessions to mechanical workforce per-
sonnel. These workforce members were ones assigned to shop or field 
(e.g., millwright) tasks. The PiT would make his or her 7 to 10 minute 
presentation at the conclusion of the ubiquitous plant safety meetings. 
Decades ago, these highly effective presentations were also described 
as technology briefings or information sharing sessions. They would 
deal with such topics as “How to Install Rolling Element Bearings,” 
“Proper Startup Procedures for Compressors and Drivers,” “Why Four 
Different Types of Couplings are Used at our Plant,” “When to Use 
Dry Gas Seals Instead of Oil Film Seals,” “Things that go Wrong on 
Centrifugal Compressors,” and so forth.

248	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
At one best-of-class facility, the abbreviated narrative of the PiT’s 
presentation was captured on a single, two-sided, standard size sheet. 
Illustrations were pictured on the same sheet. These two-pagers were 
then laminated in plastic, three-hole-punched, and handed out to 
each attendee at the end of the shirt sleeve seminar.
An image of one of this plant’s compressor couplings (Fig. 18.1) 
illustrates the point. It shows a diaphragm coupling fitted with a 
stretch-monitoring decal used at the PiT’s facility. Incorporating narra-
tive and sketches into a shirt sleeve seminar presentation educated the 
presenter, taught his or her audience, and served as a cornerstone for 
technology transfer to the next generation of engineers at this plant.
There are literally hundreds of worthwhile topics to research and 
discuss and disseminate. The “digging-up-the-facts” process would 
compel the presenter to do some homework instead of guesswork, 
communicating with vendors, other company staff and manufacturers 
instead of reinventing the wheel. The presenter might perhaps redis-
cover one or more of the many good technical textbooks which are 
generally available at a fraction of the cost of making even a single 
mistake. In the process of doing some diligent reading, the reader-
researcher would inevitably educate himself or herself. He or she 
would, at the same time, contribute significantly to the development 
of team spirit and the enhancement of mutual respect and coopera-
tion among the many job functions in the plant.
From here, the phased approach to training could move to in-
house courses taught by competent presenters with both analytical 
and practical knowledge in compressor maintenance and reliability 
improvement procedures, and then progress to well-defined, known-
to-be-relevant outside seminars or symposia.
And, by the way, if you think training is expensive, try calculating 
your costs without proper training. Without this training it will be 
impossible to retain talent and retain a loyal and motivated workforce.
Training Plans Beyond Phases I and II
Not to belabor the point, but reading is a hugely important part of 
training. That said, professional employees are encouraged to pur-
chase texts that spell out solutions to problems. If a $100 text describes 
how to solve a $100,000 problem, or if investing 2 hours on reading will 
avoid spending 200 man-hours on repairs, the benefits should be 
abundantly clear.
Books purchased with company funds are company property 
and must be made available to other professionals. Funding for the 
books comes from the employer; investing personal time in reading 
represents the employee’s share.
Attending on-site or off-site training courses is Phase III of the 
structured plan. Successful course attendance must be quantified

by achieving certification. After returning from such training, the 
employee highlights things learned in 250 words or less and shares 
the experience with the manager and other colleagues or interested 
parties. Consider this branching out the beginning of a life-long 
knowledge sharing and networking experience. For professionals 
with writing skills, this branching out then progresses to writing an 
article for one of the trade journals accessed in Phase I.
Putting the Training to Practice
There is a fitting conclusion to this topic; it is about engineers taking 
risks and communicating these risks to management. This text con-
tains much information on failure analysis and troubleshooting. Try 
not to explain only the problem, but proceed to outlining the solution 
to the problem. After the cause is determined, the results need to be 
communicated to management on what the problem is and what has 
to be done to fix it.
As engineers we like to limit our risks. A highly experienced 
colleague, general aviation pilot and mechanical engineer observed 
how this has served him well over the years.2 He does not recall doing 
things that were too risky, and he always had a couple of alternative 
plans in case something went wrong. His requests for a design 
modification were always supported with adequate calculations. 
He knew well that when engineers have performed a reasonable 
analysis, their arguments carry far more weight than the pleas of 
employees who are speculating on causes without bringing with them 
supporting data.3
There can be problems with the speculative approach; he learned 
these lessons early in his career and had to make adjustments. Again, 
the first observation is about risk: There is always risk involved in an 
engineering decision, and engineers cannot progress far in their 
careers if they are unwilling to take at least some risk.
Consider a large steam turbine driver vibrating slightly above 
normal levels with blade fouling thought to be the problem. Manage-
ment wants to know if the compressor train can run an additional 
week before a planned outage with that level of vibration. Your career 
will not be enhanced if you say it has to be shut down immediately, 
with no supporting data. Likewise, this is not the time to try your first 
attempt of on-line washing of a steam turbine while it is in operation. 
It’s risky business if you have neither experience nor operating guide-
lines for this procedure. However, this would be a good time to mon-
itor the vibration level, talk with the manufacturer and others who 
operate similar machines, and determine the risk in just monitoring 
the vibration levels. Defining at what level the turbine will have to be 
shut down will still require some risk, but now others have given 
their valuable input. Obviously there is much more involved, but this 

Tr a i n i n g  C o m p e t e n t  C o m p r e s s o r  E n g i n e e r s 	
251
illustrates the need for taking a certain amount of risk. You can expect 
to make errors, but these errors should not occur very early in your 
career and should also not occur without letup, one after the other. By 
the time the next error is made, you should have established a record 
of sound reasoning and mature judgment. Your occasional misjudg-
ments would be forgiven; your sound contributions would outweigh 
your infrequent misses.
Correctly communicating to management what has occurred 
and what needs to be done is so important to an engineer. It would 
be wonderful if engineers had the verbal ability of attorneys in 
presenting data to management. Attorneys’ jobs and training include 
making juries feel comfortable with what they are telling them, the 
decision that has to be made with the evidence, and data they have. 
Regrettably, many of us don’t have this kind of training. Fortunately, 
it can be learned by experience and watching other successful engi-
neers. Your company’s senior technical personnel didn’t get where 
they are by displaying a lack of communication skills or lots of poor 
judgment.
There are three things this source has found important when dis-
cussing work with senior management. The first two items are self-
explanatory, but the last will require an example.
	
1.	 Management does not like to hear bad news, so present posi-
tive plans.
	
2.	 Management does not want to hear a wish list of solutions, so 
present only your best and most cost-effective choice.
	
3.	 Management is not impressed with complex analyses or 
unfamiliar technical terms; therefore, the engineer must sim-
plify explanations of the cause, of the solution, and of the 
implementation so it can be understood and acted on.
The managers to whom you are presenting data and recommen-
dations may not be familiar with mechanical things or rotating 
machinery engineering; their expertise may be in completely differ-
ent fields. It is useful to adjust what you are presenting to suit your 
audience.
Suppose you are discussing the resonance of a structure and its 
failure. Now, as engineers we know resonance can be a highly dam-
aging vibration caused by exciting a structure’s natural frequency. 
Resonance could be clearly demonstrated by bringing a tuning fork 
to the meeting, striking it, and then showing the vibration behavior 
and sound emitted by the tuning fork. With no continued exciting 
input (meaning striking it again), the vibration dies out. However, 
with continued input and without a surrounding material damping 
the vibration, the tuning fork would fail in fatigue. The fatigue failure 
action could be demonstrated by bending a paper clip back and forth 
to show and explain what also happens in an industrial component. 

252	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
At any point you can stop bending, but some of the paper clip’s life 
has been used up.
When reviewing a technical presentation, the expert mentioned 
earlier always made a list of all the questions he thought might come 
up during the meeting and he researched them thoroughly. This 
allowed the best possible answers for the audiences with whom he 
met. His efforts were valued by those who recognized value. He man-
aged to teach those that were teachable. Whenever he ran into the few 
that are either unreasonable or simply not teachable, he was able to 
shrug them off. You, the reader, should feel free to copy his example 
in assessing risks and making your presentations to management.
What We Have Learned
· Training is a shared responsibility between employer and 
employee.
· The progress of training must be monitored by the employee’s 
supervisor and a management sponsor.
· Training progresses in phases and is an indispensable ingre-
dient to professional growth.
· Shirt sleeve seminars are a zero-cost means of training pre-
senters, audiences, and future generations of employees.
· Presentations delineating solutions enhance careers; presen-
tations that only describe problems are not helpful.
