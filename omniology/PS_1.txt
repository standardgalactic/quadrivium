KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
Problem Set Week 1
This problem set focuses on material covered in Lectures 1 and 2, so I recommend you to watch both
lectures and attempt Assignments 1 and 2 before submitting your answers. The deadline for completing
(and submitting) the problem set is Monday February 10 at 9:00 AM US-PST. Note that you can save
your entries as you work through the problems, and can change them at any time prior to submission,
but once you submit your answers no further changes are possible.
1. Is it possible for one of (φ ∧ψ) ∧θ and φ ∧(ψ ∧θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then the
associative property holds for conjunction.)
2. Is it possible for one of (φ ∨ψ) ∨θ and φ ∨(ψ ∨θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then the
associative property holds for disjunction.)
3. Is it possible for one of φ ∧(ψ ∨θ) and (φ ∧ψ) ∨(φ ∧θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then
the distributive property holds for conjunction across disjunction.)
4. Is it possible for one of φ ∨(ψ ∧θ) and (φ ∨ψ) ∧(φ ∨θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then
the distributive property holds for disjunction across conjunction.)
5. Is showing that the negation ¬φ is true equivalent to showing that φ is false?
6. Assuming you know nothing more about Alice, which of (a) – (e) is most likely? (Or does (f) hold?)
(a) Alice is a rock star and works in a bank.
(b) Alice is quiet and works in a bank.
(c) Alice is quiet and reserved and works in a bank.
(d) Alice is honest and works in a bank.
(e) Alice works in a bank.
(f) None of these is more or less likely.
7. Assuming you know nothing more about Alice, which of (a) – (e) is most likely? (Or does (f) hold?)
(a) Alice is a rock star or she works in a bank.
(b) Alice is quiet and works in a bank.
(c) Alice is a rock star.
(d) Alice is honest and works in a bank.
(e) Alice works in a bank.
(f) None of these is more or less likely.
8. Identify which of the following are true (where x denotes an arbitrary real number). If you do not
select a particular statement, the system will assume you think it is false.
(a) (x > 0) ∧(x ≤10) means 0 ≤x ≤10
(b) (x ≥0) ∧(x2 < 9) means 0 ≤x < 3
(c) (x ≥0) ∧(x ≤0) means x = 0
(d) There is no x for which (x < 4) ∧(x > 4)
(e) −5 ≤x ≤5 means x is at most 5 units from 0.
(f) −5 < x < 5 implies that x cannot be exactly 5 units from 0.

(g) (x ≥0) ∨(x < 0)
(h) (0 = 1) ∨(x2 ≥0)
(i) If (x > 0 ∨x < 0) then x ̸= 0.
(j) If x2 = 9 then (x = 3 ∨x = −3).
