Google Sites and Chrome For Dummies

Introduction
W
hen most people think of Google, the first thing that comes to mind 
is Internet search. Millions of people around the globe use Google to 
find information, learn something new, explore issues, or discover answers 
to tough questions. We assume that you’ve used Google Search before — or 
at least heard of it. If you want to find out how to be a Google Search expert, 
you’ve come to the wrong place. We’re interested in the other cool tools that 
Google creates beyond its powerful search box. Google Sites and Chrome are 
two such tools.
Just so you know upfront, Google Sites is a free online service that allows 
you to easily create Web sites with powerful wiki, file sharing, and collabora-
tion tools. Google Chrome is a free Web browser that you download to your 
computer and use to access Web sites, including your Google Sites. Google 
Sites & Chrome For Dummies aims to fill the void between what Google thinks 
is obvious and intuitive and what real people like you need to know to make 
the most of these two cool tools, including some not-so-obvious tweaks and 
features.
By the time you finish reading this book, we hope that you not only can 
master these two spiffy Google products, but also that your eyes are opened 
to a few of the more than 30 free products and services and how they mesh.
About This Book
This book is designed for all audiences. Whether you’re a soccer mom, a col-
lege professor, a movie exec, or a skater dude, we have something in here 
for you. This book helps you understand the tools you need to start building 
your new site and how to use them.
 
Although we do our best to make sure what you read in this book is accurate 
and up-to-date, we can’t make any promises. You see, Google likes to update 
things from time to time. Their products are called perpetual betas, meaning 
that the new bells and whistles discovered by the folks at Google often sneak 
into these products and change a thing or two. We just thought you 
should know.

Google Sites & Chrome For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
We divide this book into parts and chapters, organizing the chapters into six 
parts (which we describe in the following sections).
Part I: Getting Started with 
Google Sites and Chrome
Part I is the obvious place to start if you’re brand new to Google Sites and 
Chrome. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of Google Sites; we keep it 
short because we realize that if you have the great wisdom to pick up this 
book in the first place, you’re probably anxious to get started. Chapter 2 
gets you up and running with Chrome and highlights the browser’s basics. 
Chapter 3 runs through the process of setting up Google Sites for your busi-
ness, school, or organization using a Google Account or the Google Apps 
Team Edition. Finally, Chapter 4 lets you get your hands dirty and shows you 
the tools you need to start building your site.
Part II: Constructing and 
Sharing Your Google Site
Chapter 5 covers using the five basic templates to help organize information 
and files on your site. Chapter 6 goes into adding content from other Google 
Apps and the Web. When you’re feeling creative, look to Chapter 7 for tips 
on how to choose a new theme and adjust individual colors and graphics. 
Finally, Chapter 8 shows you how to add other users to the flurry.
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome
The two chapters in this part help you become a Chrome master. Chapter 9 
goes into depth on using the Omnibox to search the Web and find your way 
around Chrome’s tools. Chapter 10 gets technical, taking you through the 
settings and Chrome’s advanced features.

3
 Introduction
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme
We decided that there’s more to Sites than showing you the tools, so this part 
gives you three practical ideas, which we like to call schemes, for creating 
your site. Chapter 11 gives you ideas for a personal site. Chapter 12 throws 
out a college course scheme, and Chapter 13 helps you build a business wiki 
or intranet using Google Sites.
Part V: More Google Apps 
You Can’t Do Without
This part helps you expand your site by using the other Google Apps, including 
Google Docs, Google Calendar, Gmail, and Google Talk. Chapters 14 through 17 
introduce you to the Google Docs Home and discuss how to create and orga-
nize your online documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
Rounding out this part is Google Calendar in Chapter 18, Gmail in Chapter 19, 
and Google Talk and Contacts in Chapter 20. This part will have you proficient 
in Google’s communications tools in no time flat.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part begins by giving ten additional team scheme ideas in Chapter 21. 
Ending the book is Chapter 22, which suggests more Google Apps and services 
that you may want to explore. (This final chapter is one of our favorites.)
Conventions Used in This Book
To make using this book as easy and convenient as possible, we set up a few 
conventions:
 
✓ When we throw a new term at you, we place it in italics and define it.
 
✓ We place text that you actually type in bold.

4
Google Sites & Chrome For Dummies 
 
✓ Web site addresses and file names appear in a monospace font, like this: 
www.dummies.com. When part of a file name or Web site address varies 
(depending on what your Web site address is), we use italics to indicate 
a placeholder. For example, when you see http://sites.your
domain.com, you type the address of your domain name in place of 
yourdomain.com.
 
✓ When you need to use a menu to select a command, we use the com-
mand arrow (➪). For example, File➪Rename simply means that you 
should click the File menu and then choose the Rename command.
 
✓ When we show keyboard shortcuts, we place the plus sign (+) between 
keys. For example, to use the Cut command, press Ctrl+X. This means to 
press the Ctrl key and the X key at the same time.
Icons Used In This Book
From time to time, everyone gets distracted, starts to daydream, gets a little 
hungry, and quits paying attention. In a seemingly futile attempt to regain 
your attention from that long-overdue Snickers bar, we place icons through-
out the book. Each has its own deep-sleep preventive powers:
 
We mark paragraphs that we think you’ll find very useful with this icon. Tips 
show you shortcuts, timesavers, or something that’s otherwise worth noting. 
So, wake up and pay attention!
 
When you see this icon, beware. From experience, we know when you can 
easily make a mistake that may cause irreparable harm or damage to the 
Internet or national security. Well, maybe the Warning icon doesn’t point out 
something that dire, but you should still pay attention or risk losing data, 
time, and possibly hair (from pulling it out in frustration).
 
Rather than repeat ourselves (because maybe you didn’t pay attention the 
first time), we pop this icon in place. Commit the information to memory, and 
it can help you later.
 
Okay, we don’t use this icon unless we have to. When you see this icon, we’re 
flagging some information that’s more technical and nerdy than the rest of the 
text. You might find the information really cool and very interesting, despite 
being technical, so read it at your discretion.

 Introduction
Where to Go from Here
We’re not going to hold you back any longer. Any of the first four chapters is 
a great way to dive right in. Start finding out about Google Sites in Chapter 1, 
install Google Chrome in Chapter 2, sign up for a Google Account in Chapter 3, 
and begin building your new site in Chapter 4.

Google Sites & Chrome For Dummies 

Part I
Getting Started 
with Google Sites 
and Chrome

In this part . . .
G
oogle Sites changes how you share information on 
the Web and Google Chrome helps you do it at light-
ning speed. We know you’re anxious to dig in, so here’s 
where you can find how to get up and running with Google 
Sites and Chrome. Find out all about Google Sites, down-
load and install Chrome, sign up for Google Apps, and 
start building.
If you’ve previously signed up for a Google Apps or Gmail 
account and have already installed Chrome, skip ahead to 
Chapter 4 to start getting your feet wet.

Chapter 1
Befriending Google Sites
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing Google Sites
▶ Comparing Google Sites to other team apps
▶ Improving your life with Google Sites
▶ Deconstructing Google Sites
G
oogle Sites (http://sites.google.com) is a great online informa-
tion buddy. After all, buddies watch out for their friends — and Sites 
will help take care of you. With a little thought and a few clicks, Google Sites 
can help you, your friends, and your co-workers stay on top of projects, meet-
ings, classes, events, clubs, teams, causes, fundraisers, schedules, vacations, 
or anything else you can think of. Google Sites fills three related functions:
 
✓ Creates dynamic Web pages with a few clicks
 
✓ Constructs wikis for your users on any topic you may need
 
✓ Generates dynamic file sharing tools on the fly
In this chapter (and this book), we show how Google Sites can be very help-
ful to you, what that word wiki means, and how Google’s many online apps 
and gadgets can make your life much simpler. You see how Sites compares to 
all the other team collaboration tools out there so you can understand why 
picking Google Sites is as easy as making a mouse click.
Now for the best part: Google Sites is a free component of Google Apps, along 
with Gmail, Calendar, and Docs. As with these other services, you don’t need 
programming skills, and you don’t need any complicated Web design soft-
ware beyond a Web browser, such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Firefox.
What You Should Know Before You Start
Before you can use Google Sites, you must first have a Google Account or 
Google Apps account. A Google Account gives you access to a whole bunch 
of other free Google online services, such as Google Calendar (http://

10
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
calendar.google.com), where you can track your appointments and 
events, Blogger (www.blogger.com), which lets you create your own blog, 
Picasa Web Albums (www.picasa.com), where you can share your photos 
online, and Google Docs (http://docs.google.com). If you don’t have an 
account, Chapter 3 shows you how to sign up.
 
Like many other services offered by Google, Sites is a perpetual beta. This 
means that the clever Google engineers are always improving the way Sites 
works by adding new features and changing ones that aren’t as helpful. If the 
screen looks somewhat different from the figures that you see in this book, it’s 
okay. The same basic idea should still apply.
To help you understand all that Google Sites has to offer, let us introduce you 
to three key definitions: Web pages, wikis, and file sharing.
Web pages
A Web page is a file that can be viewed by others in a Web browser. A page 
can include written text, images, links to other pages, videos, and so on. One 
way you can use Google Sites is to create a Web page with information you 
want to share with the world. An example of this type of site is shown in 
Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Use Google 
Sites to 
create a 
Web page.
 

11
 Chapter 1: Befriending Google Sites
In addition to helping you include your text and images, Google Sites gives 
you access to hundreds of gadgets that you can add to your page. Gadgets 
are like mini Web pages that show specific information, such as weather, 
news headlines, calendar events, videos, communication tools, and more. We 
talk about gadgets in depth in Chapter 6.
Wikis
A wiki is a Web page that anyone can add to or edit. Wiki is a Hawaiian word 
that means quick, and wiki sites are unique because they can be created, 
edited, and saved very quickly from within your Web browser. They’re also 
very helpful because every member of your group or team needs to go to 
only one place to find the latest information.
Wikis are becoming more and more popular as companies, organizations, 
teams, and families work to share information and learn the unique things 
that people know. In any workplace, employees generally have more collec-
tive knowledge about how a company operates than the human resources 
director or company president. By using a wiki, all employees can share their 
knowledge with everyone else. The human resources team can then edit and 
organize it all.
How does a wiki work in Google Sites? Everyone who has the ability to edit 
a site will see the Create New Page and Edit Page buttons at the top of the 
page. When anyone in your group clicks the Edit Page button, they can begin 
making changes to the page by adding a graphic or paragraph. When they 
are done, all they have to do is click the Save button at the top and the page 
updates instantly.
If you already have a site and you want to start editing your wiki, head over 
to Chapter 4. We’ve also put together a few ideas for creating a wiki for your 
work, family, class, or group in Part IV.
File sharing
A very important feature that goes hand in hand with wikis is the ability to 
keep your team’s files in a central location. File sharing lets members of your 
team upload any type of file, such as a presentation or video, so everyone 
else can find it later. When you upload a file, you send it from your computer 
to a Web site. Then other people can download the file by saving it from the 
Web site to their computer.

12
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
Google Sites makes it easy to share files using the File Sharing page template, 
as shown in Figure 1-2. Similar to a editing a wiki page, you add and delete 
files by clicking the buttons that appear on a File Cabinet page. Additionally, 
Google Sites keeps track of multiple versions of your files, so if someone 
makes a change to a file and uploads the new one, you see both the new ver-
sion and the old one.
To find more about how to use the File Cabinet in Google Sites, check out 
Chapter 5.
 
Figure 1-2: 
File 
sharing 
puts all 
of your 
important 
documents 
in one 
place.
 
Define: Wikipedia
The new Internet (also known as Web 2.0) is 
all about sharing information. Instead of simply 
connecting computers and services, the new 
Internet connects people and ideas. Look 
at the most famous wiki: Wikipedia (www.
wikipedia.org). When this book was 
published, there were 2,472,151 articles in 
English, contributed by more than 7.5 mil-
lion different users, covering everything from 
important historical events to pop culture, cal-
culus proofs, and book summaries. Compare 
that to the meager 120,000 articles found in 
the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is one of 
the most comprehensive traditional sources. 
There’s no doubt that connecting people with 
wikis gives everyone access to more informa-
tion and helps people feel that they are making 
a contribution to the world’s knowledge.

 Chapter 1: Befriending Google Sites
Comparing Google Sites 
to Other Team Sites
We’re assuming that because you’re reading this book, you’re leaning toward 
using Google Sites. In case you’re curious, however, here’s how the others 
compare.
Microsoft Office Live Workspace
Microsoft Office Live Workspace (http://workspace.officelive.com) — a 
free service that’s probably the most similar to Sites — offers users the ability 
to share files easily and to comment on projects, as shown in Figure 1-3. Unlike 
Sites, however, there’s no Web page tool, so creating a wiki site isn’t part of the 
package.
The main advantage to using Office Live Workspace is that if you use 
Microsoft Office, you can download a plug-in that gives you easy access to 
save your Office documents directly to the site. Office Live’s big brothers, 
Groove and SharePoint, offer additional features for larger companies but 
also require expensive servers and software.
To use Office Live Workspace, you need a Windows Live ID and password, 
which you can get free at http://home.live.com.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Microsoft 
Office Live 
Workspace 
makes it 
easy to 
share files.

Blackboard and Moodle
Blackboard (www.blackboard.com) and Moodle (www.moodle.org) are 
both great tools for teachers to keep track of classes, handouts, quizzes, and 
grades. (Moodle is shown in Figure 1-4.) They provide tools for pretty much 
any aspect of your class needs. But they’re also very complex and require 
extensive training every time a new semester rolls around.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Moodle 
has more 
classroom 
features, 
such as 
quizzes and 
gradebooks.
 
Blackboard and Moodle both require servers to run on, and someone to main-
tain them. You also have to pay a license fee for Blackboard. If your school 
already uses either one, they have gone ahead and taken care of the cost.
In cases where you don’t need all the bells and whistles or if you use other 
publisher-provided tools, Google Sites gives you the basics to share all of 
your classroom information with the students in your class. For an example 
of using Google Sites for a classroom, see Chapter 12.
Acrobat
Adobe takes a slightly different approach to sharing files. They offer five ser-
vices through their Web site, www.acrobat.com, which allow you to create 
and share individual files with others:

15
 Chapter 1: Befriending Google Sites
 
✓ Buzzword is an online word processor similar to Google Docs (see 
Chapter 15).
 
✓ ConnectNow lets you host online conferences and share your screen 
over the Internet.
 
✓ Create PDF is a tool to transform your documents into portable 
document format.
 
✓ Share lets you upload and invite others to see your documents.
 
✓ My Files gives you a place to keep your files and access them from 
anywhere.
Instead of using a wiki-like interface, Acrobat gives you the option to enter 
the e-mail addresses of your team members so they can keep track of your 
files. Although this is useful for individual documents, it makes running a 
whole team project a little difficult because every time you want to share a 
file, you have to remember the addresses of everyone on your team. Still, the 
black interface is very easy to use and is just plain cool.
Why Google Sites Is the 
Right Way to Do Things
We mention in the previous section that Google Sites incorporates the best 
aspects of Web page, wiki, and file sharing technology into an easy-to-use 
online tool. But choosing Google Sites is about more than playing with a shiny 
new service — it’s also about saving you time and money. In this section, we 
share with you our two cents, just in case you’re not already convinced that 
Sites is the way to go.
Simplifying your life
The first thing you notice with Google Sites is Google’s trademark simplicity. 
Although other services may have more bells and whistles, Google Sites keeps 
it simple and gives you the features you need to get your work done without 
making you master a whole new complicated set of tools and features.
With Google Sites, you can focus more on coordinating group activities to 
accomplish your tasks and less on figuring out all the extra stuff. Plus, you 
get all the training you need from this book. Now that’s simple!

16
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
Saving money
Google Sites is free. Talk about saving money. You don’t have to invest in 
expensive servers and software. All you need is an Internet connection and a 
Web browser, either of which you could get free at your public library, if you 
wanted.
All of your pages, wikis, and files are hosted for free, along with your other 
Google services. The exception, of course, is if you use Google Apps Premier 
Edition (www.google.com/apps), but in that case, your organization is 
really paying for the support. (Google Apps Premier Edition, along with all 
other editions of Google Apps, is discussed in the next section.)
 
Google can provide these services free because of the money they make on 
Internet search advertising. Next time you use Google Search, look for the 
sponsored links to the right of your results. That’s what pays the engineers to 
create these high-quality tools.
How Google Sites Fits with 
the Other Google Apps
Google Apps (www.google.com/apps) is made up of five fully-functioning 
online applications: Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Talk, and Sites. Communicating 
with other people on the Internet is a snap with Gmail and Talk, and collabo-
ration is simple with Calendar, Docs, and Sites. Each of these apps are fully 
functioning programs that allow you to do your work, such as e-mail and 
word processing, from any Web browser, instead of relying on your comput-
er’s other installed software. Additionally, you can quickly access informa-
tion you store online by using mini versions of the apps called gadgets. There 
are different editions of the whole Google Apps package, depending on your 
organization and needs. These include:
 
✓ Team Edition: If you already have a school or work e-mail address, this 
edition adds Calendar, Docs, Talk, and Sites to the mix. Plus, you can 
instantly start connecting with other users in your organization that 
have already signed up. (Click the link for Coworkers or Classmates.)
 
✓ Standard Edition: If your group or business is just starting out or is 
switching from another service, such as Outlook, this free edition of 
Google Apps lets you use all five services with your existing domain 
name with minimal e-mail advertisements. (Click the Business IT 
Managers link, click the See Details and Sign Up button, and then click 
Compare to Standard Edition)

17
 Chapter 1: Befriending Google Sites
 
✓ Premier Edition: This edition costs $50 per user per year, but adds 
more functionality and security than Standard Edition, more storage 
space, provides 24/7 support, and gets rid of the ads. (Click the Business 
IT Managers link.)
 
✓ Education Edition. This is just like Premier Edition, but free for univer-
sities, schools, and other nonprofit organizations. (Click the School IT 
Managers link.)
These apps just so happen to play nice with each other, too, by allowing 
you to easily share information from one app with another. Some of the fea-
tures we talk about in this book include alerts, which are sent to your e-mail 
account, and embedded calendars, which help your team members know 
what’s coming up.
In the next few sections, we give you a taste of what each of the other apps 
does and provide examples of how you can include them in your sites by using 
gadgets. You can find more about how to use these apps individually in Part V.
Calendar
Google Calendar (http://calendar.google.com) keeps track of your 
events. You can easily add new calendar items and access them from any-
where, including your BlackBerry or iPhone. In Calendar, you can create 
separate calendars for your personal and team-related events and share 
them with other members of your team.
Displaying your team calendar is easy in Google Sites, thanks to the Calendar 
gadget. From your site, everyone can quickly find upcoming events or follow 
up on meetings that happened. Figure 1-5 shows an agenda for a class, using 
the Calendar gadget.
Skip to Chapter 14 to begin coordinating schedules.
Docs
Create, edit, and store documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online 
with Google Docs (http://docs.google.com). Google Docs features a 
surprisingly powerful word processor, spreadsheet editor, and presentations 
app that provide most of the tools you need. One of the cool things about 
Docs is that you can share your documents with other team members and 
work on them at the same time. This way, any changes you make are auto-
matically updated and everyone else can see them right away.

It should be no surprise, then, that you can include your docs on Google 
Sites, too. Beyond simply creating links to your individual docs, Google Sites 
uses gadgets to place the content of your docs directly on your pages, as 
shown in Figure 1-6. For example, use the Spreadsheet gadget to include a list 
you have stored in a spreadsheet or the Presentation gadget to play an ani-
mated slideshow of a quarterly report.
To find out more about Google Docs, flip to Chapter 15 and begin exploring 
the Google Docs Home. Chapters 16, 17, and 18 cover the basics for word 
processing, spreadsheets, and presentations, respectively.
Gmail
Gmail (www.gmail.com) is Google’s solution to e-mail. It features a simple 
interface and a lot of cool innovations, such as conversations and labels. 
You can also use Gmail with your favorite e-mail program, such as Outlook 
or Thunderbird. Unlike other free e-mail services, which feature annoying 
graphical ads, Gmail uses text ads that are less bothersome.

With Google Apps, Gmail works with your group’s domain name. This means 
that your e-mail can still be you@yourcompany.com, but you can use Gmail’s 
intuitive interface and have your e-mail hosted by Google.
Google Sites uses e-mail notifications to let your group or team members 
know when something changes on your site. When a change is made to a 
page, Google Sites sends subscribers an e-mail showing exactly what changes 
were made and gives you a link to open that page directly.
See Chapter 19 to find out more about Gmail.
Talk
When e-mail simply isn’t fast enough, use Google Talk (http://talk.
google.com). Talk is a really cool instant messaging app that you can either 
download to your computer or run directly from your site. If you’re using 
Google Apps Team Edition, your co-workers or fellow students are automati-
cally added to your contact list, similar to Figure 1-7. When one of your con-
tacts is online (they’ll have a green dot next to their name), simply click their 
name and start telling them why they’re the best member of your team. When 
you chat with more that one person, each conversation shows as a tab along 
the top of the Talk gadget.

Getting to Know Chrome
In This Chapter
▶ Downloading and installing Google Chrome
▶ Running Chrome for the first time
▶ Finding your way around Chrome
▶ Using tabs and the Omnibox
W
e’re going out on a limb here, but if you’re reading this book, we’re 
guessing you’re more than just a little familiar with the Internet. In 
your Internet experience, you’ve no doubt noticed a whole host of new Web 
services, including wikis, online apps, and social networking, which are 
changing how we interact with people and information. This new thinking 
and set of new tools and services is called Web 2.0, and it’s light years ahead 
of the first Web pages of simple text and links. Google thinks it’s time for your 
browser to evolve, too.
The browser is your window to all the information that is created and shared 
by Web 2.0 services, including Google Sites. Although other browsers have 
become bulky and slow, Google Chrome provides a fresh, clean view of your 
favorite sites and services and delivers them fast and efficiently, due to its 
optimized design.
In this chapter, you get to know Chrome a little better. You find out how to 
download and install the new Chrome browser. We also show you where all 
the important buttons and tools are. Part III of this book digs deeper into the 
settings and features of this lightning-fast browser, so when you’re comfort-
able, skip ahead to check it out.
Choosing Google Chrome
You have many browser choices out there. If you’re running Windows, you 
have likely used Internet Explorer to see the world. If you have a Mac, your 
Web is powered by Safari. Although both of these browsers do a fine job of 
displaying your pages and running your apps, there’s a better way. Chrome, 

22
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
shown in Figure 2-1, was built from the ground up as a browser for Web 2.0. 
The developers focused specifically on speed, security, and reliability 
throughout the design process. Plus, Chrome taps into Google Search to 
make finding information a breeze. You see what we mean in this section.
 
Figure 2-1:

Chrome’s 
impressive 
interface.
 
Using a faster browser
Internet apps use technology that is much more advanced than simple 
HTML. Older browsers started simple and kept adding new capabilities. 
Over time, they’ve become bulky and slow because each app has to load 
before the browser can load. Who has time to wait for browser windows 
to open?
Chrome takes advantage of new technology that runs many of these 
advanced features without using as much computer memory as other older 
browsers. This means that Chrome starts immediately after you open it and 
new tabs appear just as quickly. Additionally, many online apps, including 
Gmail and Google Sites, run much faster in Chrome than in other browsers. 
Try it and you’ll see what we mean.
 
If you decide Chrome isn’t for you, our feelings won’t be hurt. You can always 
go back to Internet Explorer, Safari, or whatever other browser you’re used 
to. However, it’s going to take a lot of effort to pry us away from Chrome.

23
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Chrome
Making the most of Google Search
The Internet is built around search. Whether you’re reviewing products, 
mastering a new medical procedure, or looking for that special e-mail 
message, search is indispensable. That’s why Chrome builds in Google 
Search technology everywhere from finding Web sites to locating bookmarks 
to checking your browsing history.
One of the unique features of Chrome is the Omnibox, as shown in Figure 2-2. 
The Omnibox combines the browser’s address bar, search bar, and search 
from other Web sites into one location. Whether you know the address or 
want Google to find it, the Omnibox takes care of you. You find out more 
about the Omnibox later in this chapter.
 
Believe it or not, several other search services are out there that you can use 
in place of Google, including Yahoo!, Live Search, AOL, and more. When you 
open Chrome the first time, you have the option to choose Google Search or 
some other service. You can change it at any time using the Options screen, 
which we cover in Chapter 10.
Browser Wars I & II
In the beginning (around AD 1994) there was 
Mosaic, a small, primitive HTML browser that 
first popularized the Web. Mosaic was created 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
by a bunch of hotshot programmers, many of 
whom moved to Silicon Valley and created the 
next big breakthrough, a much faster browser 
forever remembered as simply Netscape. 
Netscape Navigator was the browser of choice 
until the late ’90s when Microsoft released 
Internet Explorer (IE was first licensed from 
much of the lingering Mosaic code) and the first 
browser war ensued.
With a good initial product and its fabled mar-
keting might, Microsoft captured more and 
more users and pulled ahead as the mainstream 
Internet browser. Netscape slowly faded into 
history. While IE began to dominate, however, it 
added everything and the kitchen sink. The 
browser bogged down and broke down more 
than many users could tolerate.
As time went on, the Web was supercharged 
with 2.0 apps. More and more ’Net apps, such 
as messaging, voice apps, streaming video, 
chat, social networking, and online word pro-
cessing became popular. With Web 2.0, having 
a fast, reliable Web browser has become more 
important than ever. In a response to changing 
needs, a number of alternative browsers have 
come out to challenge IE. A second browser 
war is now in full force. This time, Internet 
Explorer faces stiff competition from Apple 
Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Google 
Chrome. The focus of these browsers is a return 
to an efficient, secure, and fast browser that 
can get the most out of Web 2.0 apps. Regardless 
of who wins the next browser skirmish, users 
are the ultimate winners with a better way to 
view and use the Web.

Keeping your computer safe
Chrome even protects you from people who would steal your information 
or install bad software onto your computer. Every time you use it, Chrome 
automatically downloads a list of Web sites that Google knows are bad. 
They either try to get you to give up your personal information or load soft-
ware to track your behavior. Whenever you come across a bad site, Google 
blocks the screen and helps you navigate away. If you’re certain the site is 
legitimate, there’s an option to continue at your own risk.
 
Scammers like to make you think you’re visiting a popular site, such as your 
bank or eBay. Although Chrome does its best to protect you from these sites, 
do not enter personal information, such as PINs or Social Security numbers, 
on a site that you visit from an e-mail link. When in doubt, visit the site directly 
(by typing www.ebay.com, for example) and log in, or call the organization to 
see whether the request is valid.
With the Omnibox, you have a handful of ways to tell whether a site is legiti-
mate. In the Omnibox, the domain name of the site you’re visiting appears 
in black letters and the rest of the long address is gray. If you’re visiting an 
eBay page, make sure that the address shows www.ebay.com and not some 
other address. When you’re on a secure site, the Omnibox is yellow and a 
lock icon appears on the right side. You’ll also notice that the “https” letters 
appear in green.
Downloading and Installing Chrome
Now that you’ve read a few reasons why we feel Chrome is better than other 
browsers, it’s time to dig in and start using it. This section helps you get up 
and running in no time flat.
Getting Chrome onto your computer takes just a few clicks. If you’re click 
happy, follow Steps 1 and 2 below and click the buttons that make sense. 
Chrome installs in a matter of seconds. Otherwise, here are detailed steps to 
help you set up Chrome just how you want.

25
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Chrome
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to www.google.com/chrome.
 
2. Click the blue Download Google Chrome button on the right side of 
the screen.
 
 The Google Chrome Terms of Service screen appears, showing a bunch 
of legalese text. Optionally, you can grab your lawyer and try to make 
sense of it.
 
3. (Optional) If you want to help Google create better features, click the 
Optional check box.
 
 If you choose this check box, Chrome lets Google know which search 
suggestions you’ve chosen and which Web pages cause your browser 
to crash.
 
4. Click the Accept and Install button.
 
5. In the download window that appears, click Run or Open. If another 
window appears, click Run one more time.

Click the Keep Google button if you plan to use Google for your 
searches, otherwise click the Change Search Engine button. In the 
Options screen that appears, choose your preferred search engine from 
the drop-down list to the right of Default Search.
Finding Your Way around Chrome
Remember we said Chrome was fast? You’ll notice how fast the window and 
new tabs appear. The Google engineers were thinking of speed when they 
built Chrome.
Chrome’s interface is designed to be minimal (refer to Figure 2-1). There’s no 
menu bar, no random toolbars, and even the bookmarks only appear on the 
first page by default. Remember that when you use Chrome, your focus 
should be the Internet, not the browser.
In this section, we help you make the most of tabs, the New Tab page, and 
the Omnibox. When you’re ready to dig deeper, see Chapters 9 and 10.

27
 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Chrome
Discovering tabs
In Chrome, tabs appear along the top of the window, like folders in a file 
drawer. Add a new tab by clicking the + (plus sign) button to the right of the 
set of tabs. Close a tab by clicking the small X on the right edge of that tab. If 
only one tab is open and you click the X, Chrome will close completely.
Each tab has its own toolbar, complete with navigation buttons and 
Omnibox, as shown in Figure 2-4. Here’s what each button does, from left 
to right:
Figure 2-4:

keep your

✓ Back (left arrow): Return to the last page you visited.
 
✓ Forward (right arrow): Go forward after you’ve gone to a previous page.
 
✓ Reload (circular arrow): Refresh the current page. This is helpful when 
you’re following a breaking news story or the page doesn’t display 
correctly.
 
✓ Bookmark (star): Add the current page to your list of bookmarks. Even 
though a bookmark is added automatically, a popup window appears 
where you can rename or organize your bookmarks. Chapter 9 has more 
info on bookmarks.
 
✓ Omnibox: Enter your URL or search term here, and then click the Go 
button.
 
✓ Go (right-facing triangle): Load the address or search term found in the 
Omnibox.
 
✓ Page menu: Access common features, such as Copy/Paste or Print.
 
✓ Tools menu: Adjust settings or view your browsing history and down-
loads.
Keeping tabs (no pun intended) on your Internet experience can be a little 
daunting. While you browse the Internet, chances are you end up with a 
pile of browser windows that clutter your computer desktop. All the open 

28
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
windows slow down your computer and make it difficult to switch to other 
programs you may be using. Tabs help alleviate that pain by grouping all of 
your browser windows into one pane.
 
If you’re used to opening a new browser window each time, start thinking 
tabs, not windows. For those of you who have the Ctrl+N keyboard shortcut 
down pat, we’d like to suggest an alternative: Ctrl+T, which creates a new tab. 
As a bonus, use Ctrl+Tab to cycle through your tabs and Alt+Tab (or Cmd+Tab 
for you Mac users out there) to flip through your windows.
New Tab page
Where do you go when you open your browser? If you’re like most people, 
you either head to a particular site that you have in mind or want to search 
the Web for some information. If you’re like us, you probably have a handful 
of Web sites you visit every day. Well, forget using a traditional Home page; 
the New Tab page can become your new best friend for finding your way 
easily on the Web.
Every time you start Chrome or open a new tab, the New Tab page loads, 
revealing all sorts of goodies to enhance your browsing experience. The New 
Tab page gives you quick access to pages that you’re likely to visit. Of 
course, you can always just start typing in the Omnibox. Here’s a highlight of 
each feature of the New Tab page, which you can also see in Figure 2-5.

 Chapter 2: Getting to Know Chrome
 
✓ Bookmarks bar: Bookmarks to your favorite pages appear in the blue 
bar, just below the toolbar. When your bookmarks don’t all fit, you can 
find them by clicking the Other Bookmarks button on the right side of 
the bar.
 
✓ Most Visited: Whether it’s a blog, your social network, or e-mail, the 
pages you visit most appear here with little screenshots, so you have a 
pretty good idea of where you’re headed. This section automatically 
changes as your taste does, based on the number of times you’ve visited 
that page. Click the Show Full History link at the bottom of the screen to 
see where you’ve been.
 
✓ Searches: Quickly find a site in your history or other sites by using the 
Searches box. Searches will even find text on the page if you don’t 
remember the site name.
 
✓ Recent Bookmarks: For bookmark junkies (you know who you are), look 
here for the latest additions to your treasure trove. Those bookmarks 
will likely appear on your Bookmarks bar, too.
 
✓ Recently Closed Tabs: Accidentally close a tab that you didn’t want to? 
When you open a new tab in the same window, your closed tabs appear. 
Click the title and it will reappear, complete with that tab’s browsing 
history, so you can go backward and forward right where you left off.
 
If you really want to see your traditional Home page instead of the New Tab 
page when you start Chrome, click the Tools menu and choose Options. In the 
Google Chrome Options screen that appears, look for the Home Page section 
and select the radio button next to Open This Page. Type your normal Home 
page address in the box to the right and then click the Close button. Note: The 
New Tab page still loads on all new tabs.
Unleashing the Omnibox
What could be better than a feature called the Omnibox? The Omnibox sits 
there quietly, waiting to spring into action and take you where you want to go 
on the Internet. Here are a few reasons why we think the Chrome Omnibox 
rocks and how you can use it to become a browsing master.
 
✓ You can use it to load a site. The Omnibox is an address bar. Type the 
URL of the site you want to visit, such as http://sites.google.com, and 
you’re taken there instantly. When you start typing in the Omnibox, not 
only does the URL or search term appear, but you also see suggestions 
for searches, popular pages, recent pages you’ve visited, bookmarks, 
and more. Look back at Figure 2-2 to see the Omnibox in action.

30
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
 
✓ You can use it to activate a search on other sites. You can also use the 
Omnibox to search other sites, such as Amazon.com or Wikipedia. First, 
you have to activate the site, and then you can search the site using 
Omnibox. Here’s how:
 
1. To activate search on a site, first visit the main page and perform 
a simple search.
 
 For example, go to www.amazon.com and search for Google 
Apps For Dummies. From now on, you can search the whole 
Amazon.com site using Omnibox. A search box for your site will 
also appear in the Searches section of the New Tab page.
 
2. Enter the site you want to search into the Omnibox.
 
 Type the address of the site you want to search, such as Amazon.
com. If your site is activated, you see the Press Tab to Search 
Amazon.com on the right side of the Omnibox, as shown in 
Figure 2-6.
 
3. Press Tab on your keyboard and then enter your search term in 
the Omnibox.
 
 The site address changes to a blue Search yoursite.com bar.
 
4. Click the Go button to the right of the Omnibox or press Enter on 
your keyboard.
 
 The results for your search appear directly in the browser window.
Figure 2-6:
Use the 
Omnibox 
to search 
other sites.
 
When you have the Omnibox down pat, you’re ready to enjoy the Internet 
fully. There’s a lot more you can do with Google Chrome. Be sure to check 
out Chapters 9 and 10 for more info.

Signing Up for Google Apps and 
Getting Your Team Online
In This Chapter:

▶ Choosing the right version of Google Apps
▶ Using the dashboard
▶ Inviting others to join Google Apps
▶ Customizing Apps to fit your taste 
G
oogle Sites isn’t going to sit there and do everything for you, although 
we sometimes wish it did. No, you have to get out there and sign up for 
an account with Google. A Google Account gives you access to Google Sites, 
as well as to other services such as Google Health (www.google.com/
health) where you can track your medical history online, and iGoogle (www.
google.com/ig) which keeps your e-mail, news, and so on, all on one page. 
Don’t worry, though; it isn’t difficult at all to sign up for an account, unless, 
like us, you have a hard time reading garbled letters — you see what we 
mean in a few pages.
You can choose from two types of accounts: a Google account and a Google 
Apps account. We know they sound awfully similar, but there really is a differ-
ence in what each one does, and we want to make sure that you choose the 
best one for you. Here’s a quick look at the two:
 
✓ Google Account: This type of account is what the typical home user 
would choose, especially if that user isn’t associated with a company, 
organization, or school. You can use your regular, tried-and-true e-mail 
address as your Google Account login, although we personally like Gmail 
and recommend you sign up for it, too. A Google account also lets you 
create personalized maps and YouTube channels, upload photos, and 
access other really cool tools and services.

32
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
 
✓ Google Apps account: If you work for a company or are part of a school, 
and you use e-mail provided by your organization, a Google Apps 
account is the way to go. Your Google Apps account connects you 
automatically with other people in your organization, assuming they 
share the same domain name (that’s the part of your e-mail address 
after the @ sign). This connection makes it really easy to share Sites, 
Calendars, and Docs. You can also chat right away with your colleagues 
because you share the same contacts list.
Creating a Google Account
You’re just moments away from using Google Sites and all the other great 
services and tools offered by Google. Before you sign up for a new Google 
account, check to make sure that you don’t have an account already. Open 
your Web browser and navigate to http://sites.google.com. If you 
don’t have an account or haven’t signed in, your screen should look similar 
to Figure 3-1. On the other hand, if you see a list of sites or the option to 
choose your e-mail address, you likely already have an account. Google will 
double-check your address when you sign up.
Figure 3-1:
Check to 
see whether 
you have 
a Google 
Account.
 
There are two ways to sign up for a regular Google account, depending on 
what else you want to do with it. To use your existing e-mail address, read 
the first section below. If you don’t have an e-mail account (we know there 
are some of you out there) or if you want to make the switch to Gmail, follow 
the instructions under “Signing up for a Google account using Gmail” later in 
this section. When you sign up for Gmail, a Google Account is automatically 
created using your new Gmail address.
 
After you’ve signed up for a Google account, be sure to check out all the other 
cool stuff Google offers at www.google.com/options. To get a sneak peek 
at some of our favorites, check out Chapter 21.

33
 Chapter 3: Signing Up for Google Apps and Getting Your Team Online
After you create a Google account, you have to sign in only once to access all 
the other Google services. You just have to remember your e-mail address 
and password the first time you log in after you open your Web browser.
Signing up for a Google account using 
your existing e-mail address
Creating an account with your existing e-mail address is simple. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to http://sites.google.com (you 
can also go to www.google.com/accounts to create a new account).
 
 Your screen should look similar to Figure 3-1.
 
2. Click the Get Started link on the right side of the page below the 
login box.
 
 In the textbox that appears, enter your e-mail address and click the Go 
button that appears on the right. After Google has made sure that your 
account doesn’t already exist, click the Sign Up for a Google Account 
link that appears below the textbox. You should see a screen that looks 
like Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Create a 
Google 
account 
using your 
e-mail 
address.
 
 
3. In the textboxes on the Create an Account screen, enter your e-mail 
address and create a password with at least eight characters. From 
the Location list, choose your country, and then enter the scrambled 
letters in the Word Verification box.

34
Par t I: Get ting Star ted with Google Sites and Chrome
 
 If you can’t read the letters, try reloading the page to get a new image, 
or click the wheelchair icon to the right of the box to hear the letters 
spoken. Deciphering these letters is probably the hardest part of 
signing up.
 
 The Password Strength bar on the right tells you whether your pass-
word is strong enough. A strong password usually has a mix of letters, 
numbers, and special characters, such as # or ^. For tips on how to 
choose a secure password, click the Password Strength link.
 
4. Read the Terms of Service. If they look good to you and you’re ready 
to create your account, click the I Accept. Create My Account button 
at the bottom of the page.
 
 An e-mail is sent to your e-mail account to verify that you actually 
own it.
 
5. Log into your e-mail and look for a new message from Google titled 
“Google Email Verification.”. Click the long cryptic-looking link in 
that e-mail to verify your account.
 
 The screen that appears thanks you for verifying your account. Note: 
Depending on your e-mail service, you may need to click a button at the 
top of the message to enable the link. You can also copy and paste the 
address in a new browser window if that doesn’t work.
Congratulations! You now have an official Google account! When you’re ready 
to begin creating a new site, return to http://sites.google.com in your 
browser and skip ahead to Chapter 4 for some helpful pointers.
Signing up for a Google 
account using Gmail
So you need an e-mail address, huh? Or are you tired of your old one and 
want to switch to a shiny new one? Either way, we think that Gmail is the way 
to go and in this section we help you get your very own address . As an 
added bonus, your Gmail address will act as your login for your new Google 
account. Here are five easy steps to create your Gmail/Google account:
 
1. Open your Web browser and navigate to www.gmail.com.
 
 Your screen should look like Figure 3-3.
 
2. Click the Sign Up For Gmail link on the right side of the screen, below 
the Sign In box.
 
 To find out more about Gmail’s features, click the About Gmail and New 
Features! link in the bottom-right corner of the screen (shown in Figure 
3-3) before you sign up. You can also find out how to become a Gmail 
master by reading Chapter 19 of this book.

personal information.
 
 Aside from the basic boxes, such as your name, here are some helpful 
tips for successfully creating a Gmail account.
 
• In the box to the right of Desired Login Name, enter the username you 
would like and click the Check Availability button. If your name isn’t 
available, red words appear that suggest some available names 
similar to the username you chose. Choose one of the suggestions 
by clicking the radio button to the left of it, or enter a new user-
name and click the Check Availability button again. Repeat these 
steps until you find an available name (the warning text changes 
from red to blue when your username is available).
 
• When you choose a password, the Password Strength bar on the 
right tells you whether your password is strong. A strong password 
usually has a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, such 
as # or ^. For tips on how to choose a secure password, click the 
Password Strength link.
 
• Be sure to choose a security question that you’ll remember. If you 
ever forget your password, you’ll need to answer the question 
correctly to access your account. You can also enter a secondary 
e-mail address, if you have one, and Google will send a link to reset 
your password there.
 
• From the Location list, choose your country, and then enter the scram-
bled letters in the Word Verification box below. If you can’t read the 
letters, try reloading the page to get a new image, or click the 
wheelchair icon to the right of the box to hear the letters spoken.

4. Read the Terms of Service. If you agree with them and are ready to 
create your account, click the I Accept. Create My Account button at 
the bottom of the page.
 
 You’re taken to a screen that introduces you to Gmail.
 
5. Click the I’m Ready – Show Me My Account link in the top-right corner 
of the Introduction screen to go to your new Gmail inbox.
Now that you have an account, go to Chapter 4 to start building your Google 
Sites. If you want to find out more about Gmail, Chapter 19 is waiting for

Creating a Google Apps Account
Start taking advantage of Google Sites for your team, your classroom, or your 
company by signing up for a Google Apps account with your school or work 
e-mail address.
In Chapter 1, we mention four different editions of Google Apps: Standard, 
Premier, Education, and Team. Your organization may already have signed 
up for Google Apps Standard, Premier, or Education Edition, in which case 
your administrator should have given you a username and password. If you 
haven’t received a login or your company doesn’t use Google Apps, you can 
jump right into Google Apps Team Edition.
Google has created a custom address for your Google Apps. The address will 
look similar to www.google.com/a/yourschool.edu or www.google.
com/a/yourwork.com, replacing yourschool.edu or yourwork.com with 
your school or work domain name, of course.
Follow these steps to sign up for Google Apps Team Edition:
 
If you receive an e-mail invitation to Google Apps from a co-worker or fellow 
student or professor, click the link in the message and skip to Step 3.
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to your Google Apps custom address 
(www.google.com/a/your-domain.com).
 
 Your screen should look similar to Figure 3-4.
 
2.  Click the Create an Account Here link on the left side of the screen, 
below the login box.
 
 The Google Apps Team Edition Sign Up screen loads. Note: If you don’t 
see the Create an Account Here link, chances are your organization 
already has a different edition of Google Apps. Check with your adminis-
trator to obtain your login information.

Figure 3-4: 
Open your

account.
 
 
3. On the Sign Up screen, enter your current e-mail username and 
choose a password. Then enter the garbled letters in the Word 
Verification box and enter your name and location in the boxes 
that follow.
  
 When you choose a password, the Password Strength bar below the 
password box tells you whether your password is strong. A strong 
password usually has a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, 
such as # or ^. For tips on how to choose a secure password, click the 
Password Strength link. Google recommends that you shouldn’t use 
your work password to protect your security.
 
4. Read the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy in the box at the bottom 
of the screen. When you’re ready to create your account, click the I 
Accept. Continue to Google Apps button below the box.
 
 An e-mail is sent to your regular work or school address. Note: You may 
have to wait a minute or two for the e-mail to arrive.
 
5. Log into your e-mail Inbox and open the message from Google titled 
“Google Apps: Sign-Up Verification”. Click the long, cryptic link 
to verify your address. On the Thank You screen that appears, click 
the Click Here to Continue link to return to your Google Apps login 
screen.
That’s it! You now have a Google Apps account and can start working with 
your co-workers, study group, or fellow professors. Continue reading to 
begin exploring the Google Apps dashboard.

Logging In and Finding Your 
Way around the Dashboard
The Google Apps dashboard gives you access to all your Google Apps, includ-
ing Sites, Docs, Calendar, Start Page (which is similar to iGoogle), and Talk 
(Chat), from one convenient Web page. It also connects you with the other 
users in your school or work domain, and lets you invite your co-workers and 
classmates to join.
To log into the Google Apps dashboard, open your browser and navigate to 
your Google Apps custom address (www.google.com/a/your-domain.
com). Your screen should look similar to Figure 3-4 in the preceding section. 
Enter your username (the part of your e-mail address before the @ sign) and 
password in the boxes on the left side of the screen and click the Sign In 
button. The dashboard appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
Bookmark your Google Apps custom address for quick access to your login 
and dashboard.
In the sections that follow, we help you launch your Google Apps, invite 
others to join, customize the appearance of your organization’s Google Apps 
services, and last but not least, change your password.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Access 
your Google 
Apps from

Launching your Google Apps
From the dashboard, you can launch any of your Google Apps, including 
Google Sites by clicking the name of the app from the list on the right, as 

39
 Chapter 3: Signing Up for Google Apps and Getting Your Team Online
shown in Figure 3-5. You can also download Google Talk to your computer by 
clicking the Downloading Google Talk link and then clicking the Open or Save 
File button on the dialog box that appears.
 
After you open an app, such as Calendar, click any of the links in the top-left 
corner of your screen to quickly switch between your other apps, such as 
Docs or Sites. Open your Google Apps custom address (you bookmarked it, 
right?) to return to your dashboard at any time.
Inviting other users to join Google Apps
Because Google Apps is optimized for teams, getting your co-workers and 
fellow students to join you online is important if you want to get the most 
from Sites and the other apps. Here’s how you invite other users:
 
1. Check to see whether your team members have already signed up for 
Google Apps by clicking the Users link in the box on the left side of 
the dashboard.
 
 A screen similar to Figure 3-6 appears.
 
2. From this screen, click the Invite New Users link to open a screen 
where you can send a message to other users in your domain.
 
 The Invite New Users screen appears. You can also click the Invite More 
Users link on the main dashboard screen to open this screen.
 
3. In the top box, enter the e-mail addresses of your co-workers or fellow 
students. Then enter a short message in the box below.
 
 If you have more than one address, separate the addresses with a 
comma. Also, your team’s e-mail addresses must have the same domain 
as you for them to receive the invitation. In Chapter 8, we show you how 
to invite users from outside of your domain to view your Google Sites.

4. Click the Invite Users button at the bottom of the screen to send your 
invitation and return to the User Accounts screen or the dashboard.
 
 When they open your invitation, they can click on the link and enter 
their account information in the screen that appears, as described in the 
previous section. If you decide you don’t want to send the invitation, 
click the Cancel button to discard your message and return to the 
dashboard.
Customizing your apps appearance
A lesser known, but really cool, feature of Google Apps is the ability to modify 
how your login screen looks and add your own custom logo to each of your 
apps. The custom logo replaces the official Google logo that appears in the 
top-left corner of each of the apps.
With Google Apps Team Edition, anyone in your domain can customize the 
appearance. Generally, one person adds a logo, and when it’s set, everyone 
else leaves it alone. But, if you or another user gets tired of how things look, 
here’s how to add a little pizzazz to your Google Apps:
 
1. Open your browser and log into your Google Apps dashboard. 
 
 The address for the login screen is similar to www.google.com/a/
yourdomain.com.
 
2. Click the Customize Appearance link in the box on the left side of the 
screen. 
 
 A screen that looks similar to Figure 3-7 appears.

 Chapter 3: Signing Up for Google Apps and Getting Your Team Online
 
3. Choose a set of header logos that you want to use with your Google 
Apps.
 
 To use the default Google logos, click the radio button to the left of 
Default Logos. To use a custom logo, click the radio button to the left of 
Custom Logo and do the following:
 
a. On your computer, locate a copy of your logo and save it to your 
Desktop folder.
 
 For best results, resize your logo (using Paint or a similar program) 
to 143 x 59 pixels and save it as either a PNG or GIF file. You can 
use a larger, unedited image, but it may appear distorted or fuzzy 
when it’s loaded within Google Apps.
 
b. Return to your Web browser and click the Browse button.
 
 A File Browser window appears.
 
c. In the File Browser window, navigate to your desktop and select the 
logo you downloaded. Click the Open button to return to the 
Customize screen.
 
d. Click the Upload button to save your logo to Google Apps. 
 
 A preview of your logo appears in the Custom Logo box. Be sure 
to click the radio button next to Custom Logo to make your new 
logo active.
 
4. Select a Sign-in Box Color from the options near the bottom of the 
Customize screen by clicking the radio button to the left of the color 
option you want.
 
 If you want to create a custom box color, click the radio button to the 
left of the Custom option and enter a hex number for the colors you 
want for the border and background.
  
 Even we don’t know what the hex number is except that it’s a 6-digit 
number that identifies one color out of millions. To find the perfect color 
(and its hex number), open another browser window and navigate 
to www.colorschemer.com/online.html. Click the colors on the 
palette at the bottom of the screen to find similar colors. When you find 
your color, copy the hex number below it (it’s the number with the # 
sign), return to the Customize screen, and paste the number in the 
Border or Background box.
 
5. When you’re happy with your new logo and sign-in box colors, click 
the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen.
 
 When you return to the dashboard or load any of your apps, your new 
logo appears. It also appears for each of the other users in your domain.

Changing your password
It’s a good idea to change your password from time to time. Aside from 
making you remember yet another new password, it’s a good way to keep 
your information safe. That is unless you keep forgetting your password, and 
then it doesn’t help very much at all. Here’s how to make sure that you have 
the best new password:
 
1. To change your Google Apps password, click the Change Your 
Password link in the box on the left side of the dashboard screen.
 
2. Enter your current password in the appropriate box, and then enter 
your new password in the two boxes that follow.
 
 Keep an eye on the Password Strength meter to make sure that your 
new password is strong.
 
3. Click the Change Password button to save your new password and 
return to the dashboard. 
If you ever forget your Google Apps password, you can easily create a new 
one from the login screen. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the I Cannot Access My Account link at the bottom of the sign-in 
box.
 
2. Enter your username on the next screen and click the Submit button.
 
3. On the next screen, type the garbled letters that appear in the box and 
click Submit.
 
 Google sends you an e-mail with a link to a page where you can reset 
your password.
 
4. Open your e-mail, look for the message titled “Google Password 
Assistance,” and then click the link that appears in the message.
 
5. Enter your new password twice and click the Save New Password 
button.
 
 A new screen appears indicating that your password has been reset.
 
6. Click the Click Here to Continue link to return to the sign-in screen, 
where you can log in once again to your account with your new 
password. 
That wasn’t too hard, now was it? That pretty much covers the Google Apps 
dashboard. Make sure that you get your co-workers or study group to sign 
up, too. That way you can work on your projects, documents, and calendars 
together.
We won’t keep you any longer. Flip the page and get ready to dig into Google 
Sites and start creating your own Web site, wiki, or file sharing page. You 
have everything you need to start, so get going, already!

Exploring Google Sites
In This Chapter
▶ Opening your sites
▶ Browsing other sites in your domain
▶ Creating and editing a new site
▶ Familiarizing yourself with the page elements
▶ Adding text, images, tables, gadgets, and more
N
ow that you have a Google Account and have discovered what you can 
do with Google Sites, it’s time to dig in and start exploring. Google Sites 
is easy to use. If you’ve ever used a word processor, you already know the 
basics to making the most of Sites.
This chapter explains how to log into Google Sites and begin creating and 
editing your very own site. You’ll find out how the basic tools work and be on 
your way to building a useful, powerful site. We also cover how to open other 
sites that your team has invited you to collaborate on.
Opening Your Sites
Getting into Google Sites is just like logging into any other Web site. After you 
log in, you can begin creating new sites or edit sites that already exist. When 
you’re ready to create a new site or open your existing sites, open your Web 
browser and log into Google Sites by doing one of the following:
 
✓ Google Account users: Go to http://sites.google.com and enter 
your login name and password in the Sign In box on the right side of the 
screen. Then click the Sign In button.
 
✓ Google Apps users: Go to http://sites.google.com/a/your
domain.com and enter your username and password in the Sign In box 
on the left side of the screen. Then click Sign In.

44
Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
 
 Google Apps users can also access Sites from the Google Apps dash-
board. Log into www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com and click the 
Sites link.
The first time you log in, you see a big blue Create a Site button, like the one 
shown in Figure 4-1. If you’ve been invited to join a site by a friend or co-
worker, you’re taken directly to the Google Sites Home, which lists all your 
sites along with those you’ve been invited to participate on.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Click 
Create a 
Site to start 
building a 
new site.
 
Note: If you’ve recently signed into another Google service, such as Gmail, 
you may be taken directly to your Google Sites Home.
Navigating your Google Sites Home
The Google Sites Home screen, shown in Figure 4-2, lists all the sites that you 
have access to. These include sites you own, sites you collaborate on, and 
sites you can view. From the Google Sites Home, you can search your sites, 
create a new site, or open an existing site. Here are the basic options avail-
able on the Google Sites Home:
 
✓ Search Sites: Type a word or phrase in the Search Sites textbox and 
click the Search Sites button. Your results appear in a list.
 
✓ Create New Site: Click this button to create a new site. We show you 
how to set one up in the next section.
 
✓ My Sites: Click the site name link in this list to view or edit your site. 
Note: Unless you’ve already created a site, you may not see any links in 
this list the first time you log in.

Browsing other sites in your domain
By default, sites created by Google Apps users are automatically shared with 
everyone in your domain. This means that you can begin browsing through 
sites that your colleagues have created without having to create one of your 
own. From the Google Sites Home, here’s how to browse those sites:
 
1. Click the Browse Sites within <Yourdomain.com> link from your 
Google Sites Home, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
 A screen similar to Figure 4-3 appears.

Click a 
category 
or use the 
Search tool 
to find a 
site in your 
domain.
 
 
2. Click a category link on the left side of the screen. 
 
 Sites fitting your category appear on the right. You can also use the 
Search Sites box at the top of the screen. See the section, “Creating a 
New Site,” later in this chapter, to find out more about categories.
 
3. Click the title of the site you want to view.
 
 That site opens and you can begin browsing through its contents.

Accepting a site invitation
In many cases, it’s likely that someone has invited you to collaborate on a 
site. As a collaborator, you can exercise your wiki power and make changes 
to the site by adding your insight and ideas.
When you’re invited to participate on a site, you generally receive an e-mail 
invitation, like the one shown in Figure 4-4. The invitation always includes a 
direct link to the site and may include a brief message from the person who 
sent the invitation, such as instructions or a description of the site.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Open a 
site from 
an e-mail 
invitation.
 
To open a site you’ve been invited to, do the following:
 
1. From your e-mail client, locate and open your e-mail invitation.
 
2.  Click the site link found just below the title of the site.
 
 If you haven’t already logged into Sites, you’re taken to your login screen.
 
 When you open a site created by a Google Apps user, you’re taken to the 
login screen for that user’s domain. If you have a normal Google Account 
or are not part of that user’s domain, make sure that you do the following:
 
a. Click the Sign In with a Different Account link at the bottom of the 
screen.
 
b. In the box that appears, enter your e-mail address and click the Go 
button.

47
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
 
 You’re taken to your Google Apps login screen or the Google 
Account login screen.
 
3. Enter your username and password and click the Sign In button to log 
into Google Sites.
 
 On the next screen, you’re taken directly to the site you’ve been invited 
to. Note: Sites that you’ve been invited to will also appear automatically 
on your Google Sites Home screen.
Getting back to your Google Sites Home
Any time you want to switch to a different site from the one you’re on, click 
the My Sites link that appears to the right of your e-mail address at the top of 
your screen. You’re taken directly to your Google Sites Home, where you can 
open the sites you’re participating on or browse other sites in your domain.
Knowing your role
Whether you’ve created your own site or are working on one that someone 
else has made, you’re assigned a role that allows you to make changes to the 
site . . . or not. As an owner, a collaborator, or a viewer, understanding which 
role you have is important to knowing what changes, if any, you can make to 
the site. Here’s how you can tell your role:
 
✓ Owners: When you create a site, you are the owner. When you log into 
a site as an owner, you see the Edit buttons, which allow you to create 
new pages and edit existing pages . Owners also have ultimate power 
over the site settings and can permanently delete a site when it’s no 
longer needed.
 
✓ Collaborators: If you see the Edit buttons on a site that you didn’t 
create, chances are you’re a collaborator. You can make changes and 
add comments but can’t change certain site settings, and you can’t 
delete the site.
 
✓ Viewers: When you open a site and you don’t see the Edit buttons at 
the top of your page, you’re just a viewer. Viewers, as you may have 
guessed, can’t make any changes to the pages on the site. They can only 
sit back and watch. When you create a public site, other users are view-
ers by default.

Creating a New Site
After you master logging into Google Sites and finding your way around the 
Google Sites Home, it’s time to begin creating your very own site. Fortunately 
for you, creating a new site is very straightforward and takes only a few 
moments. Here’s how:
 
1. Log into your Google Sites Home.
 
2. Click the Create New Site button.
 
 The Create New Site screen appears, similar to Figure 4-5.
 
3. Enter your Site information.
 
 Here’s how that information is used:
 
• Site name: This name appears at the top of all your pages. It’s 
also the name of the link that appears on your Google Sites Home 
screen (minus any spaces in the Site name).
 
Figure 4-5: 
Enter your 
new site 
information 
and choose 
a theme
 

49
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
 
• Site location: The address to your site includes all the part in gray 
(refer to Figure 4-5), as well as your custom address. Note: The site 
location you choose may already be taken. If you get an error when 
you try to create your site, try entering a different name or add 
some numbers or letters to the end.
 
• Site categories (optional): Only Google Apps users see this field. 
Enter categories here (such as Corporate, or Student Project) to 
help other users in your domain quickly browse to your site. Make 
sure that you separate multiple categories with commas.
 
• Site description (optional): Type in a brief description of your site. 
Descriptions make your site easy to find and appear next to your 
Site Name link on the Google Sites Home screen.
 
• Mature content (optional): Check this box if you’re hosting content 
that isn’t suitable for young audiences. In case you were wonder-
ing, Google won’t host any ads on sites with mature content.
 
• Collaborate with/Share with: Indicate whom you want to share your 
site with. To share your site with the world, click the radio button 
next to Everyone in the World. To keep your site private, click the 
Only People I Specify radio button. Google Apps users can also 
choose to share their site with other users in their organization by 
clicking the radio button next to Everyone at <Yourdomain.com>.
 
• Site theme: Select a theme for your site by clicking the site theme 
box. You can always change your theme or customize your colors 
and graphics later. To view all the available themes, click the More 
Themes link and then choose the theme you want.
 
4. When you’re satisfied with your site information, click the blue Create 
Site button. Note: you may have to type in a garbled code before you 
can continue.
 
 After a few moments, your site is created, and you can begin editing it. 
Your site now appears on your Google Sites Home screen as well.
 
If you change your mind about any of your site settings, you can always 
change them by clicking the Site Settings link in the top-right corner of your 
screen.
Editing Pages on Your Site
Now that you have a site, you’re on your way to creating one of the most 
useful sites on the Internet — at least for you and your team! This will be 
where you share your information publicly or keep your team project safe 
and secure. In this section, we help you know when you can edit pages, what 
the basic parts of a page are, and introduce the basic formatting tools that 
are at your disposal.

Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
Using the Edit buttons
When you’re the owner or collaborator on a site, the Create New Page and Edit 
Page buttons appear at the top of each page in the site. These appear in what we 
call View mode. Click these buttons to begin adding pages and making changes.
 
✓ Create a New Page: This button adds new pages to your site. As your 
project grows, you can add pages that work like regular Web sites, wikis, 
and file sharing sites. We cover how to use these new pages in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Edit Page: Click this button to enter Edit mode, as shown in Figure 4-6. 
When you’re in Edit mode, the Edit Page button is replaced by the Edit 
Page toolbar. Editable areas on your page are highlighted yellow and 
appear with a dotted outline.

✓ More Actions: The More Actions button is really a menu. Click it and 
you see several tools that let you organize your page and subscribe to 
changes. These tools are used in later chapters.
 
✓ Site Settings: This is also a menu that allows you to access your site 
sharing and appearance options. Chapter 7 digs deeper into customizing 
your site settings.

51
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
When you’re in Edit mode, the Edit Page and More Actions buttons are 
replaced by the Edit Page toolbar. After you’ve made edits to your page, click 
the Save or Cancel button to return to View mode.
 
Web browsers crash from time to time. We recommend you save your page 
often. Google has your back, though, and in the case of an unexpected glitch, 
Google Sites will recover your latest work the next time you enter Edit mode.
Checking out your page elements
A basic page in a site has five main parts, as shown in Figure 4-6 in the pre-
ceding section.
 
✓ Header: This is where the name of your site goes, as well as a custom 
logo, if you choose. We show you how to customize a header in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Sidebar: The Sidebar appears on either the right or left side of the 
body. Usually, you’ll see the Navigation box (which lists the important 
pages) and the Recent Site Activity box (which show pages that have 
been updated recently). We show you how to customize your Sidebar in 
Chapter 7.
 
✓ Body: The body contains all the information on a given page. The body 
of a page can contain paragraphs of text, lists of links, files, Web clips, 
and gadgets. When you’re in Edit mode, the body is the only part of the 
page that you can change. The body also has a spot for a page title.
 
✓ Attachments: You and your collaborators can upload files from your 
computer to any pages that you to allow attachments. Attachments 
appear on the page below the body.
 
✓ Comments: Get feedback on your page or share your ideas with com-
ments. The Comments section appears below attachments.
When you enter Edit mode, the body is the only area that can be edited 
directly. However, you can customize many of the other elements as well. See 
Chapter 7 when you’re ready to make adjustments for your whole site.
Using the right toolbar for the job
Users familiar with Google Docs will notice that the tools that appear in Edit 
mode are very similar to those found in Google Docs. Table 4-1 identifies 
what each of the tools on the Edit Page toolbar does. In addition to these 
tools, four menus provide additional options for formatting your page. These 
include Insert, Format, Table, and Layout. In the next sections, we cover how 
to use these tools to format your text and objects.

52
Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
 
The Edit Page toolbar always appears at the top of the window, even if you 
scroll down on a page. This way, you have easy access to your tools even 
when you’re not at the top.

Applying Text Formatting to Your Page
Most of the buttons on the Edit Page toolbar are used for formatting. 
Formatting makes pages more interesting visually and makes them easier to 
read. You can apply formatting to your text by doing either of the following:

54
Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
 
✓ Select any text you want to format and click the desired button.
 
✓ While you’re typing, click a formatting button first to turn on the fea-
ture, enter your text, and then click the formatting button again to turn 
off the option.
Changing your body text style
The body text that appears on each new page uses a font called Normal, size 10. 
Normal is a basic Web font without any frills. The point size refers to how big or 
small a font appears on-screen and in print. The higher the number, the larger 
the font. The default 10 point (10pt) font is large enough for most readers.
To change the way your text appears, first highlight the text you want to 
change. Click the Font drop-down list (by clicking the little triangle shown 
in Figure 4-7) and choose a different font from the list, such as Georgia, 
Trebuchet, or Verdana. In similar fashion, to change the text size, click the 
Size drop-down list and choose a different point size, such as 12 or 14.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Choose your 
font and 
size options 
from their 
drop-down 
menus on 
the Edit 
Page 
toolbar.
 
The same procedure applies for changing the color of your text or placing 
a highlight color around your words. To change the color of text, click the 
Text Color button and select a color from the color palette that appears. To 
add a highlight color around your words, click the Highlight Color button and 
select the color you want from the palette. Be sure the highlight color con-
trasts with the color of your text so that it can be read easily.
Adding emphasis
 
 There’s nothing more basic than applying bold, italic, and underline formats 
to your words to help you make a point.

55
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
 
✓ Bold: Makes your words appear more important, with darker, thicker 
letters.
 
✓ Italic: Slants your text onto its side to offset it from other text.
 
✓ Underline: Used for titles and headings, underline adds a line below the 
text. Underline should be used sparingly because other users may mis-
take it for a link, which is usually underlined on Web pages.
Removing unwanted formats
 
 Font style, color, bold, and other formats can be removed easily by selecting 
your text and clicking the Remove Formatting button. You can remove for-
matting by either clicking the Remove Formatting button from the Edit Page 
toolbar or you can choose Format➪Clear Formatting.
Creating lists
 
 To begin a list, click either the Numbered or Bulleted list buttons, enter the 
first list item, and then press Enter. Each time you press the Enter key, a new 
bullet or the next number appears. You can also create the entire list first, 
select the list, and then tap the appropriate button. Bulleted lists perform 
these functions (and look like this one):
 
✓ Display information in no particular order or sequence.
 
✓ Provide an easy way to organize similar types of information.
 
✓ Make complicated lists of information easier to read and take in.
Numbered lists imply a sequence of events. You can start this kind of list by
 
1. Pressing the Numbered List button.
 
2. Entering your text.
 
3. Pressing Enter at the end of each paragraph.
 
To turn bulleting or numbering off, click the buttons again. You may need to 
press Enter after your list ends and also tap the Decrease Indent button a few 
times to realign your text to the left margin, which we discuss next.
Aligning your paragraphs
 
 The Increase Indent button moves a selected paragraph ½ inch to the right of 
the current margin. This is often used for long quotes. The Decrease Indent 
button does just the opposite by moving an entire paragraph ½ inch to the 

56
Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
left. This button is often needed to correct paragraphs that may slip out of 
alignment. For example, if the bullets or numbers are removed from a list, 
oftentimes the paragraphs remain indented improperly. Simply select the 
misaligned paragraphs and then click the Decrease Indent button.
 
 The Edit Page toolbar offers three one-click alignment possibilities:
 
✓ Left align: By default, text on pages is aligned to the left margin. This 
means that the text appears straight on the left margin yet is ragged on 
the right side, as a quick glance at the toolbar icons reveals. To move 
centered, right-aligned, or justified text to the default left margin, select 
the text and click the Align Text Left button.
 
✓ Center align: To center a title or an image, select your text or image and 
then click the Center button. You can also click the Center button first 
and then enter your text.
 
✓ Right align: Align your text on the right margin by clicking the Align 
Text Right button. This option is rarely used because it’s often hard to 
read text that is ragged on the left side of a page.
 
The Format menu provides alternative ways of selecting the left, right, and 
center align commands. For example, to justify left, click Format➪Align➪Left.
Power formatting with styles, superscripts, 
subscripts, and more
The Format menu provides text styles that can help you quickly locate impor-
tant information on your page. Styles are used primarily to organize your 
content. They are particularly handy if you want to add a table of contents 
for quick page navigation. 
The following styles can be applied by selecting your text and choosing one 
of these options from the Format menu:
 
✓ Heading (H2): The largest heading style; generally used for titles.
 
✓ Sub-heading (H3): A smaller heading style; sub-headings are often used 
for section titles.
 
✓ Minor heading (H4): The smallest heading style. Slightly larger than 
normal text, apply this style to less important section headings.
 
✓ Normal paragraph text: The default style for normal text. Apply the 
normal paragraph style to remove other styles, such as H2, H3, and H4.
In the lower section of the Format menu are some other important, yet spe-
cialized, formatting commands:

57
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
 
✓ Strikeout: Apply this style to put a line through (or strike out) words.
 
✓ Superscript: Apply this style to raise text above the line. This style is 
used often for footnote references and exponents in mathematics, such 
as 23=8.
 
✓ Subscript: Use this style to lower the text below the line. This style is 
used for such things as chemical notations, as in H2O.
Inserting Images, Links, Table of 
Contents, Lines, and Other Gadgets
Sites are about more than just words. They’re meant to be dynamic, color-
ful, and very useful. The Insert menu helps you do just that. To see what we 
mean, click the Insert menu and look at all the options. This menu allows you 
to insert a host of elements: images, links, table of contents, horizontal lines, 
content from other Google Apps, and other gadgets.
Before we jump into this detailed list, it may be good to preview what some 
of these features actually do. Take a look at Figure 4-8. We will refer back to 
this figure several times in the next few pages.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Elements 
that can be 
applied from 
the Insert 
menu.
 
Adding images 
Inserting images is a breeze. You can insert images that already appear on 
other Web pages, or upload your own pictures from your computer. Follow 
the steps below.
 
If you’re adding an image from another Web page, make sure that you have 
permission to use it on your page. Note: Clip art and images from Wikipedia 
are generally okay to use.
 
1. Click your mouse where you want the image to appear on the Page.
 
2. Click the Insert menu and then click the Image option.
 
 The Add an Image screen appears.

58
Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
 
3. Select either the Uploaded Images radio button or the Web Address 
(URL) radio button.
 
 Depending on which radio button you select, the steps change a bit:
 
a. If you select the Uploaded Images radio button, click the Browse 
button. In the File Upload dialog box that appears, browse to your 
file, select it, and then click the Open button, which places the 
path to the file in the Browse box.
 
b. If you select the Web Address (URL) radio button, type or paste 
the URL into the Image URL textbox. A preview of the image 
appears in the dialog box.
 
4. Click the Add Image button to place the image on your page, or 
choose Cancel to abandon the process.
 
5. (Optional) To make changes in how your image appears, click the 
image.
 
 A blue bar appears below the image with several options, as shown in 
Figure 4-9.
 
Figure 4-9: 
Click an 
image to 
show its 
formatting 
bar.
 
 
• Align: Aligns your image to the left, right, or center of the text adja-
cent to the image.
 
• Size: Changes how large your image will appear by clicking the S, 
M, or L options. You can also click the little white boxes around 
your image to resize the image manually.
 
• Wrap: Allows the text to appear around or alongside the text. If you 
don’t check this option, the text is pushed below the image.
 
• Remove: Deletes the image from your page.
 
Google Sites can also access images directly from the Internet, so you don’t 
have to upload the file and you save space. When you find an image on 
another Web page that you want to add to your site, right-click the image and 
choose Copy from the menu that appears. Return to your site and open your 
page in Edit mode. Click where you want your image to appear and choose 
Edit➪Paste from your browser menu, or press Ctrl+V. Like magic, your image 
appears and you can make any adjustments you like.

59
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
Linking to other pages
Links are very useful when you want to locate frequently used Web pages, 
e-mail addresses, or other online resources. To create a hyperlink on your 
page, select the text you want to turn into a link and click the Link button on 
the Edit Page toolbar or choose Insert➪Link. The Create Link window appears.
From the list that appears, choose from the options below. The textbox 
changes depending on the option you select.
 
✓ Existing Page: Links to another page in your site. From the list, click 
the name of the page you want to link to and then click the OK button 
to insert the link. You can also click the Create New Page button at the 
bottom of the window to add a new page on the fly.
 
✓ Web address: Enter the URL in the textbox that appears, such as www.
wikipedia.org. (Google Sites automatically adds the http:// for you.)
 
If you need to change any of the settings above, click the linked text and click 
the Change link in the blue box that appears. Remove the link entirely by 
selecting the link and clicking the Remove link.
Adding a table of contents
A table of contents lists all the headings that appear on a page. When you 
add a table of contents to a page in Google Sites, all the titles to which you 
added an H2, H3, or H4 heading by using the Format menu will be listed as 
links; refer to Figure 4-8. Visitors can click a heading from the table of con-
tents to skip directly to that section on the page. This is especially helpful for 
pages with lots of text, such as handbooks or manuals.
To insert a table of contents, choose Insert➪Table of Contents. The Insert 
Table of Contents screen appears. Enter a width for your table of contents 
and then click Save. A placeholder for your table of contents is added to your 
page. As with images, to adjust the wrapping and alignment, click the place-
holder and choose your options from the blue bar that appears.
 
The table of contents does not show your links in Edit mode. When you click 
the Save button and preview your site, you can make sure that your table of 
contents appears correctly. The links are automatically updated every time 
you add or remove headers and click Save.

60
Part I: Getting Started with Google Sites and Chrome 
Inserting horizontal lines
Horizontal lines can be placed on a page to separate sections or paragraphs. 
It’s like drawing a line with a pencil horizontally across a piece of paper. 
(To see a sample, refer to Figure 4-8.) Add a horizontal line to your page by 
choosing Insert➪Horizontal Line.
Fitting Your Stuff in Tables
Tables create little boxes in a grid pattern inside a page. By using columns and 
rows, tables organize certain types of information in a valuable and visual way.
Follow these steps to create a table:
 
1. Click the Table menu and choose Insert Table. 
 
 A grid appears where you can select how large you want your table to be.
 
2. Highlight the number of rows (down) and columns (across) that you 
want for your table and then click the square in the bottom-right 
corner.
 
 Your new table appears on your page and you can begin entering lists, 
numbers, and more.
After you create your table, you can format the text by using the Edit Page 
toolbar and then insert images, links, or anything else with the Insert menu.
The Table menu gives you further control over your table. From the menu 
you can modify, move, insert, or delete an entire table, one or more columns, 
one or more rows, and one or more cells.
 
✓ Inserting rows and columns: Place your insertion point in the column 
or row where you want the new row or column to appear. Click the 
Table drop-down list followed by Insert Row Up, Insert Row Down, Insert 
Column on the Left, or Insert Column on the Right.
 
✓ Deleting rows and columns: Select the column or row you want to 
delete. Click the Table drop-down list followed by Delete Table, Delete 
Row, or Delete Column.
 
Moving existing columns is more problematic than moving rows. Start by 
inserting a new column as explained above. Select and copy the column you 
want to move and then paste the information into the new column. Only then 
should you delete the original column of information.

61
 Chapter 4: Exploring Google Sites
Fitting More Stuff on Your Page
Although you can create an unlimited number of pages and stretch your 
page as long as you like, you may find it useful to keep more gadgets and 
other useful information at the top of your page. This is especially true for 
your main Home page. For this reason, you can choose between one column, 
which keeps things simple, or two columns, which gives you twice the space.
To change the number of columns on your page, click the Layout drop-down 
list and choose either One-column or Two-column. The two-column layout 
adds an extra editable area to the body of your page. Click inside either 
column to add text, graphics, or other gadgets as you normally would.

Google Site

In this part . . .
H
ere we cover the bread and butter of Google Sites. 
Three chapters are dedicated to helping you tweak 
your style and fill your site with content, gadgets, and 
more. You also see how to add stuff from Google Docs and 
Google Calendar.
The last two chapters help you share your site with the 
world. Get your team on board with your project, let your 
family in on the excitement, or create a site that only you 
can change. We show you how here.

Chapter 5
Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
In This Chapter
▶ Designing a Web page
▶ Using a dashboard
▶ Making announcements to have your voice heard
▶ Filling your File Cabinet
▶ Tracking projects using lists
W
e mention at the beginning of this book that Google Sites combinesall 
the tools you need to create dynamic Web pages, construct power-
ful wikis, and easily share files with your team, class, or family. To help make 
these functions possible, you can choose from five different layouts and 
create a site that does everything you need to get your project done or share 
your stuff. Each layout combines elements of the basic wiki page with a spe-
cific set of easy-to-use tools to help you share your work and keep on top of 
your projects.
Here’s a look at your layout choices. To see these pages in action, look for 
the sections in this chapter dedicated to each of these layouts.
 
✓ Web Page: Use a Web page to share information. Web pages are great 
for manuals or handbooks, notes, and other information. Images and 
gadgets add pizzazz to any Web page.
 
✓ Dashboard: The dashboard page brings together all the great Google 
Gadgets, which are like mini Web pages with dynamic content. You 
choose which gadgets you want, and Google takes care of updating and 
showing off your stuff.
 
✓ Announcements: When you want to make important information known, 
the Announcements page works wonders. This layout allows you to post 
news and comments in much the same way you do with a blog.
 
✓ File Cabinet: To make file sharing easy, the File Cabinet layout keeps 
your documents neat and tidy. The File Cabinet even keeps track of dif-
ferent versions of your files so you can find an older copy if you need to.

66
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
✓ List: The List layout is very flexible and lets you create virtually any type 
of list. From To Do lists and rosters to checklists and deadlines, you can 
keep track of it all with a List.
After you create a new site, adding new pages and expanding your site is a 
breeze. This chapter starts with steps to easily add new pages to your site. 
Then in the following sections, you see how to use each of the tools that are 
specific to each layout.
 
If you don’t have a site already, Chapter 4 goes through the steps to 
create one.
Adding New Pages to Your Site
Depending on what kind of site you want, adding a variety of pages can help 
you keep all of your important information handy and help you get your 
project done in a flash. We won’t tell you how you should organize your 
pages, but Part II of this book has some great suggestions for personal, work, 
school, and project sites.
After you fill your home page and are ready to expand your site, adding pages 
and choosing a new page layout is simple. Here’s how:
 
1. Open your browser and log into your site.
 
2. Click the Create New Page button at the top of the page.
 
 You see a screen similar to Figure 5-1. Note: If you don’t see the Create 
New Page button on a site you didn’t create, you may not be allowed to 
make changes to the site. First, make sure that you’re logged in (there’s 
a login link at the bottom of the screen); then if you still can’t make 
changes, ask the site owner to add you as a collaborator.
 
3. Type the name of your new page in the Page Name textbox.
 
 
You can adjust your page name later by editing the page title.
 
4. Click the radio button inside the box of the page layout you desire.
 
5. Choose where you want to put the page:
 
• Put page at the top level. Pages that are general to your site, such 
as announcements or main project pages usually go here.
 
• Put page under current page. If the page you’re creating is related to 
the page you were just viewing, choose this option to create a sub-
page. Grouping similar pages together helps you keep your site 
organized.

67

• Choose a different location. This is helpful if you want to create a 
sub-page, like the preceding option. Click this link to group your 
page with another existing page on your site, as shown in Figure 
5-2. From the list that appears, click the name of the page you want 
to group with and then click the Select button.

Otherwise, click Cancel if you don’t want a new page after all.

68
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
Adjusting page settings
Each page has several options that allow you to tweak and personalize the 
elements that appear on your page. These settings let you show or hide ele-
ments, such as the header or attachments, and allow you to add your page to 
the Navigation box on your site’s Sidebar.
 
1. Open the page whose settings you want to adjust.
 
2. Click the More Actions button at the top of the page and choose Page 
Settings from the list that appears.
 
 Note: If you are currently in Edit mode, you won’t see the More Actions 
button until you click Save or Cancel on the Edit Page toolbar.
 
3. Check the boxes next to the settings you want to enable. Uncheck the 
boxes to disable specific settings.
 
 Each option does something a little different. Read on to find out what 
each of them does. Note: Depending on the page layout, you may not see 
all these options.
 
• Show This in “Navigation” in the Sidebar: By default, the Navigation 
box appears on the Sidebar and contains shortcuts to important 
pages. However, new pages aren’t automatically added to the 
Navigation box. Check this box to create a new link for your cur-
rent page. The new link appears at the bottom of the list.
 
• Show Page Title: Check this box to show the page title. Uncheck the 
box to hide any information found in the title box. Note: The title 
won’t be deleted; you can still edit it, you just won’t see it when 
you view the page.
 
• Show Links to Sub-Pages: When you check this box, a bar appears 
along the bottom of the page with links to sub-pages. These links 
are convenient when you want to show additional information but 
don’t want it to take up space in the Navigation box. Note: This 
option may not appear for all pages.
Crash course in site organization
A word on Web site structure: You may want to 
draw a diagram of your site before you begin 
creating it. If you don’t know how many pages 
to create, look for some ideas in Part IV. When 
you start creating your site, you make a new 
page for each function you want your site to 
have.
The structure shown in Figure 5-2 may work 
as a good start for a project site, but you ulti-
mately decide whether you want more pages 
or fewer pages, depending on your organization 
and how much information you want to share. 
Don’t be limited to the options we show you in 
this figure.

69
 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
 
• Allow Attachments: Check this box to enable yourself and other 
users to upload files to your page. When attachments are allowed, 
you see the Attachments bar along the bottom of the page. See the 
“Working with Attachments” section later in this chapter to find 
out how attachments work.
 
• Allow Comments: When this box is checked, users can make com-
ments to the page, including questions and suggestions. When 
comments are allowed, the Comments bar appears along the 
bottom of the page. See the “Making comments” section later in 
this chapter for more information.
 
• Page URL: Each page has a specific address, usually based on the 
page title. Edit the shortcut name for your current page in the 
box below this option. The page URL appears at the end of your 
site address. For example, the page URL for “project-1” shows up 
as http://sites.google.com/site/yoursite/project-1 
for Google Account users and http://sites.google.com/a/
yourdomain.com/yoursite/project-1 for Google Apps users.
 
 
The page URL for your page can be found at any time on the 
Address bar of your Web browser.
 
4. When you’re finished making adjustments, click the Save button. If 
you don’t want to save, click the Cancel button.
Working with attachments
Attachments are files that you upload to a page. With Sites, they’re similar 
to attachments that you send to a friend or co-worker as part of an e-mail 
message. Just as an e-mail attachment usually has something to do with 
the e-mail message being sent, attachments on Google Sites are generally 
related to the page you upload them to. For example, if you create a page for 
a school field trip or a company retreat, users can attach files that include 
maps, itineraries, permission forms, and so on, without having to create 
separate pages for them.
When enabled, the Attachments bar appears at the bottom of the page, as 
shown in Figure 5-3. Anyone you’ve shared your site with can see and open 
attachments, but only collaborators can upload files of their own.
 
If you don’t see the Attachments bar at the bottom of a page, you can add it by 
following the steps in the preceding section.
To attach your file to a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the + to the left of the title in the Attachments bar.
 
 The upload tool appears (refer to Figure 5-3).

Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
Figure 5-3: 
Add files 
and com-
ments to a 
page with 
the Attach-
ments and 
Comments 
bars.
 
 
2. Click the Browse button.
 
 A dialog box appears, allowing you to open a file on your computer.
 
 
Google won’t allow you to attach certain types of files, such as files 
ending in .exe, which may cause harm to other users’ computers. If you 
have trouble uploading a file, look for an orange bar at the very top of 
the page that describes why your file couldn’t be added.
 
3. On your computer, locate the file you want to attach.
 
4. Click the Open button.
 
 The file is automatically uploaded and attached to your page.
 
Google keeps track of multiple versions of your attachments. When you attach 
a file with the exact same name as an attachment that already exists, a new 
Earlier Versions link appears to the right of the file. Click that link to view all 
revisions of the attachment. To delete an attachment, click the Remove link to 
the right of the attachment information.
Making comments
When you work on a project, post photos, and create amazing Web pages, 
comments allow other users to add their two cents or ask questions. As with 
attachments, only collaborators can post comments, but everyone that has 
access to your site can see them.
 
1. Click the + to the left of the title on the Comments bar found at the 
bottom of the page.
 
 A textbox appears, allowing you to add comments, similar to the one in 
Figure 5-3 in the preceding section.

71
 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
 
2. Enter your comment in the textbox.
 
3. Click the Add Comment button to add your suggestion or question.
 
If you don’t like your comment or want to get rid of it, click the Remove link to 
the left of your name on the Comments bar.
Designing a Web Page
The Web page template is the most straightforward layout available. It basi-
cally consists of an editable header and body. When you create a new site, 
your Home page uses the Web page template by default, similar to Figure 5-4.
Adding text and images to your page is a snap. To find out how or to review 
the tools available for editing your Web page, see Chapter 4. Web pages are 
also great places to include gadgets, which are like mini Web pages that show 
specific information, such as weather or docs. Check out Chapter 6 for more 
information on how to use gadgets.
Each of the other templates begin with the basic Web page elements at 
the top and then have specialized tools that allow you to upload files, post 
announcements, and so on.
There may be times where you want to do more with your Web page than 
the basic tools allow, such as adding a red background color to a table. If 
you know a thing or two about HTML (the coding used to design Web pages), 
then you can add your own special touch to a page.
 
If you want to master HTML, perform a Google search for “Learning HTML” and 
you will find several great resources that take you through basic HTML and 
style sheets.
To make changes to the HTML, you must first click the Edit Page button to 
enter Edit mode. Click inside the header or body box and on the Edit Page 
toolbar, click the HTML button on the far right. A window appears that looks 
similar to Figure 5-5.
Look for the tag you want to change and make your edits. To see what your 
changes look like, select the radio button in the Preview tab at the top of the 
window. When you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Update button at 
the bottom. If you decide you like your page the way it was, you can always 
click Cancel instead.
 
By the way, to change your table’s background color to red, look for the 
<table> tag in the HTML window and add <table bgcolor=red>.

Steering toward a Dashboard
Projects, personal sites, and class sites have the tendency to have a lot of 
information spread around on several different pages. After all, you probably 
want a combination of Announcements pages, File Cabinets, Web pages, and 
Lists. If you’re like us, it’s nice to see all your important information in one 
place without having to click through a bunch of pages. This is where the 
dashboard layout comes in handy.

 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
A dashboard is a Web page that is filled with gadgets. Besides displaying 
weather and mini-games, gadgets let you see information from other pages at 
a glance. For your class page, a dashboard might show you recent announce-
ments, course documents, and the semester calendar, similar to Figure 5-6.
 
Figure 5-6: 
A dash-
board 
shows all 
your infor-
mation in 
one place.
 
When you choose the dashboard layout, a new page is created with two 
columns and four placeholders for gadgets, as shown in Figure 5-7. Replace 
the placeholders with the gadgets of your choice to create a dashboard that 
works for you.

If you want your gadgets to take up more space, you can change the layout so 
that it shows only one column. Click the Layout drop-down list and choose 
One-column.
Note: Dashboard layouts do not show attachments or comments by default, 
but you can add them by clicking the More Actions button at the top of the 
page and choosing Page Settings from the list.
Adding gadgets
An advantage of the Dashboard template is that adding gadgets is a snap, 
using the gadget placeholders. To turn a placeholder into a gadget, click the 
Gadgets button in the center of the placeholder and then select a gadget 
from the list that appears. The Insert Gadget window appears, allowing you 
to enter your gadget settings. After you enter your settings, click Save to add 
the gadget or click Cancel instead.
 
In most cases, your gadget won’t show any information until you exit Edit 
mode by clicking the Save button at the top of the screen.
If you want to add additional gadgets, return to Edit mode and click your 
mouse inside one of the columns where you want to insert the gadget. Click the 
Insert drop-down list on the Edit Page toolbar and choose additional gadgets.
Adjusting gadgets
You may have noticed that when you add a new gadget, you enter specific 
information for the gadget, such as a Web address, or size dimensions. If you 
change your mind and want to change a setting, enter Edit mode on your 
page and click the gadget. A blue bar appears either above or below the 
gadget; in Figure 5-8, the bar appears below the gadget. Each link in the blue 
bar performs a specific function.
 
Figure 5-8:

 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
 
✓ Properties: Click this link to change the settings for your gadget, such 
as the size or page it is accessing. When you click Properties, the Edit 
Gadget window appears.
 
✓ Align: Choose which side of the page you want your gadget to hang out 
on. L means left, C means center, and R means right. Click each letter to 
find the alignment you like best.
 
✓ Wrap: When you have other text and graphics on your page, you can 
choose to have that content wrap around your gadget. On means text 
appears above, to the side, and below your gadget. Off means your 
gadget has its own space and text only appears above and below it.
 
✓ Remove: Click this link to make your gadget disappear. There is no undo 
option here, so if you accidentally remove a gadget, you must add it 
again using the instructions in the preceding section.
Deleting gadgets
It’s perfectly understandable if you want to change your page or get rid of an 
old gadget. To remove a gadget from your page, first enter Edit mode. Click the 
gadget you want to delete and wait for the blue bar to appear (refer to Figure 
5-8). Click the Remove link and, in a flash, your gadget disappears into thin air. 
Now you can replace it with something more elegant or flashy . . . or not!
Using Announcements
Keep your colleagues, team members, or friends up-to-date with the 
Announcements layout. Announcements pages are similar to blogs. The main 
Announcements page lists all your posts or individual announcements, and 
each post is its own page. Use announcements to share your past adventures 
or to notify others of upcoming events.
Your newest posts appear at the top of your Announcements page. Each 
announcement shows who wrote it and when they posted it, similar to Figure 5-9.
 
You can edit the title and body of your Announcements page just as you 
would a normal Web page. Click the Edit Page button to get started.

Writing a new post
When you’re ready to start writing your announcements, browse to your 
Announcements page and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Post button.
 
 A new post is created, as shown in Figure 5-10.
 
2. Enter a title for your post and add any information in the body below.
 
3. (Optional) Click the Save Draft button on the Edit Page toolbar.
 
 Drafts don’t appear in the announcements list nor can users see them. 
You can always edit your drafts later. Skip to the next section for more 
information on drafts.
 
4. (Optional) Add any file attachments or comments to the bottom of the 
page. These features are only available if you’ve enabled attachments 
and comments for the page.
 
5. When you’re ready to publish your post, click the Save button on the 
Edit Page toolbar.
 
Each post is its own page on your site. Click the Sitemap link in the Navigation 
box on your Sidebar to locate a specific post. You can also search for posts 
using the search box at the top of the screen.

Dealing with drafts
When you edit new announcement posts, you’ll notice an extra button in the 
Edit Page toolbar that reads Save Draft. Drafts are helpful when you write a 
new post and don’t want to publish yet. This gives you a chance to add, edit, 
or change information before everyone sees it.
After you create a new post, click the Save Draft button on the Edit Page tool-
bar. When you return to your Announcements page, you’ll see a link to your 
draft posts below the “New Post” button to the right of “Your Draft Posts” 
(refer to Figure 5-9). Click the title of a draft post to begin editing it.
After you click the Save button in a draft post, your announcement is posted. 
You’ll no longer see the Save Draft button when you go to make changes.
Deleting old announcements
When you finish with your old posts, or decide you really didn’t want to 
announce that surprise birthday party, you can easily go back and clean up 
your announcements in a jiffy.
 
1. Navigate to the Announcements page where the post you want to 
delete is located.
 
 
In the Navigation box on the Sidebar, click the Sitemap link to quickly 
locate your Announcements page.
 
2. Click the title of the post you want to delete.
 
 You are taken to that post’s page.

78
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
3. Click the More Actions drop-down list at the top of the page and 
choose Delete from the list that appears.
 
 
A box appears asking you if you really want to delete your post. Make 
sure that you really don’t want to see that post again because after 
you click the Delete button, you won’t be given a chance to undo your 
action.
 
4. Click the Delete button to remove your post or click Cancel if you 
decide you want to keep it after all.
 
 When your post is deleted, you return to the Announcements page.
Filling Your File Cabinet
A project can be simple or complex, but regardless of its size, your team is 
likely going to need to keep track of all sorts of documents to get it done. 
That’s where the File Cabinet template comes in handy. Any of your team mem-
bers can add documents, spreadsheets, archives, PDFs, music files, and so 
on, to your File Cabinet. The File Cabinet is also a great place to back up your 
important files in case something happens to your computer. All in all, the File 
Cabinet is one of the most useful templates on your site. (See Figure 5-11.)
 
Figure 5-11: 
Keep track 
of multiple 
files with 
the File 
Cabinet.
 
 
Each Google Site holds up to 100 megabytes of pictures, documents, and other 
attachments. For most projects that’s plenty of storage space. However, you 
may have to go back and delete files if your site stops accepting your files.

79
 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
 
Just as you can with a normal Web page, you can edit the title and body of 
your File Cabinet page. Click the Edit Page button to get started.
Adding files
Uploading your documents is a cinch. Just follow these steps and you’ll have 
everything you need for your project in one place in no time.
 
To add any of your Google Docs to your page, look at Chapter 6.
 
1. Click the Add File button.
 
 The Add File window appears.
 
2. (Optional) Choose the file you want to add from your computer. 
Here’s how:
 
a. Click the radio button next to the option for Your Computer.
 
b. Click the Browse button.
 
c. In the dialog box that appears, locate the file on your computer.
 
d. Click Open. You return to your File Cabinet page.
 
3. (Optional) Choose the file you want to add from the Web. Here’s how:
 
a. Click the radio button next to the option for The Web (Paste in 
URL).
 
b. In another browser window or tab, navigate to the file you want to 
attach.
 
c. In your browser’s address bar, highlight the URL where the file is 
located and then choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C on your key-
board.
 
d. Return to your File Cabinet page.
 
e. Click inside the first box and choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V on 
your keyboard to paste the URL.
 
f. (Optional) In the textbox next to Text to Display, type a short 
name for your file.
 
4. (Optional) In the File Description field, enter a brief description of 
your file’s contents.
 
5. Click the Upload button.
 
 After a few moments, the window closes and you return to your File 
Cabinet page. Your file should appear. Note: If you upload a file with the 
same name as a file that already exists in your File Cabinet, the old file 
is backed up and the newest version appears in the list. See “Tracking 
Files” later in this section for more information.

80
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
Organizing files
Life can get a little crazy at times, and your File Cabinet can quickly become 
overrun by unruly files. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to group files into 
folders so that you can keep on top of your projects or files collection.
To move files to a folder, check the box next to the file or files you want to 
move. Click the Move To button at the top of the list. If you already have a 
folder, you can choose it from the list. Otherwise, click the New Folder option 
from the list. In the New Folder window that appears, enter a name for your 
folder and click the Save button. Your folder is created and your selected 
files are automatically added to it.
To get rid of a folder, click the Remove link to the right of the folder name. A 
warning dialog box appears, letting you know that all the files in that folder 
will be deleted. Click the Delete button to remove your folder and related files.
 
If you want to delete a folder but not the files in it, check the box to the left of 
the files you want to keep and then move them to another folder. You can then 
remove your old folder without worrying about losing your files.
Deleting files
To remove files from your File Cabinet, check the box to the left of the file 
names and then click the Delete button at the top of the list.
 
After you delete a file, no one can access previous versions of the file until 
another copy is uploaded. All previous versions of the file are hidden, and 
there’s no quick undo option when you delete the file.
Tracking files
When a file has been uploaded more than once, the File Cabinet page auto-
matically archives the old version and replaces it with the new one. This is 
helpful when you want to keep track of progress on a project or look up infor-
mation that is found only in an older version.
To track files, click the little version number (v. #) link to the right of the file 
name. (The file shown in Figure 5-11 shows a v.5 link.) You’ll see a list of all 
the previous versions of the file, similar to Figure 5-12.
Click any Version link to open that version of the file. Newer versions appear 
at the top of the list. When you finish, click the Back to Page link at the top of 
the page to return to your File Cabinet.

81
 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
 
Figure 5-12:

documents.
 
Following changes to your File Cabinet
You shouldn’t have to check your File Cabinet every day to see what has 
been added and changed. Let Google Sites notify you automatically when 
changes happen. Click the Subscribe to Changes button. You receive an 
e-mail from the site identifying the file name and who added or changed the 
file. The e-mail also contains links that take you directly to the file or File 
Cabinet page.
If you don’t want to cramp your Inbox, return to your File Cabinet page and 
click Unsubscribe from Page Changes. You can also click the Unsubscribe Me 
link in any of the notification e-mails.
Tracking Projects Using Lists
The last layout available for your new page is a List. Everyone loves lists. 
Whether you’re going grocery shopping, assigning people things to do, or 
making sure that your project is moving along at a good rate, the List layout 
can help.
When you create a new List page, you have several predefined list templates 
to choose from, as follows:
 
✓ Action Items: After your high-powered meeting with your team, use 
an action items list to follow up. The default columns are Owner, 
Description, Resolution, and Complete. With Action Items, you always 
know what still needs to be done before your next meeting.

82
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
✓ Issue List: For projects that have issues in need of support, the Issue List 
is very helpful. Columns include Raised by, Owner, Priority, Issue, and 
Resolution. In a classroom setting, an Issue list could be used to keep 
track of student topics or questions.
 
✓ Unit Status: Use Unit Status to keep track of different items, such as 
widget components. (See Figure 5-13.) The Unit Status list has the fol-
lowing columns: Status, Owner, Feature, and Design (URL). The URL is 
useful for linking documents, Web sites, or order pages needed for your 
project.
 
✓ Custom List: Let your imagination go wild with custom lists. Choose as 
many columns as you like, name them what you like, and select from dif-
ferent field types.
 
Figure 5-13: 
A Unit 
Status list 
helps you 
keep track 
of projects.
 
To start adding items to your new list, click the Use This Template button or 
the Create a Custom List button under the template. You find out more about 
Custom Lists in the next section.
 
You can edit the title and body of your List page just as you would a normal 
Web page. Click the Edit Page button to get started.
Customizing your list
To make sure that your list keeps track of exactly what you want it to, 
you have the option of creating a custom list or changing an existing list. 
Here’s how:

83
 Chapter 5: Mastering Page Layouts and Tools
 
1. Click the Customize This List link to the right of the Add Item button.
 
 The Customize Your List window appears.
 
2. Enter the column name in the Column Name field.
 
3. Choose a column type from the Type drop-down list.
 
4. (Optional) Add a new column by clicking the Add a Column link 
below your column list.
 
5. (Optional) Change the order of the columns by clicking a column title 
and then clicking the white up or down arrow that appears to the 
right of your column name.
 
 Note: The column title at the top of the list will be the farthest to the left 
on your page.
 
6. (Optional) To delete a column or field, click the name of the column 
you want to delete and then click the white X that appears to the right.
 
7. When you’re done customizing your list, click the Save button.
 
 You can also click the Cancel button if you want to discard your 
changes.
Adding list items
To add list items, click the Add Item button. A screen appears containing 
fields for each of the columns on your list.
Here are some things to keep in mind when you fill in information:
 
✓ In textboxes, enter text as you want it to appear on your list. You can 
enter small items, such as names, or large paragraphs and descriptions.
 
✓ For check boxes, click the box and a check appears on your list.
 
✓ URLs use two fields. Enter the address of the Web page you want to link 
to in the first box and enter a short description of the page in the second 
box. The description appears as a link to the long Web address.
Updating list items
Lists change. While your project progresses or when tasks get accomplished, 
you’ll likely want to update your list items. Hover your cursor on the list item 
you want to change. Click the list item to make the Edit Item screen appear, 
as shown in Figure 5-14.

84
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
Figure 5-14: 
Click a 
list item 
to begin 
editing it.
 
When you finish updating your list item, click the Save button to return to 
your list. If you decide you don’t like your changes, click the Cancel button 
instead.
Deleting list items
 
When you finish with a list item or want to delete an item, click the item, and 
then click the Delete This Item link at the bottom of the Edit Item screen. The 
item disappears immediately.
 
If you delete an item by accident, don’t fret — Google Sites allows you to 
undo your last action. Look for the orange bar that appears at the very top of 
your screen and then click the Undo link.
Sorting your lists
Ordering your lists is a piece of cake. Sorting comes in handy when you want 
to group lists by people, dates, or other criteria. The Sort bar appears below 
the column titles (refer to Figure 5-13). Click the Sort drop-down list below 
the column you want to organize and then click the order you want from the 
list that appears:
 
✓ A–Z: Sort the column in ascending order. Numbers appear at the top of 
the list.
 
✓ Z–A: Sort the column in descending order. Numbers appear at the 
bottom.

Adding Gadgets
In This Chapter
▶ Enmeshing content from other pages
▶ Inserting content from other Google Apps
▶ Grabbing photos and video from the Web
▶ Browsing the Google Gadgets Directory
G
adgets are the bread and butter of Google Sites. They make it easy to 
add engaging content, share important files, and keep on top of proj-
ects. Add that you don’t need to know any computer code to add gadgets, 
and you’ve got a recipe for success.
Adding gadgets is a snap. When you’re editing a page, simply choose a gadget 
from the Insert menu, enter a few details in the window that pops up (such as 
how much space you want the gadget to take on your page), and voilà! Your 
gadget magically appears, making your site more useful than ever.
This chapter helps you harness the power of gadgets. You add content from 
other Google Apps (which you find out about in Part V), mix up information 
from other pages on your site, and insert gadgets that share information from 
the Internet, including weather, news, games, and more. By the time you’re 
finished, we’re confident that you’ll be a gadget master.
Inserting Gadgets
In case you missed it, gadgets on Google Sites are like mini Web pages that 
share specific pieces of information. Whether you use a dashboard layout, as 
we mention in Chapter 5, or simply share some information on a page, gad-
gets are sure to make your site more engaging. Figure 6-1 shows an example 
of a page with multiple gadgets.

86
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
Figure 6-1: 
Gadgets add 
punch to 
your site.
 
The process of adding gadgets is pretty straightforward. Basically, you open 
a page on your site, click the Edit Page button and then begin inserting gad-
gets. Although each gadget may deviate a little from the examples we include 
here, they tend to have some common elements we explain upfront so we 
don’t have to repeat ourselves.
Here are the basics of adding a gadget to your page:
 
1. Open your browser and navigate to the page on your site where you 
want to add a gadget.
 
2. Click the Edit Page button to enter Edit mode.
 
3. Click the Insert menu at the top of the screen and choose a gadget 
from the list that appears.
 
 An Insert Gadget screen appears.
 
4. Enter the settings you want to customize.
 
 Each gadget may have different settings, but a few common ones exist:
 
• Height: Indicate how many points or pixels (px) high you want your 
gadget. If you want your gadget to fit on the screen, keep in mind 
that standard Web browsers are about 670px high.
 
• Width: Enter the number of pixels wide you want your gadget. If 
you leave this number blank, the gadget will adjust to fit its con-
tent or stretch across and fill the column or screen.

87
 Chapter 6: Adding Gadgets
 
• Include Border Around Your Gadget: Check this box to show a thin 
border around your gadget. The color of the border will match 
your site’s scheme. To change the color, see Chapter 7.
 
• Include Title: Check this box and enter a title for your gadget to 
have that name appear in the top border of the gadget.
 
5. Click the Save or Insert button, whichever appears.
 
 You’re taken to your site and a placeholder for your gadget appears on 
your page. To see your gadget in action, click the Save button at the top 
of the screen.
That’s it. Some gadgets require a few more steps or details than this, such as 
a page or calendar; we walk you through the more complicated ones in the 
next sections.
 
To adjust your gadget settings later, click the Edit Page button on the page 
with your gadget to begin editing. Click the placeholder for your gadget and 
then click the Properties link in the blue bar that appears. When you’re done, 
click Save. From this blue bar, you can align your gadget by clicking the L 
(left), C (center), or R (right) links, and also turn text wrapping on or off.
Meshing Content from Other Pages 
on Your Site
Let’s face it — you can create a lot of different types of pages — Lists, 
Announcements, File Cabinets, and more. After a while, it can become over-
whelming to keep track of them. Although the Sitemap link on the Sidebar 
helps you find everything fast, and the Search Site tool points you to the right 
spot even faster, we know how nice it is to have all of your important infor-
mation together on a page. Chapter 5 introduces you to the dashboard page. 
Here we help you make the most of your dashboard and the gadgets you 
really need to keep your family, friends, or team on the right track.
In the next section, we cover the options you need to know to show off infor-
mation from your Announcements, File Cabinets, and Lists, and we show you 
how to create textboxes with extra tidbits for your visitors or collaborators.
Incorporating announcements
When you have an Announcements page, you can add an Announcements 
gadget to a Web page or dashboard to quickly show your most recent posts. 
This is particularly helpful for relaying your most recent posts to your family 
and friends or updating your team about a project, as shown in Figure 6-2.

88
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
Figure 6-2: 
Keep track 
of your 
project with

Insert the Announcements gadget as you would any other gadget. First, 
open the page you want to add the gadget to and click the Edit Page button. 
From the Edit Page toolbar, choose Insert➪Recent Posts. The Insert Recent 
Announcements screen appears. Adjust your settings, in particular 
these two:
 
✓ Show Posts from: From this list, choose the Announcements page you 
want to see headlines from. All the Announcements pages on your site 
appear in this list.
 
✓ Number of Posts to Show: Enter the number of entries you want to 
show.
When you’re done, click Save to add your gadget. Click Save on the Edit Page 
toolbar to see the gadget in action on your page, displaying the most recent 
posts from your Announcements page.
Previewing the File Cabinet
The File Cabinet helps you keep track of files, but like Announcements, some-
times you want quick access to the most recent additions or changes. The File 
Cabinet gadget, shown toward the bottom in Figure 6-2, lets you do just that.

89
 Chapter 6: Adding Gadgets
 
1. Open the page on which you want to display your most recent files 
and click the Edit Page button. 
 
2. From the Edit Page toolbar, choose Insert➪Recently Updated Files. 
 
 The Insert Recent Files screen appears.
 
3. Choose your settings and then click Save.
 
 Be sure to choose which File Cabinet page you want to show, and how 
many files you want to see. A placeholder appears on your page for your 
new gadget.
 
4. When you’re finished, click Save at the top of the page to reveal your 
recent files.
Abbreviating your lists
Use the Lists gadget to display the most recent additions or changes to a list 
on your page. This is very helpful when you want to keep track of how a proj-
ect is progressing or to quickly see what’s on your To Do list.
On your page, click the Edit Page button and then choose Insert➪Recent List 
Items on the Edit Page toolbar. The Insert Recent List Items screen appears. 
Choose the settings you want for your lists. Here, you have a few more 
options to keep track of:
 
✓ Show List Items from: Choose the list page you want to show items from 
by clicking this menu and clicking the page title.
 
✓ Select the Columns You Wish to Display: When you’ve chosen your 
list, all the columns from that page appear. Check the box next to each 
column title to show it on your page. If you only want to see a few or have 
limited space on your page, check only the most important columns.
 
✓ Number of List Items to Show: Enter the number of items you want to 
show. Only the most recent additions to your list will appear on your 
page.
 
✓ Sorted by: From this drop-down list, choose the column by which you 
want to sort your list items.
When you finish adjusting the Lists gadget, click Save; a placeholder appears 
on your page. Click Save on the Edit Page toolbar to see your gadget in 
action, with your list items all in a row!

Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
Creating your own textbox
When you have content to place on your page but don’t know exactly what 
to do with it, there’s one more gadget we like that you can use — Text Box. 
Think of this gadget as you would a textbox in your word processor. It 
provides a place where you can highlight a point, add a quote, or set aside 
random stuff that you just can’t find a place for on your page.
To add a textbox to your page, 
 
1. Click the Edit Page button on the page.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Text Box from the Edit Page toolbar.
 
 The Insert Text Box screen appears.
 
3. Use the Edit Page toolbar in the Insert Text Box screen to add any 
images, links, and other tidbits you want to appear. When you’re 
done, click the Save button.
 
 A placeholder appears on your page.
 
4. Click the Save button on the Edit Page toolbar to see your textbox 
with the rest of your gadgets and page content.
Sharing Information from 
Other Google Apps
If you’re using Google Sites to help your team stay on top of its game, 
chances are you’ve toyed with the other Google Apps. Specifically, Google 
Calendar is extremely useful in helping organize your time, and Google 
Docs is a perfect app to share up-to-date documents, spreadsheets, and 
presentations.
In this section, you discover how to add a Calendar gadget to your site and 
insert documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
Showing a calendar on your site
One of the most useful gadgets we’ve found shows events from your Google 
Calendar right on your page. Whether you want to keep track of meetings or 
let family know about important events, the Calendar gadget is perfect for 
keeping everyone up-to-date.

91
 Chapter 6: Adding Gadgets
You have three views to choose from when including your calendar. Week 
and Month views are useful when you want to dedicate a whole page to your 
calendar. However, when you want to keep things concise and not take up a 
lot of space, we recommend you look at Agenda view, as shown in Figure 6-3. 
Agenda view shows all of your events for the next 30 days with the upcoming 
appointments at the top.

Presenting a document, spreadsheet, 
or presentation
Google Docs is an online office suite with which you can create and edit doc-
uments, spreadsheets, and presentations from any computer with an Internet 
connection. One of the reasons to use Google Docs along with Google Sites is 
that you can share the most up-to-date version of your documents, spread-
sheets, and presentations on your site without having to re-upload files 
or constantly publish new changes. This is because when you save your 
changes to your documents online, your site automatically updates and 
shows the latest information.
The gadgets for documents, spreadsheets, and presentations actually display 
your entire document within a small frame on your page, similar to Figure 6-4. 
In the case of presentations, a small slideshow frame appears, allowing visi-
tors and team members to view your most current presentation.

more about Google Docs.
When you’re ready to share a document, spreadsheet, or presentation, here’s 
how to place it on your page:

Linking to your documents
If you don’t want to show your whole document within a gadget, you can insert 
a link to your document instead. This is particularly helpful when you want to 
share a Web presentation and have other users join in and follow along.
Here’s how to link to your document:

10. Click the Save button to save your changes and view your chart.
Gather information with 
a spreadsheet form
Another great use of Google Docs is collecting information from your site into 
a spreadsheet. This is useful for conducting informal polls, creating a mailing 
list, or having guests you’ve invited RSVP to a party.
This is a two-part process. To start collecting information, you need to create 
(and save your responses into) a spreadsheet. Check out Chapter 16 to find 
more about spreadsheets.

Grabbing Video and Photos from the Web
There was a time when the Internet was just about words — text on pages 
that linked to text on other pages. Although it’s true that most of the informa-
tion on the Web is text, video and photos have become an important source 
of information, entertainment, and sharing. If you don’t believe us, check out 
YouTube (www.youtube.com) or do a search on Google Video (http://
video.google.com) and see how many millions of videos are out there.
Showing video to your group 
with YouTube or Google Video
While you’ve browsed the Internet, you’ve undoubtedly come across a blog 
or Web site that includes a little video clip. Welcome to the YouTube genera-
tion. You can join in the fun and show off clips of your own on your site using 
the Google Video gadget.
Before you can place a clip on your site, you have to find the video clip first. 
Go to either www.youtube.com or http://video.google.com and search 
for the video clip you want on your page. Highlight the URL in the address 
bar and copy it.
Open the page where you want the video clip to appear and click the Edit 
Page button. From the Edit Page toolbar, choose Insert➪Video➪Google Video 
or YouTube, depending on where you found your original clip. The Insert 
YouTube Video screen appears. Paste the URL in the first textbox, adjust any 
of the other settings, and click Save to insert your video. Click Save on the 
Edit Page toolbar to view your video.

Viewing slideshows with Picasa Web
If a photo is worth a thousand words, imagine what a whole album of photos 
is worth! Google Sites is a great place to show off your photos, especially if 
your site is personal or shared with your family. The Picasa Web Slideshow 
gadget is a Google gadget for photo albums that displays images from Picasa 
Web Albums, Google’s free online photo-storage service.
Although we don’t cover creating Picasa Web Albums in this book, we recom-
mend you play around with it if, like us, photos play an important role in your 
life or project.
Managing your photos online and offline
Picasa Web Albums (http://picasaweb.
google.com) is a free service from Google 
that allows you to upload and share your photos 
online. In addition to storing your photos online, 
Google provides free photo-editing and photo-
organizing software called Picasa (www.
picasa.com).
After you download and install Picasa, it takes 
only a few clicks to enhance your photos, 
organize them into folders, and e-mail or print 
them. Best of all, Picasa syncs your photos 
with your online Picasa Web Albums so you 
can share them with the world, or more impor-
tant, add them to your site with the Picasa Web 
Slideshow gadget!

descriptions or long file names, you can click this option and they 
will appear in the presentation at the bottom of each photo.
 
• Autoplay: Choose this option to have your presentation cycle 
through your photos automatically. If you don’t check this option, 
a play button appears on your Slideshow gadget and visitors to 
your site will have to start the presentation manually.

Save button.
 
 A placeholder for your gadget appears on your page. Click the Save 
button on the Edit Page toolbar to see the Slideshow gadget in action.
Browsing the Google Gadgets Directory
Adding other Google gadgets is a snap. Google maintains a directory of hun-
dreds of gadgets that companies and users have created that put useful and 
entertaining tools at your fingertips. Some gadgets can even let you access 
information from all of your Google Apps on one page.

Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
Checking out the gadget directory
To access the gadget directory, click Insert on the Edit Page toolbar and 
choose More from the bottom of the list that appears. The directory appears, 
similar to Figure 6-7. (The gadgets that appear may vary because Google 
users create new gadgets all the time.) Browse through the categories, and 
when you find a gadget you like, click the gadget link or preview image to 
begin adjusting the gadget’s settings.
 
In addition to browsing these categories, you can enter a search term at 
the top of the gadget directory and click the Search button to find a specific 
gadget. If you’re interested in making a gadget for your page, search Google 
for make your own gadget or visit www.google.com/ig/gmchoices.
If you’re using Google Apps, you can create your own version of a Start 
Page by adding gadgets that give you access to your personal calendar and 
docs or allow you to chat with your contacts. The following sections show 
you how.
 
Figure 6-7:

Don’t confuse the following gadgets with the ones we discuss earlier in this 
chapter. Although the earlier gadgets let you share your public documents or 
calendars, the following gadgets are for your eyes only. When you open your 
site, the following gadgets show you your personal files and only you can see 
them, similar to Figure 6-8.

Chapter 7
Customizing Your Site’s 
Look and Feel
In This Chapter
▶ Using a theme
▶ Improving your site with site elements
▶ Changing your site’s color and fonts
Your site should be special, have a splash of personality, and be invit-
ing to everyone who collaborates on or visits it. Or, you can opt for a 
utilitarian approach, where function and a clean presentation are essential. 
Whatever your preference, Google Sites has a set of simple tools to make 
your site look just how you want.
In this chapter, we look at changing your site’s theme, choosing how the page 
elements appear, and tweaking the colors to match your personality or team 
scheme. Figure 7-1 shows a sample site where the logo, theme, and layout 
have been personalized to fit the needs of a classroom site. If you’re still look-
ing for ideas after exploring this chapter, check out Part IV for more customi-
zation goodness.

Sticking with a Theme
When you first create a site, you have the option to choose a Google-designed 
theme. Fortunately, if you’re tired of your theme or want to mix things up a 
bit for your team, you’re just a few clicks away from applying a fresh coat of 
color. These steps will have you going with a new theme in no time at all:
 
1. Log into your site.
 
2. Click the Site Settings button at the top of the screen and choose 
Change Appearance from the list that appears.
 
 A new screen appears, allowing you to adjust your site settings.
 
3. On the blue bar, click the Appearance link.
 
4. Click the Themes link.
 
 You see a large grid of designs used in each theme, as shown in Figure 7-2.
 
5. Select the radio button next to the theme you want to use and then 
click the Save Changes button at the top of the screen.
 
 To see what your site looks like with any of the themes available, click 
the Preview link below the theme title. A new window appears, showing 
your site with the new look. Before you save your changes, it’s a good 
idea to make sure that the theme you’ve selected is the right one by 
clicking the Preview button at the top of the screen.

6. When you finish, return to your site by clicking the Google Sites logo 
or the Return to Site link in the top-left corner of the screen.
 
 Your site now appears with your new theme, including colors and back-
ground images. If the new theme doesn’t appear right away, click the 
refresh button on your Web browser.
Working Magic with Site Elements
In Chapter 4, we explain the different site elements, including the header, 
sidebar, and body of a page on your site. With a little bit of tweaking, the dif-
ferent parts of your site don’t need to be the same as everyone else’s.
This section is dedicated to helping you customize the physical location 
of all the content on your site, as well as add a custom logo for your project 
or team. 
To begin tweaking your site elements, follow these steps to dig into your site 
settings:
 
1. Log into your site.
 
2. Click the Site Settings link in the top-right corner of the screen.
 
3. On the blue bar, click the Appearance link.
 
 The Appearance screen appears.

106
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
4. Click the Site Elements tab.
 
 The Site Elements screen appears, similar to Figure 7-3. Here you notice 
the Change Site Layout button, and options to adjust the Header, 
Sidebar, and Page Content. We cover these in this section.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Site 
Elements 
screen lets 
you adjust 
your site 
layout, logo, 
and sidebar.
 
 
5. When you’re finished making adjustments on this screen, click the 
Save Changes button at the top of the screen and then click the Return 
to Site link to see your new layout.
 
If your site has the Sidebar enabled, you can go straight to the Site Elements 
tab by clicking the Edit Sidebar link below the Sidebar on any page in your site.
Changing your site layout
Each of the elements on your site takes up a certain amount of space on your 
screen. Click the Change Site Layout button on the Site Elements screen to 
change how much space each of the elements uses. The Change Site Layout 
screen appears. This is where you’ll adjust the page.
The Change Site Layout screen offers the following options: 
 
✓ Site Width: You have the option to have your site stretch across the 
screen or fill a fixed width. A fixed width centers your content on the 
page, similar to a blog (see Figure 7-4). Enter a number and choose 
Percent to have the contents of the site stretch, or enter a number of 
pixels (700–900 is pretty standard) to create a centered page.

107
 Chapter 7: Customizing Your Site’s Look and Feel
 
✓ Header: Check this box to show the header, which includes your logo, 
site name, and search box.
 
✓ Sidebar: Check this box to use the Sidebar and Sidebar items, such as 
Navigation, Countdown, and other gadgets. Also, select a radio button 
to place the Sidebar on the left or right side of the screen. Additionally, 
indicate how wide you want the Sidebar to be; 150px is the standard.

After you adjust your site layout, click OK to return to your site settings. 
Click the Preview button to see your new settings in a new window, and then 
click Save Changes if you like what you see.
Choosing your site logo
A generic site shows the Google Sites logo in the top-left corner of every page 
you create. Although it’s nice to promote Google, we prefer having our own 
image there, whether a company logo, school mascot, or team photo. The 
page shown in Figure 7-4 has a school logo, and we think it suits that page.
Before you choose a custom logo, you must save the logo image to your 
computer and adjust the size to your liking. Acceptable logos should also 
be in JPEG, GIF, or PNG format. On a Windows computer, you can use Paint 
to resize your image, and then save it as one of these three formats. If your 
group has a logo available on the Web, navigate to the page where the image 
is, right-click the image, and then choose Save As or Save Image (depending 
on your browser). Name your image and save it in an easy-to-remember loca-
tion, such as your desktop or Documents folder.

108

Only use images that you have the right to use. You could get in trouble for 
using copyrighted and other restricted images on your site.
When you’re ready to choose a new logo, follow these steps:
 
1. Navigate to the Site Elements page in your Site Settings.
 
2. In the light blue Header box, click the Change Logo link.

 The Open dialog box appears, allowing you to find your logo on your 
computer.
 
5. (Optional) In the Open dialog box, locate and select your logo image 
and then click the Open button.
 
 After a few moments, your custom logo uploads and appears on the 
Configure Site Logo screen.
 
6. Click the OK button to select your logo and return to your site 
settings.
 
7. Click the Preview button to view your new logo on your site in a 
new window. If you’re satisfied, close the window and click the Save 
Changes button. Otherwise, close the window and click Cancel.

Adding Sidebar elements
The Sidebar is a handy location to place links, countdown calendars, or other 
gadgets that you want to appear on all of your site’s pages. Some elements 
can help motivate people whereas others let you see how your project is 
progressing.

Changing Sidebar elements
You can adjust your Sidebar elements to your liking any time you like by 
clicking the Edit Sidebar link on any of your site’s pages. When you’ve 
returned to the Site Elements screen, you can reorder, edit, or delete your 
items.
To reorder your Sidebar, click and hold the blue bar located above the ele-
ment you want to move. Drag the element to where you want it and let go of 
your mouse button. The other elements automatically move above and below 
your final resting spot. 
To edit an item, click the Edit link to the right of the element name. Make any 
adjustments you want. (See the preceding section for more info).
To delete an item, click the Delete link to the right of the element name. The 
item disappears. If you delete an item accidentally, click the Cancel button 
and your Sidebar will remain unchanged.
Sprinkling a Dash of Color and Fonts
In some cases, the themes provided by Google for your site may not be what 
you’re looking for. Whether you favor off-the-wall colors, lovely pastels, or 
something more in line with your school or corporate setting, you’re likely 
going to have to get a little more personal with Google Sites’ settings. 
Fortunately, changing colors is pretty easy. Although we won’t vouch for 
your own taste, we’re confident that you’ll find it a breeze to make changes to 
your color scheme, add background pictures, and choose a font that fits you.
 
The colors you choose are up to you. Before you begin changing colors, we 
recommend that you choose a theme that most closely matches your desired 
set of colors. This way you only have to adjust a few elements instead of all 
of them.
To change your colors and fonts, follow these steps:
 
1. Log into your site and click the Site Settings link in the top-right 
corner of the screen.
 
 The Site Settings screen appears.
 
2. Click the Appearance link in the blue bar and then click the Colors 
and Fonts link.
 
 Your screen looks similar to Figure 7-8.

3. (Optional) Adjust a site color element, as described here:
 
a. Select a site color element, such as Site Link Color from the list on 
the left.
 
b. Choose a color from the palette. Your new color appears in the 
Preview section. See Figure 7-9.
 
c. (Optional) Enter the color hex value in the box to the right of the 
color palette. If you’re having trouble finding a color code, check 
out www.colorschemer.com/online.html.
 
4. (Optional) Adjust a background image of the Site, Header, Page, or 
Sidebar title, following these steps:
 
a. Select a site element from the list on the left, such as Site Background 
Image.
 
b. Choose a background image by selecting the radio button next to the 
option you want.
 
 From Theme uses the background associated with your current 
theme. None removes your background image and uses the back-
ground color instead. Custom lets you choose an image from your 
computer.
 
c. (Optional) Click the Choose File button and locate a file on your com-
puter. When the Open dialog box appears, choose your image file 
and then click Open.
 
 
Like other image elements, your background image should be in 
JPEG, GIF, or PNG format.

 Chapter 7: Customizing Your Site’s Look and Feel
 
d. Click the Repeat drop-down list to choose how the image will repeat.
 
 Horizontal stacks the image and is useful for the Sidebar. Vertical 
repeats the image from left to right across the page and is useful 
for shadows or fades. Horizontal and Vertical repeats the image 
throughout the entire page.
 
e. Select a horizontal and vertical position by clicking the Horizontal 
Position and Vertical Position drop-down lists.
 
 Horizontal Position repeats the image along the left side, center, or 
right side of the screen. Vertical Position repeats the image along 
the top, center, or bottom of the screen. 
 
5. (Optional) Choose a font for your body or Sidebar, as described here:
 
a. Highlight a site element from the list on the left, such as Page Font. 
Your screen looks similar to Figure 7-9.
 
Figure 7-9: 
Select a 
font for your 
page and 
Sidebar. 
 
 
b. Click the radio button to the left of the font you want to use. Your new 
color appears in the Preview section.
 
6. After you choose the new colors, images, and fonts you like, click the 
Save Changes button at the top of the screen. Otherwise, click Cancel 
to leave your site how it was previously.
 
Looking for a good background image? Do a quick Google search for back-
ground images. When you find an image that suits you, give it a right-click and 
choose Save Image As or Save As (depending on your browser). Choose a 
folder to save your image in and then click Save.

Chapter 8
Bringing Collaboration 
to a New Level
In This Chapter
▶ Defining relationships within a collaboration
▶ Seeing your site through others’ eyes
▶ Keeping track of file changes, and page and site updates
A
t the beginning of this book, we discuss that Google Sites is all about 
sharing. Remember that the best wikis are the ones where lots of 
people share what they know about a topic, project, or event. Unless you 
plan to keep the site to yourself and have a one-way conversation with your 
visitors, you want to keep everyone in the loop and encourage them to edit 
pages and share ideas.
The previous few chapters focus on creating your site and perfecting your 
design; in this chapter, you bring the rest of your team, family, class, or 
adoring public on board. Here, we cover sending invitations to others, view-
ing your site from a public perspective, tracking updates, and managing 
subscriptions.
Defining Relationships
You can invite people to join your site at any time after you create your site. 
In fact, if you chose to allow anyone in your domain to edit your site when 
you created it, you already have some collaborators.
How people interact with your site is important. After all, you may not want 
everyone changing your color scheme, or some people making any changes 
at all. This section shows you how to invite others to join in and how to 
adjust your site permissions to allow or restrict access to whomever you like.

116
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
Only site owners can send invitations and change a user’s access privileges. If 
you are a collaborator or viewer, you won’t be able to make these changes.
Sending invitations to others
Invitations are the primary way for other users to know that they can view or 
edit pages on your site. When you add new users, you receive the option to 
send them an e-mail message. Invitees also receive the Web address of your 
site so they can start working on your site immediately.
 
Your site URL can become rather lengthy, especially if you’re a Google Apps 
user. When you send an invitation to others, why have them remember 
http://sites.google.com/a/yourdomain.com/site/page when you 
can create a shorter URL using a shortcut service, such as TinyURL (http://
tinyurl.com)? Paste that long address into the TinyURL home page and 
that long URL turns into something as miniscule as http://tinyurl.
com/4vw22u.
Here’s how to start sending invitations:
 
1. Navigate to a page on the site you want to share.
 
2. Log into the site, if you haven’t already, by clicking the Login link at 
the bottom of the page.
 
 The Edit buttons appear on your page.
 
3. Click the Site Settings button and choose Share This Site from the list 
that appears.
 
 The Site Sharing screen loads, similar to Figure 8-1.
 
4. Choose one of the permissions you want your users to have:
 
• As Owners: Owners can view and edit your site. They can also 
change site settings (including the look and feel) and invite other 
people to join.
 
• As Collaborators: Collaborators can only view and edit your site, 
and create new pages. They cannot change site settings or invite 
others to join.
 
• As Viewers: Viewers can only, you guessed it, see your site. They 
cannot make any changes or invite others.
 
5. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to invite.
 
 It they’re in your Contacts, their address automatically appears when 
you start typing. Alternatively, you can click the Choose from Contacts 
link below the box to open the Contact Picker (shown in Figure 8-2) and 
search your contacts.

 An e-mail screen appears where you can enter a brief message. 
Remember that a link to your site is included automatically in your mes-
sage. If you want to receive a copy of the message, check the box next to 
CC Me.

7. (Optional) Click Send to send your invitation.
 
 The message is sent and you return to the Sites Sharing screen.
 
8. (Optional) Click Skip Sending Invitation.
 
 A message is not sent, but your site now appears in their Google Sites 
list. They’ll see it the next time they log in (or you’ll have to verbally 
inform them that they have access). You return to the Sites Sharing 
screen.
 
9. (Optional) Rinse and repeat Steps 4 through 8 for each remaining per-
mission: owners, collaborators, or viewers.
After you invite users, they can view or contribute to your site. Your current 
owners, collaborators, and viewers appear in the gray box on the right side 
of the Site Sharing screen (refer to Figure 8-1). Click the Return to Site link to 
go back to editing your site.
 
You can change the level of access to users at any time using the Site Sharing 
screen. Follow Steps 4 through 8 above, using the new permissions level and 
the same address. When you’re done, your list reflects the changes you make.
Advanced permissions
While you’re on the Site Sharing screen, feel free to adjust the Advanced 
Permissions, which specify the permissions for the rest of the world. This 
may be helpful if you want different settings than those you chose when you 
first created your site. You can check one or more of the following options. 
Note: The first two options are available only to Google Apps users.
 
✓ Anyone at yoursite.com may view this site. Allows your site to appear 
in the list of all the users in your organization. Users are able to view but 
not make any changes to your site.
 
✓ Anyone at yoursite.com may edit this site. Same as the last option; 
however, anyone at your site can make changes to the pages.
 
✓ Anyone in the world may view this site (make it public). Allows every-
one in the world to see your site. If not selected, only those who you 
invite can see your site.
Removing users from your site
When a team member leaves or you decide to block someone from your 
site, you need to manually remove him from the Sites Sharing list. When you 
remove them, they can no longer access your site unless your site is public 
to begin with. Here’s how to do it:

119
 Chapter 8: Bringing Collaboration to a New Level
 
1. If you’re an owner, log into your site.
 
2. Click the More Actions button and choose Site Sharing from the list.
 
3. On the Site Sharing screen that appears, click the Remove link to 
the right of the e-mail address of the user whose access you want to 
revoke.
Seeing Your Site Through a Viewer’s Eyes
You are the owner of the sites you create, which means that every time you 
go to your site, you see the Edit buttons and can make changes. When you’re 
sharing your site with many viewers, having to log in and out to see the page 
how they see it can be annoying. This is especially true if you’re making sev-
eral tweaks to the page and have a specific look in mind.
Fortunately, you can quickly preview each of your pages as a viewer. This 
allows you to quickly see your updates with two clicks. From any page on 
your site, click the More Actions button, and choose Preview Page as Viewer 
from the list that appears.
A new tab appears, similar to Figure 8-3. In viewer preview, notice that the 
Google bar along the top of the page disappears, as well as the Edit buttons. 
This is how your page appears to all of your noncollaborating visitors.
 
Figure 8-3: 
A page in 
viewer 
preview.
 

120
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
When you’re finished with your page view, return to Edit mode by closing 
this new tab or by clicking any of the links on the page.
Tracking File Changes
With many people working together and making changes to the same files, 
sooner or later someone will delete something critical or your original idea 
becomes so thoroughly altered it’s no longer recognizable. Thankfully, 
Google Sites keeps track of all the changes made to a page since it was cre-
ated, which makes sorting things out much easier.
Conflict management
It’s generally not good to make changes to a 
page while someone else is making changes. 
Fortunately, if you try to edit a page that’s being 
changed, Google locks the page and warns you 
that another user is busy with that page, as 
shown in the figure here. A message appears, 
telling you who’s hogging your space so you 
can deal with him properly.
At this point, either you can be polite and click 
the Wait button, or you can be bullish and click 
the Break Lock button. When the other person 
tries to save their changes, they see an Edit 
Conflict warning, shown in the figure here, 
where they can either click Yes and override 
your changes or click No and leave you to your 
madness.
The moral of this story is that it’s usually better 
to wait and check with the other person before 
you attempt to overwrite their poetic master-
piece or reimbursement procedure.

121
 Chapter 8: Bringing Collaboration to a New Level
In the top-right corner of the page, you may notice a date or time attached to 
each page. This indicates when the last update to that page was made. To the 
right of the date you find the See Earlier Versions link. This link is key to restor-
ing information or reverting to an older version. In this section, we cover how 
to view, compare, and revert to older versions of a page on your site.
Viewing a past version of your page
When you click the See Earlier Versions link, a screen similar to Figure 8-4 
appears, listing the ten most recent versions of your page. To list even older 
versions, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Prev link. The list 
shows a link to each version, when that version was last edited, and who 
made those changes. You can use this information to find the specific version 
you’re looking for.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Browse 
through 
different 
versions of 
your page.
 
Clicking a Version link reveals what the page looked like at that point in time. 
From this new screen, you can quickly load other versions of the page by 
clicking the Version drop-down list and choosing another version.
To return to the latest version of the page, click the Back to Version History 
link at the top of the page. After you return to the Version History page, click 
the Back to Page link.

122
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
Comparing different page versions
When you’re certain that something on the page has changed, but you just 
can’t lay a finger on it, try comparing versions. The new addition or deletion 
jumps right out and you can rest easy.
From the Version History screen, click a Version link to open a version of the 
page. Then, click the Compare Two Versions link at the top of the page. A 
new drop-down list appears. Choose a version from the Select First list and 
another version from the Select Second list to compare changes.
Text and other items that were deleted have a line through them. Insertions 
and other added items are highlighted, as shown in Figure 8-5. If no changes 
occurred, the page appears blank.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Compare 
changes 
made 
between 
two different 
versions.
 

123
 Chapter 8: Bringing Collaboration to a New Level
From this screen, you can choose any two versions you like and look for 
whatever it is you’re looking for.
Reverting to an older version
When you find the older version that you want to restore, click the Back to 
Version History link, and then click the Revert to This Version link to the 
right of the version you want that page to look like.
When you revert to an earlier version, what’s really happening is that a new 
version of your page is being created based on that version. Therefore, if you 
decide you like a newer version better, you can still access that version later.
Keeping Tabs on Page and Site Updates
Who doesn’t want to feel like Big Brother occasionally? One of the most 
enjoyable features we discovered is the ability to receive e-mail updates 
when our pages change. You get that giddy feeling that comes from not only 
knowing you and others are using your site, but also from the joy of seeing 
what changes were made and how the site is evolving.
You have two ways to subscribe to changes on your site, which we show you 
in this section:
 
✓ Individual pages: Receive updates on changes made only to specific 
pages you subscribe to.
 
✓ Entire site: See changes made on any page within a site.
With the right subscription, you receive updates every time someone (includ-
ing yourself) does any of the following:
 
✓ Uploads attachments
 
✓ Makes comments
 
✓ Edits a page
 
✓ Creates a new page

124
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
As an added bonus, everyone who collaborates on a site can subscribe to 
page or site updates as well. (Viewers just have to keep checking manually.) 
This way, everyone is in the know, and that’s cool. Now that we’ve whet your 
appetite, here’s how you can join in on the fun.
Subscribing to individual page changes
Subscribing to individual page changes is your best option when you’re only 
concerned with a page or two and don’t want to receive updates from other 
pages. (Are you sure you really don’t want to see when Grandma updates her 
meatloaf recipes?) A few quick steps and you’ll be the first to know when the 
page changes:
 
1. Open the page from which you want to receive updates.
 
 If you’re not signed in, click the Sign In link at the bottom of the page.
 
2. Click the More Actions button at the top of the page.
 
3. From the list that appears, choose Subscribe to Page Changes.
That’s it! An orange bar appears at the top of the screen letting you know that 
you’ll start receiving notifications when the page changes.
Watching for site changes
In some cases, you may want to be notified when any of the pages on your 
site change. Rather than subscribing to all the different pages individually, 
follow these steps to subscribe to site updates in two clicks:
 
1. Open the page you want to receive updates from.
 
2. Click the More Actions button at the top of the page.
 
3. From the list that appears, choose Subscribe to Site Changes.
The orange bar at the top of the screen lets you know that you’ll start receiv-
ing notifications when any page on your site changes.
 
Don’t take our word for it. To test the notification system, subscribe to a page 
or site changes, and then edit and save a page. Finally, check your e-mail Inbox 
within a few minutes and you should see the update. The message looks simi-
lar to the one shown in Figure 8-6.

125
 Chapter 8: Bringing Collaboration to a New Level
 
Figure 8-6: 
An e-mail 
notifies you 
when a new 
page is 
created.
 
Managing subscriptions
We realize that very active sites are updated all the time and soon your 
e-mail Inbox can be overrun by update notifications. If this becomes too 
much for you, it’s time to let go. Unsubscribing is your only option — 
unless you have Gmail.
The easiest way to unsubscribe from a page or site is to click the 
Unsubscribe link in any of the e-mail messages you receive from that page or 
site. Refer to Figure 8-6 if you’re uncertain.
Alternatively, you can unsubscribe from any page directly with these three 
simple steps:
 
1. Navigate to the page from which you want to unsubscribe.
 
2. Click the More Actions button at the top of the page.
 
3. Choose Unsubscribe from Page/Site Changes from the list that appears.
A familiar orange bar appears at the top of the screen letting you know that 
your action has been completed.
 
If you still want to receive updates from your page or site, but don’t want to 
clutter your Gmail Inbox, we have a quick suggestion for you. To protect your 
Gmail Inbox from e-mail overload of the Google Sites variety, you can create 
filters to have the messages skip the Inbox and appear in the Labels box on 
the left side of the screen, as shown in Figure 8-7. This way, you know when 
changes are made, but you don’t have to look through all the updates to find 
your real messages.

126
Part II: Constructing and Sharing Your Google Site 
 
Figure 8-7: 
Filter your 
messages 
in Gmail 
to prevent 
Inbox 
overload.
 
We recommend that you use filters in your Gmail Inbox. Here’s how:
 
1. Log into Gmail.
 
2. Open an update message from your site.
 
 Messages from your site show the title of your site in the From field, as 
well as the subject. If you subscribe to updates and haven’t seen any yet, 
open a page on your site, make a change, and then click Save.
 
3. Click the More Actions button above your message and choose Filter 
Messages Like These from the list that appears.
 
 The Create a Filter screen appears with a list of related e-mail notifica-
tions. Your screen might look similar to Figure 8-8.
 
4. (Optional) To limit the messages to a specific site, enter the site name 
in the Subject box.
 
5. Click the Next Step button.
 
6. On the next screen, check the boxes next to Skip the Inbox and Apply 
the Label.
 
7. Click the Choose Label drop-down list to the right and choose New 
Label.

click OK.
 
 We like to use something along the lines of “Site Updates” or 
“Company Wiki.”
 
9. Check the box next to the Also Apply Filter to Conversations Below 
option and then click the Create Filter button.
 
 Your new label appears in the Labels box on the left side of your Gmail 
screen, and all new notifications will go directly to your new folder label. 
When new messages arrive, the label appears in bold and the number of 
new messages appears to the right of the label. Neat, huh? You can read 
more about Gmail labels and filters in Chapter 19.

Getting the Most

In this part . . .
I
f you’ve had a chance to take Chrome for a spin, then 
look no further than this part to find the tweaks you 
need to make the Internet purr. Two chapters here help 
you uncover Chrome’s power and finesse. With a few 
adjustments here and there, we help you take on the 
latest and greatest the Web has to offer.

Chapter 9
Perfecting Chrome Browsing
In This Chapter
▶ Teaching Chrome your preferences
▶ Playing the tab shuffle
▶ Mastering the toolbar
▶ Using the Page menu
▶ Perfecting bookmarks
▶ Using the Tools menu
▶ Searching with the address bar and the Omnibox
W
hen it comes to browsers, it’s time for something different. Let’s face 
it; we’ve all been caught in a slow, confining, crash-prone and bloated 
browser rut for a decade. To pave the road in a new direction, Google cre-
ated Chrome. 
When you first use Chrome, you’ll be surprised that things look and react 
differently from your old browser; however, in a few seconds, you’ll start 
muttering to yourself, “I like that,” “Why didn’t they think of that before,” and 
the ever-cheerful, “Nice.” In this chapter, we show you some of these ah-ha 
features.
Teaching Chrome Your Habits
When you first start Chrome, it looks stark — almost empty — as shown in 
Figure 9-1. Don’t panic; this is a good thing. Chrome is waiting for you to fill 
the void. Within seconds, you’ll start teaching Chrome your preferences and 
habits, let Chrome know the pages you want to see right away, and quickly 
turn the stark environment into the most efficient browser interface you’ve 
ever seen. 

132
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
Figure 9-1: 
Chrome 
starts out 
deceptively 
stark.
 
 
Every page you visit is remembered by Chrome. Your most frequently viewed 
pages are prioritized in the New Tab start page so you can get back to them 
in a flash. (See Figure 9-2.) To get your favorite sites into the system, try our 
60-second start that we explain next.
Try the 60-second start
Start by entering the Web addresses of five or six key sites that you visit fre-
quently. Enter the first Web address (URL) into the address box on the tool-
bar. The address box appears next to the little star — you can’t miss it. Press 
Enter or click the triangular-looking Go button at the end of the address box 
to download your page.
To enter your second page, click the + sign that follows the last open tab and 
enter a new URL in the toolbar. Enter one URL right after the other, glancing 
at the screen just long enough to see each of your pages zip in quickly, each 
on its own tabbed page.
 
Chrome starts searching for possibilities as soon as you start typing your URL 
by immediately launching the Omnibox below the toolbar. Watch the Omnibox 
for clues about the page you are looking for so you don’t have to enter the 
entire Web address. If you see the URL that you want in the Omnibox, stop 
typing and click it.

133
 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
 
Figure 9-2: 
Chrome 
remembers 
your brows-
ing habits 
and records 
your pre-
ferred sites.
 
 
If you can’t remember the URL to a favorite site, just enter search words 
describing the site in the address box on the toolbar rather than a URL. You’ll 
get a typical Universal Search listing of Google search results. Pick a Search 
result and — presto! — you have a page of related information. (Read the 
expanded Search Tips section, “Search Effectively with Chrome’s Omnibox,” at 
the end of this chapter.)
Chrome immediately starts analyzing your behavior patterns; therefore, your 
most frequently viewed sites will be on the new tab screen whenever you hit 
the New Tab button or the + sign. All the pages displayed as thumbnails in 
Figure 9-2 were visited within 60 seconds after starting Google Chrome.
 
Each day you use Chrome refines Google’s understanding of how you work 
online and prepares an increasingly valuable list of frequently visited pages. 
The most frequently visited pages are displayed as thumbnails on the New 
Tab page. Click any of the thumbnails to return to a page quickly. If you need 
to see all of your previously viewed pages, click the Show Full History link at 
the bottom of the New Tab screen. Scroll down the list that appears until you 
find the page you’re looking for. It’s broken down by day and every page vis-
ited has a timestamp to make searching easier.

134
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
Play the Tab shuffle
You can do many fun things after you have several tabs open in a Chrome 
session. First, you can drag tabs to the left and right, and change the order 
of tabs at the top. That’s very helpful in certain situations. For example, if 
you’re giving a presentation and need to view several Web sites, you can 
have them queued and ready to go in the order you want them to appear.
 
Another easy option with tabs is to drag them completely out of Chrome 
and create separate windows for them. Clicking and dragging on a page’s tab 
and pulling it out of Chrome opens a new session of Chrome, as shown in 
Figure 9-3. You can close the old session and still preserve the page you just 
dragged from the original Chrome session. You can then open more tabs in 
the new session and repeat the process if necessary.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Change the 
order of 
tabs or drag 
tabs out to 
create new 
Chrome 
sessions.
 
Tips on the toolbar
Chrome offers the usual Forward and Backward buttons on the toolbar. 
It also has a Reload button right next to the Forward button. So if a page 
doesn’t come in properly, or you need to update its content, just click the 
Reload button, which looks like an arrow that curves clockwise. (Look for it 
in Figure 9-4.) 
 
Next to the Refresh button is the Bookmark Star button. We detail the use of 
the Bookmark Star button in a dedicated section later in this chapter. At the 
end of the address entry box, you see the Go button, which looks like an arrow 
or a triangle. Click this button after you enter your Web address or URL. While 
a page is loading, the icon changes into a Stop icon; clicking that icon stops a 
page from loading. If things are coming in too slowly for your liking, click the 
Stop icon.

135
 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
 
Figure 9-4: 
Chrome 
offers a 
clean and 
efficient 
toolbar.
 
 
We present both of the menus shown on the far right side of the toolbar in 
Figure 9-4. The menu that looks like piece of paper bent at the edge is the 
Page menu. The Page menu is a combination of the File and Edit menus on a 
traditional browser. The other menu — the Tools menu — looks like a wrench, 
and is a combined settings and options menu for Chrome’s more advanced 
features.
Using the Page menu
The Page menu is found on the right side of the toolbar. This important 
menu, displayed in Figure 9-5, combines many of the features found on the 
File and Edit menus of a typical browser. To keep our explanations clear, we 
refer to it throughout as the Page menu.
 
Figure 9-5: 
The Page 
menu.
 
Here are the key elements of the Page menu:
 
✓ New Tab: This option opens a new tab. (However, it’s easier just to click 
the + that follows the previously opened tab.)

136
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
✓ New Window: This option opens a new browser window; in other 
words, this option launches a new Chrome session.
 
✓ New Incognito Window: Choose this option to go incognito, just like 
James Bond. More on this later.
 
✓ Create Application Shortcuts: This option turns Web page apps into 
easy-to-access applications. More on this later.
 
✓ Cut, Copy, and Paste: These options perform these three common Web 
text-, picture-, and page-editing tasks.
 
✓ Find in Page: This option locates a portion of text within an existing 
Web page. For example, you can search for keywords in a long article to 
find the exact quote you need.
 
✓ Save Page As: If you need to save a copy of a Web page to your com-
puter, click this option.
 
✓ Print. This option prints the current Web page.
 
✓ Text Zoom: Makes text on a Chrome Web page appear larger or smaller. 
More on this later.
 
✓ Encoding: Changes the character set used on a page. This option is 
mostly for sites that use non-Western characters, such as Chinese or 
Arabic.
 
✓ Developer: Views the page source and debugs JavaScript. You can also 
access the Task Manager here, which we discuss in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Report Bug or Broken Website: This option helps Google police the 
Internet by reporting bugs or broken Web sites.
Going incognito: James Bond’s browser
 
Unless you’re James Bond, we can’t imagine why you might want to view 
pages incognito. Albeit, when you go incognito, the pages you visit aren’t 
recorded in your History file. In fact, Google Chrome makes no record of your 
travels. However, the sites you visit do keep a record, and you should always 
be mindful of that. To go incognito, from the Page menu choose New Incognito 
Window.
Create application shortcuts
Zillions of new Web applications (called apps) are available online. Most can 
be launched and treated like the traditional programs on your PC by using 
the Application Shortcuts feature. Selecting this option does two things. The 
Application Shortcuts feature first creates a shortcut to help you launch a 

137
 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
Web app from your desktop or Start menu just as you can with any other pro-
gram. Second, the feature opens the app in a separate window for quick and 
easy access. Here are a few quick examples of apps to which you can apply 
this feature:
 
✓ Google Docs
 
✓ Google Finance
 
✓ Google Sites
 
✓ Gmail
 
✓ Lots more
 
Application shortcuts are made possible by a tool built into Google Chrome 
called Google Gears. In addition to creating application shortcuts, Google 
Gears also allows you to access some of your apps even when you’re not con-
nected to the Internet. See Chapter 10 for an example of this.
To make an application shortcut, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page that contains your application.
 
2. Click the Page menu and choose Create Application Shortcuts.
 
 The Google Gears dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-6.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Create 
application 
shortcuts in 
the Google 
Gears dialog 
box.
 
 
3. Decide where you want the shortcut to appear. Click any combination 
of the Desktop, Start Menu, or Quick Launch Bar boxes.
 
4. Click OK. (Click Cancel if you change your mind.)
 
 Your current app reopens in its own window and the shortcut link to 
your app appears in the locations you designate. Any other time, dou-
ble-click the shortcut to open the app. For example, the Google Finance 
App, when opened, looks like Figure 9-7.

 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
 
After you decide to make an app appear as a normal application window, all 
the links to your other Google services appear across the top. You’ll need to 
use the Sign In link in the top-right corner to gain access to your full range of 
Google Apps. You can now link to Google’s other apps like Gmail, News, Maps, 
or the Web. Click the More down arrow to link to Sites, Documents, and other 
Google Apps.
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Some of us are as blind as bats and need to see bigger type on our Web pages. 
The fix is built into Chrome. To make the font larger on Web pages, click the 
Page menu and choose Text Zoom. This opens a popup menu that lets you 
make the text larger or smaller, or return altered text to its normal size.
The right-click menu
Like most other apps, you can right-click a Chrome Web page to gain access 
to the popup menu commands. The popup menu changes depending on what 
kind of page element you click. For example, Figure 9-8 shows two right-click 
menus. The first appears when you click plain text; the second appears when 
you click a picture that is also a hypertext link. Choose the option you need. 
For example, if you want to copy a picture, choose Save Image As.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Choose 
commands 
from popup 
contextual 
menus.
 
Power over popups
There is another kind of popup that isn’t as helpful as the right-click popup 
menu explained in the preceding section. The Web is full of popup and pop-
under ads, spam, and malicious things that need blocking. Google Chrome 
blocks popup spam, advertising, and other windows that magically appear on 
top of or under a Web page.

140
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
However, some popups with specific interest to you may be a necessary 
part of a Web site you’re visiting. So that you don’t miss something impor-
tant, Chrome lets you know when a popup has been blocked by displaying a 
Blocked message at the bottom of the screen.
To access a blocked page:
 
1. Spot the message bar in the lower-right corner of Chrome announcing 
that the popup has been blocked.
 
2. Click the message bar once to find out more about the blocked 
information.
 
 This snippet of information can help you decide whether the popup is 
safe and contains something you’re interested in.
 
3. Click the Maximize button, double-click the message, or drag the mes-
sage into your Chrome window and Chrome will display the blocked 
information.
Getting the Most from the Fastest 
Bookmarks in Browser Town
Some of your most important sites can be bookmarked. Internet Explorer 
(IE) calls a bookmark a “Favorite,” which is a distinct departure from tradi-
tion. Bookmark is the preferred term used by the original Mosaic browser, 
Netscape Navigator, Firefox, Safari, and now Chrome.
 
Bookmarking tells Google Chrome which sites you value the most so you can 
get to them quickly. Bookmarks are added to the Bookmarks bar on the New 
Tab page. Chrome also creates a Recent Bookmarks list and places it in a 
column next to the Most Visited sites thumbnails (refer to Figure 9-2). What’s 
more, when you close tabs you no longer need, Chrome starts a new list below 
the bookmarks list just in case you close a tab in haste and need to return to it 
quickly.
Single-click bookmarks
Traditional browsers make bookmarking or creating favorites lists too dif-
ficult. Chrome simplifies the process without losing any of the functionality 
avid bookmarkers thrive on.
To add a bookmark, follow these steps:

141
 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
 
1. Open the page you want to bookmark.
 
2. Click the Bookmark Star button to the left of the Omnibox.
 
 That’s it. The page is bookmarked!
 
3. Click Close to close the Bookmark Added balloon.
Refining and editing your bookmarks
Editing a bookmark is easy in Chrome. Gone are the endless dialog boxes 
of options that must be tackled in other browsers. In Chrome, just open 
any already bookmarked page and click the Bookmark Star button. You’re 
greeted with a notice that the bookmark has already been added. (See 
Figure 9-9.)
 
Figure 9-9: 
Rename, 
remove, or 
edit a book-
mark.
 
In this balloon, the following editing options are at your service:
 
✓ Click the Name box to rename the bookmark.
 
✓ Click the Remove link to remove the bookmark.
 
✓ Click the Folder drop-down list to place a bookmark into another folder.
 
✓ Click Edit to open the Edit window shown in Figure 9-10. (More on that 
in a second.)
The Bookmarks Bar and optional folders
By default, bookmarks are placed in the Bookmarks Bar folder. These book-
marks appear just under the toolbar in the New Tab page for one-click access 
to key bookmarks.
However, not all your bookmarks can fit on the Bookmarks bar. To organize 
bookmarks further, you need to create folders. To create folders, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Bookmark Star button.

142
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
2. Click Edit in the bookmark balloon to open the Edit Bookmark 
window shown in Figure 9-10.
 
Figure 9-10: 
The Edit 
Bookmark 
dialog box.
 
 
3. In the Name box, change the name of your bookmark as needed.
 
4. In the URL box, enter or change the Web address of the bookmark 
you’re trying to update.
 
5. Click the New Folder button to create a subfolder of the Other 
Bookmarks folder.
 
6. Name the folder.
 
7. Click OK.
Place your bookmarks in folders
After you create your folders, you need to use them. Google’s propensity for 
simplicity is evident in how it handles your management of bookmarks as it 
takes the pain out of this previously tedious task.
Here’s how to place your bookmarks in folders:
 
1. Open any page you want to bookmark.
 
2. Click the Bookmark Star button.
 
3. Click the Folder drop-down list.
 
4. Choose your target folder.

143
 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
Deleting bookmarks
You have several ways to delete bookmarks. First, if you open a previously 
bookmarked page, you can click the Bookmark Star button and choose the 
Remove link. You can also go directly to the Bookmark bar and right-click 
any bookmark you decide to discard. From the resulting popup menu, choose 
Delete from the list and — poof! — your bookmark is digital dust.
Always show the Bookmarks bar?
One of the problems with modern browsers is that the toolbars at the top 
of the screen occupy a good part of the viewing area of any Web page, and 
take away from the online experience. Google’s minimalist tendency has 
tried to avoid stealing screen space with its clever use of the New Tab page. 
By default, this is the only place where you see the Bookmarks bar. That 
makes sense because the Bookmarks bar appears when you’re making the 
decision about what new page you want to open. This is probably how most 
people will want to leave it — keeping the Bookmarks bar out of the way, not 
obscuring the amount of screen space dedicated to viewing a Web page or a 
YouTube video.
However, if you want to see the Bookmarks bar on every page, right-click the 
Bookmarks bar in the New Tab page and choose Always Show Bookmarks 
Bar or press Ctrl+B.
 
Even if you’ve bookmarked hundreds of pages, you can use the search tool to 
find any one of them either in your history or in your bookmarks list. Chrome 
even keeps track of recently closed tabs, so if you close something acciden-
tally, you can restore it with a click. You can also search your entire browsing 
history for lost pages with the Search box.
Use the Tools Menu
The button that looks like a wrench opens a settings menu called the Tools 
menu. Click the wrench shown in Figure 9-11 to open the menu and see these 
essential tools:
 
✓ Always Show Bookmarks Bar: Allows the Bookmarks bar to appear on 
every open tabbed page.
 
✓ History: Shows a detailed history of every site you’ve visited online.
 
✓ Downloads: Lists all of the files you’ve downloaded to your computer 
using Chrome. 

144
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
✓ Clear Browsing Data: A helpful feature that clears out your browsing 
history, cookies, system cache, or password recall files.
 
✓ Import Bookmarks & Settings: Allows you to import any bookmarks, 
favorites, or settings from other browsers, such as Firefox or Internet 
Explorer.
 
✓ Options: Opens the Options dialog box, the details of which are 
explored in Chapter 10.
 
✓ About Google Chrome: Launches the copyright and version screen. 
Open this screen and Google Chrome checks to see that you’re run-
ning the latest version. If there’s an update available, an Update button 
appears. Click the button and restart your browser to use the latest 
version.
 
✓ Help: Visit Google and read the online Help files. There are some great 
videos and even a few cartoons you’ll find entertaining.
 
✓ Exit: Click to exit the Chrome browser.
 
Figure 9-11: 
The Tools 
menu gives 
you access 
to Chrome 
options.
 
History
Keeping track of everything is in Google’s DNA and the History feature is no 
exception. Open the Tools menu and choose History. A tab screen similar to 
Figure 9-12 appears. Scroll down the list and go back to any specific day you 
like. To open any page over again, click on it. To delete the entire list, choose 
the Delete History link on the right-hand side of the open tab.
 
Don’t scroll down looking for an obscure Web site you visited in the past. 
Enter a keyword and click the Search History button instead. All the pages 
related to that word appear, making it much easier to find the page you’re 
looking for.

Downloading files
Chrome opens a special tab, the Downloads tab, the second you download a 
file. This same page keeps track of every file you download during a session 
so that you can jump to any downloads you’ve initiated. Clicking the down-
loaded file once opens it. If you click the drop-down arrow on the right of the 
downloaded file button, you find more options in the menu that appears:
 
✓ Click Open to open the file.
 
✓ Click Show in Folder to open the folder where the file is saved.
 
✓ Click Always Open Files of This Type to open certain file types automati-
cally during the current session.
 
Now, this is going to sound repetitive — Google keeps track of everything, 
including every file you’ve downloaded, even files you downloaded weeks or 
months ago. To search for one of these lost downloads, open the Tools menu 
and choose Downloads. A Downloads history page listing all of your previous 
downloads appears, as shown in Figure 9-13. From this page, you can easily 
search for long-lost downloads.
On this tab, you can open any previously downloaded file by clicking its link. 
You can also locate the file from its online location link (or URL) or open the 
folder where the file has been saved on your computer. If you need to down-
load several files, you’ll find this to be a very useful screen.

Clear browsing data
Most users will never know or care about the Clear Browsing Data screen, 
but for some, clearing browsing data is a vital feature. To remove items from 
your browsing history, open the Tools menu and choose Clear Browsing 
Data, as shown in Figure 9-14.
 
Figure 9-14:

Select each category you want to delete or clear:
 
✓ Clear Browsing History: Clears the History file, erasing your tracks to 
where you’ve searched and sites you’ve visited.
 
✓ Clear Download History: Clears the Download history file.

147
 Chapter 9: Perfecting Chrome Browsing
 
✓ Empty the Cache: Deletes Chrome’s memory of the pages you’ve visited. 
This feature also clears the New Tab page of all your most visited pages.
 
✓ Delete Cookies: Deletes the little files supplied by the sites you visit. 
Cookies often provide authentication information to a site, track your 
activities and browsing habits, and create a personal profile for some 
sites that you visit.
 
✓ Clear Saved Passwords: Removes any login information you have stored.
The Clear Data from This Period drop-down list lets you specify exactly how 
far back you want to go for your deletions. You can choose to delete every-
thing or isolate the last day, week, or month for your checked items.
Import bookmarks and settings 
from IE or Firefox
Do you have a lot of bookmarks, settings, or passwords set in Firefox or 
Internet Explorer that you simply do not want to replicate? No worries. Open 
the Tools menu and choose Import Bookmarks & Settings. Choose either 
Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox in the From drop-down menu 
that appears. In the Select Items section of the dialog box, choose the items 
you want to download:
 
✓ Favorites/Bookmarks
 
✓ Search Engines
 
✓ Saved Passwords
 
✓ Browsing History
Search Effectively with 
Chrome’s Omnibox
You can use the Omnibox in the same way you use the Google Search tool at 
www.google.com. And, there’s no need to limit yourself to simple keyword 
searches. In this section, we give you a bunch of great ideas to help you find 
all the needles in all the haystacks in the world.

Uncovering Chrome’s 
Advanced Features
In This Chapter

▶ Accessing Google Docs offline and syncing documents with Google Gears
▶ Managing nonresponsive tabs
▶ Setting and adjusting options
A
fter you play with Chrome for a while, you’ll notice a lot more tweaks 
and options than meet the eye. In this chapter, you find out everything 
you ever wanted to know about installing browser plug-ins, using Google 
Apps even when you’re far away from an Internet connection, dealing with 
misbehaving tabs, and tweaking Chrome’s options. We’d throw in the kitchen 
sink too, but you’ll have to find another plumber for that one!
Dealing with Plug-Ins
Web 2.0 is made possible by a lot of cool technology, such as HTML, AJAX, 
Flash, and Java. Chrome is built to handle HTML and AJAX just fine on its 
own, but Flash and Java require special software to work properly. The plug-
ins are provided by Adobe and Sun, respectively, and here we show you how 
to get these plug-ins working in a breeze.
Installing plug-ins automatically
When you open a page that requires a plug-in, such as Flash Player, a 
yellow bar slides in below the toolbar indicating that an additional plug-in is 
required, as shown in Figure 10-1.

152
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
Figure 10-1: 
A yellow 
bar appears 
when you 
need to 
install a 
plug-in.
 
Yellow  bar
Click the Install Plug-In button on the right side of the bar to begin installa-
tion. A confirmation window appears. Click the Get Plugin button. The plug-in 
installer downloads and runs on your computer. You may have to click a few 
buttons to allow the installer to run.
After you run the plug-in installer, return to your Chrome tab and click the 
Reload button in the toolbar. The page should now show your added features.
Installing plug-ins manually
Some sites won’t allow you to install plug-ins quite as easily as we describe 
above. You can still get them working, but it may take a few more steps, 
listed here:
 
1. Navigate to the plug-in Web site.
 
 We list a few essential ones below.
 
2. Click the button(s) that say Download.
 
 You may have to click through a few screens and accept a license 
agreement.

153
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
 
3. Open the installer by clicking the icon in the Installer Bar at the 
bottom of your tab.
 
 The plug-in installer opens in a new window.
 
4. Click the Next and Accept buttons to install the plug-in, and then click 
Finish.
 
 The installer closes.
 
5. Switch back to Chrome and click the Reload button.
 
 Your plug-in should load correctly and show your interactive content. 
In some cases, you may need to close Chrome completely and open a 
new tab.
Here’s a list of plug-ins we can’t live without and where you can download 
them:
 
✓ Flash: Enables you to watch YouTube videos and play online games. 
Many Web sites also use Flash for navigation menus and advertisements, 
as well. Go to www.adobe.com/go/getflash to download Flash.
 
✓ Adobe Reader: Opens any PDF file you come across. PDF files are digital 
replicas of paper documents, including manuals and eBooks. Download 
the reader at www.adobe.com/go/getreader.
 
✓ Java: This is used on shopping sites for 3D product views, for some 
online games, and other tools. Go to www.java.com for more info.
 
✓ QuickTime: View high definition streaming video and virtual tours. 
Find it at www.quicktime.com. If you’ve already installed iTunes, you 
already have QuickTime.
Enabling Offline Access to Google Docs
Although it’s nice to have access to your Google Docs any time you’re online, 
sometimes you’re forced to work in the confines of an airplane or a room 
with lead-lined walls where the Internet is nowhere to be found. So how do 
you finish those last-minute changes on a document while you’re taking the 
train to the city or give a presentation where a wi-fi connection is nonexis-
tent? Easy . . . by using Chrome. Chrome, with the help of a built-in tool called 
Google Gears, keeps you in sync.
 
As we mention in Chapter 9, Google Gears adds functionality to Google 
Chrome. Basically, it creates space on your computer for your browser to 
store files offline, such as application shortcuts or your Google Docs. Google 
Gears is also available as an add-on to Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. 
Navigate to http://gears.google.com and click the Install button. Then 
follow the on-screen directions to install the plug-in.

154
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
Here we show you how to sync your documents, spreadsheets, and presenta-
tions in a couple clicks and help you manage your Google Gears connections 
in the Options screen.
Going offline
Activating offline access is just a click away. The next time you log into 
Google Docs from your computer, look for the Offline link in the top-right 
corner of your screen. Here’s how to enable Offline mode:
 
1. Click the Offline link in the top-right corner of your Google Docs 
screen.
 
 You see an Install Offline Access screen, similar to Figure 10-2.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Click the 
Offline link 
to enable 
offline 
access 
to Google 
Docs. 
 
 
2. Click the Enable Offline Access button.
 
 The Google Gears window appears, asking you whether you want to 
create a shortcut to Google Docs on your computer.
 
3. (Optional) Check the boxes next to where you want to create a shortcut 
and click the Yes button. Click No if you do not want any shortcuts.
With Google Gears enabled, the Offline link is replaced by a green dot and 
your Docs begin to synchronize with your computer. From this point on, any 
new document, spreadsheet, or presentation you create will automatically 
sync to your computer.
To access your offline docs, open Chrome and navigate to your docs as you 
normally would or double-click the shortcut you create in Step 3 above. The 
next time you connect to the Internet, any changes you made while offline are 
synced to your online docs automatically.

155
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
 
If you decide to use Offline mode in multiple browsers, you’ll need to enable 
offline access for each browser.
Turning Offline off
You may decide that Offline mode isn’t for you or, more likely, you’re ready 
to switch to a new computer. In either case, you can disable offline access 
very easily. Follow the steps below or see the “Fixing Pop-Ups and Google 
Gears” section later in this chapter.
 
If you have trouble with your offline access, click the Offline Help link in the 
top-right corner of the screen. This takes you to Google’s Help Center and 
helps you troubleshoot your hiccup.
Follow these steps to turn off Offline mode:
 
1. Click the green dot in the top-right corner of the screen and click the 
Settings link in the little window that appears.
 
 The Offline Access Settings window appears.
 
2. Click the Reset My Offline Access button.
 
 Your offline documents are deleted and are no longer accessible without 
an Internet connection, and the green dot disappears from your Google 
Docs screen.
 
You can always reactivate offline access by clicking the Offline link on your 
Google Docs screen.
Managing Unruly Tabs
Sometimes the Web goes awry. Whether a Web site is misbehaving or a plug-
in is getting greedy and hogging all of your computer’s memory, on rare occa-
sions you have to deal with a nonresponsive tab.
With other browsers, you have to close the whole program with some type of 
three-finger salute (Ctrl+Alt+Del on Windows and Cmd+Option+Esc on Mac). 
However, Chrome makes it easy to manage your unruly tabs without having 
to force quit the whole application, as we discuss in this section.
The Tab Task Manager, shown in Figure 10-3, keeps track of everything that’s 
going on in Chrome. Because Chrome is built on advanced technology, each 
part of the browser, called a process, runs independently. This means that

you can use the Tab Task Manager to stop a misbehaving tab or plug-in 
and the other tabs and plug-ins won’t even notice that anything was wrong. 
Google calls these separate areas sandboxes.
 
Figure 10-3: 
Use the 
Tab Task 
Manager to 
shut down 
misbehaving 
tabs or 
plug-ins.
 
To start the Tab Task Manager, press Shift+Esc on your keyboard or right-
click the Chrome title bar and choose Task Manager from the list that 
appears. (Who said Google doesn’t save you time; you only have to press two 
keys instead of three!)
In the Tab Task Manager, you notice three types of tasks and the amount of 
memory, CPU, and network that each is using. Here are the types of tabs to 
look for:
 
✓ Browser: This is the engine that runs Chrome. If stopping all the tabs 
and plug-ins fails, use a three-finger salute to force Chrome to shut 
down.
 
✓ Tab: Each of your tabs appears here. If a tab creates other tabs, they 
sometimes are grouped together in the same sandbox.
 
✓ Plug-In: Flash, Java, Google Gears, and more appear here. They some-
times get stuck and affect a bunch of tabs or cause Chrome to stop 
responding. Stopping a plug-in helps your tabs recover.
You can quickly identify which tab or plug-in is causing your computer all 
sorts of grief by looking for a very high percentage of CPU usage. Basically, 
your computer is trying really hard to make it work, but can’t seem to get it 
right.
Click a task you want to stop and click the End Process button at the bottom 
of the Task Manager window. Then return to Chrome and close or reload the 
tab that was misbehaving.

 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
Adjusting Options
Like any good custom car, Chrome can be fine-tuned to run at peak perfor-
mance and behave just how you want. Although the average person won’t 
need to change most of the settings, we still want to take a moment in 
this section to pop the hood and show you how to tweak your browsing 
experience.
Aw, snap!
As much as Chrome, or any browser for that 
matter, tries to be incredibly stable and secure, 
sometimes they are no match for the Internet. 
You have to realize that nearly 1.5 billion people 
around the world are connecting to roughly a 
trillion different Web pages. With all of those 
pages created by different people ranging from 
professional Web developers to hobbyists and 
junior-high students to governments, there’s 
bound to be one or two that Chrome just can’t 
handle.
Fortunately for you, when a Chrome tab does 
crash, it won’t bring down your whole com-
puter. Instead, you see a gray Dead Tab screen, 
as shown here. When this screen appears, you 
can either close the tab to keep working with 
your other tabs, or click the Reload button to 
have Chrome take another stab at the page.

158
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
To access the Google Chrome Options window, click the Tools menu (the 
menu icon looks like a wrench), and then choose Options. The Google 
Chrome Options window appears, similar to Figure 10-4. The Options screen 
is divided into three tabs: Basics, Minor Tweaks, and Under the Hood. Unless 
you have some major adjustments to make, you should stick to the first two 
tabs, highlighted in this section. As a bonus, we throw in some common tasks 
from the Under the Hood tab, too, in case you’re interested.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Change 
settings in 
the Google 
Chrome 
Options 
window.
 
Setting Basics
The Basics tab (refer to Figure 10-4) gives you control over how Chrome 
normally behaves, including
 
✓ On Startup
 
✓ Home Page
 
✓ Default Search
 
✓ Default Browser
Next, we explain what each option does and how to make adjustments. Any 
settings that you change take effect immediately.

159
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
Adjusting what Chrome shows on startup
Every time you launch Chrome, your choice of tab or tabs appears. The 
On Startup section of the Basics tab lets you decide which pages to load at 
startup. (Refer to Figure 10-4.) The options here include
 
✓ Open the Home Page: Click this bullet to open the Home page, which 
you select in the Home Page section. When your Home page is set to use 
the New Tab page, you see your favorite destinations when you start 
Chrome.
 
✓ Restore the Pages That Were Open Last: If you’re the type of person 
who likes to take breaks in browsing, this option is for you. When this 
option is selected, all your tabs are saved when you exit Chrome. The 
next time you open the browser, you start browsing right where you 
left off.
 
✓ Open the Following Pages: Choose this option if you like to visit mul-
tiple pages when you start your browser. You can add more pages to the 
list or delete the pages you may have added by mistake:
 
• Click the Add button to return to the Add Page list. Pick a new 
page from the list or enter a new URL by hand.
 
• If you’re already on the page that you want to appear on its own 
tab when you open Google Chrome, click the Use Current button.
 
• To remove a page, pick the page from the list and click the Remove 
button on the right.
Changing your Home page
Google Chrome doesn’t normally start by displaying a default start page. 
With most new computers, the manufacturer’s Home page appears, and most 
people don’t know how to reset it. They often are stuck with the same Home 
page for a digital eternity. To prevent this problem, Chrome begins with the 
New Tab page to make it easy to pick exactly what you want to see.
Okay, okay. The New Tab page may not work for you. If you still need to see a 
traditional Home page as the first page you see, you can make it so. To start 
with a set Home page every time you start Chrome, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Chrome browser and navigate to the page you want to 
appear as your Home page or start page.
 
2. Copy the URL from the Omnibox.
 
3. Click Tools➪Options.
 
4. In the Home Page section in the middle of the dialog box, select the 
Open This Page radio button and paste the URL (or type the URL) in 
the adjacent box.

160
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
5. (Optional) Check the Show Home Button on the Toolbar box to dis-
play a traditional Home icon on the Chrome toolbar.
 
6. When you’re finished, click the Close button to save your changes and 
return to your browser.
 
Quickly access your Home page by pressing Alt+Home on your keyboard. 
Selecting your default search engine
Even though we think Google Search is the best (we’re both slightly biased 
ex-Googlers), we realize that a bunch of other options are out there. If you 
find yourself going to Yahoo! or Windows Live often, and the search function 
of the Omnibox doesn’t quite cut if for you (see Chapter 9 for more about 
Omnibox search), you can set any site with a search box as your default.
To set your default search, look for the Default Search option in the Google 
Chrome Options window. Click the drop-down list to reveal the major search 
providers and choose your favorite from the list.
If your preferred search engine doesn’t appear in the list, you can still make 
it your default. Click the Manage button, and a screen similar to Figure 10-5 
appears. Any site you’ve searched since you installed Chrome appears in this 
list. Click a site from this list and then click the Make Default button on the 
right side of the screen.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Choose an 
alterna-
tive search 
engine. 
 
The easiest way to add a search engine that’s not in the list is to navigate to 
that site in a new tab and perform a search. Chrome automatically adds that 
site to your Search Engines list.

161
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
 
If for some reason that doesn’t work, you need to add your search engine 
manually. This is particularly helpful if you access your search engine through 
a proxy, such as for searching your university library. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. On the Search Engines screen, click the Add button.
 
 The Add Search Engine window appears.
 
2. Enter your search engine details:
 
• Name: Enter the name of your site.
 
• Keyword: Choose a keyword for your search engine. When you type 
that keyword into the Omnibox and press Tab, it will search your 
site.
 
• URL: Enter the URL for your search engine’s results page. To find 
this, perform a search for test in your search engine. On the results 
page, copy the URL from the Omnibox. Return to the Search 
Engines window and paste the address here. Replace test in the 
URL with %s.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. Choose your new search engine and then click the Make Default 
button.
 
5. When you finish, click Close.
 
 Now when you type words in the Omnibox, your preferred search engine 
is the one responsible for the results.
 
When you use other search engines, you may lose some functionality, but you 
can always search Google again by typing Google.com in the Omnibox, fol-
lowed by the Tab key.
Making Chrome your default browser
While you’re changing your settings, why not make Google Chrome your 
default browser? After all, do you really want to use any other browser? 
Do this from the exact same Options screen. Simply click the Make Google 
Chrome My Default Browser button in the Default Browser section. Now 
Chrome opens a new tab every time you open a Web link or go to browse.
 
After you choose Chrome as your default, the other browsers on your com-
puter will get jealous. If you decide to fire up Internet Explorer or Firefox, 
they throw up a dialog box begging you to make them your favorite. Resist 
the temptation, but if you ever click OK on accident, start Google Chrome and 
return to the Options screen to make it your default once more.

162
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
Making Minor Tweaks
Although the Basics tab allows you to adjust how Chrome behaves normally, 
the Minor Tweaks tab in the Google Chrome Options window (shown in 
Figure 10-6) modifies some of the behind-the-scenes functions including:
 
✓ Download Location: Indicates where any file you download is saved 
locally on your computer. 
 
✓ Passwords: Remembers your login and password information to sites 
you visit often, if you choose.
 
✓ Fonts and Languages: Chooses the language for your browser menus 
and options. Fonts can be adjusted to support Eastern languages, such 
as Japanese, and so on.
 
Figure 10-6: 
The Minor 
Tweaks 
tab digs 
deeper into 
Chrome’s 
options.
 
Relocating your Downloads folder
By default, your Downloads folder is located within your Documents folder. 
This keeps your desktop litter free — too bad it can’t help you with all of 
your other random desktop files. But if you use Windows Vista or Mac OS X, 
you notice you already have a Downloads folder in your Home folder. 

163
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
To start saving your downloaded files to a different folder, open the Minor 
Tweaks tab in the Google Chrome Options window. In the Download Location 
section, click the Browse button. In the dialog box that appears, navigate to 
your desired Downloads folder and click the OK or Open button, depending 
on your operating system.
 
If you’re the type of person who likes to save each download into a differ-
ent folder, check the box next to the Ask Where to Save Each File before 
Downloading option. This is very helpful when you download lots of e-mail 
attachments or other documents.
Remembering your passwords
The average person has hundreds of logins and passwords that they have to 
remember to log into Web sites. It would be easy to keep track of these if you 
could have just one login name and one password, but that’s just not pos-
sible. Trying to keep track of them all is a daunting task, but Chrome can help 
you remember your login information, if you want it to.
By default, each time you successfully log into a Web site, you see a yellow 
bar along the top of the screen (just below the toolbar) asking you whether 
you want Chrome to keep the information you just entered. (See Figure 10-7.) 
Click the Save Password button to have Chrome remember your password. 
The next time you open that login page, your username and password are 
filled in automatically; all you have to do is click the Log In button.
 
Figure 10-7: 
The Save 
Password 
bar appears 
when you 
successfully 
log into 
a site.
 
Save Password bar
If you don’t want Chrome to remember your password on a site, you can 
simply ignore the yellow bar by clicking the Close (X) button on the right side 
of the bar or by clicking the Never for This Site button.
To turn off the Password Manager completely, open the Google Chrome 
Options window, click the Minor Tweaks tab, and select the radio button next 
to Never Save Passwords. If you decide that you want to remember pass-
words later, return here and select the Offer to Save Passwords option.

164
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
Although saving passwords on your computer is convenient, you should never 
save your passwords on a computer that you share with others. Also, you 
should think twice about saving passwords to financial sites. If your laptop is 
stolen, for example, the thief could have access to more than just your per-
sonal files.
When you forget your password, which even people with the sharpest minds 
do, you can click the I Forgot My Password link on your sign-in page, or you 
can look in Chrome’s options. Open the Google Chrome Options window, 
click the Minor Tweaks tab, and then click the Show Saved Passwords button. 
The Passwords window appears, revealing a list of sites where you’ve saved 
a password, along with your username for that site. Click the site you want 
to remember and click the Show Password button on the right side of the 
screen. Your password appears directly below that button.
Changing your fonts and languages
Most Web pages these days use a special file called a style sheet that tells 
the page which colors and fonts to use when it loads. This allows designers 
to create the amazing-looking pages you’re used to. If a style sheet doesn’t 
provide which font to use, however, your browser fills in the blank with your 
default font — usually Times New Roman or Arial. You wouldn’t change these 
normally, but if you’re feeling particularly keen to a specific font or, more 
likely, want to show larger or smaller fonts, you can tweak those as well.
On the Minor Tweaks tab in the Google Chrome Options window, click the 
Change Font and Language Settings button to choose your own fonts and 
select a different language. The Fonts and Languages window appears, as 
shown in Figure 10-8.
To adjust these fonts, click the Change button next to the font style you want 
to change. The Font window appears. Choose your font, font style, and size 
by highlighting an option in each respective column, and then click OK. The 
three font types are
 
✓ Serif: This font has little tails along the top and bottom of each letter, 
similar to the text you’re reading in this book.
 
✓ Sans-Serif: This font is blocky and has rigid edges along the letters, just 
like the captions for the figures in this book.
 
✓ Fixed-width: This font uses the same width for each character. It is used 
primarily for logs or viewing HTML source code. In other words, you 
won’t see it very often.
Sprechen sie Deutsch? ¿Hablas español? You can change your browser lan-
guage on the Fonts and Languages screen as well. Simply click the Languages 
tab to see the language options available for Chrome, as shown in Figure 10-9.

165
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
 
Figure 10-8: 
Set your 
default font 
for Web 
pages.
 
 
Figure 10-9: 
Set your 
browser 
language 
and spell-
checker.
 
 
Some Web pages are available in multiple languages, and the box at the top 
allows you to set your preferred language. To add Spanish, for example, click 
the Add button on the right, choose Spanish - Español from the drop-down list 
that appears, and then click OK. Spanish now appears in the list. Click Spanish 
and click the Move Up button until it’s at the top of the list. When Chrome 
visits a page that has a Spanish language translation, the page will load the 
Spanish version instead of the English one.

166
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
To change Chrome’s language for tabs, menus, and so on, choose your pre-
ferred language from the Google Chrome Language list at the bottom. If you 
write most of your e-mails or blog entries in another language, Chrome has a 
built-in spell-checker for your language, too. Choose your main language from 
the Spell-Checker Language list. After you set your browser language, close 
all your Chrome windows and open a new Chrome tab to see the changes.
 
For languages that use different characters, such as Arabic or Japanese, 
changing the default encoding helps those letters display correctly (such as 
right-to-left). If you don’t normally visit sites in foreign languages, this encod-
ing setting doesn’t need to be changed.
Getting under the hood
 
This last section discusses how to adjust more-technical stuff, such as turn-
ing features on and off and adjusting proxy settings if you connect to a work 
or school network. We cover the most important options here. To adjust your 
advanced settings, click Tools➪Options to open the Google Chrome Options 
window. Then click the Under the Hood tab shown in Figure 10-10. Here are 
the basic categories on this screen:
 
Figure 10-10: 
Adjust 
advanced 
settings on 
the Under

tab. 
 

167
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
 
✓ General: Prevent downloaded files from opening automatically by 
clicking the Clear Auto-Opening Settings button. Help Google improve 
Chrome by sharing information with them by clicking the Help Make 
Google Chrome Better option.
 
✓ Network: Set your computer’s proxy settings for connecting at work 
or school. Let Google help you find your way when you misstep with 
the Show Suggestions for Navigation Errors option. Enable Chrome to 
preload links to other pages so you can browse even faster with the Use 
DNS Pre-Fetching option.
 
✓ Web Content: Turn pop-up notifying on or off by checking the Notify Me 
When a Pop-Up Is Blocked option. Adjust your Google Gears settings by 
clicking the Change Google Gears Settings button.
 
✓ Security: Enable or disable phishing and malware protection, manage 
certificates for secure sites, adjust your SSL settings, and set cookie 
options in this section.
Using proxies and pre-fetching
Chrome uses your operating system’s proxy settings to connect to the 
Internet. To change these, open the Google Chrome Options window, click 
the Under the Hood tab, and then click the Change Proxy Settings button. 
Your computer’s Internet Properties or System Preferences window appears, 
depending on your operating system.
In Windows, click the LAN Settings button, and then enter the proxy server 
information you received from your network administrator. On a Mac, choose 
the network service you use, such as Airport or Ethernet. Click Advanced, 
and then click Proxies and enter your proxy server information.
Fixing pop-ups and Google Gears
Pop-up windows appear when you visit a site that wants you to see a special 
offer or load a separate page. They can be a pain, but they sometimes con-
tain useful information. Normally, when a pop-up appears in Chrome, a blue 
“Blocked Pop-Up” bar appears along the bottom of the screen. (See Fig-
ure 10-11.) You can open the pop-up window by dragging the blue bar up 
and into view.
If you’d rather not see pop-up windows at all, open the Google Chrome 
Options window, click the Under the Hood tab, and uncheck the Notify Me 
When a Pop-Up Is Blocked option in the Web Content section.
 
Although most pop-ups are annoying, some sites will not work without pop-
ups enabled, including some online testing and financial sites.

When you need to adjust or disable sites that use Google Gears, click the 
Change Google Gears Settings button. The Google Gears window appears and 
lists all the sites for which you’ve given Chrome permission to save informa-
tion on your computer. (See Figure 10-12.)
 
Figure 10-12:

From this window, you can allow, deny, or remove any site’s access to Google 
Gears. The Allowed option is selected by default. Select the radio button 
next to Denied to disable the site from accessing Gears completely. Click the 

169
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
Remove link to reset the site. If you choose the Remove option, you’re given 
the opportunity to reenable access to Gears the next time you visit that site. 
When you finish changing your Gears settings, click the Apply button.
Staying secure online
Good Internet security is very important, especially if you do your banking 
and shopping online. Secure sites encrypt your personal information so that 
other people who may be watching your Internet activity can’t make sense 
of it. Using the right security settings can help protect you while you surf 
and keep your information safe. To access security settings, open the Google 
Chrome Options window, click the Under the Hood tab, and scroll to the 
Security section, as shown in Figure 10-13. Here’s what the options do:
 
Figure 10-13: 
Adjusting 
security 
settings can 
make you 
safer online.
 
 
✓ Enable Phishing and Malware Protection: Phishing sites imitate legiti-
mate sites and try to trick you into giving your personal information, 
such as bank account numbers and PINs. Malware sites try to install 
viruses or other evil software that tracks your computer habits and key-
strokes. Google keeps an updated list of known phishing and malware 
sites and checks to make sure that you’re not visiting one of them. With 
this option checked, Chrome blocks access to bad sites.

170
Part III: Getting the Most Out of Chrome 
 
 
Even though the phishing and malware filter work well, it’s still a good 
idea to keep your information safe. Don’t share any personal informa-
tion, such as your Social Security Number or bank account information, 
on a site linked from your e-mail. When in doubt, visit the company’s 
main page (type the www.company.com address) and call a customer 
service representative.
 
✓ Manage Certificates: Click this button to access your computer’s certifi-
cates. Certificates are used to verify a site’s identity. Browse through the 
Certificates window that appears and remove any certificates you don’t 
want to keep.
 
✓ Use SSL 2.0: SSL 2.0 is an older security protocol that is less secure. 
Most sites use SSL 3.0 or newer, so you don’t need this option normally. 
If you come across a site that only works with SSL 2.0, you can enable it 
here. However, we recommend you leave it unchecked.
 
✓ Check for Server Certificate Revocation: Certificates normally expire 
at a certain point, but some sites’ certificates can be revoked before the 
expiration date. This option checks to make sure that your certificate 
is still valid before you access the site. If it is not valid, Chrome blocks 
access to that site.
 
✓ Mixed Content on Secure (SSL) Pages: Some secure pages show infor-
mation found on insecure servers, such as images or text. Although it’s 
usually fine to allow all content to load, you can protect yourself from 
sending information to insecure sites by only allowing images or block-
ing insecure content completely.
 
✓ Cookie Settings: Cookies are little files that store bits of information 
from Web sites, such as your login or location so those sites can quickly 
load your personalized content the next time you visit. Most cookies are 
safe, but some could potentially track the pages you browse or the links 
you click. Cookie settings in the Security section include Allow, Restrict, 
or Block. Cookies received in Incognito mode are deleted automatically 
when you close the window. Click the Show Cookies button to search for 
and delete any specific cookies you like.
Starting over
If you end up making more changes than you wanted, there is a quick and 
easy way to reset your browser settings to normal. You still have to clear 
your browser data, as we mention in Chapter 9, but at least your browser 
should behave normally again. Here’s all you need to do:

171
 Chapter 10: Uncovering Chrome’s Advanced Features
 
1. Open Chrome and choose Tools➪Options.
 
 The Google Chrome Options window appears.
 
2. Click the Under the Hood tab.
 
3. In the bottom-right corner of the screen, click the Reset to Defaults 
button.
 
 A warning window appears, asking whether you really want to reset 
your settings.
 
4. Click Reset to Defaults once again and then click Close.

Part IV
Building Your 
Own Scheme

In this part . . .
K
nowing the tools you need to build your own site is 
one thing, but coming up with ideas for one is com-
pletely different. This part shares some practical ideas for 
creating your own site. These samples, which we call 
schemes, build on some common themes: personal, 
school, and business.

Chapter 11
Proffering a Personal Scheme
In This Chapter
▶ Going solo or keeping it all in the family
▶ Showing your face to the world
▶ Sharing your life experiences
▶ Entertaining your visitors with gadgets
N
ow that you have all of the tools that you need, it’s time to put them to 
good use and create something that is truly indispensable. Remember 
that the Internet is all about sharing. This chapter helps you connect the 
many aspects of your online life in one place using a personal scheme. When 
you share your life with your friends and family and allow them to leave a 
comment or two, everyone benefits.
In this part of the book, we use the term scheme as a plan for your site. This 
chapter contains suggestions to help you build your own personal scheme, 
which might include pages for photos, phone numbers, announcements, and 
family trips. If you’d like some ideas for an educational or classroom scheme, 
check out Chapter 12. Chapter 13 also covers ideas for building a company 
scheme, complete with wiki and file sharing if that’s what you’re into.
Here you see some examples of what you can do with Google Sites, but feel 
free to go off on your own and make something uniquely yours. When you 
have some tidbits to share, invite friends, family, colleagues, and co-workers 
to visit and add their two cents.
 
Before you go on in this chapter, we thought you ought to know a thing or 
two about sharing personal information online. When you create a public site, 
anyone can search for you and find out a lot about you by what you post on 
your site. This includes parents, children, employers, and maybe even identity 
thieves. Be sure that you wouldn’t mind these people seeing or reading about 
your party antics or antique abacus collection. And, you obviously shouldn’t 
post any super personal info, like bank accounts, passwords, or ID numbers. 
You’ve been officially warned.

176
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
Going Solo or Keeping It All 
in the Family
The ideas that we contribute in this chapter can be used in two ways:
You can either use them to create a personal site that’s your own space and 
that allows you to follow your own rules, or you can use them to get your 
family or friends involved to create a site where everyone can add their per-
sonal touches. Or, you can have a little of both.
Keeping your site to yourself
Think of it this way: In your own space, your main page will probably be a 
page about you, with links to more stuff about you, similar to Figure 11-1. 
Your site might include any of the following:
 
✓ A Profile page that describes who you are
 
✓ Your résumé
 
✓ A dashboard page
 
✓ A To-Do list
 
✓ An online backup of your important files
 
Figure 11-1: 
Fly solo with 
your own 
site.
 

177
 Chapter 11: Proffering a Personal Scheme
Gathering your family together
With a family site, you can create a main page for your family with a main 
dashboard that shows the family calendar and news, similar to Figure 11-2. 
You might also include pages for
 
✓ Family members
 
✓ Combined photo albums from individuals
 
✓ Holiday wish lists
 
✓ A family directory
 
✓ Interesting family folklore and other stories
 
✓ Shared recipes or scrapbooks
 
Figure 11-2: 
Keep your 
family on 
the same 
page.
 
The organization of the family site may be different from an individual’s site, 
but the basics stay the same.
 
If you want to keep your family site on the down-low and not share it with 
everyone, be sure to invite only the people with whom you want to share it. 
To do so, click the Site Sharing button at the top of the screen, and then enter 
your family members’ e-mail addresses. We assume you want everyone to col-
laborate, but you can always keep Uncle Joe from messing up the works by 
limiting him to “viewer only” status.

178
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
Showing Your Face to the World: 
Adding Your Profile Info
Your personal page shouldn’t require a lot of planning. Just start with your 
designated page (or sub-page) and add what you want. (For detailed infor-
mation on the subject, see Chapter 4.) If you’re not sure where you should 
begin, we suggest you create a profile or bio page. After you select a starting 
point, you can expand your site to include other pages. This section helps 
you get started with your new page.
Use a personal profile page to tell your family and friends about you. Here are 
a few suggestions of what to include, similar to what you see in Figure 11-3. 
We suggest using a bullet list or a table and fill in the items that make you 
cool, special, or freaking awesome.

Staying in touch from far away
Because you only need Internet access to add 
or change pages on your site, it’s really simple 
for family members to keep everyone in the loop. 
When Alex is in college across the country, he 
can post news of his adventures and find out 
whom his sister’s dating this week. Mom can 
plan her well-deserved vacation on the family 
calendar and, while she’s there, she can let 
the family know she’s extended the vacation a 
week longer than she originally planned. And if 
Josey loses her phone, she can quickly look up 
her sibling’s phone numbers in the family direc-
tory. After all, do you know anyone who still 
memorizes people’s phone numbers?

Figure 11-3: 
Create a site 
to tell the 
world about 
you.
 
 
You may already have profile information scattered throughout the Web. 
Rather than create it from scratch, link your site to your existing sources. For 
example, Facebook and MySpace allow you to add or embed your profile info 
to any site you want. Why not add it to yours?
Sharing Your Life Experiences
When it comes to your experiences, a picture is worth a thousand words and 
videos count for just about the same. The latest digital cameras can capture 
both pictures and videos, which makes sharing them on your site very easy. 
When you have a profile page in place, it’s time to expand your virtual self by 
using the Google Sites Slideshow and YouTube gadgets, and create a multi-
media page to act as your personal hub. This section helps you organize your 
gadgets. When you finish that, you can move on to lists and File Cabinets.
 
You can add your photo presentations, YouTube videos, or regular images 
anywhere on a page, which we discuss in Chapters 4 and 6. Add a gadget or 
create a new page with a Dashboard template and you’ll be showing off in no 
time flat.
Adding a photo gadget or two
Start with your photos. As we cover in Chapter 6, you can show off photo 
presentations by using the Picasa Web Slideshow gadget, which connects to 
Google’s free photo-hosting service.

180
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
Here’s all you have to do to add your photos to your site:
 
1. Start by uploading your photos to Picasa Web Albums.
 
 You can find more about how to do that at http://picasaweb.
google.com.
 
2. Copy the address of the Picasa Web Album you want to share.
 
3. Return to your multimedia page and insert a Picasa Web Slideshow 
gadget or click one of the gadget placeholders and choose Picasa Web 
Slideshow from the list that appears.
 
4. Paste the album address you copied in Step 2, choose your gadget 
settings, and then click Save.
Inserting badges from social networks
Many social networking sites allow you to dis-
play your profile information on your personal 
site. We don’t cover all social networking sites, 
but here’s an example of how to add a vertical 
Facebook profile badge to your site’s Sidebar. 
Other sites may be similar.
 1. Log into your Facebook account.
 2. Click the Profile link in the blue bar at the 
top of the page.
 3. Scroll to the bottom of the column on the 
left and click the Create a Profile Badge 
link.
 4. On the Badges screen that appears, click 
the Blog Badge link.
 
 The Custom Badge screen loads, shown 
here:
 5. Customize your badge by adding and 
removing different information. For the 
Format option, select the radio button next 
to Image. (The JavaScript doesn’t work on 
Sites.)
 6. Click the Save button.
 
 A screen appears, showing your completed 
badge with some HTML code.
 7. Select the HTML code from the textbox and 
copy it (Ctrl+C).
 8. Return to your site and click the Edit 
Sidebar link at the bottom of your Sidebar 
column.
 9. On the Appearance screen, click the Add a 
Sidebar Item link.
 10. Find the Text element in the list that 
appears and click the Add button.
 11. Click the Edit link on your new Text Sidebar 
element.
 12. On the Configure Textbox screen, click the 
HTML button.
 13. Paste your code into the HTML textbox 
(Ctrl+V) and click the Update button to 
return to the Configure Textbox screen.
 14. Click OK to return to the Appearance 
screen.
 15. Click Save Changes in the top-right corner 
of the screen and then click the Return to 
Site link to return to your site.
When you complete these steps, your site’s 
Sidebar looks similar to Figure 11-3.

181
 Chapter 11: Proffering a Personal Scheme
Broadcasting yourself
Getting your videos online is fairly painless, too. And who doesn’t want to 
see your latest undersea adventure? We talk about the YouTube gadget in 
Chapter 6, but here’s the quick way to add your video to your site:
 
1. Upload your video clip to YouTube.
 
 If you’ve never uploaded a clip before, follow the helpful tutorials found 
at www.youtube.com. 
 
2. Open your video clip on YouTube and copy the Web address.
 
3. Return to your multimedia page and insert a YouTube Video gadget.
 
4. Paste the album address you copied in Step 2, select your gadget 
settings, and then click Save.
Creating a virtual fridge
When it comes to sharing photos with your family, Google Sites allows you to 
create the ultimate refrigerator, like the one shown in Figure 11-4. Start with 
a dashboard page and different family members can simply edit the page and 
add their own Picasa Web Album or YouTube video. This page becomes your 
hub for family happenings. Just don’t tell your real refrigerator . . . it might 
start feeling a little withdrawal.

Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
Keeping track of To-Do lists and digits
Your high school English teacher probably told you, “Goals that aren’t 
written down are just wishes.” Well now’s your chance to take control and 
see what you can do with your life. With a List template, creating a To-Do 
list can help you get the motivation you need to go out and do stuff. If you’re 
trying to decide what your list should look like, try some of these column 
header ideas:
 
✓ Goal
 
✓ Requirements
 
✓ Projected deadline
 
✓ Accomplished
Next, forget about the Rolodex or wipe-off board. Why not choose a more 
permanent place for everyone to connect? Creating a family directory is a 
great way to find addresses to send good old-fashioned holiday cards or 
thank you notes. Use a List template to keep track of phone numbers, as well. 
That way when you lose your phone (or get a new one) you can still find your 
important numbers easily. Here are some suggested column titles, as shown 
in Figure 11-5:
 
✓ Name
 
✓ Address
 
✓ Phone Number
 
✓ E-mail
Figure 11-5:

numbers.
 

183
 Chapter 11: Proffering a Personal Scheme
Because lists allow links, you can link home addresses to Google Maps or set 
e-mail addresses to send new messages automatically when clicked. You may 
even find more useful information to keep track of.
Planning that trip of a lifetime
While we’re on the subject of goals and coordinating info, we find that Google 
Sites helps us organize big family vacations or other events by sharing links, 
itineraries, and lists of people that are going, similar to the site shown in 
Figure 11-6.
On your vacation page, make changes to your itinerary in one place so 
everyone has the latest information. In a second column, add links to travel 
information, weather reports, or other useful sites that can help everyone 
have the best trip possible. Then insert a Spreadsheet Form gadget so 
everyone can RSVP if you don’t know for sure who’s planning to show.
 
Figure 11-6:

vacation.
 
Entertaining Your Visitors with Gadgets
As our final suggestion for a page to add to your personal scheme, think 
about your favorite gadgets. If you’re like us, you may like to spend a few 
minutes each day keeping your mind fresh with word games or checking the 

184
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
local weather for your dream vacation destination. Plenty of Google Gadgets 
fit the bill. Group them all onto a single page to let other people know what 
you’re checking out; similar to the Games page we created, as shown in 
Figure 11-7.

▶ Adding a File Cabinet
▶ Adding a List page
W
e believe that one of the best uses for Google Sites is to aid college 
courses or school classrooms by giving students and faculty alike a 
place to share ideas and keep on top of assignments and projects. Whether 
you’re a researcher or leading a study group, you’ll benefit from the arsenal 
of ideas in this chapter for getting the most out of Google Sites and, by 
extension, the other Google Apps.
In this chapter, we first help you identify your audience and then suggest 
some layouts for you to consider based on the needs of your course. Unlike 
the personal scheme in Chapter 11 or the business scheme in Chapter 13, 
the college course scheme focuses on the unique needs of a classroom.
 
When it comes to designing your college course scheme, we suggest you 
follow a few basic steps:
 
1. Analyze your audience.
 
2. Consider site elements and gather ideas.
 
3. Sketch your pages and diagram your sitemap.
 
4. Create.
Analyzing College Course Schemes
When designing a site scheme, everything starts with audience analysis. 
Take a few minutes to think about with whom you’re communicating. For this 

186
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
example scheme, put yourself in the role of a college professor or a high-
school teacher getting ready to teach several 11th or 12th grade college prep 
classes. In this role, you have several audiences: students, teaching peers, 
and supervisors. Knowing this, ask a few questions:
 
✓ What are your audiences’ needs?
 
✓ What are their expectations?
 
✓ What are the benefits that can come from this site?
Supervisors are looking for a demonstration of professional competence. 
Teaching peers are looking to coordinate efforts and to share information. 
But for a college course, the needs of students matter most. Let’s get the 
analysis rolling by examining Figure 12-1. Here you see a Google Site for a 
course in computer augmented accounting. This is an undergraduate course 
taught in a major university. Analyzing sites like this can help you plan 
Google Sites of your own.
Figure 12-1:
A site 
page for a 
computer 
augmented 
accounting 
course.
 
Considering site elements 
and gathering ideas
The computer augmented accounting course in Figure 12-1 offers valuable 
elements to help students on just its first page, including:

187
 Chapter 12: Building a College Course Scheme
 
✓ Course announcements
 
✓ Lecture notes
 
✓ Calendar with course schedule and deadlines
Additional site elements for college-level course sites usually include:
 
✓ A course outline or syllabus
 
✓ Links to course-related Web sites or test prep sites
 
✓ A page containing useful files, such as study guides or multimedia 
downloads
 
✓ Relevant gadgets and online tools
Lists, like those above, get you heading in the right direction and give you a 
pretty good idea of what your workload will be.
Looking at Web page, File Cabinet, 
and List page templates
The next step is to visualize what your course site can look like page by page. 
Again, the best place to go for ideas is online. Figure 12-2 shows a Web page 
prepared for a Political Science 1100 course taught in the fall of 2008 — the 
semester of the historic 2008 election. This page offers a few additional ideas, 
such as:
 
✓ Counter gadgets with countdowns to Election Day and the Democratic 
and Republican national conventions
 
✓ Links to the Web sites of the two nominees
 
✓ An Electoral College map
 
✓ Links to polling sites, political news sources, and other research sources 
for election analysis
 
✓ An RSS News Feed Gadget that gathers political news stories
The Web page template is just one of several alternatives. Two other styles, 
File Cabinet (see Figure 12-3) and List page (see Figure 12-4) have been 
applied to this college course site as well. The File Cabinet allows the upload-
ing and downloading of files critical to a college course. In Figure 12-3, study 
guides for various exams have been posted for student download. They also 
have been organized into folders to correspond with upcoming exams.

The List page, seen in Figure 12-4, is a bit more obscure; however, in this case 
it solves a unique problem. A rather detailed list of reading assignments for 
two separate textbooks has been created so that students always know 
where they stand in regard to those assignments. This replaces a paper hand-
out that many students lose or that becomes obsolete when assignments are 
modified.
Jump to the “Adding Web Page, File Cabinet, and List Page Elements” section 
near the end of this chapter to find out how to create pages using each of 
these template styles.

189
 Chapter 12: Building a College Course Scheme
 
Figure 12-4: 
A List page.
 
Sketching your pages and diagramming 
your sitemap
The Web page, File Cabinet, and List page sites depicted in Figures 12-2, 12-3, 
and 12-4 were sketched in advance on the back of napkins. (See Figure 12-5.) 
You can use paper or your PC drawing tools. However, because we do most 
of our design work at extended coffee breaks, napkins are our preferred Web 
site design media. (Why do we always draw on the “back of napkins” when 
both sides are pretty much the same?)
The minute your site spreads to more than one page, you need to diagram 
your site’s navigation map. A sitemap shows the relationships between pages 
in a hierarchy. While you create pages, Google Sites keeps track of them in its 
own sitemap. In the sitemap shown in Figure 12-6, the instructor is teaching 
three courses. Each course has a unique starting page (History 1100, History 
1700, and Political Science 1100) with one to four sub-pages. If you draw out 
and diagram the relationship between the pages, defining the navigation 
strategy for your site will be easier.
 
You can’t possibly anticipate everything you’ll need on a site in advance. 
Fortunately, Google Sites is very forgiving and you can modify things as you 
discover new needs and audience expectations.

Setting Site Settings
With your page designs and sitemap roughed out (at least in your head if not 
on paper or on your PC) it’s time to develop the site. To begin, you need to 
set up the security rights for site participants. Then you apply appearance 
themes and navigation features. Finally, you create and flesh out your pages. 
The next few sections discuss these points in detail.
Setting up site rights and security
Each site needs a security plan. Normally, in a college scheme, anyone 
(including supervisors and other faculty members) is allowed access to view 
the site, but not to edit it, as shown in Figure 12-7. However, the site must be 

191
 Chapter 12: Building a College Course Scheme
public so that students can access it online. For this reason, the Advanced 
Permissions settings are very important for a college course site. Here’s how 
to set up the security to work for student access:
 
1. Select Site Settings at the top of your Google Sites screen.
 
2. Click the Sharing tab shown in Figure 12-7.
 
3. (Optional) If you want to let specific people know that your site is 
available for them, select the As Viewers radio button and enter the 
e-mail addresses of any supervisors and peers you want to invite to 
view the site.
 
4. In the Advanced Permissions section, choose View from the Anyone at 
Domain Name May View/Edit This Site drop-down box.
 
5. (Optional) To make the site open to all students without requiring 
them to log in, select the Anyone in the World May View This Site 
(Make It Public) check box.
 
6. Click the Invite These People button to send an e-mail message 
inviting colleagues and supervisors to view your site.
 
If you’re a Google Apps user and find that you cannot make your site public, 
chances are good the problem is your security settings. Your Google Apps 
administrator will need to change a few settings for all users of the same 
Apps-supported domain. When a Google Apps administrator enables Google 
Sites for new users, he’s able to define security settings. In the Service Settings 
section under the General tab, sharing options can be optimized. Normal 
users will not see this screen. Your Apps administrator must choose one 
of the Users Can Share options in the Sharing Options list, and then mark the 
box below the list stating that Users Can Make Sites Public. Of course, the 
administrator will need to save the settings.

site’s secu-
rity settings

Sharing tab.
 

192
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
Picking a name and defining 
your site settings
If you’re creating a site from scratch, you’re guided to name your site and 
choose key settings right off the bat. Start by logging into your Google Sites 
Home, as explained in Chapter 4, and then click the Create New Site button. 
At that point, you can name and describe your site, limit access if necessary 
by selecting the Only People I Specify Can View This Site option, and pick a 
site theme, as shown in Figure 12-8. After you pick your settings, save them, 
and your site is created automatically.
Don’t worry about getting every setting right when you first create your site. 
You can always change your mind, as we show you in the pages that follow.
 
Figure 12-8: 
Modify your 
initial 
settings.
 
Improving your site’s appearance
After you create your initial site, you’re free to make changes and to dig 
deeper into Google Sites’ capabilities. For example, adjusting the color 
scheme and changing the Sidebar and Header elements is painless and quite 
fun. For a college scheme, most instructors pick school colors, so poke 
around and see whether any of the predesigned themes match your fabled 
institution’s color palette. You can also tweak the colors for the background 
pages and individual design elements if you need to. Here’s how to modify 
the appearance of a college scheme site:
 
1. Log into your site and select Site Settings from the top of the Sites 
screen.
 
2. Click Appearance and choose the Themes tab, as shown in Figure 12-9.

193
 Chapter 12: Building a College Course Scheme
 
3. Pick a new theme. (Click the Preview button to see what your pages 
will look like with the new theme.)
 
4. Choose the Site Elements tab.
 
 The screen shown in Figure 12-10 lets you change Sidebar elements, 
add a logo or image to your header, and even change the layout of 
your pages.
 
5. To change a logo on the top of your site, click the Change Logo link in 
the Header section.
 
Figure 12-9:

overarching 
theme.
 
 
Figure 12-10:

194
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
 
6. Select the Custom Logo radio button, shown in Figure 12-11, and then 
browse to the image of your logo. Choose OK.
 
 (If you decide your logo isn’t exactly what you want, you can always 
repeat this process and go back to the Default Logo or select No Logo.)
 
7. Add a gadget to the Sidebar by clicking the Add a Sidebar Item link. 
Scroll down the list of gadgets from the Choose a New Page Element 
dialog box. When you find a gadget you like, click Add.
 
8. Click the Edit link on any newly added gadgets and enter any informa-
tion the gadget may require.
 
 In a Countdown gadget, for example, you need to enter an Event name 
and a termination date.
 
9. If you’ve created pages in your site that you want to access from the 
Sidebar navigation bar, click the Edit link in the Navigation gadget. In 
the Select Page to Add dialog box, select the page you want to appear 
in the Sidebar.
 
10. If you want to change the layout of your pages (by moving the Sidebar 
to the right or by making the header larger or smaller), click the 
Change site layout button and tweak the settings there.
 
11. To change the colors and fonts on your site, click the Colors and Fonts 
tab shown in Figure 12-12.
 
12. Select new colors for the various elements on your site by picking 
individual elements from the scroll-down list and then choosing a 
color from the color palette. (Don’t forget to save your changes.)
 
 If you need to get a more specific color, enter the hexadecimal code 
value in the box next to the color palette.

13. To change your title or setup options, click the Other Stuff tab.
 
 Change any settings that need changing from the original settings you 
picked in your first setup. (See Figure 12-13.)
 
Hexadecimal numbers (which are based on 16 digits) are used to represent 
over 16,000,000 colors that the human eye can see online. If you need to 
fine-tune your color choices, enter the hexadecimal code of the exact color 
you’re looking for in your Colors and Fonts screen. For example, do you need 
a light, pastel green? Try #99FF99. Check out www.colorschemer.com/

Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
Adding Web Page, File Cabinet, 
and List Page Elements
Google Sites gives you about a dozen different templates to start with. Not all 
of them will fit the site you’re trying to create. (See Chapter 4 for more 
detail.) In this section, we give you ideas on how to use the options displayed 
in Figure 12-14 in a college scheme. The three most common templates are
 
✓ Web Page: The most versatile template. You can do almost anything 
with it.
 
✓ File Cabinet: The perfect template for sharing files.
 
✓ List Page: An obscure template, useful for, well, lists.
To start any one of these templates, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Page button.
 
 The Create New Page form appears. (See Figure 12-14.)
 
2. Name the page in the Page Name textbox.
 
3. Select the radio button for your template.
 
4. Position the page, either at the “top level” or as a sub-page and 
subordinate to another page.
 
 For example, several subordinate pages can be found under the HIST 
1700 main page, such as a File Cabinet page and a List page.
 
5. Click Create Page.
Figure 12-14:
Select a 
template, 
name the 
page, and 
position it.
 

197
 Chapter 12: Building a College Course Scheme
Adding a gadget to a Web page
In this example, the Web page template — the most flexible template — was 
selected. We added graphics, gadgets, and an index to other course-related 
pages. Notice the sub-pages are listed automatically, making an index a bit 
redundant. Also, attachments (such as course-related files) and comments 
are designed into this flexible template.
To add a gadget, such as the RSS news feed shown in Figure 12-2, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Edit Page button.
 
2. Select the two-column setting by choosing Layout➪Two Columns.
 
3. Click the column where you want the gadget to appear.
 
4. Click the Insert button and choose More from the menu that appears.
 
5. Browse the Add a Gadget to Your Page’s topical index or use the 
search box to search for a gadget.
 
6. Click the link for the gadget you want and it’s added to your page, as 
shown in Figure 12-15.
 
Figure 12-15: 
Add a 
gadget.
 
Adding images
Adding images is a snap, regardless if they are from your local hard drive or a 
link to a page on the Web. Let’s touch on both. Here’s how to add images:

198
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
 
1. Open a Google Sites page and then click Edit Page.
 
2. Click the textbox where you want the picture to appear.
 
3. Choose Insert➪Image.
 
4. Now you can add an image. Images can come from either your 
computer or from the Web. Add the image as follows:
 
a. To upload a picture from your computer, select the Upload Images 
option and then click Choose File. After the file uploads, click the 
image and then click Add Image.
 
b. To link to an image on the Web, select the Web Address (URL) 
radio button and enter the URL of the image you need. You can 
easily open a separate browser window and navigate to an image, 
copy the URL from the address bar, and paste it into the Insert 
Image URL box back on your site.
 
5. Use the size and alignment options, shown in Figure 12-16, to adjust 
the image.
 
Figure 12-16: 
Size and 
align the 
image.
 
Adding a File Cabinet
A File Cabinet is an extremely useful tool, especially for college courses. Files 
need to be shared, and the File Cabinet has a lot to offer. Files of all types 
can be shared: Word, PowerPoint, Excel, JPG, and Google Apps can all be 
organized in the same File Cabinet. In this section, you see how Microsoft 
Office files from your hard drive are uploaded, as well as how Google Apps 
files, which reside online in the proverbial Internet cloud, can be shared.
Here’s how to implement a File Cabinet (refer to Figure 12-3) and to upload 
files of all kinds:
 
1. Click the Create New Page button. 
 
2. Select the File Cabinet radio button and then click the Create Page 
button. 

199
 Chapter 12: Building a College Course Scheme
 
3. On the page that appears, click Add File.
 
 The Add File dialog box appears. (See Figure 12-17.)
 
4. Now you can add the files. Files can come from either your own 
computer or from the Web. Add the files as follows:
 
a. To upload a file from your PC, select the Your Computer radio 
button and then browse to your file and click Upload.
 
b. To link to an online file, select The Web radio button and paste the 
URL or Web address in the box below. Enter a name for the linked 
file. Adding a discription is optional. Then click Upload.
 
Figure 12-17: 
Add a 
new file.
 
Adding a List page
List pages can help solve unique problems. In this example, a long, compli-
cated list of assignments is organized in a table format. When assignments 
are assigned, they are checked. Then when they are due, they are checked 
again. Details about each assignment are available 24/7 for students to 
look up.
To implement a List page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create New Page button and select the List radio button. 
(Refer to Figure 12-14.)
 
2. Choose Customize This List and define each column. In Figure 12-18, 
five categories are created.
 
3. Click the Add Item button.

usinesses, large and small, require flexibility for their intranets. In this 
chapter, we present some practical ideas for corporate intranets and 
small business users alike. Perhaps this will trigger some valuable ideas for 
your business unit. While we reveal various Google Sites options, we also 
suggest how to integrate some of the other Google Apps and Google gadgets 
into your Sites scheme. (For specific how-to steps, review Part I of this book.)
Unlike a personal or educational scheme, your business scheme revolves 
around making your business better. Enabling workgroups and allowing your 
employees or co-workers to share their collective knowledge helps you make 
better decisions and get new employees up to speed quickly. It’s no wonder 
that corporate wikis and blogs have become so popular in recent years. Add 
a splash of advertising and you’ve got an extra revenue stream besides. So 
get going and here’s to more profitable quarters ahead!
Google’s Advertising Tools
Google’s profitable advertising tools, AdWords and AdSense, pay for just 
about everything else that Google does. AdWords — the system that feeds 
ads to Google Search queries and affiliated advertisers — provides most of 
Google’s revenue. AdSense, also a moneymaker, allows Web sites to display 
AdWords ads at a profit. Then there is Google Analytics, which allows 
AdWords and AdSense users to track their ad traffic and the success of their 
advertising campaigns. When it comes to meeting the advertising needs of a 
business, Google’s online solutions are unparalleled. (See Figure 13-1.)

Google’s Other Business 
Tools for Intranets
Google has used its financial might to create new tools for internal business 
communications. The Google Apps program was created to bundle the 
communications software that businesses need to provide their employees. 
All the tools that can be offered to employees for free or at a nominal cost 
are as follows. (Each is explained in various chapters in this book.)
 
✓ Start Page
 
✓ Chat
 
✓ Web Pages
 
✓ Email
 
✓ Calendar

203
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
 
✓ Docs (Word processing, Spreadsheet, Presentations)
 
✓ Sites
Sites is just the latest tool added to the Google Apps solution suite. 
Businesses can make all of these tools available in a Sites-based intranet 
system. Figure 13-2 shows the Google Apps administrator’s Dashboard 
where all of these tools are managed.
Figure 13-2:

Apps

which is

Using All of the Sites Template Options
Every business has very unique intranet needs. What works for a software 
company is likely not the same for a widget manufacturer or a small 
bookstore. Even departments within a business can have different require-
ments. This makes a one-size-fits-all approach as impractical as it sounds. 
Fortunately, Sites has the flexibility to meet most of your business’s 
collaboration needs.
When creating your sites, consider what each of the five main template 
options can do for you.
 
✓ Web page: Great for most general intranet communcation needs
 
✓ Announcements: Perfect for, well, announcements

204
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
 
✓ File Cabinet: The best template for organizing, uploading, and down-
loading large numbers of files
 
✓ List page: Spot on for lists of things that neeed doing, such as a team 
project
 
✓ Dashboard: An effective way to organize gadgets for employees and 
team members
These options are discussed more fully in the next few sections.
The Web page template on an intranet
Figure 13-3 shows a Web Page template prepared as a starting point for 
employees at Ardsley Books. The page includes
 
✓ A calendar of events
 
✓ A link to the CEO’s monthly message
 
✓ Key announcements
 
✓ A link to corporate dashboard containing helpful gadgets
 
✓ A link to each major department’s intranet site within the company
Figure 13-3:
A Web page 
template in 
action.
 

205
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
The Web page is easily the most flexible of all the Sites template options. It 
can be used by various departments, teams of employees, or even individual 
employees. For example, the Web page template offers each individual 
employee in the company their own professional business page. In another 
example, the HR department may create a page to provide necessary 
information for new employees.
Teams can create Sites pages for each of their projects, as shown in Figure 
13-4. This project site has
 
✓ A secure team sign-in link
 
✓ A link to Google Talk, used for team communication
 
✓ A gadget that points to the team’s List page of To Do items
 
If you scroll to the bottom of a typical Sites Web page, there is also a place 
for team comments and a place to upload files in a designated attachment 
section. (See Figure 13-5.) The attachment section provides a quick way to 
handle limited file transfers. (For more demanding file sharing, a File Cabinet 
would be a better choice. Also, a separate Announcements page can be 
created for heavy traffic needs. Both templates are discussed next.)

The Announcements template 
on an intranet
Early in the life of a site, businesses can place announcements at the bottom 
of a Web page template, but when the traffic increases, creating a specialized 
Announcements page will be warranted. Creating such a page is as easy as 
choosing New➪Announcement. On the resulting page, announcements can 
be structured in chronological order. And one of the best features is the 
convenient Search tool.
The File Cabinet template on an intranet
The File Cabinet is one of the most important templates for teamwork and 
department sharing needs. Files of all types can be shared: PDF, Google Docs, 
Microsoft Office, images, and video.
 
When the number of files grows, they need to be organized by folders or 
labels. Creating folders is easy. Here’s all you need to do:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Move To➪New Folder.
 
2. Name the new folder.
 
3. Move related files into the folder by clicking the box next to the file’s 
name, and then clicking Move To followed by the name of the new 
folder.
Moving files from desktop PCs to a File Cabinet page is as easy as clicking 
Add File, browsing to the file, and clicking the Upload button. To add a file 
published on the Web, such as a Google Doc, spreadsheet, or presentation, 
follow these steps:

207
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
 
1. Open the file you need in Google Docs.
 
2. Publish the document by clicking the Publish tab and then clicking 
the Publising link.
 
3. Copy the URL or Web address of the file, as shown in Figure 13-6.
 
 Start by selecting the link first and then press the Ctrl+C keys to copy 
the link.
 
4. Return to the File Cabinet page where you want the document to 
appear.
 
5. Click Add File.
 
6. In the Add File box, select the The Web (Paste in URL) radio button.
 
7. Paste the URL in the URL box
 
 Press Ctrl+V to paste the link.
 
8. Type in the name of the file (or what you want to call the document.)
 
9. (Optional) Add a description for the file.
 
 This is helpful for both the users and for finding an obscure file with a 
search.
 
Figure 13-6:

Select and copy the link

208
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
 
When you have many files, the one you need can be lost easily. Use the Search 
tool to find the exact file you need. The search box is located in the upper-
right corner of each open Sites window. Enter a search word, which can 
include words in the file name or words in the document itself, and press the 
Search button. (Search also works on List, Announcements, Web site, and all 
other Sites pages.)
The List template on an intranet
The List template is the most obscure template. It is an ideal template for 
certain problems, like creating and tracking a list of team project steps or 
team activities. In the example shown in Figure 13-7, a rather detailed list of 
assignments due by team members can be created to track and check off 
upon completion.
 
One of the values of a List page is that the creators and collaborators can sub-
scribe to changes. When people complete activities, other team members who 
have subscribed to changes are informed about those changes. After each 
change, an e-mail update of changes is sent to subscribers.
 
Figure 13-7: 
A List 
template 
page.
 
The Dashboard template on an intranet
Dashboards allow the quick organization of gadgets. For instance, List or 
Announcements pages can be turned into gadgets. These gadgets can be 
placed on other pages that are more convenient to employees, such as on a 

209
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
start page or on a dashboard page. We explain how to do this with a List page 
in the next section. In fact, one has been placed on the dashboard page 
shown in Figure 13-8.
Many of these can be custom gadgets, coming straight from other intranet 
files or pages. For example, in Figure 13-8, you can see
 
✓ The Google Calendar gadget
 
✓ A Recent Announcements gadget
 
✓ A gadget listing recently uploaded files
 
✓ A gadget linking to a list or To Do page for teams
To add a list gadget to a dashboard (or any other page for that matter):
 
1. Click the Edit Page button.
 
2. Click Insert and select the Recent List Items option.
 
3. Pick the desired page from the Show List Items From drop-down list.
 
4. Modify any features you want, and then name the gadget in the 
Include Title box.
 
 The gadget then appears on the page you select, as shown in Figure 13-9.

Creating a Common Start 
Page for Lost Souls
It’s easy to get lost on corporate intranets. This is especially true for new 
employees. Create a portal, which we call a start page, to help them find their 
way around and get quickly up to speed. Start pages are readily available to 
all Google Apps users. A common corporate start page can direct novice 
users to all sorts of services, including high-value intranet Sites pages.
Analyzing a sample start page
Let’s explain what’s happening in the corporate start page shown in Figure 
13-10. A start page has three columns. The first column can be defined by 
the company and can’t be changed by the employee. The second and third 
columns can be filled with suggested gadgets, but individual employees can 
change them if they like. In our example, the first preset column has three 
necessary gadgets including: 
 
✓ A gadget linking directly to intranet Sites pages of common interest. 
(More on that later.)
 
✓ A gadget linking to e-mail, which also gives access to contacts and 
chat apps.
 
✓ A gadget receiving a popular business and financial RSS news feed.

211
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
Figure 13-10:
A start page 
in Google 
Apps can 
have a link 
to gadgets 
and intranet 
Sites pages.
 
The company can define default gadgets for the second and third columns as 
well. This helps new employees get the most from the start page right away. 
Albeit, the gadgets in the second and third columns can be customized by 
each employee to meet their needs over time.
New alternatives can be added by clicking the Google Add Stuff link. In brief, 
the following gadgets have been used on this default start page: 
 
✓ Link to Google Docs (word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation 
apps).
 
✓ General information news or RSS feeds.
 
✓ Link to corporate or team calendar.
 
✓ The local weather, (which can be customized to include the weather in 
each corporate office around the world).
 
✓ To Do list.
 
✓ Quote of the day.
 
✓ Fun site of the day.
Linking to Google Sites from a start page
 
The gadget linking the employee to the intranet Sites pages (refer to the 
upper-left corner of Figure 13-10) was created by the Sites intranet administra-
tor to give each employee one-click access to key intranet Sites pages.

212
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
To create a Sites navigation gadget, have the Google Apps administrator 
perform the following steps:
 
1. Click the Manage This Site link.
 
2. Click Service Settings and then click Customize in the Start Page 
section.
 
3. Click the Content tab in the Start Page Editor.
 
4. Click the Add Stuff link.
 
5. Click the Custom Sections link, if necessary, and then click the Create 
Custom Content link.
 
 The Update Custom Section dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-11.)
 
6. Select the Static Text, Images, and Links radio button.
 
7. Enter the names of the links that are being targeted on the intranet’s 
Sites pages in the box below the editing tools. Use the Link button to 
define the links.
 
 It may be easier for experienced HTML users to create this gadget by 
clicking the Edit HTML link and entering the desired links in a text 
editor. (See Figure 13-12.) Click the Update button when you finish.
 
8. Click the Update Section button after completing the data entry for 
your custom gadget.
 
9. Click the Ad It Now button under your newly created gadget.
 
 If necessary, click the Custom Sections link again in the Add Stuff 
window.

10. Return to the Start Page content editor and position the gadget in the 
Locked section of the start page.
View Your Sitemap and 
Link to Sub-Pages
The Web Page, File Cabinet, Dashboard, Announcements, and List Sites pages 
in this chapter can all fit into a broader site plan. This plan is automatically 
organized into a sitemap. A sitemap shows the relationship between pages 
on the site, as shown in Figure 13-13. Fortunately, Google Sites creates your 
sitemap for you automatically. Just click on Sitemap to see it. If a page is 
not in the correct position, you can just move it to where on the intranet that 
you want it.
To move a page around a site, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page you want to move.
 
2. Click More Actions.
 
3. Choose Move from the drop-down list.
 
4. Select the location from the Move Page window.
 
5. Click the Move button. (See Figure 13-14.)

Figure 13-14:

pages 
around an 
intranet site.
 
Although employees can get to any page by clicking the sitemap, it may 
not always be convenient. Instead, some pages can be linked from the 
department or team page. To create links to sub-pages, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a Sites page and click the Edit Page button.
 
2. In the Edit box, type in the words for the new link, select the words, 
and click the Link button.
 
 The Create Link dialog box appears. (See Figure 13-15.)

215
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
 
3. Pick the page from the list. 
 
 If the site is so large that you can’t see the page by clicking the My 
Changes and the Recent Site Activity links, enter the page name in the 
search window and click Search Pages.
 
4. Click OK.
 
Figure 13-15:

Setting Site Settings
 
Each intranet site needs a security plan. The Google Apps administrator needs 
to set up the security structure for the intranet site in accordance with com-
pany policy. Normally, in a business scheme, everything on the intranet is 
closed to the outside world. However, there may be a need to make some Sites 
pages public and open to other business partners. Administrators can control 
access in the Advanced Permissions settings. (For a more detailed example, 
read the discussion of site settings in Chapter 12.)
To set site settings for an intranet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Site Settings from the top of the Google Sites screen.
 
2. Click the Sharing tab.
 
3. Select the As Viewers radio button and enter the e-mail addresses of 
any supervisors and peers you want to invite to preview, view, and 
approve the site.

216
Part IV: Building Your Own Scheme 
 
4. In the Advanced Permissions section, select View from the Anyone at 
Domain Name May View/Edit This Site drop-down box.
 
5. Click the Invite These People button to send an e-mail message 
inviting colleagues and supervisors to view your Sites pages.
More technical settings
 
When a Google Apps administrator enables Google Sites, they can change 
security settings in the Service Settings section under the General tab. Here, 
sharing options can be optimized. Normal users will not see this screen. (See 
Figure 13-16.) The first setting in the Advanced Permission settings allows 
anyone within a company to either view or edit a site. Allowing just anyone 
inside the company intranet wouldn’t be prudent. However, flexibility needs 
to be given to teams and departments to edit their pages. Company leaders 
will need to come up with a policy involving who can make changes to certain 
pages and who can’t.

Matching your site’s appearance 
to your company brand
When you create your site, you want to customize the site to fit the corporate 
image and brand. You need to pinpoint your corporate color scheme and 
modify all the logos and branding messages. You can do this right out of the 

217
 Chapter 13: Building Business Schemes
box or you can modify them later by clicking the Manage Settings link from 
the Admin login page. For some ideas, review the college scheme ideas in 
Chapter 12.
 
For example, you can adjust the color scheme and change the Sidebar and 
Header elements by performing the following steps:
 
1. Log into your site and select the Site Settings from the top of the Sites 
screen.
 
2. Click Appearance and choose the Themes tab.
 
3. Pick a new theme.
 
 Click Preview to see what your pages will look like with the new theme.
 
4. Choose the Site Elements tab.
 
 This screen lets you change Sidebar elements, add a logo or image to 
your header, and even change the layout of your pages.
 
5. To change a logo on the top of your site, choose the Change Logo 
button in the Header section.
 
6. Select the Custom Logo radio button and then browse to the image of 
your logo. Click OK.
 
7. Add a gadget to the Sidebar by clicking the Add a Sidebar Item link.
 
8. Scroll down the list of gadgets in the Choose a New Page Element 
dialog box. When you find a gadget you like, click Add.
 
9. Edit the gadget’s settings as needed.

emember that your site is only as good as the info 
you share on it. Rather than create everything from 
scratch, use some of the other Google Apps to do your 
work for you. Because you’ll likely use Google Docs the 
most, we’ve got four chapters that help you begin sharing 
documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Then you 
find tips for Google Calendar, Gmail, and Google Talk.

Using Google Docs 
and the Docs Home
In This Chapter
▶ Previewing the advantages of Google Docs
▶ Getting started with Google Docs
▶ Putting the Docs Home to work organizing your files
▶ Publishing, converting, sharing, and collaborating with Google Docs
G
oogle Docs is the name of Google’s online productivity suite. The 
suite includes Google’s word-processing, spreadsheet, andmultimedia-
presentation apps. Powerful enough for most uses, the suite has one big 
advantage over popular desktop applications — you can use it for free. But 
we talk about many more advantages in this chapter, too.
Previewing Google Docs
Google Docs is a powerful online application suite that includes:
 
✓ Documents (or docs): An online word-processing software app, similar 
to Microsoft Word, Corel WordPerfect or StarOffice Writer. The 
Documents app is often called “Docs” for short. (Find out more in 
Chapter 15.)
 
✓ Spreadsheets: An online spreadsheet app, similar to Microsoft Excel, 
Quattro Pro, or Lotus 1-2-3. (Find out more in Chapter 16.)
 
✓ Presentations: A presentations app similar to Microsoft PowerPoint. 
(Find out more in Chapter 17.)
The Docs Home is the starting point for your docs. This is document central, 
a powerful management tool that keeps your files organized and at the ready. 
You can manage all your docs, spreadsheets, and presentations from a single 
Docs Home, as shown in Figure 14-1.

222
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Figure 14-1:
Docs are 
managed 
from the 
Docs Home.
 
Advantages of Docs
Using online apps has many advantages. First, you’re never bound to your 
PC. Google gives access to your docs anytime you need them from any 
computer in the world through any Internet connection. Second, Google Docs 
is platform independent, which means you can work on a PC or Mac with 
equal ease. Third, there’s no software to install because Google Docs works 
inside a Web browser. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari 
provide the support necessary to use Google Docs.
Here’s a list of six additional advantages that we detail in the pages that 
follow:
 
✓ Docs are easy to launch, easy to use, and secure your files in Google’s 
massive data centers.
 
✓ Innovative search and folder naming schemes in the Docs Home ensures 
that you’ll never misplace a doc, spreadsheet, or presentation again.
 
✓ A single-document approach (that is, singledocumindedness) empowers 
superb sharing, team collaboration, and revision control.
 
✓ Online publishing to Sites and blogs makes docs a key part of your 
communications strategy.
 
✓ Seamless conversion and support for other file types throws docs into 
the mainstream.
 
✓ The ability to work offline presents you with powerful new ways to work. 
See Chapter 10 for more information about using Docs offline.

223
 Chapter 14: Using Google Docs and the Docs Home
You can launch Docs Home in several ways:
 
✓ Enter a Web address: You can start your Google Docs directly from the 
Web by clicking the address bar and entering docs followed by your 
partnered domain name.
 
• Google Account users: Enter http://docs.google.com and log 
into your Google account.
 
• Team, Standard, Preferred, and Education Edition Users: Enter 
http://docs.google.com/a/yourdomain.com or http://
docs.yourdomain.com. For example, http://docs.google.
com/a/ardsleybooks.com or http://docs.ardsleybooks.
com. Log into your Docs account.
 
✓ Use a Start Page gadget: You can launch Docs conveniently from a 
gadget on your Start Page. To add a gadget, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Stuff link near the top left of the Start Page.
 
2. Click the Add It Now button below the Google Docs option, as 
shown in Figure 14-2. (While you’re here, you may as well add a 
gadget for your Gmail and Calendar apps!)
 
3. To return to your Start page, click the Back to Homepage link on 
the top left of the Add Stuff screen.
 
 After you add your gadget, click the Google Docs link at the top of the 
gadget. This takes you directly to the Docs Home screen. (See Figure 
14-3.) The gadget gives you one-click access to a half dozen of your 
most-recently opened files in a short list. There’s also a link to create 
new docs, which is activated in Figure 14-3. Look closely and you notice 
there’s even a search box. (We talk about document search later in this 
chapter.) If the document you need does not appear in the list, click the 
All Docs link and go directly to the Docs Home.
 
✓ Click the Documents link from other open Google Apps. Regardless 
of which Google App you’re using, if you peer at the upper-left corner, 
you can see a series of links. Click the Documents link to go straight 
to your Google Docs Home.

Your Docs account is protected by your login and password, just as they are 
on any other network. You can use the same login and password for all of 
your online Google Apps: Gmail, Sites, Calendar, Picasa, you name it. Click 
the Sign In link and input your secret password, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
Figure 14-4: 
Sign into 
your Google 
Apps, Sites,

If your computer crashes and your hard drive dies, your files are still safe 
online. As long as you have access to the Internet, you can access your 
files. You can even access your Google Docs from your smartphone browser 
as long as your phone account supports a higher-speed connection to the 
Internet.
 
If you can’t use your computer, you can use any other computer that happens 
to be lying around and log into your private Google account online. Even 
if you login to your account from someone else’s computer, you won’t sacri-
fice your security if you sign out properly at the end of your session. However, 
you should beware of one thing when using a computer other than your 
own; never click the Remember Me on This Computer check box (refer to 
Figure 14-4). Save this convenience for your personal computer.
 
Google is constantly making improvements to Docs. The software is con-
stantly being updated, but for the most part, you hardly notice. Because 
Google Docs is Web based, the most recent version of the software loads 
instantly. There’s nothing for you to install. In fact, Docs is in a constant state 
of improvement; therefore, some of the screenshots you see in this chapter 
may be slightly different from the versions you see on your screen.

225
 Chapter 14: Using Google Docs and the Docs Home
Using the Google Docs Home
The Docs Home is the hub where you can access all your files with ease. 
You can create new files; display, hide, sort, or delete files; import and 
export files; organize your files by folders or labels; and so on. The following 
sections describe how to do these tasks and more.
Creating, saving, naming, 
and renaming files
To create a new file, click the New button in your Docs Home andchoose 
either a word-processing document (doc), a spreadsheet, or a presentation 
from the drop-down list that appears. Wait a few seconds for the app to 
launch and you can start writing something deep and profound.
 
Google Docs wants you to save your files immediately so that nothing is lost. 
The saving and naming process is slightly different for each of the three apps, 
as follows:
 
✓ For a word-processing document (or doc): Whatever you type in the 
first line of your text becomes your default file name. Within a few 
seconds, the file is named or saved automatically. Choose File➪Save or 
click the Save button to save manually. (For more details, review 
Chapter 15.)
 
✓ For a spreadsheet: As soon as you enter data into your first cell, a box 
appears begging you to save the file immediately. Click the Start 
Autosaving link, enter a file name, click OK, and then go about your 
work. (For more details, review Chapter 16.)
 
✓ For a presentation: As soon as you enter a title into the title field of 
the first slide, the name is adopted as the file name. (For more details, 
review Chapter 17.) Save manually by clicking the Save button.
For more information on various saving options, review the individual 
chapters on each app.
After you save a file, the file name appears in the header at the top of the 
screen. If you’re not happy with the file name and need to make a change, 
you can return to your Docs Home, place a check mark next to the file name 
(as shown in Figure 14-5), and then click Rename on the Docs Home bar. 
(Other file renaming options are explained in Chapters 15, 16, and 17 for each 
individual app.)

Searching for files
If you’ve ever lost a file before, you’ll quickly appreciate Google’s famous 
search abilities found in Docs. The Docs Home deploys Google’s sophisti-
cated search tools to quickly find any file on any topic in your personal Docs 
library, no matter how many files or folders you’ve generated or how fuzzy 
your memory of where you placed the file.
Google makes searching your entire Docs Home ridiculously easy. Search for 
any file by entering part or all of the file name or by typing keywords based 
on the content of the file. Simply enter a few keywords in the textbox. Google 
Search tries to help you as much as it can. For example, in Figure 14-6, just 
entering a few digits in the Search box displays a list of files starting with 
those letters.
 
Figure 14-6: 
Enter 
keywords or 
phrases into 
the Search 
Docs 
textbox.
 
Simple searches, like the one explained above, help you find most files. 
However, if you discover that a file has somehow been interred in a sub-
terranean folder or hidden tomb, click the Show Search Options link next to 
the Search Docs button shown in Figure 14-6. This reveals the advanced 
search dialog box.
Fill in any and all information that you can remember about the file, as shown 
in Figure 14-7. For example, can you remember part of the file name? Can you 
remember the last time you made changes in the document? What type of file 
was it? Do you remember who originally owned the file? What about the 
names of other collaborators? Enter the e-mail addresses of these folks in the 
appropriate box.

After you make your most educated guesses, click the Search Docs button 
and see what appears. Chances are you’ll find your document.

Viewing, sorting, hiding, and trashing files
Files appear in the Docs Home list with the most recent files appearing at the 
top. If you want to sort the files in another way, click the appropriate option 
(Name, Folders/Sharing, Date) on the column heading above the file list 
(refer to Figure 14-1):
 
✓ Name: Click Name to sort the docs alphabetically (A–Z). Click Name 
again to reverse the order (Z–A).
 
✓ Folders /Sharing: You can sort alphabetically by folder names by 
clicking this column heading.
 
✓ Date: Click Date to sort from the oldest to the newest file. Click Date 
again to sort from the newest to the oldest file.
Uncovering the Docs Home organization pane
The organization pane on the left side of your Docs Home holds a long list of 
valuable display options. Perhaps the list is too long for your liking. To roll 
up the options, click the minus sign (–) to the left of each major heading: All 
Items, Saved Searches, All Folders, Items by Type, and Shared With (shown 
on the left in Figure 14-8). To roll them out again, click the plus sign (+) to the 
left of each heading to reveal the options (shown on the right in Figure 14-8).

Star struck
One of the most popular ways to sort files is with a star. (Yes, it’s a gold star.) 
To mark a file, click the star icon to the left of the file name, as shown in 
Figure 14-9.
You can star files for any reason. They may be important, you may need to 
give them urgent attention, or you may want to jog your memory that you 
need to work on a particular file. To display starred files, click the starred 
item in the docs organization pane. (See Figure 14-9.)

 Chapter 14: Using Google Docs and the Docs Home
Hide stuff
Docs allows users to hide files from view. You may want to hide old files so 
they don’t clutter your Docs Home.
To hide a file, place a check mark to the left of each file name and click 
the Hide button. Choose the Hidden item in the docs organization pane to 
display all the hidden files again.
Show only your stuff
If you actively share files with others, and they start sharing with you, file 
names proliferate throughout your Docs Home list. If you want to see only 
your stuff and exclude files created by others, click the aptly named Owned 
by Me item in the organization pane.
 
Click All Items in the Docs Home organization pane if you’ve displayed 
just your own files, starred files, or hidden files and now need to see your 
complete list.
Empty the trash, or not
If you need to delete a file, select the check box to the file’s left and then 
click the Delete button. Clicking this button sends the file to the Trash; but 
the file isn’t lost forever, it still exists. Click the trashcan icon in the docs 
organization pane, select the check box to the left of the file name, and delete 
it permanently by clicking Empty Trash. (You can also trash multiple files by 
selecting a group of them before clicking the Empty Trash button.)
 
If you’re trying to delete a shared document that you’ve created, you’re faced 
with a warning box that asks whether you want to trash the document for 
everyone. (Not a good idea.) If you still want to trash this document, click 
Assign a New Owner. Follow the steps and hand the document off to someone 
else. Then you can trash it in your Docs Home without problems.
If you change your mind and want to restore a file, go to the Trash, select the 
check box to the left of the file that you want to recover, and click the 
Undelete button.
 
You really don’t need to delete any items from the Trash — or, for that matter, 
to trash any files in the first place — because Google gives you plenty of space 
in which to save your files. However, if you find it helps to clear out a few files 
now and again, use the Hide feature. This places files out of sight but not out 
of mind and never trashed.

Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Uploading and converting 
your existing files
You can upload to Google Docs word-processing documents (docs), presen-
tations, and spreadsheets that you’ve created with many different programs. 
Uploaded files show in your Docs Home where you can keep them safe, 
sound, and ready for editing.
Follow these steps to upload a file to the Docs Home:
 
1. Sign into the Docs Home.
 
 Refer to the earlier “Easy to launch, easy to use, and very secure” section.
 
2. Click the Upload button.
 
 The Upload a File screen appears.
 
 You can upload the following file types (see the left side of the Upload a 
File screen):
 
• Text and word-processing files: .doc, .docx, .rtf, .txt, .sxw, 
.htm, .html
 
• Presentations: .ppt, .pptx, .pps
 
• Spreadsheets: .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .ods
 
• PDF: .pdf files can now be uploaded and managed in the Docs 
Home
 
3. Click the Browse button; in the Choose File dialog box that appears, 
select the file that you want to upload to Google Docs and then click 
the Open button.
 
 Alternatively, you can enter the file path to the file (if you know it) in 
the Browse Your Computer to Select a File to Upload textbox. You can 
also enter a Web address in the Or Enter the URL of a File on the Web 
textbox.
 
4. (Optional) Enter a new name for the file in the What Do You Want to 
Call It textbox.
 
 If you don’t name the file, it retains its current file name.
 
5. Click the Upload File button.
 
 The file that you upload converts, saves, and opens as a Google file.
 
6. If you make any changes to your file, click the Save & Close button; 
otherwise, click the Docs Home link to return to the Docs Home.

231
 Chapter 14: Using Google Docs and the Docs Home
 
An alternative way to upload a file to your Docs Home is to e-mail it directly 
to your Google Docs. When you click the Upload button, your assigned e-mail 
address appears at the bottom of the open window. You may need to scroll 
down a bit to see it. Copy this e-mail address and use it to e-mail documents 
directly to your Docs Home.
 
Instead of using the upload feature, you can also copy and paste from an 
existing file to a new Google file. If you want to remove all the formatting from 
an existing file first, copy and paste the text into Notepad or another text 
editor, and then copy and paste the text into a Google Doc, spreadsheet, or 
presentation.
Singledocumindedness for Sharing, 
Collaboration, and Revision Tracking
Okay, we made up the word singledocumindedness, but we couldn’t think 
of a real word that seemed to fit. The point is, you don’t need to keep 
multiple versions of any file ever again — not for yourself, not for your 
collaborators, not for anyone else in the world with whom you want to share 
a Doc, spreadsheet, or presentation. Google’s new single-file approach 
enhances collaboration, sharing, and revision control.
Revision History tracks changes 
by you and your collaborators
You need only one copy of each file, regardless of the number of collabora-
tors because Docs catalogs and maintains changes within a single master file. 
The Revision History feature allows you to peek back in time to see what 
changes have been made at any point during the creation of that file — from 
start to finish. You can always revert to a time before certain changes were 
made to your file. You can also determine who among your contributors 
made specific changes because the names of the collaborators are recorded 
along with their changes. (See Figure 14-10.)
Launch the Revision History feature in a doc by choosing File➪Revision 
History. In the Spreadsheet and Presentation apps, click the Revision tab.
To go back to a prior revision, choose the hours, days, weeks, or months ago 
that you made a change. If you don’t instantly land on the revision you need, 
click forward or backward until you find the version you’re looking for.

approach.
 
Organizing your files by folders or labels
Folders provide a way to organize your files by categories. In thesingle-file 
approach, you don’t physically move or copy a file into a new folder; rather, 
you attach a folder name or a label to the file itself.
You can label a file so that it appears in any number of folders without gener-
ating digital replicas. Instead, you can attach any number of folder names to a 
file. Each file appears with its folder label in the Docs Home. This way, the file 
appears like magic in any folder you pick.
This approach works like the files on an iPod or other digital media player. 
For example, the love song “Michelle,” by the Beatles, has multiple labels, 
such as Beatles, 1960s, Love Songs, M, and My Playlist. Looking for any one of 
these different labels, you can quickly find and play the singular copy of the 
file you have on your iPod. (Singledocumindedness in action yet again.)
To create new folders and assign files to that folder, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose New➪Folder.
 
2. Name the folder and choose a color or other options if you want. 
 
3. Select the check box to the left of any files that you want to label with 
your selected folder name.
 
4. Click the Move To drop-down list. In the menu that appears, choose 
the folder name. Then click the Move To Folder button. (Click Cancel 
if you change your mind.)

233
 Chapter 14: Using Google Docs and the Docs Home
 
5. To display only the files assigned to a folder, click the folder name in 
the organization pane.
 
6. You may need to expand the All Folders item to see all of your fold-
ers. Click All Items in the organization pane and look under the 
Folders/Sharing column heading to see the folder(s) assigned to a file.
 
With Google protecting your files, do you need to make backups anymore? 
Yes, of course. But backing up isn’t the headache it used to be. When you save 
your Google files online in a Google data center, Google says that it creates 
backups just about as fast as you make changes to your file. However, it’s still 
just a bunch of computers out there, so back up critical files on your hard 
drive at a minimum; you know, all the legal stuff or that report you can’t do 
without, but don’t lose any sleep over the rest of your files.
 
A quick way to create a backup copy of a file is to e-mail a copy of the con-
verted file to yourself. More details are also provided for each individual 
application in Chapters 15, 16, and 17. 
Sharing and collaborating
One of the pioneering features in Google Docs is the ability for people from 
anywhere in the world to work simultaneously on a file with very little fuss 
and bother. The only things required for collaborating is an e-mail address, 
an online connection, and the courage to know that everyone can be writing 
at the same time on the same file without the fear of losing anything or 
messing each other up.
 
Google Docs keeps track of the changes and shares the updated document 
every few seconds with everyone on the collaborating team — a good example 
of singledocumindedness in action. Your team is not working on separate files 
that you reconcile later, but on the exact same file at exactly the same time. 
So, don’t worry if someone messes things up by adding something silly or 
deleting your perfect prose. You can always revert back to a previous version 
that Google saved several minutes, hours, days, or even months ago. (See 
the earlier “Revision Histories tracks changes by you and your collaborators” 
section.)
At the bottom of the screen, you see exactly who is actively collaborating at 
any one time. Changes made by others are tracked not just by name but by 
color as well, so you can quickly see who has been adding, what they added, 
and where they added the information. (See Figure 14-11.)

View your active collaborators
About inviting collaborators
You will need to make a few decisions about your collaborators. First, you 
need to decide whether you want to invite people as collaborators — 
allowing them to make changes — or as viewers only. Viewers can only read 
the file itself but are not given the permission to make changes.
In Figure 14-12, we invited several collaborators. Inviting collaborators and 
viewers is as easy as entering in their e-mail addresses. This feature makes 
use of your contact list, so it’s as easy to invite collaborators as it is to enter 
e-mail addresses into Gmail.
 
For the secretive among us, you may want to use some advanced permission 
features. For example, you can give or deny your collaborators the right to 
invite other collaborators or viewers. You can also allow or disallow the right 
for collaborators to broadcast the page to mailing lists. Generally, these first 
two options are both selected; however, if you want to keep everything 
private, simply remove the check mark from these two options. There’s also 
a setting to only allow someone from within a company or organization to 
view a file online by requiring a login. 
To start sharing with others, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share button’s drop-down arrow and choose Share with 
Others if necessary.
 
2. Choose one of the following options shown in Figure 14-12:
 
• Select the As Collaborators radio button to allow the people that 
you invite to make changes to the document.
 
• Select the As Viewers radio button to restrict the people you invite 
so that they can read the doc but make no changes.

235
 Chapter 14: Using Google Docs and the Docs Home
 
Figure 14-12:

3. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people with whom you want to share 
the document in the textbox in the Invite People section.
 
4. (Optional) Select any or all of the check boxes in the Advanced 
Permissions section.
  
• Collaborators May Invite Others: Give or deny your collaborators 
the right to invite other collaborators or viewers by selecting 
(to grant) or deselecting (to deny) the check box.
 
• Invitations May Be Used by Anyone: Allow or disallow collaborators 
the right to broadcast the page to mailing lists by selecting (to 
allow) or deselecting (to disallow) this check box. 
 
• Anyone from <your domain> May <selection> This Document at: 
Allow only users from within a company or organization to view 
the document by requiring them to log in.
 
5. Click the Invite Collaborators button.
 
 An invitation screen appears. (See Figure 14-13.) Treat this screen 
exactly like an e-mail message. Your collaborators and viewers automati-
cally appear in the To box. You also have the option to paste a copy of 
the document to the e-mail message after it has been sent.
 
6. Click the Subject textbox and type a subject, and then click the 
Message textbox and type a message to your collaborators.
 
7. (Optional) If you want to paste a copy of the document into the e-mail 
message, do so by selecting the Paste the Document Itself into the 
Email Message check box.
 
8. Click the Send button to send the invitation.

Multiple collaborators can enter data or change formatting on the same doc at 
the same time. Shared docs are saved every time you blink (or so it seems) to 
protect the changes collaborators are making. And don’t worry if someone 
makes a mistake. All the changes are tracked to maintain quality control. You 
can always revert back to a previous reversion. To find out how, read more 
about Revision History in Chapter 15.
Editing your collaborators list
Click the Share button and choose Share With Others from the list that 
appears. You see a list of your collaborators and viewers in the right-hand 
pane of the Sharing window. (See Figure 14-14.) If you need to send additional 
e-mail messages or updates of your document to a team, you can do that 
from the Email Collaborators link. If you need to add or delete collaborators, 
you can do that from this panel also.
 
The documents you share are listed in the Docs Home page for all of your 
collaborators to open, see, and edit. Collaborators can then organize the 
documents in any way that suits them — by assigning labels or folders — just 
like they would for documents of their own creation. (See Chapter 11.) The 
list of all those collaborating on the document will also be available to them.
By getting the sharing and collaboration feature to work efficiently, Google 
Docs makes working in teams nearly hassle free. For app-specific details 
about sharing Docs, spreadsheets, and presentations, review the “Sharing 
and Collaboration” sections for each individual app in Chapters 15, 16, 
and 17.

Converting and exporting docs 
into other file formats
Google Docs may not give you all the options and settings that a high-end 
word-processing, desktop-publishing, spreadsheet, or presentation program 
can. You may need to download and convert a lot of files (a lot of work on 
your part) into a file format that a high-end application can handle.
You can make these conversions directly from the Docs Home. Start by 
clicking the box next to the file you want to convert and then click the More 
Actions drop-down list. From the menu that appears, choose the file format 
that you need.
A dialog box appears, asking whether you want to open or save the file. Click 
the Save button. In the Save As dialog box that appears, browse to where you 
want to save the file and click the Save button.
Changing your language settings
Many users will need to change the language settings for Google Docs. 
Change the language settings by clicking the Settings link in the header and 
making the necessary changes in the Settings window. For example, select a 
different language from the Language drop-down list. Click the Save button at 
the bottom of the screen to save your changes.

238
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
To change settings back to their original defaults, click the Settings link again. 
If you set the language to something other than English, you need to know 
the words for the options in that language. For example, Settings in Spanish is 
Configuración.
 
Google Docs is available to you anytime from any online computer anywhere 
in the world. And, if you’re away from an Internet hotspot and need to work 
offline on a doc, Google Gears allows you to do just that by accessing the 
Offline link in the header. See Chapter 10 to find out more.
A dialog box appears that guides you through the process. There is a warning 
that you assume the responsibility for your own security after the files leave 
the friendly confines of Google’s data centers. That being said, it’s nice to 
have your documents safe on your PC for those times no Internet connection 
is handy. To make this happen, click the Enable Offline Access button and 
continue following the directions on the screen. If you need more help, click 
the Offline Help link.
 
You will be asked if you want to add a Shortcut to your desktop. That’s 
probably a good idea so you can launch your documents without having to 
hunt around too hard for them.
Using Help and signing out of Google Docs
If you don’t understand something (we can’t describe every obscure detail in 
this book), click the Help link in the header to find out more.
When you’re done for the day, click the Sign Out link and take the rest of the 
day off.
 
You’re probably wondering, “Do I really need to sign out?” Not really, but it’s 
still a good idea. Just closing your browser may close your file before the auto-
matic backup has kicked in. You may lose some last-second changes to a file if 
you don’t click the Save & Close button or sign out first. Even if you do exit 
quickly without signing out, though, you shouldn’t lose much work because 
Google makes frequent automatic saves for you.

T
he word-processing part of Google Docs, Documents, is often called 
Docs for short. Docs is exceedingly easy to use; experienced Word, 
WordPerfect, or OpenOffice.org Writer users will pick it up faster than it 
takes to do a Google search. And if someone has never used a word proces-
sor before, Docs is doubtless the most user-friendly word-processing app a 
beginner can have at her fingertips.
 
This chapter starts with the basics and moves with dispatch to the advanced 
features in Google Docs. We flag the beginner stuff with the word simply in the 
headings. We signal the power-user stuff with the words power or powerful to 
make it clear when you’re stepping into the deep end of the word-processing 
pond.
Starting Simply with Google Docs
When you’re ready to start writing, log into your Docs Home. There are two 
basic ways of logging in:

240
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ Google Account users: Visit http://docs.google.com and log into 
your Docs account.
 
✓ Team, Standard, Preferred, and Education Edition Users: Visit 
http://docs.google.com/a/yourdomain.com and log into your 
Docs account.
Create a new document from the Google Docs Home by clicking the New 
button and picking Document. (Review Chapter 14 to find out about the Docs 
Home.)
Exploring the basic tools
Quickly — on to the basics of how to use Google Docs. The few-frills 
Google Docs workspace appears inside your Web browser and is divided 
into four main parts: header, menu bar, toolbar, and input area, as shown in 
Figure 15-1.

 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
Clearly, you enter your text into the Docs input area. Then you can apply 
formatting, such as italics, bold, bulleted or numbered lists, styles, and so on. 
After, saving and printing become necessary. All of these operations can be 
done by using the various elements of the workspace, as follows:
 
✓ Docs Header: The upper section of the Docs interface. It includes the 
name of your document, your login name, and a link back to your Docs 
Home. This header allows for sharing and superfast saving and closing. 
(Refer to Figure 15-1.)
 
✓ Docs Menu Bar: A traditional-looking menu bar. The menu bar’s pull-
down menus give you complete control of your word processor. When 
you need more depth and a few extra options, click one of the familiar 
menu names: File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Table, Tools, and Help.
 
✓ Docs Toolbar Buttons: A traditional-looking toolbar. This toolbar gives 
you one-click access to the most frequently used word-processing com-
mands and formatting features (highlighted in Table 15-1). Click the 
appropriate button on the Docs Toolbar when you’re ready to save, 
print, or format.
 
✓ Input Area: A traditional blank space where you can enter your text, 
pictures, tables, and more.
 
✓ Keyboard Shortcuts: Fully supported keyboard commands. Addicted 
to your keyboard? Use the keyboard shortcuts. For example, press 
Ctrl+B for Bold and Ctrl+S for Save. Commonly used shortcuts appear 
in Table 15-1.
Watching the toolbar buttons
Take a look at the one-click toolbar buttons in Figure 15-2. Active buttons 
are highlighted. They appear with a thin blue line around them and are 
slightly darker. Just by looking at the toolbar in Figure 15-2, you can tell that 
a Verdana 10 point (10pt) font is being used. The text has been bolded and 
aligned to the left margin. Most people miss these details, which saddens the 
developers that spent ages adding these subtle complexities to the toolbar.

The buttons on the toolbar are so traditional that you can probably guess 
what each one does just by looking at it. But if you need a quick review, Table

for each of the Docs Toolbar buttons.

Google Docs is in a constant state of improvement. In Google-speak, it’s a per-
petual beta. You may notice slight differences between your version of Docs 
and a few of the screen images in this chapter. Don’t panic. The basics don’t 
change much and the improvements are usually well worth it.
Simply Saving, Renaming, 
and Printing Google Docs
 
 The first two buttons on the toolbar are the Save and Print buttons, and we 
start there. As with most things in Google Docs, there are many ways to 
accomplish important tasks. For instance, you can save a document five 
different ways:
 
✓ Click the Save button on the Docs Toolbar.
 
✓ Click the Save button in the header.
 
✓ Click the Save and Close button on the header to both save and close 
the document in one convenient click.
 
✓ Choose the File menu and choose Save.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+S.
We know this is overkill, but it does make it user friendly! In another example 
of how easy Docs is to use, you can print several ways:
 
✓ Click the Print button on the Docs Toolbar.
 
✓ Choose the File menu and choose Print.

Google Docs is almost too eager to save your documents. Well-intentioned 
enough, Docs doesn’t want you to lose anything, so it starts saving almost 
immediately. Docs doesn’t save just a backup copy in case of a computer 
crash; it saves the actual document from any possible harm or eventuality. 
Documents are named automatically, based on whatever you enter in the 
first line of your text. Because of this, if you don’t enter any text for a while, 
you may get stuck with “Untitled” as the document’s name. This will never 
do. To rename a document:
 
1. Choose File➪Rename or click the file’s name in the header.
 
2. If your browser gives you a prompt to allow scripts, follow the on-
screen instructions and do so. Then choose File➪Rename or click the 
temporary name in the Docs Header again.
 
3. Enter the new name in the dialog box.

Simply Editing and Viewing Documents
Editing is the process of cleaning up a document. It includes proofreading, 
spell checking, and fixing mistakes. We start simply and put the power details 
off until later in the chapter.
Checking your spelling
 
 Unless you were a finalist for the Scripps National Spelling Bee in your youth, 
face it, everyone is guilty of misspelling. To check spelling in your document, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Check Spelling button on the Docs Toolbar or choose 
Tools➪Check Spelling from the menu bar.
 
 Words that are potentially misspelled are highlighted.
 
2. When you spot a misspelling, click the highlighted word and a list of 
alternatives appears.
 
3. Click the correct alternative from the list and the word will be 
corrected.
 
Docs highlights all the words it thinks are misspelled. This includes words, 
names, or acronyms that are spelled correctly but aren’t included in the Docs 
dictionary, such as a capitalized Vista or the acronyms XP and OS X. You can 
ignore these correctly spelled terms, but a better option may be to add unique 
words, names, and acronyms to the Docs dictionary by selecting each anomaly 
and clicking the Add to Dictionary button.
When you finish spell checking your document, just click on the Spell Check 
button again and spell checking discontinues.
Basic editing commands on the Edit menu
The Undo and Redo options are found on the Edit menu, along with some 
other important features like Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All. The Select All 
command selects all the text in your Google Doc. Also, note that the key-
board shortcuts are listed under the Edit menu. If you forget a keystroke 
command, you can quickly look it up by choosing the Edit menu.

246
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Undoing mistakes
 
 When you make a mistake, you can restore your document to how it was 
before your mistake by clicking the Undo button on the Docs Toolbar or by 
choosing Edit➪Undo. However, if you undo something unintentionally or if 
the Undo command creates more problems than it solves, you can reverse 
the operation by clicking the Redo button on the Docs Toolbar or by choos-
ing Edit➪Redo. (And don’t forget the keystroke commands: Ctrl+Z for Undo 
and Ctrl+Y for Redo.)
Cutting, copying, and pasting
When you need to move or copy text, images, and tables, use the cut, copy, 
and paste functions. Make your selection and then choose Edit➪Cut or 
Edit➪Copy, followed by Edit➪Paste to complete the action. You can also 
press the equivalent keyboard shortcut keys:
 
✓ Ctrl+X = Cut
 
✓ Ctrl+C = Copy
 
✓ Ctrl+V = Paste
 
With some operating systems, when you cut, copy, and paste, you need to 
permit access to the system Clipboard, which is a holding place in memory for 
cut and copied text and graphics, until you’re ready to paste them. If a dialog 
box asking about access to the Clipboard appears, just click the button that 
allows access and paste away.
Finding and replacing words or phrases
At times, you may need to search and replace a specific word or phrase as 
you edit a doc. Do so by choosing Edit➪Find and Replace or by pressing 
Ctrl+H. Enter the word or phrase you’re looking for and its replacement. 
Press Enter or click the Replace/Find button to complete the action.
Viewing options
When you’re working with Google Docs, you’re working online — on an 
actual Web page. The default Normal (plain) view (available on the View 
menu) is used so you can see how the document will likely look online. Plus, 
the Normal view has the advantage of using all the available space on your 
screen to view your text while you edit it.

247
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
If you want to view how the pages will look when printed, click View➪Fixed-
Width Page View. Compare how this document view looks in Figure 15-3 
with the Web page view shown in Figure 15-1. (Note: We refer back to Figure

Simply Formatting Documents
Most of the buttons on the Docs Toolbar are used for formatting. Formatting 
makes documents more interesting visually and easier to read. You can apply 
formatting options two ways:
 
✓ Select any text you want to format and then click the desired toolbar 
button.
 
✓ Click a formatting button first to turn on the feature, enter your text, and 
then click the formatting button again to turn the option off.

248
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Changing font size, style, text color, 
and highlight color
A new Google Doc starts out with a Verdana 10-point font as its default. 
Verdana is an easy-to-read font. The point size refers to how big or small a 
font appears on screen and in print. The higher the number, the larger the 
font. A 10-point (10pt) font is large enough for most readers.
If you don’t like the default font, you can change it by clicking the Font drop-
down list (click the little triangle) and choosing a different font — such as 
Georgia, Garamond, Tahoma, or Narrow. Similarly, to change the font’s point 
size, click the Size drop-down list and choose a different point size, such as 
12 or 14.
The same procedure applies for changing the color of your text or placing 
a highlight color around your words. To change the color of text, click the 
Text Color button and select a color from the color palette that appears. To 
add a highlight color around your words, click the Highlight Color button and 
choose the color you want from the palette. Be sure the highlight color con-
trasts with the color of your text so that it can be easily read.
Bold, italic, and underline
 
 
There’s nothing more basic than applying bold, italic, and underline 
formatting to your words. These three formats predate word processing. 
They are as follows:
 
✓ Bold: Has its origins in the very old typewriter ribbon days when impor-
tant text was literally typed over two or three times to make the words 
appear bolder so they would stand out from the rest of the text.
 
✓ Italic: Subtly slants a font onto its side to offset it from other text. Electric 
typewriters with removable typing balls made this formatting style very 
popular in the 1970s.
 
✓ Underline: Another holdover from the typewriter days when important 
text, like side-headings and titles, were underlined by carefully spac-
ing back over words and pressing the Shift+_ keys repeatedly until 
the words were underlined. Today, underlining words is discouraged 
because they appear to be hypertext links that people instinctively click 
to no avail.

249
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
Removing pesky formats
 
 Disappointed with some of your formatting choices? Remove them easily by 
choosing your text and clicking the Remove Formatting button. This removes 
bold, italic, and underline formats from text in one click. This is such an 
important command that you can implement it by either clicking the button 
from the Docs Toolbar or choosing Format➪Clear Formatting.
Numbered and bulleted lists
 
 Numbered and bulleted list buttons work as advertised. A sample of both a 
numbered and a bulleted list appear in Figure 15-3. To begin a list, click either 
the Numbered or Bulleted list button, enter the first list item, and then press 
Enter. Each time you press the Enter key, a new bullet or the next number 
appears. You can also create the entire list first, select the list, and tap the 
appropriate button after the fact. Bulleted lists, like this one:
 
✓ Display information in no particular order or sequence.
 
✓ Provide an easy way to organize similar types of information.
 
✓ Make complicated lists of information easier to read and take in.
Numbered lists imply a sequence of events. You can start this kind of list by 
following these steps:
 
1. Press the Numbered List button.
 
2. Enter your text.
 
3. Press Enter at the end of each paragraph.
 
To turn bulleting or numbering off, click the appropriate button again. You 
may need to press Enter after your list ends and also tap the Decrease Indent 
button a few times to realign your text to the left margin as explained below.
Understanding default margins
To understand alignment, you must first know about margins. The margin 
defines the unprinted space around the edge of the document. The defaults 
in Google Docs are set at 1 inch of unprinted space around the top, sides, and 
bottom of a Google Doc. (We explain how to change the margins in the “Power 
Converting, Saving, and Adjusting Doc Options” section of this chapter.)

250
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Decrease or increase indentions
 
 The Increase Indent button moves a selected paragraph 
1⁄2 inch to the right of 
the current margin. This is often used for long quotes in reports. The 
Decrease Indent button does just the opposite by moving an entire paragraph 
1⁄2 inch to the left. This button is often needed to correct paragraphs that may 
slip out of alignment. For example, if the bullets or numbers are removed 
from a list, oftentimes the paragraphs remain indented improperly. Simply 
select the misaligned paragraphs and then click the Decrease Indent button.
Aligning to the left, right, 
and center of a doc
 
 The Docs Toolbar offers three one-click alignment possibilities:
 
✓ Left Align: By default, documents are aligned to the left margin. This 
means that the text appears straight on the left margin yet is ragged on 
the right-hand side, as a quick glance at the toolbar icons reveals. To 
move centered, right-aligned, or justified text back to the default left 
margin, reselect the text and click the Left Align button.
 
✓ Center Align: To center a title or an image, select your text or image and 
click the Center Align button. You can also click the Center Align button 
first and then enter your text.
 
✓ Right Align: Align your text straight on the right margin by clicking the 
Right Align button. This option is rarely used because it’s often hard to 
read text that is ragged on the left side of a document.
 
The Format menu provides alternative ways of selecting the left-, right- and 
center-align commands. You can also align text straight on both margins by 
using the Justify command; choose Format➪Align➪Justified.
Power Formatting with Styles, 
Superscripts, Subscripts, and More
The most powerful commands on the Format menu are the styles found in its 
upper section. Styles allow you to apply consistent and professional-looking 
formats throughout the doc. To see examples of the H1, H3, and Normal 
styles, refer to Figure 15-3.

251
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
The following styles can be applied by selecting the target text and picking 
one of these options from the Format menu:
 
✓ Normal Paragraph Text: Apply the Normal paragraph style to remove 
other styles, such as H3 and H1.
 
✓ Minor Heading (H3): Apply the H3 heading, the smallest heading style. 
(Refer to Figure 15-3.)
 
✓ Sub-Heading (H2): Apply a larger heading style for sub-headings and 
section titles.
 
✓ Heading (H1): Apply the largest heading style for the most dominant 
titles. (Refer to Figure 15-3.)
In the lower section of the Format menu are some important, yet specialized, 
formatting commands:
 
✓ Strikeout: Draw a line through (or strike out) words.
 
✓ Superscript: Raise text above the line for footnote references and 
exponents such as 23=8.
 
✓ Subscript: Apply this style to lower the text below the line such as 
in H2O.
 
✓ Block Quote: Indent text on both the left and right margins by 
1⁄2 inch 
like those used in long quotes in a report.

Powerfully Inserting Elements
Many characterize Google Docs as an anemic product when compared to 
traditional desktop word processors, but as you see in this section, the gap 
has narrowed. Docs has enough bells and whistles to be a highly proficient 
tool for your word-processing needs. Most users will never need more word-
processing features than those found in Docs. To see what we mean, click 
the Insert menu and look at the important options. This menu allows you to 
insert a host of elements: pictures, links, comments, tables, bookmarks, sepa-
rators, and special characters.
Before we jump into this detailed list, it may be good to preview what some 
of these features actually do. Take a look at Figure 15-4. (We refer back to this 
figure a half-dozen times in the next few pages.)

Adding images couldn’t be easier. Just remember that you must upload 
images before you can insert and view them, as explained in these steps:
 
1. Position your insertion point where you want the image to appear in 
the document.
 
2. Choose the Insert menu and then select the Picture option.

3. Select either the From This Computer radio button or the From the 
Web (URL) radio button, as shown in Figure 15-5. Depending on which 
radio button you select, the steps change a bit.
 
a. If you select the From This Computer radio button, click the 
Browse button. In the File Upload dialog box that appears, browse 
to your file, select it, and click the Open button, which places the 
path to the file in the Browse box. In the Insert Image dialog box, 
click the Insert Image button.
 
b. If you select the From the Web (URL) radio button, type or paste 
the URL into the Enter Image Web Address textbox. A preview of 
the image appears in the dialog box. Click the Insert Image button.

 This reveals the optional features of the Insert Image dialog box shown 
in Figure 15-5 including:
 
• Size: Change the size of your image in the size drop-down menu.
 
• Position: Align your image to the left, right, or center of the text 
adjacent to the image.
 
• Wrap Text around Image: Allows the text to appear around or 
alongside the text, as shown in Figure 15-4. If you don’t check this 
option, the text is pushed underneath the image.
 
5. Click the Insert button to insert the image into your document or 
choose Cancel to abandon the process.

Making links
One of the great strengths of Google Docs is its ability to link to other pages, 
such as to your Google Sites. (See the link samples in Figure 15-4.) To create 
a link (or hyperlink) in your Doc, select the text you want to turn into a link 
and click the Link button on the Docs Toolbar (or choose Insert➪Link). The 
Change Link window appears, as shown in Figure 15-6.
 
Figure 15-6: 
Link to a 
Web page, 
e-mail 
application, 
bookmark, 
or another 
document.
 
Select the radio button that matches the resource to which you are linking. 
As you select a radio button, the textbox changes slightly so you can specify 
the correct type of linked data. Choose from the following options:
 
✓ URL: Links to a Web page. Enter the URL in the textbox that appears. In 
Figure 15-6, the Web address (URL) www.google.com has been entered. 
(Google Docs automatically adds the http:// for you.)
 
✓ Document: Links to another document that you’ve created in Docs. 
Choose the document from the drop-down list that appears.
 
✓ Bookmark: Links to a bookmark that you’ve made inside your docu-
ment. (See the next section, “Sticking a bookmark in your document,” for 
the steps required to create a bookmark.) Choose the bookmark from 
the drop-down list that appears.
 
✓ E-Mail Address: Creates a link that opens an e-mail application and 
pastes the target address in the To box.
 
✓ Text: Changes the text of your hyperlink in the Link Display section. This 
also changes the link text in your document.

256
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ Flyover: Displays a word or phrase that you want to pop up when some-
one hovers their mouse over the link.
 
✓ Open Link in New Window: Forces the link to open your destination page 
in a new browser window, which means your original document doesn’t 
vanish from a reader’s computer screen every time she clicks on your link.
 
If you need to change any of the settings above, right-click on the link and 
choose Change Link from the contextual menu that appears. Remove the link 
entirely by right-clicking and choosing Remove Link.
Sticking a bookmark in your document
Bookmarks allow you to create links from one part of a document to another. 
You may find bookmarks useful in long documents so you can avoid paging 
down endlessly to find the passage that you’re looking for.
To create a bookmark, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the location where you want the bookmark to go.
 
 This is the destination point — where someone lands after clicking your 
bookmark.
 
2. Click the Insert menu and choose the Bookmark command.
 
 The Insert Bookmark dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the New Bookmark textbox, type a name for your bookmark, 
and then click the Insert button.
 
After you create your bookmark, you’re only half done. The second half of the 
process requires you to create a link to your bookmark that readers can click to 
go to the bookmark’s location. For example, you can create a table of contents at 
the top of a document that links to bookmarks to each section within the docu-
ment. We describe how to create a link in the earlier “Making links” section.
 
If you need to edit or manage your bookmarks, choose Tools➪Manage 
Bookmarks. You can delete or add bookmarks as needed from the dialog box 
that appears.
Inserting comments
Comments are a valuable tool for tracking edits or for discussing issues about 
a document with team members. They appear in multicolored boxes follow-
ing the selected text. Several people can comment, and each has a different 
colored comment box. Comments are dated and contain the name of the 
person commenting. To add a comment, follow these steps:

257
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
 
1. Place your insertion point where you want a comment to appear and 
then choose Insert➪Comment.
 
 A box with your name, the date, and the time appears.
 
2. Start typing in the comment box. When you finish typing the com-
ment, click elsewhere in the document.
 
 Your comment appears as shaded text; refer to Figure 15-4.
 
3. To edit your comment or to change its color, click your comment.
 
 A menu appears giving you the following options: Close This Menu, 
Delete Comment, and Insert Comment Text into Document. You can also 
select a color to change the color box around your comment from this 
menu.
 
4. Ignore the menu and start typing to enter your thoughts into the 
comment.
Inserting special characters
Now and again, you need a character that isn’t found on your keyboard. 
These special characters can include anything from a copyright symbol (©), 
a registered trademark (®), or an Albanian schwa (ë). (See the copyright 
symbol at the top of Figure 15-4.)
To insert a special character, click the spot where you want to place 
the character and choose Insert➪Special Characters. The Insert Special 
Character dialog box appears, shown in Figure 15-7, giving you hundreds of 
choices. If you don’t see the character you need, select the Asian Characters, 
Wingdings, or Advanced options.
 
Figure 15-7: 
Pick your 
favorite 
symbols and 
umlauts.
 

258
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
The Advanced option enables you to pick the Unicode value for nearly any 
character in the world in every major language. Unicode values assign num-
bers for every character in every major, and some minor, alphabets through-
out the world. Many special characters also have their own Unicode values. 
There are literally tens of thousands of options.
If you need help with Unicode values, click Advanced and then click the Help 
question mark in the Advanced dialog box. From there, you can search for 
your language (even Bengali or Syriac) and find the numerical code for any 
special character that you may need.
Inserting horizontal lines and page breaks
Horizontal lines can be placed in a document as a separator between sec-
tions or paragraphs. It’s like drawing a line with a pencil horizontally across 
a piece of paper. (Refer to Figure 15-4.) Create a horizontal line by simply 
choosing Insert➪Horizontal Line.
A page break is used to separate pages for printing. When you insert a page 
break, you force the printer to start printing on a new page. Create a page 
break by choosing Insert➪Page Break (For Printing). The page break appears 
as a faded double broken line, as shown at the bottom of Figure 15-4. Use this 
option to control the amount of text on a single page, pushing the remaining 
text to the next page. Don’t worry; the broken double line doesn’t appear in 
your printed document. To delete a page break, just select and delete the 
faded double line from the document.
Inserting headers and footers
Headers create a space at the top of a document for information. (Refer to 
Figure 15-4.) Footers leave space for information at the bottom of a document. 
In traditional school reports, headers and footers often contain such things 
as page numbers, author names, the name of the instructor, or the course 
name. In business reports, the name of the company often appears in either 
the footer or the header on every page, as shown in the example of Ardsley 
Books in Figure 15-4. After they’re entered, both headers and footers appear 
on every page when the document is printed. To create one, open the Insert 
menu and choose Header or Footer.

Building Powerful Tables
Tables create little boxes in a grid pattern inside a document. These make 
up rows and columns that can be used to organize information in a valuable 
and visual way. (See Figure 15-8.) For example, you can organize data about 
events, people, objects, and places.
 
Figure 15-8:

Follow these steps to create a table:
 
1. Click Insert Table from the Table menu.
 
 The Insert Table dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15-9.
 
2. Define the rows and columns for your table. 
 
 Tables are calculated by the number of its columns and rows. Figure 
15-9 shows a 3-x-6 table being created — three rows, six columns, and 18 
cells.
 
3. To create a basic table, click Insert.
 
 To discover how to design a more interesting table by changing its 
settings, review the “Optional table settings” section that follows.

Optional table settings
 
The Insert Table dialog box shown in Figure 15-9 offers a host of features to 
customize your tables. All the features are optional, and are as follows:
 
✓ Width and Height settings: Width refers to the size of cells horizontally. 
Height refers to the size of cells vertically. The four possibilities are
 
• Full Width/Height: Fits the table, using all the available width 
between the margins of a page. Height is set on the default setting.
 
• Size to Content: Adjusts the width and height of a table’s cells to 
the size of the words or graphics within the cells.
 
• Pixels: Defines the width and height of the cell to a specific number 
of pixels.
 
• Percent: Adjusts cell width and height based on a percentage of the 
available space found between the margins.
 
✓ Columns of Equal Width: Selecting this check box creates a table with 
columns of equal size.
 
✓ Layout settings: Changes the spacing between cells or around words, 
and then aligns or floats the text to the left, right, or center of the cell.
 
• Padding: Refers to the width of the space between the words and 
the outside line of the cells; measured in pixels.
 
• Spacing: Refers to the space between cells; measured in pixels.

261
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
 
• Align: Defines the horizontal position of the words within a cell 
(Left, Center, Right, or None).
 
• Float: Floats the text within a cell. The Left, Right, or None options 
are available from the Float drop-down list.
 
✓ Border Size and Color: To add a border, enter a number in the Size text-
box — the larger the number, the wider the border. To change the color 
of the border, click the Color box and select a color from the palette that 
appears; refer to Figure 15-9.
 
✓ Background Color: To change the background color in the cells, click 
the Color box below Background and select a color from the palette that 
appears.
Editing tables
After you create your table, you can format the text from the toolbar and then 
insert images, links, or anything else from the Insert menu. For example, in Figure 
15-8, columns 2–6 have been centered with color and graphics inserted. Titles 
are bold and the font has been changed. And that’s just a few of the possibilities. 
The Table menu (refer to Figure 15-8) gives you further control over your 
table. From the menu, you can modify, move, insert, or delete an entire table, 
or one or more columns, rows, and cells. The options available are as follows:
 
✓ Modify Tables, Rows, Columns or Cells: After your table is created, 
the Modify options allow you to apply all of the features explained 
in the “Optional table settings” section. Start by selecting the cells, 
rows, or columns you want to alter and choose the appropriate Table 
menu options shown in Figure 15-8. Choose the Table menu followed 
by Modify Table Properties, Modify Row Properties, Modify Column 
Properties, or Modify Cell Properties.
 
✓ Moving Rows: Select the row you want to move and then choose 
Table➪Move Row Up or Table➪Move Row Down. (Refer to Figure 15-8.)
 
✓ Inserting Rows and Columns: Place your insertion point in the column 
or row where you want the new row or column to appear. Choose Table 
menu followed by Insert Row Up, Insert Row Down, Insert Column on the 
Left, or Insert Column on the Right, as shown in Figure 15-8.
 
✓ Deleting Rows and Columns: Select the column or row you want to 
delete. Choose the Table menu followed by Delete Table, Delete Row, or 
Delete the Column. (Refer to Figure 15-8.)
 
Moving existing columns is more problematic than moving rows. Start by 
inserting a new column as explained above. Select and copy the column you 
want to move and paste the information into the new column. Only then 
should you delete the original column of information.

Converting a document to another file type is as easy as picking the document 
or file type you need from the File menu’s Download option and following the 
on-screen instructions. The instructions are self-explanatory. Choose a folder 
on your hard drive in which to place the converted file, and there you have it.
Google Docs converts files into key application file types: 
 
✓ PDF: Adobe’s PDF format, which is used by Acrobat reader, a very popu-
lar online file type that restricts a reader’s ability to make changes. 
 
✓ Word: Microsoft’s Word format; the most universal file type available for 
word-processing documents. 
 
✓ HTML (Zipped): A compressed Web-compatible file type.
 
✓ RTF: A rich text file type that can be read by most word-processing 
applications.
 
✓ Text: A simple text file type that removes all additional formatting and 
images, leaving just the words.
 
✓ OpenOffice: Open source products; very comparable to Microsoft 
Office.
 
The process of converting and downloading does not harm your Google Doc. 
Your original Google copy of your document is unchanged. It’s still safe and 
ready for you to use from your Docs Home.

 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
Saving new copies, reviewing 
revisions, and deleting
Beyond the basics, several File menu commands require brief mention:
 
✓ Save as a New Copy: This feature allows you to retain a copy of a docu-
ment under its original name while creating a duplicate copy that you 
can change without messing up the original.
 
✓ Revision History: This option allows you to look at all of the updates 
made in the history of a Google Doc. Revisions are recorded instead of 
creating multiple copies of revised documents (also known as single-
documindedness). If you need to look at changes that you made, do so by 
choosing approximately how many hours, days, weeks, or months you 
made a change. Click forward or backward to get to the exact revision 
you need. Review Chapter 14 to find more about the Revision History 
feature, shared by all of the apps in Google Docs.
 
✓ Delete: Although this command pretends to delete the current docu-
ment, it doesn’t work that way in practice. Nothing is ever deleted in 
Google Apps until you go to the Docs Home and delete the document by 
empting the digital Trash. (For more, see Chapter 14.)
Print Settings: Orientation, margins,
paper size, and page numbering
When you choose Print Settings from the File menu, the Print Settings dialog 
box appears and gives several key settings from which to choose. (See Figure 
15-10.) After you make your selections, as explained later in this section, 
click OK to make the settings part of your document. Click Print to print your 
document with your new settings or choose Cancel to forget the whole thing 
ever happened.
 
Figure 15-10: 
The Print 
Settings 
dialog box.
 

264
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ Orientation: Orientation changes the direction of the printed pages, 
typically from 8.5 x 11 for Portrait to 11 x 8.5 for Landscape. Portrait 
documents are longer than they are wide. Landscape documents are 
wider than they are long. While most documents are printed in portrait 
orientation, landscape is handy for Web-style documents, wide tables, 
and spreadsheets. 
 
 By default, documents will print with a 1-inch margin in portrait mode. 
However, if you want the file to print like a Web page in landscape mode, 
choose File➪Print as a Web Page. If you want to see how this docu-
ment will look before you print, which is always a good idea, choose 
File➪View as a Web Page.
 
✓ Margins: Margins are set at 1 inch along the top, bottom, left, and right 
margins of a document. You may need to increase those defaults. For 
example, if you’re going to bind a document along its left margin, you 
may want to increase the width of the left margin to 1.5 inches. If you’re 
having trouble fitting your document on a single page, you may want to 
reduce the margins, say to .75 inch, to allow more words on a printed 
page.
 
✓ Paper Size: The default paper size for most documents is 8.5 x 11, as 
shown in the Print Settings dialog box in Figure 15-10. If you need to 
print on legal-size paper or another paper size, change the Paper Size 
settings by clicking the drop-down menu and choosing the correct paper 
size.
 
✓ Annotations/Include Page Numbers: Adding page numbers to a 
document is as easy as choosing the down arrow in the Include Page 
Numbers box and choosing the location of the page number from the list 
that appears. In Figure 15-10, the page number has been placed in the 
bottom center of a printed page.
Changing document settings
If you want to change the default fonts and spacing settings permanently for 
every document you create, choose Edit➪Document Styles. This opens the 
Document Styles dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-11.
Try these steps to change your document styles:
 
1. Change your font style from the default (Verdana) to another font, like 
Narrow or Tahoma.
 
 The preview shows you what the font will look like.
 
2. Change the line spacing from Single Spaced to Double Spaced or 
another line spacing option.
 
3. Don’t select the Right-to-Left orientation unless you are writing in 
Hebrew or Arabic.

265

4. Choose the Make These the Default Styles for All New Documents box 
to apply your new style settings to all new documents. (If you change 
your mind, you can come back and redo the settings or choose Turn 
Off All Styles.)
 
5. Choose Document Background Color if you want a color other than 
white for your on-screen Docs word processor.
The Tools and Help menus
The Tools menu can be used to start and stop your spell checking, count 
the words in your document, review your revision history (as explained 
in Chapter 14), and edit your bookmarks. The Tools menu also provides 
multilingual support for spell checking. The spell checker inside Docs and 
Spreadsheets defaults to Auto, picking the language currently in use by the 
browser. If you’re using your browser in English, the English vocabulary 
spell checker will be auto-selected. However, if you need to switch the spell 
checker to another language, such as Spanish, Arabic, French, or Dansk, do 
so by clicking Tools➪Language and choosing the target language.
 
If you need answers to your questions, which should be a lot fewer after read-
ing this chapter, click the Help menu. As you’d expect from Google, all of its 
Help files are found online. Access the Google Docs Help Center, participate 
in an online forum with other Google Docs users, or watch YouTube videos of 
tips and tricks by choosing Help➪Watch a Video Introduction. You can also 
click a link that takes you to all of the available keyboarding shortcuts — a 
typist’s delight.

Publishing to Sites and Other Places
The Publish as a Web Page feature allows you to post online versions of your 
documents, upload copies to one of your Sites, or post copies to a company 
or personal blog. Click the Share tab’s down arrow and choose Publish as a 
Web Page to explore the options. Immediately, you see two choices: Publish 
Document and Post to Blog. We talk about both choices in separate sections.
Publish a document online
Publishing is as easy as clicking the Publish Document button. As soon as 
you do, you’re taken to the Publish This Document screen, shown in Figure 
15-12, which displays the Web address where your document can be viewed. 
You can select and copy the link, and share it with anyone you want via your 
e-mail or instant messaging clients. You can also post the link on any of your 
Google Sites or Web pages. Clicking the link takes you straight to your pub-
lished page for a quick preview.
 
Figure 15-12: 
Set the 
publishing 
settings.
 
You need to know about four additional publishing options:
 
✓ Re-Published Document: If you make changes to your document, press 
the Re-Publish Document button to upload the latest copy to the pub-
lishing site.
 
✓ Automatically Re-Publish When Changes Are Made: If you get tired of 
updating the published document every time you make a change, click 
this option and the latest copy is re-published for you every time you 
alter something.

267
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
 
✓ Viewers Must Sign In with Their Account to View the Published 
Document: To limit viewership to just those within your immediate 
intranet or domain, place a check mark in this box.
 
✓ Stop Publishing: If you need to stop publishing a document for any 
reason, say the information is outdated or you’re being sued for copy-
right infringement, click the Stop Publishing button. It’s the modern day 
equivalent of the call to “Stop the Press.”
Publishing to a blog
To publish a document to a specific blog location, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Share➪Publish as a Web Page➪Post to Blog.
 
 The Blog Site Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-13.
 
Figure 15-13: 
Enter the 
settings for 
your blog.
 
 
2. Select the Hosted Provider radio button if your blog is on a major 
blogging service, and then choose the name of the service from the 
Provider drop-down list. If you host your own blog, select the My Own 
Server/Custom radio button.
 
 If you select the My Own Server/Custom radio button, you can enter all 
the data necessary to upload directly to your personal, corporate, or 
organization Web site or the blog associated with it. Be sure to complete 
each field in the detailed sign-in options, as shown in Figure 15-14. If you 
don’t know the information, ask your system administrator for advice.
 
3. Enter your username and password in the User Name and Password 
textbox to sync with the site.
 
4. (Optional) Enter the name of your blog in the Blog ID/Title textbox.
 
5. Click OK when you’re ready to post the document to your blog.

The Post to Blog feature works extremely well with Blogger, Google’s free 
blogging software (check out www.blogger.com). You can also publish 
directly to a start page or Sites gadget, which you may find extremely valuable 
for team or company announcements. Of course, you need to know the various 
passwords and login names for whatever online site you’re publishing to.
 
If you need to peek under the hood and edit the actual HTML code that 
displays your published online document, you can do so by choosing 
Edit➪Edit HTML. The same applies to those publishing CSS, or Cascading 
Style Sheets. This feature is available for Google Docs, Spreadsheets, and 
Presentations. For more information, review this topic in Chapter 14. 
Sharing, Collaborating, 
and Working Offline
If you haven’t tried sharing and collaborating, you’re in for a treat. This section 
gives you the bare-bones essentials for sharing Google word-processing 
documents. This is a shared feature between all Google Docs and Spreadsheet 
apps, so if you need more details, refer to Chapter 14.)
Sharing gives recipients access to the document in their Docs Home. When 
they have a copy, they can open it and make changes simultaneously with 
you and other recipients. All changes are monitored so you can return to 
earlier revisions if someone makes a mistake.

269
 Chapter 15: Docs: Google’s Word-Processing App
A quick way to share a document is to just e-mail it! To do so, click the Share 
tab’s down arrow and choose Email as Attachment. An e-mail screen appears 
that you can use to pen a note to your recipients.
Another way to share is with the Share with Others feature. After selecting this 
option, add the e-mail addresses for all participants. A notification is generated 
so they will know they have access and can begin working on the document.
To start sharing with others, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share tab’s down arrow and then choose Share with Others.
 
2. Choose one of the following options:
 
• Select the As Collaborators radio button to allow the people that 
you invite to make changes to the document.
 
• Select the As Viewers radio button to restrict the people you invite 
so that they can read the document but not make changes.
 
3. In the Invite People section textbox, enter the e-mail addresses of the 
people with whom you want to share the document.
 
4. (Optional) Select any or all of the check boxes in the Advanced 
Permissions section.
 
• Collaborators May Invite Others: Give or deny your collaborators 
the right to invite other collaborators or viewers by selecting (to 
grant) or deselecting (to deny) the check box.
 
• Invitations May Be Used by Anyone: Allow or disallow collaborators 
the right to broadcast the page to mailing lists by selecting (to 
allow) or deselecting (to disallow) this check box.
 
• Anyone from <your domain> May <selection> This Document at: 
Allow only users within a company or organization to view the 
document by requiring them to log in.
 
5. Click the Invite Collaborators button.
 
 An invitation screen appears. Treat this screen exactly like an e-mail 
message. Your collaborators and viewers automatically appear in the 
To box.
 
6. Click the Subject textbox and type a subject. Then click the Message 
textbox and type a message to your collaborators.
 
7. (Optional) If you want to paste a copy of the document into the e-mail 
message, do so by selecting the Paste the Document Itself into the 
Email Message check box.
 
8. Click the Send button to send the invitation.

Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
Multiple collaborators can enter data or change formatting on the same docu-
ment at the same time. Shared documents are saved every time you blink (or 
so it seems) to protect the changes collaborators are making. And don’t worry 
if someone makes a mistake. All the changes are tracked to maintain quality 
control. You can always revert to a previous version. To find out how, read 
more about revision histories in Chapter 14.
 
Your Google Docs are available to you anytime from any online computer 
anywhere in the world. And, if you’re away from an Internet hotspot and you 
need to work offline on a document, Google Gears allows you to do just that 
by accessing a link in the Header section. For more, see Chapter 14.

Calculating with Google 
Spreadsheets
In This Chapter
▶ Starting Spreadsheets and covering the basics
▶ Creating charts, graphs, and gadgets
▶ Applying formulas and functions
▶ Converting spreadsheets to other formats
▶ Sharing, publishing, printing, and collaborating with spreadsheets
S
preadsheets perform calculations and organize data, especially 
numeric data. Sounds like a snoozer, but the more people know about 
spreadsheets, the more they wake up to their value. And regardless of 
whether someone’s number-crunching needs are lightweight or heavy duty, 
Google Spreadsheets makes an impression and gets the job done. Google 
Spreadsheets can help you:
 
✓ Juggle a bundle of numbers for a family budget.
 
✓ “Number crunch” mountains of data with colleagues.
 
✓ Create clever charts, graphs and gadgets for an upcoming report.
 
✓ Create a spreadsheet with fiendishly complex formulas.
 
✓ Publish a spreadsheet online to impress a client with your digital 
acumen.
Starting Up a Spreadsheet
When you’re ready to create a new spreadsheet, log into your Google Docs 
Home by launching it from a Google gadget, clicking the Documents link atop 
an open Google app (see Chapter 15), or launching it directly from a Web 
browser. Next, you have to sign in, which you can do one of two ways:

272
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ Google Account users: Go to http://docs.google.com and enter 
your login name and password in the Sign In box on the right side of the 
screen. Then click the Sign In button.
 
✓ Google Apps users: Go to http://docs.google.com/a/your
domain.com and enter your username and password in the Sign In box 
on the left side of the screen. Then click Sign In.
Create a new spreadsheet from the Docs Home page by clicking New ➪
Spreadsheet from the menu that appears. Google Spreadsheets opens a new, 
blank spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 16-1.
 
Figure 16-1: 
A new, 
unsaved 
spread-
sheet.
 
Start autosaving immediately
 
Google Spreadsheets wants to start autosaving immediately so that you don’t 
lose any important cell entries. Enabling autosaving means that Spreadsheets 
will begin automatically saving your spreadsheet. A few moments after you 
create a new spreadsheet, a popup message appears, encouraging you to turn 
on autosaving. Click the Start Autosaving link (refer to Figure 16-1); a dialog 
box appears in which you can name your spreadsheet.
Note: The sample spreadsheet that you see in the figures in this chapter 
organizes statistics about five former British Colonies and the order in 
which they received independence. Incidentally, we want to visit all these 
places — no offense to the Falkland Islands or the 50 other members of the 
Commonwealth.
After you save, the file name appears in the header at the top of the screen. If 
you’re not happy with the file name and need to make a change, here’s how 
you do it:

273
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
 
1. Click the file’s current name in the header or Choose File➪Rename.
 
2. If your browser prompts you to allow scripts, follow the on-screen 
instructions to do so. Then choose File➪Rename or click the tempo-
rary name in the Docs Header again.
 
3. Enter the new name in the dialog box.
Getting familiar with Spreadsheets’ 
header, menus, and tabs
Atop the Google Spreadsheet App are the header, menus, and tabs: the 
power center of spreadsheet activities. In the header, you see the familiar 
Docs Home, Help, and Sign Out links. (See Figure 16-2.) Your login name, 
the file’s name, and the date the spreadsheet was last saved appears in the 
header.
 
Figure 16-2: 
The header, 
menu bar, 
and tool-
bar in the 
Spread-
sheets app.
 
Cells, rows, and columns
Like all spreadsheets, Google’s online version 
is a grid. Each rectangle in the grid is a cell. The 
cells are organized horizontally in rows and ver-
tically in columns:
 ✓ Rows: Numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on.
 ✓ Columns: Lettered A, B, C, and so on. When 
the spreadsheet runs out of letters in the 
alphabet, it doubles up the letters and starts 
using AA, AB, AC, and so on; then BA, BB, 
BC, and on and on it goes.
 ✓ Cells: Identified by the intersection of a row 
and column. This is the cell address. For 
instance, cell D8 is located at the intersec-
tion of column D and row 8.

274
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Below the header, the File menu and several tabs power the spreadsheet. In 
this list, we briefly describe each key menu and tab.
 
✓ File menu: Contains familiar File menu features, such as New, Import, 
Open, Create a copy, Rename, Print, and Save & Close. It also includes a 
Revision History and an Export function.If you need to export a spread-
sheet to another file type, this is the menu you need.
 
✓ Edit menu: Allows editing options like Undo/Redo, and Cut, Copy, and 
Paste. The Find and Replace and Search the Web features are helpful. In 
a spreadsheet, important functions include deleting rows and columns, 
past formats and values, defining ranges of numerical values, and clear-
ing selections.
 
✓ Format Menu: Lets you apply typical formatting elements like bold, 
italic, underline, strikethrough, and color options. You can also clear 
styles with this option.
 
✓ Insert Menu: Allows you and your collaborators to insert rows above or 
below a selected row or to add a column to the left or right of selected 
columns. You can also insert formulas, charts, comments, gadgets, or 
images from this powerful menu.
 
✓ Tools Menu: Allows users to sort columns and rows alphabetically and 
numerically. An important link allows you to freeze the top few rows or 
columns so they never disappear no matter what.
 
✓ Form Menu: Allows you to create a form using Spreadsheets that make 
data entry easy and consistent for you and other users with whom you 
share your spreadsheet forms. 
 
✓ Help Menu: Google’s Help Center is available from the Help menu. There 
is also a helpful video introduction and a list of keyboard shortcuts. 
One of the most helpful features is the Formula builder, which lets you 
choose from hundreds of precreated formulas so that you don’t need to 
figure them out for yourself.
 
✓ Share Button: Permits the sharing of spreadsheets to whomever you 
like. Allows you to restrict changes that viewers can make.
Entering values and moving around
Any data entered into a cell is a value. The most common values are
 
✓ Numbers or numerical values: Used for calculations. Numerical values 
include both numbers and a few symbols, such as +, –, the comma as a 
separator, and the percent sign (%).
 
✓ Text values: Letters or words.
 
✓ Labels: Text values that act like headings or titles to identify columns or 
rows of values.

275
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
You can enter values only into an active cell. Make a cell active by click-
ing it or by using the keyboard as described in Table 16-1. Active cells are 
highlighted by darkened lines around its four sides. In Figure 16-3, cell A2 is 
active. After you make a cell active, you can enter values directly into that 
slightly expanded cell.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Enter values 
directly into 
an active 
cell.
 
After you enter a value into the cell, you must activate another cell for the 
values to update in the spreadsheet. (You need to take this step in all spread-
sheets.) For example, in Figure 16-3, we added six text labels and made cell 
A2 active. You can update values in a cell in several ways. Start by clicking a 
cell and entering the values, and then
 
✓ Press Enter, Tab, or any of the arrow keys.
 
✓ Click a different cell.

Selecting multiple cells
You can select a single cell by clicking it. You can also move to a cell using 
the navigation keys described in Table 16-1. To select a range of cells, either
 
✓ Use the mouse: Click a cell and drag to highlight all the cells you want to 
select.
 
✓ Use the keyboard: Navigate to a cell and then hold Shift as you use the 
arrow keys to highlight the cells you want to select.
 
You can select an entire row by clicking the row header, or select an entire 
column by clicking the column header. Alternatively, press Ctrl+Shift+right 
arrow to pick a row or Ctrl+Shift+down arrow to pick a row.

277
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
Formatting multiple cells
You can put information in a spreadsheet as simply as clicking a cell and 
typing. Generally, text values are short — most often, just a few words in any 
given cell. Spreadsheets aren’t the place for longwinded ramblings — save 
that for Blogger.
Figure 16-3 shows a portion of a spreadsheet comparing a few former British 
Colonies in the order of their independence. To start the worksheet, we 
entered the words Number, Year (for the year of independence), Nation, 
Population, Area (for land area), and Density (for population density) into the 
first six columns of the first row.
You can format all six text values at the same time by selecting the six cells 
(or selecting the entire row by clicking the 1 at the beginning of the row). 
Then start clicking the formatting buttons: Bold, Italic, Font style, and so on. 
In Figure 16-4, we selected cells A1 to F1 as a group. We made the labels bold 
and shaded, applied a different color, and increased to an 18-point font.
 
Figure 16-4: 
Format 
values in 
multiple 
cells by 
using the 
Edit toolbar.
 
Changing the column width or row height
In Figure 16-4, the label Population is too long for the width of the column. 
The word is simply too big, so you can’t see all of it. You can resolve this 
issue quickly — just adjust the width of the column. Hover your mouse 
pointer directly over the line between the column headers. A thick blue line 
with a double-sided arrow appears over it — this line is called the Column 
Width slider. Click and drag the line to the left or right to resize the entire 
column. (You can also double-click on the line between columns or rows to 
resize the column or row to the left of the line.)
The same technique works for resizing rows, too — hover the mouse pointer 
over the line between row headers until the two-sided arrow appears, and 
then click and drag up or down to resize the height of a row.

278
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Entering sequences quickly 
with the Fill Handle
One of the important features in any spreadsheet is its ability to automati-
cally anticipate patterns and increment values in adjacent cells. For example, 
say we need to create a list of numbers from 1 to 5. When we enter 1 in Cell 
A2 and 2 in Cell A3, Spreadsheets recognizes a pattern and can fill in the rest 
of the numbers in the sequence.
To use the Fill Handle to complete a sequence quickly, follow these steps:
 
1. Enter the first few values in the sequence into their cells.
 
 For example, enter 5 in one cell and 10 in another cell if you want to 
make Spreadsheets count by fives. (Note: The cells must be touching — 
in either the same row or the same column, such as cells B1 and B2, or 
cells A6 and B6.)
 
2. Select the cells as described in the “Selecting multiple cells” section.
 
 In the bottom-right corner of the selected cells, a little dark square 
appears. This square is the Fill Handle.
 
3. Click the Fill Handle and drag it down (to fill in a sequence within a 
column) or right (to fill in a sequence within a row). You can also fill 
cells by dragging up or to the left.
 
 Google Spreadsheets fills in the pattern to all selected cells. 
 
The same technique works for almost any sequence or pattern, such as:
 
✓ Days of the week
 
✓ Months of the year
 
✓ Multiple years
 
✓ Formulas (see the section, “Formula Fixin’,” later in this chapter)
 
✓ Other types of data in which a pattern is obvious, such as counting by 
threes, fives, or tens
Changing values and undoing mistakes
To change or edit an existing value in any cell, double-click the offending cell 
to make it active and then make the desired change. Press Enter or click a dif-
ferent cell to make Spreadsheets accept the new value.

279
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
 
 If you make a mistake (and we all make mistakes), click the Undo button on 
the Edit toolbar or press Ctrl+Z. If you make a mistake with your undo, click 
the Redo button or press Ctrl+Y to undo the Undo you just undid (phew!).
Inserting new rows or columns
You need to plan spreadsheets, but you can’t anticipate everything. 
Fortunately, you can insert rows and columns anywhere you need them. 
To add a row or column, follow these steps:
 
1. To add a row, highlight the entire row by clicking the number at the 
beginning of the row; to add a column, highlight the entire column by 
clicking the letter at the top of the column.
 
2. Click the Insert menu and choose the appropriate command from the 
menu’s drop-down list.
 
• If you select a row in Step 1, choose either Row Above or Row 
Below from the menu.
 
• If you select a column in Step 1, choose either Column Left or 
Column Right from the menu.
Merging and aligning cells
 
 When you enter text that’s too long to appear in its entirety in a cell, you can 
adjust the column width. But sometimes you don’t want a column to be that 
wide — for example, if you have a long title for a spreadsheet. In that case, 
use the Merge Across button to merge two or more cells together.
To merge cells, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a cell and enter text.
 
2. Select the cells that you want to merge.
 
3. Click the Merge Across button from the toolbar.
 
 Google Spreadsheets merges the cells together, and any text that you 
enter in the cell in Step 1 spreads across the newly merged cell.
 
If you want to break a merged cell back into separate cells, select the merged 
cell and click the Break Apart button on the Toolbar. (The Merge Across and 
Break Apart button are in the same position on the toolbar.)

You probably want to center align the text in a merged cell. To align text (or 
numbers), select the cell(s), row(s), or column(s) that you want to align, and 
then click the Align button on the Edit toolbar. Choose the alignment that 
you want from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 16-5.
For example, in Figure 16-5, we
 
✓ Centered the title in row 1
 
✓ Aligned Column B’s text values to the right
 
✓ Aligned the values in column C to the left
 
Figure 16-5: 
Select 
entire rows 
or columns 
and then 
apply align-
ments or

Deleting rows and columns
Delete rows and columns much like you insert rows and columns. If you have 
an extra column or row that you don’t want, simply select the entire row or 
column by clicking its number or letter, respectively, and then click the Edit 
menu followed by Delete Row or Delete Column.
Formatting numbers
 
 Number values can take many forms. Google Spreadsheets can represent 
numbers as digits, percentages, and currency values with or without 
decimals and commas. You can change these forms, called number formats, 
by clicking the More Formats button on the Toolbar. For example, by clicking 
More Currencies in the menu that appears under the More Formats button, 
you can see a list of supported currencies.
Even dates and times have their unique formats. You can use a 24-hour clock 
or a 12-hour clock; you can use an American month/day/year format or the 
day/month/year format most other countries use.

281
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
To apply a number format, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the columns, rows, or cells that you want to change.
 
2. Click the More Formats button on the toolbar and choose the number 
or date formats that you need from the menu that appears.
Freezing rows and columns
You will need to freeze certain cells at the top and on the left-hand side 
of certain spreadsheets. Freezing locks cells in position so that when you 
scroll down the spreadsheet, those rows remain at the top of the screen no 
matter how long the spreadsheet gets. For example, if we expand our sample 
spreadsheet to include 50 new rows for the current members of the British 
Commonwealth, we need to freeze the top two rows. By freezing the labels in 
the topmost rows, you can scroll down to row 20, row 50, or row 5,000 and 
still read the labels at the top of each column.
You can freeze rows in two ways:
 
✓ Click the Tools menu followed by Freeze Rows or Freeze Columns as 
needed. From the menu that appears, select how many rows or columns 
you want to freeze. In Figure 16-6, we selected Freeze 2 Rows from the 
menu.
 
✓ Click and drag the Freeze/Sort bar (shown above or below Row 1) down 
a couple of rows, as indicated in Figure 16-6.

To unfreeze rows, click the Sort tab, click the Frozen Rows or Frozen 
Columns button, and select No Frozen Headers or No Frozen Columns, 
respectively, from the menu that appears. You can also drag the Freeze/Sort 
bar to the top of the spreadsheet.
Sorting from A to Z and Z to A
Sorting text and numbers is one of the essential power-user features of 
Google Spreadsheets. You can sort in two ways:
 
✓ A to Z: Sort alphabetically from A to Z or numerically from one to infinity.
 
✓ Z to A: Sort alphabetically from Z to A or numerically from infinity to one.
Google Spreadsheets gives you two sorting options. You can sort by any 
column that you want by using either the Freeze/Sort bar or the Sort tab. For 
example, to sort data alphabetically (or numerically) you can
 
✓ Click the Freeze/Sort bar above the column you want to sort, and select 
A→Z.
 
✓ Highlight the column that you want to sort by, click the Tools menu, and 
click the Sort By Column A→Z button.
Either way you choose, Spreadsheets sorts all the data in the adjacent rows 
to reflect your sort. (In Figure 16-7, the country with the lowest population 
would move to the top of the list.)
If you want to reverse the sort order (for example, place the country with the 
greatest population at the top), repeat the sort process, but this time, click 
Z→A.

Using Charts, Graphs, and Diagrams
 
 If you are graphically deprived, you can easily overcome this ailment by cre-
ating charts and graphs with Google Spreadsheets. To create a chart, simply 
select labels and the related numbers (called a range), and then click the Add 
Chart button on the Edit toolbar.
Google Spreadsheets lets you display information by using many different 
charting and graphing styles, including:
 
✓ Column charts
 
✓ Bar charts
 
✓ Line graphs
 
✓ Pie charts
 
✓ Scatter diagrams
The next few sections discuss how to create and manage your charts.
Defining a range of data for your chart
Before you create a chart, a graph, or even some gadgets, you must define 
your data range. When creating a chart, it’s helpful to select labels (at either 
the top of columns or the beginning of rows) and then choose data that cor-
responds with your labels. For example, in Figure 16-8, we chose three former 
British Colonies, their populations, and their land areas by selecting a range 
of cells from C5 to E7.
You define a range by clicking a beginning cell in the upper-left corner of 
the data set and extending down to the lower-right cell in the data set. 
Spreadsheets typically separate a range with a colon (:). For example, C5:E7 
means, “Look at cells C5, E7, and everything in between.” Spreadsheets will 
add the colon (:) automatically in most cases, but if it doesn’t, you can add it 
manually.
 
Figure 16-8: 
Select your 
data range.
 

284
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Creating a chart
After you decide what range you want, follow these steps to create a chart:
 
1. Select the range by clicking and dragging over the desired cells.
 
2. Select Chart from the Insert menu.
 
 The Create Chart dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-9.
 
3. Select the charting options according to how you want your chart 
to look.
 
 You can select different options in the following areas:
 
• What Type: Click one of the icons in the What Type section — 
Columns, Bars, Lines, Pie, or Scatter. You can refine your choice 
by clicking one of the Sub Type icons, which includes variations on 
the chart type selected.
 
 You need to decide which type of chart can represent your data in 
the best possible way. For instance, you could compare the popu-
lation of the United States with that of Australia and Kenya (refer 
to the data range in Figure 16-8) in a visually appealing pie chart. 
However, the selection of cells in Figure 16-8 includes Population 
and Area. Pie charts are not effective with multiple comparisons 
and may not represent this type of data properly; you might find a 
column or bar chart to be better choices in this example.
 
• What Data: The cell range that you select in Step 1 appears in the 
What Data textbox. You can also choose how to group the data 
by selecting either the Rows or the Columns radio button. Select 
one of the check boxes (Use Row X as Labels or Use Column X as 
Labels) to tell Google Spreadsheets where to find the labels for the 
chart.
 
• Labels: Click the Chart Title, Horizontal Axis, and Vertical Axis text-
boxes, and enter labels for those parts of the chart. Choose where 
you want the legend to appear on your chart from the Legend 
drop-down list — you can choose No Legend, On Right, On Left, On 
Top, or On Bottom.
 
 If you set your spreadsheet up by attaching either column or row 
labels to a range of numerical data, the labels automatically appear 
as a legend in the chart. (See Figure 16-9.)
 
 Depending on the chart type, you can add a title and place sub-
titles on the horizontal and vertical axes. You may find labeling the 
horizontal and vertical axes especially helpful when you create a 
column, bar, or line chart.

285
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
 
• Preview: Look at the Preview window to see how your changes 
affect the chart.
 
4. Click the Save Chart button in the bottom-right corner of the Create 
Chart dialog box.
 
 Your chart appears at the top of your spreadsheet.

Managing charts
After you place a chart in your spreadsheet, you’re not finished! You can do 
more. Just click the chart to activate it, and then click the down arrow at the 
top of the chart window. From the Chart menu that appears, you have the fol-
lowing options:
 
✓ Edit Chart: Change the look or data range of your chart.
 
✓ Delete Chart: Get rid of the chart and start over. Careful, after it’s gone, 
it’s gone for good.
 
✓ Save Image: Save your chart as a graphic file to use in other documents.
 
✓ Publish Chart: Publish your chart online for others to view easily. (For 
more on publishing, see the “Publishing and Printing Spreadsheets” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.) 
 
✓ Move to Own Sheet: Move your chart to its own browser Web page 
apart from the spreadsheet data that created it. This makes your chart 
much bigger and easier to view.

Creating gadgets and maps
In the online world, where Google resides, gadgets are popping up faster than 
housing subdivisions during the baby boom. Gadgets go from the fun to the 
functional, and range from the powerful to the perfunctory.
You insert gadgets in a spreadsheet the same way you insert graphics in a 
document or video in a presentation. So many new gadgets are created each 
month, however, that you’ll want to preview your options. To view some 
possible gadgets, choose Insert➪Gadget. This opens the Add a Gadget dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 16-10.
 
Figure 16-10: 
Find your 
Gadget 
favorites.
 
Most gadgets require a value from the spreadsheet. For example, the Gauges 
gadget (see Figure 16-10) requires numeric values. The Maps gadget requires 
a place value. In Figure 16-11, we chose Belize for the Map gadget created for 
that country.

Formula Fixin’
Formulas are mathematical expressions that solve numeric problems. Don’t 
let this technical definition deter you from using formulas — Google has 
made them easy to use and understand. Formulas use familiar operators, 
such as those shown in Table 16-2.
Table 16-2 
Mathematical Operators
Operator
Meaning
Used To
+
Addition or plus sign
Adds two or more numbers 
together
–
Subtraction or negative sign
Subtracts numbers or indicate a 
negative number
*
Multiplication sign
Multiplies two or more numbers 
together
/
Division sign
Divides numbers or indicate a 
fraction
^
Exponential notation sign
Indicates that the number 
following the caret (^) is an 
exponent
( )
Parentheses
Groups part of a formula to 
indicate that operation should 
be performed first

288
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
You can write formulas that use these operators directly into any cell to 
perform simple mathematical calculations. To enter a formula into a cell, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell and enter =.
 
 A formula starts with an = (equal) sign. The = sign is a trigger that tells 
the spreadsheet to start calculating.
 
2. Type the formula.
 
 You can use rather simple formulas, involving a single operator, or 
much more complicated formulas, involving multiple operators, multiple 
cell references, and the order of operations. 
 
3. Press Enter to enter the formula in the cell.
 
 After you enter a formula, that formula disappears, and you see only the 
answer to that formula.
To view or change the formula itself, you must double-click the cell again to 
make the formula reappear. You can now change the formula the same way 
you change any value.
Take a peek at a few sample formulas in Table 16-3.

Using cell references and 
selecting a range
When performing your magical spreadsheet wizardry, save time by using cell 
references (you remember — cell addresses like A1 or E5). Any formula can 
reference any numerical value in any cell. If the numerical values change, the 
formulas automatically update their calculations.

289
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
You can perform calculations on a bunch of numbers in a row or column by 
defining a cell range inside a formula. For example, C5:D7 means that all the 
numbers from cell C5 down to cell D7 are included as part of the range. When 
you use a cell range in a formula, the beginning and ending cells are sepa-
rated with a colon and are enclosed in parentheses, such as (A1:F15). (See 
the section “Defining a range of data for your chart,” earlier in this chapter, 
for an explanation of cell ranges.)
To select a range, click the top-left cell and drag to the bottom-right cell. 
Using this method, you can add the entire range automatically to your for-
mula and the colon (:) will be added automatically.
Built-in functions
Functions define the type of operation that a spreadsheet will perform. 
Functions are built into Google Spreadsheets. You, as the spreadsheet user, 
can choose from hundreds of functions. A few of the more commonly used 
functions appear when you select Formula from the Insert menu, providing 
you one-click access. We explain these functions in Table 16-4.
Table 16-4 
A Few Built-in Functions
Function
How It’s Written into a 
Formula
What It Does
Sum
=Sum(range)
Adds all the numbers in a range 
to find a sum total
Min
=Min(range)
Finds the lowest number in a 
range
Max
=Max(range)
Finds the highest number in a 
range
Count
=Count(range)
Counts how many cells contain 
numbers in the range
Average
=Average(range)
Averages all the numbers in a 
range
You can see how functions work inside formulas by looking at a few examples. 
We applied the Sum, Min, Max, Count, and Average functions in our sample 
colonial spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 16-12. We used each function in a 
formula that has a range, applied from the Population column. Each formula 
and function uses the same range, (D3:D7); for example, =Sum(D3:D7) and 
=Average(D3:D7). Also in Figure 16-12, we added a label for each function in 
column D to show how the functions calculate.

290
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
Figure 16-12:
 You can 
apply basic 
functions to 
a range of 
data.
 
Follow these steps to use a function in a formula:
 
1. Click the Formulas tab.
 
2. Click the cell in which you want the formula and function to reside.
 
3. Click the function link that you need in the upper-right corner of the 
Formulas tab (for example, Sum, Max, or Product).
 
 The Average link was clicked in Figure 16-12.
 
4. Click and drag over the range of numbers that you want to calculate.
 
5. Press Enter.
 
 You don’t need to type the parenthesis if you follow the steps in the 
right order. If a mistake is made, click Undo and try again, or enter the 
formula by hand.
Filling and incrementing formulas
To apply the same functions and formulas from one column to another 
column (or columns), select the cells containing the formulas, click the Fill 
Handle that appears in the corner of the cell, drag it across the columns you 
want to include, and then release the mouse button.
Presto! You’ve created multiple formulas. Also, the spreadsheet applies to 
the range of cells listed in the formula the incremental concept explained in 
the “Entering sequences quickly with the Fill Handle” section. For example, 
instead of applying the formulas by hand to adjacent columns or rows, select 
the cell containing the formula you want first and drag it over to the new 
colomns or rows. You can also use the Copy and Paste commands to copy 
formulas to new cells. How’s that for convenience?

291
 Chapter 16: Calculating with Google Spreadsheets
 
If you don’t want cells to automatically increment when you use the Fill 
Handle, you can add $ to cell references to fix their positions in your formulas. 
For example, using the cell reference ($D$2) prevents the data from cells D2 
from incrementing when copied to other cells. The same applies to a range of 
cells to be copied ($D$2:$D$7).
Advanced and creative online formulas 
If you need to apply more advanced functions into your formulas, click the 
Insert menu, choose Formula, and then select the More Formulas option. The 
Insert a Formula dialog box appears. This dialog box stores every possible 
function you should ever need; at least, Google hopes they’ve accounted for 
everything you might want to do! (See Figure 16-13.) The dialog box divides 
the functions into nine categories to make them easier to scour: Math, 
Financial, Logical, Date, Lookup, Statistical, Text, Info, and Google. (In Figure 
16-13, you can see the Math category on the left side and the Google category 
on the right side.)
Google has supplied some creative, beyond-the-normal spreadsheet functional-
ity that allows you to integrate and update data directly from the Internet into 
a spreadsheet. For example, you can insert stock quotes into a spreadsheet 
(see the sidebar, “Inserting a stock quote,” later in this chapter, for the steps).

Creating multiple sheets
Google Spreadsheets allows you to create multiple sheets in the same 
spreadsheet. (Microsoft Excel calls these sheets worksheets.) You may find 
using multiple sheets extremely helpful. Say you’re working on the company 
budget; you can create a separate sheet for each department or each team.
Sheets can interact with each other. You can use numbers and calculations 
from one sheet in formulas or results on another sheet. For example, if you’re 
calculating multiple expenses from three separate departments, the total 
expenses for multiple departments can appear on a summary balance sheet 
for every sheet in the spreadsheet.
To create a new sheet, simply click the Add Sheet button at the bottom of 
the Google Spreadsheets screen. To make sheets easier to find, you can give 
each sheet a unique name by right-clicking the tab at the bottom of the sheet 
and choosing Rename. You can even rearrange the order of the sheets, if you 
want, by right-clicking the tab at the bottom of the sheet again and choosing 
Move Left or Move Right.
Inserting a stock quote
If you want the current, updated price of a 
stock displayed in a spreadsheet, click the 
Insert menu, choose Formula and select the 
More option. Click the Google category in 
the Insert a Formula dialog box, and select 
the GoogleFinance stock ticker function 
(refer to the right side of Figure 16-13). After 
your spreadsheet inserts the formula, Google 
updates the stock price every few seconds. 
The GoogleFinance function requires 
both a ticker symbol and an attribute. For 
example, =GoogleFinance(“GOOG”; 
“price”). Quotation marks appear around 
the ticker symbol and the attribute, and a semi-
colon is placed between them. These symbols 
and words, and how they’re organized, is called 
the syntax of the formula. You can easily find 
ticker symbols on the http://finance.
google.com Web site. Here are a few 
examples:
 ✓ GOOG for Google
 ✓ MSFT for Microsoft
 ✓ APPL for Apple
Attributes, such as volume and price, are 
important stock information. To find out more 
about attributes of any formula, click the More 
link to the right of the function description at 
the bottom of the Insert a Function dialog box 
to view a Web page that describes all the 
attributes that a function uses.

Sharing and Collaborating 
with Spreadsheets
In Chapter 15, we share with you the what-you-need-to-know-basics for 
sharing Google Docs & Spreadsheets. The instructions are the same for all 
the Google word-processing, spreadsheet and presentations apps. If you 
need more details about sharing, check Chapter 15.
 
Multiple collaborators can enter data or change formatting on the same 
spreadsheet at the same time. Shared spreadsheets are saved every time you 
blink (or so it seems) to protect the changes collaborators are making. And 
don’t worry if someone makes a mistake. All the changes are tracked to main-
tain quality control. You can always revert to a previous version. To find out 
how, jump ahead in this chapter and read the “Revisions and version control” 
section, or reread more about revision histories in Chapter 15.
Keeping a single version of a spreadsheet, while maintaining a record of all 
the changes made to it, is much more efficient than keeping multiple versions 
of the same sheet and trying to reconcile all the changes after the fact. And 
Google Spreadsheets always lets you know who’s currently contributing to the 
spreadsheet by listing the names of collaborators at the bottom of the screen.
Discuss while you work
The discuss panel offers another great feature for spreadsheet collaborators. 
Click on the down arrows next to the name of any participant that appears 
below the Toolbar to activate the discussion feature. This opens the discus-
sion panel, as shown in Figure 16-14. If you’re working with others, you can 
chat about the spreadsheet while you work on it. And, because you can chat 
about almost anything you want, we bet that after a few minutes, chatting 
about the spreadsheet will fall to a low priority.

Revisions and version control
To view changes to a spreadsheet or to revert to an earlier spreadsheet, 
click the File menu followed by the Revision History option and then click 
the Older or Newer buttons to view the various versions. If you decide that 
you want to revert to an earlier version, click the Revert to This One button. 
A dialog box appears, asking you to verify your decision. See Chapter 15 for 
more details on the Revision History feature.
Converting and Exporting 
to Other File Formats
You may need to convert a Google spreadsheet to a file format that desktop 
spreadsheet applications use (think Microsoft Excel, StarOffice Calc, or Lotus 
1-2-3). You can make these conversions by clicking the File menu and select-
ing Export from the menu that appears. Then choose the spreadsheet format 
that you need from the menu that appears to the right of Export. (We explain 
these formats in Table 16-5.) When you select an option, a dialog box appears 
that allows you to set options and parameters for exporting your spread-
sheet. If you’re even remotely familiar with these formats, the screens should 
be self-explanatory.

Publishing and Printing Spreadsheets
The Publish on the Web feature posts an online HTML version of your 
spreadsheet and uploads a copy to your Web site or blog. You may find this 
a nice advantage if you want to share the spreadsheet with audiences beyond 
your collaborators. You access the publishing features by clicking the Share 
button and then clicking the Publish as Web Page.
After you publish your spreadsheet, you can still make changes or upload 
fixes to the spreadsheet publication by clicking the Publish tab again. From 
the update screen that appears, you can republish changes to your docu-
ment, stop publishing altogether, select just the parts that you want to share, 
or select the Automatically Re-Publish When Changes Are Made check box.
You have several ways to print your spreadsheet:
 
✓ Click the File menu and choose Print from the menu that appears.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+P.
All these options open the Print settings dialog box. For the most part, 
stick with the defaults. Unless you have multiple sheets, stick with the cur-
rent sheet. Also, most spreadsheets look better when you print them in 
Landscape (11.5/8.5) with the Fit to Width selection. (See Figure 16-15.)

After you select your print options, the spreadsheet is converted into a PDF 
(Portable Document Format) document for printing. PDF is a great way to 
capture a spreadsheet for permanent storage. You may want to save the PDF 
version of the file to capture the exact document you just printed in an elec-
tronic format. Your PDF files can also be uploaded to your Docs Home.

✓ Slide menu: Permits you to add, duplicate, and delete slides and zoom 
in and out on slide elements.
 
✓ Insert menu: Makes it easy for you to insert textboxes, images, and 
video. You can also add shapes like arrows, circles, triangles, and 
rectangles. Most important, if you have slides you want to add from 
an existing PowerPoint on your computer, you can do that from this 
menu.
 
✓ Arrange menu: Lets you arrange objects, such as shapes, textboxes and 
images by bringing them in front of or behind other elements. You can 
also flip objects upside down and backwards.
 
✓ Share tab: The most important menu in the arsenal; it permits the 
sharing of presentations to whomever you like. It also allows you to 
restrict the changes that viewers can make. 
The all-important Toolbar
The Toolbar gives you all the basics you need to create a presentation — for-
matting text; inserting images, videos, and shapes; and so on. The Toolbar is 
divided into two subsections containing the most frequently used icons or 
buttons described here going from left to right. (Refer to Figure 17-1.)
 
✓ Slide Pane section: Contains icons to help organize slides:
 
• New Slide: Add a new slide to your presentation and choose from 
a variety of slide layouts for each slide.
 
• Duplicate Slide: Select a slide and then use this link to make an 
exact duplicate of the existing slide.
 
• Delete Slide: Remove a slide completely.
 
• Previous/Next Slide: Navigate between slides in the Slide Page 
which brings them up in the Slide Design area.
 
✓ Slide Design section: Contains all of the editing and saving buttons seen 
on a traditional toolbar described in Table 17-1.

 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
Adding Text, Themes, Shapes, 
Video, and Images to Slides
If you’re a beginner, let Presentations make the font size and style decisions 
for you until you get to know the app fairly well. Presentations can make 
your slideshow presentation look good without you having to think too much 
about its design, leaving you free to focus on your message.
Making a new slide
 
 To build your presentation, you need to create new slides. After all, a one-
slide presentation isn’t very interesting — and it’s really short!
To create a new slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Slide button on the Toolbar or pick New followed by 
Presentation from the Edit menu.
 
 The Choose a Slide Layout dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you 
choose among a variety of predefined slide layout options, as shown in 
Figure 17-2.
 
Figure 17-2: 
Select a 
slide lay-
out in the 
Choose a 
Slide Layout 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Click the slide layout that you want.
 
 The new slide appears in the slide design area. Unless you choose the 
Blank slide layout, placeholder text appears in the textboxes defined by 
the slide’s layout.

302
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
For most slides, the Text or Two Columns layouts work well. But choose 
whichever layout fits your content. In our example, we used the Two 
Columns layout. This template places two textboxes side by side, as illus-
trated by the dotted marquees (see Figure 17-2). Additionally, another 
textbox appears at the top that you can use as a title or caption. To enter a 
caption or a column of text, simply click any of the three textboxes and start 
typing. (See the section, “Inserting textboxes and formatting text,” later in 
this chapter, for details.) 
Changing the placeholder text
Each new slide you create positions textboxes and placeholder text where 
you can enter your text, shapes, video, and images. For example, as soon 
as you start a new presentation, Presentations creates a title slide (refer to 
Figure 17-1). Here’s all you have to do to change the text in that slide:
 
1. On the slide, click the Click to Add Title placeholder text.
 
 A textbox appears in its place.
 
2. Click this textbox and type a new title.
 
3. (Optional) You can add a subtitle (such as your name) by clicking 
the Click to Add Subtitle placeholder text, clicking the textbox that 
appears, and typing a subtitle, as shown in Figure 17-3.
 
 After you change the placeholder text, the tiny preview slide in the slide 
pane on the left updates its image.
 
Figure 17-3: 
Enter a 
title and 
subtitle for 
your slide in 
the place-
holders.
 
Changing themes
Themes bring together color schemes, templates, and font choices that are 
designed to work well together. Some artistic person somewhere created the 
themes so that the rest of us can just click and type, and still create a great-
looking presentation.

303
 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
Pick an attractive theme by clicking the Edit menu’s Change Theme com-
mand (refer to Figure 17-1). The Choose Theme dialog box appears, shown in 
Figure 17-4, giving you many premade themes to select.
Presentations offers some great options and avoids any obnoxious color 
schemes. Remember to keep your audience in mind when choosing a theme 
for your presentation. For example, Pink n’ Pretty is very, well, pretty — but 
you should probably avoid it unless you’re Elle Woods (you know, from the 
Legally Blonde movies). For the sample presentation shown in the figures 
throughout this chapter, we use the Chalkboard theme; it’s a stark choice, 
but it shows up well on the black-and-white pages of this book.
 
Figure 17-4: 
Select a 
theme from 
the Choose 
Theme dia-
log box.
 
 
Some old-school presenters say that you should enter all of your content 
into a blank slideshow first, and then select a theme and color scheme later. 
However, we prefer to select a colorful theme right off the bat, and then add 
content. It’s much more fun that way. Colors, stripes, images, fades, and 
textures get the creative juices flowing. After all, presentations are a visual 
medium, so why be boring at the start?
Another value of picking your theme early is that each one has its own 
unique characteristics. You may need to tweak your words and pictures a 
bitso that everything looks readable and balanced for a given theme. And, 
if you suddenly decide that a particular theme isn’t right, you can always 
change it by clicking the Change Theme button and selecting a new theme 
entirely. You’re never stuck with a boring theme.
Inserting textboxes and formatting text
 
 If you’re using a theme, a few default textboxes appear in the slides. To create 
a textbox that doesn’t fit inside the normal template, follow these steps:

304
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
1. Click the Insert Text button or select the Insert menu and choose the 
Text command.
 
 A new textbox appears with the placeholder text Click to Add Content.
 
2. Click the textbox and type away.
 
 You can also paste text that you cut or copy from elsewhere.
 
 You can type, format, and edit text in the textbox. When you finish 
typing, click outside the textbox.
 
3. Move the textbox or resize it as needed to accommodate the text you 
add (you may need to click the textbox to select it), as follows:
 
• Move: Hover your cursor on the side of the textbox; when the 
cursor changes into a cross with four arrows, click and drag to 
move the textbox where you need it.
 
• Resize: Click and drag a corner handle any direction you want to 
reshape and resize a textbox. If you have text inside the textbox, 
the text adjusts to fit the new dimensions.
 
All the formatting tools available in Presentations  work the same way in 
Presentations as they do in Docs or Spreadsheets (click the formatting button 
and type, or select text and click a button to apply that formatting to the 
selected text). They also share the same keyboard shortcuts (if applicable).
Table 17-2 shows the keyboard shortcuts specific to Presentations. (For more 
keyboard shortcuts, see Chapter 15.)

Inserting links
 
 You can add links in your presentation. Placing a hypertext link into your pre-
sentation has advantages. For instance, you can create a list to one of your 
Google Sites pages that lists Web sites or online articles that support your 
presentation. Also, you can put a link to your company or school Web page 
somewhere convenient (such as on the title slide) so that you can link to it 
quickly. To create a link, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Link button from the Toolbar.
 
 The Edit Link dialog box appears. (See Figure 17-5.) You can choose to 
enter a Web address or an Email address.
 
2. Enter your link information.
 
 In the example at the top of Figure 17-5, we entered the URL www.
ardsleybooks.com. (The http:// is added automatically.)
 
3. Click OK.

Clean up with Cut, Copy, and Paste
If you need to clean up your presentation, you can cut, copy, and paste text, 
shapes, and graphics by using the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, and 
Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+X, Ô+C, and Ô+V (Mac). You can also select your 
text and then right-click to open these options in a contextual menu.
 
With some browsers and operating systems, when you cut, copy, and paste, a 
warning dialog box appears, asking whether you want to allow the Web page 
to have access to the system Clipboard. Click the Allow Access button to 
allow temporary access, and then try your operation again.
Inserting shapes
You can add simple shapes to your presentation, such as squares, circles, 
speech bubbles, starbursts, and arrows. For example, you can add arrow 
shapes to create a simple flowchart.
Follow these steps to insert a shape:
 
1. Click the Insert menu and select the Shape command.
 
2. From the pop-out menu that appears, choose the shape that you want 
to insert.
 
 The shape appears in the middle of your slide.
 
3. Move, resize, and recolor the shape, as needed, as follows:
 
• Move: Click and drag the shape to move it into position.
 
• Resize: Click a corner handle (you may need to click the shape first 
to select it), and then drag to resize or reshape the image.
 
• Add color: Click the Paint Bucket or Line Color buttons that 
appear in the top-left corner (you may need to click the shape 
first to select it), and then pick a color square from the menu that 
appears.
Inserting images
A presentation can be boring if it’s all text (even with a theme applied). 
You can add images to your slides to make your presentation more visu-
ally appealing to the audience. You can also insert images that you create in 
Google Spreadsheets, such as charts or graphs.

307
 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
To insert an image into a slide, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Insert Image button from the Toolbar or select the Insert 
menu and choose the Image command.
 
 
 The Insert Image dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Browse button.
 
3. In the Insert Image dialog box that appears, select Browse Your 
Computer for the Image File to Upload to snag a picture from your PC. 
(If you want to link to a Web image, select Specify an Image URL and 
enter the URL to the image.)
 
4. Browse to your picture file, select it, and then click the Open button to 
return to the Insert Image dialog box.
 
 You can use only Web-compatible image files: .jpg, .gif, or .png. 
(Presentations can’t load other types of image files, such as .tif.)
 
 You can insert a chart or graph that you create in Google Spreadsheets. 
(See Chapter 16 for steps to create a chart.) In the Spreadsheet app, 
create your chart or open an existing chart. Click the chart to select 
it, and then click the Chart menu at the top of the chart. Choose Save 
Image from the menu, and click the Save button in the dialog box that 
appears to save the file to your computer. In Presentations, follow Steps 
1 through 3 in this list and select the chart’s image file in the Choose File 
dialog box.
 
5. Click OK in the Insert Image dialog box.
 
 Presentations uploads and inserts a copy of the image file into your 
slide.
 
6. Move and resize the image, as needed.
 
 The default placement of the image, dead center in your slide, is prob-
ably not the right spot. The image is probably too large, as well. You can 
adjust your image as follows:
 
• Move: Click and drag the image to move it into position.
 
• Resize: Click a corner handle (you may need to click the image first 
to select it), and then drag to resize or reshape the image. (Hold 
the Shift key down to enlarge or shrink and retain the same ratio of 
height to width.)
 
If you right-click an image or a shape, a contextual menu appears that allows 
you to delete, cut, or copy the image. You can also choose to make the image 
look like it’s in front of or behind text or another image by right-clicking and 
choosing Bring to Front or Send to Back, respectively. You can use this feature 
to make your presentation more visually appealing.

308
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Inserting video clips
You can add video to your presentation. Adding video is similar to adding a 
graphic or image. Follow these steps to insert a video:
 
1. Click the Insert menu and choose the Insert Video command.
 
2. From the dialog box that appears, search for the video that you want 
to insert.
 
 You can do a YouTube search for a video that works with your 
presentation.
 
3. Move and resize as needed:
 
• Move: Click and drag the video to move it into position.
 
• Resize: Click a corner handle (you may need to click the video first 
to select it), and then drag to resize or reshape the video window.
Organizing Slides
When you have a presentation with several (maybe several dozen) slides, 
you may need to duplicate slides (to make the first and last slides identical, 
or to start a new slide based on a previous slide), delete unneeded slides, 
and even change the order of slides. The following sections show you how to 
create new slides and keep them organized.
The slide pane (sometimes called the slide navigator) is on the left side of the 
Presentations screen. This pane displays thumbnails listing the slide order 
and a caption for each slide. Additionally, you can keep your slides organized 
by deleting, duplicating, reordering, and so on in this pane.
 
 Use the Previous and Next buttons or drag the scroll bar in the slide pane to 
navigate through the slide thumbnails. You can also use the Page Up and 
Page Down keys on your keyboard. You find this pane helpful when you have 
more than five slides and need to skip to a particular slide quickly.
You can rearrange your presentation in the slide pane two ways. You can 
click and drag a slide to change its order. Or, if you right-click any slide in the 
slide pane, a contextual menu appears. This menu allows you to
 
✓ Start presentation from this slide: Pick this option if you want to start 
your presentation from any slide other than the first one. This is a great 
option if you are editing because it allows you to quickly view a slide in 
the middle of the stack without having to start at the beginning.

309
 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
 
✓ Change the order of the slides: Choose Move Slide Up or Move Slide 
Down. (Remember, you can also click and drag a slide in the slide pane 
to change its order.)
 
✓ Create a new slide: Select New Slide. (See the previous section for more 
information on creating a new slide.)
 
✓ Duplicate an existing slide: Select Duplicate Slide. When you duplicate 
a slide, you make an exact copy, including all the text, images, shapes, 
and layout of the existing slide. The duplicate slide appears below the 
original slide in the slide pane. (You can also click and drag a slide while 
holding the Ctrl key on your keyboard to create a duplicate.)
 
✓ Inport slides: Use this feature if you have precreated slides in another 
presentation or PowerPoint file and want to copy and paste them into a 
Google Presentation.
 
✓ Delete a slide: Select Delete Slide. If you accidentally delete a slide, 
press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z (Mac) or click the Undo link in the tool-
bar to restore your slide. You can’t retrieve it after you make any other 
edits.
 
✓ Copy and paste an existing slide: Select Copy Slide. Place the mouse 
cursor where you want the copied slide to appear in the slide pane, 
right-click, and then choose Paste Slide from the menu that appears. 
Your slide appears immediately below the slide you clicked.
 
Of course, if you need to edit a slide, select it in the slide pane first to make it 
appear in the slide design area.
 
 This simple idea can save you time: If you’ve worked hard on a slide and 
intend to use some of the same elements (caption, image, or text) in the fol-
lowing slide, click the Duplicate Slide button on the Toolbar, choose 
Duplicate Slide from the right-click menu or select Delete Slide from the Slide 
menu. Then you can edit and change just a few elements, leaving the rest of 
the slide intact.
Using the File Menu to Full Advantage
One of the most important tools in Google Presentations likes to hang out 
inconspicuously in the top-left corner of the screen. Don’t underestimate its 
power, though. While you create your presentations, you absolutely need to 
understand the Presentations File menu.
The File menu allows you to do many tasks, such as creating a new file; open-
ing a file; uploading or importing a presentation; saving, printing, renaming, 
and deleting a presentation;.

310
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Renaming a presentation
 
You may initially be stuck with a name like “Untitled Presentation.” To 
rename a presentation, click the File menu and choose Rename from the 
menu. Alternatively, you can click the title itself to rename the presentation. 
A dialog box opens and you can type a new presentation name in the textbox 
that appears.
A warning about scripted dialog boxes may appear in your browser when 
you try to rename a file — just click the warning bar and choose Temporarily 
Allow Scripted Windows from the menu that appears. The browser then 
allows the dialog box to appear when you choose File➪Rename again; 
rename your presentation by typing a new name in the textbox that appears.
Printing the show
You can easily print a copy of your presentation. Click the File menu and 
choose Print from the menu that appears or press Ctrl+P. Presentations then 
prepares the presentation for printing in the window that appears, as shown 
in Figure 17-6. Click the down arrow below the Layout label in the top-right 
corner, and from the pull-down menu choose the number of slides you want 
to appear on each printed page.
You also have the option to print your speaker notes if you choose. (The 
speaker notes check box is shown in Figure 17-6.) However, if you choose this 
option, you’re limited to one slide per page.

Click the Print button and your slideshow is converted to a PDF file for print-
ing purposes. When you’re ready to print your PDF copy of your presenta-
tion, click the PDF print command.
 
You can click the Save as PDF button to save a PDF version. These can be 
printed as handouts or uploaded and saved in your Docs Home. (See the next 
section.)
Saving a PDF copy of your presentation
You can save a PDF copy of a presentation on your hard drive or USB flash 
drive in case you ever need a backup. This is particularly handy if you’re 
presenting from a computer that doesn’t have an Internet connection. To do 
this, click the File menu, choose Download Presentation As and then pick 
PDF from the menu that appears. By choosing this command, you can save a 
small, compressed copy of your presentation.
If you have Adobe Reader installed (you can download it at http://www.
adobe.com/reader), the PDF may appear directly in your browser window. 
Click the Save button on the Reader toolbar to show a dialog box and choose 
where you want to save your file. Otherwise, a dialog box appears directly 
in your browser, asking whether you want to open or save your file. Click 
the Save button, and browse to a location on your hard drive or USB flash 
drive to save the File. After you save the file, you can open it later with Adobe 
Reader to view it.
 
To present your PDF slideshow, open your PDF file in Adobe Reader, and then 
choose File➪Full Screen Mode, or press Ctrl+L (Windows) or Ô+L (Mac). Use 
the arrow keys on your keyboard to move forward and backward.
Uploading existing PowerPoint 
presentations
You may have a few PowerPoint presentations on your desktop computer 
that you want to convert into the Google Presentations format and then save 
online. In fact, you may want to preserve a copy of all your PowerPoint pre-
sentations on Google servers so that you don’t lose all your hard work if a 
computer crashes. To upload a PowerPoint presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File menu and choose Upload a Presentation from the menu.
 
 When the Upload a File screen appears, you can see the limitations on 
your PowerPoint uploads. For example, your uploaded presentation 
can’t exceed 10MB.

312
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
2. Click the Browse button to locate your PowerPoint presentation. (You 
can also convert other open source presentations.)
 
3. (Optional) If you want to rename the PowerPoint presentation, click 
the What Do You Want to Call It textbox and type a new name.
 
4. Click the Upload File button.
Integrating other slides into a show
When you create a slideshow, you may want to insert a slide, or series of 
slides, that you already created for another presentation. You can integrate 
both PowerPoint and Google Presentations slides. To integrate individual 
slides from another file, click the File button and choose Import Slides from 
the menu that appears. The Import Slides dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 17-7. In this dialog box, just follow the steps — the first step asks you 
to choose the presentation from which you want to import slides.
Thumbnails of the slides from the presentation that you choose appear in the 
Import Slides dialog box. You can then select the check box to the left of each 
slide that you want to integrate into your presentation. The slides that you 
select are copied into your existing presentation. As soon as you select the 
slides you want, click the Import button; the dialog box closes.
 
You may need to move the newly integrated slides up or down to place them 
in the order that you want, as we explain in the section “Organizing Slides,” 
earlier in this chapter. Right-click any thumbnail in the slide pane and choose 
Move Slide Up or Move Slide Down, as needed.

Viewing Revisions
What if you make a mistake or add too many slides and you need to retreat 
to an earlier version of your presentation? Like with Docs and Spreadsheets, 
Presentations tracks every change that you and your collaborators make to 
your presentation by selecting the File menu and picking Revision History. 
The revision screen looks like Figure 17-8.
You can always revert to an earlier version by clicking a Revision # link on 
the left side of the Revisions tab. A preview of the older version appears in 
the Presentations window. If you want to use that version, click the Revert to 
This Version button.

Giving Your Presentation
Google Presentations gives you two great ways to present your slideshow. 
First, you can display your presentation from any computer in the tradi-
tional way — by projecting it to an audience in a meeting room, classroom, 
or auditorium. This is a great way to present to a group of people gathered 
in a room. Second, you can give your presentation on the Web and let other 
remote participants follow along on their computers and interact with you in 
a group chat. This is an excellent way to share your ideas with people in dif-
ferent locations or around the world.
Projecting your slideshow
To begin a large group presentation, first make sure that you have an 
Internet-enabled computer that is connected to a projector. Then log 
into your Google Apps account, open your slideshow, and click the Start 
Presentation link in the header at the top of the screen, or press Ctrl+F5 on 
your keyboard.

314
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Your presentation loads into a new browser window that fills up the screen. 
However, you probably still see the window border. To hide the window and 
see your presentation full screen, press the F11 key on your keyboard if you 
are using Internet Explorer (IE) or Firefox. If you are using Chrome, click the 
Maximize button. For IE and Firefox users, when you finish viewing your pre-
sentation, press F11 again to restore your browser window. Don’t worry; if 
you forget about the F11 key, Google Presentations shows a temporary, trans-
parent box at the top of your screen when you first start your presentation to 
remind you about it.
You’ll also notice the Audience panel that appears on the right side of the 
presentation. We talk more about the Audience panel in the “Discussing the 
presentation with your audience” section, later in this chapter. To hide that 
panel, simply click anywhere along the left edge of the panel (look for the 
little arrow), as shown in Figure 17-9.
To move from slide to slide, either forward or backward, click one of the 
arrows in the bottom-left corner of the presentation screen. These arrows 
appear in a transparent box, so you need to scroll over them to make them 
fully visible. You can also use your arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, or the 
spacebar to advance slides.
 
If you use Internet Explorer, you can exit full-screen mode by pressing either F11 
or Esc. You can also move your mouse to the top-right corner of the screen; the 
Close button appears. Click the Close button to end the presentation.

Inviting collaborators and viewers
Use the Share tab to invite people as either collaborators or viewers. (See 
Chapter 15 for more details.) Collaborators can not only co-present with you, 
but also make changes to the presentation itself. Moreover, viewers don’t 
have to participate in your presentation to flip through the slides on their 
own time.
Start inviting people by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Share button and pick Share with Others.
 
2. Select the As Collaborators radio button to allow the people you invite 
to edit your presentation; select the As Viewers radio button to allow 
the people you invite to only view the presentation.
 
3. Click the Invite People textbox and enter the e-mail addresses of the 
people you want to invite, as shown in Figure 17-10.
 
 You can further increase the security of your presentation by not select-
ing the Advanced Permissions check boxes.
 
4. When you finish specifying your security settings, click the Invite 
Collaborators (or Invite Viewers) button.
 
 An e-mail invitation screen appears, letting you send an e-mail message 
to your collaborators or viewers. This e-mail provides its recipients with 
a link to access the presentation.

If you need to send additional e-mail updates concerning your presentation, 
click the Share tab and click the Email Collaborators link. The Email 
Collaborators window appears and lets you write a message to your team. You 
can also create Calendar events by clicking the Create Event with 
Collaborators link and filling in the details on the Events Details window that 
appears. If you need to add or delete collaborators, you can do that from the 
Share tab, as well, by clicking the X to the right of each contact’s name.
Leading an Online Web presentation
One of the great advantages of Google Presentations is that you don’t have 
to present your slideshows face to face with your audience. With Web 
presentations, you can invite others to follow along with your presentation 
while you chat about it directly in your presentation, talk about it with 
Google Talk, or have a conference call on Skype (check out http://www.
skype.com to find more).
To start a Web presentation, you must first send each member of your audi-
ence a link to your presentation. After they have this link, they can view the 
presentation, print slides, and participate in group chat. Here’s the easiest 
way to create an audience:
 
1. Log into Google Docs, open your presentation file, and then click the 
Share button in the top-right corner of the screen and pick Share with 
Others.
 
 A screen similar to Figure 17-10 appears.
 
2. Click inside the textbox below Invite People on the left side of the 
screen, and enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to join 
your presentation.
 
3. Select the radio button to the left of As Viewers and then click the 
Invite Viewers button. Alternately, to add co-presenters, repeat these 
steps, select the radio button to the left of As Collaborators, and then 
click the Invite Collaborators button.
 
 The Email Presentation window appears. If you enter e-mail addresses 
for participants that are outside of your domain, you’ll see a dialog box 
asking you to confirm that you want to invite them. Click OK to load the 
Email Presentation window.
 
4. Compose an e-mail message in the textboxes that appear with a short 
message and details about your presentation and then click the Send 
button to return to your Share screen.
 
 Your message is sent to your participants along with a link to view your 
presentation. In the message, you may want to include the specific date 
and time when you will discuss your presentation online. Also, participants 
should have a Google Account or create one to be able to participate.

317
 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
 
5. (Optional) In the bottom-right corner of the Share screen, click the 
Create Event with Viewers link to create a Calendar event with your 
viewers.
 
 On the new Event Details window that appears, enter the date and time 
for when you want to meet and click Save Changes. You may be warned 
about sending an invitation outside your domain (click OK). If you want 
to send an e-mail invitation, click Send. When you finish creating your 
invitation, close the Event Details window. Note: The event will include a 
link to your presentation as well.
 
6. Click the Back to Editor link to return to your presentation. 
When you’re ready to start your Web presentation, click the Start 
Presentation link at the top of the screen, or press Ctrl+F5.
When you start a Web presentation online, you’re initially in control. Each 
member in your audience who has opened your presentation appears in a 
list in the Audience panel. You can deliver the presentation to your audience 
slide by slide, just as you would to an audience in an auditorium. When you 
click the Forward or Back button, your audience sees the slides in the order 
that you present them, as shown in Figure 17-11.
 
Figure 17-11: 
Audience 
members 
can go at 
their pace 
or follow the 
presenter.
 

318
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
Audience members can choose to stop following you and flip through slides at 
their own pace on their screens by clicking the left and right arrows on their 
screen. When doing this, they see a small slide in the top-right corner of their 
screen that reflects your current position. To start following you again, they 
click the Follow the Presenter link,.
To add any latecomers to your presentation who weren’t invited previously, 
copy the presentation address that appears in the textbox in the top-right 
corner of the Audience panel (see Figure 17-12) or the link along the bottom 
of the screen. Paste it into Google Talk, Gmail, Chat or an e-mail message and 
then send it to your contacts. These contacts must be users in your domain 
to join immediately; otherwise, you must add them as viewers (as described 
in the preceding steps).
Discussing the presentation 
with your audience
The Audience panel has similar features to Google Talk (see Chapter 20). You 
can discuss your presentation with your participants while you collectively 
view the presentation. This panel can serve another purpose: Your collabo-
rators can chat about the presentation collectively and hammer out details 
while you all make changes. (See Figure 17-12.)
When new people join your presentation, they appear in your Audience list, 
as shown in Figure 17-12. You can track the names of who’s coming and going 
with a quick glance at your Audience panel.
 
Participants can also print hard copies of the slides in your presentation by 
clicking the Print Slides link in the bottom-right corner of the presentation. 
(See the section, “Printing the Show,” earlier in this chapter for more details.)

319
 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
Relinquishing control
You can hand the presentation off to a co-presenter by clicking the Stop 
Presenting link at the top of the Audience panel. Another presenter (whom 
you invite as a collaborator, as described in the section, “Giving Your 
Presentation,” earlier in this chapter) can then take over the presentation 
by clicking the Take Control of Presentation button that appears in the 
Audience panel. 
 
If you’re participating in a presentation and think that the current presenter is 
going too fast or too slow, you can always click back and forward through the 
presentation at your own pace.
Sharing and Publishing a Presentation
As with Documents and Spreadsheets, Google Presentations allows you to 
collaborate with other team members or contacts on your presentation with-
out having to e-mail files back and forth and worry about having too many 
versions of the same slideshow. (See Chapter 15 for more details on sharing 
and collaboration.) 
In this section, we cover how to e-mail your presentation link to other users, 
set up collaborators, and finally, publish your presentation to a Web page so 
anyone can view it.
E-mail a presentation
You can easily share a presentation by e-mailing your audience a link to it. If 
you want to send the presentation to others, click the Email link under the 
Share button. A simple e-mail form appears, as shown in Figure 17-13. Click 
the Subject textbox and type a subject, and then click the Message textbox 
and type a message (we like to keep it short and sweet). Click Send. (You may 
want to Cc yourself by selecting the CC Me check box below the message.)
The e-mail message that your friend, family member, or colleague receives 
includes a link to the actual presentation itself. Remember that you’re shar-
ing only one copy of the presentation with however many people need it (sin-
gledocumindedness). After your contact receives the e-mail, he can view the 
entire presentation — and even make changes if you give him collaborative 
rights, which we discuss in the previous section. The presentation appears in 
his Docs Home list.

Nervous? Add speaker notes
 
 Speaker notes can help you stay on target with your message while you pres-
ent. Notes can keep you from forgetting what you want to say, and they can 
be added easily. Adding speaker notes is as easy as clicking the Speaker 
Notes button when you prepare your presentation and entering the text you 
want to appear to remind you of what you want to say. (See Figure 17-14).
After you start your presentation, which we discuss in the next section, 
you can simply click the Speaker Notes button again. Doing so opens your 
speaker notes window so you can remember exactly what you want to say at 
the precise time you need to say it.

 Chapter 17: Creating Amazing Google Presentations
Publishing a presentation
You can publish a presentation online with two or three simple clicks. Click 
the Share tab and then click the Publish and Embed option.
After a few seconds, the URL (Web address) of the published presentation 
appears on the screen. You can copy the URL and send it to anyone who 
you want to see your presentation. Additionally, the option to embed a mini 
player that presents your slideshow on a Web page appears. (See Figure 
17-15.) Copy the code in the textbox on the left and paste it into a Web page 
you’ve created to have your presentation appear.
 
If you want to limit publication to just the members of your Google Apps 
domain, select the Viewers Must Sign In with a <YourDomainName> Account 
to View the Published Document check box.

Using Google Calendar
In This Chapter

▶ Adjusting your calendar views and using multiple calendars
▶ Searching for events
▶ Scheduling events and inviting guests
▶ Changing calendar settings
▶ Accessing a calendar on the Web and on mobile devices
I
t seems that every time we become more efficient, we quickly find some-
thing else to fill the extra time. While Google Calendar can’t help us with 
our type A personalities, it can help us organize our time and manage our 
daily events — whether it’s a Little League game, a proposal for an important 
meeting, or a well-deserved power nap.
Google Calendar is extremely useful because it’s online. In fact, you can 
access Calendar from virtually any device with an Internet or SMS connec-
tion. With a few taps or clicks, you can view your agenda on your iPhone, 
schedule a meeting on your PC, and share a calendar with a colleague from 
an Internet café in Mumbai.
Using Calendar
You can set up your calendar (or multiple calendars) in a snap. (See Figure 
18-1.) To do so, you need the prerequisite username and password. If you’re 
a Google Apps user, you may need to authenticate your account.
 
The first time you log into Google Calendar, you’re asked to set your time 
zone. Establishing your time zone helps you coordinate schedules with col-
leagues in different time zones. (You can change the time zone later by click-
ing the Settings link at the top of your calendar screen.)

324
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
Figure 18-1: 
Use Google 
Calendar to 
keep on top 
of your day.
 
You can access Google Calendar in two ways:
 
✓ Open Google Calendar from a Start Page or Sites Page gadget: Open 
your start page or Sites page. Look for a Calendar gadget, like the one 
shown in Figure 18-2. (You can use this gadget to view your upcoming 
appointments quickly.) Click the Google Calendar link in the title bar of 
the gadget to open your full calendar.
 
✓ Go directly to Google Calendar: You can log into your Google Calendar 
directly at http://calendar.google.com. Access team or Apps 
calendars by typing calendar and the domain name of your organization 
in the address bar of your Web browser — http://calendar.
ardsleybooks.com, for example. Team Edition users should go to 
http://calendar.google.com/a/yourdomain.com.
Creating and changing events
The most important Google Calendar procedure to know is how to add and 
change events. A blank calendar, after all, isn’t very useful. You have multiple 
ways to add events easily to your calendar:
 
✓ Quick Add: Click the Quick Add link or press Q, and then simply click 
the textbox that appears and type your event details. For example, you 
can enter something like, “Brunch with Cal 11am Wednesday.” It even 
creates recurring events, such as “Carpool with John 6:30am every 
Tuesday and Thursday.”

325
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
 
✓ Highlight a time: Using your mouse, click and drag to highlight a block 
of time. A white speech bubble appears. Click the What textbox, type 
your event, and then click the Create Event button.
 
 If you want to add more event details, such as notes, locations, recurring 
options, or to add guests, click the Edit Event Details link rather than the 
Create Event button. Doing so takes you to the Event Details screen, as 
shown in Figure 18-3.
 
✓ Create Event: Click the Create Event link or press C to specify additional 
event details. On the Event Details screen that appears, you can choose 
What, When, Where, and add a Description, as shown in Figure 18-3.
 
Figure 18-2: 
Use a 
gadget to 
launch and 
track your 
calendar.
 
 
Figure 18-3: 
Specify the 
particulars 
of an event.
 
 
 Here are some hints for entering event details:
 
• What: Enter a brief description of the event in the What textbox. Is 
it a meeting? A softball game? A trip to the stylist?

326
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
• When: Click the When or To textboxes to make a popup calen-
dar appear. This calendar helps you pinpoint the day on which 
an event begins or ends. When you click the time textboxes, a 
drop-down list featuring the time of day in half-hour increments 
appears. Selecting the All Day check box makes the event appear 
at the top of that particular day on your daily or weekly calendar.
 
• Repeats: From this drop-down list, choose whether you want your 
event to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Additionally, 
depending on what option you select, more options appear so that 
you can choose how long you want the event to repeat.
 
• Where: Enter a description of where the event takes place. If you 
enter a street address, the next time you look at your event, a Map 
link appears in the event speech bubble or in the Event Details 
screen. Clicking that link loads the address in Google Maps, which 
opens in a new window.
 
• Calendar: By default, events that you enter go to your main cal-
endar (the one titled with your name). When you add multiple 
calendars, a Calendar drop-down list appears and you can choose 
to add the event to a different calendar by choosing that calendar 
from the list.
 
• Description: Add details, such as directions to an event, who you’re 
meeting, what you need to bring, or your goals for a meeting.
 
 When you finish entering the event’s details, click the Save button to 
save the event and place it in your calendar.
 
✓ Receive an invitation: If another Google Calendar user invites you to 
a meeting, that meeting appears automatically on your calendar with 
a question mark in the corner. Click the event to see the event bubble. 
You can tell the event host whether you can attend or not by clicking 
the Yes, No, or Maybe links. The event host receives your response 
automatically when you click one of these links. Declined events appear 
faded out in your calendar.
 
✓ Add an event in Gmail: If someone sends you an e-mail with some dates 
and times, Gmail asks whether you want to add the events discussed 
in the e-mail to your calendar. To add the events to your calendar from 
Gmail, click the Add to Calendar link that appears to the right of your 
e-mail message.
Moving your events around
The only constant in life is change. Fortunately, making changes is easy in 
Google Calendar. When your meeting is rescheduled, you can change the 
event in your calendar in these ways:

327
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
 
✓ To change the time of an event: Simply click the shaded area of the 
event and drag it to the new time slot.
 
✓ To extend or shorten an event: Click and drag the double white lines 
along the bottom edge downward to extend the event, or drag upward 
to shorten the event.
 
✓ To make more specific changes to an event: Click the event and click 
the Edit Event Details link in the speech bubble that appears.
 
If you change an event that you didn’t create (such as a lunch your supervisor 
invited you to), the event doesn’t change in the host’s calendar. Make sure 
that you call or e-mail your host so he or she can change the event in his or 
her calendar, too.
Deleting events
To delete an event, simply click an event, and then click the Delete link in 
the speech bubble that appears. Also, if you double-click an event, the Event 
Details screen appears, and you can click the Delete button at the top of that 
screen to delete that appointment.
Setting Up Calendar Notifications
Google Calendar can send you a reminder before an event. Depending on how 
you set your notifications, Google Calendar shows you a popup reminder, 
sends a text message to your mobile phone, or sends you a friendly e-mail.
 
To see popup reminders, you must have a browser window open and Google 
Calendar loaded. To receive text messages, you must register your mobile 
phone (which we tell you how to do in the “Registering your mobile phone to 
receive notifications” section, later in this chapter).
Creating universal event reminders
By default, your primary calendar displays a popup window ten minutes 
prior to every event you create. Changing this setting is as easy as pie. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. To change your notifications, click the arrow to the right of a cal-
endar (from the list on the left side of the screen), and then choose 
Notifications from the drop-down list that appears.
 
 The Notifications tab appears, as shown in Figure 18-4.

328
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
Figure 18-4: 
Set default 
remind-
ers and 
configure 
your mobile 
phone.
 
 
2. In the Event Reminders section of the Notifications tab, choose Pop-
Up, Email, or SMS (text message) from the By Default, Remind Me 
Via drop-down list. Choose how soon before each event you want to 
receive the reminder from the Before Each Event drop-down list.
 
 If SMS doesn’t appear in the By Default, Remind Me Via drop-down list 
and you want to receive reminders on your mobile phone, follow the 
steps in the next section to register your mobile phone with Google 
Calendar, and then return to these steps.
 
3. Click the Add Another Reminder link to add up to five notifications.
 
4. In the Choose How You Would Like to Be Notified section, select the 
check box in the Email or SMS column (depending on which method 
you prefer).
 
 For example, select the check box in the Email column to the right of 
New Invitations to receive an e-mail notification when someone sends 
you an invitation to an event.
 
5. To disable a notification, click the Remove link to the right of the 
reminder.
 
6. When you’re happy with your settings, click the Save button to return 
to your calendar.
Registering your mobile phone 
to receive notifications
Before your mobile phone can receive notifications from your calendar, you 
must first register your phone with Google Calendar by following these steps:

329
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
 
1. From the Notifications screen, click the Set Up Your Mobile Phone to 
Receive Notifications link.
 
 Alternatively, from your main calendar, click the Settings link at the top 
of the page, and then click the Mobile Setup tab. The Mobile Setup tab 
appears, as shown in Figure 18-5.
 
Figure 18-5: 
Register 
your phone 
to enable 
SMS sched-
uling.
 
 
2. Choose your country from the Country drop-down list.
 
3. Click the Phone Number textbox and enter your mobile phone 
number.
 
 It doesn’t matter what format you enter your number in. 555-555-1212 
will work the same as (555) 555-1212 or 5555551212.
 
4. Choose your carrier from the Carrier drop-down list.
 
 If your carrier doesn’t appear in the Carrier drop-down list, click the 
What Carriers Are Supported? link. If you’re trying to connect from 
outside of the United States and the Carrier drop-down list doesn’t 
appear, click the See Help Center for Supported Providers link. A list 
of the supported carriers worldwide opens in a new window. If your 
provider appears on the Help Center page and is supported, return to 
your calendar notification settings, leave the Carrier field blank, and 
continue to Step 5.
 
5. Click the Send Verification Code button.
 
 A text message appears on your phone within a few minutes.
 
6. Click the Verification Code textbox, type the code that you receive in 
your phone’s text message, and then click the Finish Setup button.
 
Although SMS notifications are free from Google, your mobile carrier may 
charge you for each text message that you send or receive. Be sure to check 
your phone’s plan before you use SMS reminders extensively.

330
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Adding reminders to individual events
You can easily set reminders for individual events. Follow these steps to 
make sure that you don’t miss that important meeting or softball game:
 
1. Click an event that you want to add a reminder to and then click the 
Edit Event Details or More Details link at the bottom of the speech 
bubble that appears.
 
 The Event Details screen appears.
 
2. In the Options pane on the right of the Event Details screen, click the 
Add a Reminder link to add up to five different notifications.
 
3. Use the drop-down lists to choose what type of notification you want 
and when.
 
 For example, to receive an e-mail reminder an hour before the event, 
choose Email from the left drop-down list and 1 Hour from the right 
drop-down list.
 
4. Click the Remove link to disable a notification.
 
 The event reminder disappears right away, and you have to rely on your 
memory.
 
5. Click the Save button to save your changes and return to your calendar.
Changing Your Calendar Views
Google Calendar lets you change how you view your schedule — just click the 
blue tabs in the top-right corner of your screen. Here are the basic calendar 
views:
 
✓ Day: Click the Day tab or press D to view your appointments for a given 
day, starting with the next upcoming event.
 
✓ Week: Click the Week tab or press W to see a full week’s worth of 
events. All day events appear at the top of the calendar.
 
 You can customize your Week view to start on a day other than Sunday 
or to hide weekends. Click the Settings link in the top left of the screen, 
click the arrows to the right of Week Starts On and Show Weekends, and 
then choose the options you want from the drop-down lists that appear. 
Scroll to the bottom of the Settings screen and click Save to return to 
your calendar.
 
✓ Month: Click the Month tab or press M to see your month at a glance.

331
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
 
✓ Next 4 Days: Click the Next 4 Days tab or press X to see this custom 
view. To change the time period, click the Settings link at the top of 
the screen and locate the Custom View section (it’s halfway down the 
Settings screen). Click the arrow to the right of the drop-down list in the 
Custom View section and choose your favorite custom time frame, from 
Next 2 Days to Next 4 Weeks.
 
✓ Agenda: Click the Agenda tab or press A to see your agenda. The 
agenda is handy because it lists all the calendar items in a condensed, 
easy-to-read format. When you click any event, it expands to show you 
the details.
 
You don’t have to be limited to the options in the preceding list. You can view 
any number of days, from one day to seven weeks, by highlighting the days on 
the mini calendar on the left of any calendar screen.
After you find a view that you like, use the arrows at the top left to move for-
ward and backward in increments of that time period. You can also press N 
to move forward and P to move backward. To return to the current day, click 
the Today button or press T.
Printing Your Calendar
You can print a copy of any calendar view. You can also save your calendar 
to a PDF file that you can send to others. Simply select your preferred calen-
dar view (see the preceding section for details), and then click the Print link 
to the left of the tabs. The Calendar Print Preview window appears, as shown 
in Figure 18-6.
In the Calendar Print Preview window, you can adjust the font size by clicking 
the arrow to the right of Font Size and choosing a size from the drop-down 
list. Choose which direction you want the calendar to print by clicking the 
arrow to the right of Orientation and choosing a direction from the drop-
down list. Print the calendar in black and white by selecting the Black & 
White check box. To print in color, make sure the Black & White check box 
is deselected. Click the Print button to complete printing. Click the Save As 
button to download a PDF version to your desktop.
 
To print a blank calendar, return to your calendar screen and click the name 
of each of your calendars in the My Calendars list so they are no longer high-
lighted, and then click the Print link. When you finish, click the names of your 
calendars again to make your events reappear.

Using Multiple Calendars
In the following sections, we show you how to create multiple calendars (for 
example, one for work, one for your bowling league, and one for your week-
end adventures). We also cover how you can add public calendars, such as 
sports schedules, daily closing stock prices, and holidays. Put all your cares 
on Google Calendar so you can spend less time remembering appointments 
and more time doing the stuff you love.
Adding calendars
First things first — check out the Add link at the bottom of the My Calendars 
list. Using the options in this menu, you can add public calendars, import 
events, and more. Here’s what each option in the Add menu does:

333
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
 
✓ Add a public calendar: Select this option to explore calendars that 
others have made, including calendars announcing holidays, your alma 
mater’s football game schedule, or important stock quotes. When you 
click this option, you see a screen that lets you browse the most popu-
lar public calendars. You can also use the search box at the top of the 
Calendar gallery screen to search any hundreds of others. To add a 
public calendar, simply click the Add to Calendar button. The Calendar 
gallery is similar to the Gadget gallery that we discuss in Chapter 6.
 
 To follow stocks, enter the ticker symbol of your favorite company in 
the Search textbox at the top of the Calendar gallery screen and then 
click the Search Public Calendars button. Look for the Google Finance 
calendar for the company you want and click Add to Calendar. Each 
day’s closing price appears at the top of each day on your calendar.
 
✓ Add a friend’s calendar: Co-workers who use Google Calendar have 
shared calendars by default. To show a friend’s or colleague’s calen-
dar alongside your calendar, first click this option and then enter your 
contact’s e-mail address in the textbox on the screen that appears. 
Finally, click the Add button to the right of the textbox and your con-
tact’s shared calendar appears automatically. If she doesn’t have Google 
Calendar, you can invite her to create one.
 
✓ Add by URL: When you come across a Web site that has a calendar feed 
that you want to add to your Google Calendar, copy the URL, and then 
return to your calendar. Click the Add menu in the My Calendars list on 
the left-hand side of the screen, select Add by URL, and in the screen 
that appears, paste the URL into the Public Calendar Address textbox. 
Don’t forget to click the Add button when you finish.
 
✓ Import Calendar: Use this tool to add events from another calendar 
program, such as Outlook or iCal.
To create a new calendar, click the Create link below your calendars. Use this 
link to create a separate calendar for your bowling league, child’s soccer sched-
ule, or other events that you don’t want to appear on your main calendar.
Changing colors and settings
Whether you have only a few calendars or a plethora, you can easily manage 
them from the My Calendars list. To hide calendar events tied to a specific 
calendar, uncheck the box to the left of each calendar name. Check the box 
again when you want to show that calendar. You may find hiding calendars 
particularly handy if your calendar is bursting with events.

334
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
In addition to selecting or deselecting the calendars’ check boxes, click-
ing the down arrow to the right of a calendar gives you some more options 
including specifying colors for that calendar:
 
✓ Display Only This Calendar: Selecting this option shows only the events 
on a single calendar on your main calendar screen. Other calendars and 
events disappear from your main calendar screen until you check each 
calendar’s check box again.
 
✓ Hide This Calendar from the List: This only appears on additional cal-
endars. Selecting this option makes the calendar disappear from the list. 
Click the Settings link at the bottom of the My Calendars list for options 
to reveal, hide, and delete your calendars.
 
✓ Calendar Settings: Selecting this option opens the Calendar Details 
screen. You can change the calendar name and description, and see the 
calendar address. In the Calendar Details tab, you can also access the 
tool that you can use to embed your calendar on a Web page.
 
✓ Create Event on This Calendar: Selecting this option does the same 
thing as clicking the Create Event link at the top of the main Calendar 
screen, except it automatically assigns the event to the specific calen-
dar. (When you have multiple calendars and click the Create Event link, 
you can specify on which calendar you want to create your event by 
choosing from the Calendar drop-down list on the Create Event screen.)
 
✓ Share This Calendar: Selecting this option shows the Calendar Details 
screen, where you can choose how much information you want to share 
for each calendar. 
 
✓ Notifications: New calendars don’t have notifications by default, but you 
can change those settings by selecting Notifications and choosing your 
options on the Calendar Details screen. (See the section “Setting Up 
Calendar Notifications,” earlier in this chapter, for details.)
 
✓ Color: Clicking a color box changes all the events associated with that 
calendar to the selected color. In addition to being visually appealing, 
choosing different colors for different calendars can help you tell at 
a glance what’s going on with multiple calendars and if you have any 
scheduling conflicts.
Feel free to adjust these settings until you find a calendar that makes you 
smile. For more control over these settings, click the Settings link at the 
bottom of the My Calendars list.
 
Be careful not to click the trashcan icon on the Calendars screen (click the 
Settings link to go to the Calendars screen) unless you’re certain that you 
want to delete a calendar. You can add public calendars again, but if you 
delete one of your main calendars without sharing it with someone first, you 
have no way to get it back.

 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
Searching Your Calendar
Search is one of our favorite features in Google Calendar. Sometimes, you 
may forget an event. You may even forget on which calendar the event is 
located. No problem. Click the Search box at the top of your Calendar screen 
or press / (the forward slash key); type a few words about the event, such as 
lunch; then click the Search My Calendars button. A list of all the lunches on 
your calendars appears, as shown in Figure 18-7. Type in even more informa-
tion and you can find more specific events. Click the Search My Calendars 
button to see results from all your calendars.
 
Figure 18-7: 
You can find 
events 
easily 
by using 
Google 
Search.
 
Your search results appear in a new tab at the top, so you can switch 
between your normal calendar views and compare results. In your search 
results, click the date to the left of an event to see that day’s agenda. Click 
the event time or name to see and edit the event’s details.
 
You can also use the Search box to find public calendars at any time, as dis-
cussed in the earlier “Adding calendars” section.
 
You can usually use the Search box at the top of your Calendar screen to find 
the event that you can’t remember. Suppose, however, that you want to see 
only meetings with your colleague, Janice, in a certain time period, and you 
can’t remember any of the meeting specifics. Google has the answer. The 
Show Search Options link appears (in tiny type) to the right of the Search box. 
Click that link to reveal more specific search boxes, as shown in Figure 18-8. 
You can add details, such as a date range, that narrow the search results. 
Click the Search button, and your results appear.

and return to the basic calendar screen.
Sharing Invitations with Others
Although it can’t add an extra hour to every day, Google Calendar can be a 
huge timesaver for organizations, schools, businesses, and families. You can 
send meeting and event invitations, and track people’s responses, even if 
they use other calendar programs.
Now, families can keep track of those family reunions, and parents can coor-
dinate their kids’ schedules from home or work. Salespeople can track leads 
and follow up with their customers. Schools can let teachers book time in 
the library, share a mobile computer lab, or work with parents to help their 
students. And don’t forget about college students — they can follow a class 
schedule and book time with their study group by using the campus-wide 
Google Calendar.
Creating invitations
You can easily send invitations to any kind of event, whether it’s a business 
meeting or poker night. Anyone can receive your invitations, even if they 
don’t use Google Calendar or don’t have a Google Account.

337
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
Sending event invitations is a breeze; just follow these steps:
 
1. To invite guests to a new event, click the Create Event link on the 
main Calendar screen; to invite guests to an event that already exists 
on your calendar, click the event to reveal its speech bubble and then 
click the Edit Event Details link.
 
 On the Event Details screen, look for the Guests pane.
 
2. In the Guests pane’s textbox, enter the e-mail addresses of people 
that you want to invite to your event. Separate each address with a 
comma.
 
 You can also click the Choose from Contacts link to select guests from 
your Contacts list.
 
3. Select the check boxes in the Guests Can section if you want to allow 
guests to invite others and see the guest list.
 
4. When you finish adding your guests, click the Save button at the top 
of the Event Details screen.
 
 The Send Update dialog box appears, giving you the option to send an 
e-mail to invite your guests.
 
5. Click the Send button to send the invitation or the Don’t Send button 
to save your event without notifying your guests.
 
 Each of your guests promptly receives an e-mail message that asks him 
whether he plans to attend. Those guests who use Google Calendar see 
the event appear automatically on their calendars with a question mark 
in the event’s top-right corner. Guests who use Outlook can respond 
directly from the e-mail, and the event appears automatically on their 
Outlook calendar, as well.
Responding to invitations
You (or your guests) can respond to invitations in one of two ways. First, you 
can click a link in the e-mail that you receive. Simply click the link that says 
Yes, No, or Maybe, and the host’s event is updated to indicate your response.
Alternatively, you can respond directly from Google Calendar by clicking 
an event that shows a question mark in the top-right corner, and then click-
ing Yes, No, or Maybe in the event bubble that appears. If you click Yes, the 
question mark disappears. If you click No, the event becomes faded out and 
the question mark disappears. If you click Maybe, the question mark remains, 
but your host will know that you’re considering attending. You can always 
change your response later by clicking the event again.

338
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Checking guest status 
and e-mailing guests
When your event draws near, you may want to see how many people are 
planning to attend. You can check the status of your guests’ responses by 
double-clicking the event, as shown in Figure 18-9.
 
Figure 18-9: 
View who 
plans to 
attend in 
the event’s 
details.
 
If you decide to change event details later in the Event Details screen, click 
Save; a dialog box appears, asking whether you want to notify the guests 
about the change. To get in touch with your guests at any time, click the 
Email Guests link in the Guests pane to send a quick message. An e-mail 
window appears, similar to Figure 18-10. Don’t forget to select the Send a 
Copy to Myself check box if you want to receive a copy of the message.
Sending invitations directly from Gmail
Gmail likes to help you play the part of super scheduler, too. Click the Add 
Event Info link just below the subject line in the Compose Message window. 
In the expanded event info area, enter the details for an event, as shown in 
Figure 18-11. The event is automatically added to your Calendar!

Making a Calendar Available to Others
You can share your calendar with your friends, your soccer team, your 
family, and your colleagues. When you share with others, you see each oth-
er’s calendars side by side. By default, your main calendar can be accessed 
by other Google Apps users in your organization (or Internet domain), but no 
one outside of it. In the following sections, we cover how to adjust your shar-
ing settings and make your calendar private, if you want.

340
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Sharing options
For each calendar that you manage, you can select how you want to share 
your events with others. To change these settings, click the down arrow 
to the right of a calendar in the My Calendars list and choose Share This 
Calendar from the drop-down list that appears. The Events Details screen 
appears with the Share This Calendar tab active, similar to Figure 18-12.
 
We think it’s a good idea to create a separate “public” calendar to share with 
others. This way you can keep your personal events on your main calendar 
and share your family reunions, work meetings, and so on, without telling 
people about your doctor appointments.
 
Figure 18-12: 
Choose 
how much 
information 
you want to 
share.
 
Depending on what your administrator chooses, you may or may not be able 
to share details from your main calendar with people outside your organiza-
tion. Be sure to click the Save button after you make any changes.
The Share This Calendar tab has the following areas:
 
✓ Share with Everyone: Choose how much event information you want 
to make publicly available. If you select any option besides the Do Not 
Share with Everyone radio button, anyone can search your calendar.
 
✓ Share with My Domain: Choose how much information you want your 
co-workers or colleagues to see.
 
✓ Share with Specific People: Allow individuals to view and/or manage 
events on your calendar. We cover this section in depth in the section 
that follows.

341
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
For the first two sections in the preceding list, you have the following 
options, which you can change at any time:
 
✓ Do Not Share with Everyone: If you select this radio button, no one 
other than individuals to whom you specifically give permission can 
access your calendar. This is the most private setting.
 
✓ Share All Information on This Calendar with Everyone: Select this 
radio button if you want your co-workers or anyone, in general, to see 
your event details. Although we don’t recommend using this setting to 
share your main calendar outside of your domain, you must select this 
radio button for calendars that you want to post on a Web site.
 
✓ Share Only My Free/Busy Information (Hide Details): Select this radio 
button to allow others to see when you have openings in your schedule 
but not allow them to see event specifics. They see only blocks labeled 
Busy in times you have events scheduled, as shown in Figure 18-13.
 
Figure 18-13: 
Share your 
time without 
giving away 
any details.
 
Sharing with specific people
Not only can you let others see your calendar events, you can give your 
friends and co-workers permission to make changes and add events, as well 
as invite others to join in.
Follow these steps to give a specific person permission to make changes on 
your calendar:

342
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
1. In the My Calendars list, choose Share This Calendar from the 
appropriate calendar’s drop-down list.
 
 The Share This Calendar tab appears (refer to Figure 18-12).
 
2. In the Add a New Person textbox, enter the e-mail address of the 
person with whom you want to share your calendar.
 
 If the e-mail address that you’re adding is one of your contacts, the 
name appears automatically below the textbox while you type.
 
3. From the drop-down list in the Add a New Person section, choose 
what permissions you want to give that person. You can choose one of 
the following options.
 
• Make Changes AND Manage Sharing: Your friend or colleague can 
add, delete, and change events and also allow or deny other people 
access to make changes to your calendar.
 
• Make Changes to Events: Your friend or co-worker can add and 
delete events or make changes to event details on your calendar.
 
• See All Event Details: Other users can see all of your event details 
on your calendar, but can’t make any changes. 
 
• See Free/Busy Information (No Details): Other people can see when 
your events are scheduled, but can’t view event details. Events will 
only read, “Busy.” (Refer to Figure 18-13.)
 
4. Click the Add Person button.
 
 Google Calendar sends an e-mail to that user to let her know that you’ve 
shared a calendar; it also adds your calendar to her Google Calendar 
automatically.
 
5. Repeat the steps for any other people with whom you want to share 
your calendar.
Scheduling Resources
One of the benefits of having a Google Apps account is that Google Calendar 
lets you easily find the best time and place for everyone to meet. When you 
share calendars across your organization, you can view other people’s 
schedules and immediately find the slot that works well for everyone. 
Coordinating schedules has never been so simple. If you’re using Google 
Apps Premier and Education Edition, you can schedule rooms, equipment, 
and other resources — so that end-of-year party can go off without a hitch. 
(Sorry, regular Google Calendar users, you don’t get to work with other 
people’s schedules, so go ahead and ignore this section.)

343
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
When you need to schedule a meeting and you’re not sure what time is 
optimal for everyone, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create Event link.
 
 You see the Event Details screen, where you can add the specifics of 
your meeting or party.
 
2. Click the Check Guest and Resource Availability link.
 
 The Find a Time window appears.
 
3. Add a person to the list of attendees by clicking the textbox below the 
timeline, entering the name or e-mail address of the person that you 
want to attend, and then clicking the Add button.
 
 Every time you click the Add button, each person’s schedule appears 
in the timeline, showing blocks of time that already have events. If your 
organization is using Google Apps Premier or Education Edition, you 
also see a Room Finder section below the timeline. The following section 
explains more about using the Room Finder.
 
 Now you can find a time that’s free for everyone. To move forward or 
backward a time period, click the blue arrow bars to the right or left of 
the timeline, or click and drag the gray bar along the top of the timeline 
left or right.
 
4. Highlight a block of time on the timeline that works best for everyone, 
and then click the OK button in the lower-right corner of the Find a 
Time window.
 
 The thin bar directly below the hours in the schedule shows how heav-
ily people are scheduled. Each busy person at a particular time makes 
the bar darker. If you can’t find a free slot (which appears white in the 
bar), look for light gray striped areas — only one or two people are busy 
at that time. Hover your mouse on a busy guest’s scheduled block to 
see the details of that particular event, and then check with that person 
about the possibility of changing a conflicting appointment.
 
5. On the Event Details screen, enter your additional event details, such 
as a description and reminders, and then click Save.
 
 Just as you see when you add guests (see “Creating invitations” earlier 
in this chapter), a dialog box asks whether you want to send invitations 
to your attendees.
 
6. Click the Send button to send the invitations or the Don’t Send button 
to leave your attendees in the dark (the event will still appear on their 
calendar).

344
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
With Google Apps Premier and Education Edition, you can schedule rooms 
and equipment, such as lecture halls, projectors, or company vehicles. When 
you click the Check Guest and Resource Availability link in the Event Details 
screen, the Find a Time window opens, and the Room Finder section appears 
below the timeline. Use the Filter Room list box to quickly find the room or 
object that you’re looking for. If it’s available, a green box appears to the left of 
the room name. If it’s not available, a red X appears to the left of it, instead. 
Just as you do when you add attendees, select a room from the list and click 
the Add Room button to show the room’s schedule.
Using Calendar on Your Mobile Device
If you don’t have a cellphone, go to your nearest cellphone store and buy 
one. They really are cool. Plus, when you have one, you can access Google 
Calendar events from it or virtually any mobile device. Woohoo!
The following list describes the two ways that you can access your calendar 
on a mobile device (we cover both in more detail in the sections that follow):
 
✓ Google Calendar for Mobile: This method allows you to access a 
feature-rich version of your calendar on an iPhone, BlackBerry, or other 
XHTML-capable phone.
 
✓ Short Messaging Service (SMS): That’s a fancy name for text messag-
ing. Send a text message to Google, and it messages you back with your 
schedule details. This method is perfect for when you’re on the run and 
need to know where you’re heading next.
 
As always, text messaging and mobile phone data plans generally aren’t free. 
Please check with your mobile provider first to see whether you have access 
and can afford it. Don’t blame us if your next cellphone bill rivals your rent or 
mortgage payment.
Using Google Calendar for Mobile
To access Google Calendar for Mobile, open your mobile Web browser and 
enter your direct calendar address (it’s probably similar to the address you 
use to access your normal Google Calendar; for example, http://calendar.
ardleybooks.com). A login screen may appear, asking you to enter your 
username and password. After your calendar loads, a simplified version of it 
appears in Agenda mode, similar to the image on the right of Figure 18-14.

345
 Chapter 18: Using Google Calendar
 
Figure 18-14: 
Access your 
calendar 
from your 
smartphone 
(left) or 
other mobile 
device 
(right).
 
To navigate your calendar, click any of the links on the screen. Clicking an 
event reveals its details. Click the Quick Add textbox, enter the event’s infor-
mation, and then click Add Now to add a new event.
 
You can enter Quick Add events in phrase form, such as Tennis lessons 
every Thursday at 9am.
Scheduling with SMS
Text messaging is a quick, easy way to find out what’s coming up on your 
schedule — especially when you’re away from your computer. You need to 
register your phone with your calendar first, though. Flip to the earlier sec-
tion, “Registering your mobile phone to receive notifications,” which explains 
how to set up calendar notifications on your mobile phone.
After you set up your phone with Google Calendar, you can simply send a 
text message with one of the commands in the following bullet list to GVENT 
(48368), and you receive a text message giving you the event information you 
request.
 
Although you can use the GVENT service free, your mobile carrier may charge 
for each text message that you send and receive. Check your plan before using 
GVENT extensively.
Send any one of these commands in a text message to GVENT and wait for a 
response:

346
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ NEXT: Receive the upcoming event for the day.
 
✓ DAY: Receive an agenda of today’s events.
 
✓ NDAY: Receive an agenda of tomorrow’s events.
 
✓ “Meeting tomorrow at 2pm”: Send event details to create a new event 
on your calendar via Quick Add. Remember that Google Calendar breaks 
down your Quick Add requests into common phrases and tries to guess 
what you meant. Pretty smart, if you ask us.
 
✓ HELP: Receive a list of these commands.
 
✓ STOP: Remove your phone number from Google Calendar to stop notifi-
cations and other calendar messages. You have to reregister your phone 
to use GVENT again.
More resources for Google Calendar
If you want to know more about Google Calendar 
than we cover in this book, we’re happy to point

D
oes the daily ritual of purging your Inbox besiege you? Messages appear 
unrelentingly. Responding to e-mail can eat into your day, taking valuable 
time away from more important tasks, such as enjoying a leisurely lunch. Many 
of these e-mails are trivial, others are inane, and then you have spam — unso-
licited ads for products too bizarre to mention. For businesses, schools, and 
agencies, e-mail has become a necessary evil. It’s costly to maintain, mailboxes 
are limited, and service is often hurt by a lack of local resources.
Gmail is Google’s answer to the daily e-mail onslaught and the hassle busi-
nesses, schools, and agencies face maintaining their own systems. It’s 
Google’s interpretation of how e-mail should work. Gmail can help you battle 
back and get control of your Inbox, eliminating many of the frustrations asso-
ciated with the spam-clogged, virus-ridden e-mail systems of the past.
Setting Up E-Mail
Electronic mail finds its way through the Internet by following an address. Every 
e-mail address, such as calredwood@ardsleybooks.com, has three parts:
 
✓ The username, nickname, buddy name, or handle of the account owner. 
In our example, the username is calredwood.
 
✓ The characteristic @ sign (pronounced “at”).
 
✓ The name of the domain or Web site that hosts the e-mail service. In our 
example, the domain name is ardsleybooks.com.

348
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Starting Gmail
You can get to your Gmail account a couple of ways. The most convenient 
method is to use the Email gadget on your organization’s start page or on a 
Sites page that you’ve designed.
If, for some reason, you don’t want to use a gadget, you can access your 
e-mail directly at http://mail.google.com if you have a personal 
account. If you are a Google Apps user, enter mail followed by the domain 
name of your organization in the address bar and press Enter; for example, 
an employee of Ardsley Books would use the address http://mail.ards
leybooks.com. This address takes you to your Gmail login page, where you 
can log into your e-mail account.
 
You need to log in with your username and password every time you begin a 
new session of Gmail unless you select the Remember Me on This Computer 
option when it appears.
Getting to Know the Inbox
Any message coming to you arrives in your Inbox. From your Inbox, you can 
access any feature within Gmail by using the Navigation panel on the left side 
of the screen and the other links around the page. Here are the key parts, as 
shown in Figure 19-1:
 
✓ Links to other Google Apps: Quickly jump to your start page, calendar, 
documents, and more by clicking the links in the top-left corner of the 
screen.
 
✓ Your e-mail address: In case you forget, Gmail gives you a friendly 
reminder at the top.
 
 If you have more than one Gmail account, you can always tell which 
account you’re currently using by looking at your e-mail address at the 
top of the Gmail window.
 
✓ Search Mail and Search the Web: Enter a term in the textbox and click 
the Search Mail button to search your messages for the term; click the 
Search the Web button to do a normal Google search.
 
✓ Compose Mail: Click this link to open a message window in which to 
write a new e-mail message.
 
✓ Inbox, Starred, Chats, Sent Mail, Drafts, All Mail, Spam, and Trash: 
These links in the left column take you to the standard folders that hold 
your messages.

349
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
✓ Contacts: This section lets you manage your Contacts list, not just for 
Gmail, but also for your Video Chat, Talk, and Calendar apps. Jump 
ahead to Chapter 20 to find more about this essential tool. 
 
✓ Incoming messages: Your messages appear in the center of the screen, 
and any new messages appear in bold. Messages that you already read 
have a shaded background.
 
✓ Labels: Your messages can be tagged with multiple labels. Labels are 
similar to traditional folders but are much more flexible.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Find 
everything 
in Gmail’s 
Inbox.
 
 
Gmail encourages users to archive old messages, not trash them. With so 
much storage available, you don’t need to delete messages that may have pos-
sible importance later. Google can make this suggestion confidently because, 
no matter how many messages you archive, you can find the one you need 
quickly with Google’s powerful search technologies. If Google can find exactly 
what you need from the billions of pages on the Internet, imagine what it can 
do when searching a relatively tiny Inbox. More on Search later!
Composing Mail
When you’re ready to create an e-mail message, click the Compose Mail link 
in the left column of your Inbox, which opens an e-mail form. E-mail forms 
are organized into fields. A few fields are required; others are optional. We 
discuss each of these fields in detail in the following sections. As shown in 
Figure 19-2, the main parts of the mail form are

350
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
Figure 19-2: 
The 
Compose 
Mail form.
 
 
✓ Header: The header section includes the To and Subject textboxes. It 
also includes the Add Cc, Add Bcc, and Attach a File links, as well as the 
Send, Save Now, and Discard buttons.
 
• To: Enter the e-mail address of the primary recipients in the To 
box. (If you can’t remember an e-mail address, click the Choose 
from Contacts link to choose a name from the Contacts list.)
 
• Add Cc: Referred to by its historical name, carbon copy, or by an 
updated name, courtesy copy. Enter an e-mail address in the Cc 
box if you’re simply informing someone of a message sent primar-
ily to others.
 
• Add Bcc: Known as blind courtesy copy. Enter e-mail addresses in 
this box for those who you want to inform about a message, but 
need to hide from others that they received it. Sneaky, isn’t it?
 
• Add Event Invitation: Click this link to add appointment details to 
your message and create a new event on your calendar. If your 
recipient uses Google Calendar or Outlook, the event will appear 
on their calendar, as well.
 
✓ Body: The meat of the message goes in the message, or body, field. This 
section also includes the Formatting toolbar and Check Spelling tools.
To send an e-mail message, follow these basic steps:
 
1. Click the To textbox and enter the addresses of those to which you 
want to send the message.
 
 This is a required field. If you don’t put at least one e-mail address in 
this textbox, you get a plea from Gmail reading, “Please specify at least 
one recipient.” Optionally, click the Add Cc link to see the Cc and Bcc 
textboxes.

351
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
2. (Optional) Type a comma and then enter another e-mail address.
 
 You can add as many e-mail addresses as you want. Gmail automatically 
enters the open (‹) and close (›) angle brackets that appear before and 
after e-mail addresses. You don’t need to enter them.
 
3. Click the Subject textbox and enter a subject.
 
 In the Subject textbox, enter a few descriptive words to let your reader 
know what the e-mail message is about.
 
4. Click the message field and type what you want to say.
 
5. Click the Send button.
 
Gmail automatically adds the e-mail address of anyone you e-mail, or anyone 
who e-mails you, to your Contacts list. When you begin entering a few letters 
in the To or Cc textbox, Gmail anticipates the address you’re typing and dis-
plays recipient names containing those letters. Arrow down to select the cor-
rect e-mail address. When it appears highlighted, press Enter or just choose 
it from the list. (You can find out much more about your Contacts list later in 
this chapter.)
Composing and formatting messages
You compose all of your great one-liners, tell your jokes, speak your mind, 
and set things straight in the message (or body) field. Simply click the body 
textbox and start typing.
 
You can use the formatting buttons just above the body textbox to apply bold, 
italic, colors, highlighting, and other formatting to your text. To apply text 
formatting, simply highlight the text that you want to format and then click the 
appropriate formatting button.
Attaching files
You can attach any file to an e-mail: a word processing document, a spread-
sheet, a picture of your dog Charlie, or that video of your recent fishing trip. 
To attach a file to your message, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Attach a File link that appears below the Subject textbox.
 
2. Browse to the particular file that you need, select it, and then click the 
Open button.
 
 The name of the attached file appears just below the subject line in your 
e-mail form.

3. If you want to add another file, click the Attach Another File link that 
appears below the name of the file you attached.

After you finish composing your message and adding attachments, you have 
three options:
 
✓ Send: Click the Send button and your message whisks across the 
Internet.
 
✓ Save Now: If you’re having second thoughts about sending a particular 
e-mail message, or if you simply haven’t finished it yet, you can save it 
and work on it later. To save your message, click Save Now.
 
✓ Discard: Okay, you vented, exaggerated, or suddenly realized you don’t 
know what the heck you’re talking about. No harm done. Just click the 
Discard button and forget the whole thing.
Stacking Up a Gmail Conversation
Gmail records the back-and-forth between people as though it were a natural 
conversation. Gmail stacks replies, one on top of another. The most recent 
replies appear at the top. In Google parlance, this is a conversation stack.
The Inbox displays each message’s subject line, followed by a snippet of the 
message. These bits of information give you clues as to what the conversa-
tion is about. You can tell how many reply cards are in the stack by the 
number that appears in parentheses after the senders’ names, as shown in 
Figure 19-3. You can also see the date a message or reply was sent at the end 
of the snippet.
 
Figure 19-3:

versations 
in your 
Inbox.

 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
A conversation appears as a stack of messages, as shown in Figure 19-4. Think 
of a stack as a pile of cards, each containing the next part of a conversation. 
To view any part of the conversation in the stack, pick it from the list by click-
ing on the message’s sender, subject line, or date.
Stacked headers give you a lot of information and several options. First, you 
can tell exactly when the reply was sent by looking in the top-right corner of 
any message in the stack. Also, you can send related e-mails from each stack 
in the conversation as follows:
 
✓ Reply: Reply only to the sender. You can find a Reply link at both the 
top and the bottom of the message.
 
✓ Reply to All: Click Reply to All to send a reply to everyone involved in 
the conversation. (Find Reply to All by clicking the down arrow next to 
the Reply button or jump to the bottom of the message window.)
 
✓ Forward: Send a copy of the e-mail message to anyone you want: the 
news media, your boss, the Federal Trade Commission, Homeland 
Security . . . (Find Forward by clicking the down arrow next to the Reply 
button or jump to the bottom of the message window.)

tion.
 
 
Very few people enjoy sifting through replies that don’t apply to them. The 
Reply to All command has annoyed millions of unhappy cubicle inhabitants 
in offices all over the world, so click it thoughtfully. If you’re sending a reply 
intended for a single recipient, don’t send it to everyone listed in the header.

Collapsing and expanding stacks
After you open a conversation stack, it appears in a collapsed view with the 
most recent reply at the bottom. To expand the stack so that you can view all 
the conversations, click the Expand All link (it’s to the right of the conversa-
tion stack). To collapse the conversations, click the Collapse All link. To read 
just one reply or part of the conversation, click the snippet or header at the 
top of the particular message.
 
To break away from a conversation stack, start by replying to the last 
message. Click the Edit Subject link, enter a new subject, and send your new 
message. Any replies to this new message appear in a separate stack.
Marking important messages
Gmail gives you a simple way to highlight important messages. Whether 
you’re in the Inbox or viewing a conversation, simply click the Star icon on 
the left side of the message header, and a bright, shiny star appears in the 
icon’s place. (See Figure 19-5.) Remove a star by clicking the Star icon again.
 
Figure 19-5: 
Mark the 
stars to 
the left of 
important 
messages.
 
To view just the messages that you’ve starred, click the Starred link in the 
left column. (Clicking the Inbox link shows you all of your current messages 
again.)
In the Inbox, the check boxes to the left of the Star icons allow you to select 
multiple messages at the same time. After you select the check boxes, you 
can perform the following actions to all the selected messages.

355
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
✓ Archive: Archiving conversations places selected messages in storage 
and removes them from your Inbox. Archiving is a great way to save 
your messages, but still remove them from your Inbox so you don’t have 
to deal with the clutter.
 
✓ Report Spam: If you receive spam, select that message’s check box and 
let Gmail know about it by clicking the Report Spam button. Reporting 
spam helps Gmail do a better job of stopping it.
 
✓ Delete: Clicking the Delete button removes conversations from your 
Gmail account. Deleting a message only places the message in the Trash 
folder. To get rid of the message permanently, you must go into the 
Trash folder and delete it again from that screen (or leave it — any mail 
in the trash more than 30 days gets automatically deleted).
Searching Your Messages
You can use the same powerful Google Search tools that allow you to find 
exactly what you need on the Internet to find a lost message in your Inbox or 
in your Archived messages folder. To search your e-mail account for a par-
ticular message, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the search box that appears at the top of every Gmail account 
page and enter a search term.
 
 You can search for e-mail addresses, subjects, or even text within a mes-
sage. For example, say you remember only a snippet of an e-mail sent 
to you, such as Uncle Jake is having a birthday. Enter the keywords jake 
birthday. The same rules that apply to a Google search on the Internet 
apply to your e-mail searches, as well:
 
• Statistics point out that a phrase of two to five words is better than 
a single keyword in narrowing a search.
 
• If you put words in quotation marks (“ ”), Google searches for that 
exact phrase.
 
• You don’t need to use capitalization.
 
2. Click the Search Mail button.
 
 As shown in Figure 19-6, Gmail returns a list of messages that contain 
the term(s) you enter in the search box in Step 1.

conversa-
tions by 
using the

feature.
 
Opening Attachments
Every time you receive documents, spreadsheets, images, or presentations as 
attachments, you have several ways you can open them directly from Gmail:
 
✓ View as HTML: The first option is to view the attachment as a Web page 
right in your browser. You don’t need any special plug-ins or software 
to view an attachment as HTML because Google uses special tools to 
extract the text and graphics so that you can preview the document 
right away. This method is also the fastest way to get to your important 
proposal or budget report. It works for PDF attachments, too.
 
✓ Open as a Google Document or Spreadsheet: Rather than save the 
document to your computer, you can simply choose to open the attach-
ment as a Google document or spreadsheet, or view a presentation as a 
slideshow, directly in your browser.
 
 When you open an attachment in Google Docs, you can view and edit the 
document right away. Gmail copies the document into your Docs Home, 
and you can access that document any time you login to Google Docs.
 
✓ Download: For documents that have advanced formatting, or don’t open 
easily as HTML or a Google document, you still have the traditional file 
download method. Click the Download link to the right of the attach-
ment. The File Download dialog box appears, asking whether you want 
to open or save the file. If you would like to find the file on your com-
puter later, we recommend that you click the Save button to save the 
file. The Save As dialog box appears, giving you the option to navigate 
to the folder on your computer where you want to save the file. Finally, 
click the Save button to save the file.
 
 Mail messages that contain multiple attachments also give you the 
option to download all your files at the same time in a Zipped archive. 
Click the Download All Attachments link to start saving yourself a lot of 
time by downloading one smaller file.

357
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
 Don’t forget, Google automatically scans your attachments for viruses. 
To keep you extra safe, Gmail never accepts attachments that contain 
executable files (files that end in .exe) or archives that contain executa-
bles. If you need to send or receive those types of files, you have to 
resort to another method of transporting the files, such as using an FTP 
or file transfer site (such as YouSendIt.com).
 
 If you really must send an executable file using Gmail, try this: On your 
computer, change the .exe extension to .zip or .ppt and attach it to 
your e-mail. Then let your recipient know that they should change the 
extension back to .exe when they download it to their computer.
Creating Signatures and 
Vacation Responses
If it’s imperative that people can readily get in touch with you, it’s a good 
idea to let them know alternate ways of contacting you other than via your 
e-mail address. You can do this by adding a signature that contains your con-
tact information. A signature is a block of text automatically appended to the 
end of your outgoing e-mail messages. Additionally, vacation responses, which 
send an automated response to all your incoming e-mail messages while 
you’re away, help people know when you’re unavailable, whether you’re on a 
trip to Hawaii, or spending a quiet weekend at home.
Adding a signature
To add a signature, log into your Gmail Inbox and click the Settings link in the 
top-right corner. Halfway down the Settings page, look for the Signature box.
You can type whatever you want in the Signature box, but most people 
include their name, a phone number, perhaps a Web site URL, and a random 
quote (such as a Zen saying that makes absolutely no sense to anyone who’s 
not a monk). To make your signature active, make sure that the radio button 
to the left of the signature box is selected, and then click the Save Changes 
button at the bottom of the Settings page. After you activate your signature, 
it appears in the message body automatically, as Figure 19-7 illustrates.

358

Turning the vacation responder on and off
When you’re ready for your break from the everyday onslaught of e-mail, flip 
the switch to turn on your vacation responder. A vacation responder lets 
people know that you’re on vacation, out of the office, or don’t want to get 
back to them right away. When they e-mail you, Gmail automatically sends a 
message of your choosing informing them that you are unavailable, so they 
don’t have to worry when you don’t get back to them in two seconds flat. To 
turn your vacation responder on, follow these steps:
 
1. Log into Gmail.
 
2. Click the Settings link in the top-right corner of the screen.
 
 Near the bottom of the page, you can see the Vacation Responder 
section, as shown in Figure 19-8.
 
Figure 19-8:
 Add a 
vacation 
responder 
on the 
Settings 
page.
 
 
3. Select the Vacation Responder On radio button.
 
4. Click the Subject and Message textboxes and enter a subject and 
message that lets people know you’re on vacation (or otherwise 
unavailable).

359
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
 If you use your Gmail for business, give contact information for someone 
who can cover for you while you’re unavailable.
 
5. (Optional) If you don’t want everyone to know that you’ve snuck off 
on a weekend getaway to Rome, select the Only Send a Response to 
People in My Contacts check box.
 
 When you select this check box, only people you know receive the mes-
sage from your vacation responder.
 
6. Click the Save Changes button.
When you activate your vacation responder, a peach-colored notification 
bar appears along the top of your Gmail page. To turn off your responder, 
click the End Now link on the right side of the bar (or select the Vacation 
Responder Off radio button in Step 3). If you want to make changes or update 
your e-mail response, click the Vacation Settings link to the right of the End 
Now link.
 
Vacation responders send only one e-mail per address every four days, and 
you can have only one vacation responder active at a time. Hopefully, your 
friends and associates catch the drift the first time.
Using Labels and Filters
You can whip your Inbox into shape by using labels and filters. Labels are like 
folders, only better — they sort and organize your messages so that you can 
easily find a particular message later. Filters are sets of rules that every new 
e-mail message is checked against; if the message matches a rule, then Gmail 
performs an action with the message, such as starring or deleting it.
How can labels and filters help you? Imagine sending all your incoming work-
related messages to one folder and your travel plans to another. Filters let 
you tell Gmail exactly where the messages should go, and labels help you 
organize messages that you’ve already received.
Labeling your messages
If you’ve used other e-mail programs, you’re probably used to creating fold-
ers and storing your messages in them. The problem is you have to remem-
ber in which folder you placed those messages. Labels alleviate memory 
lapses by allowing you to tag messages and view all your similarly tagged 
messages in a list, much like a folder. Unlike folders, however, you don’t have 
to move any messages around, and you can easily tag a message with mul-
tiple labels.

360
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
To create labels, click the Edit Labels link in the Labels list in the bottom-left 
corner of any Gmail screen. You can also click the Settings link at the top 
of the screen and then click the Labels tab, as shown in Figure 19-9. On the 
Labels tab, you can do the following:
 
Figure 19-9: 
Click the 
Edit Labels 
link to add, 
rename, 
and remove 
labels.
 
 
✓ Add a new label: Click the Create a New Label textbox, enter the new 
label’s name, and then click the Create button.
 
✓ Rename a label: Click the Rename link to the right of the label that you 
want to change. A blue box appears, allowing you to change the label 
name or enter a new label name. Click OK when you’re done, to return to 
the Labels Settings screen.
 
✓ Delete a label: Click the Remove link to the right of the label name. A 
dialog box appears, asking whether you really want to remove the label. 
Click OK, and the label disappears.
When you’re ready to tag a message or two, return to the Inbox. Select the 
check box to the left of the message(s) that you want to tag, and then choose 
a label from the More Actions list at the top of the screen. The label that you 
choose now appears to the left of your message’s subject, and your message 
now appears when you click the corresponding label link on the left side of 
the screen.
You can also customize your labels by adding colors. Click the color square 
to the right of a label in the Labels list and choose the color that you want. 
Dark and bold colors can really make more-important messages stand out.
Creating new filters
Filters help keep your Inbox free of clutter by automatically performing an 
action on a message as soon as it’s received, such as deleting any message 
from a certain e-mail address. You can create as many filters as you want; you 
can best keep your Inbox clutter free by creating a good number of filters.

361
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
Creating effective filters involves two steps. First, choose the type of mes-
sages that you want to filter; second, choose an action that you want Gmail to 
perform on those messages.
To create a new filter, follow these steps:
 
1. Log into your Google Apps Gmail (if you haven’t already).
 
2. Click the Settings link at the top of the screen.
 
3. Click the Filters tab. (See Figure 19-10.)
 
Figure 19-10: 
Create a 
new filter on 
the Settings 
page.
 
 
4. Click the Create a New Filter link.
 
5. Describe what messages you want the filter to catch by filling in the 
Choose Search Criteria textboxes. (See Figure 19-11.)
 
6. Click the Next Step button and then select the appropriate check 
boxes on the Choose Action screen that appears.
 
 See the later “Choose an action” section for details.
 
7. Click the Create Filter button to create your filter.
Choose your search criteria
You have six different ways to filter the messages, and you can use any com-
bination to help you narrow your list of filtered messages further.
 
✓ From: Enter an e-mail address or the name of a person or company that 
you want to filter, such as cal@ardsleybooks.com or Cal.
 
✓ To: Find messages that were sent to another person. You can also use 
this option to find messages that were sent to a mailing list.
 
✓ Subject: Enter keywords that appear in the message’s subject line.
 
✓ Has the Words: Enter keywords that may appear anywhere in the mes-
sage, including the subject and address fields.
 
✓ Doesn’t Have: Enter keywords in this textbox to show messages that 
don’t contain a specific word or e-mail address.

362
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
 The keywords in all the fields work together to limit your search results. 
For example, enter wall in the Has the Words textbox and enter face-
book in the Doesn’t Have textbox to find messages from the Wall Street 
Journal, but not messages notifying you that someone wrote on your 
Facebook Wall.
 
✓ Has Attachment: Select this check box to filter messages that contain 
attachments. This setting is also useful in conjunction with keywords in 
other fields.
 
Figure 19-11: 
Choose 
your filter’s 
search 
criteria.
 
 
If you want to use the same action for messages that have many different 
fields, type OR or a comma between the keywords, such as delta OR united 
OR american airlines OR continental for travel-related messages and face-
book, myspace, linkedin for messages from social networking sites.
After you enter the keywords, click the Test Search button to see how well 
the filter works on your existing messages. A list appears just below your 
filter box, showing you all the messages that match your search criteria.
Choose an action
In the Choose an Action screen, you need to decide what to do with your 
newly filtered messages. You can choose from six different options, and you 
can select more than one action to perform, as shown in Figure 19-12.
 
Figure 19-12: 
Add an 
action or 
two to your 
filtered 
messages.
 

363
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
You can choose one or more of the following actions:
 
✓ Skip the Inbox (Archive It): Select this option to have the message 
automatically sent to the All Mail label.
 
✓ Mark as Read: Choose this action and filtered messages no longer 
appear bold and therefore don’t show up as new messages.
 
✓ Star It: Highlight important messages with a Star icon.
 
✓ Apply the Label: Select this check box, click the arrow to the right of 
Apply the Label, and choose a label from the drop-down list. Filtered 
messages will have this label attached automatically, allowing you to 
access them quickly by clicking the label on the left side of your Gmail 
screen.
 
✓ Forward It To: Select this check box, click in the textbox to the right 
of Forward It To, and enter the address to which you want the message 
forwarded.
 
✓ Delete It: Select this check box to create your own spam filter — you 
never even have to see the message.
Adjusting filters later
After you set up a filter, you may find that it doesn’t run quite how you want 
it to. Follow these steps to adjust a filter you’ve set up:
 
1. Click the Settings link at the top of the screen and then click the 
Filters tab.
 
 The Filters tab lists all the filters you’ve created.
 
2. Click the Edit link to the right of the filter that you want to change.
 
 The Choose Search Criteria screen appears and shows what you previ-
ously entered for the filter.
 
3. Change the options in the Choose Search Criteria screen as desired. 
(Refer to the earlier “Choose your search criteria” section for details.) 
Click the Next Step button.
 
4. Change the options in the Choose Action screen as desired. (Refer to 
the preceding section for details.) Click the Update Filter button.
 
If you don’t like the filter after all, click the Delete link to the right of the filter, 
and that filter disappears forever.

Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Alternative Access: Forwarding, 
POP/IMAP, and Mobile
In the following sections, we cover how to enable forwarding so that you 
can send your e-mail somewhere other than your Gmail Inbox (if your 
administrator allows you to), how to sync Outlook with your Gmail mailbox 
with POP or IMAP, and even how to check your messages on the go from 
your Web-enabled mobile phone.
Turning forwarding on and off
E-mail forwarding is one of the best ways to consolidate e-mail from multiple 
addresses. If your Google Apps Gmail account isn’t your primary account, 
you can turn forwarding on in two clicks and pass your Gmail messages on to 
your primary account.
 
If you have a personal Gmail account, you can also use this option to forward 
your personal e-mail to your Google Apps account. Then you only have to look 
in one place for all your messages.
To set up forwarding for your Google Apps e-mail, log into Gmail and click the 
Settings link in the top-right corner of the screen. Click the Forwarding and 
POP/IMAP tab, as shown in Figure 19-13.
 
Figure 19-13: 
Decide what 
you want 
to do with 
forwarded 
messages.
 
Here’s a brief description of what you can do in the Forwarding and POP/
IMAP tab:
 
✓ Disable Forwarding: Select this radio button if you don’t want your 
messages going anywhere.
 
✓ Forward a Copy of Incoming Mail: Select this radio button to send a 
copy of all incoming messages to another address. Enter the address 
that you want your messages to go to in the textbox, and click the arrow 
below Forward a Copy of Incoming Mail, and then choose one of the 
following options from the drop-down list that appears:

365
 Chapter 19: Communicating with Gmail
 
• Keep Gmail’s Copy in the Inbox: Everything happens invisibly. Your 
messages are forwarded, and Gmail never knows.
 
• Archive Gmail’s Copy: New messages don’t appear in the Inbox, but 
you still can read them from your Gmail account by clicking the All 
Mail link.
 
• Delete Gmail’s Copy: Gmail deletes forwarded messages from your 
Gmail account.
 
If you want to forward only certain messages, create a filter (flip to the section, 
“Creating new filters,” earlier in this chapter) and check the Forward It To check 
box in the Choose Action screen. Enter an address in the Forward It To textbox, 
and Gmail passes on only those select messages to the address you specify.
Sending mail from different accounts
When you have several e-mail addresses to manage, such as your personal 
one, one for work, and one for your soccer league, Gmail makes it easy to 
send and receive all your messages in one place, from up to five different 
accounts.
To add an account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Settings link in the top-right corner of the Gmail main page.
 
 The Gmail Settings screen appears with tabs along the top.
 
2. In the Settings screen, click the Accounts tab, which you can see in 
Figure 19-14.
 
Figure 19-14: 
Use the 
Accounts 
tab in 
Settings 
to send 
e-mail from

3. In the Send Mail As section, click the Add Another Email Address link.
 
 A new window opens, asking you for the name and address that you 
want to add.

366
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
4. Fill in the information and click the Next Step button.
 
 The screen that appears asks you to verify that you are, in fact, the 
owner of the address you enter in this step.
 
5. Click the Send Verification button.
 
 The next screen asks you to enter a verification code. When you click 
the Send Verification button, the Gmail team sends a message to your 
other e-mail account. Because the message contains a link that will 
automatically verify your account, you can skip entering the verification 
code at this time and simply close the verification window. This should 
take you back to your Gmail screen.
 
6. In a new browser window, log into the e-mail account that you enter 
in Step 4 and look for the new message from the Gmail team.
 
7. Open the message and click the very long, cryptic-looking link to 
verify your address.
 
 If you leave the window open in Step 5, you can copy and paste the 
verification code from the message into that window and click the Verify 
button.
Congratulations! Now your other e-mail address is verified. The next time 
you compose a new message in Gmail, the From field is a drop-down list from 
which you can select your Google Apps e-mail address or your other e-mail 
account.
Activating POP or IMAP
POP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) 
both provide you access to your Gmail messages from other e-mail programs, 
such as Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, and Mozilla Thunderbird.
To activate POP or IMAP, follow these steps:
 
1. Log into Gmail and click the Settings link at the top of the Gmail page.
 
2. Click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.
 
 Your screen should look similar to Figure 19-15.
 
3. To turn on IMAP, select the Enable IMAP radio button.
 
4.  (Optional) To turn on POP, select the Enable POP for All Mail radio 
button or the Enable POP for Mail That Arrives from Now On radio 
button.
 
5. Click the Save Changes button.

Accessing Gmail from your mobile device
We’re not sure whether you’re the type of person who sits on the edge of 
your seat waiting for your next e-mail to arrive and responds to those mes-
sages as fast as they come, or whether you’re the casual type who’s content 
with just checking your e-mail occasionally. No matter your level of e-mail 
anxiety, Gmail makes it easy to check your messages, even when you’re away 
from a computer.
Google’s new Android phones are perfectly suited for Gmail and the other 
Google Apps. If you have an Android-enabled phone, Gmail and Calendar 
icons appear in your launcher. Simply open the apps and log into your 
account to access your messages on the go. 
If you’re a BlackBerry debutant, open your mobile browser and go to 
http://m.google.com/a to download a special Gmail client. This appli-
cation gives you many of the same features as the normal Gmail interface. 
Simply log in by using your Google Apps account username and password, 
and you’re good to go.
iPhone fanatics can use the iPhone’s built-in Mail client to access Gmail, as 
well. If you want your messages to sync back to the main program, be sure 
to set up a custom IMAP account. (See the earlier “Activating POP or IMAP” 
section to find out how to set up an IMAP account.) You can find detailed 
instructions for setting up Gmail on your iPhone by logging into Gmail, click-
ing the Settings link at the top of the screen, clicking the Forwarding and 
POP/IMAP tab on the Settings page, and finally, clicking the Configuration 
Instructions link.
If you have a simple Web-enabled phone, open your phone’s Web browser 
application and navigate to www.gmail.com or http://mail.your
domain.com. Enter your Google Apps account username and password on 
the login page that appears, and then press the Sign In button. Links to your 
messages and your labels appear in a very simple, easy-to-use format.

Chapter 20
Enhancing Communication 
with Google Contacts, 
Chat, and Talk
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know your Contacts list
▶ Sorting and changing your Quick Contacts list
▶ Creating, editing, and using groups
▶ Putting Gmail Video Chat to work
▶ Stepping up to Google Talk
T
his chapter is all about creating, adding to, and using your Contacts list 
with Gmail, Gmail Chat, and Google Talk. Your Contacts list also fuels 
your Google Calendar (which we talk about in Chapter 18). After all, you need 
to keep track of the people you communicate with, and Google helps you in 
that task with its sophisticated Contacts list.
The Contacts list is a powerful database where you keep track of your 
friends, co-workers, and other online acquaintances. In addition to e-mail 
addresses, the Contacts list lets you add address, phone numbers, photos, 
important dates, and other notes about your favorite people. If you have a 
Google Apps account, other users in your domain are added automatically. 
When you invite people to chat, they appear in the Chat panel to the left of 
your Gmail screen and in Google Talk.
 Growing Your Contacts List
If all you need from the Contacts list is a little help addressing your e-mail, 
that’s valuable enough. But if you want to get the most out of this potent tool, 
take a few minutes and browse through the following pages.

372
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Gmail automatically adds a contact to Suggested Contacts when you reply to 
a message from someone. The Contacts list also accumulates addresses and 
information when you’re using the Google Chat and Talk Apps. You can use 
your Contacts list a little or a lot, depending on your needs. For instance:
 
✓ In Google Talk and Chat, your contacts are monitored to see who’s 
online and who’s available.
 
✓ In Gmail, the Contacts list allows you to enter just part of a name and 
have the most likely choices appear so you don’t have to type the entire 
e-mail address in the To textbox .
 
✓ In Google Calendar, you can use your Contacts list to facilitate the 
scheduling of attendees, rooms, and resources for meetings and events.
Viewing your contacts
Want to find your Contacts list? Okay, pay attention. If you blink, you may 
miss this:
 
1. Open Gmail.
 
2. Click the Contacts link in the left panel.
If your Google Apps administrator has set everything up according to Hoyle, 
you should see a list of the people in your organization — that is, all the col-
leagues in your domain listing. For example, all the employees at Ardsley 
Books were automatically added into the Contacts list shown in Figure 20-1. 
Groups that the organization created are also included in the Contacts list. 
We discuss groups in more detail in the “Sorting Contacts into Groups” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
 
Figure 20-1: 
View your 
Contacts list 
by clicking 
the Contacts 
link.
 

373
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
And it doesn’t stop there. Gmail keeps track of anyone you e-mail, reply to, 
or show the slightest interest in and adds them to the Suggested Contacts 
list. In Figure 20-1, you can see contacts from both inside and outside the 
Ardsleybooks.com domain. For instance, jake@ardsleybooks.com, an 
employee of the bookstore, is automatically added to the Contacts list for 
future reference.
Gmail automatically groups your contacts by these four categories:
 
✓ My Contracts: A list of everybody in your Contacts list. (Think of the 
proverbial kitchen sink.)
 
✓ Most Contacted: An abbreviated list of the most frequently used con-
tacts in your Contacts list. This list may include contacts that are not in 
your official list.
 
✓ Groups: A list of groups that either you or your organization creates. 
Groups facilitate e-mailing large numbers of people. Instead of repeat-
edly entering multiple e-mail addresses individually, a group can e-mail 
dozens, even hundreds of people with one common e-mail address. 
 
✓ Suggested Contacts: These are people that you exchanged e-mail 
messages with but that are not in your official list. Click a contact in 
this list and then click the Move to My Contacts button to add them to 
your contacts. 
Rolling through your Contacts list
Take a second to roll your mouse cursor slowly over the list of e-mail 
addresses that appears in your Contacts list. Pop, pop, pop, up come little 
contact cards with descriptions of each individual contact, as shown in Figure 
20-2. Unless you or your contacts add more robust information, these listings 
appear rather plain. However, you can add more pertinent information, includ-
ing pictures, which can help you remember what some of these people actually 
look like. (See the “Adding or Updating Contacts” section for details.)

Using Quick Contacts in Gmail
The Quick Contacts list, just as the name implies, is designed to save you 
time and add convenience to your Gmail, Chat, Talk, and Calendar apps. You 
can view your Quick Contacts list by clicking the triangle in the side panel 
beneath the Contacts link. Clicking this triangle opens an abbreviated list 
called the Quick Contacts list, as shown in Figure 20-3. Notice that you can 
search for contacts or click the Contacts link to view your entire Contacts list.
 
Figure 20-3: 
The Quick 
Contacts 
list.
 
Knowing when your contacts are online
A green dot appears to the left of Cal Redwood’s name in Figure 20-3. (Okay, 
in this black-and-white book, the dot looks gray — but trust us, it’s green.) 
A green dot means that person is online — a useful bit of information if you 
want to have a real-time conversation with that person by using Gmail Chat 
or Google Talk.
 
If you don’t want someone to see your green dot, you can block certain con-
tacts so they don’t interrupt you while you’re working, playing, or attending a 
meeting. To block visitors, set your status by clicking the down arrow next to 
Set Status Here. Look just below your name in the left panel. Read the follow-
ing section for details.
Prioritizing Quick Contacts
The Quick Contacts list displays your most frequently contacted people 
based on your e-mail and chatting habits. The automatically generated list 
may not always reflect your wishes, so you can make changes and prioritize 
your contacts to your liking. By adjusting your list, you can see at a glance 
which contacts are online and available for a quick chat. Also, contacts that 
you e-mail most often appear on the list, so you can simply click a name to 
launch a new Gmail message preaddressed to that person.

375
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
You may have other contacts that you need to banish to the background 
so they don’t take up valuable space in the visible portion of your Quick 
Contacts list. Not that you consider them second-class contacts; you simply 
don’t need to contact them frequently or in any great haste.
To customize your Quick Contacts list, display all of your contacts by 
clicking the Show All link at the bottom of the Quick Contacts list (refer to 
Figure 20-3).
 
After you display all your contacts, decide which contacts you want to show 
in your Quick Contacts list by selecting one of the following options in the 
Show in Quick Contacts column (see Figure 20-4):
 
✓ Always: Selecting Always shows this contact in your Quick Contacts list, 
well, always.
 
✓ Auto: Selecting Auto means that Gmail decides whether a contact is high 
frequency and will appear in your Quick Contacts list.
 
✓ Never: Selecting Never keeps this contact out of your Quick Contacts 
list.
 
✓ Block: Selecting Block prevents this person from contacting you via 
Chat. (However, this person can still e-mail you.)
 
Figure 20-4: 
Prioritize 
who 
appears in 
your Quick 
Contacts 
list.
 
Unearthing lost contacts
 
Even if you select Never or Block for a contact (see the preceding section for 
more on the Quick Contacts list options), you can still get to that person’s 
contact information whenever you need it by using the search tool in the 
Quick Contacts list. After you enter only a few letters in the search box, a list 
of contact names appears.
After you find the contact that you’re looking for, the Quick Contacts search 
box displays several options for that contact. Click the option that you need:

376
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ Mail: E-mail that contact.
 
✓ Invite to Chat: Invite the contact to a quick chat, plan lunch, share 
gossip, and maybe even get some work done.
 
✓ Show in Quick Contacts: Restore this person to your Quick Contacts list 
if you have deleted them for some reason.
 
✓ View Recent Conversations: Look up what you and your contact said 
while chatting.
 
✓ <Name>’s Profile: Open a contact’s profile. You can view his statistics, 
or add your own data to his contact information. (Your changes only 
appear in your copy of another’s profile.)
Adding or Updating Contacts
In the detailed Edit Contact window, you can change a contact’s information, 
alter details, or even change someone’s picture. You can also add e-mail, 
phone, and address information at any time, so you can reach out to anyone 
and remind them to pick you up for that preposterous office party. You have 
three ways to update a contact:
 
✓ Roll over any contact in your Quick Contacts list. When the contact 
card appears, click the More down arrow at the top of the contact card, 
choose Contact Details from the list that appears, and then click the Edit 
Contact Information link.
 
✓ Click the Contacts link in the left panel, roll over any contact in your 
Contacts list, click Contact Details, and then click the Edit Contact 
Information link.
 
✓ Search for a contact in the Quick Contacts list search box. When you 
find it, select <Name>’s Profile, click Contact Information, and finally, 
click the Edit Contact Information link from the card that appears.
To add a new contact, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Contacts list by clicking the Contacts link in the left panel 
or the Show All link at the bottom of the Quick Contacts list.
 
2. Click the Create Contact button.
Entering basic contact information
When you create a new contact, the following fields appear in the Contacts 
window (shown in Figure 20-5):

377
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
 
You can add more than one address, phone number, and so on by clicking the 
blue add link next to each field’s title.
 
✓ Name: Enter the contact’s first name followed by his last name in this 
textbox.
 
✓ Email: Enter your contact’s primary e-mail address in this textbox.
 
✓ Phone: Add a phone number here. Choose a number type from the 
drop-down menu to the right of the box.
 
✓ Address: Enter an address. When you save your contact, a Map link 
appears where you can quickly find the address on Google Maps.
 
✓ Instant Messaging: Add a username here for quick access to IM users. 
Gmail Chat connects automatically to Google Talk, AIM, and Jabber 
services.
 
✓ More Info: Click the plus button if you want to add more fields of 
information. Four new sections appear: Title, Company, Notes, and Other.
Click the Save button after you finish entering all the necessary data.
 
Figure 20-5: 
Add contact 
informa-
tion in the 
Contacts 
window.
 
Adding more information about a contact
You may need to add more fields than the basic ones provided in the Add 
Contact window, particularly if you’re entering information for business 
contacts. Add additional information by clicking the More Information link 
(refer to Figure 20-5). 
You may not always have the data fields that you need for a unique 
contact, such as fields for a second mobile phone or for a pager. Gmail lets 
you add fields by clicking the Add link next to any section. From there, you 

378
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
can choose from the standard fields: E-mail, IM, Phone, Mobile, Pager, Fax, 
Company, Title, or Other. And, if you want to change the name or purpose of 
a field, click the field box and type whatever name you want.
Adding a picture
You can add your picture to your personal contact information, and the 
picture is automatically shared with others throughout your network of con-
tacts. So make sure that you add a flattering photo.
You can use any image on your computer as your contact image. The only 
limitation is that the image must be in one of the following commonly used 
online file formats:
 
✓ JPG: Acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, JPG (or JPEG) is a 
popular online graphics format that uses compression to reduce the size 
of images.
 
✓ BMP: A bitmap file format proprietary to Microsoft Corporation.
 
✓ GIF: Acronym for the Graphics Interchange Format. This highly com-
pact, low-resolution format was originally designed by CompuServe for 
online use.
 
✓ PNG: Acronym for Portable Network Graphics. This compressed image 
format is similar to JPG in many ways, approved by the World Wide Web 
Consortium as a high-resolution alternative to the GIF format.
After you identify the picture that you want to use, click the name of your 
target contact. Note: You add your picture by choosing your name from the 
Contacts list.
Follow these steps to add a picture to a contact:
 
1. Click the Contacts link in the left panel.
 
2. Click the contact that you want to change and then click the Add a 
Picture link.
 
 The Choose a Picture window appears.
 
3. Click a link from the left side of the window, depending on where you 
want the picture to come from, and follow the instructions here:
 
• My Computer: Click the Choose File button, locate your photo in 
the Browse window that appears, and click Open.

379
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
 
• Picasa Web Albums: Type in the username (or yours) in the textbox 
and click through the online albums that appear. Click the image 
you want.
 
• Web Address (URL): Type in the URL for the image you want. If the 
address is correct, a preview of the image appears below. 
 
• Their Picture: If the user has their own image chosen already, this 
option will show their choice and update it whenever they change it.
 
• No Picture: Click Apply Changes to remove any picture and leave 
it blank.
 
4. Depending on your choice in Step 3, click either the Apply Changes or 
Select Image button.
 
5. (Optional) Crop the image, and click Apply Changes.
 
 To keep anyone from getting a big head, Gmail asks you to crop the 
image down to size. It displays the image in the Crop Your Picture dialog 
box. To crop your image, follow these steps:
 
a. Drag the selection box into a flattering position.
 
b. Drag the corners of the selection box to expand or reduce the selec-
tion box, as needed.
 
c. When you’re satisfied, click the Apply Changes button.
 
 The Edit Contact window reappears, and the picture you just uploaded 
and cropped now appears in the My Pick picture box. After a little 
adjustment, you can have nearly anyone, even your cross-eyed accoun-
tant friend down the hall, looking like a million bucks. The cropping 
doesn’t change the original file, so if you make a mistake cropping the 
image, you can always go back and try, try again.
 
 After you save a picture for a contact, the Suggest This Picture to 
<Name> dialog box appears, enabling you to share the picture you 
choose with that contact.
 
6. (Optional) If you have a flattering picture that you want to send to 
your boss or another colleague, enter a short note in thetextbox to the 
right of the picture in the Suggest This Picture to <Name> dialog box 
and then click the Yes, Suggest This Picture button.
 
 If you click the No, Keep This Picture to Myself button instead, Gmail 
doesn’t send the contact the picture that you use for her in your 
Contacts list. (We suggest that you resist the temptation to add a picture 
of a donkey to your boss’s contact information, however, in case he hap-
pens to see it when looking over your shoulder one day.)

Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
Sorting Contacts into Groups
Groups make it a snap to contact large numbers of people at the same time; 
for example, create a group of contacts who use your site and contact them 
in one click. Gmail assigns a single e-mail address (the group’s address) that 
contains multiple e-mail addresses including each member of the group. 
When you enter a group name in the To field, Gmail enters all the e-mail 
addresses for the entire group’s membership in a flash.
If you belong to a heads-up organization, an administrator may have created 
some of the key groups within your organization for you. Your company 
might create groups consisting of all employees, employees in a specific 
department, all senior managers, and so on. You can create a group of your 
friends, your immediate family members, or people who share your hobbies.
Creating groups
The best way to figure out how groups work is to create a group of your own. 
To create a group, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Contacts list and click the group from the list on the left.
 
 If you haven’t yet added a group, you see the screen shown in Figure 20-6.
 
Figure 20-6: 
Add a new 
group with 
the New 
Group 
button.
 
 
2. Click the New Group button.
 
3. In the Create Group window that appears, click the Group Name text-
box and enter a name that describes the group. Click OK to save the 
new group.

381
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
 
4. In the Add Contacts textbox, enter however many e-mail addresses 
you need to define as the group’s membership.
 
5. Click the Create Group button to save the group information.
Viewing and editing an existing group
If you have a contact that you want to add or remove from a group, you can 
always edit the contacts in the group. You can also rename the group. To 
view or edit a group, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Contacts and then click a group from the list on the left.
 
2. Make any changes that you want, including the following:
 
• Edit: Click the Edit link to change the name of your group.
 
• Add to this group: Type e-mail addresses into the Add Contacts 
textbox and then click the Add Contacts button to add members to 
the group.
 
• Delete Group: Click the Delete Group button.
E-mailing a group
Groups become part of your e-mail address database; consequently, you just 
have to enter the first few letters in the To textbox, and your group’s name 
appears. Select the name of the group, and the members’ e-mail addresses 
suddenly appear in the To textbox.
Understanding Gmail 
Chat and Google Talk
If e-mail has a downside, it’s that sometimes it just isn’t instantaneous 
enough. That’s why instant messaging and SMS (short messaging service; text 
messaging to you mobile phone users) were invented. Google takes care of 
your instant messaging and SMS needs with Gmail Chat and Google Talk.
In this chapter, we cover how to use Gmail Chat and Google Talk to have a 
real-time conversation with one or more of your contacts. We also cover how 
you can use Google Talk to have a voice conversation. Here’s some more 
information on these tools:

382
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
✓ Gmail Chat: A basic instant-messaging program that’s built right into 
Gmail.
 
✓ Google Talk: A more robust instant-messaging program that you can 
use as a gadget on your start page or Sites pages or download and use 
as a stand-alone program. With Google Talk, you can type messages to 
a contact so you can chat in real time, just as you can in Chat. You can 
also use a microphone and speakers (or a headset) to have a voice 
conversation with a contact or to leave a voice message.
When you’re ready to start chatting, you first need to figure out who’s online 
and available. You can see who’s ready to chat pretty simply; sign into Gmail 
(if you haven’t already) and look for a green dot to the left of a contact’s 
name in your Chat list. If you see the green dot, the contact’s ready to chat.
Inviting someone to chat in Gmail Chat
After you identify whether the person you want to instant message is online, 
starting up a chat in Gmail Chat is simple. Follow these steps:
 
1. Sign into Gmail (if you haven’t already).
 
2. In the Chat list on the left side of the screen, roll over the contact that 
you want to chat with and click the Chat button on the contact card 
that appears. (See Figure 20-7.)
 
Figure 20-7: 
Click the 
Chat button 
to invite 
someone 
to chat. 
 
 
 If you want to chat with someone who isn’t in your Chat list, click in the 
Chat search box, start to type the contact’s name, select his name from 
the list of contacts that appears, and then select Chat from the Options 
list that appears. This lets your contact know you want to talk. (At this 
point, you can also add the person to your Chat list by selecting Show in 
Chat from the Options list.)
 
3. In the Chat Invitations window, select the check box to the left of 
the contact(s) with whom you want to chat, and then click the Send 
Invites button. Others that you can chat with will also appear so you 
can make a group invitation.

383
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
 
 After you send an invitation, a message appears in your invitee’s Gmail 
window, asking if he wants to chat with you. (See Figure 20-8.) Don’t be 
offended if he declines. Your contact may just be busy.
 
 Also, if others want to chat with you, you receive an invitation similar 
to the one shown in Figure 20-8. You need to accept the invitation if you 
also want to chat.
 
Figure 20-8: 
Click Yes if 
you want to 
chat with 
someone.
 
Chatting away in Gmail Chat
After you set up everything for your chat and your contact has responded, 
start chatting! (See Figure 20-9.) Click the textbox at the bottom of the chat 
window, type a message, and press Enter to send the message.
 
Figure 20-9: 
Chat away!
 
Clicking the Pop-out option separates your entry window from your con-
versation, which allows you to see more of your conversation. Also, to help 
you know what your partner in chat is doing, a message indicating that the 
person is typing will appear.
 
You can hold multiple chats at the same time. You can open several contacts 
in separate chat windows and talk to each of them independently. You can 
also have a chat with multiple participants in the same window (say you invite 
more than one person to a chat, or you are invited to a chat with multiple par-
ticipants). If someone is chatting way off topic, click the arrow to the right of 
Options and select Block <Name> to block someone from your chat, as shown 
in Figure 20-10. Ah, the power you’ll feel blocking people right and left!

Starting a voice/video chat
If you have a microphone or webcam, you can make voice or video calls to 
users directly from Gmail. Users with video enabled show a camera icon next 
to their names in the Chat list.
 
Before you can use voice/video chat features in Gmail, you have to install a 
special plug-in. To do so in Internet Explorer, click the yellow ActiveX bar at 
the top of the screen. For Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, go to www.gmail.com/
videochat and click the Install Voice and Video Chat button. The plug-in 
installer starts automatically. Restart your browser to start video chatting.
To start a voice call, click a contact. In the new chat box that appears in 
the bottom-right corner of the screen, select the Video & More option and 
then choose Start Voice Chat from the list that appears. A ringing sound 
plays until your contact answers, just like a regular telephone. Click the 
Microphone button on the left to mute the call. To end the call, click the Hang 
Up button.
To start a video call, select the Video & More option in your contact’s chat 
box and choose Start Video Chat from the menu that appears. The ringing 
sound plays while you wait for your contact to answer, and a preview of your 
video appears in a screen above the chat box, similar to Figure 20-11.
Keeping track of chats
If you need to keep a record of a chat you had 
in Gmail Chat or Google Talk for any reason, 
Gmail makes it easy by sending you an e-mail 
message containing the entire chat’s text. And, 
because you can store and archive all your 
e-mail, you can always get to the chat record 
any time you want.
You can search for old chats as easily as you 
can search all your mail messages. Simply 
enter any part of the chat that you can remem-
ber in the search window (a few key words will 
do), and options start appearing. You can also 
search for chats by contact name or by date.

385
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
 
Make your video chat go full screen by hovering over the video and clicking 
the full screen button that appears in the top left corner of the video. Click the 
button again or press the Esc key to return to the smaller view. For more con-
trol of your video size, click the pop-out button (it’s the arrow to the right to 
the chat close button).

Changing your Chat status
If you’re signed into Gmail, you normally show up as online and available to 
chat to other people. To change your status (say you’re busy and don’t want 
your status to appear as online), follow these steps:
 
1. To customize your personal chat settings, in the Chat section in the 
left panel, click the down arrow to the right of Set Status Here and 
choose one of the following options from the list that appears:
 
• Available: Lets people know you’re available and willing to chat.
 
• Custom Message (for availability): Write a customized message that 
people see when they check your availability.
 
• Busy: Let people know that you’re busy and can’t chat right now.
 
• Custom Message (for busyness): Write a customized message that 
everyone sees when you’re busy.
 
• Sign Out of Chat: Close Chat temporarily.

386
Part V: More Google Apps You Can’t Do Without 
 
2. (Optional) To create a custom message, select the Custom Message 
option, click the empty textbox that appears, and type a short mes-
sage to your chat buddies. Clear this message later by accessing the 
Set Status Here option as described in Step 1 and choosing Custom 
Message.
 
 Your custom message appears in your list of options. You can create 
several custom messages and apply them whenever you want.
Accessing Google Talk
If you need a more powerful instant messaging application than Gmail Chat, 
Google Talk is your answer. Google Talk is a gadget that you can add to your 
start page or Sites pages, as shown in Figure 20-12. (See Chapter 6 if you need 
help adding this gadget.)
 
Figure 20-12: 
Add Google 
Talk as a 
gadget to 
your start 
page.
 
If you’re running Windows, you can add functionality to your Google Talk 
gadget, such as voice calls and file transfers, by downloading the Google Talk 
client. Go to www.google.com/talk and click the Download Google Talk 
button. Run the setup program and then log in using your full e-mail address 
and password.

387
 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
Inviting a contact to chat in Google Talk
After you have Google Talk working, either from a gadget or from the client 
itself, you may need to sign in. Your existing Gmail contacts automatically 
appear. To begin chatting, you pick users the same way you do in Gmail Chat.
To invite a contact to chat, follow these unbelievably easy steps:
 
1. Click a name from the list.
 
2.  Start typing or click Call to have a “phone call.” Honestly, isn’t a 
simple call more personal than a bunch of typed text? (For more on 
calls, see the “Making a call” section, later in this chapter.)
 
Use the search box (you know, the box with the magnifying glass in it) to find 
people to talk with by entering part of their names or e-mail addresses. After 
you locate chat buddies, you can add them to your Contacts list and invite 
them to chat.
Chatting with a contact in Google Talk
Google Talk (see Figure 20-13) works a lot like the chat application in Gmail, 
described earlier in this chapter. In fact, it’s almost 100 percent the same 
when it comes to chatting, so we will skip to a few new things you can do 
with Talk and Chat.

To add some fun, you can insert an emoticon into your message by typing any 
of the common symbols, such as ;), which Google Talk replaces with a winking 
smiley in your message when you press Enter. You can also click the smiley to 
the right of the textbox and select a face from the menu that appears.
You can keep chats private by not creating an e-mail record of the messages 
in your Gmail. (See the sidebar “Keeping track of chats” for more information 
about storing and searching chats.) Have a chat on the sly by clicking the 
down arrow in the upper right of the chat window and choosing Go Off the 
Record from the list that appears.
Chatting with a group
After you establish your list of contacts, you can chat with any or all of them 
as a group. After you start a basic chat with a contact, click the Group Chat 
button in Google Talk (see Figure 20-14). (To add additional people to your 
conversation in Gmail Chat, choose Options➪Group Chat.) In the textbox 
that appears at the top of the chat window, enter the e-mail addresses of 
other users and press the Enter key. Right away, they can begin chatting 
along with you (assuming they’re online, of course).
To talk to someone privately outside of the group chat, click that user’s 
name in the Chat list and a separate tab (Talk) or chat window (Gmail Chat) 
appears.

 Chapter 20: Enhancing Communication with Google Contacts, Chat, and Talk
Making a call
If you and a contact are both online, you can use Google Talk to make voice 
calls.
 
Both you and your contact must have the Google Talk client installed on your 
computers for this function to work. For best results, use a high-quality head-
set microphone and double-check to make sure that the sound levels are set 
properly before you begin.
To start a call, pick the name of the person you want to call. When their card 
appears, click the Call button or phone icon to the right of your contact’s 
name. You can then start a talkin’ . . . it’s that easy.
When you’re having a voice conversation in Google Talk, the talk window fea-
tures the following options and indicators, as shown in Figure 20-15:
 
✓ End Call: Click this button to terminate the voice call.
 
✓ Email: This button loads Gmail in your browser so you can send a quick 
message to your contact.
 
✓ Send Files: Click this button to locate a document or photo on your 
computer that you want to send to your contact. You can also drag 
a file from your computer desktop into your chat window to send it 
immediately.
 
✓ Mute: Click this button to turn your microphone off temporarily.
 
✓ Sound indicators: Shows with a volume indicator whether your Talk 
software is receiving input from a microphone.
 
 If you want to adjust your audio settings, click the Settings link in the 
upper-right corner of the Google Talk client window, and then choose 
Audio from the options on the left. You may also have to adjust your 
volume settings in your operating system’s control panel.
 
✓ Internet connection strength: Like bars on your mobile phone, these 
bars indicate your Internet connection’s speed. The more bars, the 
better.
If a contact doesn’t answer when you try to call, you have the opportunity to 
leave a voice mail.

Sending a voice mail
Voice mail options are the same as the options for regular voice calls. You 
can send voice mail to any of your contacts, even if they don’t use Google 
Talk or Gmail. When you want to send someone a voice mail, click the down 
arrow to the right of the Email button and choose Send Voicemail from the 
list that appears.
Voice mail messages appear alongside regular messages in Gmail, and you 
can either play them directly from Gmail or download them as MP3 files, as 
shown in Figure 20-16.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
e know there are a lot of ways to create your 
Google Site. We won’t get in the way of your 
creativity, but in case you hit a brain block, we begin this 
part with ten ideas for creating schemes and using Google 
gadgets to empower your team or fan club.
We end this part by sharing ten more Google apps and 
services that we think are especially worth looking at. 
They certainly make our lives easier. Although there are 
over thirty freebies out there, we’ve highlighted our 
favorites, including directory assistance and Sketch-Up.

Chapter 21
Ten More Ideas for Your Scheme
W
e’ve shown you the tools, you’ve tried the options, and now you’re 
ready to pull out all the stops and put Google Sites to work. In this 
chapter, we brainstorm a few ideas for Google Sites for your family, school, 
business, and nonprofit organization. Here are ten of our favorite scheme 
ideas. We don’t have enough room to write full chapters on any of these 
ideas, but each is a site that has actually been created and used to great suc-
cess. From the classroom to the boardroom, this list should spark a few great 
ideas for your site project.
Family Scheme
There is no more enjoyable use of Google Sites than to share online moments 
with family members. Use Sites to keep in touch with each other no matter 
how dispersed your family members may become.
Why not have an Announcements page where family can keep up with each 
other’s activities. And don’t forget the photo album of that trip to Disney 
World, your drive along the Blue Ridge Parkway, or the hike up to the base 
of Mount Rushmore. Post the annual holiday card online instead of mailing 
it. Each aunt and uncle can have his or her own, individual sub-page. Leave 
these pages up and updated all year long; why should the holiday ever end?
For the family with busy, tight schedules, creating separate calendars for 
each family member makes a lot of sense. The calendars can all be displayed 
together on one page so everyone knows who needs a ride to a swim prac-
tice, when that big piano recital will be held, and whose birthday is sneaking 
up on the horizon.

394
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Little League Scheme
With Google Sites, no group is deemed too small or insignificant. You can 
make the local Springville Giants Little League team as important as their 
major league equivalent at AT&T Park in San Francisco by giving them their 
own Web site.
If you’re creating such a site, don’t forget to include
 
✓ The season schedule
 
✓ Information needed by parents, such as the required registration, 
liability, and medical forms for easy download
 
✓ Pictures of the team in action as well as the annual team picture
 
✓ Team statistics
 
✓ Special awards and recognition for each child
 
✓ Safety tips and baseball rules
 
✓ Links to sites that teach the fundamentals of the sport
You may even want to include ads for some of your team’s sponsors on the 
team’s site. After all, a bit of free advertising can’t hurt your chances to win 
their sponsorship next season. (They may even kick in for some new uni-
forms.) Also, think about a link to stores that carry equipment that players 
need along with cost saving and shopping tips. This can be a big help to par-
ents trying to outfit the next A-Rod for the upcoming season.
Book Club Scheme
A book club scheme can work for many different types of groups and organi-
zations that meet frequently. Sites pages can be created to share the club’s 
book list. Don’t leave out a calendar of club meetings and special events, 
such as book signings, and drop in some gadgets that represent RSS feeds 
from a wide range of literary news and reviews.
Create a page that allows members to wiki about books they are reading. Let 
all the members contribute to an online review. Pick a moderator to edit the 
pages just in case one of your members can’t spell. (Heaven forbid.)
Links to online literary sites could be very helpful to members. Allow 
comments so members can talk about the literary sites to which you are 
linking. For example, you could provide links to book reviews, like those 
found in The New York Times Reading Room (http://readingroom.

395
 Chapter 21: Ten More Ideas for Your Scheme
blogs.nytimes.com). And don’t forget to create links to other book clubs, 
such as Oprah’s Book Club (http://www.oprah.com/entity/oprahs
bookclub), so your members can find out what others are recommend-
ing. Most of all, get copies of Google Sites & Chrome For Dummies for all 
your book club members. They will find it as riveting as the latest Grisham, 
Rowling, or King.
Corporate Retreat Scheme
Corporate retreats can quickly turn into mammoth organizational challenges. 
Every business, large or small, plans retreats. For example, a large corpora-
tion may need to bring its worldwide sales team together for training. Google 
Sites is perfect for this type of complex operation. For example, create a 
“Sales Force Conference 2010” page to coordinate all the aspects of the event.
 
✓ Planners can coordinate their own internal planning efforts on a sepa-
rate conference planning team site.
 
✓ Information including all the important details can be shared directly 
with those who are attending.
 
✓ Pages can even be translated into most major languages, if needed, by 
using Google’s Web page translation tools.
On the site for your participants, don’t forget to include a Countdown gadget 
leading up to the conference’s opening session. And remember the travel 
itinerary, complete with airport shuttle or cab information. Also, use Google 
Maps. Conference participants love maps. You can even get digital maps from 
the convention site staff that you can upload for your attendees. If the site 
has wireless access, and what convention site doesn’t, put the login instruc-
tions on your site.
Include preliminary agendas and room assignments. Participants will also 
need countdown reminders to important deadlines, such as the drop-dead 
dates for making hotel reservations or flight plans. Don’t forget to set up an 
e-mail group with Google Groups to send reminders to everyone. A clever 
trick is to tie the group to an RSVP sign-up link. This will help you build the 
mailing list that you’ll need as the conference date approaches.
During the conference, provide instant messaging support from the site for 
session Q&A or any help desk issues. Post any last minute updates needed 
by a few confused participants. After the conference, use the same site pages 
to share highlights, convention notes, pictures, and YouTube videos of the 
event. If specific training was provided, presentations, transcripts, summa-
ries, and other corporate guidance can be made available on the site after the 
event is history.

396
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Newsletter Scheme
Printing newsletters is so passé. Put them online. Create your own pre-
designed template for your newsletter that you can use for future newslet-
ters. This reduces your development time the next time you compile the 
latest news.
An online newsletter also gives you more flexibility with your content over 
the traditional paper versions. You can add gadgets that interest your audi-
ence to provide interactivity. For example, you can insert a Finance gadget 
that tracks your corporate stock performance. You can even have Google 
translate the newsletter into multiple languages if necessary.
Combine your newsletter site with a Google Groups registration so that 
everyone who signs up receives the newsletter via e-mail with a link directly 
to the online version. Adding your organization’s logo to the newsletter site 
places it on every newsletter from then on without much fuss or bother on 
your part.
 
Don’t forget to archive past editions for reference purposes. In fact, create 
separate pages for each and index them with a newsletter sitemap. Naming 
each one by date makes this an easy task. If anyone needs to find something 
from an obscure past issue, he can use the built-in search tool and find the 
issue quickly.
Group or Team Project Scheme
Google simply understands collaboration. All the Google tools were made with 
sharing and teamwork in mind. Sites, Apps, Talk, Gmail, Calendar, and all the 
other Google Apps and gadgets are designed to be shared. Each can also be 
opened up to simultaneous group collaboration. This set of tools brings teams 
together to complete projects and assignments in powerful new ways.
Setting up team meeting schedules, scheduling rooms and resources, and fol-
lowing up with details is a snap when you combine Google Sites with Gmail, 
Google Calendar, and other Google Apps.
List pages can keep track of every step of a project. Spreadsheet gadgets can 
be created to keep track of a team’s budget or to create charts and graphs to 
record progress. Plus, you can use thousands of additional gadgets to keep 
track of everything from deadlines to team To-Do lists. The Google Talk and 
instant messaging features will keep the conversations rolling.

397
 Chapter 21: Ten More Ideas for Your Scheme
An Announcements page can keep everyone up-to-date. Sites pages can also 
be used to communicate to supervisors what the team is working on and how 
much progress has been made. It’s like creating your own internal advertis-
ing agency to keep people apprised and interested in the project’s progress.
Homeroom Scheme
If you’re a teacher at any grade level, Google Sites can add high-tech effi-
ciency to your communications with parents and students. For younger 
students in particular, be sure to create a page that communicates directly 
to parents about how their kids are doing and lets them know when assign-
ments are due. The Announcements template would be perfect for this task. 
You can easily include a calendar of classroom events, such as your testing 
or activities schedule. These can all be linked to a school calendar as well.
Showcasing student work for the K–8 crowd is easy with Google Sites. 
Student’s written work, such as essays and reports, can be shared from a 
Filing Cabinet. To show student artwork, scan the pieces you want to share 
and upload the images to a page created from a Web page template. You can 
even link to and display student presentations live online, particularly if they 
are using Google Apps to prepare their presentations.
For older students, create a page where students can download assignments 
and study guides, and provide a place where they can sign up for and receive 
course announcements. Don’t forget to suggest that students build sites for 
their own teamwork efforts. Check out the College Scheme ideas explained in 
more detail in Chapter 12.
Many faculty members are using Google Sites to support teacher in-service 
and schoolwide teacher support networks. Providing a place where teach-
ers can swap information and curricula, as well as privately discuss student 
progress, can facilitate school improvement. Make sure that you take full 
advantage of the security settings to preserve the confidentiality needed in a 
school environment.
Political Scheme
Whether you are organizing a political campaign for the presidency of the 
United States or managing a campaign to pass a bond to build a new library 
in your hometown, Google Sites is the answer. Create separate sites; one for 
the public campaign that voters see and another to keep campaign volun-
teers organized and in the loop.

398
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The 2008 Presidential campaign set a new standard for managing campaigns 
online. A lot can be learned by examining how the campaign involved people 
in social networking forums, publicized events, and organized the candidates’ 
answers to issues for information seekers. Here are some other ideas:
 
✓ Create and publish a calendar of campaign events.
 
✓ Use Google Checkout to collect campaign contributions.
 
✓ Create a Filing Cabinet to download issue and position papers.
 
✓ Create a gadget to track poll results.
 
✓ Create a gadget to count down to Election Day.
 
✓ Create a site to orchestrate the victory rally.
 
✓ Use a wiki to create a profile of your candidate or of your issue.
 
✓ Provide ways to contact the campaign.
 
✓ Create an online campaign store for yard signs, T-shirts, buttons, and 
bumper stickers.
 
✓ Post your campaign’s commercials or link to them on YouTube.
 
✓ Create a moderated space where voters can comment and share their 
thoughts on the issues.
 
✓ Link to other organizations that support your issue or candidate.
Investment Club Scheme
In these interesting financial times, it may be good to go online with your 
investment club info and results. Here are a few ideas:
 
✓ Use the Google Finance gadget to keep track of every portfolio in the 
club.
 
✓ Use Google Finance to do “what if” trading scenarios to see how alter-
native investment paths would have performed. Make it a contest. 
Have each club member create their own fantasy investment portfolio 
scenario and track the results. Give the winner a share of Berkshire 
Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) and a free lunch with Buffet.
 
✓ Create an RSS gadget that links you to current investment articles and 
news feeds.
 
✓ Link to CNBC or other investment sites live or link to investment 
YouTube videos.

399
 Chapter 21: Ten More Ideas for Your Scheme
 
✓ Have a wiki or comments section for club members where they can 
share their ideas and recommendations. Use the site to help members 
vote to decide what the next investment will be.
 
✓ Track the biggest movers in each sector.
 
✓ Give advice on how to protect the value of your club and your member’s 
personal investments.
 
✓ Stream Jim Cramer’s Mad Money every day.
 
✓ Don’t get into credit-default swaps.
 
✓ Don’t buy Lehman Brothers at any price.
Your Scheme Here
Oh, what the heck . . . you can do about anything you want with Sites. You 
can create a site on pumpkin carving or holiday tree-decorating ideas. Create 
a hobby site or display your photographs or your award-winning watercol-
ors. Create a site for your church or community organization. Create a site 
for the county fair. Make a wedding site for that special event, or better yet, 
create a baby site for the new arrival. Announce a graduation with Google 
Sites. There’s really no limit to the creativity. Do whatever you can think of. 
Just remember to stay away from illegal online activities. This would be a 
violation of the spirit behind Google’s mantra, “Don’t be evil.”
Bottom line; enjoy Google Sites!

Ten More Google Apps 
for Your Team
W
e know that Google Apps is going to make your team more efficient, 
streamlined, and hip. And just because you’re using the basic Google 
Apps (Sites, Docs, Calendar, Gmail, and Talk) doesn’t mean you have to stop 
there. After all, you can find numerous other free Google Apps and services 
that can help make your life easier.
So, before we send you off to build your site, we want to take a moment to tell 
you about some of our favorite Google services. We can’t list them all in this 
chapter, and Google is adding new ones all the time. For a complete list, go to 
www.google.com/options — and if you’re extra adventurous, see what’s 
bubbling in Google Labs at www.google.com/labs.
Creating a Google Account
To use most Google services, you need 
a Google Account. A Google Account is 
different from your Google Apps account, but 
you can use your Google Apps e-mail address 
to sign up for a Google Account and add some 
of the additional features that we talk about in 
this chapter. See Chapter 3 to set up a Google 
Account.

1-800-GOOG-411
This App has nothing to do with the Internet — at least, not directly. 
Google offers free phone directory assistance for local businesses. Call 1-800-
GOOG-411, and Google not only lists the most relevant businesses that you’re 
looking for, but also sends you an SMS text message with the listing you want 
and connects you to the company you choose free. You’ll be amazed at how 
good the service is. Here are the key prompts and voice commands, in order:
 
✓ What city and state? Say the city and state you want information for, 
such as “Duluth, Minnesota.”
 
✓ What business name or category? Say the name of the business that 
you’re looking for, such as “Dentist” or “John Smith.”
 
✓ Say, “Number X”: Listen to the list of results. When you hear the 
business that you want more information on, say the corresponding 
number. You don’t have to wait until the list ends. Google connects you 
automatically, or you can say one of these commands:
 
• “Details”: Listen to the full address and phone number of the 
business. It repeats the information twice, so you can make sure 
that your pen is working correctly.
 
• “Text message”: If you’re using a mobile phone, say this command 
to receive a text message with the address and phone number of 
the business.
 
✓ Say, “Go back”: Return to the previous prompt.
 
✓ Say, “Start over”: Begin your search again with the city and state.
AdWords
http://adwords.google.com
What better way can you get your message out there than to advertise on 
Google? With AdWords, you can quickly and easily set up an account and 
decide how much you want to pay for advertising. It’s a cost-per-click service, 
so you decide how many times your ad can appear and be clicked. You’re in 
control of how much you pay.

AdSense
http://adsense.google.com
AdSense is Google’s way of renting space on your Web site for advertise-
ments. You have control over the advertisement categories that appear as 
well as the color scheme. Every time your visitors click a link, you make 
money. It’s as simple as that!
Follow the tutorial on http://adsense.google.com to set up your 
account and begin making easy money.
Google Notebook
http://google.com/notebook
We love this tool. Notebook lets you take notes in your Web browser and 
keep them online and accessible from anywhere. Copy snippets of Web pages 
(including tables and images), make To Do lists, and more. For added conve-
nience, you can also download the Notebook browser plug-in and note things 
when you’re surfing the Web without having to open another window.
Google Finance
http://finance.google.com
Track your stock portfolio or follow your favorite companies from one 
convenient place. Google Finance brings information from multiple finance 
and news sites, and places them in one location. Sift through financial state-
ments, check the historical stock prices, and watch the latest videos from the 
experts. As a bonus, you can add a Google Finance gadget to your Start Page 
and see how your stocks are doing while you peruse your Gmail Inbox.
Google Product Search
www.google.com/products
Looking for a printer or vintage coffee maker? Google Product Search looks 
through a large selection of Internet stores so you don’t have to. Sort your 

404
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
results by price, and you can find the best deal around. Adding Google 
Checkout (http://checkout.google.com) to your Google Account saves 
time that you’d otherwise spend filling out forms — and it keeps your credit 
card information safe. Product Search lets you sort your results by price or 
relevance, and other users have rated the stores, so you know what you’re 
getting into.
Google Reader
www.google.com/reader
Instead of taking a lot of time to visit your favorite news sites and blogs, make 
them come to you. Google Reader helps you corral all your sources into one 
place, and it automatically updates your top stories. After you log in the first 
time, be sure to take the tour. Click the Add Subscription button on the left 
side of the screen and a textbox appears, allowing you to search for your 
favorite Web site feeds. Click the Subscribe button on the search results page 
and you’ll receive messages and articles right away.
 
Think of Google Reader as an Inbox for the Web. Rather than messages from 
people, you get articles from Web sites.
Google Maps
http://maps.google.com
Google Maps is intuitive and fun. Find addresses, locate businesses, or get 
directions from place to place. Our favorite map views include
 
✓ Street View: Get down to street level and take a panoramic tour of major 
cities. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom, and then drag the little 
yellow man onto an outlined street to see what passersby see on their 
way to work.
 
✓ Traffic: Google taps into several traffic monitoring sources to give you 
current traffic conditions. Green is good, red is bad. Google even takes 
into account bad traffic when giving you directions to your destination.
 
✓ More: New Google Maps features are added all the time. Check the 
Photos box in the list that appears to view pictures from nearby sites. 
Check the Wikipedia box to show buttons that preview articles about 
cities, landmarks, or other points of interest.

405
 Chapter 22: Ten More Google Apps for Your Team
 
✓ Map: Quickly find your way around with the default map view. Search 
the map for local businesses, get directions from one place to another, 
print your maps, or e-mail them to your friends.
 
✓ Satellite: See a bird’s-eye view of your local shopping center or historic 
statue. When you click the Satellite button, you can also check the Show 
Labels box to see street names on the map.
 
✓ Terrain: See the world in topographical form, including all the nooks 
and crannies of the Grand Canyon or your ski resort.
 
There are some hidden features for getting directions to a place on the map. 
Right-click on the map your starting point and choose Directions from Here 
from the menu that appears. Then right-click your destination and choose 
Directions to Here. To customize your route, drag the blue directions line to 
any other road or point along the way that you’d like to visit. While you drag 
the line, a tooltip appears that shows you how long your new route will be.
Don’t forget to check out the My Maps tab to add your favorite spots, draw 
borders, and shade in areas.
Google Pack
http://pack.google.com
Google Pack brings together all the free software that you need (and none 
that you don’t) in one easy-to-use installer. These programs include Web 
tools, Internet security programs, and other productivity software. Pack even 
keeps your software up-to-date automatically. Here are our favorite Google 
Pack programs:
 
✓ Google Earth: Take Google Maps to the next level with a 3D atlas of the 
world. Zoom into famous landmarks, search for your house, see commu-
nity photos of places, and globe-trot without leaving your home.
 
✓ Google Desktop: Add Google Search to your computer desktop. Google 
Desktop helps you quickly find documents, images, and music on your 
computer as easily as you find pages on the Internet.
 
✓ Picasa: Organize and edit your photos with simple yet powerful tools. 
Picasa also has an online counterpart called Picasa Web Albums 
(http://picasaweb.google.com), which lets you post your photos 
into your own online gallery with one click.
 
✓ StarOffice: For documents that need a little more oomph than Google 
Docs provides, try this free alternative to Microsoft Office. It includes all 
the tools that you need to create documents, spreadsheets, presenta-
tions, drawings, and databases.

Google Translate
http://translate.google.com
Get yourself out of a pinch by using Google Translate. With support for over 
20 languages and the ability to translate entire Web sites in a single bound, 
Translate saves the day time and again. Go to http://translate.google.
com and click one of the tabs along the top. Here’s how they work:
 
✓ Text and Web: Enter a word, phrase, or paragraph in the Original Text 
textbox at the top of the page or enter a Web address in the Translate a 
Web Page textbox at the bottom of the page. Click the arrow to the right 
of the appropriate language textbox and choose the language combina-
tion that you want to translate from/to from the drop-down list that 
appears. Then click the Translate button. After a moment, a translation 
appears on the right side of the screen. Web pages will load in their 
entirety in the same window.
 
 Google Translate, like other automated translation services, can do a 
decent job of translating basic text. However, many times, you get a 
quite literal and not very accurate translation, which can be funny or 
just plain confusing. If you need to translate an important document, 
make sure that you have a native speaker read through the translation 
before you send the document. (You don’t want to inadvertently insult 
someone with an inaccurate translation.)
 
✓ Translated Search: Google Translate can help you find a search term in 
Web pages that are written in a language other than English.
 
✓ Dictionary: Use this language translation dictionary when you’re 
stumped by a foreign word you encounter. Enter a word in the Enter 
Word textbox and choose a language translation in the drop-down menu 
to the right; the foreign language equivalent appears.
 
✓ Tools: Add a Google Translate gadget to your Web page so that your vis-
itors can translate your page in a flash. Simply choose your page’s lan-
guage and then copy the HTML code that appears in the box below Step 
2 into your page. If you translate pages often, make life simple — add 
one of the translate buttons listed at the bottom of the screen to your 
browser’s toolbar by clicking the link and dragging it to your browser’s 
bookmarks or favorites bar. Then when you visit a site, simply click the 
button to translate the page instantly.
