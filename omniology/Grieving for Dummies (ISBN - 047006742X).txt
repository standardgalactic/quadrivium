About the Author
Greg Harvey, the author of a slew of For Dummies books running the gamut
from Excel For Dummies to The Origins of Tolkien’s Middle-Earth For Dummies,
has had a long career of teaching business people the use of IBM PC, Windows,
and Macintosh software application programs. From 1983 to 1988, he con-
ducted hands-on computer software training for corporate business users
with a variety of training companies. From 1988 to 1992, he taught university
classes in Lotus 1-2-3 and Introduction to Database Management Technology
(using dBASE) in the Department of Information Systems at Golden Gate
University in San Francisco.
In 2000, after starting graduate school, Greg began volunteering at Maitri, a
15-bed AIDS patient care facility located in San Francisco, California. As part
of the Masters program, he took courses in Death and Dying and as part of
his Doctorate program did his comprehensive exams in Death and Dying in
Western and Eastern culture and religion. In 2003, he also received volunteer
and group facilitator training at the Center for Attitudinal Healing in Sausalito,
California, and began volunteering for their Home and Hospital Visitor pro-
gram. In 2006, he received his PhD in Comparative Philosophy and Religion
with a concentration on Asian Studies from the California Institute of Integral
Studies in San Francisco, California.
Greg is currently a member of the American Academy of Bereavement, from
which he received Bereavement Facilitator training, and the Association for
Death Education and Counseling (ADEC). He is also a patient care volunteer
for Maitri AIDS Hospice in San Francisco, Sutter VNA and Hospice in Santa
Rosa and a patient care, bereavement, and vigil volunteer at Hospice By The
Bay in Marin County and San Francisco.

Dedication
“For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it seems to those whose boat is on
the running stream.”
—Legolas to Gimli upon saying farewell to Lothlórien: The Fellowship of the
Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien
This book is written especially for my life partner, Christopher Aiken, who
continually inspires me to live each moment fully.
This book is dedicated to all the people and their families whom I’ve been
privileged to support as a volunteer (and who always to teach me so much
about life and love), along with the following fine and outstanding individuals:
Helen Rose, Jerry and Jo Ann, Mike and Linda, Susan Dolder, Tara, Shandy,
Maggie, Kimma, and Rudy, Carol, Diane, Hilda, Judith, Lynne, Penni, and
Sharon.
It’s also dedicated to the memory of the following loved ones — both my own
and those of many folks who supported this project — lost to us in this life
but still found very much alive in our hearts:
Shane W. Gearing, Kenneth H. Harvey, M. Faye Harvey, Clyde B. Harvey, Olive
Harvey, Charles (Pop) Pounds, Gertrude Pounds, Walter Harvey, Cornellia
Harvey, Herschel Harvey, Edna Harvey, Paul Harvey, Lenora M. Harvey, Fern
Grosvernor, Otis Grosvernor, Charles (Jr.) Pounds, Karen Stewardson, Penny,
Juno, Nicky, Joshua, Chauncey, Ginger, Kelly, Seung Sahn Nim, Larry Peterson,
Philip L. Manly, Hans, George H. Feltman, Mary Catherine Campbell, Margaret
Rose O’Neil, Amada Lujan Rubio, Maximo G. Rubio, Marilyn Schlesinger,
Dayton Schlesinger, Merlin, Pootey, Sophie, Pokey, Lucky, Scott Dorffman,

Foreword
H
ere you are holding this book, so maybe you’re not a dummy after all:
What you’re starting to realize is that life involves loss. Perhaps you’ve
experienced the death of a loved one, or someone you love has and you want
to help. Now what?
Different parts of the world look at this unsettling fact, well, in lots of differ-
ent ways. But one thing is sure: Loss is here to stay as long as you stick around
for this wild ride we call life. So one of the things that is real too is this stuff
called grief. Though this fact is far from universally acknowledged, I’m here
to tell you that grief is a natural, universal response to loss. You may be hold-
ing this book because you’re finding it harder than usual to live your life,
maybe even feeling like you’re going a little (or a lot) crazy. All these other
folks are walking around like nothing big has happened, and here you are
maybe thinking something really big has happened and you don’t know what
to do with all the yuck you’re feeling — the numbness, shock, overwhelming
rage, waves of sobbing, relief, disbelief. Maybe you’re not even sure if you can
go on or, on a really bad day, whether you even want to. It’s normal!
As Greg says, illness, accidents, incidents of violence, dying, and death aren’t
as cool to talk about around the water cooler happy hour as the Super Bowl,
24, American Idol, stock market ups and downs, the latest electronics, and so
forth. Let’s face it: Loss and grief just aren’t sexy. As a matter of fact, they’re
taboo, the old clichéd elephant in the room, and there isn’t much opportu-
nity for someone like you to learn what to do when you lose someone (or
when you want to help someone else who’s suffered a loss). You may feel it’s
like an earthquake in your life, and not only don’t you know what to do, you
feel ashamed and wonder what’s wrong with you if you can’t suck it up, get
over it, and move on.
Hang in there. This grief thing is doable, and here are a few tips right off: Take
it one day at a time (or one hour or one minute or one second), be gentle with
yourself by cutting yourself some slack, take as good care of yourself as you
can (eat, rest, take a walk around the block, get some respite from the grief),
and accept that if ever in your life you need support, it’s around a profound
loss, so find the strength to ask for some. The Buddha once said that one
could travel all around the world and never find anyone more worthy of com-
passion than oneself. Yeah, that means even you. You’ll discover that grief
can affect us in a global way: It has emotional, physical, spiritual, mental, and
behavioral aspects. You’ll also discover that grieving is a process, it takes

time, and, oh dear, no one can fix it. You do need to go through it. And no one
can tell you how long that will take. One of the most common things I hear is
“This is hard and painful and I don’t like it; so when am I going to feel better?”
I wish I could say that you’ll feel better on July 2 at 3:30 in the afternoon.
Unfortunately, the real answer is that grieving is a nonlinear process and will
take however long it takes. The grief is going to shift and get easier, even
though right now that seems impossible. This book has lots of information
that will help you make sense of this rollercoaster ride you’re on.
In our culture, more than a few of us are uncomfortable around grieving
people because they remind us that we’re mortal, that things change, that loss
is inevitable; it might even be catching, and we don’t want to believe it can
happen to us. For you wonderful people who still want to help someone you
love through their grief and feel helpless because you don’t know what to do
or say, you’re not alone. Greg has lots of good ideas and also alerts us to some
common clichés that are less than helpful. The best suggestions I can offer
are to relax, know you can’t fix it, and be the best nonjudgmental listener you
can be. We often underestimate the gift of a loving presence: our own.
Loss is a powerful teacher. The more you can be present with what is going
on with you, the better off you’ll be in the long run. We have a great capacity
to learn and grow, to love and be kind. So go ahead, get as comfortable as you
can, perhaps put your feet up, and start to read this thoughtful and caring
book. May you find comfort and peace.

Introduction
U
nfortunately, grieving the loss of a loved one isn’t an optional human
activity. Only those who never get the opportunity to love or who die
too young are spared this uniquely painful experience. Yet despite its wide-
spread nature, grieving is far from understood and very far from being appre-
ciated in any way in modern society.
For the most part, grieving probably makes us so uncomfortable because 
it’s a concrete reminder of our human mortality and the great fear of death.
However, that isn’t the sole reason that grieving is so misunderstood that it’s
barely tolerated and completely underrated; the other big reason for under-
valuing grief is that loss of any kind runs completely counter to the major driv-
ing force of modern life, which is the idea of gain. People are driven to always
be gaining something, whether it’s an increase of material possessions,
power, and control, or knowledge and skill.
In this book, I attempt to counter this significantly shortsighted attitude
toward grieving by presenting it neither as the most tragic process nor the
most uplifting one that you can undergo in life. Rather, I see grieving as being
somewhere right in the middle of these two extremes.
On the one hand, grieving is truly a tremendously difficult and trying process;
it’s one that seems to have the power to crush people with its overwhelming
emotions. On the other hand, however, grieving is a tremendously transfor-
mative process; it’s one that seems to have the power to teach people more
about appreciating love than they ever thought was possible in life.
My sincere wish is that this little book on grieving is able to shed light on
what, up to now, you may have considered a totally mysterious and forebod-
ing process. In the last analysis, grieving is nothing more or less than finding
the way that you can come to grips with and abide the permanent separation
of a loved one. And in taking this solemn and sacred journey, it’s my great
hope that you come to a deeper appreciation of the love you shared and,
instead of seeing that love as forever lost, you come to an understanding that
enables you to keep that love alive in your life all the rest of your days.

About This Book
This book is comprehensive in the sense that it addresses all types of pro-
found loss — specifically defined as the loss of a loved one that results in
extended and serious grieving. Therefore, the book doesn’t address the grief
that comes from suffering any other kinds of loss such as losing your home
as a result of some sort of disaster, losing your job, or breaking up with a
lover (all of which are traumatic in various ways and produce their own
levels of grief).
With one exception, profound loss involves the death of the loved one as the
catalyst for the grief and the cause of your grieving. The sole exception is
divorce, in which you lose a spouse and grieve the loss without the trauma of
your partner’s death.
In this book, I approach the process of grieving the loss of a loved one from
the following perspectives:
 Grieving is a natural human response to profound loss — it isn’t some
sort of mental disorder or other malady that requires curing.
 People grieve in their own highly individual ways on their own personal
timetables.
 In most cases, grieving does not require any kind of medical interven-
tion, although it can benefit from support from family and friends as well
as professional grief counselors and support groups.
 Grieving can be facilitated through a combination of efforts on the part
of the person suffering the loss and outside support.
 Grieving comes to an end when the person suffering the loss is able to
make sense of the loss and incorporate it into the rest of his life.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is written specifically for two kinds of people: those who are in the
midst of grieving the loss of a loved one and those who, as close friends,
want to support these people in their grieving.
If you’re grieving a loss of a loved one, I’ll bet some or all of the following
assumptions apply to you in your present situation:
 Your emotions are very volatile and all over the place.
 You feel pretty alone and hopeless during the worst times.
2
Grieving For Dummies 

 You’re worried that all this emotional upheaval will be more than you
can handle.
 You’re concerned that you’ll never see the end of this emotional
upheaval.
If you’re supporting a close friend who’s grieving, I’d venture that some or all
of these assumptions apply to you:
 You very much want to help your bereaved friend but are very uncertain
what you can do in this situation to help.
 You’re not all that comfortable with death and aren’t sure if your discom-
fort will hinder or prevent you from being an effective source of support.
 You’re unsure how best to approach someone who’s grieving, and you’re
afraid of saying the wrong thing.
 Your experience with grieving your own profound losses is fairly limited
or nonexistent.
If you find that some or most (or even all) of my foolish assumptions apply to
you as the person grieving or a supporting friend, then I’m sure that you’ll find
some very helpful information and advice in the chapters of this book. These
are the very conjectures that I address throughout Grieving For Dummies.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re looking for just need-to-know information and want to skip a few text
that isn’t essential, you can easily ignore any sidebars (the gray shaded
boxes) and paragraphs tagged by the Technical Stuff icon. Sidebars contain
tangents and anecdotes that aren’t germane to the main discussion, and
Technical Stuff paragraphs present minutia that not everyone is going to be
interested in.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are religiously followed throughout the text in the
hopes that they make the text easier to decipher:
 The masculine singular pronoun in all its forms (he, his, and him) is
used throughout the text when talking about people in general. (I hate
playing the he/she pronoun game.)
 Web addresses appear in monofont.

 New terms appear in italic type when first introduced in the text.
 Numbered steps and the main parts of bulleted items appear in boldface
type.
How This Book Is Organized
You can use Grieving For Dummies in one of two ways: Pick and choose the
topics that look like they pertain to your particular situation and will be of
the most help, or read the book from start to finish.
Assuming that you’re not all that interested in the subject of grieving and 
that your time and energy are limited, I suggest that you go with the pick-and-
choose method. To help you more quickly locate the topics of interest to you,
I summarize the contents of the book’s five parts in the following sections.
Part I: Contemplating Grief
Part I contains the nitty-gritty on loss and grief. Chapter 1 introduces the 
relationship between loss and grief and the factors in modern life that make
grieving a little more difficult than it has to be. Chapter 2 presents an investi-
gation on how the manner of death impacts the grieving process. Chapters 3
through 6 and Chapters 8 and 9 cover particular types of losses: parents,
spouses and partners, siblings, children, friends, and pets. Chapter 7 deals
with the very special topic of how children typically deal with profound loss
and how best to support them through their grieving.
Part II: Experiencing Grief
Part II contains practical information on how to deal with the emotional
upheaval that grieving tends to bring. Chapter 10 is the grieving person’s
first-aid kit for dealing with the emotional upsurges and other problems
during the initial, acute phase of grieving. Chapter 13, on the other hand, is
the first-aid kit for those supporting a grieving friend; it’s full of advice on
what you can do to help and how to avoid hindering this process at all cost.
Chapter 11 investigates the common stages of grieving as they’ve been
defined by various top-notch experts working in the field of human bereave-
ment. Chapter 12 then deals with the subject of complicated or problematic
grieving by investigating the factors that indicate your grieving process is
either temporarily stuck in a particular stage or is off track and in some real
trouble.

Grieving For Dummies 

Part III: Healing Grief
Part III contains more practical information about the grieving process and
how you can help it along. Chapter 14 takes a long look at ways that you can
fully and freely express and release your feelings of grief. Chapter 15 then
looks at the physical aspects of grief with an eye toward releasing some of
the frustration and sorrow through a wide array of different physical activi-
ties. Chapter 16 examines challenges that holidays and anniversaries present
to you after suffering the death of a loved one; it contains suggestions on
strategies to adopt to help you survive these special and now particularly
painful days.
Part IV: Appreciating Grief
Part IV looks at the end of the grieving process and the factors that may help
bring it to a successful close. Chapter 17 examines the spiritual side of grief
by investigating the ways that major religious and cultural traditions assign
meaning to death. Chapter 18 then investigates the vital topic of giving mean-
ing to the loss and becoming reconciled to it so that you can successfully
incorporate it into the rest of your life. Chapter 19 concludes this part on
appreciating grief with an examination of the many ways that you can com-
memorate the one you’ve lost and grieved so that you can keep the love you
shared alive in your life.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a smorgasbord of practical tidbits for those grieving and
those supporting them. Chapter 20 contains my top-ten list of crass clichés
and platitudes about grief and grieving. This chapter not only tells you what
the clichés are but also why they’re so unhelpful to folks grieving a profound
loss (even when they’re partially or completely true). Chapter 21 contains my
top-ten list of things you should do to help support someone you care about
who’s currently grieving a profound loss. Chapter 22 contains a list of ten
online resources that you can consult to get more information about grieving
as well as direct support from other people grieving a similar loss. Chapter 23
concludes this part and, indeed, the entire book with ten meditations related
to grieving. These are guided contemplations that you can do as a bereaved
person to appreciate your loss and alleviate some of the grief associated 
with it.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
The following four icons are used throughout this book to highlight informa-
tion worthy of some sort of special attention:
This icon indicates a noteworthy tidbit of information to keep in mind about
grieving or grief.
This icon indicates a suggested course of action that may help facilitate your
grieving or the support of someone who is grieving.
This icon indicates a course of action you may want to avoid — it may inter-
fere with grieving or make it more difficult.
This icon indicates some nonessential information about grieving or grief
that you may find helpful nonetheless.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that you can jump in and start wherever you need
to; you really don’t need to start at the beginning and work your way through
each chapter.
If you’re currently in the throes of grieving the loss of a loved one, I suggest
that you go directly to Chapter 10, which addresses doing your own grief
crisis management. Then look up the chapter in Part I for the particular type
of loss you’ve suffered before finding other chapters that seem pertinent and
potentially helpful.
If you’re supporting a close friend who’s grieving the loss of a loved one, I
suggest that you go to Chapter 13, which covers helping someone you care
about who’s grieving. Then check out Chapter 21 on ten things you can do to
support someone else before you go about finding other chapters with infor-
mation that seems relevant to your friend’s particular situation.

B
efore you can find a way to alleviate the pain of grieving, you need to
stop for a moment and find out just what grief is and what makes it tick.
Our pace of living has become so frenzied that we have less and less time for
stopping to investigate anything, let alone something such as grief that doesn’t
carry the best of reputations. Nevertheless, to have a fighting chance of pro-
cessing your own grief with a modicum of grace or helping someone you care
about process his grief in a like manner, it’s imperative that you understand
the process known as grieving, particularly the nature of grief, the close asso-
ciation between grief and loss, and the factors in society that complicate the
natural response to grief.
A few factors tend to complicate grieving:
 The highly competitive nature of modern society, which has an
extremely low tolerance for loss and even less patience for grieving
 Ignorance about the grief process due in large part to a set of societal
norms that stress thinking over feeling and that make the subject of
death taboo
 Our own inability to find meaning in loss
This chapter looks at all three of these factors along with ways you can miti-
gate their influence as you and people you care about try to come to terms
with grief.

Grieving as a Natural Response to Loss
Here are a few working (nonclinical) definitions for three interrelated terms:
grief, loss, and grieving. These definitions are designed to give you something
to hang your hat on in subsequent discussions about grieving and to show
how closely interconnected the terms are.
 Grief refers to the feelings that arise when you suffer a loss in your life.
 Loss refers to a breaking of a bond you’ve formed with a significant
person, place, thing, or idea (including beliefs) in your life.
 Grieving refers to the process of acknowledging the loss, experiencing
the grief that the loss produces, and incorporating the loss into the rest
of your life.
Grief as an emotional response
Because grief has to do with feelings, it’s primarily an emotional response,
and emotions, by their very nature, are often quite volatile and unpre-
dictable. The emotions associated with grief, such as anger, sadness, and
fear, are ones that we generally consider negative, and as a result, we do
everything we can to avoid them (thus my deliberate choice to use the
phrase “suffer a loss” rather than the more neutral “experience a loss”). To
be blunt, grief, by its very nature, is painful, and the grief that arises from a
great loss can often — too often — be excruciating. (As a lovely staff grief
counselor at my hospice emphasized in our Bereavement Volunteer training,
we often need to affirm with the people we’re attending that “Yes, it hurts just
that much!”)
Loss as it relates to connection
When it comes to the definition of loss, I need to point out a couple of things.
First, the bond you have with the person or thing lost is most often the result
of a network of associations and relationships formed over time. Most of the
time, these associations are positive, but because the bonds are often com-
plex, they can include negative associations as well. Second, because the
extent of grief depends upon the strength of the bond you’ve formed and the
degree of significance of the loss, a profound loss is necessarily one in which
you’ve developed a strong bond and which has high significance for you.
This book deals solely with profound losses of loved ones and the grieving
process required to incorporate losses of such a magnitude into one’s life.
10
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Grieving as an involved process
The following corollaries regarding the connection of loss to grief and grief to
grieving generally hold true:
 The stronger the bond you made with the person you lost and the
greater the significance that person holds in your life, the more pro-
found your grief over the loss.
Although the bond has been broken, the significance of the person you’ve
lost generally remains present in your life. In fact, you may actually find
that his significance increases after the loss. If you find that the signifi-
cance of a person fades as soon as or shortly after your relationship with
him is over, then you really aren’t grieving the loss (you’re probably just a
little bummed out about the termination of the relationship).
 The more profound the grief over the loss, the more involved your
grieving process.
When I speak about involved grieving, I’m talking about a process that
usually doesn’t adhere to a linear timeline or anything like a recogniz-
able schedule and may never include what’s commonly referred to as
“closure” (a term that I thoroughly detest but that continues to appear
in bereavement literature nonetheless).
I purposely don’t refer to involved grieving as complex or complicated
grief because that’s a technical term in the death, dying, and grieving
profession (which goes by the $10 name thanatology, from the Greek for
the study of death and dying). As a clinical term, complicated grief
refers to a grieving process that gets really stuck in some way because of
a deep inability to acknowledge, experience, or integrate the loss. An
example of complicated grief is a mother who keeps the room of the
child she lost 25 years ago exactly the way it was at the time of the
death. Chances are good that this mom’s having an extremely hard time
acknowledging and incorporating the loss and maybe even experiencing
the pain of the loss. Most often, complicated grief requires and benefits
from psychological counseling. (I discuss seeking psychological help in
Chapter 14.) The good news is that most people, even when their griev-
ing is really messy and they get a little stuck in some aspect of it, aren’t
really experiencing complicated grief (it just feels that way at the time).
When it comes to the definition of grieving, the three tasks that I single out as
being integral parts of this process are
1. Acknowledge the loss.
This task can run the gamut from accepting the awful truth of it to finally
facing up to its lasting impact on your life.
2. Experience the grief the loss produces.
11
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

This task can run the gamut from suffering the wave of emotions it
brings up to contemplating its influence on your life.
3. Incorporate the loss into the remainder of your life.
This task can run the gamut from simply surviving the grief produced by
the loss to fully integrating the loss into your everyday life (something
that professional grief counselors sometimes refer to as “creating a new
normal”).
Keep in mind that for some of the most profound losses, the grieving may
never come to a complete end. Although you may finish acknowledging the
loss for the most part and may seldom suffer the pain it engenders, you may
continue to be involved in the intricate dance of fully incorporating the loss
in your life all the rest of your days.
Grieving as a Totally Personal Process
Zen Buddhism has a story (and I apologize in advance for its rather off-color
nature, but Zen does tend to deal with the concrete and, at times, is inten-
tionally quite graphic) about a master whose student asks him about how to
go about getting enlightened (presumably when both are side by side at
whatever serves as the monastery latrine). The student is then completely
surprised when his master responds to his question by starting to urinate
and then saying, “Such a small thing, but only I can do it for myself.” Grieving
may not fall into the category of such a small thing (but then neither does
becoming enlightened), but it’s right in there among those things that you
can do only for yourself (although not necessarily all by your lonesome).
The point is that no one else can spare you the pain that accompanies the
grief your loss engenders no matter how desperately that person wants to
alleviate your suffering. In fact, even if it were somehow possible to fix some-
body else’s grief, it’s entirely debatable whether or not this would be a good
idea. And the reason for this stance has absolutely nothing to do with some
hackneyed cliché about how “that which does not kill you makes you strong”
or some notion about grieving as a noble growth process that enriches the
soul — don’t worry, you’ll never hear such things from me.
Although it may be tempting when I’m on the floor doubled up by the intense
pain of my grief, I’d tell you not to try to fix my grief from a profound loss
because in trying to fix my grief, you inadvertently negate my loss by devalu-
ing the bond I had with the person I’ve lost. Consequently, you discount his
significance in my life.
12
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

If you’re a parent suffering a family loss that affects your children, you may
well feel that it’s a natural part of your parental duties to protect your chil-
dren from the pain of their grief over this loss. Although witnessing their pain
may add notably to your own grief, it’s really important that your children be
allowed to do their own grieving. See Chapter 7 for information on how pro-
found losses can affect children and suggestions of how you can go about
helping your children through this difficult and trying period without also
impeding their own grieving.
Some factors that influence grieving
Although each of us must do our own grieving, this doesn’t mean that we all
do it in a completely different manner. Grief is certainly idiosyncratic inas-
much as each loss is personal and the grief it produces surely varies with the
strength of the bond to the person lost and his significance in one’s life. Never-
theless, for the vast majority of people, the process of grieving profound
losses shares some common characteristics (as discussed in Part II) that
span gender, generations, and even cultural differences to a certain extent.
Certain factors affect the way in which you grieve a profound loss in your life,
including:
 How naturally outgoing or introspective you tend to be
 How easily you express your feelings
 How well integrated you are into a circle of friends, your family, and the
local community
 How confident you are
 How secure your worldview is
Many social scientists would consider the first items in this list to be gender
based, pointing out that, traditionally, most societies attempt to socialize
13
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss
Can you share another’s grief?
The question sometimes arises as to whether or
not another person who shares your loss can
share in your grief. Given the way I define grief
as a personal response to loss (even a com-
monly shared one), my answer is a definite
“No.” Of course, people grieve together when
they’re a family facing the loss of a family
member or when they come together to mourn
a regional or national tragedy, but each person
is grieving in his own way, albeit in response to
a shared loss.

breadwinners and their women to be more introspective to fulfill their roles
as the nurturers and caregivers. As a result of this overt attempt to socialize
men and women differently, on the whole, women tend to be able to express
their feelings more easily than men.
Whether or not you accept this gender-based viewpoint, you need to keep in
mind that many different traditional gender roles currently are being chal-
lenged in societies all over the globe; more and more, the time-honored roles
allotted to men and women are being interchanged. In addition, even where
people accept and follow conventional gender roles, the actual degree to
which a man or woman is extroverted or introverted and able or unable to
openly express his or her feelings is still quite personal. (See the “What to do
when feelings aren’t your forte” section, later in this chapter, for a few sug-
gestions on approaching grief for folks who tend to hold their emotions
inside and in check.)
It’s pretty easy to understand how the last three factors in the list — how
well integrated you are into your society, how self-confident you are, and how
secure you are in your worldview — can mitigate your grieving by offering
you indispensable external and internal support throughout your time of
need. Be aware, however, that a loss that occurs in one of these areas or fun-
damentally disrupts one of them can greatly intensify your grieving process
and make it more involved. For example:
 Losing the person who functions as primary head of your immediate
family, such as your mother or father, could well result in an inability of
the remaining family members to act as a cohesive unit that’s mutually
supporting, thus making this loss all the more difficult to integrate into
your life.
 Suffering a catastrophic physical loss, such as the loss of your eyesight
or your limbs, could well negatively impact your self-confidence in ways
that ensure your grieving will be more complex and involved.
 Suffering an inexplicably tragic loss, such as the loss of a child, could
well shatter your worldview by undermining your belief in God, thus
making a tremendously arduous grieving process all the more grueling
because you don’t have the support and solace of your accustomed reli-
gious beliefs.
Everyone has a right to his or her grief
Each of us has a right to our grief because the bond that we cultivated and
shared with the person now lost to us is entirely worthy of grieving. I believe
quite firmly that, should you somehow be prevented from grieving or choose
not to grieve a profound loss in your life, you run a much greater risk of
14
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

becoming embittered by that loss. Obviously, the disenchantment that neces-
sarily accompanies such bitterness benefits no one in the long run, even if
bypassing the grief appears more convenient in the short term.
I recognize that grief isn’t convenient for us or for those around us (I have a
great deal more to say on this point; see the section “Grief as a nuisance,”
later in this chapter). I also understand that grief is often seen as quite scary
because it runs counter to all notions (or are they delusions?) of control. But
I also realize that grieving is a basic part of being human, and, like it or not,
you need to engage in the process for as long as it takes. In my view, we all
owe that much to the people we’ve lost as well to our own well-being. (You
can come out of hiding now. I’ve gotten down off my soapbox.)
Dealing with Loss in a Highly
Competitive World
Grieving is hard enough on its own without the complication of a society that
has very little patience or time for loss of any kind. Given the emphasis — some
may say overemphasis — on winning and achieving success in all aspects of
modern society, it’s no wonder that loss carries such a poor reputation.
Loss is an inescapable part of life. When it’s relegated to such a low status in
society, the grief that necessarily accompanies it also is consigned to that
netherworld. As a result, when untoward circumstances hand you a profound
loss that places you squarely in the grips of grieving, you’re burdened not
only with the pain of the grief itself but also with the onus that society places
on loss.
The impact of competition on grief
“Winners never quit, and quitters never win.” How many of these kinds of
platitudes about “the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat” can you name?
It seems that there’s no end to such banalities when it comes to loss, which,
after all is said and done, is just another four-letter word in today’s society.
It’s one thing to use winning as a motivating force for achieving goals and
dreams; it’s quite another to make it into the be-all and end-all of life. The
spirit of winning at all costs seems to permeate all aspects of society —
school, sports, business, love, war, and, last and always least, politics. In this
highly competitive environment, loss becomes a fate worse than death (if you
pardon my pun).
15
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

It’s really not our fault that we’re so inept at dealing with grief (both our own
and that of people we care about). After all, we live in a secular society that’s
highly adept at training us how to acquire and refine the cognitive skills
needed to become successful in a highly competitive society. We receive no
instruction on how to suffer defeat gracefully, cooperate fully with one
another, and express and release our feelings.
With no role models for grieving available, people have a very difficult (if not
impossible) time judging whether or not the cascade of extreme feelings —
ranging from anger to depression to despondency — they experience is
normal. I can’t map out in advance all the feelings that a grieving person will
experience during his grief process, but when the people close to you who
are also grieving the same loss appear to have none of the same feelings that
you do, you may question whether or not your grief has unhinged you.
It may not surprise you that one of the most common questions that grief
counselors are asked initially by the people they see is “Am I going crazy?”
The answer is a quick and unequivocal “No.” Although you may never guess
it by the outward appearance of a typical grieving person, the sky-high level
and all-over-the-map range of emotions that most people experience after a
profound loss is entirely normal.
Few people have an adequate sense of what grief typically looks and feels
like, and most don’t comprehend that grieving profound losses isn’t an
optional part of living (like getting married and having children) but rather is
a sure bet for which it’s never too soon to be prepared.
Although we mostly associate an exaggerated emphasis on winning with the
realms of achieving power and acquiring material goods, I’ve also seen it rear
its ugly head in spiritual communities where winning is equated with attain-
ing enlightenment or achieving some sort of sainthood. Unfortunately, com-
petition is alive and well and thriving in the both the secular and sacred
worlds.
The impact on grieving of negative 
attitudes toward loss
The idea that loss is somehow deserved negatively impacts your acceptance
of grief by making grief often appear as something shameful; it insinuates that
the loss that generates this grief somehow reflects badly on you. In its most
extreme form, this viewpoint gives rise to the not-so-subtle suggestion that
the loss is somehow the result of your own doing, justified by some sort of
failing on your part or on the part of the loved one you’ve lost.
The worst example of this addlebrained thinking occurs in religious circles
when seemingly well-meaning people or religious leaders indicate that losses
16
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

from disease, natural disasters, or untimely death are divine punishment for
sinful activities (see my discussion of the biblical Book of Job in the section
“When bad things happen to good people,” later in this chapter, for the clas-
sic example of this type of thinking in religious literature) or the comeup-
pance of bad karma from this or a previous life.
A similar sentiment is expressed when people insinuate that a chronic dis-
ease such as cancer has to be the ill person’s fault in some way, either as the
result of an unhealthy lifestyle or activity or negative attitude or thinking.
Such people regard any and all protestations to the contrary as suspect and
continue to ignore the contributions of environmental and hereditary factors
(over which we exercise little or no control) to the person’s condition.
Maintaining these narrow and unconstructive viewpoints simply may be
attempts by otherwise well-meaning people to make sense of suffering in the
world and to shield themselves against loss (assuming that they have and
continue to lead blameless lives). Holding such perspectives, however, is
fraught with danger because the day may dawn (heaven forbid) when the
doctor hands one of these people a severe diagnosis, a natural disaster visits
his neighborhood, or someone in his family suddenly dies out of turn. This
person’s not only left bereft with his grief but also is forced to deal with the
very uncomfortable notion that either his beliefs regarding divine punish-
ment and bad karma turned out to be really unproductive safeguards or he
has some serious explaining to do about his own past behavior!
Grief as a nuisance
The highly competitive nature of modern society can also negatively impact
you by turning your grieving process into a veritable nuisance, for which
very few people have adequate patience. (If thus far you’ve been so blessed
that you haven’t suffered a profound loss, you haven’t had the extreme dis-
pleasure of meeting up with this kind of impatience.)
All too soon (for you, at least), you may find that dear friends and seemingly
caring family members are done with your grief and therefore expect you to be
done with it as well. In subtle and some not-so-subtle ways, they start suggest-
ing that it’s time for you to move on by taking whatever course would seem-
ingly assuage the pain of your particular loss, such as starting to date again,
visiting the animal shelter, considering trying to conceive again, or adopting.
Friends and family no longer have time to hear your stories about the loss
and the one you’re grieving, and they no longer have patience for what they
consider to be your intense mood swings, your overly developed sensibili-
ties, and your need to wallow (their words, not mine) in your feelings. They
may even start avoiding you, and, if you’re really unfortunate, they may go so
far as to temporarily or, in some extreme cases, permanently break off their
relationships with you.
17
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

For the most part, these people mean well. They sincerely want to see you
get through your grief with as little pain as possible (just as long as you do it
according to their timetable). Unfortunately, they’re usually operating from
ignorance about the nature of the grieving process. For the most part, people
have no idea that grieving a profound loss is necessarily and quite normally a
lengthy process. For example, some studies suggest that five years is the
average time for grieving a profound loss such as the death of a spouse and
that grieving the death of a child may take even longer.
Each person grieves slightly differently. It doesn’t matter whether your griev-
ing process takes longer or shorter than what’s considered average or the
norm for your type of loss — the important thing is that you’re able to take
the opportunity to grieve as completely as you need to.
Even when the people around you are aware from their own losses that grief
has no quick fix and tends to want to take its own sweet time, they still may
want you to get through your grief in short order. If they were forced to
abbreviate their grieving, they naturally figure that if they could do it, you
can do it, too. The only trouble is that they may only think that they’ve
grieved. The necessities of life coupled with society’s pressure to move on as
quickly as possible can easily conspire to interrupt a person’s natural griev-
ing cycle. It’s entirely possible that they got through their grieving in such
crack time because they abandoned the process midstream. In this situation,
your grieving is particularly problematic because it may trigger their unfin-
ished grieving processes, giving them all the more incentive to get you over
your grief as quickly as possible.
You may find that your grieving process unnerves some of the people you’re
close to in your life (especially if you’re rather expressive with your feelings).
You may find yourself in the uncomfortable role of a pariah within your circle
of friends or family. Most of the time, this change occurs because your loss
and grief threatens the other folks’ naïve notions about how life works (or
should work). Your grief also may trigger unresolved grief over losses in
another person’s life (thus, it just cuts too close). If you see this kind of change
happening, you have very little choice but to seek out people who stand out-
side of your circle and who can be with you without triggering their own issues
with grief (see Chapter 14 for suggestions on how to locate such people).
Winning and losing: Two 
faces of the same coin
“Heads you win, and tails you lose” is a common saying. I particularly like it
because it points outs very clearly and concretely that the winning (joy) and
losing (grief) are just two sides of the very same coin. This image underscores
how these two pairs of opposites are necessarily and completely conjoined
(unless you can somehow conceive of a one-sided coin).
18
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

These pairs of opposites are correlative, which means that when you’re facing
the side of the coin with loss and grief staring you in the face, you can be
sure that the flip side of gain and joy are there as well, just waiting for the
moment when you turn the coin over.
This point is sort of obvious but can’t be stated too often: Just as with other
pairs, such as life and death, good and evil, truth and falsehood, or beauty
and ugliness, you don’t have one member of the pair without the other. Both
parts of the pair arise together and mutually support each other, even in
cases where one item usually precedes the other. For example, you have to
gain something before you can lose it, and you experience the joy of a rela-
tionship before you experience the grief over losing it.
Unfortunately, in their narrowest forms, some Western religious and philo-
sophical systems greatly downplay the reciprocity of these pairs by overem-
phasizing the more desirable member of the couple (gain, joy, light, good,
beauty, and so forth) at the expense of the other. A few even argue that you
actually can have the more desirable one without the less desirable other.
These one-sided views give rise to a sort of utopian thinking in which the goal
is the eradication of the less desirable member of the pair. This black-and-
white view of the world leaves little or no room for the orphaned member of
the pair (loss, grief, death, darkness, and the like).
Such one-sided thinking leads directly to the unrealistic expectation of many
people that they can live lives absent of the less desirable member of the pair
or, at the very minimum, should lead lives that emphasize, examine, and
strive for only its polar opposite. Most of us have grown up with and accepted
this worldview without question, but clearly it makes grieving all the more
difficult by associating grief’s direct cause (loss) with the side of the coin that
we rather naïvely believe we can do without.
How Fear of Loss and Death 
Impact Grieving
Most people harbor a certain amount of fear and loathing for one or more of
life’s more distasteful aspects, what I like to refer to collectively as Life’s Big
Downers. For some, the physical and mental decline from illness and disabil-
ity are top items on the list of Life’s Big Downers. For others, the physical and
mental deterioration associated with growing old is high on the list. For still
others, the physical and mental displacement that can come from jobless-
ness, homelessness, and even expatriation is the big-ticket item on the list.
And for almost every single person, the physical and mental dissolution cou-
pled with death claims the number-one spot.
In this section, I look at how the natural loathing associated with physical
and mental decline, disability, and displacement, along with the ever-present
19
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

fear of death, complicates grieving. First, I look at three of Life’s Big Downers —
decline, disability, and displacement — and how they can impact grieving.
Then I turn to death, the granddaddy of downers, and attempt to determine
how this fear really makes it difficult to be open to grieving (especially when
the people around you are grieving, too).
Loathing decline, disability, 
and displacement
Each morning, I get up and repeat to myself the maxim “panta rhei,” which
translates as “everything flows” or “all is in flux” (my loose translation is
“there’s only flowing”). This adage is attributed to one of the world’s first
Western philosophers, an ancient Greek fellow by the name of Heraclitus.
The message at the heart of the panta rhei axiom isn’t simply that change is
ongoing and therefore inevitable (a truism if there ever was one) but that
change is all there is! This idea of eternal changing poses a definite problem
when the type of change you have to look forward to is one that involves a
declining, disabling, and displacing of the resources you’ve worked so hard
to obtain or the faculties that you’ve taken for granted.
Yet, unfortunately, this is exactly the type of change that potentially faces all
of us who are fortunate enough to live on into our golden years. It’s possible
for some people to turn their fear and loathing of the decline associated with
aging into an intangible loss that they actually grieve. For example, for some
folks in our society, becoming elderly seems to be a fate worse than death.
These people react so strongly to the natural aging process that they invest
untold sums on ultimately ineffective antiaging products and even go so far
as to suffer the risks of unwarranted plastic surgery and the pain of recovery.
The fear of mental and physical decline, disability, and displacement that
hides in us can readily complicate our grieving of a profound loss. The lack of
control over emotions and mental focus in grieving mimics the lack of control
we associate with and fear in these debilitations. In us and in the people who
care about us, this connection easily triggers the fear that the emotional and
mental disruption and debilitation we’re experiencing due to this profound
loss will somehow become a permanent part of our being, like a physical dis-
ability from accident or disease.
Rest assured that the extreme emotional upheaval and serious lack of mental
focus that you so easily experience at the outset of grieving a profound loss
are definitely temporary and will eventually wane. That’s not to suggest that
you won’t ever find yourself suddenly riding that old emotional roller coaster
again after integrating the loss into your life or spacing out about the loss
after actively grieving it (these experiences can and do happen at what often
seem like the most unlikely times). However, ultimately, you’ll no longer be at
20
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

the mercy of wildly fluctuating feelings and will have your previous level of
mental focus and concentration back.
Dealing with the fear of death
No human fear is more deep seated while at the same time less heeded than
the Big Kahuna, the fear of death. We all know that death is our ultimate end,
yet we live our lives as though we’re going to stick around forever. How so?
We make the greatest efforts during the entire course of our lives to cultivate
wealth and influence, both of which we’re destined to leave behind in the
hands of others. Strangely enough, very few of us make an equal effort to cul-
tivate spiritual growth and love, legacies that may just have a fighting chance
of surviving the grave and accompanying us to the other side.
This discrepancy between fear and how we live our lives offers some explana-
tion of why, on the whole, we don’t deal well with death. We like to fool our-
selves into believing that, despite teachings to the contrary in all the great
spiritual traditions, our efforts to “have it all” have no debilitating effects on
the quality of our souls. We tend to play the role of Scarlett O’Hara when it
comes to confronting our inevitable death, reacting in the spirit of “Oh fiddle-
dee-dee, I’ll think about it tomorrow!”
The process of grieving is aggravated by the simple fact that it takes place in a
death-denying society. Because most of our grieving is over the death of loved
ones, it can trigger our own fear of death as well as that fear in the people
around us. People we come in contact with during our initial stages of acute
grieving are often strikingly short with us (and in some rare cases, they actu-
ally become angry with us) because our grief sets off their own fear of death.
Because your grieving can so easily remind others of their mortality and trig-
ger their fear of death, when seeking out someone to help you through your
grieving process — even a professional who isn’t specifically trained as a
grief counselor — you need to make sure that this person is comfortable with
the subject of death. The best way to find out, of course, is to ask how he
feels about death. If this proves too awkward, you should note carefully how
he responds to you when you speak about death. If you feel that he doesn’t
fully engage with you, or if he attempts to change the subject, you know that
he has issues with mortality that more than likely will adversely affect your
ability to grieve openly around him.
Developing a personal definition of birth and death
I once had the pleasure of attending a lecture by Maezumi Roshi, the founder
and head of the Los Angeles Zen Center, and experiencing his deep and extraor-
dinary energy. Later, I read one of his books in which he challenges the reader to
confront his own death by coming up with his own personal words and defini-
tion for it. We use so many euphemisms for death, such as passed away, late,
departed, and deceased, that this exercise is a good one for everybody to do.
21
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

Although Maezumi Roshi was never my personal teacher, I decided to take up
his challenge and create my own personal definition for death. This is some-
thing that you may want to do as well. If so, I suggest you start by contem-
plating the meaning of your life in light of your mortality.
The definition I came up with is the result of not only my Zen training and
graduate school learning but also my direct experience with death both on a
personal level and as a patient-care volunteer with a hospice. It’s also heavily
influenced by the fact that many of my fellow hospice workers liken them-
selves to acting as midwives for the dying.
My definition for death is being born into the world of unity (a world which
takes a whole bunch of different names, including the Kingdom of Heaven,
World to Come, Paradise, World of the Spirit, Nirvana, Moksha, One Mind,
Infinity, and even nothingness). Conversely, my definition of birth is being
born into the world of diversity.
I find the image of both birth and death as entrances into vastly different
experiences of a single reality to be quite helpful. It reminds me that although
we live in a world of multiplicity, these many facets are, in fact, simply the
face of unity. Likewise, the definitions enable me to approach my own demise
as a complete integration with this unity and another way of experiencing it
rather than as a complete dead end (pardon the pun).
Also, keeping this image of birth and death as entrances clearly in mind is
helpful in my hospice work because I’m reminded that, just as some births
22
Part I: Contemplating Grief 
One technique for dealing with debilitating fears
The fear of physical or mental decline can be
more debilitating than the actual disability itself.
You can deal with such fears by adapting the
three tasks of grieving that I outline in the sec-
tion “Grieving as a Natural Response to Loss”:
1. Acknowledge the fear to yourself and to
others if you can get them to listen.
2. Experience the fear rather than try to sup-
press and escape it.
For example, feel the closeness of breath
and shivers down your spine if that’s the
way your body responds to the fear. This is
definitely the most difficult task of the three.
3. Assimilate the fear by finding ways in
which to incorporate it into your life.
One way I assimilate my fear of becoming
mentally and physically disabled is by taking
stock of the caregivers and hospice work-
ers whom I’ve had the privilege of knowing
and working with. This reflection gives me
some measure of confidence that if I become
enfeebled, some sweet soul will treat me
with the same respect and care that I’ve
known these people to give.

into this world are easier than others (my mom would have readily told 
you that my birth as a breech baby was a great deal more difficult than my
brother’s), some deaths — as births into another phase of the world — are as
well. And as with being born into this world, the most important aspect about
dying isn’t whether or not you go into the next world headfirst (at peace and
willingly) or feet first (kicking and screaming) but whether or not you’re
properly supported throughout this great transition.
Putting the fear of death to good use
In Buddhism, death is to be appreciated as a very good friend (albeit one that
we certainly want to keep at a distance and definitely don’t want to bring
home to dinner) because it reminds us that our time as human beings is brief
and limited and thereby goads us into doing spiritual practice while we’re
still able.
That’s the theory at least, and I’ve found it to be a sound one. Unfortunately,
this idea just happens to run directly counter to the values that modern soci-
ety esteems and pushes so relentlessly (especially in the able hands of the
advertising and entertainment industries). In the modern age, dying is most
often hidden away, placed squarely in the hands of healthcare and then
funeral professionals. In their expert hands, death becomes sanitized, associ-
ated with institutions outside the home, and removed from our direct con-
sciousness. As a result, it’s now not that uncommon for young people to have
no direct experience with the death of a loved one, having never directly
experienced any person’s dying or been with a person’s body after death.
This personal unfamiliarity with death within a society that actively encour-
ages its disregard makes death very unreal for most people, to say the least.
Couple this lack of firsthand experience with the entertainment industry’s
highly stylized and often totally unrealistic depiction of death and dying, and
you have a prescription for an extremely distorted view of one’s mortality.
Instead of seeing death as the most natural thing in the world (the one single
experience that every person can count on having), death takes on an unreal
air and often becomes macabre. Instead of acting as an incentive to fully
experience every aspect of life, death becomes the ultimate enemy. Because
it’s currently impossible to defeat, death must be held in contempt when it’s
not totally overlooked.
Viewing death as the enemy does everybody a disservice because it so easily
steers us toward spending our lives achieving goals that seem hollow and
empty in light of its certainty. This viewpoint also complicates our relation-
ship to grieving and so hinders our ability to fully honor those we loved who
are so worthy of our grief. Thus, it exaggerates our natural apprehension
over our own mortality, thereby compromising our ability to live fully and
realistically and inhibiting our ability to help others we care about with their
grieving.
23
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

By coming to grips to with our mortality, we’re not only better prepared to
deal with the deaths of others and help them through their grief but much
more apt to live our lives fully engaged. In this way, although never our “best”
friend, death is a very useful one.
We’re All Bozos on the Grief Bus
When it comes to grieving, we are, to quote Wavy Gravy, “all bozos on this
bus.” Of the many reasons for our inexperience and discomfort with grief,
first and foremost is our overall ignorance and fear of death (as discussed in
the preceding section). To complicate matters, there exists a strong cultural
bias, at least in the United States, against the overt display of grief. Many
people, especially men, aren’t comfortable showing their emotions (espe-
cially crying), and even those who are comfortable expressing their emotions
do so only behind closed doors.
The result is that we live in a society that doesn’t really know what grief is or
how it normally unfolds. We don’t comprehend that it’s entirely natural and
healthy to grieve and, most important, that the grief resulting from a pro-
found loss isn’t something that you can get out of your system in just a few
months, let alone a few weeks.
24
Part I: Contemplating Grief 
Meditation to lessen the fear of death
When my own fear of death overtakes me, I do
the following meditation. I suggest that you try it,
too, if you find yourself overwhelmed by your
fear.
1. Sit for a second and imagine your state
before you were born. Examine the feel-
ings, if any, that you associate with that
period before exiting your mother’s womb,
before being a part of time and change.
2. Breathe for a moment or two, examining
and gently holding those feelings or lack of
feelings.
3. Contrast the tranquility or neutrality of the
feelings connected to the state before you
were born with the agitated feelings con-
nected to your fear of death.
4. Silently repeat this thought to yourself: “If
being dead is anything like not yet being
born, then I need not fear my death because
I can experience the type of composure
that death will bring me by contemplating
my state before birth.”

What to do when feelings aren’t your forte
The grieving process is perhaps most difficult for those folks who have trou-
ble openly expressing their feelings. Men, in particular, are traditionally
socialized to be stoic thinkers who ideally remain impervious to pain and
sorrow (and necessarily out of touch with the particular feelings of sorrow
that grieving stirs up). Even today, boys often are taught that showing grief
(especially by crying) is unmanly and a terrible sign of weakness. When
young men internalize this idea, their grieving is made more difficult by an
understandable inability to express the strong feelings that naturally arise.
Although most women generally aren’t socialized to suppress emotions and
normally have an easier time expressing their feelings, this isn’t always the
case. Studies by professionals in the grief field indicate that women who
don’t freely express their feelings and who work more from their heads than
their hearts have the most difficult time of any group in processing their
grief. The reason may be because the traditionally socialized men and women
around them misinterpret their manner of grieving (without the expected
emotional expression) as not grieving at all.
Regardless of gender, if you happen to be someone who isn’t particularly
comfortable getting in touch with your feelings, you have to be particularly
patient with yourself when grieving a profound loss. You may find that the
intensity of your feelings overwhelms your normal capacity to suck them in
and sit on them. You also may discover that the grief brought up by your cur-
rent loss triggers past grief that remains unincorporated into your life.
Although the resurfacing of unresolved grief can add to your current grief
work, it also may be a golden opportunity that you can’t afford to pass up.
Not only can you possibly mend past and present grief by dealing with your
current pain, but also you can discover ways to handle and honor your pow-
erful emotions without automatically suppressing them. This work, however,
may be too much to attempt on your own and may require the help and guid-
ance of a professional grief counselor (see Chapter 14 for information on
seeking out professional help).
Making a place for cooperation 
in the world of competition
Throughout this chapter, I underscore how a society that stresses competi-
tion and winning as the be-all and end-all of life makes the already unpleasant
task of grieving all the more difficult. In our world of arduous and relentless
competition, we need a lot more cooperation, or mutual support, when it
comes to grieving.
25
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

Cooperation not only opens up a natural space for loss but offers new ways of
supporting each other in grief. Recently, I had the good fortune of attending a
workshop entitled “The Healing Power of Grief,” presented by Sobonfu Somé,
a truly lovely woman from the small west African nation of Burkina Faso. Somé
introduced participants to the Dagara people’s communal grief ritual.
Participating in this culture’s public and shared grief ritual was a powerful
experience that showed me the value of collective grief and reinforced the
efficacy of mutual support. The cooperative nature of this rite removed any
notion of competition over whose grief was greater. It also underscored the
universality of grief among a group of people of different ages and very differ-
ent life experiences. And while I don’t advocate grafting the communal grief
ritual of the Dagara culture onto our society, I do think that it’s a good lesson
in the effectiveness of mutual support and the need for it when it comes to
individual grieving (to say nothing of public mourning).
Here are three separate yet interconnected steps toward being able to offer
mutual support to one another in times of grief:
1. Become more realistic about death.
Even if you aren’t able to become friends with death, at the very least, you
can be acquaintances instead of total strangers (with the understanding
that this is one acquaintance you’re going to get to know really intimately
at some, hopefully distant, point in your life). This first step is necessary
because you can’t make a very big place for grief (in your own or some-
body else’s life) if you can’t stand to be reminded of your mortality.
2. Make it crystal clear to yourself that grief is not optional in life.
You can’t get through life without experiencing profound loss (in most
cases, multiple losses often compound one another). When it dawns on

Bringing death and dying back into the home
A steady and growing movement is afoot to
bring dying and death back into the home,
where it typically was almost a quarter century
ago. The hospice movement makes every
attempt to enable a person to die in the comfort
of his own home surrounded by family and
friends if that’s the dying person’s wish. In addi-
tion to dying at home, there’s a growing move-
ment to bring wakes back into the home for
those who find funeral homes too impersonal or
too expensive.

us that we’re all in the same boat (a leaky old tub named the SS Good
Grief), we’re much more likely to cut each other some much needed
slack when it comes to grieving.
3. Promote the understanding that grieving is nothing extraordinary (in
the sense of being weird or abnormal).
Grief is a totally natural response to loss and, in the vast majority of
cases, represents an attempt to restore health to a temporarily wounded
system. However, although natural and shared by all, it’s also an individ-
ual response and, as such, follows its own course and takes its own
sweet time.
Armed with a degree of comfort with death and a clear understanding that
grief is a common and normal human condition, we can all mutually comfort
and better support one another through our inevitable turns with grief. (And
that just happens to be the goal of this book!)
Searching for Meaning in 
the Midst of Sorrow
A common misconception is that people of faith and religious practice are
steeled by their beliefs against the pain of loss and therefore suffer less in
their grieving. The idea is that the larger worldview offered by faith enables
them to put meaning to the loss, and this meaning somehow alleviates the
pain. I’m sorry to burst anybody’s bubble, but I strongly disagree with this
analysis.
Religious faith and practice can facilitate a person’s grieving not by lessening
the intensity of the person’s grief but rather by better enabling him to incor-
porate the loss into his life by offering a much greater context in which to
place it. This broader framework is what gives the loss meaning. In the tech-
speak of the grief professional, the person’s religious faith better enables him
to reframe the loss. However, reframing doesn’t absolve the person from suf-
fering the pain of the loss because the new framework only provides a means
for absorbing the loss after the person tackles the hard work of acknowledg-
ing it and feeling the grief it generates.
Grief can try a person’s faith and even best it. Some people find their losses
to be so heavy and incomprehensible that they not only question their faith
but actually abandon it — occasionally only for the duration of the grieving
but sometimes for good. For those who aren’t particularly religious or who
have fallen away from a particular religious tradition, the lack of a compre-
hensible meaning behind a profound loss can either reinforce their separa-
tion from religion or set in motion a new round of existential questioning that
ultimately brings them to accept and participate in a new system of belief.

Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

Making some sense of suffering
Goodness knows that when grieving hits us squarely in the gut, the human
defense mechanism kicks in. We’re convinced that we wouldn’t be in nearly
as much pain if we could just make some sense of the crazy world that pro-
duced this unfortunate loss. I resist this notion because I see grieving primar-
ily as a response to the loss of a relationship with a loved one and not as a
response to the cause of that loss. From this point of view, there’s no reason
to grieve any less. For example, suppose you lose a beloved parent by the
natural death of ripe old age (may we all be so blessed). Surely you can say
that there’s a good reason for the loss — your parent’s body could no longer
renew itself and keep on functioning. Even with that reasonable explanation,
however, you can’t expect not to grieve your loss fully.
Unfortunately, this logic doesn’t cut both ways. If you suffer an incomprehen-
sible loss that’s totally unjustifiable because it so easily could have been
avoided, you suffer not only the pain of the loss but also the fact that the loss
was so needless. For example, if you lose a dear friend in a car accident
caused by someone under the influence of drugs or alcohol, you’re devas-
tated by both the loss of your friend and the fact that his death was so unnec-
essary. In such a situation, you have to deal with your righteous anger as well
as the pain of the grieving (and this is a case in which the grieving can be
complicated — in the clinical sense — and thus requires the help of profes-
sional counseling).
The real problem of spending time and energy trying to make sense of a pro-
found loss is that it doesn’t change the outcome. No matter what theory you
come up with to explain a loss, the explanation doesn’t bring the person back
or excuse you from grieving the loss.
Sometimes, I get the feeling that people fixate on understanding the reason
for the loss because, in their inexperience with grief, they think this is a nec-
essary part of grieving. Other times, I get the feeling that people fixate on the
reason for the loss rather than the loss itself because they hope against hope
that doing this releases them from having to feel the pain of the loss.
Although it may seem as though I’m pooh-poohing seeking out a reason for
suffering in this world, I’m really not. Making sense of a profound loss, if you
feel compelled to do so, is one of the last tasks that you should assume in the
grief process. In other words, it doesn’t take the highest priority when you’re
first thrust into grieving a profound loss. Rather, making sense of the loss is a
natural fit with the third task, incorporating the loss into the remainder of
your life (see “Grieving as an involved process,” earlier in this chapter). In
this stage, finding meaning can enable you to stay connected to the one you’ve
lost and can guide you in reconnecting with the wider world around you.
We can’t pretend to know the real answer to the question of why bad things
happen to good people (and I’m not sure that it’s part of our job as human
28
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

beings to have this understanding). We do, however, always run the risk of
sabotaging our grieving by obscuring the question of how best to grieve with
the question of why we have to grieve.
To the enlightened person, investigating why bad things happen to good
people is nowhere near as vital as investigating how best to alleviate the suf-
fering that arises from the bad situation.
When bad things happen to good people
From time immemorial, people have questioned why bad things happen to
good people. And for the longest time, some well-meaning people have put
forward the same tired answer that bad things don’t happen to good people,
they happen exclusively to bad people who often are deluded into thinking
that they’re good.
Oh, for the patience of Job!
The Book of Job in the Bible is one of the most famous Western examples of a
search for an answer to the question of why bad things happen to good people.
In brief, it’s the story of a righteous man named Job (rhymes with globe)
whose faith in God is sorely tried — first by the loss of his wife and children,
along with his cattle and servants (both counted as wealth in those days),
and later by the loss of his own health.
God authorizes this test of Job’s faith after Satan (who else would be so bold?)
openly questions Job’s motivation for remaining upright in the sight of the
Lord. Satan suggests that if God were to remove the many blessings He has
bestowed on Job, Job will “certainly curse Thee to Thy face” (Job 1:11).
After Satan destroys all that Job has (including his good health), Job contin-
ues to protest that he has done nothing to deserve this fate. Job’s (so-called)
friends insist that he must have performed some iniquity to have caused God
to punish him with all his profound losses.
This argument over whether or not Job is really a good man to whom some
really crummy things have happened takes up most of the book. Job, how-
ever, is nothing if not persistent in his own defense and doesn’t stop protest-
ing his innocence to his friends and heaven itself. God finally has enough of
Job’s protestations and confronts him directly by, in essence, asking him who
he thinks he is to question God’s motives. Job finally pipes down and says, “I
had heard of Thee by hearsay, but now my eye has seen Thee. That is why I
sink down and repent in dust and ashes” (Job 42:4–6).
In terms of how to make some sense of seemingly undeserved suffering, the
Book of Job argues strongly and consistently against the commonly held
notion that bad things only happen to bad people. It offers no clear answer to
29
Chapter 1: Connecting Grieving with Loss

the persistent question “Why does God allow evil in the world?” other than
the severe view that pain like that suffered by Job is visited on people simply
as a test of faith.
Better, I think, to adopt Job’s final position wherein instead of being content
to hear about the divine through hearsay, you establish a direct relationship
with the divine that enables you to see it directly with your own eyes. Then,
as with Job, you can sink down (relax) and repent (in the sense of atoning by
being truly in harmony with the divine) in your dust and ashes (your very
mortal body).
By the way, in case you’re the slightest bit interested, the Book of Job has a
perfectly acceptable Hollywood ending. After Job repents, God takes Job’s
friends to task for arguing the false theory that bad things don’t happen to
good people and for falsely accusing Job of unrighteousness. He then has
them offer Job cattle for forgiveness. After Job forgives his erstwhile friends,
God fully rehabilitates Job, recompensing him double what was taken from
him. Job lives happily ever after to the ripe old age of 140 years and sees four
generations of children and grandchildren grow up (fade to black).
Karma as cosmic comeuppance
Karma as the Buddhist law of cause and effect is often touted as the reason
that bad things appear to happen to good people. Accordingly, the people
who now appear to be so good and innocent were once bad people (in one or
more of their past lives), and although it appears (especially to the untrained
eye) that they’re now needlessly suffering, they are, in fact, just reaping the
bitter harvest that they sowed in the past. It just took an awful long time for
conditions to be right for their bad deeds to spring up like weeds and grab
hold of them.
So as a result of some very subtle thinking, we’re right back where we started
with the idea that bad things in fact don’t happen to good people. In this
Eastern version, they just sometimes take their own sweet time in catching
up to the wicked and punishing them — so much time, in fact, that they end
up punishing the good. I don’t know about you, but this theory does me no
more good than that of Job’s dear friends.
The Zen school of Buddhism teaches that cause and effect constitute a single
process. Even when one can’t know exactly the reasons for the loss he suf-
fers, he does know the consequential grief with great precision. Accordingly,
it can be through the experience of grieving the loss that one rediscovers
that what matters isn’t primarily what happens to him but how he responds
to that experience.

Relating Grief to the 
Manner of Death
In This Chapter
 Preparing for an imminent death
 Exploring the impact of a sudden and unexpected death
 Coping with a death through suicide
 Reaching out for more information
W
hen you lose a loved one, it’s important to understand the loss from
the viewpoint of the type of relationship you have with the deceased.
But you can’t overlook the importance of the way in which your loved one
dies. The manner of death influences your grief and grieving process as well.
This chapter takes a detailed look at the various kinds of losses ranging from
slow and fully anticipated deaths to sudden and quite violent deaths. The
chapter surveys these modes of death without any particular regard to your
relationship to the deceased. It does this on the assumption that the particu-
lar stresses associated with each kind of death add to the overall grief work
that you need to do.
The chapter begins with an examination of death caused by illness or natural
debilitation (better known as old age). These causes of death result in some
type of prolonged dying process that ultimately ends in an anticipated and,
depending upon how protracted the dying process is, a longed-for death. As
part of this investigation, I look at the phenomenon known as anticipatory
grief (the grief you experience before the death of a loved whose passing is
highly anticipated) and its relationship to the other stresses of caregiving.
Next, the chapter looks at the impact of losing a loved one through some sort
of dementia (a progressive decline in cognitive brain function) that robs you
of your loved one sometimes long before his physical death; this condition
often is seen in people with Alzheimer’s disease and sometimes in folks with
advanced Parkinson’s disease.

The chapter then moves on to look at the impact of experiencing the sudden
loss of a loved one through natural causes or violent death as well as the
heartbreak and trauma of losing a loved one as the result of suicide. This spe-
cial type of death is particularly difficult to handle given the widespread
social and religious censure of the taking of one’s life and loved ones’ guilt
and regret at not being able to prevent it.
The chapter concludes with suggestions for other resources that you can
consult to get more help dealing with the particular kinds of loss covered in
this chapter. These resources include books and Web sites with information
and online communities as well as a listing of community resources you can
contact directly.
The Impact of an Anticipated Loss
With anticipatory grief, you’re grieving what you’ve already lost and what
you’re in the process of losing in the present as well as what you fear losing
in the future. And in so doing, you’re caught in the impossible position of
having to find ways to grieve all these losses without relinquishing any
attachment to your loved one at the same time.
The psychological impact of an anticipated loss of a loved one depends upon
a number of factors, of which the following are normally the most important:
 The pace of the disease or disability and the amount of time you have
left with your loved one prior to his death
 The amount of pain and suffering that your loved one has to endure in
this period of declining health
 The degree of mental alertness, recognition, and cognition that your
loved one maintains during the period of declining health prior to death
 Your loved one’s ability to communicate with you
 Whether you’re primarily responsible for making healthcare decisions
on behalf of your loved one or you share this responsibility with other
family members
 Whether you can provide care for your loved at home or he must be
cared for in a skilled-nursing facility or other long-term care facility
 Whether you’re the primary caregiver for your loved one and whether
you’re relieved from time to time by other caregivers, either professional
or volunteer
32
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

In reviewing this list of factors, it’s quite obvious that the two biggest issues
are the amount of time you have left to spend with your loved one and the
quality of life that you and your loved one enjoy during this time.
If your loved one is suffering from a particularly aggressive form of a fatal dis-
ease or disability, your time together may be quite limited. In this situation,
there’s also a good chance that he will endure some degree of pain, and med-
ication, as well as the speed of the decline, may well impair his mental alert-
ness and recognition.
If your loved one is suffering from a fatal disease or disability that normally
has a slow and somewhat steady decline, you can be pretty sure that your
time together won’t be limited. You can also count on having to deal with the
stress of more healthcare- and caregiving-related issues than usually accom-
pany other causes of death.
What is less clear with an anticipated loss is the amount of pain and mental
decline that your loved one will suffer.
 With some conditions, such as dying naturally from old age, pain may 
be almost nonexistent, and mental alertness may remain high until the
very end.
 With other conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, pain may not be
much of an issue, but mental faculties may suffer a notable decline 
in the later stages.
 With some conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, the main challenge
may have less to with pain and mental decline and more to do with the
ability of your loved one to communicate with you about his condition
and needs.
In their advanced stages, many long-term diseases and disabilities make
it extremely difficult for your loved one to speak loudly enough or clearly
enough to be understood. Some conditions may make it impossible for
your loved one to speak at all.
The stress of trying to ensure comfort and quality of life for your loved one
takes its toll both physically and emotionally. You must get relief from others
(family members, professional caregivers, or volunteers) whenever and wher-
ever you can. Handing over responsibilities — even temporarily — enables
you to decompress so that you don’t fall apart and can be with your loved
one for the long haul.
33
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

Using the time you have left
One worthwhile aspect of experiencing an anticipated loss of a loved one
from a disease or disability is that you usually have sufficient time to tie up
any loose ends, make amends by forgiving any real or supposed injuries,
review your relationship together, and say your goodbyes.
Although an anticipated loss usually affords you the opportunity to get all
these ducks in a row, unfortunately, this time is seldom used in this manner.
Instead, you may find yourself far too busy with caregiving and helping your
loved one maintain a brave face in his desperate attempt to stave off the
inevitable to ever bring up such discussions.
Whenever the fight against death is relentless and unremitting to the very
end, a real tragedy can ensue. By the time everyone on the team (sufferer,
loved ones, family, and doctors) finally agrees that nothing can or should be
done to fight the disease, it’s often too late to have important, heart-to-heart
discussions. By that time, your loved one may be too weak, medicated, pain-
ridden, and close to the end to maintain the alertness and focus needed to
engage in these kinds of discussions.
Instead of receiving the reassurances that you need to hear from your loved
one before he dies, you may have to settle for reassuring him of your love and
forgiveness. Too often, however, when death is imminent or your loved one
has slipped into a coma, you don’t even get the satisfaction of knowing that
your loved one has heard your words and understood what you’re saying.
Even if your loved one is unconscious or very near death, go ahead and
express your love and let him know how much he’ll be missed and how much
your relationship with him has meant to you. Although you won’t know for
sure that he has heard and understood your words (although I believe that
those close to death do hear and understand on some level), at least you
don’t have to live with any regret about not having told him these feelings
before he died.
Preparing for the end with the help of hospice services
One way to get some help and alleviate some of the stresses associated with
an anticipated loss is to make use of the hospice services in your local com-
munity (see the sidebar “About hospice and its basic services”). The aim of
hospice is to help your loved one die in dignity and comfort. Hospice services
are geared to ensuring that your loved one is as pain free, alert, and active as
possible until the very end of his life.
34
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

If you register with a local hospice organization (as opposed to placing 
your loved one in a live-in hospice facility), the hospice team assigned to
your family may arrange for your loved one to be cared for and die at home.
The team also can provide you with pain medication and needed medical
supplies. In some cases, the social worker on the team can help secure spe-
cially needed medical equipment as well as deal with all the paperwork and
bureaucracy associated with private health insurance as well as Medicare or
Medicaid.
The hospice team can also support you by providing you with visits from the
following individuals:
 An interfaith chaplain who can offer spiritual care
 A home health aid volunteer who can bathe your loved one
 A patient-care volunteer or a paid caregiver to give you some respite and
enable you to do needed errands
 A complementary-care volunteer who can give your loved one a mas-
sage or some other form of body work appropriate to his particular
physical condition
As your loved one’s condition declines and he nears death, many hospice
organizations have trained vigil volunteers who will sit with your loved one
for periods when you or other members of the family can’t be there. This 
service is particularly helpful if your loved one is dying in a skilled-nursing
facility and the family lives at some distance and hasn’t yet assembled at the
bedside. In this circumstance, you have the comfort of knowing that someone
is attending to your loved one; you don’t have to worry that he will die alone
before a member of the family can get there.
Hospice services don’t end with the death of your loved one. Hospices offer
many grief services, usually in the form of trained bereavement counselors
and, in some cases, bereavement volunteers who can help through one-on-
one support as well as a variety of grief support groups (see Chapter 14 for
more on these support services).
The one little problem with any hospice service is getting your dying loved
one registered on its rolls in enough time to make good use of its end-of-life
services. Too many times, the people who are ill, their doctors, and their fam-
ilies don’t stop to consider hospice as an appropriate option (as opposed to
aggressively fighting the disease) until the sufferers are literally at death’s
door (or at least sitting on its stoop). Then, instead of months of great end-of-
life care, your loved one receives only a week or two’s worth, which, while it
is sufficient time to assemble the hospice team and develop the plan of care,
deprives you of the very important support that hospice can offer you over
time.
35
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

When the anticipated loss becomes a blessing
With some diseases and disabilities, your loved one may linger a long time in
a state where the quality of his life is nominal before dying. Depending upon
how minimal his quality of life is and how much suffering he had to endure
before his passing, it’s entirely possible that initially you may feel relieved
rather than grieved when he finally dies.
Being relieved that a loved one is no longer suffering or suspended in some
state between life and death is an entirely natural reaction for which you
should feel no guilt. Just remember that the feelings of relief will be followed
in short order with feelings of loss and grief. Although a great burden on your
heart is lifted when someone you love finally is no longer suffering or caught
36
Part I: Contemplating Grief 
About hospice and its basic services
Most hospice services are delivered in one of
two forms: dedicated hospice organizations or
dedicated hospice facilities. Both are designed
to provide end-of-life and palliative care (care
designed solely to alleviate mental and physical
discomfort) for people with terminal diseases 
or disabilities. The following are their primary
differences:
 Hospice organizations: Care usually is pro-
vided to your loved one in the home,
although certain hospice organizations
offer their services to people who are living
in nursing homes and other types of long-
term care facilities.
 Hospice facilities:Your loved one is admitted
to the facility, where he lives and receives
around-the-clock professional care.
To qualify for the these hospice services, your
loved one’s primary physician must recommend
him for the program on the understanding that
his medical condition is steadily declining and
that he’s most likely near the end of his life (usu-
ally with a prognosis of six months or less to
live). The physician also must confirm that your
loved one’s no longer seeking active treatment
to reverse or cure his disease or condition but
instead is ready to receive only palliative care
to manage pain.
When your loved one qualifies for hospice serv-
ices, the following occurs:
1. A core hospice team comprised of a hos-
pice nurse and social worker under the
management of hospice’s medical director
assembles.
2. Optional members, such as a chaplain,
home health aid, and patient-care volunteer,
may augment the core team as desired by
the patient and his family. Occasionally, a
bereavement counselor may be brought in
for help in dealing with anticipatory grief.
3. The core hospice team draws up a plan 
of care for the patient and his family that
includes regular visits by the nurse and 
the social worker in the home or skilled-
nursing facility.
4. The core team reviews the patient’s status
with the medical director and other profes-
sional hospice staff on a regular basis for
the rest of the time the patient is in hospice.

in a vegetative state, you’re not relieved of the burden of grieving his loss.
Even if you longed for the loss because of the dire circumstances, the rela-
tionship is nonetheless broken with death, and you still need to honor it and
the bond you had with your lost loved one by accepting and experiencing
your grief.
Dealing with anticipatory grief 
and the stresses of caregiving
Anticipatory grief is the name given to the angst and sorrow that accompanies
the knowledge that your loved one almost certainly is going to die from what-
ever disease or debilitating condition he’s suffering. The watchword of antici-
patory grief is angst: You fear the loss that you know is coming more than
you actually grieve it.
Anticipatory grief often is accompanied by outbursts of sorrow and rage fol-
lowed by bouts of depression. Because this type of grief is intertwined with
fear, you find it particularly draining, especially when you’re dealing with the
other stresses associated with being a caregiver for your dying loved one.
Many people mistakenly believe that, in suffering anticipatory grief, they lessen
the grief that they’ll experience when death finally comes. Unfortunately, this
is not so. Don’t expect the grief that you feel and the grieving process that
you have to undergo when your loved one finally passes away to be any less
even if you’ve suffered a ton of anticipatory grief.
Some grief professionals debate whether or not anticipatory grief can be sep-
arated from the other stresses you undergo as a caregiver. It’s well docu-
mented that being a caregiver for a loved one who’s dying is extremely
stressful for any number of the following reasons:
 Burnout from trying to do all the caregiving on your own without the
help of others or from having to be the caregiver for more than one
loved one (as in trying to care for both your aged or ailing parents at the
same time)
 Feelings of extreme isolation when the caregiving seems to take over
every aspect of your life
 Resentment toward the loved one for needing the care, frustration with
the medical or insurance bureaucracy, and/or anger toward other family
members for not helping with caregiving
37
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

 Guilt that you aren’t able provide to better care for your loved one, for
finally having to put him in a nursing home, and/or for not being able to
save his life
 Difficulty watching the health and vitality of someone you love decline
 Helplessness in the face of the anticipated loss and the overwhelming
and growing demands of being the caregiver for an increasingly incapaci-
tated loved one
Don’t ignore the feelings of angst and stress associated with anticipatory
grief and with caregiving for a loved one. Instead, find ways to express and
validate your feelings. Seek the help of family or grief counselors, social work-
ers, or psychologists in order to keep yourself going. If you’re a primary care-
giver, you also may need to get some help with the caregiving from other
family members, community services, or a hospice team. Although you may
feel as though you have to “keep it together” in order to be an effective care-
giver, you may actually be less effective if you don’t deal with the psychologi-
cal tolls from the stresses related to caregiving.
Dealing with a loss from dementia
Dementia refers not to the name of a particular disease but rather to a
number of neurological disorders that arise from various types of diseases,
most notably Alzheimer’s disease. Most of the symptoms associated with
dementia involve the loss of cognitive function (especially memory loss),
although personality and behavioral changes are also common and can
include extreme agitation, delusions, and sometimes even hallucinations.
When a loved one suffers from a form of dementia that involves progressive
memory loss (as with some forms of Alzheimer’s disease), you may have the
tremendously sad experience of feeling as though you’ve lost your loved one
before he actually dies. The anticipatory grief associated with this type of sit-
uation can be quite overwhelming, especially if you’re also a primary care-
giver for your loved one.
Even when dementia doesn’t involve memory loss, the challenges of caring
for someone suffering various types of dementia can be quite daunting. It’s
particularly trying to watch a loved one become extremely agitated, espe-
cially if he can’t communicate the reason and you have no idea of what to do
to help. Some families also find it particularly difficult to experience their loved
one’s becoming delusional, often by relating true events out of sequence.
38
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Caregiving for a loved one suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer’s can
be especially tough because he may develop a strong inclination to wander
whenever he gets the chance. This urge puts an extra burden on you in terms
of watching him and, in extreme cases, putting him under some sort of
restraint.
Whenever a loved one suffers a loss of mental capacity or memory, or shows
signs of being delusional, it feels as though the person you love is disappear-
ing before your very eyes, especially if, earlier in life, he strongly identified
with his mental prowess and achievements (for example, a professional, edu-
cator, or entrepreneur). Many people feel as though their cognitive abilities
are essential elements of their personalities and identities, without which
they might as well be dead.
The anticipatory grief associated with caring for someone with dementia is
enormous. As with grief from other anticipated losses, you need to be mind-
ful of the stress that this situation brings and take any steps you can to pre-
vent caregiver burnout. This can include getting outside help so that you can
take regular breaks as well as seeking counseling from a professional grief
counselor so that you can fully express your feelings.
Grieving a Sudden Loss
Because you can’t predict the sudden loss of a loved one ahead of time, you
can’t prepare yourself, and the loss almost always comes as an enormous
shock to you and other bereft family members and friends.
The bottom line of suffering the sudden loss of a loved one is that you never
get a chance to say goodbye. This missed opportunity, plus the shock of the
unexpected death, can make grieving a sudden loss particularly difficult. For
suggestions on how to deal with regret stemming from the inability to say
goodbye to your loved one before his death, see Chapter 14.
A sudden loss can result from any number of causes. The three general
causes responsible for almost all sudden deaths are
 Medical conditions such as a stroke, brain aneurism, or fatal heart
attack
 Accidents that can be man-made, as in the case of a car crash or a bridge
collapse, or natural, as in the case of a hurricane or an earthquake
 Assaults including physical attacks in a whole array of circumstances:
domestic violence, gang warfare, military war, shootings, robberies, and
terrorist attacks, for example
39
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

Blaming yourself for not 
preventing the death
When dealing with the death of a loved one due to a medical condition, acci-
dent, or assault, it’s not unusual for a surviving loved one to assume some
personal responsibility for the death. Yet in the case of some sudden deaths,
survivors consider the death almost completely random and simply a case of
very bad luck or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Here are
some examples of both scenarios:
 Your loved one is diagnosed with heart disease yet continues to smoke
like a chimney, refuses to exercise, and continues to eat a diet high in
the bad LDL cholesterol. He heightens his risk of dying from heart dis-
ease and may even bear some responsibility if he actually suffers a fatal
heart attack.
 Your loved one is going to a grocery store to pick up a few things and
must drive over a bridge to get there. This bridge is old, but it doesn’t
carry any warning signs, and your loved one travels over it regularly.
Without any warning, the bridge buckles and collapses, and your loved
one dies in the ensuing crash of his car. Undoubtedly, the death is con-
sidered a freak accident. No one blames your loved one for taking an
unnecessary risk in crossing the bridge and thereby causing his own
demise.
The interesting thing in terms of grief over sudden loss, however, is that
bereaved loved ones can find ways to feel guilty and somewhat responsible
for a death regardless of the circumstance. For example, in the case of the
heart attack, you may blame yourself for not being more persistent in pres-
suring your loved one to stop smoking, go to the gym, eat his greens, and
take his cholesterol medicine.
Even in the case of the bridge accident, you may find a way to blame yourself,
even if it’s more of a reach. You may feel guilty that you suggested that your
loved one go to the store that’s over the bridge for the things he needed. You
may even go so far as to blame yourself for not having picked up the things
he needed during the day so he wouldn’t have had to venture out that fateful
night!
The fact is that bereaved people who have suffered the sudden loss of a
loved one more often than not feel compelled to second-guess their responsi-
bility and take on some of the blame for the death, regardless of whether the
circumstances of the death actually warrant such feelings. This need to ques-
tion what you possibly could have done to prevent the loss is therefore quite
natural. Assuming blame only becomes a problem if you start to fixate on
40
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

your responsibility in the death and can’t get beyond it to grieve the loss of
your loved one. (See Chapter 14 for suggestions on ways to deal with feelings
of responsibility.)
Blaming someone else 
for causing the death
In some instances, blaming yourself for what you consider your part in the
death of a loved one gives way to placing the blame on someone else. You
may blame someone else regardless of whether the loss is the result of a
medical condition or an accident, although blaming others is much more
common in the case of death from an assault.
Holding other people responsible
When you hold someone else responsible for a death caused by a medical
condition, you’re likely to look to someone in the medical profession — the
attending physician, nurses, or some other medical staff. Sometimes, how-
ever, the fault falls on the medical insurer or even the medical facility.
In the case of an accidental death not related to a natural disaster, you may
blame the people you feel are responsible for the incident either directly or
indirectly. For example, in the case of a car accident, you surely blame the
other driver, especially if it’s proved that he’s clearly at fault. In the case of a
bridge collapse, however, you’d have no one to blame directly; you may look
to the people indirectly associated with the bridge mishap, such as the engi-
neers who may not have properly designed the structure or the county offi-
cials who failed to ensure proper upkeep of the bridge.
Blaming God when no one else is to blame
In the case of an accidental death in a natural disaster, normally you can find
no one to blame (and this fact alone can be quite frustrating). Sometimes,
such losses give rise to a crisis in faith, especially if you believe that God per-
sonally intervenes in human history. In such a case, you may even go so far
as to blame the Almighty for not intervening and preventing the disaster that
caused your loss.
However, as I point out in Chapter 1 in my discussion of the biblical story of
Job, this kind of thinking makes for a very slippery slope. It’s all too easy for
others of faith holding a similar concept of the Almighty to turn the tables on
you: They can just as easily assert that the natural disaster was God’s will
and was therefore visited on your loved one and all who perished with him as
some sort of rightful retribution or punishment for some iniquities.
41
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

Blaming the responsible party
Deaths resulting from a physical assault of some kind almost always require
finding and laying blame on the responsible party. In fact, this is the one area
where a great deal of time and energy goes into not only identifying the guilty
party but also bringing him to justice.
Finding the guilty party and seeing him brought to justice is often a neces-
sary first step in grieving the death of your loved one. This is the one time
when the concept of closure may well apply. Discovering exactly what hap-
pened to your loved one and how and sometimes why he died, although
extremely painful and maybe even traumatic (see Chapter 12 for more on
trauma), may be your only access to grieving the death of your loved one.
Until the facts surrounding the death are clearly resolved, you’ll have a
tremendously difficult time moving through the normal stages of grieving
(which I cover in Chapter 11).
Identifying the person or persons responsible for the death of a loved one
and establishing the facts surrounding the death are undoubtedly key ele-
ments in getting closure for many bereaved families. It’s open to question,
however, whether seeing justice done to the perpetrator(s) is also a neces-
sary element.
For certain bereaved families, seeing justice done is important. The problem,
however, is that the family’s concept of what constitutes justice in the case
may differ widely from that of the justice system itself. Moreover, there seems
to be a fine line between justice and retribution, and when the family crosses
this line, they may become consumed with the need to settle the score. This
quest for vengeance often has a corrosive effect on the family’s ability to
move on into successfully grieving the loss.
The real problem with retribution, as summed up in the old biblical “eye for
an eye” philosophy, is that it doesn’t restore sight to the semiblinded victim.
Instead, it only succeeds in making yet another person somewhat sightless.
And although this type of retribution may represent justice in its most basic
form, it’s devoid of the caring qualities that you need in order to heal the loss
of a loved one. Worse, retribution offers no guarantee that you’ll be released
from fixating on the wrong done to you and your loved one, which can make
it nearly impossible to grieve the loss. Only forgiveness can offer you this
type of assurance (see Chapter 14).
If you feel the need to lay blame on the persons or circumstances responsible
for the death of your loved one, be very careful that your drive doesn’t dis-
place your need to grieve the loss. Especially when the loss is fresh and par-
ticularly painful, it’s easy to become fixated on the liability issue rather than
the loss itself. Although you definitely need to work through all the feelings
42
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

you have surrounding responsibility, doing so isn’t a substitute for grieving
your lost loved one but rather a way to access the grief work you still need to
do. (Turn to Chapter 12 for more on troubled grieving.)
Grieving a Death by Suicide
Suicide produces a very special and complex type of loss. It’s a death in
which you definitely know who the responsible party is, although you still
may not know all the circumstances that led up to it. Death by suicide can be
either of the following:
 An anticipated loss that you desperately tried to prevent, fighting long
and hard side by side with your loved one
 A sudden loss that didn’t come with the traditional warning signs, 
as well as one that you naively thought your loved one had put far
behind him
Making matters even more difficult is the fact that suicide is one of those rare
types of losses that’s almost universally disapproved of by traditional reli-
gions and society at large. As a result, the people left behind often feel shame
along with the inevitable guilt. The typical bereaved family deals with a triple
whammy of pain: dishonor and recrimination heaped on top of the grief of
the loss.
Experiencing the suicide of a loved one
Although suicide is deemed an unnecessary death, all suicides are not equal.
Consider the case of an old man racked with the progressive pain and disabil-
ity of a terminal illness who ends his own life. Consider the case of a young,
healthy, and extremely bright teenage girl racked with depression and self-
doubt who ends her own life.
Although religions and society at large may see no qualitative difference
between these two examples, judging both to be cases of senseless and need-
less deaths, most people wouldn’t see them as quite the same. More impor-
tant, the bereaved families of the two people probably wouldn’t grieve the
deaths in quite the same way.
In the case of the old man with the terminal illness who commits suicide, his
family may have a sense of understanding. Moreover, they may even harbor a
sense of relief, seeing that their loved one is no longer in physical pain or suf-
fering psychological distress over his deteriorating physical condition and
increasing debility.
43
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

In the case of the teenage girl suffering from deep depression who commits
suicide, the family may not understand at all why this had to happen. They
may harbor a real sense of guilt over not having been able to prevent the
death, as well as real feelings that this loss is as senseless as it is tragic.
Many times, the members of a family bereft of a loved one lost to suicide
have a great deal of anger over the situation. They may direct their anger at
themselves for not having been able to decipher the warning signs and pre-
vent the death. They also may direct anger toward the lost loved one for not
reaching out to someone to get help, for going through with the suicide, and
for putting the entire family through a preventable nightmare. Altogether, sur-
vivors can experience a combination of hurt feelings that can include rejec-
tion and abandonment, along with a profound shattering of their self-esteem.
Dealing with guilt and second-guessing
Families grieving the suicide of a loved one usually aren’t dealing with the rel-
atively straightforward and mild type of “woulda, coulda, shoulda” second-
guessing that seems to routinely accompany the other types of losses. Instead,
these families are much more apt to be plagued by a deep sense of responsi-
bility and remorse for not having prevented the act.
This deep sense of guilt of bereaved family members is fueled in no small
part by the idea that the death was totally unnecessary. And as a result, the
loss not only could have been avoided but, in fact, should have been avoided.
The feeling that you should have been able to prevent the suicide is, in turn,
fueled by the understanding that the people who commit suicide generally
give warning signs before committing the act (see the sidebar “Classic warn-
ing signs of suicide”). However, it’s also true that even if you recognize the
signs (and most people do) and try to get your loved one the help he needs,
there’s no guarantee that you can save him and ultimately prevent his death.
Some people who commit suicide never show the classic signs before com-
pleting the act. You may find your loved one more withdrawn and down than
usual, but you may not get any indication that he’s in serious trouble and
about to end it all.
Dealing with shame
Unfortunately, the unyielding condemnation of suicide by major religions
such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and the secular societies that they
44
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

influence makes many people grieving the suicide of a loved one feel a real
sense of shame over the death. Some religions go so far as to deny the victim
of suicide traditional burial rites (Judaism), while others teach that suicide is
a major sin that may preclude the victim’s ultimate salvation (some sects of
Christianity and Islam).
The belief that suicide is such a major and unforgivable sin is rooted in the
notion that God is the source of all life, and as such, all life is sacred and not
to be taken in vain. To me, it’s highly ironic how easily religions can justify
the taking of others’ lives (when they’re deemed enemies of the faith or the
state) and be forgiving of those killings while remaining so unrelenting in
their condemnation of taking one’s own life.
The big difference between someone who contemplates and someone who
acts is that the former doesn’t lose all hope in the future and is able to pull
back and recover his normal, balanced sense of life before it’s too late.
My take on suicide is that no one actually commits the act while in his right
mind. The person who does may be out of his right mind for any number of
reasons — chemical imbalance, genetic propensity, child abuse, chronic
depression, and who knows what else — but he’s out of his normal way of
thinking nonetheless. Therefore, I can’t believe that anyone who actually
commits suicide is culpable for his own murder in the same way as someone
who takes another person’s life premeditatively. And, as a result, I think that
the person who commits suicide actually is much easier to forgive.
45
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death
Classic warning signs of suicide
The classic warning signs of suicide include the
following behaviors:
 Previous suicide attempts
 Talking about suicide
 Making statements about feeling hopeless
or about how life is no longer worth living
 Preoccupation with death
 Suddenly putting one’s business and/or per-
sonal affairs in order
 Suddenly giving away one’s possessions
 Overindulging in drugs or alcohol
 Suddenly becoming much happier after
being depressed for a time
Note that some of these classic signs, including
talking about suicide, making statements about life
no longer being worth living, and overindulging in
drugs or alcohol, are also common signs of griev-
ing the death of a loved one. Keep this in mind
when dealing with someone who’s grieving: These
signs may be nothing more than normal grieving,
but they also may indicate that the bereaved
person is seriously contemplating suicide.

Dealing with the public and religious disapproval of suicide can be very
tough indeed. Try to keep in mind that this disapproval stems from a deep
respect for life that in no way demeans or denies the many worthwhile quali-
ties in your loved one that you now miss so intensely. As much as possible,
keep your focus on your loved one, the relationship you shared, and the grief
that you now feel, and let any criticism by others about the manner of death
be their concern and not yours.
Resources to Help You Deal with
Different Kinds of Death
There are many resources to turn to for help dealing with the different kinds
of death (anticipated, sudden, and suicide) discussed in this chapter. I begin
with a short list of the Web addresses and hotline phone numbers for three
main nonprofit foundations that can answer your questions regarding hos-

Books
The books on sudden death, caregiving, and suicide are numerous (especially
on caregiving and suicide). I’ve boiled down this rather extensive book list to
the following favorites:
 I Wasn’t Ready to Say Goodbye: Surviving, Coping, and Healing
after the Sudden Death of a Loved One by Brook Noel and Pamela D.
Blair (Champion Press Ltd.): This is a comprehensive book on grieving
the sudden death of a loved one. The authors cover the emotional and
physical aspects of grieving a sudden loss, the Kübler-Ross stages of
grieving, ways to overcome blocks to grieving, and suggestions for relat-
ing your story to others. This book covers losses of a wide range of
people, including parents, partners, children, siblings, and friends.
 Caregiving: The Spiritual Journey of Love, Loss, and Renewal by
Beth Witrogen McLeod (Wiley): This is both a very practical book on
being the caregiver for a loved one and an inspirational work. McLeod
covers topics that range from a definition of what family caregiving is to
caregiving as a rite of passage. The author includes basic action steps
that you can follow in addition to the text that’s intended to inform and
motivate and encourage you at every turn in your caregiving journey.
 The Fearless Caregiver: How to Get the Best Care for Your Loved
Ones and Still Have a Life of Your Own by Gary Barg (Capitol Books):
In this book, you get great practical information on being an effective
caregiver for a loved one. In addition, it contains vital information on
ways that you can take care of yourself and avoid the all-too-common
burnout that so many caregivers suffer.
 The Comfort of Home: A Complete Guide for Caregivers by Maria M.
Meyer and Paula Derr (Care Trust Publications): This illustrated book is
a basic and practical guide to providing care for a loved one at home. It’s
divided into three parts: “Getting Ready,” with information on what it
takes to do caregiving at home, how to get in-home help, dealing with
financial matters, and procuring the necessary equipment and supplies;
“Day by Day,” with information on how to plan daily activities as well as
deal with emergencies and avoid burnout; and “Additional Resources,”
with a glossary and bibliography along with a list of common abbrevia-
tions used in the healthcare profession and medical specialists whom
you may want to consult.
 No Time to Say Goodbye: Surviving the Suicide of a Loved One by
Carla Fine (Main Street Books): In 1989, the author’s husband took his
own life after being deeply depressed over the deaths of his parents.
This practical and inspiring book on surviving the suicide of a loved one
written from the perspective of a suicide survivor is at the same time
both sensitive and informative.
47
Chapter 2: Relating Grief to the Manner of Death

 Sanity & Grace: A Journey of Suicide, Survival, and Strength by
Judy Collins (Penguin): In 1992, folk singer Judy Collin’s son Clark com-
mitted suicide. This book contains a moving account of a mother’s
attempt to make sense of and come to grips with her adult son’s death
by his own hand. Most of the chapters begin with personal journal
entries covering the period from 1997 to 2001 that the author then uses
to discuss particular challenges associated with surviving the suicide of
a loved one.
If you’re a fan of the For Dummies series (as I’m sure you are judging by 
the fact that you’re reading this book!), be sure to check out Dr. Rachelle
Zukerman’s Eldercare For Dummies (Wiley) for good, solid information about
caregiving and Alzheimer’s For Dummies by Patricia Smith, Mary M. Kenan, et
al. (Wiley) for tons of invaluable information about dealing with the care and
treatment of this disease.
Online resources
Online resources for this chapter include three categories of Web sites: those
that support family and professional caregivers, those that help survivors of
a violent death or homicide, and those that help prevent suicide and support
the survivors of suicide. In these categories, I recommend that you visit the
following:
 Today’s Caregiver Magazine at www.caregiver.com: Gary Barg, 
the author of The Fearless Caregiver (see the preceding list of books) is
the editor-in-chief of Today’s Caregiver magazine. In addition to giving
you information about the magazine and its articles and enabling you 
to obtain a subscription or buy back issues, this site contains informa-
tional links. You can link to information on particular ailments such as
Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia and on particular challenges for care-
givers such as mobility and long-term care. You also find a page with
links to regional resources to help support your caregiving.
 National Alliance for Caregiving at www.caregiving.org: This site is
designed for both family caregivers and professionals. It contains useful
information on Medicare resources (including the Medicare prescription
drug benefit) along with caregiving tips.

t’s entirely fitting to begin the investigation into common types of pro-
found losses and the kind of grief they produce by looking closely at the
loss of parents and the significant effects of this type of loss. The loss of par-
ents is one of the most common types of loss that anyone is likely to experi-
ence in his life.
Surprisingly, it’s also a loss whose effects many people underestimate. This
may well be because most people (fortunately) don’t lose their parents until
they’re adults, often with children of their own. As a result, they assume that
they’re of an age to be more prepared for such a loss. Unfortunately, what-
ever the age, the loss of a connection to one’s matrix can rank among the
most powerful and life-altering experiences, setting in motion a number of
momentous changes.
This chapter, therefore, begins with an exploration of the nature of the rela-
tionship with your parents that’s severed upon their departure and the onset
of feeling orphaned. The chapter concludes with an investigation into the
impact that this break in generations may bring, depending upon your age,
the manner of the loss, and the relative health of the relationship at the time
the loss occurs. It also looks at the challenges of dealing with and helping a
surviving parent before listing resources you can turn to get to more informa-
tion and help on dealing with this very challenging type of loss.

Looking at Parental Roles
At their best, parents provide us with a whole lot more than just their 
DNA. They play a number of vital roles that you can divide into two basic 
categories:
 Nurturing, which includes all the ways parents protect, provide, and
rear their children, fostering in them a sense of security and well-being.
In their roles as nurturers, parents provide a roof over your head, food
in your belly, and shoes on your feet. They also tend to your wounds,
both physical and emotional, wipe the tears from your eyes, and get you
back on your feet after suffering setbacks, both real and imagined, as
well as watch over your development.
 Maturing, which includes all the ways parents teach, encourage, and
challenge their children, fostering in them a sense of responsibility and
independence. In their roles as maturers, parents teach you to walk and
talk and even play with you. They also scold you when you do wrong
and guide you in rectifying your less-than-stellar deeds. They act as role
models after whom you can mold your character, as well as coaches
who encourage you to take responsibility for your actions and challenge
the assumptions, both inflated and understated, that you hold about
yourself.
Your parents tend to perform more nurturing roles when you’re an infant 
and young child and more helpless; they perform more maturing roles when
you’re an older child and teenager and less helpless. But it’s also true that
they continue to play these roles in some measure throughout your entire
life, even after you’ve left the nest and are living on your own.
Even after they no longer pay your rent, put the food on your table, and keep
clothes on your back, you still know that your parents are there if you get in a
jam, and they would again provide some of these things should you really
need them. And although they may no longer be able to prescribe the conse-
quences you endure as a result of your actions, chances are good (almost too
good) that they still give you advice, both asked for and unsolicited, on what
course of action you should take, and they continue to care what you do and
what happens to you all your life.
When parents don’t excel at nurturing and maturing, this lack of good parent-
ing greatly impacts your grieving their loss. The death of such parents can
heighten your awareness of what you didn’t get and will never receive from
them. See “Dealing with the death of an absent or abusive parent” later in this
chapter for more on this subject.

Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Feeling orphaned at any age
The concept of being orphaned carries two meanings: being deprived of
one’s parents and being deprived of some protection and advantage. The first
definition is normally applied to children who lose their parents, on account
of the parents’ death or inability to care for them, and who then grow up in
the care of others. The second definition for being orphaned is one that I
think applies to all who lose parents at whatever age and in whatever 
circumstances.
When you lose your parents as a young child, you’re most likely to feel bereft
of the basic security and well-being that otherwise may have been yours.
When you lose your parents as an adult, you’re less likely to feel bereft of
basic security and well-being, although you may well miss terribly your par-
ents’ guidance and feedback (even if you didn’t always listen to their advice).
Reversing roles with aging parents
If you’re fortunate enough to see your parents into their golden years, you
may experience some role reversal as you and your siblings become care-
givers for your parents. Just as in earlier days your parents provided you
with shelter and protected you from harm, now you’re called upon to provide
them these things. Depending upon the state of your parents’ health, you
may also be called upon to provide them with the necessary encouragement
and challenges to foster in them a sense of self-reliance and some semblance
of independence.
This form of parenting your own parents often marks the beginning of a gen-
erational changing of the guard, a process in which the younger generation of
the family assumes the roles of the older one. It also can mark the decisive
53
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents
Bereft and bereaved
The word “bereft” is actually an alternative
form of the past tense of the verb “bereave”
(bereaved). Bereave comes from the Old
English verb “bereafian” meaning “to be robbed
or plundered.” Although bereavement has
come to describe the state of being that’s
brought on by the loss of a loved one through
death, you may want to keep in mind its original
meaning of being robbed, as this may be exactly
how you feel.

end of your own extended childhood, especially if you don’t have your own
children and therefore aren’t parents in your own right.
Because so few people, even those blessed with tons of relatives, can tap into
nonstop support from extended family, providing adequate care for ailing and
aging parents can be one of the most challenging and difficult tasks you face
before their actual passing. The situation becomes all the more challenging
when the care must be provided by paid caregivers or can’t be given in the
home, meaning that a trustworthy and affordable skilled-nursing facility must
be found.
The stress of being a caregiver and dealing with anticipatory grief is an
important subject.
The Loss of Grandparents as One’s 
Initial Experience with Grief
For many, the death of a grandparent marks a person’s very first experience
with grief in the immediate family. It may also be one’s very first up-close and
personal experience with death.
While the impact of the death may fall mostly on your mom if the grandpar-
ent was one of her parents and on your dad if the grandparent was one of his
parents, the loss can be expected to affect the entire nuclear family.
If you’re fairly young when your grandparent dies, the way your immediate
family deals with the death and the way the parent who lost his or her parent
grieves the loss can greatly influence both your views toward death and your
understanding of grief.
In my case, my maternal grandfather was the first person in my immediate
family to die. His death occurred when I was about 10 years old. I didn’t know
him very well because my maternal grandparents had divorced when I was a
baby and my family visited him only occasionally. His funeral was the first
one I attended, and it had a great impact on me even though I wasn’t particu-
larly sad at my grandfather’s passing given that I didn’t know him all that
well. After the funeral, I noticed that my mother was rather quiet and intro-
spective for about a week and thereafter seemed to be unaffected.
My second experience with death and grief in the family came with the pass-
ing of my maternal grandmother some years later. After divorcing my grand-
father, she had moved to Pasadena, giving real meaning to the Beach Boys’
54
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

hit “The Little Old Lady From Pasadena,” but visited my family back in Chicago
regularly for extended periods. As a result, I became very close to her as she
cared for me when I was a young child. When my grandmother became criti-
cally ill, my mother and aunt went to California, where they stayed until my
grandmother died and was buried.
After returning home from the funeral, my mother responded to her mother’s
death more or less as she had to her father’s. Although somewhat more
openly emotional this time, her depression seemed to last no more than a
week. My emotional response to this death, however, was not so measured.
This was my first experience with grief, and I was amazed and confused by
my feelings. Also, because my feelings of sadness seemed to be so much
stronger than my mother’s, I figured that there must be something wrong
with me for taking the death so hard (after all, my mother had just lost her
mother and was able to cope with the loss so much better than I was).
These initial experiences with death in the loss of my maternal grandparents
and my family’s response (including my own) to them were quite misleading.
I took away the mistaken impression that the death of one’s parents, pro-
vided that it occurred in the natural course of time when they were seniors
and the children grown, was not that big of a deal. It was something that you
could get over in a relatively short time and that had no lasting effects.
I didn’t discover how misguided this assumption was until I lost my own par-
ents many years later — my dad when I was just about to turn 40 and my
mom a decade later.
Exploring the Impact of Losing Parents
The impact of the death of your parents shouldn’t be minimized. The actual
extent of the grief it produces for you depends upon a great many factors,
which can include:
 Your age at the time of your parent’s death
 Your gender and that of your parent
 The intimacy of your relationship with your parent
 The number of brothers and sisters you have and your birth order
These factors can combine to magnify the loss and extend the grief. For
example, if you’re a girl who loses her mother when you’re young and you’re
also the eldest of several siblings, you may not only find yourself dealing with
55
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents

the loss of your mother’s advice and guidance as you grow up but also con-
tinually struggling with your own attempts to mother your younger siblings.
If you’re a boy who’s an only child and who loses your dad, with whom
you’ve had a persistently strained relationship as an adult, you may find
yourself dealing not only with the feelings of being orphaned and alone but
also with all the unresolved issues between you and your father.
Experiencing the death 
of a parent as a child
Experiencing the death of a parent is traumatic at any age, but it’s particu-
larly harrowing for young children. With the death of a parent, young children
are deprived not only of the guidance and love that that parent would have
provided as the children grew up but also the sense of security that the
parent’s ongoing presence in the home would have bestowed. More often
than not, the child feels terribly vulnerable, especially when the death is
accompanied by a relocation of the family.
Because one of the two people the child counted on being with him and sup-
porting him (in all aspects) until adulthood is now gone, it’s not at all unusual
for the child to cling to the surviving parent. The child can easily become
quite concerned with this parent’s health, afraid that, should the parent fail
to take care of himself or herself, the child will be without anyone to support
him and be truly orphaned.
Although they may never fully go away, these feelings of vulnerability are
often alleviated to some extent by the grieving process, especially if the
child’s able to share this process with his surviving parent and siblings. In sit-
uations where the surviving parent has great difficulty grieving the loss of his
or her spouse and continuing to function as a parent, it’s not unusual for the
child to try to step in and care for the parent. This role reversal, of course,
puts an undue and unfair burden on the child, while running the risk of sti-
fling the child’s ability to grieve the loss. In families with many siblings, the
oldest child may also try to care for and parent the younger children in an
attempt to lighten the load on the surviving parent.
Grief can manifest itself in many different ways in children, some of which are
physical and others psychological. Also, guilt over the death is quite common,
especially in younger children. See Chapter 7 for details on the ways in which
children deal with grief and suggestions of ways to help them through their
grief.

Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Integrating the grief as you mature
The grief that accompanies the loss of a parent as a child (as opposed to
such a loss as an adult) is made more complex by the fact that the child has
to integrate this loss into his life as part of growing up and becoming an
adult. As the child reaches different plateaus in his life and experiences the
rites of passage that mark the transition from childhood to adulthood (such
as graduations, communion, bar mitzvah, getting a driver’s license, and
proms), he does so without the parent. In the face of the parent’s absence,
more often than not, the event becomes another opportunity to revisit the
grief and another challenge to integrate it into the child’s life.
The events that a child doesn’t get to share with the lost parent don’t stop
with adulthood. As the child moves through adulthood, several salient events
are opportunities to revisit the grief. Chief among them are marriage (espe-
cially for girls who’ve lost their dads and have to ask someone else to give
them away during the ceremony) and the births of grandchildren.
Reaching the age of your deceased parent
Perhaps the most salient milestone for a person who’s lost a parent as a child
is reaching the same age that the parent was when she or he died. For many
people who’ve experienced parental loss as a child, this birthday is the most
poignant they’ve ever experienced. It often touches off a whole new round of
longing for and reminiscing over the lost parent, but, more importantly, it
also initiates intense soul-searching about the future.
The introspection that accompanies reaching the age of the deceased parent
seems to be particularly true for people who are the same gender as the
parent who died. In this case, many report genuine surprise that they’ve lived
as long as their deceased parents. Some report even doubting they’ll live
beyond the age at which the parent passed away and feeling apprehension
over their own imminent death. Even when this fear isn’t present, they still
wonder about their futures and take the anniversary as an occasion for
taking stock of their lives and questioning the direction of the next stage of
their lives.
If you lost a parent as a child and are now reaching the age at which he or she
died, you may want to make this an exceptional birthday celebration in
which you honor your deceased parent and his or her accomplishments
alongside your own. You can use this special occasion to take stock of your
life up to now and decide whether or not its direction needs some fine-tuning.
57
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents

Experiencing the death of 
a parent as an adult
When your parent dies when you’re an adult — especially one who’s pretty
well established and has at least reached middle age — and your parent is a
senior, many people assume that the grief that accompanies the loss will not
be all that devastating and life altering. While it’s true that adults who lose
their parents don’t face the same challenges as children, especially when it
comes to security and guidance in growing up, this doesn’t mean that they
get a free ride.
For many people, the death of a parent is the most devastating loss they
experience in their lives, unless and until they experience the death of a
spouse or partner. Moreover, the extent of the grief attached to the loss often
comes as a surprise even for people who are very close to their parents and
part of a very close-knit family.
In addition to the shock over the depth of the grief, many are also dumb-
founded by the many ways in which the loss of a parent as an adult affects
their own self-image as well as their relations with their spouses and other
family members. For some reason, the assumption is that because you’re an
adult who’s relatively well established in life, the passing of a parent will not
(or should not) have anywhere near the same kind of devastating effect that
it sometimes does.
The end of childhood
You may have long regarded yourself as an adult, functionally independent of
your parents, and you may even be a parent of your own children. Neverthe-
less, it’s not until the day that the first parent passes away that you feel that
your childhood has come to an abrupt and final end.
With that loss, you come to appreciate that the mantle of adulthood has now
really fallen squarely on your shoulders. This understanding can dawn in a
couple of ways:
 It can come with the understanding that you (and your siblings) must
now assume full responsibility for the surviving parent.
 It can come with the comprehension that your generation is in the
process of moving up a notch and is now not only the “responsible” one
but the next in line to face the Grim Reaper.
Following the loss of the second parent, some people — especially only chil-
dren (otherwise known as singletons) and lastborns — can experience feelings
58
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

of both being lost and liberated at the same time. They feel lost because
they’re now truly orphaned, and, in the case of singletons, they really have
no one in the immediate nuclear family upon whom to rely. They feel liber-
ated because for the first time they’re truly in a position to make all their own
decisions independent of any parental assessment. (Of course, this feeling of
liberation also can be quite intimidating if the adult child continued to be
rather dependent upon his parents until their demise.)
It’s not unusual for adults who’ve lost a parent with whom they shared freely
and were particularly close to experience feelings of uncertainty along with
the usual feelings of sadness. This uncertainty, however, is quite unlike the
kind experienced by a child who’s lost a parent; it stems from missing a trusted
confidant and guide rather than from losing a protector and benefactor.
In my own case, I continue to miss consulting with my dad over big decisions
in my life. As an adult, I came to rely upon my discussions with him over mat-
ters that I considered particularly crucial. These discussions helped me clar-
ify the issue at hand as well as get some advice from someone not only who
knew me very well but also who I had no doubt always had my best interests
at heart. After he died, I didn’t have anyone whom I could count on in quite
the same manner (even among close friends whose advice I trusted). Over
time and as part of grieving his death, I realized that I learned to internalize
my father’s advice; by thinking through what my dad may have counseled me
when I faced a tough decision in my life, I had developed a way of keeping
him alive for me and keeping in communication with him.
Many adults report that, after the death of their parents, they finally come to
appreciate all that their parents did for them and meant to them. They also
report that they undergo a process of soul-searching and a kind of identity
crisis, at the end of which they finally feel that they’ve really grown up and
are finally ready to completely assume adult responsibilities. Part of this
soul-searching can mean coming to terms with the fact that they’ve lost the
possibility of getting what they felt deprived of and wanted so badly in the
relationship.
Changes to your relationships within the family
It pretty much goes without saying that the death of a parent is very disrup-
tive to the immediate nuclear family (that is, you, the surviving parent, and
your siblings), even when all surviving children are grown and living indepen-
dently. The shock of the death tests the family system, emphasizing both its
strengths and weaknesses:
 In a close-knit family, the death can bring the immediate family closer
together than it’s ever been before.
 In a family prone to some level of dysfunction, the death of a parent can
expose existing fractures and reignite old rivalries, sometimes between
the surviving children and the surviving parent but more often between
59
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents

siblings. These outbreaks of tension can arise during the funeral as well
as later on in the course of trying to aid the surviving parent in settling
the deceased parent’s estate and dealing with the pain of the loss of his
or her partner (see “Helping the Surviving Parent,” later in this chapter).
 In the best of situations, the death actually spurs estranged siblings to
reconcile and helps to mend fences between those siblings who’ve
grown apart after leaving home.
 In the worst of situations, the death can provoke old jealousies and
drive new wedges between siblings who haven’t been on the best terms
since childhood.
 If the deceased parent acted as a power broker or peacemaker among
the adult children, his or her absence may lead to a certain amount of
sibling infighting as the family system attempts to reestablish equilib-
rium and one or more of the survivors attempt to fill this role. As part of
this process, the surviving children may get caught up in critiquing their
relationship to the deceased parent (“I was always Dad’s favorite”) as
well as in engaging in a blame game regarding their siblings (“You were
never there for her”).
During this time, it’s especially important to guard against ganging up on
a particular sibling, especially if he or she has been particularly absent
in the parent’s life or has been tagged a “black sheep.” This kind of
scapegoating isn’t destructive to the family system but is very counter-
productive when it comes to your own grieving process.
Changes to your relationships with your spouse
In addition to affecting changes in your relationships with your siblings, suf-
fering the death of a parent as an adult may also lead you to experience a
change in your relationship with your own spouse or partner. Many adults
who’ve lost a parent to whom they were close then turn to their spouses not
only for comfort in their grief but also for the approval that used to come
from that parent (even if the adult child didn’t particularly crave this kind of
endorsement when the parent was alive). Of course, this greater emotional
dependence upon your spouse or partner can cut both ways: It can either
bring you closer to your partner or drive a wedge between you.
If, after losing a parent, you find yourself needing your spouse’s praise almost
as much if not more than his or her empathy, you may want to consider the
role that your deceased parent played in cultivating your self-esteem. If the
lost parent was vital in this process, discuss this situation with your partner
and let him or her know what may be happening. That way, you have more of
a chance of getting your emotional needs met and less of a chance of alienat-
ing your partner in the bargain.
60
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Losing a parent through divorce
Divorce may not bring with it the finality that the death of a parent does, but
for many children, divorce produces a sense of loss that must be grieved in
very much the same manner. For most children of divorce, the breakup of the
family only disrupts the influence of one of the parents (more likely than not,
the father). In some instances, however, the divorce ends the parent’s inter-
action in the child’s life, effectively ending his influence and, for all intents
and purposes, rendering him deceased. The only mitigating factor with a loss
of a parent through divorce rather than death is the fact that because the
parent isn’t physically deceased, the possibility of reconciliation and reunion
is always possible.
Grieving the loss of a parent as a result of divorce is often made more difficult
by the fact that divorce is frequently accompanied by a level of animosity and
recriminations that, thankfully, rarely attends a parent’s death. Often the
child of divorce doesn’t feel safe expressing his sorrow and acknowledging
his grief in such an environment. The child also may feel compelled to take
the side of the parent with whom he stays to show his loyalty and as a way of
helping that parent through her pain.
Keep in mind that children, especially young children, are prone to blame
themselves in some way for the breakup of the family just as they’re inclined
to find blame for the death of a parent (see Chapter 7). This aspect of guilt
can be a form of questioning the parent’s love for the child as well as a mech-
anism for explaining the situation. Regardless, it adds another layer to the
grieving process and must be dealt with before moving on to dealing with the
sadness over the loss.
Dealing with the death of an 
absent or abusive parent
One of the most difficult parental losses to grieve is one in which the deceased
parent was primarily absent from your life or, even worse, abusive in some
manner. Both situations bring their own extra difficulties to grieving,
although the feelings that they evoke are very different.
In terms of a parent who’s been mostly or totally absent from your life, if you
never had a chance to know that parent, let alone come to depend on and
love him or her, it’s impossible to really grieve the loss. You never got the
proper chance to develop a deep connection with the parent, and therefore
you can’t expect his or her death to represent a profound loss for you (as
would the death of the parent who did stay in your life).
61
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents

This doesn’t mean that you don’t feel any sadness or remorse in regard to the
death, however. You may well find yourself extremely sad and going through
all the stages associated with the normal grieving for a parent. In this case,
though, it’s likely that you’re grieving the parent’s absence from your life more
than his or her death. The loss in this case isn’t the bond with the parent but
the lack of the bond. All the feelings of remorse and shame that you associate
with the abandonment are likely to surface and become among the primary
things you have to deal with in order to process the grief you feel.
In terms of a parent who has been psychologically, physically, or sexually
abusive, the death may actually represent a relief rather than any kind of
great sadness. This personal sense of relief may be accompanied by a larger
sense of cosmic or divine justice.
This sense of relief can too easily turn into feelings of guilt. These feelings of
guilt may play directly into any misplaced feelings of responsibility that the
abused child harbors regarding the abuse, compounding the abuse and com-
plicating the grieving.
Other family members can make grieving an abusive parent all the more diffi-
cult if the family never properly or openly acknowledges the abuse. The family
may underrate or even totally deny the abuse so as to protect the public
legacy of the deceased parent. This denial leads to even more pain for the
child or children who suffered the abuse to process as part of their grieving.
As TV’s Dr. Phil is so wont to remind us all, the person who was made to
suffer abuse is never responsible for that abuse. That dishonor rests entirely
upon the shoulders of the abuser. It’s important to remember this little
truism if you’re someone dealing with the death of an abusive parent so as
not to be tempted to take on some of the accountability for the abuse, espe-
cially if the rest of the family is in deep denial.
Like children of absent parents, the children of abusive parents may end up
grieving not so much the deceased parent as the lack of love and nurturing in
life. In addition to mourning this loss of love, the children undoubtedly also
grieve the loss of innocence and trust that they suffered as a direct result of
parental abuse.
Because grieving an abusive parent is sure to stir up your emotions sur-
rounding the abuse, this is one of the few times when you may be better off
putting aside the grieving until after you have a chance to process your feel-
ings about the abuse. Consider seeking counseling from someone who spe-
cializes in recovering from child abuse before you join a grief support group
or seek out a grief counselor.
62
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Helping the Surviving Parent
In addition to grieving your own loss of a parent, you may find yourself in the
position of having to help your surviving parent cope with the loss of his or
her spouse (see Chapter 4). You also may have to help settle your deceased
parent’s estate, help your surviving parent manage the financial affairs (espe-
cially if the parent relied entirely on his or her spouse to take care of these
matters), and even relocate the parent to a more appropriate living situation.
In some cases, you may even have to go so far as to provide care for the sur-
viving parent, especially in the case of an older parent who’s ailing or frail at
the time of the spouse’s death. This care may take the form of having the sur-
viving parent come to live with you or finding affordable and trustworthy
housing where your parent can receive professional care.
Helping your surviving parent 
cope with the loss
Although you typically look to your parents as your guides through the diffi-
cult situations in life, this is one case where, assuming you’re an adult, you
may be called upon to take the lead. The surviving parent is often in no shape
to guide you and is in need of all the help you can give. This can be especially
true of older parents for whom the intimacy and long duration of the relation-
ship make it nearly impossible for the surviving parent to conceive of life
without his or her spouse. (This was true for my parents, who had just cele-
brated their 59th wedding anniversary when my father died.)
The best thing you can do in such a situation is support your surviving
parent in his grief as a person who has lost his partner in life while you honor
your own grief as a child who has lost a parent. Many times, providing sup-
port simply means staying in close touch with your parent and offering to
listen. Other times, it may mean reminiscing about your lost loved one and
actively mourning his or her passing.
The most important thing, however, is to stay as present as possible with
your parent’s grief while at the same time acknowledging your own. Because
you’re both mourning a great loss, you should be able to express and exchange
feelings and remembrances about your lost loved one relatively freely. You
know better than most your parent’s comfort level when it comes to express-
ing his or her feelings, so share as much as feels right, and don’t pressure for
more interaction in grief.
63
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents

Suffice it say, grieving a parent is not the time for recriminations and fact-
finding missions. No matter how great your need is to explore a topic involving
the deceased parent, leave it alone if you know very well that your surviving
parent is uncomfortable with the topic. There’s a time later in the grieving
process when you’re actively incorporating the loss into your lives when it’s
not only appropriate but often helpful to share and explore the less saint-like
aspects of the deceased.
When the loss is fresh and the grief acute, share the endearing stories and
memories that highlight what your lost loved one means to you and just what
you’re missing and mourning. When you’re dealing with a parent for whom
the loss is just too raw and for whom such reminisces bring too much pain,
find a relative or a mutual friend with whom to share these memories. You
can still support your surviving parent by just sitting with him or her and
being there in silence.
Helping the surviving parent 
manage affairs
One of the most effective ways to help your surviving parent is to help him or
her manage financial and practical affairs — from helping to make the funeral
arrangements and arrange for the disposition of the deceased’s personal
effects to balancing the checkbook and paying the monthly bills.
The degree of management help that a parent needs and can benefit from
depends upon several factors:
 Parent’s age and health: An 80-year-old parent in failing health will need
more assistance than a 60-year-old parent in excellent health.
 Parent’s gender and roles in the home: A mother who has never
worked a day outside of the house and who relied on her husband to
take care of all the financial affairs will require a lot more assistance than
a father who worked in an office until the day he retired. So too, a father
who never cooked a meal in his life will require more guidance and help
in the kitchen than a father who was close to being a gourmet chef.
 Parent’s personality and level of self-assurance: A gregarious parent
with tons of friends in the community and who tackles every challenge
with gusto will need less help than a shy, retiring parent who goes into
new experiences kicking and screaming.
64
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

This section is about helping your surviving parent manage his or her finan-
cial affairs, not managing the affairs for the parent. It’s very important that
you take on no more than necessary. A parent’s sense of independence and
self-sufficiency is always an important element in his or her survival and can
ultimately go a long way in helping him or her successfully grieve the loss.
Providing care for the surviving parent
With elderly parents, it may be the case that, after the death of one parent,
the surviving one is no longer capable of living on his or her own. This is
especially true when the parent who dies acted as a caregiver for the surviv-
ing parent. In this situation, you face a choice between providing the care for
the surviving parent in your own home or that of one of your siblings or find-
ing a facility that can provide professional care.
Your decision on how to provide necessary care for the surviving parent 
is primarily based on economic and logistical factors. Senior housing, 
independent-living centers, and skilled-nursing facilities may well be beyond
the family’s means. On the other hand, your home or those of any siblings
willing to take in Mom or Dad may not be large enough or properly equipped
for your parent to live in comfortably. For example, a second-floor bedroom
may be out of the question depending on your parent’s mobility.
Caring for the surviving parent in your own home
Becoming your parent’s caregiver can be more rewarding than you ever antic-
ipated, bringing you and the other members of your family (especially your
children) closer to your parent than ever before. Even so, caregiving may be
something that you’d love to do to repay your parent but realistically is
beyond your ability to provide.
Even if your home has room for your surviving parent and a layout that
accommodates his or her needs, you still have to look long and hard at your
willingness and ability to become your parent’s caregiver. Depending upon
the health and temperament of your parent after the loss, the state of your
relationship with the parent, and your own state of affairs, this undertaking
can be a whole lot more challenging than you ever expected.
You have to consider all angles of a caregiving situation in order to be able to
decide what’s best not only for your parent but also for you and the others in
your household. You definitely need to consult with the other members of
your immediate family, including your spouse or partner and your own chil-
dren. Remember that everyone’s life will be affected by this decision, so
65
Chapter 3: The Loss of Parents

everyone needs to be on the same page. Also, be sure that your mom or dad
isn’t feeling as though she or he will be a burden on the household and is
genuinely okay with the new living situation.
Finding appropriate independent housing for a surviving parent
Many people have a justified abhorrence of nursing homes and recoil from
the thought of ever putting their parents in one. As a hospice patient-care
volunteer, I’ve had the opportunity to visit many of the local skilled-nursing
and independent-living facilities in my area, some of which are ritzier than
others and, more important, better staffed. I’ve found in every case that the
staff-to-patient ratio is much more important to the residents’ well-being than
the quality of the physical facilities and planned activities, although some-
times these two things go hand in hand.
When trying to locate suitable independent housing for a surviving parent, you
first need to consider whether or not your parent can live in an independent-
living center or requires a skilled-nursing facility. Here’s a brief description 
of each:
 Independent-living centers for seniors usually provide apartment-type
living with access to shared meals in a common dining area, transporta-
tion to and from doctor’s appointments, planned activities, and some
sort of professional and building security on the site.
 Skilled-nursing facilities provide completely assisted living with around-
the-clock professional care usually in rooms equipped with two beds.
Meals are served in a common dining room for residents who are inde-
pendent enough to make use of it and at the bedside of those residents
who are not. Also, there are scads of planned activities for those who
want and are able to participate.
When locating suitable independent housing for your parent, do a back-
ground check on the facility, get information about the security it provides,
and inquire about the staff-to-patient ratio it maintains. In addition, you should
talk with other residents (or families who are visiting residents) about their
experiences with the facility and its staff.
Resources for Healing 
the Loss of a Parent
If you find that my coverage in this chapter of the loss of parents and the kind
of grief that can result has raised more questions, you’re fortunate that many
66

other resources are available to answer your questions and get you con-
nected to the right people. This section presents resources — books and Web
sites — on losing a parent with which I’m personally familiar.
Books
I recommend two books on the loss of parents:
 Losing Your Parents, Finding Your Self: The Defining Turning Point
of Adult Life by Victoria Secunda (Hyperion): This book is based on the
responses to a survey on parental loss by 94 respondents. Secunda care-
fully examines the aftermath of losing parents in terms of one’s self-
image and career as well as one’s relationship with others, including
siblings and partners.
I highly recommend this book for adults who have lost their parents and
now find themselves searching for new identities or struggling to finally
grow up.
 Never the Same: Coming to Terms with the Death of a Parent by
Donna Schuurman (St. Martin’s Press): Donna Schuurman is the execu-
tive director of the Dougy Center for Grieving Children & Families in
Portland, Oregon (one of the recommended online resources in the fol-
lowing section), which helps both adults and young people through the
process of grieving their parents’ passing. The great thing about this
book is that it’s designed somewhat as a workbook: Each chapter’s full
of questions and blank note pages for the reader to write his or her
responses.
Online resources
You can consult many online resources for help in coping with the loss of a
parent either as a child or an adult.

 Dealing with the practical aspects of partner loss
 Findings ways to keep love alive
 Getting help to heal the loss of a partner
I
f finding a partner with whom you can share your days is one of life’s
greatest rewards, then losing a partner with whom you shared your years
surely has to be one of its greatest sorrows. Whether through divorce or
death, the loss of a partner or spouse has major emotional consequences.
The chapter begins with an examination of both the spiritual and practical
aspects of sharing your life with that special someone. It then moves on to 
an evaluation of the many psychological, practical, and social challenges
involved in enduring the loss of one’s best friend who coincidently happens
to be a key breadwinner or parent.
The chapter concludes with the challenge of recovering love and companion-
ship in one’s life after the loss of a spouse or partner. To help you with this
important process, you get a list of additional resources for healing the loss
of a spouse or partner.
Note: The term “spouse” usually refers to just a husband or wife in an offi-
cially authorized marriage, and “partner” usually refers to a significant other
of either gender in some other type of less official relationship. For purposes
of this chapter, however, I use these two terms interchangeably.

Love, Companionship, and Partnership
Nothing quite compares to the feelings of joy and fulfillment that come from
finding true love. This is all the more true when that love leads to a long-term
relationship with someone who becomes your best and most intimate friend.
Understandably for many people, finding this kind of love and establishing
this kind of special relationship ranks as one of life’s most important goals.
True love, however, is only one part of the total equation. Most couples who
are able to establish a long-term relationship find that the companionship
and partnership become every bit as important as the romance. Over time,
the friendship and trust you build with your partner can become the defining
aspects of the relationship.
Romantic partnerships often fulfill many different needs in people’s lives; the
most obvious are financial, social, and sexual. And who does what in meeting
these needs goes a long way toward determining the types of roles that both
you and your partner play in the relationship. When you lose your partner
and the relationship dissolves, these needs remain, and the roles you were so
used to playing are thrown up for grabs.
Losing a love, especially a true, long-standing love, either through a breakup
or death is one of the most heart-rending experiences in life. In fact, for many,
the first taste of profound grief comes as the result of losing a loved one not
through death but rather through a breakup. And the feelings of helpless-
ness, despondency, and suffering naturally experienced at the breakup of a
loving relationship are magnified many times with the death of someone with
whom one intimately shares one’s life.
The Impact of Losing Your Spouse
Your spouse is your rock, and when you lose him or her, you probably feel as
though you’ve lost the very foundation of your life. In the loss, you’re bereft
of your closest friend with whom you undoubtedly shared the most intimate
and important aspects of your life. Therefore, this type of loss is quite devas-
tating on many levels.
In some ways, losing your partner, especially when you’ve been with that
person for a long time, is like losing a twin brother or sister (see Chapter 5
for specifics on losing a sibling who’s a twin). As the years roll on and you
share more and more experiences together, you and your spouse think and
act more like a single unit and less like two individuals; you’re able to finish
70
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

each other’s sentences and often anticipate each other’s wants and needs
without a single word being spoken. In the end, people may even mistake you
and your spouse for brother and sister when they first meet you.
The loss of this kind of cohesiveness is difficult beyond measure. Instead of
feeling like you’ve lost a person you love deeply, it may feel more as though
you’ve lost a part of yourself. In fact, in mourning the loss of a long-time
spouse, you may mourn not only the lost loved one but also the severing of
the greater self of which your spouse was such a vital part.
This section explores the emotional impact of losing your partner in one of
two ways: as the result of a breakup or divorce and as the result of death.
Divorce and death both represent profound losses that bring about their own
types of grief and their own ways of grieving.
Experiencing loss through divorce
When most people think of grieving a spouse, they naturally think of the grief
that comes from the death of one of the partners. In fact, given the high per-
centage of marriages that end in divorce, you’re more likely to suffer the grief
of a breakup than the grief that comes from the death of a spouse.
The impact of anger
The emotional impact of losing a partner through divorce differs from losing
one through death mostly in the amount of upfront anger involved. Although
some divorces are completely amicable, they usually include a great deal of
disappointment, frustration, and regret. These angry emotions may have
been present some time before the actual separation as well as being present
in abundance during the divorce proceedings.
Along with disappointment with the failure of the relationship, many people
also experience sadder emotions normally associated with grieving the loss
of a loved one; these emotions can include depressed feelings of isolation
and deep sorrow over the loss.
Anger is often the overriding emotion during divorce, and you may need to
use the energy of your anger to get you through all the practical and legal
aspects of your divorce. If anger dominates, however, keep in mind that you
need to deal with it and ultimately dispense with it before you can complete
your grieving this loss (see Chapter 14 for suggestions on how to process
your feelings).
71
Chapter 4: The Loss of Partners and Spouses

The stages of grief still apply
Grieving the loss from divorce often includes many of the classic Kübler-Ross
stages of grieving a loss through death (see Chapter 11 for details on the
stages of grief). You may find yourself easily bouncing between any and all of
the following stages in any order:
 Denial: You’re convinced that this isn’t really the end of the relationship
and that you and your estranged spouse will someday reconcile.
 Anger: You’re totally unable to get beyond your feelings of disappoint-
ment and hurt over the breakup of the relationship.
 Bargaining: You’re ready to offer anything for the opportunity to give
the relationship another go.
 Depression: You’re convinced that you’ll never get over the hurt and
sadness caused by the breakup.
 Acceptance: You see the end of the relationship as the best thing for you
and your erstwhile partner in the long run, and you feel ready to move
on and try to make it on your own.
Perhaps the most significant difference between mourning the loss of a part-
ner through divorce and through death is that, in divorce, you can (and often
have to) still deal with the person after the event. Although you still have to
mourn the loss of the romantic relationship and all you shared on that level,
you retain the possibility of continuing a physical relationship with that person
even if it’s on an entirely different level. When a partner dies, however, the
only way to continue the relationship is on some sort of spiritual level.
Experiencing loss through 
the death of your partner
When you lose your spouse through death, you obviously get no say-so in the
matter. This lack of control and utter helplessness is in strong contrast to the
loss of a spouse through divorce, which, though it may be unavoidable, is
still an act of will rather than a loss of control over one’s destiny.
Lack of control is the salient factor in the profound loss of any loved one. In
the death of a spouse, however, you face the loss of someone you specifically
chose to be with and whom fate saw fit to take from you.
72
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Feelings of anxiety
Besides deep sorrow and regret, you also may feel a great deal of anxiety
related to the new sense of insecurity created by the loss. Often the vulnera-
bility that you feel upon the death of a spouse relates directly to the roles
that your partner played in the relationship, particularly the following:
 Primary breadwinner for your family
 Primary caregiver for you and your children
 Primary decision-maker within your relationship
 Primary catalyst for personal growth and change within your relationship
Because the two of you formed a team, the lack of the other essential
member and the roles that he or she played is sure to be keenly felt. This
absence adds an extra challenge in terms of grieving the loss: Not only must
you grieve the loss of your dearest friend but also you must stretch yourself
in assuming new, untried roles associated with taking care of yourself and the
rest of your immediate family.
You suddenly may be called upon to step into and fill unfamiliar roles that
you’re apprehensive about. This pressure to assume new roles couldn’t come
at a worse time than precisely at the moment you feel most alone and vulner-
able. To help you get through this trying situation, recall the way your part-
ner handled the roles that you must now assume. Keep in mind that you had
a pro after whom you can model your new behaviors.
Health concerns
Another major concern after the death of a spouse is the health and survival
of the remaining partner. Although considered anecdotal, many spouses,
especially seniors, don’t live long after the death of their partners. Some
people refer to this phenomenon as dying of a broken heart, whereas others
consider it the result of giving up in the face of what seems to be the insur-
mountable task of living apart from the person who so long completed the
surviving spouse.
If you’re a caregiver for an elderly surviving partner who’s recently lost his or
her long-time companion, you need to be particularly vigilant about that
person’s physical and mental health. Look for any signs of resignation or
deep depression, and listen for serious talk of not wanting to go on living. If
you notice these conditions, you may want to seek the advice and help of a
professional grief counselor (see Chapter 14). The health and even the con-
tinued existence of this person may depend upon getting help so that he or
she sees that even this terrible grief is survivable.

Chapter 4: The Loss of Partners and Spouses

The Practical and Spiritual 
Aspects of Partner Loss
The loss of a spouse has both practical and spiritual aspects. This section
includes a review of the more common challenges that you may face as you
grieve the loss. Most of the practical challenges fall into one of three major
categories: financial, social, and sensual.
The most significant spiritual challenge that anyone who loses a spouse faces
is how to function on his or her own. After being part and parcel of a team for
such a long time, you may find the notion of living on your own incomprehen-
sible and the very idea of ever falling in love again and building an entirely
new romantic relationship completely absurd.
Managing the financial impact
Given the economic realities of modern life, very few couples can afford to
have only a single breadwinner. Therefore, in many households, both part-
ners must work in order to make ends meet and ensure the economic health
of the family.
The loss of income previously provided by the deceased partner can put an
extra strain on the bereaved surviving partner. Even if your late spouse didn’t
work outside the home but instead provided primary care for your children,
the loss has a financial impact if you must resort to day care or some other
paid childcare in order to continue working outside the home.
Financial challenges are compounded if you weren’t the one usually in charge
of tracking and managing household finances. It’s not all that unusual to find
a surviving partner who rarely, if ever, paid the monthly bills or juggled the
household finances. For such a person, assuming sole responsibility for
finances is an extra burden in grieving the loss, not to mention a real test of
his or her mettle.
For some people, taking over control of the household finances, while quite
challenging (especially when the person’s concentration and mental sharp-
ness suffer from the stress of the grief), provides a much needed escape from
grieving. For others, this new responsibility proves to be too much, at least
during the initial phase of grieving. If you find yourself overwhelmed by finan-
cial tasks, turn to other family members or close friends to help by organizing
the financial records, assessing the financial health of the household, and
74
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

even getting the bills ready to pay. Many times, the boost from this initial
financial help is all that you need in order to take on your new financial role.
The financial impact of the death of a spouse is greatly complicated when, at
the time of death, the partners weren’t legally married or protected by some
kind of state-certified domestic partnership or other legal agreement such as
a living trust. People who live together as partners and who share finances in
a relationship that isn’t legally sanctioned or protected in some way need to
understand that they put the surviving partner at great financial risk in the
event of one of their deaths. Under this sad state of affairs, combined assets
such as joint checking and savings accounts become immediately frozen and
therefore completely unavailable to the surviving partner. This turn of events
can have disastrous effects if the money is needed in order to pay monthly bills
and provide for the family’s other daily necessities (as it almost always is).
To minimize these types of financial hardships, couples must do some estate
planning before anything happens to either one of them. At a bare minimum,
married couples should have individual wills that dictate how any assets not
held in common are to be apportioned. Couples who aren’t legally married
need to have a revocable living trust in place that indicates the beneficiaries
of all shared assets. Note that even married couples can benefit from setting
up a living trust because it enables the surviving spouse to settle financial
affairs without the additional expense and complication of Probate Court. For
more ideas on how to protect your partner financially, see Estate Planning For
Dummies by N. Brian Caverly and Jordan S. Simon (Wiley). For help on creat-
ing a will or living trust, visit the Legal Documentation Service Web site at
www.legalzoom.com or visit the Estate Plan Center Web site at www.avoid
estatetaxes.com.
Disenfranchised partner grief
Partner grief is made much more difficult in cases where members of either
or both families refuse to accept the relationship and recognize it as legiti-
mate. The lack of acceptance can range from a steadfast refusal to acknowl-
edge your partner and the true nature of his or her relationship to you all the
way to a total repudiation of your partner and condemnation of the relation-
ship you share.
When this lack of acceptance comes from your partner’s immediate family
and is combined with a lack of the legal protection afforded by marriage or
some sort of state-sanctioned domestic partnership, you may experience ter-
rible problems upon the loss of your partner. Under these circumstances,
these rather unwelcoming next of kin are the only ones with the legal right to
make decisions about your partner’s medical care and funeral arrangements.
75
Chapter 4: The Loss of Partners and Spouses

Also, in the absence of a will, these people are the only ones whom the courts
recognize as having an interest in your partner’s finances and remaining
material goods. In short, you may be left with nothing and not be allowed to
make any decisions concerning your deceased partner.
To avoid this kind of disastrous situation from ever becoming a reality (even
when you’re both on good terms with each other’s immediate families), you
and your partner need to have each of the following things in place:
 Wills that clearly indicate each of your wishes upon your deaths
 Power of attorney for each other that gives you and your partner con-
trol over the other’s finances when either one of you is incapacitated
 Medical power of attorney for each other that gives you each the 
power to make critical medical decisions when either one of you is 
incapacitated
 Living trust that determines the apportioning of your partner’s estate
and keeps you out of Probate Court
For help with any of these kinds of legal forms, visit the Legal Documentation
Service Web site at www.legalzoom.com.
Even when control of your partner’s estate isn’t an issue, not having your
own family’s acceptance of your relationship often makes grieving your part-
ner’s passing much more arduous. Many times, disapproving family members
may not actively support you in grieving the loss and even may go so far as
to discourage you from expressing any of your feelings of grief around them.
Without this support, you can feel even more isolated and depressed about
the loss than you normally would. When you don’t have your family’s sup-
port, you need to seek out people (friends or a grief counselor or support
group; see Chapter 14) who can honor your relationship and who recognize
the seriousness of your loss.
Dealing with the social solitude
As the old Three Dog Night song says, “One is the loneliest number that you’ll
ever do.” This message really rings true when it comes to dealing with the
social aspects of losing a partner. Suddenly, you find yourself to be a party of
one rather than part of a couple; so many of the social situations in which
you were completely comfortable before you now find to be quite awkward.
Many people who are part of a couple rarely interact socially as individuals
except with a select group of friends. When they’re widowed, they then
76
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

become the proverbial third wheel in these social situations. This feeling of
being out of place not only discourages future social interaction with other
couples but also tends to act as a vivid reminder of the bereaved partner’s
new alone status.
For many surviving spouses, undertaking any activity that they almost
always would have done as a couple is difficult to contemplate, let alone
undertake. Nothing brings home the sense of social solitude associated with
the loss of a partner like the first time you do an activity alone that you nor-
mally did as a couple, such as go to a restaurant for dinner or take in a movie.
This solo experience either reinforces the loneliness that you’re feeling or
marks a new stage in the grieving process in which you get ready to find and
define a new individual identity outside of the old relationship.
Coping with the sensual isolation
Intimacy, both physical and emotional, is the watchword of a romantic part-
nership. In losing your partner, you’re immediately and permanently bereft of
the comfort and well-being that both types of intimacy bring you.
Touch is a fundamental and vital part of the romantic relationship. With the
loss of your spouse, not only do you suffer from loss of being able to touch
your partner but you suffer from no longer being touched by him or her.
Longing for the touch of your beloved is only one part of the story; you also
suffer from not being able to express your affection. For some bereaved
widows and widowers, this shutdown of physical closeness and touch leads
to an emotional shutdown that naturally creates more distance between
them and their friends and family. The distance reinforces the sense of isola-
tion that’s already an inescapable part of this type of grief and, in the end,
makes grieving the loss of their spouses even more difficult.
When you’re feeling deprived of touch, there’s not a lot you can do on your
own to mitigate the situation. The best thing you can do is to seek out touch
from other family members and from those friends with whom you’re com-
fortable being physical on this level.
When you’re supporting someone who’s grieving the loss of a partner, the
best thing you can is to make sure that you touch him repeatedly during each
visit, not just when you first greet him and finally take your leave (assuming,
of course, that you check with him beforehand to make sure that this touch-
ing is welcome). Perhaps put your arm around him or hold his hand at times
as you converse — whatever’s appropriate to your particular relationship
with the person. Although it’s no substitute for what he’s lost, your touch can
77
Chapter 4: The Loss of Partners and Spouses

go a long way in helping the person through sensual deprivation and help
keep him connected on both the physical and emotional levels.
Learning how to be on your own
Even more difficult than the practical challenges that you face after losing a
spouse is the spiritual challenge of learning to live once again as an individual —
what you might call “making it on your own.”
After losing my own partner of nearly 20 years, I maintain that one spouse
does not outlive the other. By that I mean that such a large part of each
person’s identity is invested in the couple of which they are a part that, when
the couple ceases to be, not only is the deceased partner lost, but a large
part of the surviving partner’s sense of self is lost as well.
As a result, the surviving partner faces the ultimate challenge of redefining
himself as an individual whose identity doesn’t depend upon his better half.
This challenge is daunting for all but the best of us and often complicates and
extends the grieving process.
Part of what can complicate this task is the mistaken notion that, in becom-
ing someone who can live on your own, you debase the memory of the part-
ner you’re grieving by somehow discrediting the relationship that you shared
together. Many times people hold onto their old identities for fear that it’s the
only way to keep alive the memories of what they shared with their partners.
Another part of the challenge of redefining yourself stems from simply not
knowing how to act and be an independent person after being an integral
part of a couple. Remember that it takes time to find your own way and
rebuild your self-assurance. Sometimes, assuming the roles that your partner
used to fulfill in the relationship is the first step in becoming your own
person. In seeing yourself successfully take over and manage the tasks
required by these new roles, you gain a new confidence in yourself that can
help you see where you want to go and ultimately who you want to be.
Successfully becoming your own person again sometimes runs a parallel
course to your stages of grieving the loss (see Chapter 11). As you’re able to
express more of your grief and accept the loss, you may find that you’re
increasingly ready to make decisions about your own future. In turn, you’re
able to take on new responsibilities that help to identify the new, indepen-
dent person you’ll be when you finally integrate this loss into the rest of 
your life.
78
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Keeping Your Love Alive
After the loss of your spouse, it’s quite natural to feel as though you’ll never
find love again and be a part of another long-term romantic relationship.
Moreover, you may even feel as though you never again want to invest your-
self in such an arrangement.
After all, you now know firsthand just how tremendously tough it is to sur-
vive the loss of a beloved partner. And although you know it’s possible to get
through terrible grief and come out on the other side, the memory of the pain
involved in the process is so deep and real that you really can’t conceive of
ever making yourself vulnerable to that kind of suffering again.
In time, as your grieving comes to an end, you’ll start recalling more and
more of the sweetness of what you shared with your partner. As part of incor-
porating the loss into the rest of your life, you’ll remember the good in the
relationship, and the stark memory of the pain of the grieving will begin to
soften. As part of defining yourself as a new, independent person, you may
begrudge the loneliness and long again for something akin to the warmth and
security you knew in the relationship you shared with your deceased love.
Remaining true to your lost partner
The first hurdle you face in even contemplating falling in love again is figuring
out how to love again while remaining true to the memory of your lost part-
ner. The essential challenge is how to keep the love you had with your
deceased partner alive while leaving yourself open to the possibility of
another relationship.
At first, it can’t help but feel like a huge betrayal to consider loving anyone
else but your deceased spouse. By the way, this feeling of infidelity usually
isn’t mitigated much by any discussions you may have had with your spouse
before his death about remarriage (you know, the old “If anything ever hap-
pens to me, promise me that you’ll marry again” argument). Although it may
be somewhat reassuring to know that your deceased spouse didn’t want you
to remain forever celibate, this knowledge still won’t guide you in deciding
how to be true to his memory and still find love again.
In my humble opinion, you can’t move on without first figuring out a way to
be confident that falling in love again and building a new relationship with
someone else will not threaten your memory of your deceased spouse. To
accomplish this, I recommend that you incorporate his memory into your
new life. One very effective way to do this is by thoroughly reviewing all the
79
Chapter 4: The Loss of Partners and Spouses

positive qualities that your partner brought into your life and finding ways to
emulate those qualities and make them a part of you and your new relation-
ship (see Chapter 18 for more on this subject).
Finding love again
No matter how many years intervene, finding love again after grieving the
loss of a deceased partner isn’t as easy as it may first sound. Assuming that
you’ve dealt successfully with the problem of how to keep the love from 
your earlier relationship alive and even bring it into a new relationship, you
still have the challenge of rebuilding your trust in these kinds of romantic
relationships.
Gathering the courage to commit
After the hard work of grieving a long-time partner, it’s not all that easy to
reestablish your trust in romantic relationships. After all, you now know
beyond a shadow of a doubt that investing yourself in such a relationship is
risky. There’s no guarantee that you won’t ever have to face such grief again,
and even more important, you understand that none can be given. True love
is no longer a defense against death, and hard grief is the price that love
exacts.
The only way around this predicament is to have faith in the new person
you’ve become. You know how much you hurt when you grieved your part-
ner’s death, but you also know that you survived it — and came through it
with the desire to give another go. That’s not only a tribute to the strength of
the love you had with your deceased partner but also a testament to your
resiliency.
Avoiding comparisons
The other potential snag in building a new romance can come from compar-
ing the relationship you build with your new partner to the relationship you
had with your deceased partner. It’s all too easy to romanticize your old rela-
tionship and canonize your deceased spouse. From this rather skewed per-
spective, your new romance, not to mention your new partner, doesn’t stand
a chance when things aren’t going exactly as you expected or wanted.
The best way to avoid counterproductive comparisons is to remind yourself
that each person is totally exceptional and irreplaceable. Take to heart that
your deceased partner was one of a kind, as are you. Together you built a
matchless relationship. You carry part of this unique character into the new
relationship but can expect only to create something new and nonrepeatable.
80
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Keeping in mind that you’re no longer the same person you were and your
new love is without comparison can go a long way toward keeping you open
and preventing you from wallowing in comparisons between your old love
and your old relationship.

The Loss of Siblings
In This Chapter
 Mapping out the dynamics of sibling relationships
 Grieving the death of a sibling as a child and as an adult
 Dealing with the death of a twin
 Helping surviving siblings process their grief
 Exploring resources on healing the loss of a brother or sister
S
ibling loss is marked by the loss of a brother or sister and the grieving
that the surviving siblings undergo as a result. Some grief professionals
refer to the grief from this type of loss as disenfranchised grief, by which they
mean that the grief of the surviving siblings is commonly overlooked or
undervalued by society at large and sometimes even by the other family
members suffering the loss. At the opposite end of the spectrum from surviv-
ing siblings experiencing disenfranchised grief are bereaved siblings who fail
to appreciate the magnitude of their grief, especially if they lost their broth-
ers or sisters when they were young children.
In an attempt to validate this kind of loss, the chapter begins by evaluating
the types of relationships that brothers and sisters establish, including a look
at sibling rivalry as well as the incredible closeness that brothers and sisters
can establish.
From there, the chapter moves on to examine the impact of losing a sibling —
either when you’re a child or when you’re an adult. I also explore the special
phenomenon of losing a twin brother or sister. This chapter concludes with
suggestions on how parents and surviving siblings can help each through
their grief. I also provide you with lists of both print and online resources
that you can use to help deal with and heal sibling grief.
The Pain and Pleasure of Siblings
Anyone who isn’t an only child knows both the pain and pleasure that come
with growing up with brothers and sisters. Having siblings to contend with

for your parents’ affection and time and to compete with over everything
from food, clothes, and toys to the family car can be both extremely frustrat-
ing and extremely exhilarating.
The three salient factors operating in the dynamics of sibling relationships are:
 Birth order: Often determines which sibling leads and assumes a more
parental role in regard to the other kids and which sibling follows
 Sibling rivalry: The degree of rivalry that exists in the family as broth-
ers and sisters compete with each other for parental affection and family
resources
 Sibling solidarity: The degree of closeness that grows and exists
between particular pairs of siblings, especially twins
The following sections examine each of these three factors in more detail
before taking a look at the impact that they can have in dealing with loss of a
brother or sister and healing the grief that ensues.
Sibling birth order
Strangely enough, even among siblings who are twins and therefore by defini-
tion share the same birthday, birth order is very important; it’s often a bone
of contention for the younger sibling and acts as some sort of badge of honor
for the older sibling. More often than not, people refer to their brothers not
just as “my brother” but as “my older brother” or “my kid brother” and sis-
ters not as “my sister” but as “my older sister” or “my kid sister.”
The rank that traditionally follows the birth order is often a key factor in the
roles that brothers and sisters play in each other’s lives and the type of bond-
ing that goes on between them. Many child psychologists and behaviorists
associate the following roles with the three major ranks in sibling birth order:
 Firstborn: The eldest child who once had the experience of being an
only child and then had to share the limelight with other siblings.
Firstborn children are said to be more competitive, more independent,
and sometimes more intelligent.
 Middle child: The child who has never had the parents’ undivided atten-
tion and therefore has never known the limelight of being an only child.
They’re said to be more even-tempered, more pioneering, and some-
times perfectionists.
 Lastborn: The child who’s the baby of the family and is often the most
spoiled and pampered. Youngest children are said to be more outgoing,
more charming, and sometimes more manipulative.
86
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Naturally, these characterizations of the firstborn, middle, and lastborn chil-
dren in a family are probably just as often wide of the mark as they are spot
on. About the only generalization I think is justifiable is that siblings remain
very aware of their birth order and jockey for family resources using every
advantage that their rank in the family affords them.
Sibling rivalry
Undoubtedly the most famous aspect of having brothers and sisters is the
almost incessant and ongoing competitiveness known as sibling rivalry.
Although some sibling rivalry involves real aggression, sibling rivalry is not
to be confused with sibling abuse, in which one sibling victimizes another.
Most sibling rivalry revolves around competing for the parents’ attention
(which becomes more and more limited the more siblings there are) and
sometimes other limited physical family resources such as food, clothes, and
toys that must distributed and shared.
Studies have shown that brother pairs within the immediate family are the
most rivalrous siblings, with sets of male twins being the most competitive of
all. Pairs of sisters within the immediate family, however, tend to be the least
rivalrous and the most bonded.
Provided that the competitiveness isn’t encouraged by the parents, sibling
rivalry tends to diminish over time so that most adult siblings outgrow it.
Sometimes, however, it lives on into adulthood and is fueled by resentments
over real or imagined wrongs that occurred when the siblings were growing up.
Oddly enough, although sibling rivalry can drive a wedge between particular
pairs of brothers and sisters, this competitiveness just as well can strengthen
the bonds between adult siblings. The lasting effects of sibling rivalry depend
upon many factors, including the spread in years between the particular pair
of siblings (the more years in between, the less likely it is that the rivalry will
have a healing effect in adulthood).
Sibling solidarity
Just as rivalry may exist between siblings in a family, close bonds may exist
between pairs of siblings. Sometimes, these bonds are forged in childhood
and remain strong (despite the occurrence of intermittent tiffs and spats)
throughout the siblings’ lives. For example, my mother and her only sister
bonded in this way when they were girls and remained physically and emo-
tionally close to each other their entire lives.
87
Chapter 5: The Loss of Siblings

Solidarity between siblings usually involves pairs of sisters or, to a somewhat
lesser extent, pairs of brothers in the immediate family. It also can involve a
mixed pair of a brother and sister, although this scenario usually happens
when they’re the only two children or they’re bonded together by some
extraordinary circumstances such as a family tragedy or illness.
The factors that make for this kind of special bonding between pairs of sib-
lings are diverse. The most important are probably
 Age difference
 How well the natural personalities of the two siblings mesh
 Shared family experiences
Most really close pairs of brothers and sisters are usually close in age, with
not more than a difference of five years between them. Although their person-
alities can differ (for example, one sibling may be a really gregarious person
and the other more reserved), they normally need either to complement one
another or meld well together. The big exception to this rule is identical
twins: They may have personalities that aren’t normally complementary, but
the twins still may be very close for a number of other reasons both genetic
and experiential.
Shared experiences also may create strong, enduring bonds between a pair of
siblings. These mutual experiences can run the gamut from those that arise
from shared interests to those that involve one sibling protecting or acting as
a parent toward the other. Whatever their nature, reciprocated experiences
serve to create rich memories and deep feelings of loyalty that help to cement
the bond between the pair of siblings, a bond that often lasts their entire lives.
Exploring the Impact of Losing a Sibling
The relationships between brothers and sisters can be intricate and multifac-
eted. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the grief that comes from
their deaths is complex. Factors such as the birth order of the deceased sib-
ling, the degree of sibling rivalry that existed and its residual effects, and the
degree of closeness with the deceased sibling all come into play.
In addition, as with the deaths of other loved ones, the time in your life when
you suffer your loss contributes significantly to its impact on your life. It mat-
ters a great deal whether you’re a child still living under your parents’ roof
when one of your siblings dies or you’re an adult living on your own and, per-
haps, raising your own family.
88
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

When you lose a sibling as a child, you’re left to wonder what it would have
been like to grow up with your lost brother or sister as well as what type of
person he or she would have grown up to be. When you lose a sibling as an
adult, you’re left with vivid memories of your childhood together as well as
with a sense of regret that you’re unable to continue that relationship in
adulthood.
Experiencing the death 
of a sibling as a child
As I point out in Chapter 7 on children and grief, children grieve differently
from adults, and how they understand death and are able express their grief
depends directly upon their development (which most often is a function of
their ages).
Special challenges
When you lose a sibling as a child, you’re confronted with all the same chal-
lenges of comprehending the meaning of the loss and expressing your grief as
you are with any other kind of loss, such as that of a grandparent, parent, or
other close relative or friend. In addition, however, the loss of a sibling in the
immediate family often brings with it the following special challenges to a
surviving sibling:
 Concern that someone else in the immediate family will now die, either
one of the parents or, many times, the grieving sibling
 Guilt over the death, especially if the deceased sibling had been ill for
some time and the surviving sibling was particularly jealous of all the
attention he received before death
 Resentfulness toward the deceased sibling and/or the parents if the sur-
viving sibling thinks (almost always mistakenly) that the parents would
have preferred him to die rather than the deceased brother or sister.
This idea often comes from hearing the parents say something like “Why
did dear little Suzy have to die?”; the child incorrectly interprets this to
mean “Why didn’t one of you other bad kids die instead?”
Special challenges such as these may require you as a parent to give more
reassurance than normal to the surviving siblings. See “Helping the Surviving
Siblings Grieve,” later in this chapter, for details on how to give this kind of
reassurance and support.
The types of sibling survivors
In her excellent book on sibling grief (see “Resources for Healing the Loss of 
a Sibling,” later in this chapter), P. Gill White identifies the following seven
89
Chapter 5: The Loss of Siblings

types of sibling survivors based on research done on families with children
grieving the loss of siblings:
1. Haunted child: This is the surviving sibling who lives in a family that
doesn’t talk about the death of his brother or sister. He has no real
opportunity to grieve the loss as a child (a true disenfranchised griever),
so the grief may resurface during some crisis, trauma, or other death he
experiences as an adult.
2. Overprotected child: This is the surviving sibling whose parents
become overprotective as a result of the death of his brother or sister in
the hope that they never have to suffer such a terrible loss again. In so
doing, the parents can interfere with the child’s sense of self-reliance
and independence.
3. Lap child: This is the child whose brother or sister suffers from a long
illness before death and whose mother curtails the child’s activities and
keeps him close in order to make it easier to tend to the ill sibling. This
kind of treatment sometimes fosters a sense of passiveness and help-
lessness in the surviving sibling.
4. Replacement child: This type of child may be the result of two different
circumstances: He’s born or adopted after the death of a brother or
sister and then is treated as a replacement for the deceased sibling; or
he tries to act like his deceased brother or sister and therefore become
the deceased sibling’s replacement in the family.
5. Lonely child: This surviving sibling either is neglected during the dying
and grieving of a deceased sibling or is the last surviving child and
therefore grows up as an only child.
6. Later-born child: This is a child who’s born into the family sometime
after the death of a brother or sister. He can feel a variety of emotions
regarding the deceased sibling.
• He may feel resentful of other surviving siblings who had an oppor-
tunity to know the deceased brother or sister.
• He may see the deceased sibling he never knew as some type of
guide or guardian angel.
• He may resent the deceased sibling for dying and therefore making
his parents sad.
7. Scapegoat child: This is the surviving sibling who bears the brunt of the
parents’ unhappiness and hostility brought on by guilt and regret after
the death of his brother or sister.
As you may imagine, each type of child in this list has his own special burden
to carry when attempting to grieve the death of a sibling. For many types, the
actual grieving of the deceased sibling can’t take place until he’s on his own
as an adult. In many cases, the experience of another profound loss in the
surviving sibling’s life triggers his grieving for the lost brother or sister.
90
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Experiencing the death of 
a sibling as an adult
Losing your brother or sister as an adult is hard enough. The experience is
made more difficult when the preponderance of other people’s condolences
and sympathy for the loss goes to the surviving parents, spouse, and chil-
dren of the deceased, bypassing you and any other surviving siblings (see
the sidebar “Adult sibling loss as the epitome of disenfranchised grief” for
more on disenfranchised grief).
How much the loss of your deceased sibling affects you depends in large part
upon how close you were to your brother or sister prior to his or her death.
It also depends upon how close you were during your childhood and the
amount and quality of experiences you shared.
Regardless of how intimate or distant your relations were as adults, the loss
of a sibling is bound to bring up all sorts of memories of shared childhood
experiences. The death may also stir up memories of conflicts and sibling
rivalry, perhaps even particular incidents for which you feel particularly
responsible and somewhat regretful.
If you harbor some childhood resentments against your deceased brother or
sister, you may relive the conflicts and incidents that gave rise to these feel-
ings, and your memories may rekindle anger against your deceased sibling.
It’s very important that you deal with any guilt and anger that you feel toward
your deceased brother or sister so that you can then get on with the work of
healing from the loss of your sibling. Find appropriate ways to express your
feelings both physically and creatively, as well as through ritual and memorial.
As well, find ways to forgive yourself (in the case of guilt) and your deceased
sibling (in the case of anger). Granting forgiveness clears the way for feeling
the sorrow associated with loss and incorporating the loss into the rest of your
life. See Chapter 2 for ideas on how to deal with guilt and blame. Check out
Chapter 14 for suggestions on ways to express the feelings that arise when you
lose a loved one and Chapter 15 for ways to memorialize your relationship.
Experiencing the death of a twin
Twins form a unique family unit: They’re the two siblings in the immediate
family who grow and develop together, keeping pace with one another as well
as competing voraciously for parental attention and family resources.
91
Chapter 5: The Loss of Siblings

Twins, especially identical twins, form a kind of symbiotic union that repre-
sents something larger than just two people who happen to be siblings of 
the same age. When one twin dies, the surviving twin doesn’t simply lose a
brother or sister but also a part of his or her very own identity.
As you may expect, some twins are so competitive with one another that,
when one dies, the other actually may feel relieved on some level that he no
longer has to strive so hard for his parents’ attention. He may have initial
feelings of being released from the struggle to be an individual in the eyes of
family and friends.
However, the surviving twin’s feelings of relief and release are usually short-
lived and often are accompanied by huge regret over having to live without
the one person who understood him as no one else could and the one who
completed him in so many ways.
Consequently, it’s completely understandable that a surviving twin, regard-
less of how young or old he is when he loses his other half, can have great
difficulty grieving his loss. Healing this kind of sibling grief may take a great
deal longer than healing nontwin sibling losses. In fact, I think the death of a
twin is more akin to losing a spouse or life partner whom you considered to
be your soul mate. This is a case where you may need to seek out profes-
sional help in getting through the loss (see Chapter 14 for suggestions on
locating a professional grief counselor).
92
Part I: Contemplating Grief 
Adult sibling loss as the epitome 
of disenfranchised grief
Ken Doka, a renowned grief researcher, coined
the term disenfranchised grief in 1963 to
describe the experience of surviving divorced
spouses who, in grieving the loss of their former
life partners, weren’t treated as legitimate
mourners because they were no longer married.
Since then, grief professionals have widened the
scope of this term to include a number of other
types of mourners (such as grandparents, gay
and lesbian life partners, and friends, the sub-
ject of Chapter 8). Recently, as grief research
finally has started taking a long, hard look at sib-
ling grief, disenfranchised grief has broadened
to apply to surviving siblings, especially adult
siblings.
As an example of how society devalues and
fails to recognize the grief of adult siblings, T.J.
Wray (author of Surviving the Death of a Sibling;
see the section “Books,” later in this chapter,
for details), refers to the frequency of what she
calls dismissive condolences that surviving
adult siblings routinely receive after they tell
friends and colleagues of the loss of their broth-
ers or sisters. These trivializing condolences
include such responses as “How awful — your
parents must be heartbroken!” “Thank good-
ness it wasn’t your wife (husband) or one of
your children!” and “Well, you lived so far apart
and saw each so infrequently, you must not
have been that close.”

Helping the Surviving Siblings Grieve
There are two potential sources of help in grieving the loss of a sibling: the
parents who lost a child in this death and the other surviving brothers and
sisters who lost a sibling. If the death occurs when the surviving siblings are
children, then they must look more to their parents than to each other for
guidance and help in grieving the loss.
Leaning on parents
For the most part, parents can help a child grieve the loss of a sibling in the
same way that they help the child grieve the loss of any other loved one (see
Chapter 7 for specific suggestions). However, because some specific fears
and doubts are attached to this type of loss, there are a couple of additional
things you may need to do to support a child grieving a sibling’s death:
 Explain to your child that in no way is he responsible for the death of his
brother or sister. Children often feel that they caused the death either by
wishing at some point that the sibling were gone or by doing something
bad that somehow caused the death.
 Comfort your child both emotionally and physically, and assure him
again and again of your love even in this terrible time of sorrow. Make
sure that he doesn’t get any hint that you would have wished him to die
rather than his sibling.
 Reassure your child that his sibling’s death doesn’t mean that you’ll die
or that he’s in danger of dying. Children often fear that the death of a
sibling will be followed by the death of themselves or one or both of
their parents.
Getting comfort from other siblings
If you experience the death of a sibling when you and any other surviving sib-
lings are adults, then you’re likely to look primarily to one another for help
and guidance in your grieving. Surviving parents are often too frail and devas-
tated by the loss of their adult child to be of much help.
Although they may be suffering a great deal of grief, surviving siblings are
usually a good source of mutual comfort. They often understand the depth of
the grief caused by this particular loss and relate to childhood memories
involving the deceased sibling, all while still being able to communicate and
share their feelings regarding the personal significance of the loss of their
brother or sister.
93
Chapter 5: The Loss of Siblings

Resources for Healing 
the Loss of a Sibling
Print and online resources to help you heal the loss of a sibling are readily
available and of very good quality (although they aren’t nearly as numerous
as those for parents grieving the loss of children or resources that cover chil-
dren’s grief).
The print resources that I recommend include those targeted to adults sur-
viving the loss of a sibling as well as those addressed to surviving siblings of
any age. Some of the books offer very concise how-to guidance, whereas
others contain moving and personal recollections of what it was like to
mourn the loss of a brother or sister.
The online resources recommended here range from Web sites containing
solid information on the idiosyncrasies of grieving a sibling as well as online
communities where you can share your grief with others suffering the same
type of loss. Of particular interest is an online support group for surviving
twins who have lost twin brothers or sisters.
Books
For a while, sibling grief was a much overlooked area of grieving; however, 
in recent years, good solid books from grief professionals have started to
appear in some number. Great books recounting the personal sagas of the
death and mourning of siblings have been around for some time.
My recommended book list mostly includes books by professionals describ-
ing the phenomenon of sibling grief. (However, all the authors without excep-
tion have suffered the personal loss of a brother or sister as well.) The
exception in the list is the very personal and moving Letters to Sara: The
Agony of Adult Sibling Loss by Anne McCurry.
Here are my recommendations for some of the great books on healing the
loss of a sibling:
 Sibling Grief: Healing after the Death of a Sister or Brother by P. Gill
White (iUniverse): At the age of 15, P. Gill White lost her younger sister
and later became the founder and director of the not-for-profit organiza-
tion The Sibling Connection. This book contains valuable and insightful
information about grieving the death of a sibling during childhood, ado-
lescence, and adulthood. This slender volume also contains practical
suggestions for healing loss through creativity, memorials, and dreams.
The book concludes with ideas on how to use further reading about sib-
ling loss to help heal the grief (what White calls bibliotherapy) followed
94
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

by a book list that’s worth the entire price of the book. The list is orga-
nized into age-appropriate categories, fiction and nonfiction, and memoirs.
 Surviving the Death of a Sibling: Living Through Grief When an
Adult Brother or Sister Dies by T.J. Wray (Three Rivers Press): T.J.
Wray suffered the loss of her only sibling, her adult brother, and eventu-
ally founded an online community for surviving adult siblings (see the
next section for Web site details). Her book uses the structure of the
Kübler-Ross Five Stages of Grief (see Chapter 11) and quotes from many
case histories to illustrate the impact of losing an adult brother or sister.
This book also explores the spiritual and religious ramifications of sib-
ling loss and ends with practical suggestions of activities that you may
undertake to mitigate the grief and aid the grieving process.
 Recovering from the Loss of a Sibling by Katherine Fair Donnelly
(toExcel): In this book, Donnelly, a surviving sibling, compiled stories of
other surviving siblings of all ages. These personal narratives are arranged
thematically and cover such topics as denial, anger, coping with holi-
days and anniversaries, families that suffer multiple losses, and prob-
lems that grieving children typically encounter at school and grieving
adults at work.
 Letters to Sara: The Agony of Adult Sibling Loss by Anne McCurry
(Authorhouse): Anne McCurry lost her only big sister, Sara, after her
long struggle with breast cancer. This book consists of a series of deeply
personal letters written to Sara that chronicle Anne’s tremendous grief
over her death. This book is not only a great resource on sibling grieving
but also a living example of how journaling all the feelings associated
with the loss can help transform the grief.
 The Empty Room: Surviving the Loss of a Brother or Sister at Any
Age by Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn (Scribner): At age 14, the author lost
her only sibling, her older brother Ted, after an eight-year illness. DeVita-
Raeburn very skillfully weaves this personal story into the larger fabric
of losing a brother or sister and its often devastating effects on the sur-
viving siblings. Of particular interest are the author’s coverage of sibling
grief as disenfranchised grief, the importance of claiming and telling the
story of your sibling’s death, reconstituting yourself in light of the loss
(a process that she calls re-forming your identity), and “carrying” your
lost sibling forward into your present-day life.
Online resources
The online resources for help in healing the grief of losing a sibling include a
great many sites where you can share your feelings and communicate with
others suffering the same type of loss. In addition, you’ll find sites that are
full of good insights into the particular problems you may face.

The Loss of Children
In This Chapter
 Examining the pain associated with the loss of a child
 Exploring the impact of losing a child at any age
 Understanding how child loss affects the family
 Turning to additional resources for help
T
he loss of a child is possibly the most difficult loss to endure and surely
among the most difficult to integrate into one’s life. The death of a child is
unlike any other loss because children are an enormous part of your legacy,
and in their deaths, a large part of your own future dies. This makes the task
of incorporating and integrating the loss of a child a lifelong endeavor, and it
means that, for many parents, the grieving doesn’t end even after they’ve
learned to live with the loss.
This chapter looks at the loss of a child from many perspectives. It begins by
examining the general nature of this singular type of loss in terms of the ques-
tioning, second-guessing, and guilt that often accompany it. The chapter then
investigates the effects of losing a child under different circumstances (abor-
tion, miscarriage, and so on) and at different ages (from infant to adult). It
ends by examining the effects that losing a child can have on the family struc-
ture before covering a variety of resources you can turn to for more informa-
tion and guidance in dealing with this particular kind of grieving.
The Cruelest Loss of All
In the natural order of things, children are expected to outlive their parents.
When parents end up outliving their children, this natural order is turned
topsy-turvy. Therefore, it’s not surprising that parents who face this grim
reality routinely question the justice of the cosmos as part of their grieving
process. This kind of questioning is spurred on by the fact that children are

synonymous with innocence; as such, there seems to be no way to defend
their deaths as justified.
Parents suffering this type of loss often not only question the type of world
order that can allow this kind of calamity to occur but also undergo a total
crisis of faith that may result in a repudiation of both their religious tradi-
tions and communities. This crisis of faith is sometimes initiated through the
use of pious clichés by well-meaning clergy, family members, and friends.
“God never gives you anything that you can’t handle” or a variation thereof
ranks as one of the more common and particularly cruel clichés. (See
Chapter 20 for a bunch more of these beauties and the reasons they’re so
destructive.) This one’s so cruel because there’s no comfort in being strong
and being without your child; worse yet, it gives the parents the impression
that if they weren’t so strong, then maybe God would have spared them this
tragedy. And by this twisted logic, grieving parents can take away the worth-
less idea that they’re somehow responsible for their child’s death.
Any attribution, however subtle, that the parents are in some way respon-
sible for their child’s death is particularly perilous because, more often than
not, the parents are already second-guessing the circumstances and feeling
some sense of guilt over the death. This is true even if the parents are in no
way responsible for the death and only did everything within their power to
keep their child safe, secure, and healthy.
Guilt and the death of a child
When someone close to you dies, you’re very likely to feel some sense of
responsibility even if you clearly bear none. You can hear it in “If only I’d
done this . . .” or “If only I hadn’t done that . . .” thoughts or statements that
you make. This tinge of guilt is so common, in fact, that it feels like a part of
the usual grieving process, like the similarly logic-defying stage of denial (see
Chapter 11). This being said, feeling guilty is all the more common with par-
ents who’ve lost a child, especially a young child.
This guilt in the loss of a child probably stems in no small part from the
understanding that parents’ primary responsibilities are to nurture and pro-
tect their children from harm and the subsequent feeling on the parents’ part
that, when their child dies, they’ve failed in these duties. Another reason may
be that, because the parents can find no ready-made cosmic justification for
the untimely death of their innocent child, their minds naturally explore ways
in which they may have contributed to the tragedy inadvertently.
98
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Feelings of guilt and recrimination over the death that you hold onto can
overshadow and eventually overpower the grieving process. If you find your-
self caught up in “if only” statements, reliving the facts of the death in order
to figure out what you could or should have done differently, and, worse yet,
beating yourself up over what you did or didn’t do, you need to deal with 
the guilt.
One of the most effective ways to deal with guilt (even though it may be mis-
placed) is through forgiveness. Chapter 10 has suggestions on ways to work
on forgiving yourself, God, the universe, the doctor, the medical system, your
clergyman, and whoever else needs pardoning in your particular situation.
Coming to terms with the loss in 
moral and philosophical terms
Whatever the reasons, a parent’s need to justify the loss of a child and the
unbearable grief is exceptionally strong. The need can manifest itself not only
in undue guilt on the parent’s part but also in fierce anger with the cosmic
order that enabled this disaster to occur. Very often, anger takes the form of
a quarrel with God (even if the parent wasn’t overly religious or worried
about the moral state of the universe prior to the child’s death) in the form of
some variation on the theme of “How could God allow this kind of thing to
happen?” or “How could He have created a world in which innocent beings
suffer and die before their time?”
Of course, these questions are just variants of the essential question “Why 
do bad things happen to good people?” that I discuss briefly in Chapter 1 (in
the Western guise of the biblical book of Job and in the Eastern guise of the
theory of karma). Because the untimely death of a young child who’s clearly
innocent represents the quintessential example of bad things happening to
good people and because so many parents wrangle with this question as part
of their grieving a child’s death, I revisit this question in this section.
In his wonderful book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People (Anchor),
Rabbi Harold Kushner takes up the question “Why do bad things happen to
good people?” both in terms of the book of Job and in light of the suffering
and death of his own son at age 13 due to illness. In his book, Kushner comes
to the rather astonishing conclusion that God must not be all powerful. The
rabbi refuses to believe in a God who is not all good, so in his estimation, God
can’t be both all powerful and all good and still allow the suffering of innocents.
99
Chapter 6: The Loss of Children

I think that more important than the rabbi’s rather unorthodox interpretation
of the book of Job is his reminder that an answer to a question doesn’t have
to be a reason. Rather, it can be a response. Here’s what I mean:
 There’s clearly no answer to why a child should suffer and die in the
sense of a reason because there’s no moral justification for it.
 There is, however, a response to this unjustifiable heartbreak; the
response is found in the path that the parents take in grieving the lost
child in which they incorporate and integrate the loss into their lives.
Rabbi Kushner’s extremely important point about the answer to the death of
a loved one coming in the form of a response to the tragedy rather than as
any kind of reason explaining or justifying it has some bearing on the theory
of karma as well (the premise that what goes around comes around).
Exploring the Impact of Losing a Child
The loss of a child of any age is a parent’s worst nightmare. No other pro-
found loss seems quite as difficult to integrate into one’s life because the loss
of a child represents both a cosmic injustice and a forfeiture of a potential
and anticipated future. When a child dies, the parents must mourn not only
his passing but also the demise of all the hopes, dreams, and plans that they
had for the child. In the event that the child is an only child, the parents also
may mourn their legacy to a future generation.
This section looks at the impact of losing a child at various stages and ages,
from conception all the way to adulthood. I start with the loss of a child
before or at birth, including the grief caused by a lack of fertility and the abil-
ity to even conceive and have children. Then I profile the grief caused by the
death of a child after birth — as an infant, toddler, young child, teenager, and
finally as an adult.
Experiencing the loss of fertility
No one feels the loss of a potential and anticipated future more than a couple
who desperately wants to have children but finds out that, for whatever rea-
sons, they’re infertile. Instead of mourning children that they’ve cared so
much for, they mourn the children they will never meet and never have a
chance to care for.
On the surface, the pain of the inability to have children may appear not as
great as that caused by the loss of living children; however, by no means is
100
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

that the case. After all, infertile couples have no body to bury, no memories
(however many or few) to look back on and find comfort in, no support
groups to shepherd them through the acute stages of the grief, and very few
sympathetic folks who can or want to understand and console them.
The only thing that can mitigate this loss at all is translating this longing for
children into some sort of other parenting experience, such as foster care,
adoption, or even mentoring children in the community. The only problem
with this compromise is that, although these solutions can fill the parenting
needs for some couples, they can also be a reminder of what the couple can’t
have in their lives. As such, the alternate parenting experience can be a cause
for renewed grief as well as for joy.
If you find yourself in this situation, grieve the loss of fertility as you would
mourn the loss of any loved one before you undertake any alternate parent-
ing experiences. With the right preparation, the alternate experience has a
chance to become an integral part of your healing as well as a way of incorpo-
rating the loss into your life.
Experiencing the loss of a 
child through abortion
Abortion is one of the thorniest issues facing modern society. It raises deep
philosophical and religious questions about both the sanctity and the autono-
my of human life (that is, the fetus’s right to come to term versus the woman’s
right to control her own body and determine her own future). It’s also one of
those hot-button issues about which people on both sides usually feel so
strongly that they’re much more apt to hurl slogans back and forth than
engage in a meaningful debate and civil discussion.
Keep in mind that, for most women, deciding to abort is an agonizing and
extremely difficult decision. Reasons for going through with the procedure
run the gamut from the baby’s high risk of serious birth defects and a critical
threat to the woman’s health during the pregnancy or at childbirth to facing
severe economic and domestic adversities that make it nigh onto impossible
to support and rear the child.
A woman who mourns the loss of her pregnancy as a result of an abortion is
not in the same position as a woman who loses it on account of a miscarriage
(which I discuss later in this chapter). Because the abortion procedure is the
result of her own decision, the woman must often deal with her ambivalence
about making that choice as well as her grief over the loss of the child. This
grief is often complicated by any guilt she feels about terminating the preg-
nancy as well as any shame that she takes on as a result of disapproval
expressed by her family or other members of her community.
101
Chapter 6: The Loss of Children

If you have an abortion for medical reasons and are part of a couple who other-
wise would have had the child, you and your partner can support each other
in your grieving. However, if you’re on your own with limited or no support
from the biological father or your family, you’re left to grieve the loss alone.
Experiencing grief alone is particularly difficult at any age, but if you’re still a
teenager or young adult (as many are who undergo this procedure), you may
lack some of the emotional maturity necessary to deal with this burden. This
is definitely the time to seek out the help of a professional grief counselor
(see Chapter 14).
In grieving this type of loss, you have to confront any guilt you feel over your
decision before you can begin grieving the loss of the prospective child.
Separate your feelings about abortion from those of your religious tradition
and society at large. Doing so may require the help of a professional coun-
selor or therapist who’s skilled in dealing with this type of trauma.
Experiencing the loss of a 
child through adoption
Women who decide against abortion (or have no access to the procedure)
but who aren’t in a situation in which to raise their babies are faced with the
102
Part I: Contemplating Grief 
Mizuko Jizo and the Mizuko ceremony
Jizo is a Bodhisattva (kind of like a saint) in
Mahayana Buddhism who is known as the pro-
tector of all innocents and travelers in both the
physical and spiritual realms. In particular,
Mizuko Jizo (Mizuko literally means water-baby
and is the name given to the fetus) is the
guardian of stillborn, miscarried, and aborted
fetuses and shepherds them in their journey
through the spiritual realm. Modern Japanese
have developed a Mizuko ceremony that enables
families (particularly mothers) to participate in
a rite that honors their unborn children or chil-
dren who died at birth. This ceremony is con-
ducted in a memorial garden and usually
involves prayers and chants and placing a stone
with a carved statue of Jizo as a grave marker
for the child. Families can return to the memor-
ial garden to honor and remember their lost chil-
dren by decorating the stone marker, bathing
the Jizo statue, or burning incense and lighting
candles before it.
In America, more and more Buddhist temples
and Zen centers are setting up memorial gar-
dens and conducting Mizuko ceremonies for
grieving mothers and their families. Contact
your nearest Buddhist temple or Zen center to
find out if it has such a memorial garden and
conducts this type of memorial service. Also,

heartbreak of losing their children through adoption. As with a decision to
terminate pregnancy, the decision to give up one’s baby for adoption is never
an easy one. And although this decision is almost always made in the hope of
giving the child the best possible future, it’s one that more often than not is
fraught with second-guessing and self-doubt on the part of the mother.
Grieving the loss of a child that, though unplanned, you wanted but just
couldn’t keep can be a lifelong endeavor. The only memory that you may
have of your baby is giving birth to him or her. Each anniversary of the
baby’s birth and each Mother’s Day is an occasion to grieve the loss as well
as an opportunity to wonder about what has become of your child and
whether or not you made the correct decision.
Adding to this sense of sorrow and uncertainty, you may wrestle with the fol-
lowing issues:
 Whether you’ll ever be reunited with your adopted child
 Whether, if you are reunited, the child will rebuff you for giving him up
for adoption or will find it in his heart to understand the situation and
forgive you
Keep in mind that many adopted children elect not to contact their birth par-
ents, so many mothers never find out whether or not their children experi-
enced the futures that they had hoped for when giving the children up for
adoption. As a result, these mothers are plagued with a real sense of ambigu-
ity regarding the wisdom of the original decision.
See Chapter 10 for suggestions on how to deal with guilt and forgiving your-
self if you’re having doubts about your adoption decision and if your feelings
are hampering your ability to grieve the loss of the child.
Experiencing a prenatal or perinatal loss
Prenatal loss of a child occurs during pregnancy as a result of a miscarriage (a
loss of a fetus before it has developed enough to live on its own). Perinatal
loss of a child occurs during birth (in which the child is considered stillborn)
or shortly thereafter (most often because the child is very premature or suf-
fers from some birth defect).
Both types of child loss are extremely grueling for the prospective parents
(especially for the mother, who carried the baby). After time spent preparing
for the new baby and the anticipated joy of his or her birth, the parents are
left only with heartbreak. They leave the hospital alone and often return to a
103
Chapter 6: The Loss of Children

home with a fully equipped nursery where they must bear their disappoint-
ment and grief.
Your grief is made more difficult in the case of miscarriage if you don’t have a
burial or funeral ceremony for the child. (Note that most funeral homes are
prepared to conduct funerals and memorials for children who die under any
circumstances.) You and your partner don’t have that public acknowledg-
ment of your loss or the comfort it brings to parents whose children died in
childbirth or shortly thereafter and were then buried. Refer to the sidebar
“Mizuko Jizo and the Mizuko ceremony” for information on a ritual for honor-
ing and remembering children lost from a prenatal or perinatal loss.
If your pregnancy was public knowledge, you can expect people outside the
immediate family to ask you about your baby after you experience a loss.
Answer this simple but dreaded question with an equally simple answer that
you had the baby and that she or he didn’t survive. The problem is that this
kind of innocent encounter brings up the pain of the loss and may cause the
questioner to become embarrassed (when there’s really no reason for it). As
a result, you can find yourself in the position of trying to allay his discomfort,
which is awkward and difficult given your own feelings.
Keep in mind that you’re not responsible for another’s feelings of awkward-
ness or discomfort around death and grief. If it feels appropriate, you can let
the other person know that it’s okay if he doesn’t know how to express shock
and sorrow over your loss.
Experiencing the death of an infant
Babies are the most innocent and pure beings one can conceive of. (Just
thinking about a baby let alone being around one brings a smile to most
people’s faces.) Therefore, any neonatal loss (the death of a baby within the
first month of his or her life) or loss of an infant is associated with a loss of
innocence. (A child who is unable to walk and talk is considered an infant.
The term literally means “incapable of speech.”)
Perhaps the most common and most alarming type of infant death is SIDS
(Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). SIDS is frightening not only because it
occurs without warning in otherwise healthy babies but also because its
causes are unexplained. Given the mysterious nature of SIDS, parents who
experience this type of loss can be plagued with a lot of doubt that can easily
turn into guilt and blame finding.
How deeply the loss wounds the parents and immediate family is often a
function of the cause of the infant’s death. When the death is clearly not in
104
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

the hands of the parents, as in the case of an unpreventable disease or birth
defect, it can be much less injurious than when the parents bear some or all
responsibility, such as in the case of neglect or abuse of the baby. Of course,
a gray area exists in cases where the death is due to a preventable accident
and poor judgment or a total lack of it contributed to the baby’s death.
If you, as the parent, feel guilt over the death of your infant (even if your guilt
is completely unwarranted), it’s likely that your feelings are amplified by the
fact that a total innocent died with his whole life before him. Grieving the loss
of an infant, then, is a lot like grieving infertility in that you mourn the loss of
anticipated futures — both the baby’s and your own as you would have expe-
rienced the joy of parenthood.
Because you’re in high nurture mode when your baby is first born, it’s nat-
ural that you view your infant’s death as the result of your inability to prop-
erly care for your child. You must deal with such feelings as part of your
grieving, especially if you have other children who need nurturing or if you’re
planning to have more children in the future.
Experiencing the death of a young child
By the time your child progresses from infancy into the toddler stage
(between 1 and 3 years of age), he’s well on the way to becoming an individ-
ual with his own personality expressed in language, movement, and beyond
all else, disposition. From then on, you’re confronted with spurts of growth
and development.
The loss of a young child within the age range of toddler to preteen is com-
pounded by your familiarity with the child’s personality and nascent abilities.
Unlike experiencing a neonatal or infant loss, in which parents lose the
opportunity to really get to know their child, the parents of a young child
who dies lose the opportunity to get to know how their child turns out.
Using an analogy to writing, losing an infant is like a promising story where
just the beginning gets written and you’re left to wonder what the tale would
have been like. Losing a young child, on the other hand, is like a story where
the first part is written but you’re still left to wonder how the tale turns out.
Certainly, depending upon the circumstances of death, you may not only
grieve the loss of your child but also question what you could have done dif-
ferently to prevent the death. Keep in mind that feelings of guilt and second-
guessing, while certainly understandable, aren’t conducive to grieving the
loss. Often you need to attend to these feelings before the real grieving can
begin.
105
Chapter 6: The Loss of Children

Because parents who lose a child have a definite image of the person they’ve
lost, it’s all the more important for them to memorialize the child. When cre-
ating this memorial, you can make it something physical, such as a special
Christmas ornament, memory book, and the like (see Chapter 19 for ideas on
memorials). You also may make this memorial something intangible, such as
remembering the lost child at all family celebrations and gatherings and
including him whenever you mention the order of all your children.
Experiencing the death of a teenager
As anyone knows who has a teenage child or even remembers what it was
like to be one, teenagers are absolutely convinced that they’re indestructible.
Unfortunately, parents who have experienced the loss of a teenage child can
attest that this belief couldn’t be more false.
Regardless of how or why the death occurs, the loss of a teenager is devastat-
ing given that the child was in the prime of life and poised to become an inde-
pendent adult. Going back to my analogy relating the death of a child to
writing, it’s as though the story comes to an abrupt end after the personality
of the story’s character was fully developed, the story’s beginning was told,
and the middle of the story was just about to commence.
Teen suicide is a special case. In most cases, suicide is not accidental and is
considered preventable. It frequently comes as the conclusion of a long strug-
gle with depression. Suicide may be completely unexpected, but it also may
be preceded by unsuccessful attempts to take one’s life.
Because society in general and many religions in particular look down on sui-
cide, this type of death carries a stigma that other types of death do not. As a
result, a family dealing with the death of a teenager by his own hand has to
deal with a lot more than simple grief. Turn to Chapter 2 for more on suicide
and its aftermath.
Experiencing the death of an adult child
No matter how old their children get, parents continue to see them as kids 
in great need of parental guidance. When an adult child dies, whatever the
cause, the overwhelming feeling is that nature’s order has been turned
upside down; in other words, in a perfect world, children would always 
bury their parents and not vice versa.
106
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

The death of an adult child is often accompanied by a deep questioning of
natural order and the innate justice of the universe (expressed in terms of
God’s plan in the case of religious people).
Because adult children often have families of their own, their deaths also may
bring about a profound change in family dynamics. As a grandparent, you
may be confronted suddenly with the challenge of helping your child’s family
cope with the loss financially as well as emotionally. In some cases, you even
may be called upon to take your grandchildren in and raise them.
These kinds of challenges compound the wound that you feel over the unfair-
ness of a world in which children don’t always outlive their own parents.
Many times, parents who lose adult children have to deal with their feelings
about the inequity of the death as part of grieving their loss.
Adult children, especially when they’ve just started their careers or families,
are lost right at the time when their lives have the most impact on their com-
munities. This factor plays into the sense of tragedy and injustice that par-
ents and other family members associate with the untimely death.
The Impact of a Child’s Death 
on the Parents’ Relationship
Regardless of the age of the child or the reason for his or her death, the loss
of a child inevitably has a profound impact on the immediate family. The sur-
viving children have to deal with the loss of a sibling as well as a change in
the pecking order (see Chapter 5 for details). The parents have to deal not
only with their grief over the profound loss but also with the challenges this
loss presents to their marriage or partnership. They also may suffer a loss of
identity as parents accompanied by upsurges of grief at what would other-
wise have been milestones in the child’s life (graduations, proms, and so on).
Even if the partnership didn’t suffer from serious communication problems
prior to the child’s death, such problems can arise easily after the loss of a
child. Many times, this is the first occasion for the parents to grieve the same
profound loss. It even may be the first instance in which either of the parents
has experienced any kind of profound loss and experienced this kind of
intense grief.
The different manner in which you and your partner each express your grief
sometimes leads to misunderstandings and, in some cases, even to a break-
down in communication. This communication breakdown is compounded
107
Chapter 6: The Loss of Children

when either of you becomes withdrawn from the other, which is common
when trying to process this type of profound loss.
More often than not, the father tends to keep his emotions to himself, while
the mother expresses her emotions more openly. Mom may come to the con-
clusion that Dad isn’t grieving as much as she is. Things can go downhill
quickly if Mom starts questioning whether Dad’s lack of outward mourning
means that he didn’t really loved their child. Mom may then question whether
or not Dad really loves her. Misunderstanding and lack of communication are
ingredients in the perfect recipe for a marriage disaster.
As a parent under the strain of dealing with the loss of a child, you must be
very careful not to alienate your partner as part of processing your own grief.
Although grieving the loss of a child can bring couples closer together and
strengthen their marriage, it also can open rifts that eventually threaten the
very existence of the relationship. The intense emotions and deep hurt
brought on by the loss can become destructive to the marriage when they’re
leveled at one of the partners.
If you’re part of a couple grieving the loss of a child, be very aware of the
danger of blaming your partner in any way as you question whether or how
this loss could have been prevented. Given the intensity of emotions on both
sides, you run a great risk of isolating yourself from your partner and eroding
(and perhaps even permanently damaging) the trust you’ve cultivated in one
another.
Because grieving a child as a couple is fraught with many twists and turns,
consider seeking professional counseling to help you and your partner stay
in communication with one another. If you decide to make use of a marriage
counselor, try to find one with some experience counseling couples in crisis
over the loss of a child. If you can’t find such a marriage counselor, consider
using the services of a bereavement counselor with experience in family
counseling. Turn to Chapter 14 for more information on locating and making
use of professional support and counseling.
Resources for Healing the Loss of a Child
Resources for guiding and supporting you through the loss of a child are
numerous and include some very good books on the death of children as well
as some very solid online resources. In addition to consulting the resources
listed in this section, you may want to join a local grief support group that
deals specifically with the loss of children or participate in one-on-one ses-
sions with a grief counselor in your area. Chapter 14 contains general infor-
mation on grief support groups and counseling along with suggestions on
how best to go about locating these resources in the area where you live.

H
ow children understand the profound losses they suffer is closely
related to their mental and emotional development, which is most often
a direct function of their age. Generally speaking, the younger the child, the
more concrete the thinking, so younger children have more trouble under-
standing the concept of death. Older children and adolescents, who concep-
tually comprehend death, often still have difficulties accepting its reality,
especially when it happens to an immediate family member or a really close
friend.
Occasionally compounding the problems that children naturally have with
first understanding and then accepting the loss is the reluctance that many
families have to include children in the formal mourning of loss. Children
often are excluded from funerals as well as less formal mourning rites such as
visiting grave sites because of the belief that doing so protects the children
from undue and unnecessary pain.
This chapter examines the grief that children undergo when they suffer a pro-
found loss. I divide this important topic into two parts: how children look at
and understand profound loss in their lives, and how you can help them actu-
ally grieve these losses.

Helping Children Understand Death
Even adults who have a firm grasp on the notion of death and its permanence
often have trouble accepting the reality of a profound loss when it first occurs.
Just imagine how much more difficult it is for a child whose concept of death
is every bit as vague as his understanding of forever.
A child’s understanding of death is often a function of his age and how he
experiences and comprehends time. Younger children live almost totally in
the present, so they have no way to grasp a permanent, lasting change like
death. They only see things in terms of what is or isn’t directly in their envi-
ronments, understanding that a loved one who has died is now no longer
there for them to love.
As children grow older and have explored the concept of time in the future
and past, they begin to grasp the irreversible nature of death. As a result,
they have to come to terms with the idea that the losses they suffer are ones
from which there is no reprieve and ones that they’ll have to live with the
rest of their lives. As you may expect, this more complete understanding of
death brings a new level of grief with it: In addition to the anxiety that natu-
rally arises from the absence of a loved one, the child also feels the stark pain
that comes from the realization that this loss is one that will never change.
Children’s different concepts of death
Adults tend to think of death as being quite a concrete phenomenon, but to
young children, death is often one of the more abstract, challenging concepts
they encounter. Part of the problem is that they’re far too young to have a
clear understanding of anything that’s irreversible and lasts forever. Another
part of the problem is the way that they see death portrayed in some of the
cartoons and digital games — a character can be laid flatter than a pancake
or blown to smithereens in one moment only to return to the screen right as
rain in the next moment.
Table 7-1 gives you a general idea of the prevailing views and feelings that
children in different age groups have concerning death. Note how the views
move from the more concrete to the more abstract as the child gets older
and he becomes aware of his own mortality and fear of his own death.

Table 7-1
Concepts of Death by Children of Various Ages
Age Range
Prevalent Views and Feelings
Infancy to toddler
No concept of death; reacts to the grief expressed by
others in the immediate environment, especially parents
3 to 5 years old
Vague concept of death; denies death as a final process;
often equates death with sleep from which one will
awaken; believes in degrees of death (from kind of dead to
really dead); may understand death as something that
happens to other people
6 to 9 years old
Clearer concept of death; understands that he and people
he loves can die; often sees death of a loved one as a
punishment for his own behavior and not being good
10 to 12 years old
Sees death as final and inescapable; is curious about bio-
logical aspects of death; hides fear of death by joking about
it; may feel some responsibility for death of a loved one
Teenage years
Vacillates between seeing death as final and feeling
immortal; can become preoccupied with death; may
engage in high-risk behavior to defy his own mortality
Explaining and discussing 
death with a child
If you can help it, don’t wait to discuss death with your child until he experi-
ences the profound loss of a family member or close friend. By explaining
death to your child before a loss, you ensure better communication with him
when a loss does occur. You also stand a much better chance of helping him
through his grief.
When you set out to discuss death with your child, follow these guidelines:
 Use the death of a family pet or even the passing of the seasons 
to illustrate the concept of death and as a natural segue into the 
discussion.
 Don’t use euphemisms for death. State clearly that so-and-so has died
instead of “passed away,” and never tell a child that the person is “lost
to us” (unless you want your child to wait patiently for the person to be
found or to actually set out looking for him).
 Don’t equate death with sleep (unless you want your child to expect
the dead person to wake up one day and return).
113
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

 Discuss death openly with your child, answering whatever questions
that he has honestly and with whatever amount of detailed informa-
tion he wants that’s appropriate to his level of understanding.
 Avoid using clichés. The judgments behind clichés such as “God wanted
him to be in heaven” and “It’s always for the best” can distort the child’s
view of grieving as well as discourage him from discussing the subject with
you. (See Chapter 20 for more on clichés and why they aren’t helpful.)
Informing a child about a death
Parents often have questions about how and when to inform their children
about the death of a loved one. They want to know whether there’s a right
time to tell children about a loss as well as how much detail about the event
they should give.
By and large, professionals who deal with children and grief recommend the
following guidelines regarding informing a child about the death of a loved one:
 Inform the child of the death as soon as you possibly can. You don’t
want to child to hear about the death from someone outside the family.
 Explain what happened to the loved one as clearly, simply, and factu-
ally as you can. Keep in mind that the language you use in describing 
the cause of death needs to be appropriate to the child’s age and 
development.
 When answering a child’s questions regarding the cause of death and
what happened to the body, ask the child what he really wants to know
and give only the information necessary to answer that particular
question. Some kids want to know every detail whereas others only
want and need certain information.
 If you have spiritual beliefs regarding life after death, discuss them
with your child, but be aware that if you make it sound like the death
is God’s doing, you run the risk of prejudicing the child against God.
When discussing a death with a young child (especially one between the ages
of 3 and 5), be prepared to answer the same questions over and over again
(some kids are relentless in this regard). Also, be aware that this is the age of
“magical thinking” when children often feel as though they caused the death
simply because they thought it or wished it would happen. Therefore, they
may feel a great deal of guilt over the death of a loved one (sometimes much
more than adults) and may need plenty of reassurance that they were in no
way responsible for the loss. (You may need to repeat this message over and
over again and be relentless in this regard.)
114
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Understanding How Children Grieve
The first fact about how children grieve that you need to understand is that
children grieve the profound loss of a loved one just as much as (and some-
times more than) adults. However, because their verbal skills are usually less
developed than adults’, children tend to display the emotions surrounding
their grief in more concrete ways.
This means that you can expect to see more-acute physical and behavioral
changes in a grieving child than you would see in a grieving adult. A child’s
emotional response to the loss may manifest and play out in more physical
than verbal ways.
The fact that children may not be all that verbal with their emotions doesn’t
mean that speaking with your child about his feelings about the loss does no
good. Just keep in mind that talking about the loss may not be as beneficial
for your child as it may be for you as an adult. Suggest and participate in
other activities in which the child can express his feelings (check out the 
section “Helping Your Child Grieve,” later in this chapter, for some specific
suggestions).
Common emotional reactions to death
No matter how well you explain death and how openly you discuss it with
your child, he’ll exhibit his own response to a profound loss according to his
age and related stage of development. Table 7-2 gives you a general rundown
of the common reactions to death that you can expect from children in vari-
ous age groups.
Table 7-2
Common Reactions to Death by Children of Various Ages

Responses
Infancy to toddler
Cries easily and clings more to parents; experiences a

fearful of being separated from parents; shows no con-
cern over the death

Chapter 7: Children and Grief
(continued)

Table 7-2 (continued)
Age Range
Responses
10 to 12 years
Develops separation anxiety; loses manual dexterity; has
difficulty concentrating (school grades may suffer);
becomes emotionally distant
Teenage years
Assumes an adult role with younger siblings; angers
quickly and shows aggression easily; becomes preoccu-
pied with death; may become suicidal or attempt suicide
as a gesture
As you can see in Table 7-2, anxiety is the common reaction to death in all age
groups. Therefore, regardless of the child’s age, as a parent or guardian, you
need to be particularly available to the child during this stressful time. One of
the most effective ways to do this is by frequently reassuring him both physi-
cally and verbally whenever you can. In other words, hold him more and let
him know that you’re there to listen to his feelings and even share your own.
In addition to heightened anxiety, children also feel all the other emotions
that adults contend with during grieving. These may include any of the fol-
lowing feelings:
 Sadness: Children commonly feel sad over a death and may become
melancholy and down in the dumps, if not weepy, at the drop of a hat.
Teenagers can become despondent and even suicidal in some cases.
 Loneliness: Death often makes children feel abandoned and alone. They
may alienate themselves from the rest of the family and even from their
friends and schoolmates.
 Apathy: Children often become lethargic and feel emotionally flat 
after the loss of a loved one. They may lose interest in school as well 
as activities they enjoyed before the death. In some cases, a child may
become clinically depressed and need professional and medical help
(see Chapter 11 for more on death and depression).
 Relief: Older children may feel secretly relieved over the death and then
feel very guilty about feeling that way. Feelings of relief may result from
the end of a loved one’s suffering as well as from no longer being subject
to the loved one’s strictures and influence (this is especially true when
child abuse is involved).
 Helplessness: The general sense of powerlessness that children feel is
often heightened by the loss of a loved one (especially a parent). As a
result of this new level of vulnerability, they can become quite clingy
and emotionally needy.
116
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

 Impatience: Children often become much more easily frustrated and
less able to cope with changes and new challenges after a death. They
may be easily aggravated by setbacks of any kind and easily stymied by
problems they encounter.
 Anger: Anger is a recurrent emotion that both children and adults expe-
rience when grieving the loss of a loved one. In children, the anger often
presents itself in the form of resentment, although it also can show up as
a full-blown rage directed at the loved one for dying and leaving them
alone.
Common physical reactions to death
Emotional responses to grief often have physical manifestations in children.
When dealing with a child who’s grieving a loss, you need to pay attention to
any new physical problems that your child experiences so that you can deter-
mine whether or not these physical reactions are related to the child’s grief
and get him the appropriate help.
Some of the more frequent physical problems that grieving children experi-
ence can include:
 Headaches
 Stomachaches, nausea, and diarrhea
 Heart palpitations (often as a racing heart)
 Nightmares
 Shortness of breath and tightness in the throat
 Teeth grinding and tightness in the jaw
 Shortness of breath, dizziness, and feeling faint
 Tightness in the chest and muscle tension and pain (especially in the
neck and shoulders)
 Fatigue and general weakness
In addition to the general ailments in this list, teenage girls who are grieving
may experience irregularity in their menstrual cycles. The stress and anxiety
from grief may cause a teenage girl to skip her period for several months in a
row after the death.
117
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

Sometimes when a loved one dies from an illness, a child may become fearful
that the physical problems he’s experiencing as a result of the stress of the
loss and grieving are actually symptoms of the same disease. He may even
secretly question whether he’ll also die from the same disease. This may be a
situation where you want to be very clear about the cause of the loved one’s
death and give extra reassurance to the child that he’s in no danger of dying
from the same illness.
Common behavioral reactions to death
Behaviors rather than words are the hallmarks of childhood. Therefore, it’s
highly unusual for your child to go through grieving a loss without manifest-
ing some behavioral changes. Naturally, some of the behaviors that children
exhibit when under the stress of a loss and grief are more disconcerting and
more dangerous than others.
Some of the more common behavioral changes you may notice in your child
can include:
 Accident-proneness: Grieving children (especially adolescent boys) 
are much more prone to accidents in the first year after the death than
nongrieving children. This increase in accidents may be related to an
increase in absentmindedness as well as an inclination toward riskier
behaviors.
 Weepiness: Some grieving children exhibit this behavior through sudden
outbursts of crying, whereas others show it through a more general tear-
ful state. Weepiness can indicate both that the child misses the loved
one and that he feels anxiety over the changes that this loss has brought
to his life.
 Clinginess: This behavior is common in the case of a child who loses
one parent and then becomes exceedingly anxious over the possibility
of losing the other one. As a result, he becomes overly protective of the
surviving parent and often quite distressed at being separated from him
or her.
 Absentmindedness: Concentration routinely suffers in grieving children
(and adults) as a result of the shock of the loss and the energy required
to deal with it. For many children, this behavior becomes most notice-
able when they have trouble keeping up and completing schoolwork and
their grades go down.
 Listlessness: Often referred to as depression, a child can exhibit this
behavior through a general lack of energy and increased fatigue as well
as a decided lack of interest in his normal activities.
118
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

 Hyperactivity: Older children and adolescents may feel the need to
become superbusy after a death. This heightened level of activity is usu-
ally related to additional school and extracurricular activities. Often, the
child’s hyperactivity is a defense against having to feel the pain of the
loss and suffer the grief, and it can become a problem if it blocks the
grieving process.
 Regressive behaviors: Normally seen in younger children, these can
include behaviors such as thumb sucking, taking a teddy bear to bed,
and even bed-wetting that your child has long since given up but that he
returns to in this time of great stress.
 Risky behaviors: Normally seen in teenagers (especially boys), these
behaviors can include indulging in alcohol and drugs, undertaking 
activities that purposely place the adolescent’s life at risk, such as
death-defying stunts, reckless driving, and engaging in unsafe sexual
activity, and making gestures of or actually attempting suicide.
Of all the risky behaviors in this list, the threat of a teen suicide after a death
calls for the greatest concern. Suicide rates are already high enough among
teenagers who haven’t suffered such traumas; the extra strain of the loss and
despair from the grief (not to mention any guilt surrounding the death) can
be a deadly catalyst that turns a teen’s idle talk into an actual attempt. If your
teenage child talks about or threatens suicide, take it very seriously and don’t
hesitate to get the help you need (either from a suicide prevention organiza-
tion or a professional grief counselor) to deal with this threat before an
attempt actually happens.
Helping Your Child Grieve
Before you can help your child grieve a loss, you need to believe that he’s
entitled to it. Until very recently, many families routinely excluded children
from all formal mourning (see the sidebar “Children and funerals: To go or
not to go”) and even some informal grieving for immediate family members
on the false assumptions that
 Children don’t need to grieve losses in the same way as adults.
 Children are protected when they aren’t drawn into grieving the loss.
In response to this type of thinking, certain grief professionals and groups
such as the American Academy of Bereavement have developed a so-called
Bill of Rights for Grieving Children.
119
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

In short, this bill of rights says that a child not only has the right to grieve
but also has the right to grieve in his or her own way. Also important among
the principles in the Bill of Rights for Grieving Children are the tenets that the
child has the right to question the cause of death and the right to memorial-
ize the lost loved one. This right to remember the deceased includes being
entitled to speak about the loved one as well as visit the grave site or ceme-
tery on special anniversaries.
The family’s influence 
on children’s grieving
Immediate families exhibit different styles of behavior that make up their
characters (and their quirks). For example, some families are open in terms
of communicating feelings, and others are closed. Some families are emotion-
ally warm and supporting of each other, whereas others are cooler and more
distant.
How the parents in a family work as a team to adapt to change and deal with
crises often determines how well the family functions in an emergency. The
parents’ ability or inability in this area has a great influence on how readily
children accept the loss and how easily they deal with it.
120
Part I: Contemplating Grief 
Children and funerals: To go or not to go
One of the big questions that parents frequently
have after a death in the family is whether the
children should be involved in formal mourning
rites such as attending the funeral. Some par-
ents feel very strongly that their child needs to
attend the funeral in order to make the death
real and to toughen him up and introduce him to
the harsher realities of life. Others feel just as
strongly that the funeral is no place for a child
and that attending this sad event will only fur-
ther traumatize him after the death.
Current thinking is that you include the child in
the funeral only if he wants to attend. The think-
ing is that forcing a child to attend a funeral
when he’s really uncomfortable with the idea is
the only way in which the event can be trau-
matic. Nowadays, many families include their
children in all the mourning rites in the belief
that doing so affords the children an opportunity
to say goodbye as well as lets them know that
death, although sad, isn’t the frightening taboo
that it may otherwise seem to be.

Most families fall into one of the following categories, which are determined
by how the family behaves in the face of a crisis, such as a death in the family:
 Rigid: In this inflexible family style, the family tries to resist a crisis most
often by assigning blame. Fault finding and guilt remain the primary
behaviors during the emergency.
This family style makes children’s grieving the most difficult because the
blame game and guilt doom efforts to accept the loss and deal with the
feelings that come from it.
 Reserved: In this stoic family style, the family tries to endure a crisis
with a stiff upper lip. Denial and emotional detachment are the primary
behaviors during the emergency.
The second most difficult family style for children’s grieving often makes
it impossible for children to express their feelings of grief. The more
reserved the family’s response is to a death in the family, the more diffi-
cult grieving is for the children.
 Chaotic: In this disorganized family style, the family simply attempts to
get through a crisis any way it can. Confusion and upheaval are the pri-
mary behaviors during the emergency.
The family’s emotional turmoil isn’t conducive to helping calm the chil-
dren’s anxiety over the loss, but it doesn’t have to be detrimental pro-
vided that the parents can remain emotionally open and accessible.
 Open: In this accessible family style, the family tries to remain open and
caring during a crisis. Intimacy and communication remain the priorities
during the emergency.
Naturally, the more open and emotionally supportive that a family is to
each other during a crisis caused by a death in the family, the easier it is
for the children to get in touch with their feelings and grieve.
Together, the characteristics of rigid and reserved types of families form a
lethal combination that can completely shut down the grieving process, forc-
ing children to carry unresolved grief with them sometimes all the way into
adulthood.
Guidelines for supporting grieving children
Anxiety is a principal emotion for children newly saddled with the grief 
from a profound loss. The first thing that parents can do to help their griev-
ing children is to reassure them and do everything they can to reduce this
anxiousness.
121
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

Here are a few hints on how you can help reduce the level of anxiety initially
caused by a profound loss:
 Stay close to your child, reassuring him of your love and sharing activi-
ties with him. He’ll benefit from your physical presence and lots of extra
hugs and kisses.
 Speak with your child as openly as you can about what has happened,
always keeping in mind his current stage of development (refer to the
section “Understanding How Children Grieve,” earlier in the chapter).
Share your feelings when appropriate, and if you don’t know something,
be honest and tell him that.
 Maintain as much of the normal family routine as possible, including din-
nertime, chores, homework, bedtimes, and the like.
 Be prepared to break with the normal family routine as soon as you see
your child is having real trouble maintaining it. (For example, many
times, a grieving child has difficulty concentrating on homework and
sleeping through the night.)
 Spend extra time quiet time with your child at bedtime. This quiet time
can include reading his favorite bedtime stories (you may even want to
include some age-appropriate titles about death; see the section “Books
for young children who are grieving,” at the end of this chapter), playing
his favorite games, or talking about the deceased.
 Safeguard your child’s health by seeing to it that he continues to get the
nutrition, exercise, and rest he needs. (This is often a tall order and a
real challenge, especially during the acute phase of grieving.)
 Speak with your child’s teachers and appropriate staff at his school
about the loss, and enlist their help in reporting any changes in behavior
that may be linked to the loss and indicate difficulties in dealing with it.
Whenever possible, postpone making big changes in your family’s life for at
least a year and a half or more after the death. For example, the hardest
change for a grieving child is moving to a new residence, especially when 
this entails having to attend a new school and make new friends.
Activities to facilitate children’s grieving
Because children are such concrete thinkers, having activities to do often
helps them with the grieving process. All these activities should have one of
two purposes: to encourage the child to express his feelings over the loss or
to memorialize the lost loved one.
122
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

To help children express their anger and frustration over a death, many par-
ents organize an area or a room in the house, basement, or garage where the
children can vent their feelings. If you create such an area, stock it with items
that make noise and enable the children to act out safely, including:
 Old pillows for them to punch
 Old telephone books, newspapers, and magazines for them to rip apart
 Foam bats for them to hit the floor and walls with
 Punching bags for them to hit and kick
 Puppets, dolls, or stuffed animals with which they can interact and
express their feelings
To help younger children express their feelings about the loss and remember
their loved ones, gather paints, rolls of paper, and other artistic materials so
that they can paint or draw pictures to express their feelings. Supply older
children and adolescents with journals in which they can record their feelings.
To help children of all ages, collect family photos that include the lost loved
one and create albums together that you can look at later while sharing
favorite stories and memories. Do the same with family videos, creating
movies of family events and vacations that incorporate the loved one’s
favorite songs and music.
You can still memorialize your loved one even if you don’t have photos for
scrapbooks or videos for home movies. Simply arrange times when the family
gathers and each family member shares a favorite memory or relates an
important or amusing story that involves the deceased.
Holding memorial storytelling events is a crucial element in successfully sur-
viving the holidays and anniversaries after a death. They allow you to honor
and remember the absent loved one as well as make him present and part of
the event. See Chapter 16 for more suggestions on getting through holidays
and anniversaries after the loss of a loved one.
Getting children involved in new outside activities
Very often a death in the family leaves a child feeling particularly helpless. To
help combat this feeling and boost his self-esteem, get him involved in some
new activities outside the home. These activities can be physical or creative
in nature depending upon his interests and natural inclinations.
123
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

Such outside activities can include:
 Art or drama classes
 Music lessons
 Team sports such as softball, soccer, and basketball
 Martial arts classes such as karate, judo, and tae kwon do
 Volunteer activities in the community such as visiting seniors or helping
at an animal shelter
Volunteering in the community, although usually open only to older children
and teenagers, can be a really marvelous way for grieving children to recon-
nect and heal their grief (it also works wonders for grieving adults). Check
out Chapter 18 for more suggestions on ways to help out and integrate your
grief all at the same time.
Creative projects for grieving children
The ability to express one’s feelings through art is really not a function of a
person’s age or literacy. That being said, expressing one’s feelings through
art offers a particularly effective way for children to convey and reflect upon
their grief.
Here are some artistic and creative projects that you may suggest to your
child or even do with him:
 Draw a picture of the way he’s feeling today.
 Draw a picture depicting a favorite activity he shared with the family
member who died.
 Create a collage with photos and other objects that remind him of his
favorite times with the family member who died.
 Plant a memorial garden with the family member’s favorite flowers or in
his favorite colors.
 Create a pendant or paint a stone that your child can carry around to
remind him of the family member.
 Make a rock garden with stones representing each member of the family
that depicts their relationships to one another and especially to the
deceased.
Older children and adolescents can express their grief not only through art
projects such as these but also through writing about their feelings and expe-
riences. You can suggest any of the following writing activities to your child:
124
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

 A letter in which he expresses how much he misses the family member
who died or says farewell to this person if he wasn’t able to do so before
death.
 A story in which he relates a favorite memory involving the family
member who died.
 A daily journal in which the child communicates to the family member
who died his changing feelings and thoughts.
Dealing with problems 
in children’s grieving
A child’s grieving process, while similar in nature to an adult’s (and often
modeled after the way the parents and other adults in the family grieve),
doesn’t always follow the same general pattern. For example, children (espe-
cially in the age range 6 to 9) have an amazing capacity for grieving intermit-
tently. One moment they can be quite downcast from the grief and quite
literally the next moment be running around and playing as though nothing in
the world were wrong.
Your child’s uncanny ability to suddenly turn off grief and act as though noth-
ing has happened isn’t a sign of a real problem in his or her grieving process.
Nor is it a sign that the child’s grieving is over. It’s most likely just a self-
protection device that enables the child to take a small vacation from the
uncertainty and sadness so that it doesn’t become too much to handle.
That’s not to say that children don’t have problems grieving. They do, espe-
cially in households where intense emotions aren’t readily displayed and
adults have trouble with their own grief from the same loss.
Here are some signs that your child’s grieving process may be hitting some
snags:
 He acts as though nothing out of the ordinary has happened (in other
words, he shows no signs of grieving).
 He becomes easily and often panicked.
 His schoolwork takes a real nosedive, he starts cutting classes, or he
even refuses to attend school.
 He has lots of trouble getting along with classmates and friends and
even gets into fights.
125
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

 He uses inappropriate language, commits delinquent acts, or is cruel to
animals.
 He talks about killing himself or threatens suicide.
 He becomes involved with alcohol or drugs.
If your child starts exhibiting one or more of these signs, you need to get out-
side help. Turn to a grief counselor, family counselor, or psychologist as long
as the professional has some experience in grieving and is trained in dealing
with children who have suffered trauma. You can find out more about finding
grief counselors and support groups in Chapter 14.
Helping grieving children deal with dreams and nightmares
Children quite commonly have trouble sleeping through the night after a
death occurs in the immediate family. They often no longer want to sleep
alone or are unable to sleep without a night light on.
Moreover, many children have vivid dreams about the deceased and/or
death. They may even have nightmares in which they, other surviving mem-
bers of the family, or classmates and friends are harmed or are no longer
secure.
In trying to help a child with problems sleeping, consider doing the following:
 Spend extra time putting your child to bed by reading his favorite non-
scary stories.
 Turn on a night light and play soft, soothing music in his room at 
bedtime.
 Limit his viewing of scary movies and violent computer games during
the day.
 Make sure that your child is as physically active as possible during 
the day.
When you’re dealing with a child who’s having dreams about the deceased,
don’t automatically assume that these are bad dreams or particularly fright-
ening to the child. They may be attempts to stay in contact with the lost
loved one (a very common occurrence among grieving people of all ages)
that the child actually finds quite comforting.
Be certain to discuss these dreams with your child to determine how he feels
about them. If the child is older, consider talking to him about what he thinks
these dreams mean — such as whether they represent an attempt by the
deceased to contact him or simply longing on the child’s part to be in 
contact with the deceased (or both).
126
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

When you’re dealing with a child who’s having repeated nightmares, discuss
the bad dreams with him. If he’s reluctant to discuss the nightmares with
you, seek out someone (perhaps a professional grief counselor) he feels com-
fortable talking to. Sometimes, simply talking about the dreams with some-
one the child trusts makes them less scary.
Some parents try to help their grieving children get over their bad dreams by
putting up dream catchers, either above the child’s bed or at the entrance to
the child’s room. If you do this, explain to the child that Native Americans
believe that the net of the dream catcher captures all the bad dreams that
might come to him, letting only the good dreams get through the spaces in
the net.
Working through regrieving the loss
A child is a person in development. As children reach milestones on their
way to adulthood — proms, graduations, weddings, the birth of the first
child, and so on — they’re often vividly reminded of the losses they experi-
enced as youths, and they relive the grief they suffered.
Regrieving a childhood loss is quite common, especially during significant
events at which the loved one’s absence is particularly conspicuous (for
example, a deceased father’s absence at a daughter’s wedding or a deceased
mother’s absence at the birth of a daughter’s first child).
Normally, the regrieving that an adult experiences isn’t nearly as intense and
long-lived as it was in childhood. Nevertheless, the pain and sorrow are just
as real, and many of the same emotions that the bereaved experienced as a
child (anxiety, insecurity, and the like) can resurface.
Keep in mind that regrieving a loss represents just another step in terms of
integrating the original loss into one’s life. If at all possible, the bereaved
should welcome this ensuing part of the grieving process that he began as a
youth as yet another way to remember and honor his loved one.
One of the most important and poignant milestones for a person who lost a
parent as a child is the birthday at which he reaches the same age that his
mother or father was when she or he died. The bereaved may find it hard to
believe that he’s made it to the age of his deceased parent. He also may ques-
tion whether he’ll live beyond that age or, if he’s the same gender as the
parent, how he’ll get by without any further model of motherhood or father-
hood to follow.
127
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

Adolescents and Grief
As you may recall, the teenage years are an awkward and turbulent time
when you seem to be caught in a nether region somewhere between child-
hood and adulthood. No longer wanting to be seen as a kid, you’re very
seldom considered an adult capable of making rational decisions. As the
parent of a grieving teenager, it’s important that you keep these feelings in
mind.
Adolescence is also the time when being liked by one’s peers and being
accepted by them is all important. Because the experience of a death and the
grieving that comes with it makes a teen different from his peers, a support
group with other teens who are also experiencing a profound loss may be
most beneficial.
Grieving a profound loss as an adolescent, always tricky at best, can be par-
ticularly difficult when any of the following conditions apply:
 The teen feels as though he must be a role model for his younger sib-
lings (the children in the home).
 The teen feels as though he needs to be stoic to protect the feelings of
other family members. (This is especially true when the deceased is one
of the parents and the teen feels as though he needs to shield the surviv-
ing parent.)
 The teen’s intensely sad emotions brought on by the grief get mixed up
and come out as anger and frustration (especially in emotionally cool
households).
 The teen’s relationship with the deceased was problematic and marred
by intense conflict.
 The teen is preoccupied with his mortality or immortality and starts
engaging in high-risk (perhaps death-defying) behaviors or even becomes
suicidal after the death.
The best way to help a grieving teenager cope with his feelings is to be
honest about your own feelings and provide as much honest information
about the death and the current situation as you can. Also, try emphasizing
the positive legacy of the lost loved one, and suggest creative ways in which
the teen can memorialize and honor the loved one (see Chapter 19 for ideas).

Resources for Guiding 
a Child through Grief
Children’s grieving is one area in which (thankfully) a great deal of research
has been done and in which there’s a great deal of interest. As a result, you
can find a lot of solid support for helping yourself and your children grieve
fully and successfully.
Books
The books on children’s grieving are numerous, so you shouldn’t have any
trouble finding the right book for you and your child’s situation. In this sec-
tion of recommended books, I divide the print resources into three cate-
gories: books for younger children, books for adolescents, and books for
parents and other caregivers who are dealing with grieving children.
Books for young children who are grieving
Many books are written for young children to help them understand death
and grieving. Some of these books are perfect for reading to children who
aren’t yet reading on their own. Many are well illustrated and worth reading
over and over again. My favorites include:
 Water Bugs and Dragonflies: Explaining Death to Young Children by
Doris Stickney (Pilgrim Press): This small paperback uses a story about
a water bug that turns into a dragonfly to help young readers under-
stand death and life after death. (For ages 3 to 8.)
 When Dinosaurs Die: A Guide to Understanding Death by Laurie
Krasny Brown (Little Brown & Co.): This book covers every aspect of death
from old age to suicide, so I recommend that you read the book before
you choose appropriate parts to read to your child. (For ages 4 to 8.)
 Badger’s Parting Gifts by Susan Varley (HarperTrophy): This book
covers the subject of remembering a lost loved one through the story of
a badger whose friends recall a special memory of him after his death.
(For ages 5 to 10.)
 When Someone Very Special Dies: Children Can Learn to Cope with
Grief by Marge Heegaard (Woodland Press): This workbook lets children
use artwork and journaling to express their grief. (For ages 6 to 12.)
 Saying Goodbye by Jim Boulden (Boulden Publishing): This workbook
has activities and a coloring book that enables children to understand
129
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

death and begin to deal with the feelings caused by grief. (For ages 
5 to 10.)
 Charlotte’s Web by E.B. White (HarperTrophy): This award-winning
story of a little girl, her piglet, and a spider illustrates the poignancy of
friendship and death. (For ages 7 to 10.)
Books for grieving adolescents
There are many good books on teenagers and grieving that you can turn to if
you’re a parent, friend, or caregiver of a grieving adolescent. Among my
favorite titles are:
 Fire in My Heart, Ice in My Veins: A Journal for Teenagers
Experiencing a Loss by Enid Samuel Traisman and Ben Seiff (Centering
Corporation): This workbook for teens enables them to journal and
write letters to their lost loved ones.
 Straight Talk about Death for Teenagers: How to Cope with Losing
Someone You Love by Earl A. Grollman (Beacon Press): This book con-
tains a wide array of advice for teens who have lost someone they love
as well as answers to the questions they’re most likely to have.
 Facing Change: Falling Apart and Coming Together Again in the
Teen Years by Donna B. O’Toole (Compassion Books): This book covers
typical losses that teens may face on their way to adulthood (death of a
classmate, sibling, parent, or close friend). The book’s full of suggestions
of coping strategies that teens can develop to get them through the
ensuing grief.
Books for adults with grieving children
The books in this section are written specifically for parents and caregivers
of grieving children. These books can give you clear information on how to
talk with children about death as well as guide and help them through their
grieving.
Among the best books in this category are:
 When Children Grieve: For Adults to Help Children Deal with Death,
Divorce, Pet Loss, Moving, and Other Losses by John W. James, Russell
Friedman, and Leslie Landon Matthews (Harper Collins Publishers): This
book can help you shepherd a grieving child through all sorts of losses
in addition to the death of a family member or friend.
 Talking About Death: A Dialogue between Parent and Child by Earl
A. Grollman (Beacon Press): This book is a classic not only for explain-
ing death to children but also for understanding children’s feelings
130
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

during the grieving process. Rabbi Grollman also includes information
on how children respond to particular kinds of deaths and a section on
how to seek professional grief help.
 Helping Teens Cope with Death by Dougy Center for Grieving Children
(Dougy Center): This practical guide to the kinds of responses that ado-
lescents normally have to loss has plenty of advice on how to help them
through their grieving.
 The Grieving Child: A Parent’s Guide by Helen Fitzgerald (Fireside):
This book provides easy-to-digest and useful information on how to
explain death to a child and deal with his emotional responses.
 Children and Grief: When a Parent Dies by J. William Worden (The
Guilford Press): This book is an excellent reference for supporting a
child who’s lost a parent. It also includes information on helping a child
who’s lost a sibling or suffered the loss of a parent through divorce.
Online resources
While not nearly as numerous as print resources, there are some very good
online resources that caregivers supporting bereaved children as well as the
grieving children themselves can turn to in their time of grief.
Among my favorite Web sites that provide information and resources for and
about grieving children are:
 The Dougy Center for Grieving Children and Families at www.dougy.
org: The center supports bereaved children and their family members,
and this Web site provides targeted information on grieving for children,
teens, and adults. (The center was founded in 1982 in tribute to Dougy
Turno, a young man who died at age 13 from an inoperable brain tumor
after writing to Dr. Kübler-Ross questioning people’s inability to speak
with him about his impending death.)
 Children’s Grief Education Association at www.childgrief.org: This
site contains pages specifically for grieving children and teens as well as
a page for military families and one on suicide, both of which give 800
numbers for crisis hotlines that you can use in an emergency.
 KIDSAID at www.kidsaid.com: This Web site operated by GriefNet
offers a safe place where grieving children can communicate with one
another and share their stories and their feelings about the losses they’ve
experienced.
131
Chapter 7: Children and Grief

 Highmark Caring Place at www.highmarkcaringplace.com: From the
home page, you can link to information specifically for grieving children,
grieving adults, and grieving families as well as information on the impact
of death and grief.
 Centering Corporation: Your Grief Resource Center at www.centering
corp.com: This online resource center contains category links for chil-
dren and grief and teen grief, among others. The great thing about these
links is that they take you to pages with listings of books specific to the
type of grief. Click on a book title to get a synopsis and order it online.

The Loss of Friends
In This Chapter
 Looking at the nature of friendship and the loss of close friends
 Experiencing a friend’s death at any age
 Overcoming the challenges of grieving a friend
 Finding more information on friend loss
I
n Chapter 5 on grieving the loss of brothers and sisters, I explain that grief
professionals generally consider sibling loss to be a kind of disenfran-
chised grief, meaning that society often overlooks the grief of surviving sib-
lings and therefore undervalues or trivializes their losses. Well, if that’s the
case, the loss of friends produces the kind of grief that, up to now, society
has never even bothered to recognize.
The death of a friend, however, is a profound, grievable loss. In the modern
world, nuclear families tend either to be spread hither and yon or fragmented
and dysfunctional beyond repair; as a result, friends often act as your surro-
gate family. Friends may accept, support, and love you in ways that your blood
relatives don’t. I guess that this is to be expected: After all, your friends are
the people who you choose rather than ones who fate chooses for you.
This chapter begins with a look at friends and all the various functions they
fulfill in your life. It then examines the impact of losing a good friend, first 
as a young person and then as an adult. I cover the particular difficulties of
grieving the loss of a friend before concluding with a few resources available
to help you heal this type of loss.
The Importance of Friends
Friends run the gamut from casual acquaintances with whom you get together
occasionally to lifelong buddies for whom you’d literally give anything you

had. When you describe a particular friend to other people, you invariably
add some sort of adjective that encapsulates the nature of the relationship,
such as “my new friend,” “childhood friend,” “good friend,” “best friend,” or
“close friend,” to name the most obvious.
Your friends, at least the ones you consider to be close friends, actually may
furnish you the greater part of the emotional support and love that you’d 
otherwise expect to get from either your family or your spouse. In an age
when adult family members often live in different cities, states, or countries
and when people often are between spouses or not in any kind of committed
romantic relationships, you probably rely upon your close friends to fill 
many of the significant support roles in your life.
Close friends not only provide you with much needed companionship but
also support and challenge you. These friends are the ones you can count on
to tell you their woes as well as listen to yours. They’re also the folks you can
be honest with when you believe they need to rethink a position or revisit a
particular viewpoint, and you expect them to do the same for you.
Good friends also may understand you better than your own family does
because they’re the ones with whom you share many interests and experi-
ences. They’re also the ones in whom you can confide all your triumphs and
joys along with your worries and aggravations.
In many ways, friends are an extension of family, creating your family of pref-
erence rather than a family of legal and genetic ties. Friends are often your
first line of support in life and are sometimes even more dependable than
your very own kin. In short, the importance of friends, especially given the
hurried pace and the complex nature of modern life, can’t be understated.
Exploring the Impact of Losing Friends
If close friends are such a vital part of your life, it stands to reason that the
loss of such friends can bring every bit as much grief as the loss of a family
member. The loss of close friends is definitely a profound loss that needs to
be grieved like any other, regardless of how indifferent society is about this
kind of loss (it’s that old issue of disenfranchised grief again).
Just as with the loss of siblings or any other family member, the impact of the
death of a friend depends to some extent upon the age at which you suffer
the loss. Young people who suffer the loss of a close friend may have less
chance of grieving if the loss isn’t publicly mourned through the school or a
local church. Older people who suffer the loss of a good friend may have less
134
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

of an opportunity to grieve that loss if they’re not also associated with mem-
bers of the deceased friend’s immediate family or part of a close-knit group of
friends for whom the loss is mutual.
Experiencing the death 
of a friend as a youth
Thankfully, most people seldom experience the death of the friends they
make as children (that is, the friends they grow up with). This doesn’t mean
that young people don’t suffer the loss of friends, though. Unfortunately, far
too many teenagers and college-age young people lose friends to illness, acci-
dents (teenagers and cars are often a deadly combination), drug use, or vio-
lence (including war).
If you experience such a tragic death, you may be aided by some sort of
public mourning that’s organized through your school or a local church.
Because it may be your first experience with profound loss and the grief that
accompanies it, public mourning provides you a way to memorialize your
friend as well as to express your deep feelings over the loss.
If you’re the parent or a friend of a young person who has lost a close friend,
be sure to reassure that person that his grief is natural and something that
honors both the lost friend and the friendship that they shared. If the friend
died as the result of suicide, be sure to discuss any feelings of guilt related 
to not having been able to recognize the signs and prevent the death. Also,
encourage the young person to find ways to express his grief for the lost
friend, maybe through attending the funeral or visiting the grave site, and
memorializing his friend, such as by writing about the nature of the friend-
ship or by putting together a memory book for his friend’s family.
Experiencing the death 
of a friend as an adult
Very few people make it through their adult years without experiencing the
loss of at least one good friend, if not more. The deaths of friends may be the
result of all the awful and tragic things that take young people (refer to the
preceding section), although illness tends to figure in the mix a bit more
prominently with age (too often in the form of a heart attack, stroke, or that
old killer, cancer). The death of a friend of the same or similar age as you may
be particularly difficult because it can bring up fears and issues that you
have about your own mortality.
135
Chapter 8: The Loss of Friends

In some cases, you may find yourself actively supporting your friend during
his illness. You may even go so far as to become a part-time caregiver in lieu
of family members who live too far away to be able to provide day-to-day
care. In such a case, you may suffer anticipatory grief (see Chapter 2) in 
addition to the grief that you suffer over the loss of your friend.
If you weren’t part of your friend’s support system during his final days, or if
the death occurred suddenly and unexpectedly, you have to deal with a cer-
tain amount of shock over the loss. If it has been some time since you visited
or talked with your friend and he was the picture of health and vitality at that
time, the shock of the loss and your feelings of regret that you never had the
chance to say goodbye are probably your paramount emotions (see Chapter 14
for hints on how to deal with these emotions).
If you’re close to any of the surviving members of your friend’s immediate
family or are part of a group of mutual friends, contact them immediately and
offer any support that you can. In offering support to the fellow mourners of
your close friend, you’ll undoubtedly receive a great deal of emotional sup-
port and validation for your grief. Reaching out to others affected by the loss
is an excellent way to avoid feeling disenfranchised when it comes to grieving
the loss of your friend.
Dealing with the Difficulties 
of Grieving a Friend
The difficulties normally associated with grieving the loss of a close friend
stem directly from society’s belief that only the members of the immediate
family (including spouses) constitute the rightful mourners and are therefore
deserving of the condolences and support (slim though they may be) that
society normally affords to those it considers bereaved.
Sometimes you’re left out
As I explain in Chapter 5 on the loss of siblings, not all immediate family
members feel equally included in the circle of rightful mourners. Siblings of
the deceased often feel undervalued as legitimate grievers and overlooked
when it comes to the condolences that other family members (parents of the
deceased, the spouse, and surviving children) receive. (They point to the
general lack of sympathy cards for surviving siblings in the Hallmark card
line as just one very obvious symptom of this disenfranchisement.)
136
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

Well, when compared to surviving friends (for whom no Hallmark sympathy
cards now exist or are likely to in the near future), siblings have it really good.
After all, no one would ever think of not informing brothers or sisters of the
death of their sibling or not inviting them to the funeral. (An exception would
be the direst of circumstances in which an insurmountable rift exists between
the surviving sibling and the other family members.)
Contrast this to the predicament of close friends who may not be informed of
the death at all. If you don’t find out about your friend’s death when it hap-
pens or shortly thereafter, you lose the opportunity to attend the funeral.
If you don’t find out about the death of a dear friend in time to attend the
public mourning services such as his wake or funeral, you’ll have to find a
way to privately mourn his passing. One good way to do this is by organizing
your own memorial celebration to honor and remember the life of your
deceased friend. This celebration can include as many of his other friends
whom you know and as many members of his family who wish to participate.
In planning this memorial celebration, you have a great opportunity to review
your friendship and all that it means to you. In inviting and involving the
other participants, you have a great opportunity to find out more information
about your friend’s passing and to discover ways you can help support the
others grieving this loss.
Participating in the family’s mourning
If you’re in close contact with the family of your deceased friend, you’re likely
to be invited to participate in the mourning. For example, the family may give
close male friends the opportunity to be pallbearers at the funeral if the
deceased didn’t have brothers or male cousins who can perform this task.
In addition, the family may give you the opportunity to speak about your
friend and the relationship you shared either at the funeral or at some type 
of memorial service held afterward.
Finding appropriate ways to support the immediate family of a dear friend
during and after his funeral can really help you in your own grieving as well
as eliminate the feelings of being left out. When you contact the family to
offer your condolences, be sure to ask how you can be of help. Before the
funeral, check to see whether you can help with any of the many details
related to the funeral service or any gathering planned afterward. After the
funeral, look for practical ways to help the family get on with their day-to-day
activities; for example, it may be helpful if you perform simple household
errands that need doing and send over a favorite prepared meal.
137
Chapter 8: The Loss of Friends

When you have to mourn on your own
If the family or the circumstances under which the funeral is conducted don’t
permit you to eulogize as a close friend of the deceased, you need to find
your own way of telling the stories and remembering your lost loved one.
One way to do this is for you to gather with other friends to hold your own
memorial service during which everyone has a chance to speak about the
deceased and their relationships with him. This memorial service can be con-
ducted both in a spirit of lightheartedness and seriousness and can do a lot
to help legitimize your grief and bring the surviving friends together. Check
out Chapter 14 for more on how to express your grief over the loss.
One of the trickier challenges associated with grieving a friend’s death is find-
ing ways to mourn the loss that don’t interfere with grieving or further the
pain of your friend’s family. Following are two possible scenarios:
 In cases where the family is dealing with the loss as best as can be
expected and the death has brought the family members closer together,
they may find some solace in the expressions of grief by their loved
one’s close friends.
 In the case where the family is having great trouble dealing with the loss
and the death has opened up old wounds and reactivated deep-rooted
feuds, the family may not welcome such expressions of grief, misinter-
preting them as outsiders’ attempts to upstage their rightful grief.
On the whole, bereaved friends still remain the proverbial fifth wheel when it
comes to grieving the loss of a close friend. The best advice I can give you is to
remain sensitive to the situation both in terms of your own pain and need to
grieve and in terms of the way in which you remain at the mercy of the immedi-
ate family’s wishes when it comes to being included in public mourning.
Resources for Healing the Loss of Friends
Print resources that focus on healing the loss of friends are downright 
paltry, and online resources on the topic are completely nonexistent (how’s
that for disenfranchised grief!). In a field of limited options, here are my 
recommendations:
 Grieving the Death of a Friend by Harold Ivan Smith (Augsburg
Fortress Publishers): This book acknowledges the death of a friend as a
significant loss and attempts to help you with the grief. Smith examines
this unique type of grief as a progression that begins with the building of
138
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

the friendship and ends with remembering the friend and friendship and
reconciling the loss in your life. The text is full of quotations — some
from the Bible and many from other authors who have written about
grief — that enhance the author’s description of the feelings you endure
as you deal with the passing, burying, and mourning of a good friend.
Two sections of this book are particularly noteworthy:
• Cherishing the Memory: This section is chockfull of suggestions on
how to honor and memorialize your deceased friend.
• The Naming of the Names: This section contains the text of a ritual
for remembering any loved one whom you’ve lost. This ritual is
perfect for memorializing your deceased friend in lieu of or in addi-
tion to a traditional funeral or memorial service.
 Friendgrief: An Absence Called Presence (Death, Value, and Meaning)
by Harold Ivan Smith (Baywood Publishing Company): This is Harold
Ivan Smith’s most complete book to date about grieving the loss of a
friend. In it, he covers all aspects of grieving the death of friends, includ-
ing lots of good advice on how to be supportive after the death as well
as how to honor the friendship as you grieve the loss.
 When Your Friend Dies by Harold Ivan Smith (Augsburg Fortress Pub-
lishers): This is Smith’s shortest and most recent book to date about
grieving the loss of a friend. In it, Smith introduces his concept of friend-
ship and “friendgrief” as he outlines the basic ways you can honor your
friendship by grieving the loss.
 When A Friend Dies: A Book for Teens About Grieving and Healing
by Marilyn E. Gootman and Pamela Espeland (Free Spirit Publishing):
This compact book addresses the subject of grieving the loss of a friend
directly to adolescents. The authors aim to help teens validate their 
typical responses to this type of loss, including guilt, anger, confusion,
fear, and numbness. This revised edition also addresses the subject of
losing a friend through violence. Each chapter addresses a particular
question and includes practical advice interspersed with quotes from
other bereaved teenagers as well as from famous writers and philosophers.
 Healing a Friend’s Grieving Heart by Alan D. Wolfelt (Companion):
This little gem of a book contains 100 suggestions of things that you can
do to help a friend who’s grieving the loss of a loved one. At the end of
each suggestion page is a Carpe Diem section that contains a related
idea of something else you can do. Although this book isn’t specifically
targeted to people grieving the loss of friends, I think many of the
author’s suggestions are quite apropos if you read them as things you
can do for yourself to help in grieving the loss of your friend.
139
Chapter 8: The Loss of Friends

In lieu of Web sites devoted to the loss of a friend, you have to make do with
Web sites for bereavement in general. See Chapter 22 for my top ten general
grieving Web sites. Also, you may want to check out Alan Wolfert’s Web site
for his Center for Loss and Life Transition, www.centerforloss.com. This
site offers information on other titles in the 100 Ideas book series and Dr.
Wolfelt’s workshops on grief as well as information on how to contact him 
for one-time or short-term counseling.

The Loss of Pets
In This Chapter
 Respecting the bond between humans and their pets
 Exploring the impact of losing a pet at different stages of your life
 Facing end-of-life decisions
 Grieving a pet publicly and privately
 Looking to additional resources for healing the loss of a pet
F
or some people, it’s a real shock to discover that the loss of a pet brings
on a grief every bit as deep and challenging as what they experience
after losing a close family member or a very dear “human” friend. In fact,
sometimes the grieving is even greater in the case of pets. But if you stop to
consider that most people consider their pets to be members of their families
and very dear friends, this fact doesn’t seem nearly so surprising.
Pet loss is the only profound loss that doesn’t deal with grieving the loss of
another human being. This chapter begins by examining some of the unique
characteristics of the relationships people build with pets. Then I turn to the
impact of losing a pet, first as a child and then as an adult.
The chapter also takes up the difficult topic of euthanizing pets (usually
called putting a pet down) and how this decision can add regrets that make
grieving your loss more painful and difficult. You discover the problems that
can arise when you openly grieve a pet but the people around you have little
understanding of pet grief and even less sympathy for it. The chapter con-
cludes with a listing of both print and online resources to turn to for help
dealing with the loss of your pet.

Always There for You
It’s very telling that if you have a pet these days, you’re much more likely to
be described as the pet’s “parent” or “guardian” than its “owner.” So too,
even though you technically own the pet (at least in the eyes of the law),
you’re said to have adopted the pet, just as you would adopt a human baby. I
think that this change in language mirrors a change in the type of relationship
people have with their pets. In the main, dogs and cats are companions
looked at as treasured members of the family. Fewer and fewer animals func-
tion solely as nonhuman helpers that work as some sort of guardian and
attendant.
Regardless of whether your pet works for you in some capacity or you feel 
as though you work for it, there’s no denying the depth of the bond that
grows between you and your pet. Many describe this relationship as unique
because the pet — be it a dog, cat, bird, reptile, snake, or other animal —
gives its love to its human unconditionally and completely (something you
don’t find too often in relationships with fellow humans).
The way I describe the relationship between pet and human is that it feels
like your pet is always there for you, giving you total devotion. And while
cynics may counter that pets have to behave in this manner in order to sur-
vive (how else are they going to get you to feed them and take care of them?),
I know that the kind of loyalty and love I get from a pet is quite unlike the love
I experience from any other source. In turn, the kind of love and caring that I
have for my pets is very different than what I have for other people to whom
I’m close; somehow the love feels purer and less complicated even if it’s not
necessarily any deeper.
Exploring the Impact of Losing a Pet
Dealing with the death of a pet is almost always difficult and challenging —
even if the death is anticipated and the pet has lived a long and happy life.
Others may not understand the intensity of your grief (especially if they
aren’t “pet people”). Nevertheless, your grief is a testament to the strength of
the bond you created with your animal and the breadth of the experiences
and love you shared.
Given the fact that the life spans of pets usually are much shorter than those
of humans, when you adopt a pet, you also sign on to be there at its death
and undergo whatever grieving the loss brings. In addition, in the event of a
serious injury or illness, you may be called upon to make a decision regarding
142
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

euthanizing your beloved pet — a difficult decision regardless of the circum-
stances that you never have to ponder when dealing with a human family
member who’s dying unless you’re put in the very difficult position of having
to decide whether or not to shut off life support in accordance with a loved
one’s wishes.
Just how difficult and challenging your grief is over the loss of a pet is a func-
tion of a couple of factors:
 Your age at the time you adopted the pet and at the time you lost the
pet, as well as the challenges you faced during the time you shared
together
 The circumstances surrounding the pet’s death: Was the death antici-
pated or sudden? Did it occur after a short or long life? Did you have to
decide whether or not to euthanize the pet?
I begin this section by looking at how age can influence the intensity of your
grief over the loss of a pet before exploring the issue of how having to make a
decision either to prolong or terminate the pet’s suffering can make grieving
the loss more difficult.
Experiencing the death of a pet as a child
As I point out in Chapter 7, how well children comprehend the death of any-
thing or anyone is a function of their maturity, which most often is a direct
function of their age.
It’s like losing a friend or even a sibling
For most children, the death of a beloved pet is the first profound loss that
they experience in life. Of course, if your child is too young to understand the
concept of death, he may simply think that his beloved cat or dog has gone
away for a very long time. If he’s old enough to understand death conceptu-
ally, the loss of his pet will be accompanied by feelings of confusion, anger,
and hurt — the same feelings that he’d manifest at the death of any other
family member.
Because children aren’t normally the primary caretakers of family pets (even
when the pets are nominally considered theirs), they’re likely to feel the loss
of a pet as one would feel the loss of a best friend rather than a family member.
In the case of an only child who loses a beloved pet, especially a dog with
whom he shared a lot of experiences, the death can feel more like losing a
sibling (see Chapter 5) than simply losing his very best, and perhaps only,
friend.
143
Chapter 9: The Loss of Pets

Helping your child grieve
As when your child is grieving the loss of a human family member or close
friend, it’s very important that you find ways to enable the child’s expression
of grief over the loss of a pet. One of the best ways is to enlist your child’s
help in creating rituals that commemorate the pet and the child’s relationship
with it. Ideas for rituals include
 Having your child officiate at the pet’s funeral in which both of you bury
the pet’s body (if it’s a small animal) in the backyard or spread the ashes
if the pet was cremated. If the pet’s remains aren’t available for this cere-
mony, you can help the child honor the passing by planting a tree or
flower in the garden and/or placing stones decorated with messages
and, perhaps, a picture of the pet alone or with the child.
 Helping your child create artwork that remembers the pet and depicts
its unique place in the child’s life
When helping a child grieve the loss of his pet, especially when that pet was
the first one of any real importance in his life, you need to be very mindful
not to rush the grieving process. Following are a few don’ts to steer clear of:
 Don’t try to mitigate the loss by prematurely suggesting that you get a
replacement for the pet. This well-meaning gesture can send the mes-
sage that the pet isn’t worthy of grieving.
 Don’t tell the child that he shouldn’t feel so bad about the loss of the
pet. Instead, reassure the child that his sad feelings are a natural way to
honor the love he has for the pet and that they’ll diminish in time.
 Don’t try to hide your sad feelings over the loss of the pet in an
attempt to spare the child. Masking your own emotions can send the
message that crying, pouting, and being confused about the death are
not okay.
Experiencing the death 
of a pet as an adult
It may surprise you to find out that, for an adult, the death of a beloved pet
can be not only bewildering but also downright devastating. In fact, some-
times adults take the death of a longtime pet companion a lot harder than
their children or than they would take the loss of some of their human family
members.
144
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

The reasons a pet’s death can be so overwhelming for you are often unam-
biguous. They can, however, include any and all of the following:
 You regarded the pet as a surrogate child, and the pet was your one true
loyal companion that you could look to for unconditional love.
 The pet represented the only constant during a time of particular stress
and change in your life.
The break in your routine of caring for your pet day in and day out and con-
stant reminders of the loss can all too easily lead to depression (see Chapter
11 for details on this stage and Chapter 12 for ideas on what to do about it).
Keep in mind that the best way to deal with a period of depression is to use 
it as time to actively grieve the loss. You can do this not only by expressing
your emotions — sadness, anger, and fear for the future (see Chapter 14) —
but also by reminiscing about the pet and reviewing what it meant to you and
what you shared together (see Chapter 19).
Pets as eternal children
At one time or another, friends and family accuse almost all people who are
really into their pets of treating them like children (and in some cases, of
treating their pets better than their human children). This idea may seem
over the top, but pets really are like small human children in their inability to
fend for themselves and their need for guidance due to an inability to under-
stand the consequences of their actions.
Pets differ from human children significantly in that they don’t grow out of
this type of dependence as they mature, and they mature and grow old and
die much faster than their human guardians. As a result, even if you don’t
actually see your cat or dog as any kind of substitute child, when you lose a
pet of many years, you suffer a loss somewhat similar to that of a parent
losing a small human child. In losing the animal, you lose the benefit of being
surrounded by this purity and innocence.
The losses of a pet and a human child are very different, however, in that the
pet has lived its life to its full potential (assuming that it’s lived a fairly normal
span of years) and the young child has not. When a young child dies, the par-
ents lose all the dreams they had for the child and are left to grieve not only
the child’s companionship but the child’s unrealized life. When a pet dies, the
pet parents likewise are left to grieve the pet’s companionship, but they can
take comfort from knowing that the pet lived a full and rewarding life (for
which they were responsible in no small part).
145
Chapter 9: The Loss of Pets

Pets as constant companions in an ever-changing life
As a pet parent, even if you clearly regard your pets as pets and not as any
kind of furry or feathered children, grieving the loss of a pet can still be diffi-
cult because of the type of constancy it represents in your life.
Because a pet is such a constant companion, its absence is immediately
apparent in your life and keenly felt every day after its passing (from the time
you get up until the time you go to bed and especially when you come home
from work). This loss also makes itself known in the rupture of your daily rou-
tine as you find yourself no longer having to do regular tasks such as feeding
your pet or, in the case of a dog, taking it out for an evening walk.
The great thing about pets is that they’re always happy to see you and always
want to spend time with you (something that’s not always the case with your
family and friends). Moreover, they want to cheer you when you’re down and
still love you just the same even when you’re on less than your best behavior.
This kind of loyalty and constant love, which is so important in everyday sit-
uations, can assume tremendous importance in your life when you’re under-
going any type of life change, especially the really stressful ones like moving,
ending a love relationship, or changing careers. Your pet can come to repre-
sent an emotional constant that’s very difficult to be without.
After you come through a major life change with your faithful pet by your side,
you naturally may identify the pet’s steadfast and unswerving love as a key
element in helping you making it through. You even may feel as though you
couldn’t have gotten through the change without the emotional support afforded
by your pet. If this is your experience, after your pet dies, you’re flooded not
only with the regrets associated with being separated from this loving support
but also with a nagging doubt about how you’ll get through future changes —
especially grieving your pet — without your pet to support you.
When you feel lost in the storm of such emotions, remember all the loyalty
and love your pet afforded you and try to derive whatever sustenance you
can from the strength of the unconditional love and support. You may realize
how well placed your pet’s confidence was in you and use this realization to
find the strength to carry on to another day.
Dealing with Regrets over 
End-of-Life Decisions
No regret can make your grief over your pet’s death more difficult than that
associated with euthanasia. The decision to have a veterinarian terminate the
146
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

suffering of a beloved pet is one of the most difficult that anyone can face; it’s
such an onerous decision that it commonly haunts both pet parents who have
refused it and pet parents who have authorized it, all for the best reasons.
Fortunately, when all medical options for treating an injury or illness are
exhausted, you have the option to terminate your pet’s suffering through
euthanasia. Unfortunately, it’s not always clear when all the medical options
are exhausted, and euthanasia is one of those actions that can’t be undone.
When confronted with the decision of whether or not to euthanize your pet,
it’s important that you’re able to see it as a way to end your pet’s suffering
rather than an act of giving up on your pet. If you’re not able to see it as a gift
of supreme love that you’re able to give your suffering pet — regardless of
how difficult and painful it is for you — then chances are good that you’ll 
end up seriously second-guessing your decision if you move forward with
euthanasia.
If you’re ever faced with having to make this very difficult end-of-life decision,
before giving your approval, be sure to ask your veterinarian all the ques-
tions you have about the chances of your pet’s survival and the quality of its
life if your pet does survive. Also seek out the opinion of a specialist or other
veterinarian to corroborate your doctor’s prognosis. That way, at least you’ll
know that you’ve based your final decision on the best information that was
available to you.
Many pet parents are bedeviled by regrets and guilt after euthanizing their
pets. You may find yourself asking the following questions:
 Were there other medical options I didn’t explore before opting for
euthanasia?
 Did I give the okay to euthanize too soon, not trusting in my pet’s ability
to recover and thus ending its life too soon?
 Did I wait too long before giving the okay to euthanize, thus making my
pet suffer needlessly?
 Did I give the okay to euthanize because I just couldn’t afford any more
expensive treatments?
 Did I delay giving the okay to euthanize for purely selfish reasons or was
there really a chance to save the pet?
Like all the coulda, woulda, and shoulda notions that you can come up with
while grieving the loss of a loved one, the ones in this list are predicated on
many factors that are well beyond your or anybody else’s knowing. And more
importantly, they all serve only to obscure the loving and caring that moti-
vated whatever decision you ultimately made at whatever time you made it.
147
Chapter 9: The Loss of Pets

Keep your focus on the fact that your pet is no longer suffering and is at peace.
That way, you don’t get lost in regret and can prepare to start the hard work
of grieving the loss.

out Senior Dogs For Dummies by Susan McCullough (Wiley).
Grieving a Pet Loss in an 
Unsympathetic World
The world is somewhat short on tolerance when it comes to human grieving,
so tolerance is in even shorter supply for those grieving their pets (at least
among those who don’t have pets as well as those who don’t see pets as
family members).
Overlook those who can’t understand
Realize that people who haven’t experienced a close relationship with a pet
just can’t begin to fathom your grief. All too often, they see caring for animals
simply as self-indulgent sentimentality on the part of the pet owner. In fact,
some of these people ridicule the bond between humans and their pets, con-
sidering it to be beneath the dignity of a human.
Don’t expect to turn to people who don’t comprehend the bond between
humans and their pets for any kind of understanding and sympathy for the
grief you’re suffering.
When you meet up with someone who has no patience for grieving the death
of pets, you’re best off not challenging his position or trying to change his
opinion. Obviously, he’s missed out on a lot of love and genuine feeling if he
never experienced a bond like you had with your pet and therefore doesn’t
have any idea of how much it hurts to lose it. In such a situation, concentrate
on taking care of yourself and safeguarding your feelings rather than wasting
energy confronting him on this issue and trying to change his mind.
Tell the story of your relationship
Although it’s important for all people to tell the story of the relationship and
love that exists between them and the lost loved one as part of their grieving
148
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

process, this exercise is doubly important for people grieving the loss of a
beloved pet. (The importance of sharing may be related to the problems of
grieving the loss of a pet in a particularly unsympathetic world.) Describing
the relationship with your pet along with its meaning and depth can be as
healing as outwardly expressing your sorrow over the loss.
If you don’t have friends and family who can empathize and are willing to
listen to your story, and if you find that journaling and scrapbooking (see
Chapter 14) aren’t enough, you definitely should seek out a pet grief support
group in your area. For ideas on how to find and get in touch with a grief sup-
port group or counselor, refer to the next section.
Resources for Healing Pet Loss
As I indicate earlier in this chapter, although you may encounter some folks
who just don’t understand your grief over the lost of a beloved pet, you’re
apt to find a whole bunch more who do, especially if you use the resources
that I list in this section. These resources include some very excellent and
easy-to-read books and Web sites frequented by caring people.
Books
Although they tend to be fairly short, books on pet grieving are filled with
great information that’s very much to the point. By and large, these books
rely upon the stories and anecdotes of pet parents to illustrate their points
about pet grief and recommendations of how best to process it. The following
are my favorite books on pet grieving:
 Grieving the Death of a Pet by Betty J. Carmack (Augsburg Books):
Betty Carmack’s gem on pet grieving loosely follows the famous verse
from Ecclesiastes 3:1–8 (“To everything there is a season . . .”) to present
the process of grieving a pet in five parts stretching from a time to love
to a time to heal. In between, she tackles the subjects of getting ready to
say goodbye, actually letting go, and then grieving the loss.
 Saying Good-Bye to the Pet You Love: A Complete Resource to Help
You Heal by Lorri A. Greene and Jacquelyn Landis (New Harbinger
Publications): This book on grieving the loss of a pet is wonderful
because of the range of its contents. It contains great information about
the bond between humans and their animals and insights on the grieving
process, but it also has exercises that prompt you to reflect upon and
write your feelings (something that many people find very healing).
149
Chapter 9: The Loss of Pets

 Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a
Pet by Gary Kowalski (New World Library): The Reverend Gary Kowalski
very sensitively explores and validates the bond between humans and
their animals. In addition to good information on pet grieving, Kowalski
includes some very touching poems. Kowalski also has written a book
on the spirituality of animals entitled The Souls of Animals.
 When Only the Love Remains: The Pain of Pet Loss by Emily Margaret
Stuparyk (Hushion House Publishing): This book consists of a collection
of inspiring poems about the pain of pet loss and the strength of the
human-animal connection. Stuparyk wrote the book after the death of
her beloved rabbit, Poochie.
 How to ROAR: Pet Loss Grief Recovery by Robin Jean Brown (Lulu
Press Inc.): Robin Brown’s book on pet loss and grief recovery is unique
not only in its insights into the pet grieving process but also because of
its workbook approach that encourages journaling as a way to work
through the heartache and grief associated with losing a beloved pet.
 Absent Friend: Coping with the Loss of a Treasured Pet by Laura Lee
and Martyn Lee (Ringpress Books): Coauthor Laura Lee has many years
of experience in bereavement counseling, and her husband and co-
author Martyn Lee is a veterinary surgeon. Together they created a 
great source book on the trauma of losing a beloved pet and grieving the
loss. This book has a great chapter on the subject of euthanasia as well
as one on the subject of finding an appropriate resting place for your
pet’s remains. It also examines the issue of whether surviving pets
grieve the loss of one another in a household.
Online resources
The online resources on pet grieving that I list in this section are among the
very best grief support sites you’ll find anywhere on the Web. The first two
sites contain important listings of pet grief support groups and counselors
arranged by state; use them to find understanding people with whom you can
share your loss. The last two sites in this list offer more-direct support: the
first in the form of pet memorials and the second in the form of a wonderful
audio book to which you can listen again and again.
 Pet Loss Support Page at www.pet-loss.net: This Web site contains a
state-by-state guide to pet grief support groups and counselors, a list of
books on pet grief, information on grieving the loss of a pet, and links to
various memorial Web sites.
150
Part I: Contemplating Grief 

 Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement at www.aplb.org: This site
is run by a Brooklyn-based nonprofit dedicated to helping people cope
with the loss of their pets. It contains a chat room as well as links to
approved pet grief counselors in a number of states.
 The Nikki Hospice Foundation for Pets at www.pethospice.org: This
site, run by the Nikki Hospice Foundation for Pets (NHFP), is unique in
its hospice support for people whose pets are facing the end of their
lives. NHFP can help you locate a veterinarian in your area who is willing
to give end-of-life care to terminally ill pets in the home and, many times,
euthanize them there, if and when that difficult decision is made. In addi-
tion, this Web site offers resources and support for pet parents who’ve
lost their loved ones.
 Rainbows Bridge at www.rainbowsbridge.com: At this virtual pet
memorial, you can commemorate your pet for an annual fee (a portion
of which is donated to various animal shelters across the United States)
as well as have your pet remembered at a weekly candle-lighting ceremony.
 Journey Through Pet Loss audiobook at www.petlossaudio.com:
This site contains information about and excerpts from Deborah
Antinori’s audiobook, Journey Through Pet Loss. This series of audio-
tapes addresses all aspects of pet loss and grieving. The information is a
blend of therapeutic help and the author’s own experiences with pet
loss, and the overall tone is quite sensitive and soothing.

T
he period following news of the death of a loved one often is a time not
just of shock but of personal crisis, when you feel that life has thrown
you into the deep end of the pool without any sort of life preserver. It’s also a
time when you can feel most alone — even if you’re surrounded by loving
and supporting friends and family.
The focus for this period in grieving is purely your survival. Initially, this
means finding ways to take care of yourself physically and emotionally as the
loss becomes real and unavoidable. Ultimately, your survival means finding
ways to begin the grieving process and start the long road to integrating the
loss into the rest of your life.
Think of this chapter as your immediate survival guide for enduring the
shock you get when you first find out about the death of a loved one as well
as for riding the roller coaster of emotions that follow this terrible news. The
ideas and suggestions that you find in this chapter are geared to these
aspects of the initial stage of grieving.

Handling the News
The most common reaction to the news of the death of a loved one (even if
the death has been anticipated for some time and you actually witness it) is
disbelief! The inability to believe that someone you care so much about and
who plays such a vital part in your life is now lost to you forever is somehow
just too much to take in and initially accept as true.
This initial numbness and inability to accept the loss slowly wear off as your
head’s no longer able to deny the truth that your heart knows. This period of
initial loss acceptance varies widely according to the person and the type of
loss he’s suffered. Sometimes, sudden losses take more time for certain
people to acknowledge than the anticipated ones. And for other people,
anticipated losses can take just as much time to feel real as ones that folks
never saw coming.
Initially disbelieving the loss
Although no one actually knows why disbelief is such a common initial reac-
tion to the death of a loved one, experts in death and dying as well as psy-
chologists who specialize in this area are pretty much in agreement that it’s a
normal reaction (and perhaps even some sort of survival mechanism). They
also agree that disbelief in no way signifies any sort of leave-taking from real-
ity that you need to be concerned about.
Not surprisingly, while your head may be denying the reality of the death,
your heart may be suddenly and immediately overwhelmed with emotion,
struck with the enormity of the loss and in fear that the news is true. As a
result, although you can find yourself completely distraught and expressing
the most intense emotion at hearing of the death or even witnessing it, you
still may be in a state of mental uncertainty.
Slowly accepting the loss as real
Note that the initial disconnect between the head’s incredulity and the
heart’s sorrow can sometimes survive the loved one’s funeral, even if the
interment of the body is part of the ceremony. However, the disconnect usu-
ally starts to lessen for most folks in a fairly short time period (within weeks
after the death, in most cases).
156
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Slowly but surely, the hope that the loved one will suddenly show up on your
doorstep fades as the reality of the loss becomes more and more real. As the
death becomes more real for you, it’s not uncommon for you to feel as though
you’ve been in contact with the deceased. (This feeling is particularly common
for surviving spouses.) This contact may come in the form of an intensely
real nighttime dream in which you feel as though you’re gently caressed or
touched, or it may be in the form of some sort of daydream-type vision. No
matter how or when it comes, this event often signals an acceptance of the
reality of the death and, along with it, the onset of grieving over the loss.
Surviving the Grip of New Grief
When you first start grieving a profound loss, about the only thing you can
focus on is the loss itself, and about the only thing you can do about it is just
try to hang on and survive. Seeing as you’ve just received a major blow to
your soul, you really need to concentrate your energy on taking care of your-
self both physically and emotionally. (This advice goes double when you’re
responsible for taking care of others such as children — always remember
the instruction from airline flight attendants to put your oxygen mask on first
before you assist others in putting on theirs.)
While attempting to take care of yourself in this survival mode, you may have
to deal with periods of extreme emotional turmoil as well as bouts of emo-
tional deadness and depression. You may have trouble sleeping and eating
along with concentrating and remembering things. (At times, you may feel
like you’ve taken on some sort of senility as part of your grieving process.)
Above all, you may feel as though you’re surely going crazy. That’s one of the
most common worries voiced by those suffering acute grief as well as one of
the most unfounded.
It’s at times like this that you need to take each day one at a time and break 
it down into smaller parts that you feel capable of dealing with at the time.
Moments may be as brief as the next minute or even the next few seconds —
that’s fine provided that you can find the strength to get through those
moments.
Dealing with overwhelming emotions
From the moment you get the sad news, you begin to suffer the emotions that
come from that loss. This is the time when you’re especially vulnerable to
being overwhelmed by your emotions. These emotions can be contradictory
157
Chapter 10: Doing Your Own Grief Crisis Management

depending upon the stage of grief you happen to phase into (see Chapter 11
for more on typical phases of grief and the emotions that normally accom-
pany them). Your emotions are, however, almost always intense and often too
powerful to resist.
Don’t fight them
You feel the most out of control when you’re newly bereaved. You may feel as
though once you start expressing an emotion, you’ll never stop (especially if
you express your sadness through crying or your frustration through anger).
This impression that you’re about to lose all control and may not be able to
regain it may make you fear the emotions and try to resist expressing them.
Many times, this resistance is as futile as the folks on Star Trek: The Next
Generation trying to resist their half-machine collective enemy, the Borg. You
need to understand that this fear that once you start expressing an extreme
emotion you’ll never be able to stop is unfounded. It’s probably just an indi-
cator of how intense the emotions are and how much you need to express
them.
Get to a safe place
To deal with emotional onslaughts, it’s critical that you be in a safe place at
the time they come over you. For example, if you’re driving down the high-
way and you feel a crying jag suddenly coming on, you need to pull over as
the waterworks start. Likewise, if you feel a rage boiling up inside you, try to
maintain your cool until you get yourself into a space where you can fume
and rant without alarming others around you. (Even better, find a place where
you can even tear up a few things or punch a few pillows without any pos-
sibility of injury either to yourself or anybody else.)
As for the concern that you’ll never be able to stop crying, screaming, or
giving flight to whatever emotions you need to get out, you needn’t have any
worries on this score. At some point in the emotional purge, probably right
after exhaustion sets in, you’ll run out of tears, cries, screams, wails, cuss-
words, and whatever else, and then just as suddenly as the onslaught began,
it will end.
Get some rest
After an emotional onslaught ends, you’ll probably be as limp as a washrag
and feel pretty drained. This is a perfect time to take a break from grieving
and set about restoring yourself both physically and emotionally. If you can
manage it, take a short nap. At a very minimum, give yourself at least a few
minutes (or better yet, 15 minutes) of quiet time before trying to undertake
anything.
158
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Dealing with your initial numbness
Not all newly bereaved people experience onslaughts of intense emotion that
they just have to let out. And even those who do may find that there are times
when they not only don’t feel any strong emotions but also don’t seem to feel
anything. Emotional numbness can be the result of physical and mental exhaus-
tion from the events surrounding the death and funeral just as well as the result
of depression over the recent loss.
Regardless of their origin, periods of emotional numbness aren’t a sign that
you’re going crazy. The only time you should be the least bit concerned
about this lack of feeling is if it’s the only state that ever manifests itself after
your loss.
If you find yourself pretty much emotionally numb all the time and unable to
feel anything for some time after your loss, don’t ignore this condition indefi-
nitely. It could be a sign that you’re having real trouble grieving the loss and
are in danger of shutting down the entire process. I urge you to seek out a
grief counselor (see Chapter 14) to discuss your numbness in light of your
loss and get ideas of what you can do to safeguard yourself while at the same
time start grieving the loss.
Taking Good Care of Yourself
It almost goes without saying that the first thing you need to do at the 
outset of grieving the loss of a loved one is take care of yourself physically
159
Chapter 10: Doing Your Own Grief Crisis Management
Depression and its relation to grieving
Depression is a term that has both a clinical and
nonclinical usage in everyday language.
Clinically, depression describes a psychological
condition marked by a group of symptoms that
include diminished motivation, interest, and
energy levels, and dejected moods, all of which
disrupt a person’s ability to function normally.
Nonclinically, depression generally refers to the
emotional state in which you feel sad or low and
often suffer a loss of motivation and physical
energy.
As far as depression and grief go, most death
professionals agree that the majority of
bereaved people suffer symptoms of clinical
and nonclinical depression without being offi-
cially depressed in the sense of requiring med-
ical help (either in the form of psychological
counseling or antidepressant medication).
Fortunately, most bereaved people manifest the
symptoms of depression only while they’re
actively grieving their losses, and their symp-
toms go away naturally afterward.

and emotionally. Although this advice may sound ridiculously self-evident,
it’s the one thing that a newly bereaved person can easily forget to do.
Forgetting to care for yourself is quite understandable given the stress caused
by your loss (even if you anticipated it) and the fact that immediately after-
ward your attention is normally anywhere except on your needs. Add to this
the fact that newly bereaved people frequently lose their appetite for food
and have trouble sleeping soundly and through the night, and you have a per-
fect recipe for making yourself ill and making your grieving even harder than
it has to be.
Eating right
To avoid getting ill while you’re grieving and to maintain the strength you
need to get through its ups and downs, you may need to consciously adopt
an attitude that makes eating regularly a priority. You have to resist the urge
to ignore food even if you don’t have much of an appetite, aren’t able to eat
much at any sitting, and don’t much enjoy the taste of the food.
Consciously watch the type of food you eat. You may find yourself reaching
for comfort food with loads of sugar and carbohydrates. Sugar is just about
the last thing you need during this time because it can depress your mood as
well as interrupt your sleep. Regulate your sugar intake carefully, and make it
a point to eat healthier.
Because you may lack the motivation to cook and prepare healthy meals
during your grieving process, create a list of various delis and other restau-
rants that can supply you with food to go (assuming that you won’t be in the
mood to go out to eat very often). That way you can rely upon these resources
for good and healthy takeout food during this time and thus avoid frequent
stops at all those fast-food chains in your area.
Getting the sleep you need
Eating regular and healthy meals while you’re actively grieving a loss is only
one part of the battle for taking good care of your physical needs. In addition,
you need to make sure that you get enough sleep, which is often more diffi-
cult than it sounds.
Nights are particularly hard for many newly bereaved people to get through.
You may have a really tough time falling asleep because your mind’s racing
and you can’t stop thinking about the loss you’ve just suffered and replaying
160
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

different what-if scenarios by which it could have been avoided. And even if
you do get to sleep without too much fuss, you may have trouble sleeping
soundly through the night.
Short of seeing your physician and getting a prescription for sleeping pills or
other types of sedatives, the most effective way to combat sleep disruptions
is to engage in physical activity during the day so that your body is physi-
cally tired at night. Then, to stop your mind from racing and to resolve other
problems you have falling asleep, try some meditation techniques that involve
concentrating on your breathing (see the next section for more on mental
alertness and focus).
To help you get the rest you need at night, it’s often a very good idea to 
make sure that you get regular physical exercise during the day — and even
increase your levels, if you’re a regular exercise enthusiast. You’d be sur-
prised at how much the need for physical rest can help calm the troubled
mind even when dealing with such intense emotions. In Chapter 15, you can
find information about using physical exercise to help you get through the
grieving process.
Especially at the onset of the loss and during the first few weeks following,
you may find that a prescription sleep aid or sedative is your only option for
dealing with your stress-related sleep problems. When this is the case, be
very careful not to abuse these pharmaceuticals; many of them are habit
forming, and you may find yourself particularly vulnerable to dependence
during this time of great emotional upheaval and sorrow (check out the sec-
tion “Avoiding the tendency to drown your sorrows,” later in this chapter).
Staying mentally alert and present
As if suffering loss of appetite and trouble sleeping weren’t enough, many
newly bereaved people also find that they have trouble concentrating and
staying focused on whatever’s before them. This is the case even when the
folks had no such problems concentrating on things prior to the loss and
were generally considered sharp as tacks.
Some of this lack of mental acuity may be related to your improper nutrition
and sleep deprivation, but you may experience difficulty concentrating even
if you’re eating right and sleeping well. In fact, the problems with concentra-
tion that commonly strike newly bereaved people more likely relate to the
person’s overriding need to process the loss and make some kind of sense of
it than to any other factor.
161
Chapter 10: Doing Your Own Grief Crisis Management

The good news is that this kind of difficulty concentrating and staying focused
on a topic or task is a temporary condition for almost everyone. Usually, your
ability to concentrate returns some time after you begin actively doing the
grieving work.
Obviously, this reassurance is of little comfort when you have tasks you have
to get done — related to your job or the estate of the deceased, for example —
and you just can’t focus. About the only thing you can do in this kind of situa-
tion is cut yourself some slack.
 Admit to yourself that, for right now, you’re just not as sharp as usual.
 Let others know about your current (temporary) situation, and get them
to help you complete the job at hand.
In the long run, the key to regaining your powers of concentration is to pay
proper attention to the enormous distraction that’s responsible for throwing
them off so badly — namely, your grief over the recent loss of your loved
one. You can facilitate this process by giving grieving your full attention
whenever you can after you’ve taken proper care of your physical needs and
fulfilled the unavoidable demands of your daily life. See the section “Giving
Yourself Permission to Grieve,” later in this chapter, for more on this subject.
Avoiding the tendency 
to drown your sorrows
The pain caused by the loss of a loved one can never be underestimated. As I
mention earlier in this chapter, when first confronted by a profound loss, you
basically go into shock, and as a result, you walk through your everyday
activities in a kind of zombie mode.
During this period, you may find yourself trying to drown your sorrows
(which are now extensive) with whatever “mother’s little helpers” you nor-
mally turn to in order to take the edge off your anxiety. These helpers can be
anything from junk food to shopping, although more times than not, they’re
alcohol and prescription drugs (often in the form of sleep aids and sedatives).
Be aware that acute grief makes you particularly susceptible to developing
dependencies on all anxiety-reducing and pain-relieving substances and activ-
ities. This situation is somewhat analogous to the danger of dependency
when you take strong pain relievers after a major operation or physical
injury. However, you may be even more susceptible when grieving because
this condition often brings up overpoweringly painful emotions that are
harder to deal with and block than physical pain.
162
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

The bottom line is that, as part of taking good care of yourself during this
time of acute anxiety, you have to balance your need for lessening the pain
against your personal vulnerability to dependence on whatever actually
lessens the pain. Some people have more-addictive personalities than others
(and you probably already know your strengths and limitations in this arena),
and these people have to be extracautious about using outside means to de-
stress and lessen the pain. Because grieving is such a stressful process, it’s
also the time to err on the conservative side when it comes to masking or
dulling the sorrow you’re undergoing.
Don’t mistakenly believe that you’re going to find some great release from the
pain of grieving through the use of drugs or alcohol. Instead, more often than
not, these substances end up intensifying your sorrow instead of lessening it
in any way. And even when you take these kinds of substances to excess and
are able to block out all memory of the grief for a bit, the hurt only comes
back worse afterward. This can easily lead to a cycle of addiction in which
you have to keep medicating yourself more and more in a losing battle to
block out the pain.
Taking on only one thing at a time
Strangely enough, the outset of grieving is a time when people are likely to
take on too much despite the fact that it’s also a time that they have the most
trouble concentrating. This situation normally results from the demands
placed on you to make funeral arrangements and deal with matters related to
the death and estate (in which case, you want to delegate as much responsi-
bility to trusted family and friends as you possibly can). But it also can result
from the desire to stay busy so that you don’t have to think about your pre-
sent loss and suffer the pain it causes.
The problem with taking on too many things to avoid the pain (see Chapter
12 for more on this) is that it exacerbates your weakened condition. You’re
probably already at risk for getting sick from the general stress and fatigue
brought on by loss. You’re also too scattered to be at top efficiency in accom-
plishing the things on your to-do list.
Therefore, taking on just one task at a time is probably all you can manage
safely. You may even find that it takes you longer and requires more energy
than usual to accomplish just one task. This is perfectly natural considering
the circumstances, and this is the time to be gentle with yourself and give
yourself as much space as you need to deal with all the aspects of grief
you’re experiencing.
163
Chapter 10: Doing Your Own Grief Crisis Management

Giving Yourself Permission to Grieve
I believe that one of the most important things you can do for yourself at the
outset of a profound loss is to give yourself permission to grieve the loss
you’ve just suffered. At first, this whole idea may sound really strange.
However, the reasoning here is twofold:
 You can’t rely upon anyone else to give you all the time and space you
need to grieve the loss and integrate it into your life.
 You’re very well served by making an internal agreement with yourself
by which you unequivocally acknowledge your need to honor your rela-
tionship with your loved one by grieving its loss fully and completely.
Needless to say, you almost never have any clear idea of how much time and
space you’re going to need to grieve a particular loss. What you can count
on, however, is that no matter how much time you eventually take, it will be
more time than your friends and co-workers and even some of your family
members think you should have spent and, frequently, more time than they
can comfortably afford you.
In giving yourself permission to grieve your loss, you also
 Honor the relationship you had with your loved one
 Acknowledge that your feelings of sorrow over the loss are valid
 Recognize that the grieving of this loss is now of paramount importance
in your life
No matter how difficult and painful the process, by giving yourself permis-
sion to grieve, you actually begin the work of grieving, evaluating the impor-
tance of the person lost and the nature of the relationship you shared. In so
doing, you also begin the process of finding out how the best qualities of
both (the deceased and your relationship) can continue to live in you and
influence the rest of your life.
I’m not suggesting that giving yourself the necessary latitude to grieve is
always easy. You may come upon times when the sorrow is almost too much
to bear and all you want to do is shut down all your feelings, but you also
may feel quite a bit of pressure from the outside world to shut the grieving
process down prematurely.
164
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Staying in touch with your 
feelings for the duration
Staying in touch with your feelings all the while you grieve can prove more
difficult than you expect. Because so many of the emotions associated with
your loss are negative and overwhelming, you may find yourself doing every-
thing in your power to shut them out. To protect yourself and facilitate this
survival mechanism, you even may end up shutting down all your feelings,
thereby running the risk of putting the kibosh on the entire grieving process.
Keep in mind that when you shut down emotionally and hold back the griev-
ing process, you feel more wretched than if you were readily and openly
expressing all your emotions. Feeling dead inside really isn’t that much better
than feeling all your sadness and anger.
In fact, because sadness and anger (and all the other emotions that may
come up) are testaments to the bond you shared with your loved one, one
could easily argue that the grief you suffer outwardly is not in vain: Even
though you may consider the emotions negative, they serve the very positive
purpose of helping you remember the loved one and value the relationship
you had with each other. Remembering and valuing ultimately enables you to
incorporate the best qualities into your life from both the person and your
connection with him.
It’s not possible to grieve a loss without feeling the grief that comes from it.
And although grief work is by no means wholly emotional, a good share of it
is, and if you shut down your feelings, you can’t know when the bulk of the
work is done and you’ve reached some sort of peace with the loss. Also,
don’t forget that you don’t have to grieve 24/7 to get the job done. You will
often need respite from the grief, whether you get it by taking a walk in the
park, listening to some soothing music, or renting a dumb movie.
Taking time to grieve
In Chapter 1, I relate how modern society seems to be in such a rush to get
everything over and done with that it has limited tolerance for grieving. Many
people (and you may be one of them, especially if this is the first major loss
you’ve suffered) think that grieving is (or should be) a very short and sweet
process.
When your grieving doesn’t prove so short-lived, you may end up feeling
pressured by people around you to get the sorrow over with and move on
165
Chapter 10: Doing Your Own Grief Crisis Management

well before you’re ready. Even if this pressure isn’t evident, you’ll probably
find that taking care of your economic needs and maintaining your other reg-
ular duties don’t leave you all that much time and energy to devote to grieving.
The truth is that many people receive minimal leave from work after a death
in the family and often find themselves busier than ever after the event (espe-
cially with estate-related matters with which they’re usually totally unfamil-
iar). Although in an ideal world you would get all the time you need to work
through your loss, the fact is that you’ll probably have to strike a balance
between the following:
 The time you must devote to all the practical obligations in your life
 The time you need to devote to grieving your loss (usually uninterrupted
time when you can be completely alone)
Note that some folks benefit by getting back into the routine of work as soon
as possible and others do not. If you’re in the latter category and don’t have
any more bereavement leave, consider taking some extra days off before
returning to work (assuming, of course, that you have some vacation or 
other leave that you can use or can afford the days off without pay).
If you’re finding it difficult to get the time you need to grieve, you may have
to set aside a particular hour in your daily schedule when you can count on
uninterrupted time all to yourself. Although the idea of doing your grieving at
a particular time of the day may strike you as really odd at first, you may find
that this system not only allows you adequate time to express your emotions
and concentrate solely on your loss but also enables you to function better in
the world and perform the duties you can’t escape.
Whatever you have to do to arrange your life so that you have ample time to
grieve your loss, in the long run you’ll probably find that this is time well
spent. By taking time to grieve your loss when it’s new, you may even speed
up the process of integrating the loss into your life and thereby actually
reduce the amount of anguish you have to endure.
Forgiving Yourself and Everyone Else
Seeing that a great many losses are accompanied by feelings of regret and
sometimes downright guilt, forgiveness can play a big part in grieving.
Forgiveness either jump-starts the grieving process when you’re having trou-
ble getting in touch with your sorrow or gets the process back on track if
you’ve shut down your feelings (refer to the earlier section “Staying in touch
with your feelings for the duration”).
166
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

You may feel guilty about any number of things related to the loss of your
loved one. Most often, guilt centers on things you either did to or didn’t do
for your loved one before he died as well as things that your loved one did to
you or didn’t do for you prior to his death. In short, the guilt stems from the
things that you may consider to be weaknesses in the relationship, either on
your part or the part of your loved one.
Forgiving yourself
Forgiveness when grieving can be tricky because often it involves forgiving
yourself for not doing the things you imagine could have, would have, and
should have prevented the loss of the loved one in the first place. It can even
include having to forgive yourself for blaming your loved one for dying and
leaving you with all this grief to deal with.
Because many people have more trouble forgiving themselves than they do
other people, giving up all the regrets that you envision would have changed
fate can be particularly hard to do. For some, giving up on ruminating over
the things they feel responsible for and believe they could have changed is
tantamount to making the loss real in their lives, something they’re not yet
prepared to do.
Forgiving others
Needless to say, some situations require forgiveness not for yourself but for
others whom you hold responsible in the loss. The other may not be another
person but rather God, the cosmos, or whatever you feel is ultimately respon-
sible for the way things turned out.
This particular kind of forgiveness is tricky because it requires you to modify
not just your relationship to another person but your entire relationship with
the cosmos and your understanding of its justice, something that’s hard
enough to accomplish under ordinary circumstances and nearly impossible
under the weight of a profound personal loss.
Trying to forgive God for a world in which you have to endure the pain of losing
a loved one — especially under particularly traumatic circumstances — is
often work best left until near the end of your grieving process. Waiting gives
you a chance to really accept the loss as well as affords you the opportunity
to express and work through the major part of your disappointment in the
workings of the world and its creator. Moreover, as you come to the end of
the grieving process, you usually feel a renewed connection to the lost loved
one, which may mitigate your need to forgive the Almighty.
167
Chapter 10: Doing Your Own Grief Crisis Management

At whatever point you’re able to free yourself from the regrets surrounding
the loss, you immediately assume a new phase in grieving that loss. As your
concentration moves away from culpability for the loss, it moves toward
appreciation of the person you’ve lost and the relationship you shared. And
it’s here that you do the work of incorporating the loss into your life.
Knowing When You Need to Share 
and When You Need to Be Alone
Although grieving is obviously something that you can only do for yourself,
you don’t have to go through the process all alone. In fact, you shouldn’t
even attempt to do so. It’s quite common for newly bereaved people to vacil-
late between wanting to be left alone in their grief and wanting someone
there with whom they can share their sorrow.
Although only you can be the judge of when you really need time to yourself
and when you need to share your feelings with someone, be aware that open-
ing up to others can be one of the most beneficial and therapeutic ways of
working through your grief (see Chapter 14 for more on how this can work).
Companionship versus solitude: 
Either is okay
Some folks in the first stages of grieving really need constant companionship
and actually are hesitant to be alone in their grief. (This is often the case with
people who’ve just lost a life partner.)
168
Part II: Experiencing Grief 
Seeing forgiveness as a release, not a pardon
When most people think of forgiveness, they
naturally think of it in the sense of pardoning a
guilty party for his offenses, as when you forgive
a person who wrongs you. Such forgiveness is
great when you can manage it because it can
enable you to repair the friendship or relation-
ship and move on.
When forgiveness is related to the death of a
loved one, however, I think it makes more sense
to think of it in the sense of a release than of a
pardon. By releasing the regrets you have in
relation to the loss, you free yourself up to
grieve the loss without the burden of whether or
not you’re also ready to pardon the responsible
parties.

Others shun interaction with others and crave time and space all to them-
selves in order to sort things out. (This is often the case with parents who’ve
just lost children.)
It really doesn’t matter where you fall along this spectrum. The important
thing is that you recognize when you can benefit from sharing with others
and when you can’t. And when you feel like you need to share, it’s also impor-
tant that you have access to people who can support you in your grief and
don’t mind listening to your feelings.
Reach out when you’re ready
Right after experiencing a profound loss, it’s quite natural to feel more alone
than ever before (see Chapter 14). These feelings of being isolated and alone
can add to the burden of trying to handle the overwhelming emotions that
come with the loss. During this grieving period, you need to find the courage
to reach out to people who can support you, sometimes by listening to you
or just by being there with you.
If you don’t have friends and family members who can be there for you when
you need to share feelings, consider turning to grief support counselors in
your area. Although you may find the prospect of reaching out to total
strangers intimidating at first, it’s well worth the risk. Keep in mind that these
people not only are trained to support those in acute grief but also really
want to help the bereaved in any way they can. Turn to Chapter 14 for hints
on locating and contacting grief counselors in your local area.
If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t readily share your feelings with
others, you may find yourself naturally holding back from reaching out to
others during your initial stages of grieving. The danger here is that you run
the risk of making your grieving process a great deal more complex and diffi-
cult than it has to be. If you’re having trouble getting beyond your feelings of
anger and regret regarding the loss or expressing your feelings of apprecia-
tion for the one you’ve lost and the relationship you shared, it may be a sign
that you’re in trouble and that the tactic of keeping your feelings to yourself
is not working for you. In such a case, you need to push yourself to seek out
others who can support you and listen to your feelings.

Process of Grief

S
ometimes people liken grief to a physical injury that must heal, which
means that the process of grieving compares to the healing process that
takes place over time as an injury mends. Some people, however, aren’t par-
ticularly satisfied with that analogy and believe that it demeans grief. Moreover,
they don’t feel that the grieving process can be equated with healing because
a grieving person isn’t unwell; rather, he’s sad, and therefore his grief isn’t in
need of any type of a cure.
To help their patients understand and work through their grief, many noted
grief professionals have developed useful models with milestones or tasks
that they feel are normally part of this “healing” process. In this chapter, I
present three of these grief models in most basic outline form. I present their
information with an eye toward ways you may use their particular stages,
tasks, and phases as a kind of map to help you navigate your way through
your own personal grieving process. Then I use their particular steps as 
stepping-off points to give you my own suggestions on ways that they may
guide you more effectively.
Just don’t forget that the models I discuss in this chapter, with their various
stages of loss and tasks and phases of grieving, do not describe sequential
steps in a series that you will or must follow to get through grieving. They’re
merely signposts of phases that you may or may not encounter in your per-
sonal grieving process (or may even encounter more than once). Moreover,

although I present these stages and tasks consecutively, you may not encounter
or have to face them in the same order. There’s absolutely nothing wrong
with you or your grieving if you don’t do them in the prescribed order or
don’t do each one.
The Five Stages of Loss
Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in the field of death and dying.
In her seminal work, On Death and Dying (Scribner), published in 1969, Dr.
Kübler-Ross outlined what she typically witnessed in her clinical practice as
the five stages of dying. In her final work, On Grief and Grieving (Scribner),
published after her death in 2004, Dr. Kübler-Ross and her coauthor, David
Kessler, adapted these five, now classic, stages of dying to grieving.
The classic Five Stages of Dying and Loss as outlined by Dr. Kübler-Ross are:
1. Denial: In dying, denial refers to a basic inability to deal with the reality
of the impending death. In grieving, denial refers to an inability to
believe that the death of a loved one has really happened.
2. Anger: In dying, this anger is all about the impending death. In grieving,
this anger refers exclusively to loss of a love one. In both cases, this
anger can be directed either inwardly at oneself or outwardly toward
others.
3. Bargaining: In dying, bargaining refers to making deals (usually with
God or the universe) that will spare a loved one his impending demise.
In grieving, bargaining refers instead to feelings of regret expressed by
“what if” and “if only” scenarios in which the death of a loved one could
have been prevented.
4. Depression: In dying and grieving, depression refers to being over-
whelmed by the reality of the situation as well as the resulting with-
drawal and shutting down (this can be on both a physical and
psychological level).
5. Acceptance: In dying, acceptance refers to acknowledging the reality of
the impending death. In grieving, acceptance refers to acknowledging
the loss and its repercussions in one’s life. Note that in neither situation
does acceptance necessarily mean that one is okay with this reality.
Given the widespread familiarity that health professionals and laymen alike
have with these five stages as they concern the process of dying, I think it’s
useful to compare Kübler-Ross’s Five Stages of Dying to her Five Stages of
Loss. Therefore, the following five sections describe the meaning of each of
these stages, first as it traditionally applies to a person who’s facing death
and then as it applies to a person who’s grieving the loss of a loved one.
172
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Standing deep in denial
The first of the Five Stages of Dying and Loss is denial. A person in denial
doesn’t accept the reality of something unpleasant. That something unpleas-
ant (the 2-ton elephant in the room, so to speak) is none other than death.
More specifically, in the case of the Five Stages of Dying, denial is an inability
to admit that you’re dying or that someone you really love is dying. In the
case of the Five Stages of Loss, denial is an inability to admit that a person
you love who has died is really gone.
Denial of death by the terminally ill
For someone who’s been given a fatal medical diagnosis and whose death is
therefore imminent (as opposed to the rest of us who naively think that we’ll
be here forever), denial refers to the state of utter disbelief with which the
patient receives this type of diagnosis.
The rationalizations that can accompany this type of denial can run the gamut
from “It’s gotta be a mistake — you’re looking at somebody else’s X-ray” to
“There’s got to be a cure, a new drug, or operation that can beat this thing.”
So strong is a person’s core belief in immortality (to say nothing of the human
fear of death) that it’s a rare individual who can stoically take the news that
his life really is about to end. For most, the idea that they’re going to die is
simultaneously theoretically assented to and fundamentally denied.
173
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief
Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross
Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (1926–2004) was a world-
renowned medical doctor and psychiatrist who
revolutionized modern thinking about death and
dying. While in practice in New York and Denver,
she was shocked by the way dying patients
were shunned by medical professionals, espe-
cially doctors. In response, she began a series
of lectures to medical staff in which she talked
openly about dying.
In 1969, she published her first book, On Death
and Dying, which was a bestseller and seminal
work that remains required reading in most
medical and psychology curriculums. Her legacy
includes working directly with terminally ill chil-
dren, AIDS patients, and the elderly, as well as
helping to bring the hospice movement (which
originated in England) into the mainstream in
the United States. She and her work have also
educated countless health professionals on the
vital importance of dealing with the dying hon-
estly and compassionately.
For more on Dr. Kübler-Ross, her work with end-
of-life issues, and her classic stages of dying
and grieving, visit her official Web site at www.
elisabethkublerross.com.

I suspect that it’s precisely this kind of denial that’s responsible for so many
terminal patients seeking out new experimental therapies and undergoing
extra rounds of radiation and chemotherapy when they may benefit more
from purely palliative care (care that has to do with pain management and
comfort rather than with curing) and the support of hospice. However, folks
who are placed on hospice care don’t always deal with the stage of denial any
better. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve visited as a hospice patient-care
volunteer (none of whom suffered from dementia) who continued to ask me
visit after visit, “Why am I on hospice?” Ultimately, it’s just not that easy for
anyone to accept that his time is finally at an end.
The stage of denial isn’t limited to the patient who’s actively dying; some-
times the patient’s family is in much more denial about the impending death
than the patient is. The family’s denial can become a huge problem when it
means that the patient doesn’t fully come to terms with his own death. To
accommodate his family’s state of denial, the patient may not speak with his
family members about issues of real concern related to his dying in order to
protect their feelings by keeping up the façade that everything will be okay.
Denial that a deceased loved one is really gone
For grieving people, denial refers to the air of unreality that accompanies the
knowledge that someone they love has died.
This kind of disbelief is almost never an actual denial that your loved one is
really deceased but rather an inability to take in the full reality of his death.
Rather than being some sort of delusion on your part, this type of denial is
more like a defense mechanism that protects your psyche from the full
trauma of the death.
The inability to fully grasp the idea that your loved one is truly gone appears
even when the death is fully anticipated, as it is in the case of a death from a
long-standing serious illness or from old age. Denial is also equally prevalent
whether you actually observe the person’s death or you only hear the sad
news from a trusted medical professional or family member.
Most often, a grieving person’s denial of a loved one’s death takes the form of
intermittent forgetfulness that the person is deceased, thus allowing you to
slip up and anticipate again being in his presence. This is most likely to happen
to you when you first wake in the morning and return home from a day at
work only to find your expectation dashed. As time goes on, however, this
little charade becomes more and more difficult to keep up as it becomes
more and more disappointing and hurtful. Slowly but surely, the sad and
bitter truth that your loved one will never return comes home to roost, and
this denial stage of loss loses its energy and finally plays itself out.
174
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

This type of denial is unrelenting in cases where a loved one goes missing
and there’s no independent confirmation of his death. The hope springs 
eternal that a loved one who’s missing in action, has run away, or has been
abducted is still alive somewhere and will return some day. For many caught
in this terrible situation, accepting an unconfirmed death of a loved one is
tantamount to dishonoring that person by giving up hope. The people left
behind can’t allow themselves to move out of this stage and complete their
grieving; they need professional help to develop ways to deal with the con-
flict between the need to continue to honor the missing loved one and yet
grieve the loss.
Cooling the secondary stage of anger
Anger is a fairly multifaceted emotion. When you characterize someone as
being angry, you may mean that he’s simply annoyed and frustrated with the
situation, or you may mean that he’s completely riled up and therefore furi-
ous over it. The emotional intensity of anger runs the gamut from a mild irri-
tation to a full-blown rage.
Anger in the sense of annoyance is connected with frustration. Anger in the
sense of rage is almost always connected to fear. People can become easily
angered in both senses of the word anytime they fear that they’re no longer
in control of their own futures. The timing and even the circumstances under
which you die are so seldom in your control that some degree of anger over
your own death or the death of a loved one seems almost inevitable.
Although anger is the second of Kübler-Ross’s Five Stages of Dying and Loss,
this doesn’t mean that people always enter this stage after the initial stage of
denial. In fact, it’s quite possible for dying and grieving people to skip the
denial stuff entirely and go directly to rage. (This is especially true when the
circumstances of the death are deemed to be particularly unfair.)
Anger at dying
Because dying normally brings up feelings of both frustration and fear, one
can reasonably expect people facing imminent death to feel angry about the
situation at one time or another.
 Anger at dying may stem from exasperation with the patent unfairness
of the situation, such as when the death is very untimely (as in the case
of a dying mother with young children) or completely unwarranted (as
in the case of a young man dying from a misdiagnosed illness).
 Anger at dying may stem simply from the fear that one feels at the
prospect of soon losing all control over one’s future and then having 
to face the unknown of death.
175
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

When dealing with a dying loved one who’s particularly angry at the situa-
tion, you need to be very patient and allow him to vent as much as possible
in the hope that he can get beyond the anger before he dies. Be very careful
not to engage in any arguments regarding the validity of his anger. The point
here isn’t whether the anger is justified but that your loved one gets out all
these feelings before he dies.
Anger over the loss of a loved one
Often people who’ve just lost a loved one have to deal with their anger over
the death as their initial task in grieving the loss. They may direct their anger
at themselves or at others.
When your anger is directed at yourself, it’s usually the result of some sort 
of guilt or regret that you have regarding the loss. The guilt may stem from
something you did or didn’t do that, in your mind, would have or might have
prevented the loss from happening. (It’s what I call the “coulda, shoulda,
woulda” syndrome.)
No matter how strongly you feel that you may have been able to prevent the
loss, you did the best you could at the time. Further, you need to appreciate
these feelings as part and parcel of the entire remorse and sadness you have
over the loss. Further, you need to understand that, guilt or no guilt, your
remorse and sadness are necessary parts of grieving a loved one.
When your anger’s focused on someone or some force outside yourself, it
usually lands in one of two places:
 The social, medical, or even cosmic powers you hold responsible either
for doing something that caused the death or for not doing something
that could have prevented it
 The deceased loved one
When your anger’s focused on other authorities whom you hold responsible
for the death, you have to be particularly careful not to get caught up in an
almost endless game of justification. In this game, all your energy goes
toward recounting and elaborating on the injustice of the death, leaving you
little or no energy for any other grieving work. To stop this process of recrim-
ination and jump-start the rest of the grieving process, you may have to for-
give the parties you hold responsible so that you can move on into other
phases of grief (see Chapter 10 for more on practicing forgiveness).
It may surprise you to know that many bereaved people direct their anger at
the loved ones they lost rather than at themselves or any other powers. The
irrationality of such anger, to say the least, doesn’t prevent the bereaved
176
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

from feeling it. For example, when you consider the death to have been pre-
ventable (as in the case of an accident caused by the deceased’s own reck-
lessness, suicide, or an avoidable illness or physical condition), you become
angry because your loved one didn’t exercise more caution, reach out and
get the necessary help, or take better care of himself.
You can become angry at a loved one for leaving you even if you consider the
death to have been completely unpreventable. Particularly if you lose your
loved one as a result of an accident or illness before his time (as opposed to
an accident or illness in old age), the anger you feel toward him simply may
be misdirected. Instead of focusing your anger on outside authorities such as
the doctors or God, you focus your anger on the loved one who has left you
bereft.
Dealing with the stage of bargaining
Bargaining is the third stage in the Five Stages of Dying and Loss outlined by
Kübler-Ross. Bargaining has a couple of interpretations, the most common of
which is to haggle with someone to get them to meet your price (as in getting
a bargain by bringing the price down). The second common meaning for bar-
gaining is to get someone to agree to your terms for a purchase or contract
(as in striking a bargain by coming to terms).
People who are actively dying engage in both types of bargaining: striking the
best possible terms for dying as well as trying to strike a bargain that enables
them to avoid death entirely. The bargaining, however, that bereaved people
do is almost entirely of the latter type; they strike a bargain under which
they’re able to come to terms with the loss.
177
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief
My anger over the loss of a loved one
In April 1998, I lost my life partner of 16 years
from complications from hepatitis C contracted
as a result of a blood transfusion given in an
emergency surgery some 20 years before. At
the time of his death, my partner was ninth on a
waiting list for a liver transplant that could have
saved his life.
In grieving this loss, I initially felt anger at the
medical system for its inability to provide a liver
replacement as well as at myself for not being
more effective in navigating and working the
system and getting my partner the necessary
replacement. Near the end of my grieving
process, however, I got angry at my partner
simply for leaving me and putting me through so
much grief and sadness. Oddly enough, in my
case, this misplaced and totally irrational anger
marked the final phases of my grieving this loss.

Bargaining the terms of one’s death
By and large, dying folks who enter the stage of bargaining are those with
fatal illnesses for which medicine can provide no cures. They believe in God
or, at the very minimum, have some sort of belief in a higher power with
whom they can strike deals.
People with curable illnesses normally spend their remaining time trying to
obtain the cures and therefore don’t enter the bargaining stage. And those
who don’t have a strong a sense of a higher power with whom they can nego-
tiate have no need to enter the bargaining stage either.
The actual terms of the bargains that a dying person wants to make with a
divine power depend on his particular condition. He may want to strike a
deal under which he will mend his previous ways (in regard to either his
health or morals) if only God (or the higher power) spares his life by curing
him. In essence, he’s asking for a pardon from the divine for behaviors that
he believes have resulted in his illness.
In contrast, a dying person may bargain with God for less than a full reprieve,
asking only that he be allowed the additional time needed to accomplish
something that he feels he must do before he dies (such as see his children
graduate or marry or visit his birthplace one last time). Many times, the only
thing the dying person has to offer God in return is a promise that, if he gets
the time he needs, he’ll ask for nothing further. Of course, assuming he does
get extra time, he probably can’t resist asking the divine for just a little more.
The deals that people strike in the bargaining stage often have a similar struc-
ture and content to the regrets that their loved ones express in grieving their
losses (see the next section). When you’re dying, the bargaining is a way for
you to express the misgivings you have about the quality of the life you’ve
lived and the unknown nature of death; it’s also a way to feel like you’re
avoiding your fate. When you’re grieving, the regrets you mull over are very
often a way for you to come to terms with the impact of the loss and a pre-
cursor to integrating it into your life.
Bargaining as part of coming to terms with the loss
For the person grieving the loss of a loved one, the idea of bargaining with a
higher power for a different outcome doesn’t apply. Seeing that the loss is
already a fact (and assuming that the person’s not in the stage of denying it),
the bargaining that a grieving person does is quite different from that of a
dying person.
Bargaining in this case refers to all the “what if” and “if only” type of regrets
that so often plague your grieving. They represent all the “coulda, woulda,
178
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

shoulda” doubts that so easily can overwhelm you and over which you prob-
ably agonize; they’re the doubts about what you or anyone else could or
should have done that would have prevented the death of your loved one
and, more to the point, spared you all this grief.
I’m convinced that this type of bargaining can be very useful in grieving, if
only as part of the process of really coming to terms with the loss. By evalu-
ating (and yes, even agonizing over) all the conditions that you think may
have resulted in a different, much-desired outcome, you eventually may 
come to realize that none of this very painful and distressing bargaining 
work changes the reality of your loss. You then can move on from “what if?”
to “what now?”
In this way, the bargaining stage can be a very important part of your grieving
work. Being able to come to terms with the loss is an important step (and a
necessary precursor, for some) in really accepting the reality of the loss. And
by accepting the loss, you give yourself the opportunity to move on to the
final work of reconciling yourself to this acknowledged reality.
Coping with the stage of depression
Depression is the fourth stage in the Kübler-Ross Five Stages of Dying and
Loss. In the context of these stages, depression refers to the symptoms com-
monly seen as part of clinical depression — diminished motivation, interest,
and energy along with dejected moods — that result directly from facing
death or dealing with a loss of a loved one.
Both of the stages of depression in Kübler-Ross’s processes of dying and
grieving are differentiated from clinical depression (as a psychological ail-
ment) in that they’re considered to be natural within the dying or grieving
processes. Depression related to death and grief normally dissipates on its
own without requiring the intervention of professional psychological coun-
seling or antidepressant drugs.
Depression during the dying process
In the case of a person who’s dying from a fatal disease and suffering depres-
sion, the symptoms of depression often are intertwined with the general
physical discomfort and disability of the illness. In such a case, the depres-
sion symptoms also may be directly related to the medications that he’s
taking to fight the disease or to alleviate the resulting pain.
Bouts of depression are to be expected in any person facing death. After all,
he’s dealing with the idea of losing all control over his future and having to
say goodbye to all he loves.
179
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

Interestingly enough, in many people facing death, depression seems to come
and go in real bouts (like anger) instead of forming the general emotional
background against which the death plays out.
Depression during the grieving process
Depression is a very common stage of grief. For some bereaved people, peri-
ods of depression marked by a general flatness of emotion and lack of moti-
vation tend to follow periods of extreme sadness and emotional outbursts.
For others, depression is the general emotional background against which all
the other stages and manifestations of grieving take place. For these folks,
coming out of this general depression is often the harbinger of the end of
active grieving and the onset of the stage of acceptance (which I discuss in
the next section).
One of the suggestions that Dr. Kübler-Ross makes for bereaved people suf-
fering depression in her book On Grief and Grieving is to welcome rather 
than fight the depression. How do you do that? By allowing the sadness and
emptiness of the depression to cleanse you and by exploring your loss in 
its entirety. You shouldn’t be overly concerned with the nature of your
depression — whether it comes and goes in bouts or seems to form your 
general emotional background. Instead, keep in mind that this depression 
is not only a necessary part of grieving but also will most likely leave of its
own accord after it has done its job.
Reaching the stage of acceptance
Kübler-Ross names acceptance as the final stage of her Five Stages of Dying
and Loss. The only problem with calling this final stage “acceptance” is that
the word sometimes gives the faulty impression that in order to reach this
stage, you need to be 100 percent okay either with your imminent death or
with the profound loss you’ve suffered. That simply isn’t the case: You can
tolerate your impending death or the loss you’ve suffered without ever feel-
ing completely all right with it.
Indeed, reaching the final stage of acceptance simply signifies that you’ve
learned to live with the new reality that life has forced on you, and you’re
ready to move on in light of the change. Therefore, the real power of this
stage lies in the way it can enable you to acknowledge your fate while no
longer being limited and entirely defined by it.
180
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Accepting your own death
Accepting your own impending death is one of the most difficult things to do.
In fact, it’s so difficult that many people never make it to this state of accep-
tance until just before they die.
One way to look at acceptance is as a kind of state of grace in which the
person facing death is released from the turmoil of anger and denial as well
as the weightier emotions that accompany depression. For many people, the
acceptance of death is as fleeting as the anger and sadness they feel from
time to time about the situation. A special few, however, reach the stage of
acceptance and never leave it; these fortunate people are able to tolerate
their deaths and, in so doing, transcend them.
How long the stage of acceptance lasts depends a great deal on a person’s
character and the circumstances under which he’s dying. It’s an old adage
among death professionals that “a person dies the way he lives.” Someone
who lived his life fairly conservatively, not welcoming many changes, is apt to
find death very hard to welcome. In contrast, someone who continually took
risks and always seemed to relish a new challenge is more likely to accept the
reality of death. As for the circumstances of death, an elderly man who has
lived a relatively full life and is leaving behind scores of children and grand-
children will probably find death much easier to welcome than a relatively
young man who’s just getting started in life and is leaving behind very young
children.
Accepting the death of a loved one
Whereas reaching the stage where you accept your own death is not at all
necessary in the dying process (you can die quite successfully protesting and
even denying the whole thing up to your very last breath), this isn’t the case
when it comes to grieving.
In order to complete the grieving process, you must accept the death of your
loved one. If you can’t accept the death — at least in the sense of learning to
live with it — you can’t begin to integrate the death into your life and move
on (creating what many grief counselors call a new normal).
As far as I’m concerned, the Kübler-Ross stage of acceptance is the most
essential stage in the grieving process. If you remain unable to accept the
loss, by definition, you remain unable to grieve the loss. Another way of look-
ing at this is to consider the first four of the Five Stages of Loss as the normal
phases that you pass through for the sole purpose of reaching the stage of
accepting the loss of a loved one. In this way, denial, anger, bargaining, and
depression are simply means to the end of attaining this acceptance.
181
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

Most people can’t get to this place where they can abide the loss of a loved
one until after they’ve experienced all the denial, anger, bargaining, and
depression that the grief brings. The other four stages are the tools needed in
order to learn how to tolerate and find yourself a place in the alien world into
which the loss has thrust you.
The Four Tasks of Mourning
The Five Stages of Grieving that Dr. Kübler-Ross derives from her Five Stages
of Dying is the standard way to evaluate the grieving process and one’s
progress with it. However, it isn’t the only system available for this purpose.
In place of stages of grieving, Dr. J. William Worden, a clinical psychologist
with a specialty in terminal illness and bereavement, developed the Four
Tasks of Mourning as a way to describe the grieving process and assess one’s
place in it.
The Four Tasks of Mourning as Dr. Worden currently outlines them are:
1. Accept the reality of the loss.
2. Work through the pain of grief.
3. Adjust to a changed environment.
4. Emotionally relocate the deceased and move on with life.
As you can see from this list, the Four Tasks of Mourning are much more
proactive than Kübler-Ross’s Five Stages of Grieving. In very general ways,
the tasks outline the steps that, according to Dr. Worden, most bereaved
people must undertake in order to deal effectively with the profound loss of a
loved one. Again, remember that you may not accomplish these tasks in the
order in which they are presented here — grieving just isn’t that linear of a
process for most folks.
Accepting the reality of the loss
In Worden’s Four Tasks of Mourning, the first task that a bereaved person
must take on is accepting the reality of the loss. This first task seems to be
the equivalent of Dr. Kübler-Ross’s fifth and final grieving stage (acceptance).
So, at first glance, it would appear as though Worden begins right where
Kübler-Ross leaves off.
182
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Actually, the work that you do in accepting the loss in Worden’s account of
the grieving process is much more comparable to the work that you must do
in Kübler-Ross’s initial stage of denial.
According to Worden, all profound losses are surrounded by a certain atmos-
phere of unreality, a sense that the loved one isn’t really gone. As a result, the
initial task of grieving is to accept the death on both an intellectual and emo-
tional level so that you fully acknowledge that your loved one is never coming
back to you.
All the traditional mourning rituals, including such things as the public wake,
funeral, and any type of memorial ceremonies, help you begin the process of
accepting your loved one’s death as real. Also, taking every opportunity to
tell your story over and over again can help in this task, and there are no
forums better suited for doing this than grief counseling and grief support
groups (see Chapter 14 for more).
Working through the pain of the loss
Worden’s second task of mourning is to work through the pain of the loss,
which he specifically characterizes as the “pain of separation.” By and large,
this task requires you to feel all the emotions attached to the pain of your
grief as well as find adequate and appropriate ways to express them.
It’s one thing to feel tremendously angry at the death of a loved one but quite
another to find the right time and place in which to vent your rage and frus-
tration. For example, it’s quite appropriate and beneficial to express your
183

threatening illness and life-threatening behavior.

fury by beating a pillow in your bedroom or to go a few rounds with a punch-
ing bag in the basement, but it’s quite inappropriate and counterproductive
to express this anger by screaming at your children for playing boisterously
in the house or to smash a favorite heirloom vase into smithereens in front of
your family members.
Finding the right place and time to express your emotions is a really difficult
part of working through the pain of grief. At the outset of grieving, waves of
intense feelings, especially sadness, often come over you without warning.
These waves of emotions are so strong that they threaten to overwhelm you.
If you’re not with people with whom you’re comfortable sharing these intense
emotions, the best thing you can do when you’re about to be overwhelmed
by your emotions is excuse yourself and then literally head for cover (your
own bedroom if you’re home or the restroom if you’re at work or in some
other public place) where you can let the feelings out. (I promise you the
emotions won’t wash you away, no matter how fierce they feel.)
When it comes to finding appropriate ways to express the feelings that come
from the pain of your grief, you’re often guided by the kind of emotion you’re
feeling.
 Anger usually requires a physical outlet such as yelling, shouting, and
even physical activity such as punching, flailing, and running.
 Sadness usually requires a physical outlet such as crying, moaning,
screaming, and even wailing.
 Guilt can require the same types of physical outlets as anger and sad-
ness. It also may require you to be with someone with whom you can
freely express your feelings.
 Anxiety can require you to get to a place where you feel safe. It also may
require you to be with someone you trust who can comfort you and with
whom you can freely express your feelings.
Beyond these obvious physical outlets for your anger and sadness, you may
find a number of less apparent activities that allow you to get your emotions
out. For example, you may be able to work off some of your anger by doing
manual labor. The energy of your anger also may motivate you to undertake a
task such as cleaning out the garage or organizing your CD collection.
Give a voice to some of the sadness you’re feeling through creative projects
such as putting together memory albums with old photos or multimedia pro-
jects that incorporate digital photos, music, and video reflecting your rela-
tionship with your loved one and telling the story of his life. In this vein, you
may also want to consider keeping a handwritten or online journal in which
184
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

you can vent your feelings as well as reflect on your loved one. Some people
also use journaling as a way to communicate with a lost loved one; flip to
Chapter 14 for more on various types of memorials you can create that may
help you express your feelings about the deceased.
Adjusting to the changed environment
The third of the Four Tasks of Mourning is to adjust to a changed environ-
ment both in terms of relating to the outside world as well as in terms of your
own internal feelings and beliefs. When you lose someone you love, espe-
cially a member of the family with whom you lived day in and day out, adapt-
ing to the absence of the person is, to say the least, a major, long-term
undertaking.
Coping with the absence of your loved one
If the person you lost is someone with whom you shared a lot of your time
(such as your child, life partner, close sibling, or very dear friend), you’re left
with a whole bunch of empty time on your hands. And you have to find a way
to fill this time with more than just your grief over the absence of your loved
one if you’re ever going to be able to adjust to living without him.
Some people attempt to fill the time that otherwise would have been spent
with these loved ones by becoming closer to and spending more time with
surviving family members and friends. Others occupy their time by taking up
new hobbies, engaging in physical activities, and learning new skills.
Taking on new roles
If you’re grieving the loss of a spouse, the adjustments that you must make
aren’t limited simply to filling the time you would have otherwise spent with
your significant other. Often a spouse is a best friend, confidant, and some-
one with whom you’re physically intimate as well as someone who provides
economic and decision-making support.
In attempting to adjust to the world without your spouse, you have to come
to grips with your entirely new role and responsibilities when it comes to
making major decisions on your own and providing economic stability both
for yourself and your family. Moreover, you’re forced to fulfill this new and
often very challenging role while struggling to reconcile yourself to being
deprived of all the emotional and physical intimacy your spouse provided.
(Refer to Chapter 4 for a more detailed discussion of the particular chal-
lenges involved with adjusting to the loss of a spouse or life partner.)
185
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

For most bereaved people, successful adjustment requires a significant
change in attitude about the relationship with the deceased. You not only
have to get used to being without the companionship of your loved one, but
you also have to accept the fact that your relationship with that person is for-
ever frozen in time. You also may have to ask for help from other people in
your life whom you trust.
Even if you’re left with many precious and worthwhile memories of the rela-
tionship with your loved one, you still have to resign yourself to the fact that,
from this time forward, you have to grow and develop independent of that
person. The best you can do in this circumstance is see to it that you incor-
porate the finest qualities from your relationship into all the new relation-
ships you build.
Emotionally relocating the 
deceased and moving on
The last of Worden’s Four Tasks of Mourning is to emotionally relocate the
deceased in order to move on with your life. This last task is the most com-
plex as well as the one that’s the most difficult for most bereaved folks to
accomplish. To be able to accomplish this task, you have to be ready to make
the following two adjustments:
 Invest yourself emotionally in something or someone new.
 Shift your feelings for your lost loved one in such a way that allows you
to move on with your life.
The phrase “move on” doesn’t always sit well with people suffering profound
grief. The problem stems from the supposition that moving on with your life
means necessarily forgetting the loved one you’ve lost. This certainly is nei-
ther the reality of incorporating loss nor Dr. Worden’s intended meaning for
the fourth task.
When you reach the point at the end of your grieving when you can move 
on in your life, most likely you’ve already incorporated the deceased person
into your life in such a way that there’s no possibility of forgetting him. As I
explain throughout this book, one of the most effective ways to honor loved
ones you’ve lost and to keep their memories alive within you is to incorpo-
rate their best qualities and the finest aspects of the relationships you had
with them into all the relationships you maintain and build.
Although moving on generally signals the end of acute or active grieving for
most bereaved people, keep in mind that reaching this stage doesn’t guaran-
tee that you’ll never again suffer grief over this loss. The original feelings of
grief can well up suddenly long after you think that the grieving process is
186
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

over and you’re finally okay. They can even happen on occasion throughout
one’s life.
Sometimes these upsurges are triggered by particular events such as the
dawning of another anniversary day or revisiting a location with special
meaning in your relationship with the deceased. Other times, you don’t real-
ize any obvious triggers and don’t understand why you’re once again mourn-
ing the person.
The most important thing to remember about such an upsurge of grief is that
it’s a very temporary phenomenon. Unlike the emotional turmoil associated
with grieving the person’s loss, the sad feelings connected with it are very
short-lived. And as time goes on, fewer and fewer events trigger upsurges
until, for most folks, they eventually completely fade away.
The Six “R” Processes of Mourning
As if the Kübler-Ross Five Stages of Grieving and the Worden Four Tasks of
Mourning weren’t sufficient, Dr. Therese Rando developed yet another grief
model system charting the phases that people normally experience in griev-
ing a profound loss. Her model identifies six individual processes (which are
a cross between a Kübler-Ross stage and a Worden task) that she calls the Six
Processes of Mourning.
Rando’s Six “R” Processes of Mourning are routinely called the Six R’s
because the first word in each process begins with the letter r: recognize,
react, recollect, relinquish, readjust, and reinvest. (Come to think of it, this
abbreviation is much more logical than education’s more common three R’s
[reading, writing, and arithmetic] because only one of those even begins with
the letter r!)
The Six R’s as outlined by Dr. Rando’s model of grieving are:
1. Recognize the loss. This involves acknowledging the reality of the death
as well as comprehending what caused it.
2. React to the separation. This involves identifying and expressing all the
feelings and psychological reactions associated with the loss.
3. Recollect and re-experience the deceased and the relationship. This
involves reviewing and remembering the relationship as well as experi-
encing once again the feelings associated with it.
4. Relinquish old attachments to the deceased and the old assumptive
world. This involves surrendering your old connections with your lost
loved one and the world you shared before the death.
187
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

5. Readjust to move adaptively into a new world without forgetting the
old. This involves developing a new relationship with your lost loved
one along with adopting a new identity that includes new ways of being
in the world.
6. Reinvest in life. This involves taking the emotional energy that you once
put into the relationship with your loved one and putting it into new
relationships that can bring you some type of gratification.
As you can see in this list, the work called for in some of these processes is
very similar to that in the Five Stages of Loss and the Four Tasks of Mourning
covered earlier in this chapter. What’s different and of particular interest here
is how specific the Six R’s are and how their specificity can help you under-
stand where you are emotionally and what work you still need to do.
Recognizing the loss
The first process in Rando’s Six R’s is to recognize the loss. This process 
is very similar to accepting the reality of the loss, which is the first of the
Worden’s Four Tasks of Mourning. However, Rando focuses on understanding
what caused the death as well as acknowledging its reality in Worden’s sense
of accepting it as real.
I would like to suggest that this recognition can include more than simply
understanding that death is real and the factors that caused it: It can also
include an initial and rudimentary understanding of the death’s lasting
188

impact on your life. As part of the process of recognizing the loss, you may
begin to appreciate its deeper significance in terms of the long-term changes
it will affect in you and the consequences it will have on your life.
And I think that when you’re capable of this broader type of recognition,
you’re in a very good position to be able to deal with some of the other Six R
processes, especially relinquishing old attachments and readjusting to your
new world.
Reacting to the separation
The second of the Six R’s is to react to the separation from your loved one.
This is the process that includes all the pain and sorrow of your grief along
with your physical and psychological reactions to the loss. As part of this
process, you need to identify your feelings as well as find ways to express
them (see Chapter 14 for some ideas).
Going through this process of reacting to the separation from your loved one
also includes identifying and dealing with all the secondary losses that result
from his death. These secondary losses can be anything from a loss of emo-
tional and financial security to such things as a loss of well-being and lack of
continued faith in the overall goodness of the world.
Recollecting and re-experiencing 
the deceased
The third of Dr. Rando’s Six R’s is to recollect and re-experience the deceased.
The recollecting part of this process necessarily includes remembering your
lost loved one and appreciating the relationship you shared. This type of 
relationship review also includes reliving the feelings associated with these
memories.
Personally, I see the re-experiencing process as also requiring something
more because re-experiencing your lost loved one isn’t always a simple
matter of just recalling experiences frozen in time.
To fully re-experience a loved one after death, you also need to find ways in
which to see that person in a new light as well as to stay in contact with him
so that he’s fully part of the new world that you face after your grieving is
done. Here are a few suggestions for doing just that:
189
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

 Share the story of your relationship with anyone who will listen, noting
how its details change over time and depending upon the person to
whom you’re telling it.
 Speak directly to your lost loved one in prayers, journal entries, or let-
ters that you address to him.
 Do meditations on specific qualities that your loved one manifested (see
Chapter 23 for specific meditation ideas).
For many bereaved people, re-experiencing the deceased is the greatest chal-
lenge in the entire process of grieving a loved one. It’s just a lot easier to
freeze your loved one in time (which too often can lead to ultimately forget-
ting him altogether). You may find it too arduous a task to probe and dissect
your relationship with the loved one to determine the qualities that you want
to continue functioning in your life.
Canonizing the deceased loved one by conveniently forgetting all about his
failings and foibles and placing a halo on his head is too common when fami-
lies remember their lost ones. It’s as dangerous a practice as demonizing 
the deceased because the almost insurmountable gulf it creates between you
and your loved one isn’t conducive to recollecting or re-experiencing him.
Remembering only the best things about your lost loved one is so easy to do
in large part thanks to society’s emphasis on always eulogizing the deceased
and its general disparagement of speaking ill of the dead.
Relinquishing attachments 
to the deceased
The fourth process of the Six R’s is to relinquish your old attachments to the
deceased along with the old assumptive world. This process is really unique
to Dr. Rando’s grief model.
I assume that the idea of giving up your old attachments to your loved one in
the first part of the statement is quite clear (although you may still question
its value). I’ll bet, however, that you’re wondering what in the blazes it means
to give up the old assumptive world.
Actually, this is just psychology talk for the basic idea that in order for you to
move forward, at some point in your grieving process you have to let go of
the things that linked you with your loved one.
Letting go doesn’t mean that you forget your loved one or all the things that
you shared together (indeed, doing so would violate the third of the Six R’s
discussed in the previous section). Rather, it means that you must eventually
accept the following realities about the loss:
190
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

 The separation between you and your loved one is final.
 You can only remain in an emotional holding pattern for so long 
before you have to let go of the loss for the sake of your own health 
and well-being.
 Trying to resist your changed world by holding onto the past you shared
with your lost loved one is not only an impossible feat but a self-defeating
one as well.
As soon as you’re able to surrender your old emotional attachments to your
loved one (and this does take some time, so don’t push yourself if you’re not
ready) and appreciate (or re-experience) your loved one anew, you’ve accom-
plished the major work of grieving the loss. At this juncture, you know that
you’ll be okay in your new world, and you can be grateful for the love and
what you were able to share with your lost loved one.
Readjusting to move into a new world
The fifth of the Six R’s is one of the more long-winded ones in Dr. Rando’s
grief model: Readjust to move adaptively into a new world without forgetting
the old. As inelegant as this fifth process may sound, it’s really quite a natural
follow-up to the fourth process of relinquishing your old attachments to the
deceased and the world you shared together.
In letting go of your old attachments and assumptions of how the world
should be, you move almost by definition into a new world and in so doing,
establish a new identity. However, once you make it to this new world, you
still have to establish yourself there. In order to do so, you must remain open
to change and once again be willing to invest yourself in it (the sixth and final
R process).
It’s worth noting that some grief counselors characterize the new world that
you move into as your new normal. The basic idea is that the loss and grief
that accompany it are so disruptive that almost nothing in the mourning
period resembles the normal world you knew before. It also means that you
can’t go back to the ways things were before the death. Therefore, as your
grieving comes to an end, you naturally establish another routine that forms
the basis of your new normal.
The idea that you’ll ever be able to consider anything as “normal” in a world
devoid of your loved one may initially strike you as highly improbable. You
may feel as though you’ve been so changed by the loss and all the pain you’re
enduring as part of your grief that you’ll never see anything as normal again.
191
Chapter 11: Working through the Process of Grief

However, as you learn how to live in this new world and develop new rela-
tionships within it, you will also undoubtedly reconnect to routines that are
filled to the brim with all that good, old-fashioned normality you missed so
much during this dark time of grieving.
Reinvesting in your life
The final process in Dr. Rando’s Six R’s is simply to reinvest in life. This last
process is my favorite, and it’s a fitting way to conclude an explanation of the
phases of grieving.
The word “reinvest” simply means to invest again. “Invest,” however, has two
basic meanings: The first, more common meaning is to endow in the sense of
putting resources such as money, time, or emotion into some venture, and
the second, less frequently used meaning is to empower in the sense of
making someone powerful or giving one authority over something.
The idea of reinvesting in your life as the final process of grieving covers both
of these meanings: You finally feel connected again with all the aspects of
your everyday life and fully empowered to make the most of them.
During the grieving process, it’s quite common for you to feel dissociated
from the routines of your everyday life. As you try to carry on in strict sur-
vival mode, you may feel as though you’re sleepwalking through all your daily
tasks and social encounters. It may be only for the briefest moments that
you’re able to put aside your deep sorrow and overriding grief to truly
engage in what’s going on around you.
When it dawns on you, this final process of reinvesting in life may feel like
waking up from a long sleep. You find yourself able to go off autopilot more
and more as your interest in your new life (that new normal) grows.
Entering into this phase doesn’t mean that you’ve forgotten your loss or that
you’ll forever be free of its grief. It simply means that dealing with this loss
and feeling its grief are no longer in the forefront of your life, demanding most
of your physical and emotional energy.
To me, this work is the most rewarding part of grieving (the payoff, so to
speak, if something as painful and difficult as grieving can be said to have any
such a thing). You go beyond the mere acceptance of the loss and moving on
from it to using the loss to shape the course and direction of the rest of your
life. As a result, your life after bereavement is a place not only where you rec-
ollect your lost loved one but also in which he can continue to have influence
and provide guidance. (You can find more ideas on how to integrate a pro-
found loss into your life in Chapter 18.)

H
eaven knows that, even under the best of circumstances, grieving a pro-
found loss is very difficult. Despite this fact, most people are able to
grieve the loss of a loved one successfully, by which I mean they’re able to
complete the process of grieving in due course. And it’s understood as well
that each person determines the exact course that this grieving takes as well
as the timetable on which he completes the work.
Unfortunately, not everybody is capable of grieving each of the profound
losses he experiences with the same aplomb. In some cases, the grieving is
forestalled or becomes stalled shortly after the loss occurs. In such a situa-
tion, the grieving process becomes troubled in ways not usually associated
with this always challenging work.
This chapter explores the subject of grieving processes that either have trou-
ble getting started or get stuck at certain places by looking at how and why
some profound losses are more complex and difficult to grieve than others. It
also looks at some of the techniques you may employ to jump-start grieving a
loss that you’re having trouble grieving.
I begin this chapter with a brief introduction to trauma and its relationship to
grief. Then I help you recognize when a loss is traumatic rather than simply
complicated. I share some of the ways that people avoid starting the grieving
process before looking at some of the techniques that you may employ to
break through this kind of resistance.

Relating Trauma and Grief
The word “trauma” has both layman’s and clinical definitions. Most people
think of trauma as either a physical or psychological injury or wound that
one receives often as a result of a sudden or violent action. To a psychologist,
trauma is more technical; it refers to an emotional or psychological shock or
stress that results in disordered feelings or behavior or feelings of extreme
anxiety.
The death of a loved one is surely traumatic in terms of the layman’s defini-
tion of the word. However, the death isn’t automatically traumatic in the clini-
cal sense used by mental health professionals.
For the loss to be traumatic in the clinical sense of the word, your loved one’s
death itself must be either traumatic (as in the case of a particularly violent
death, for example) or linked to some other traumatic events in your life. The
traumatic events tied to the death may be indicative of a troubled or at least
ambivalent relationship that you maintained with your loved one before his
death.
Quite often clinical trauma is associated with the specific psychological con-
dition known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This condition typically
is characterized by a number of symptoms that can include depression, anxi-
ety, nightmares, and flashbacks as well as avoidance of all reminders of the
event.
In terms of these PTSD symptoms, it’s worth noting that flashbacks aren’t like
vivid memories but rather are more like actually reliving the original trau-
matic events. Along the same lines, avoiding all reminders of the event isn’t
the same as being somewhat uneasy with the subject but rather more like
being completely unable to bring the subject to consciousness in any way.
194
Part II: Experiencing Grief 
Clinical trauma as a physical response
Trauma is a physical response to a situation that
your brain considers seriously threatening to
your well-being. The feelings of anxiety and
stress come from the impulse to flee the threat-
ening situation (that old “fight or flight”
response) only to find that you have no way to
escape. This anxiety plus the lack of a way out
combine to make trauma so powerful both
physically and emotionally. It’s powerful
enough, in fact, for the same feelings of anxiety
and physical helplessness to manifest when-
ever your brain even faintly perceives a situa-
tion that may threaten your well-being in a
similar way.

Recognizing Traumatic Losses
More often than not, traumatic losses result from either of the following:
 Traumas experienced in the course of a very troubled relationship with
the loved one
 Traumatic circumstances surrounding the death
Quite often in the case of a traumatic loss, grieving the death isn’t possible
because it means having to relive the trauma associated with the loss. More-
over, many people who suffer a traumatic loss avoid reminders of the death
by continuing to deny its reality.
As I point out in Chapter 11 on the stages of grief, it’s quite common for you
initially to have trouble accepting the reality of the death (it just doesn’t
seem real at first). However, when the death isn’t particularly traumatic (or
complicated in some other way), you’re likely to move beyond this initial
stage of denial in due time. This isn’t the case, however, if you suffer a trau-
matic loss and have a great need to avoid all reminders of the death.
Under these circumstances, you continue to deny the reality of the death,
most often by attempting to freeze your life at a time before the loss. For
example, you may never change a thing in your loved one’s room or discard
any of his belongings. You also may continue to pattern your life strictly
according to the ways that your loved one would have preferred.
In addition, when you speak of your lost loved one, you’re likely to canonize
him or at least put him on a pedestal by speaking of him only in the highest
terms and by always praising his outstanding qualities. Even if he was rather
notorious for some less-than-perfect behavior, you speak nothing but acclaim.
Denying anything but stellar qualities in a lost loved one often is a defense
against feeling anything having to do with the loss. In overlooking all negative
qualities, you hope to maintain a block on all feelings of anxiety that naturally
arise whenever you focus on the resentments you still carry.
Grieving traumatic relationships
When mental health professionals speak about trauma, they sometimes dif-
ferentiate between the following:
195
Chapter 12: Troubled Grieving

 Impersonal trauma that ensues from events such as automobile acci-
dents, fires, natural disasters, and the like that can result in a traumatic
death that you must grieve (discussed in the section immediately 
following)
 Intensely personal trauma caused by the physical or emotional abuse at
the hands of a loved one that can result in a traumatic relationship that
you must grieve
Whereas both types of experiences can produce similar shock and stress,
trauma related to abuse carries an added element: It sets up a traumatic rela-
tionship whose toxicity is bound to outlive the death of the abuser.
It should come as absolutely no surprise to find out that people traumatized
by abuse from loved ones generally have great difficulty grieving the deaths
of their abusers. What may surprise you is that these people often suffer
greatly in their inability to grieve; they’re unable to find solace in the fact that
their abusers are now dead and gone with no way to ever harm them again.
If you’re a survivor of a traumatic relationship, you may feel like you can’t
afford to express your true feelings regarding your abuser. To do so would
put you at risk of being doubted by others as well as re-experiencing the
trauma of the abuse you endured. You may not be able to express any emo-
tions over the abuser’s death, or you may only speak well of the dead, not
daring to touch any of the rage and hurt you feel.
As the survivor of a traumatic relationship, you first need to grieve the loss of
trust and safety that resulted from the abuse before you can seriously con-
sider dealing with the death of your abuser in any way. With the help of psy-
chological and professional grief counseling, you can develop the skills
needed to cope with any recurring trauma and grieve the loss of your inno-
cence. Only then can you take up the complicated task of grieving a loved
one who failed so utterly in his obligation to protect and nurture you.
Grieving traumatic deaths
A traumatic death is quite simply any death of a loved one that produces
trauma-like symptoms in survivors. Most violent deaths, especially those wit-
nessed by a loved one as well as those involving intense media scrutiny and
prolonged legal proceedings, fall into this category. Some deaths that place
the bereaved under particularly unusual circumstances, including many sui-
cides (see Chapter 2), also fall into this category.
196
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

A death doesn’t have to be violent or particularly unusual to be traumatic to
a loved one. In many cases, a traumatic death may simply be a death that the
loved one considers either too upsetting to recall or too vivid to forget.
In trying to deal with a traumatic death of a loved one, you may find it too
distressing to recollect anything about the death and speak about it in any
way (an extreme form of denial). Or you may have the most difficulty keeping
the death out of your thoughts. The death in all its horrible detail (real or
imagined) keeps invading your thoughts, making you feel as though you’re
reliving the death. You end up in great distress and are unable to actually
start coping with the loss of the loved one.
For all intents and purposes, both of the following responses to a traumatic
death effectively grind the grieving process to a halt:
 Blocking out all recall of the loved one’s death: Prevents you from
doing any healing through expressing the pain of your grief as well as
through telling the stories of your relationship with the deceased
 Being completely overwhelmed by the horrible details of the loved
one’s death: Prevents you from feeling the pain of the loss of the rela-
tionship as opposed to feeling the intense pain inherent in reliving the
manner of death
You may get stuck continually reliving the traumatic death of a loved one
because you feel some level of responsibility for the death. Often, these feel-
ings of regret and guilt are undeserved. They say much more about your feel-
ings of inadequacy in regards to caring for the loved one, especially if he
assumed the role of a primary caregiver, than they say about your culpability
in the death.
Identifying Complicated Grieving
Complicated grieving is the technical name that grief professionals give to a
grieving process that gets stuck at some point, making it impossible for the
bereaved to successfully start or conclude the grieving process. Complicated
grieving is often a sign of unresolved problems in the relationship between
the bereaved and the deceased that make it more difficult than usual for the
bereft person to grieve.
Whereas a traumatic loss almost always makes for complicated grieving, you
need to keep in mind that not all complicated grieving involves traumatic
losses. Human relationships are sufficiently varied and complex to create all
sort of snags (some traumatic and some not) that can interrupt the grieving
process.
197
Chapter 12: Troubled Grieving

If you find that you’re unable to start grieving the loss of a loved one or you
aren’t getting through the grieving process, I recommend that you stop and
take stock of the relationship you had with your lost loved one. Depending
upon the intricacy of the relationship and its particular problems, you may
not be able to really assess it without the help of a mental health profes-
sional. However, by working through the issues that stand in your way of
grieving a loved one, you not only ultimately free yourself from the grief but
also create a new appreciation for yourself as you honestly face all the
aspects (good and bad) of your erstwhile relationship.
Complicated grieving in 
one-sided relationships
Almost all the relationships you build with your loved ones are complex and
multifaceted. Sometimes, however, these relationships aren’t as balanced as
you may like them to be. Unbalanced relationships — especially those in
which one person doesn’t have anywhere near as much influence or power as
the other — can often result in some level of complicated grieving when the
person wielding the greater influence dies.
Unfortunately, after the death, it’s far too late to rectify the balance of power,
and you’re left to deal with whatever damage this imbalance caused. Bereft of
a particularly powerful person in your life (whether a parent or a spouse),
you may experience an overwhelming sense of abandonment and emotions
that vacillate between great anger and acute apprehension.
Both the anger and the fear come from the same place of uncertainty — 
not knowing whether or not you have what it takes to survive on your own.
Instead of focusing on grieving the loss, you can only focus on the predica-
ment that your new status confers on you. Before you can feel the grief, you
must first deal with your lack of confidence and all the emotions that your
insecurity engenders. Many times, this requires the help of a mental health
professional other than a grief counselor who can help you work on these
aspects not entirely related to the pain of your loss.
Complicated grief in excessively 
dependent relationships
Relationships in which the two people are exceedingly dependent upon one
another for emotional support (sometimes referred to as a codependent rela-
tionship) can also result in complicated grief when either person dies. This
kind of dependent relationship may exist between a child and parent, but it
more commonly occurs between spouses and life partners.
198
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

Typically, the two companions are so close that one or both feel as though
they couldn’t live without the other. Then, when one of the two dies and this
misgiving is finally tested, the survivor finds himself hard-pressed to grieve
the loss.
Losing the person who defines you in so many ways is sometimes too much
too handle. As a reaction, you refuse to acknowledge the loss in an effort to
ward off grieving. More importantly, denial keeps you from having to admit
that the loss is real and that you have to change a great deal in order to
thrive rather than survive (see Chapter 11 for more on working through this
stage of the grieving process).
Instead of continually denying the loss, some survivors of codependent rela-
tionships refuse to stop mourning the loss of their loved ones. In essence,
they create a perpetual mourning in which they safely reside. This too is a
defense against real grieving (a process that has a definite end, even when
there’s no set timetable for reaching it). Perpetual mourning represents an
effort to keep the dependent relationship alive in some form and to insulate
the survivor and keep him from having to adjust to the new reality. The only
way for such a person to break through this kind of stalemate is for him to
realize that the end of the grieving is not synonymous with the end of the
relationship (see Chapters 18 and 19).
Typical Ways of Avoiding Grieving
There are probably as many ways to dodge grieving the loss of a loved one as
there are ways to grieve the loss. The old adage “You can bring a horse to

Queen Victoria and her perpetual 
mourning of Prince Albert
Queen Victoria of England (1819–1901) has the
distinction of having the longest reign of any
British monarch to date (64 years). She also
holds the distinction of going into a kind of per-
petual mourning for the loss of her husband of 21
years, Prince Albert. Upon Albert’s death in 1861,
Queen Victoria was so devastated that she went
into mourning for him for the remainder of her life
(some 40 years). She continued to wear black
and remained in semiseclusion (after being in
total seclusion for three years) until her death.
Moreover, she kept her court in mourning, for-
bidding them to wear bright colors, and she kept
Albert’s room exactly as it was at the time of his
death — clothes, furniture, and all.

water but you can’t make him drink” applies especially here: Life can bring
you to the juncture of grief by taking a loved one from you, but it can’t force
you to grieve the loss.
This section looks at a few of the more common ways that bereft people avoid
grieving: refusing to grieve, getting busy, and dulling the pain with drugs and
alcohol. Keep in mind that these three reactions, while all too common, are
only a sampling of the many methods that people come up with to avoid
facing the very hard work of grieving a loss.
Claiming to be “just fine”
The first and most obvious way of avoiding grief is refusing to grieve. (This is
technically known as absent grieving.) You can bet that a person’s doing some
mighty fine absent grieving when he tells you that he’s really fine and every-
thing’s okay the moment you offer your condolences shortly after the death.
Many times, people who refuse to grieve have the naive notion that they can
just leapfrog over the nasty business of mourning. If this is you, you may
almost will yourself not to feel anything. You may not even show emotion at
the funeral or memorial for your loved one. You may get busy right after the
death and stay busy in order to avoid your grief (see the next section for
more on burying yourself in projects).
As an absent mourner, you’re extremely uncomfortable discussing the death
of your loved one and usually refuse to discuss and acknowledge any feelings
related to the loss. You meet any expression of sympathy and condolence
with a quick change of the subject to something more positive. You no longer
speak of your loved one (as though he never existed) and therefore never tell
stories about the relationship you shared.
In extreme circumstances, you immediately clean out your loved one’s clos-
ets and give all his stuff away. You also may turn right away to substitutes for
the lost loved one, such as a new love in the case of partner loss or a new
puppy or kitten in the case of pet loss.
If you’re trying to help a loved one through his grief, don’t mistake the
absence of obvious emotion as an automatic sign of absent grieving. Some
folks grieve mightily without ever breaking down in public and letting their
feelings show. To count as a case of absent grieving, you have to witness
more symptoms than just a lack of public emotion. The best indicator of
absent grieving remains the tremendous discomfort and reluctance in dis-
cussing anything having to do with the death, the lost loved one, or anything
about the relationship with the deceased.
200
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

People who refuse to grieve do everything they can to put the death behind
them without doing any of the hard work of grieving. Essentially, you’re in
search of a nonexistent quick fix for your pain. The big problem is that even if
you manage to successfully bypass grieving this loss, in due time you’ll expe-
rience another profound loss, and then you’ll have to pay the piper, so to
speak, as the grief from this ungrieved loss arises with that of the new loss.
Instead of grieving a single profound loss (which is hard enough), you have to
contend with the almost overwhelming challenge of grieving multiple losses
at the same time because it’s very normal for a current loss to trigger other
earlier losses, especially when those losses have not been successfully
grieved.
Making sure you’re just too busy to grieve
Another common technique for avoiding the pain involved with grieving the
loss of a loved one is to become too busy to have any time or energy left for
feeling the grief. You have to deal with a lot of financial and legal details fol-
lowing the death of a loved one. Therefore, it’s very natural to become tem-
porarily quite busy dealing with the estate and related affairs soon after the
passing. But what I’m talking about here isn’t just attending to the business
that naturally arises from settling the estate; rather, the problem is avoiding
grieving by throwing yourself into big projects that keep you super occupied
shortly after the death (it’s what I call the Winchester syndrome; see the side-
bar “Mrs. Winchester and her ongoing construction project”).
Projects that keep you from grieving can be anything from getting the family
business or home ready to sell to overseeing extensive home or business
improvements. Often, these projects were planned before the death, so
you’re left to undertake them alone, sometimes in honor of the lost loved one
or as part of the legacy of your relationship.
Becoming too busy to grieve by immersing yourself into one or more of the
projects isn’t especially dangerous as long as you take the time to grieve
when the project winds down. Most often, a person avoiding grieving in this
manner secretly hopes to keep the pain at bay long enough for it to fade com-
pletely. When the pain doesn’t go away, he’s forced to finally confront the
grief or come up with a new strategy of avoidance (which means that this can
become a vicious cycle).
Anesthetizing the pain
Perhaps the most common way to avoid the pain of grieving is to turn to alco-
hol or the use of other drugs to dull the pain. This tendency isn’t surprising
given that the temptation to drown your sorrows exists even when you’re not
suffering a loss anywhere as serious as the death of a loved one.
201
Chapter 12: Troubled Grieving

When you’re suffering something as devastating as a death, the lure of taking
something to dull the pain can be very seductive. Many times, newly bereaved
people aren’t even aware that they’re gravitating toward substances that
anesthetize their constant anguish. All they’re aware of is that they’re in a
pain unlike anything they’ve experienced before and they need relief.
Keep in mind that you may abuse prescribed medications in the same ways
as alcohol and illicit drugs. You may have a great deal of trouble sleeping and
therefore naturally seek out medications from your doctor to help you get the
rest you need. Many prescription sleep medications quickly become habit-
forming if you start relying on them not only to get to sleep but also to help
you get through the pain of your grief.
If you have a newly bereaved friend or family member who you know already
had a predilection for alcohol or any other mind-numbing drug before the
loss, you definitely need to monitor his substance use, especially immedi-
ately after the death. The temptation to drown his sorrows will be strong, and
one weak moment may lead to a downward spiral, especially if his coping
skills aren’t in top form.
This strategy for avoiding grieving may be the most common, but it’s also the
least effective. Many times, instead of dulling the pain, substance use actually
aggravates the pain. This is particularly true in the case of alcohol, which as
a depressant tends to make many people more emotional, not less so.
202
Part II: Experiencing Grief 
Mrs. Winchester and her ongoing 
construction project
After the death of her husband, gun magnate
William Winchester (of the rifle fame), and her
daughter, Annie, Sarah Winchester (1839–1922)
supposedly consulted with a medium who told
her that her family was haunted by the spirits of
those killed by the Winchester rifle and that
Sarah was to move to the West and build a
house for herself and the spirits. Further, the
medium told Sarah that she would die if con-
struction ever ended on the house.
Accordingly, in 1884, Sarah Winchester pur-
chased an eight-room farmhouse in what’s now
San Jose, California. From that point until her
death 38 years later, Winchester’s house in San
Jose was under constant construction and ren-
ovation. (Work went on 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, year-round.) At the time of Win-
chester’s death, the house had more than seven
stories and 160 rooms with many oddities,
including doors that open to walls, staircases
that go nowhere, and windows that overlook
other walls. Today, the Winchester Mystery
House is a museum that’s open to the public.
Now that’s what I call keeping yourself too busy
to grieve!

Therefore, the relief that you get from substance use is extremely fleeting at
best. At worst, this technique actually may make your grief worse as well as
make the grieving process more frightening and daunting than it ever could
have been.
Strategies for Jump-starting 
Your Grieving
The fact that grieving isn’t a linear process that proceeds evenly from start to
finish almost goes without saying. Rather, grieving is a process that goes in
fits and starts and one that more often than not goes every which way but
forward. The suggestions in this section are for people who are having trou-
ble getting on with their grieving or have gotten stuck somewhere in the
process.
Note that stalling at some point in this process isn’t tantamount to develop-
ing an aversion to grieving. It’s also no indication that the process won’t get
going again at some point soon. However, there are some things that you can
do to help jump-start the grieving process and get it back on track.
If you’ve suffered a traumatic loss (see the section “Recognizing Traumatic
Losses,” earlier in this chapter), then you most likely need to seek out profes-
sional help to learn new ways to cope with the trauma that you’ve experi-
enced and lessen its debilitating effects before you can start dealing with the
grief process. Trauma is a condition that’s too serious to ignore, and it’s not
one that you can cure yourself. After you’ve gotten help to deal with the
trauma, you can work on grieving the loss.
Retelling the story of your relationship
Your grieving process may get stuck at a point where your feelings about
your lost loved one or the relationship that you shared with him are com-
pletely ambivalent. Or your process may stall out because you can’t find a
way to get beyond a particular regret, guilt, or even anger that you feel.
When this happens, one way to get beyond these feelings and get the process
back on track is to retell your story. (You can do this in a journal, in a support
group, or even with a friend who’s willing to lend an empathetic ear — see
Chapter 14 for more ideas.)
203
Chapter 12: Troubled Grieving

In telling the story of your relationship many times to many different people,
there’s a good chance that you’ll uncover some new, previously forgotten
details. Especially if you tell your story in a group setting or to another friend
or family member, their questions and comments can trigger you to remem-
ber things.
Moreover, other people’s observations can help you gain a much needed new
perspective on the relationship or an aspect of it. Sometimes this is all you
need in order to gain a new and deeper appreciation of the person and the
relationship you lost. This deeper awareness, in turn, gets the old grief
machine working once again, and you’re able to replace your feelings of
regret, guilt, or anger with feelings of deep longing for your loved one and
deep sorrow for the loss you’ve endured.
Working with the pain creatively
Try getting your grieving process unstuck by getting in touch with your cre-
ative side (and yes, you have one even if you haven’t used it in a long time).
By expressing yourself creatively, you can tap into feelings that you didn’t
even know you had, which can be a real boon when it comes to jump-starting
your grieving process.
Expressing yourself creatively doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to 
“do an art,” although pursuing an artistic discipline can be a very effective
way to get in touch with feelings. You can be creative in any activity that you
undertake — from the most mundane task to the most artsy-fartsy discipline.
Here are some suggestions of creative activities that you can do, or learn to
do, to help you get back in touch with your feelings:
 Write down your feelings about anything and everything in a daily 
journal.
 Write a poem about anything that comes to mind (and it doesn’t even
have to rhyme).
 Paint pictures in oil, watercolor, or acrylic.
 Draw pictures with pencil, charcoal, pastels, colored pens, or even
crayons!
 Sculpt in clay, metal, or wood.
 Do calligraphy, decoupage, or collage.
 Make jewelry or pottery.
204
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

 Do woodworking or beading.
 Cook dishes in your favorite cuisine or learn to cook dishes in an
entirely new cuisine.
 Sew, crochet, knit, or quilt.
 Make music with an instrument or anything you have that makes noise,
sing in a choir, or just listen to your or your loved one’s favorite tunes.
 Take photographs of anything you like or arrange existing photos into
albums.
 Pursue a meditative body movement such as yoga or Taiji (t’ai chi) or a
martial art such karate or tae kwon do (see Chapter 15).
 Create a grief altar, an altar to your patron saint, your ancestors, or
whomever or whatever you hold sacred.
 Design and plant a garden of flowers or plants (use a container or terrar-
ium if you don’t have a yard).
When pursuing any creative activities, remember that you don’t have to use
the activities to overtly express your feelings about your loss. Trust that your
feelings will surface effortlessly in whatever creative activity you undertake.
The idea here isn’t to push yourself back into feeling grief but rather to open
a channel through which grief can naturally flow.
Also, it’s no crime if these creative activities simply give you some much
needed and deserved respite from all the stress and sorrow you’ve had to
deal with. Getting a chance to recharge your batteries after the shock of the
death also helps you get back on track with grieving.
Check out Chapter 14 for information on how to use creative activities such
as the ones suggested here to directly express your feelings about your loss
and help you work through your sorrow.

M
ost people find themselves somewhat tongued-tied with feelings of
helplessness when they’re facing a person who’s suffering acute grief.
That’s what makes finding constructive ways to support someone who’s
actively grieving a profound loss so important.
Feelings of helplessness stem from a number of fears, including:
 The fear that you’ll say something wrong, embarrass yourself, and end
up offending the person you’re trying to support
 The fear that the strength of the emotions engendered by the person’s
loss may “get out of control”
 The fear that the bereaved’s deep emotions will stir something up in you
and you may lose control of your own emotions
 The fear that in trying to support this person’s grief, your own fears and
deep discomfort with death will surface
As I discuss in this chapter, strategies do exist for dealing with any and all
these fears. But in order for these strategies to work, you have to be highly
motivated to help the person who’s grieving. With each of these fears, the
focus is on you instead of on the person who’s actually suffering. So obviously

the first step in helping a bereaved friend or family member is turning the
focus away from you and back onto the person you want to support in this
crucial time of need.
What to Say to Someone in Acute Grief
The first rule to remember about saying the right thing to someone who’s in
intense grief is that there is no “right” thing to say. That being said, there are
a number of rather insensitive platitudes, such as “I know how you’re feeling”
and “It’s all for the best” (see Chapter 20 for a more complete list and discus-
sion of their effects), that I urge you to avoid. They aren’t supportive to the
person in distress, and they tend to stifle the conversation by putting the
person off, which is the last thing you want to do for someone you intend 
to help.
Instead, simply tell the person how sorry you are for his loss. Or, if you’re not
comfortable with that and don’t have any words, simply be honest and tell
him that you don’t know what to say in the face of his sorrow. In most cases,
the bereaved will find such honesty completely refreshing. This is especially
true if he’s been inundated with platitudes or, even worse (far worse), he’s
finding that people have suddenly started going out of their way to avoid
saying anything to him at all.
Don’t give in to the temptation to avoid saying anything to a bereaved
person, mistakenly thinking that it’s better to say nothing at all rather than
risk saying something awkward or inappropriate. No matter how trite and
superficial, any platitude you deliver sincerely is much less hurtful than no
words of support at all. Even in acute grief, people can feel the sincerity in a
comment; from silence, they can only deduce that you don’t care enough for
them to confront your own feelings of discomfort.
If you’ve never suffered a profound loss, you may underestimate how impor-
tant the words, cards, and casseroles of sympathy and support are. Even
though they can’t begin to mitigate the situation, they’re clear signals that
the people suffering the grief aren’t alone. And, believe me, the message that
you’re not alone is an incredibly important one to receive when you’re faced
with a profound loss because alone is often exactly how you feel.
How to Listen to Someone Who’s Grieving
No matter how much you want to take away someone’s pain from grieving 
a profound loss, you need to realize that you can’t. Don’t spend any time
trying. Instead of fretting about a bereaved person’s level of discomfort, 
208
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

concentrate on listening to the bereaved person as he expresses his feelings
about the loss.
Unfortunately, listening isn’t always as easy as it sounds. Most people have
trouble really listening to other people even when they’re expressing essen-
tially positive feelings. When confronted with listening to what you normally
consider negative feelings (sorrow, guilt, anger, and all the rest), it’s easy to
find that you’re in over your head!
Cultivating active listening
One of the basic training techniques designed to help hospice volunteers
really listen to the concerns and feelings of the people they visit and attend
to is called active listening. Despite its name, active listening doesn’t refer to
listening in which you take charge of the conversation. It’s quite the opposite:
Active listening is a technique whereby you do everything possible to help
the other person fully express his or her feelings without regard to your own
feelings.
The key element to active listening is the suspension of judgments, at least 
as far as your verbal responses go. Instead of responding to the bereaved
person by telling him what you think about the feelings he’s expressing
(which may be pretty intense and very dark), you simply ask him what he
thinks about the feelings he’s having. And even when you feel moved to
counter a particular viewpoint or idea, you first acknowledge the person’s
feelings.
For example, suppose your recently bereaved friend tells you that, now that
his wife is dead, he has no reason to go on and wishes only that he were dead
as well. Instead of rushing to buck him up with reasons for going on living,
first acknowledge his feelings and their validity — “Yes, I can really under-
stand how losing her makes you feel right now as though you don’t want to
go on.” After you grant the validity of his feelings, you give him your gentle
advice — “But, you need to keep in mind that even feelings as deep as these
are subject to change, and you may not feel so forlorn in time.”
Keep in mind that your responses have to be genuine. Participating in active
listening doesn’t mean that you have to give up your honest feelings about an
issue. It does mean, however, that you remain aware that the whole point of
the conversation is to enable the other person to express his honest feelings
about the grief — not express how you feel about his loss!
209
Chapter 13: When Someone You Care About Is Suffering Acute Grief

If you feel it’s appropriate in the course of the conversation, you certainly
can tell the other person how a similar experience you had affected you and
how you learned from it, but be careful not to use this as an opportunity to
shift the focus onto yourself and your story. I don’t ever recommend respond-
ing with a hypothetical feeling. In other words, I might tell a bereaved family
member how I dealt with similar feelings I experienced when my mother died,
but I would never tell him how I think I would have felt in I were in his situa-
tion. If I’ve never experienced anything close to what the person is describ-
ing, I don’t have any experiential wisdom to share and therefore have no
business interjecting my two cents; I should just keep my mouth shut and
listen (something that people who know me well know is not all that easy for
me to do!).
At first, you may find active listening quite challenging, especially if you’re
someone with strong opinions who’s quite used to sharing them freely. With
time and some practice, however, you may find it as liberating as I do.
Perhaps this is because I know going into the conversation that my only
requirement is to listen from the heart. I don’t have to have anything in par-
ticular to say; I don’t have to have anything in particular to contribute. All I
have to do is hold the space open for the other person so that he can openly
express his feelings.
Empathizing instead of sympathizing
Listening without judgment is surely one of the most effective ways to hold
the space open for a person to freely express his grief. Another effective
210
Part II: Experiencing Grief 
Coulda, shoulda, woulda and active listening
“Could have,” “should have,” and “would have”
are highfalutin tenses frequently used to express
wished-for states that didn’t come true. In the
world of active listening, they have no place, so
you can just eliminate them from your vocabu-
lary. Unfortunately, the bereaved person you’re
conversing with may have a great need to
express his feelings in any or all of these tenses.
A person’s feelings of guilt over a death are
especially strong in the acute stage of grieving.
So you may hear a lot of feelings expressed as
“He never should have done such and such . . .”
or “If only he would have listened to me, he could
have . . .” and the like. And, as you now know, the
best thing you can do is to just keep the space
open for him to express these kinds of feelings.

method is to convey empathy rather than sympathy in your responses.
What’s the difference, you ask?
 When you empathize with someone, you identify with that person.
 When you sympathize with someone, you feel sorry for the person, and
in turn, you feel for his predicament.
The difference really isn’t in the feelings, their depth, or their sincerity because
in both cases, you may commiserate genuinely with the other person and his
situation. However, in the case of empathy, you’re on the same level (as you
have to be in order to identify with someone else’s situation). In the case of
sympathy (or pity), you can be safely on a different level, and without notic-
ing, the focus can turn to the fact that it’s the other person — and certainly
not you — who’s in the extremely unfortunate situation of grieving the death
of a loved one.
In order to have empathy for another person’s grief, you don’t have to have
experienced the same or a similar type of loss. You simply have to acknowl-
edge fully that grief is the great human common denominator and that,
although today it may be the other person who’s lost a loved one, tomorrow
it may well be you. Seen from this perspective, when you take the time to
support a friend in his grieving by listening to him with your heart, you’re
really doing some of your own grief work.
What to do if your own grief surfaces
Sometimes just hearing someone else talk about his grief (much less express
it emotionally and physically by crying) can trigger your own feelings of sad-
ness over losses you’ve experienced. And it can happen even when you’ve
long since finished actively grieving a loss. So what do you do if your own
feelings of grief surface when listening to someone else express his grief?
When this happens to me, I simply regard it as a part of human empathy that
enables me to connect deeply and communicate with another person about
such issues. You, on the other hand, may have a very different take on it:
Having your own feelings of grief suddenly triggered may make you feel very
vulnerable and more than a little out of control.
The best thing to do in such a situation is to honestly acknowledge that it’s
happening. For example, you might say something like “Your story is affect-
ing me so deeply that it’s put me in touch with my own feelings of grief over
losing . . . .” Of course, if you’re welling up or actually starting to weep, you
may not be able to get any words out. In such a case, it will be plenty evident
211
Chapter 13: When Someone You Care About Is Suffering Acute Grief

that your friend’s words have touched you deeply, although he won’t know
the reason for your tears.
If you find yourself totally overcome with emotion, just excuse yourself and
go off and deal with your own grief (it’s analogous to the airline instruction to
put on your own oxygen mask before attempting to help anyone else put on
theirs). You can always explain the reason for your abrupt departure at a
later time when you’re more in control. No one in the world will be more
understanding than your friend who’s undoubtedly often overcome in a simi-
lar way by his own grief.
Patience as the key
Keep in mind that many times a bereaved person needs to tell his story of
loss again and again. If you’re just a friend trying to support another friend,
you may find it a bit tedious to hear the same story (or parts of it) over and
over again. You also may jump to the conclusion that repeated storytelling
means that your friend is stuck and in need of help in getting on with his life.
Although it appears from the outside as though the bereaved person is stuck
and getting nowhere in telling the same story again and again, most often
that isn’t the case. Chances are good that he’s working his way through the
meaning of the loss or a certain stage of it (see Chapter 11 for details) as he
goes over and over a particular incident or string of incidents involving the
lost loved one.
In fact, if you have enough patience to sit with your friend through the telling
and retelling of the same story, you may be surprised (pleasantly, of course)
to find that, suddenly, one day your friend is done with the story and has
absolutely no need to revisit it with you again. He’s worked out whatever he
needed to work out in the retelling (and, perhaps, rehearing) of the story, and
he’s ready to move on.
The challenge for you, the listener, is to manifest sufficient patience. Some-
times it’s all too tempting to want to move things along after you’ve heard
what sounds like exactly the same story over and over again. You may think
that, now that you’ve heard your friend relate the same thing for the umpteenth
time, it’s high time to ditch active listening in favor of a more focused agenda
that will move him along in his grieving. Again, I urge you to avoid the temp-
tation to do anything more than support a bereaved friend through active lis-
tening. If you find that your patience has run out, it’s clearly time to gently
move your friend toward professional help.
212
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

A professional grief counselor should be able to ascertain quickly where your
friend is in his grief process. She’ll also be able to determine whether your
friend is stuck in a certain grieving stage or simply taking his own sweet time
working through a particular part of the process.
If listening is not your forte
Not everybody is capable of listening (actively or not) to another person
express his innermost thoughts and feelings about grief. If you’re one of these
people, don’t feel at all bad about it. You probably know that you aren’t ca-
pable of this kind of listening because you’d rather have a root canal than sit
for an hour supporting a grieving friend. If, however, you don’t recognize this
inability before you attempt to listen, you’ll discover your mistake quickly
enough; in the course of the conversation, you’ll find yourself very tense and
emotionally shut down, having trouble hearing what your friend is saying, or
you’ll become impatient and maybe just a tad irritated at being subjected to
these strong emotions.
If comforting a friend in acute grief isn’t your strong suit, accept that and
make every attempt to get the bereaved friend connected to someone who
can provide comfort and attention (such as a professional grief counselor or
support group as described in Chapter 14).
213
Chapter 13: When Someone You Care About Is Suffering Acute Grief
The challenge of working with 
the dying and bereaved
Like many who work in hospice and end-of-life
care, I’m regularly asked how I can do the kind
of work that I do. It’s tantamount to asking how
I can handle working with the dying and griev-
ing without being weighed down by it. The
simple answer is that once I mastered active lis-
tening (and it took some time and loads of prac-
tice), carrying on conversations with people
who were dying or grieving deaths became a
whole lot easier and much less draining. In fact,
I often find these heart-to-heart conversations
uplifting and much less taxing than normal,
seemingly more superficial conversations
because they’re so honest and because the
spotlight’s not on me and I’m not required to fix
anything (which is not always the case in my
regular day-to-day affairs).
Also, through my experience with people in
acute grief (myself and others I’ve supported),
I’ve come to realize that every person is quite
capable of seeing his or her way through the
pain of grief. Often, all they need is a way to tell
their stories, express their grief, and be heard.

This pithy advice is all well and good provided that a dear friend isn’t in
acute crisis over his grief and you’re seemingly the only one around who he
can reach. In that situation, you have no choice but to tough it out and listen
as best you can, however difficult you may find it. (Try looking at the situa-
tion from your friend’s perspective: He didn’t ask for this loss and probably
feels totally unprepared to deal with the grief that comes from it.)
The best way to make it through a difficult support situation is to keep
reminding yourself that you’re not responsible in any way for making the situa-
tion better or for taking away your friend’s pain. Your only job is to enable
your friend to express his feelings and tell his story. Perhaps most important
of all, keep in mind that listening to and even empathizing with another’s pain
doesn’t entail taking that pain onto yourself. You’re not there to shoulder a
friend’s pain but to help him shoulder it himself (and just being willing to
listen is often a very effective way to do this).
Other Ways to Support 
a Bereaved Friend
Although I spend a great deal of space in this chapter discussing ways to
effectively listen to a bereaved friend, I don’t want you to take away the mis-
taken impression that talking is necessarily the best way to support your
friend through acute grief. Regardless of the benefit, some people aren’t able
to discuss their feelings or aren’t comfortable doing so. Moreover, in the first
stage of grief, they may be in too much shock or denial over the death to be
in touch with their feelings, let alone ready to share them.
If you’re helping a friend through his grief, keep in mind these general 
guidelines:
 Talk when it’s time to talk. Always follow the bereaved person’s lead. If
he wants to talk, talk. If he’s reticent to talk, be quiet. Just realize that
your presence and willingness to be with him in his pain is often the
best support that you can give him.
 Help out when talk isn’t required. If you aren’t particularly comfortable
with silence (not all of us are Zen trained), you may want to ascertain
what, if any, chores you can perform to help out. This may be something
as simple as helping organize your friend’s mail, cooking him a few meals,
or chauffeuring him around.
 Be available. Supporting your friend may entail doing nothing other
than being prepared to be there or to talk should the need arise. In that
214
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

case, check in, preferably by telephone, on a regular basis to see how
your friend is and to ascertain whether there’s anything you can do 
to help.
Like people who are actively dying, people who are in acute grief never
know where they’ll be emotionally at any given moment, much less from
one day to the next. When you call to check in, be aware that you could
catch your friend at almost any point on the emotional spectrum. There-
fore, don’t expect that, just because your friend sounded genuinely okay
when you talked on Monday, he’ll be in that state on Tuesday or vice
versa. Try your darnedest not to anticipate — simply ask where he is at
the time you actually make contact.
Often, at the time of the funeral and shortly thereafter, the bereaved almost
has too many people checking in on him to find out how they can help. This
support soon disappears, though, and the bereaved is left all alone to fend
for himself. This is the time when you really need to remember to pick up the
phone and check in and let your friend know that you’re there for him and
that he’s certainly not alone.
Being Sensitive to the Factors 
That Affect Grieving
In trying to support anyone who’s grieving, keep in mind the obvious fact
that everybody grieves in their own ways. And there are a bunch of factors
that can affect the way a person grieves. Among the most important are
 Type and nature of the relationship to the lost loved one
 Manner of the loss (for example, sudden versus expected or preventable
versus inevitable)
 Accumulation of losses and experience with profound grief
 Personality of the bereaved person
 Culture of the bereaved person
This section looks at each of these factors with an eye toward how they work
together to affect how someone grieves and how you can support a friend in
his time of need.
215
Chapter 13: When Someone You Care About Is Suffering Acute Grief

The type and nature of the relationship
In Chapter 1, I suggest that the depth of the grief one undergoes is a direct
function of the nature of the loss suffered. By this I don’t mean that it’s
simply a question of the type of loss one endures — loss of a parent, child,
sibling, friend, or pet; rather, the depth of grief also is related to the particu-
lar relationship that the person built up with his loved one.
For example, the death of a parent with whom your friend was close through-
out every stage of his life can be expected to affect him far more deeply than
the loss of an estranged parent whom he really never knew and who was
unfortunately seldom or never an active part of his life. So too, the death of
someone’s best friend from childhood can be expected to affect a person far
more deeply than the loss of a friend at work with whom he was just starting
to become close.
When supporting someone in his grief, it’s not enough to simply know who
he’s lost. You also have to know the nature of the person’s relationship with
that loved one. In the case of a close friend whom you’re trying to support,
you may already know quite a bit about the nature of this relationship.
No matter how much you think you may know about the nature of a friend’s
relationship with the lost loved one, you owe it to everyone concerned to
check out your assumptions. Often, information about the relationship comes
out as a natural part of the storytelling that your friend engages in as part of
his grief process. Sometimes, however, you may find that your friend’s story
is oddly devoid of this type of concrete information and you have no choice
but to question him about it.
The manner of the loss
The manner of the loss can influence the depth of your friend’s grief (see
Chapter 2). Expect your experience supporting your friend through his acute
stages of grief to differ greatly according to whether the loss was sudden or
anticipated:
 In the case of a sudden loss, your friend will be experiencing a great deal
of shock and numbness. And you may hear more anger, recrimination,
and perhaps even guilt expressed before this initial shock wears off and
you start hearing stories about the relationship with the loved one, its
depth, and how this loss is affecting him.
 In the case of an anticipated loss, your friend may have had to experi-
ence the decline and loss of his loved one’s abilities. And you may hear
many stories describing the extent and depth of his relationship with
the loved one, with very little mulling over the manner of death after
expressing the pain associated with having to witness this decline.
216
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

The effect of accumulated losses 
and grief experience
The older you get, the more losses and battle scars you naturally accumulate
(hey, that gray hair has to stand for something). The first time you go through
the grieving process, you aren’t at all sure that the pain will ever end or that,
if it does end, you’ll make it through in one piece. The next time you experi-
ence profound grief, you still may not be sure how intense it will be or long it
will last, but you’re a little more certain that it will eventually end and you’ll
survive it.
Although grieving doesn’t necessarily get any easier with experience, the
process does become more predictable. And out of this familiarity can come
some self-knowledge about how best to go about handling the process and
even working through it more effectively.
Supporting someone grieving a first big loss
When trying to support a friend who has little or no previous experience with
the grieving process and how to handle it, one of his overriding concerns is
likely to be his ability to withstand the terrible pain and survive the process.
Other important worries that you may hear about may include whether he’s
going crazy and whether the pain will ever go away and the grieving come 
to end (as in “Will I feel this bad all the rest of my life?” and “Will this pain
ever end?”).
When discussing such fears with your friend — in active listening mode, 
of course (refer to the earlier section “How to Listen to Someone Who’s
Grieving”) — don’t rush to reassure him that he’s unquestionably strong
enough to withstand the pain of this grief, that he’s definitely not going crazy,
and that yes, all this pain will ultimately end. Instead, consider using these
steps:
1. Let him know that you hear all his fears by actually mirroring each
one of them back to him.
For example, say, “I hear that you’re afraid that you’re not going to be
strong enough to get through the pain you’re suffering now, that you’re
feeling like you’re going crazy, and that you’re very concerned that this
grief might never end.”
2. Tell your grieving friend that you understand how he could have
these feelings given the loss he’s just suffered (provided you honestly
feel this way).
217
Chapter 13: When Someone You Care About Is Suffering Acute Grief

3. Consider telling him that you read in a book on grieving (decide for
yourself whether telling him that it was a For Dummies book will help
or hurt your cause!) that it’s not unusual for people dealing with the
profound loss of a loved one at first to feel so overwhelmed by the
depth of their feelings and sadness that they naturally doubt their
ability to withstand the pain. They also often worry that they’re going
crazy and are deeply concerned about whether or not the grieving
process will ever come to an end so they can feel connected to life
once again.
Supporting someone who’s grieved multiple losses
You may get the impression that supporting a friend who has had multiple
experiences with grief is bound to be easier than supporting someone who’s
grieving his first profound loss. Actually, one isn’t necessarily easier than the
other — it really depends upon how well your friend has handled each griev-
ing experience.
If your friend has had the time and the courage to grieve each loss, then you
may expect him to understand how he deals with the grieving process and
have fewer qualms about surviving it. However, this doesn’t mean that past
grieving experiences are always good indicators of how one will deal with the
next loss.
Even if your friend deems the present loss he’s grieving to be somewhat
minor when compared to some of those he has experienced in the past, the
present loss may stir up extremely deep sorrow. The present loss becomes a
vivid reminder of all the profound losses he’s had, and he ends up grieving
not only this loss but also those of the past.
Of course, your friend may be a person who hasn’t dealt completely with all
his past losses for a number of reasons. He may not have given himself suffi-
cient time to grieve all his past losses. He may even have experienced multi-
ple simultaneous losses or losses compacted within a very short time frame,
so he simply didn’t have the time to grieve each loss as thoroughly as he other-
wise would have done.
Whatever the reasons, your friend’s present loss may trigger unresolved grief
from past losses that gets mixed in with the grief for the current one. You
may even find that he starts talking about and expressing sorrow for past
losses before he’s able to deal with the sorrow caused by the present one.
When supporting someone who has dealt with accumulated losses, under-
stand that you may end up listening to more than just his stories about the
loved one he’s just lost. Indeed, at least for a while, you may hear more about
218
Part II: Experiencing Grief 

other loved ones long gone and emotions that their passing stirs up than you
hear about the person recently deceased.
Provided that you’re supporting your friend with active listening (and there-
fore without any agenda), his mixing of losses and grief should present no
particular problem. Just keep in mind that his expressions of sorrow and feel-
ings for past losses are all necessary in order for him to get to and properly
process the present loss. In fact, not having someone like you who was will-
ing to listen to his stories about past losses may be part of the reason that he
still needs to tell them.
Personality and grieving
Think about the personalities of your friends: Some are probably naturally
more outgoing and open with their emotions than others who are naturally
more reserved and tend to keep tighter control over their emotions. A ten-
dency toward a more or less extroverted show of emotions often is an indica-
tor of how openly a friend will express his sorrow to you during grieving.
However, it’s no indicator of how deep his grief is over the loss or how long
the acute phase of grieving will go on.
Helping extroverted people
When dealing with a friend who’s naturally more expressive with his emo-
tions, you may find that he has a relatively easy time opening up to you and
expressing his feelings about his grief. Note that this may not be the case if
your friend becomes concerned that, once he starts outwardly expressing
grief (especially by crying), he won’t be able to stop.
The fear of not being able to ever stop crying is quite a big concern for some
people, especially when they first start grieving. Dealing with this fear can
run the gamut from blocking the show of all emotions to just having a much
harder time opening up. If a friend expresses this concern to you, you can
safely reassure him that, although he feels sad enough to cry forever, his
body will naturally stop when it runs out of tears. Also let him know that he’s
safe to let it all out with you (provided that’s the way you really feel).
Helping introverted people
When dealing with a friend who naturally tends to keep a tighter rein on his
emotions, you may find that he has a relatively difficult time opening up to
you and expressing his feelings of grief. Of course, that’s fine, and you should
tell him so. In fact, he may find that your acceptance of his reluctance to
share and show emotion eventually makes him feel comfortable enough to
open up and unburden himself.
219
Chapter 13: When Someone You Care About Is Suffering Acute Grief

A person’s openness or lack of it in expressing sorrow over a loss is no indi-
cator of how deeply he’s grieving. It only shows how comfortable he is pub-
licly expressing his grief, and this comfort level is often just a function of the
person’s gender (on the whole, men have a harder time sharing feelings than
women), socialization (some families and cultures are more stoic than
others), and personality (extroverts are more open than introverts).
Culture and grieving
It’s not only your personality but also the culture in which you’re brought up
that influences how easily and openly you express your grief. Some cultures
naturally encourage public mourning and grieving for the dead (especially at
the time of the funeral), whereas other cultures tend to frown upon public
displays of grief and encourage people to mourn the dead in much more pri-
vate and discreet manners. (For some specific examples of cultural influences
on grieving, turn to Chapter 17.)
When trying to support a grieving friend who’s been brought up in a culture
different from your own, you may have some trouble understanding his
responses to his grief. Ask him directly about the mourning practices of his
native culture and/or family. If he’s open and willing to discuss this subject,
the information can go a long way toward helping you understand his
response to the loss. It also may be the case that, by discussing his culture’s
or family’s expectations and norms surrounding death, dying, and grieving,

In this part . . .
H
ealing the grief you suffer from the profound loss of
a loved one is often a long and challenging task. In
this part, you find out how to support the process of heal-
ing through appropriate ways of expressing your grief.
You also get a chance to investigate the physical aspects
of grief and how you can use physical activities as tools to
help you in healing. Finally, you’re given some tips for
developing strategies to help you through the pain and
heartache that inevitably accompany the holidays and
anniversaries after the loss of a loved one.

In This Chapter
 Knowing that your grief isn’t atypical
 Exploring ways to express your grief
 Releasing your grief so that you can move past it
 Turning to others for grief support
E
xpressing your grief is really at the heart of the grieving process. By find-
ing ways to express your grief, you’re able to release the intense pain
over time. And from there, you can begin to move from acknowledging the
loss and all that it means to you to incorporating it into the rest of your life.
The chapter begins by examining some of the more typical ways you may
experience the pain of grieving, especially at its outset soon after the death. I
share typical strategies that you may want to use to help you communicate
and get your feelings out; they include finding your own way to express your
grief, grieving with others who are mourning the same loss, and expressing
your grief through creative or artistic activities.
The chapter concludes with a look at various ways that you can get help in
dealing with the pain of the grief and getting yourself through it, including
relying upon the sympathetic ear of someone who’s not mourning the same
loss and can listen to you and seeking out professional help from a grief coun-
selor or grief support group. This discussion covers how to locate grief coun-
seling resources in your local area and how to choose between one-on-one
counseling and a support group. Regarding grief support groups, I tell you
how to choose the right support group for you and what to expect and what
not to expect from the group experience.
Typical Grief Experiences
It may strike you as a bit odd to have a discussion about typical grief experi-
ences. After all, isn’t the entire grieving experience such a personal affair that
the likelihood of typical experiences is pretty slim?

Strangely enough, although the grieving process is one of the most intensely
personal experiences you can go through, there are some very general grief
experiences that are common to most people’s grieving. In this section, I
review three of the more pervasive grief experiences, namely:
 Grief seems like an interminable experience that you fear will never end.
 Grief isolates you and makes you feel more alone than ever before in
your life.
 You’re plagued by remorse over not having had the chance to express all
your feelings to your loved one before he died, adding to your grief and
making it much worse.
Will this pain never end?
Grieving is really scary business for most people. And one of the most fright-
ful things about grief is that it seems quite simply that the pain and misery
will never end.
I think this fear may account in part for why so many bereaved people are
reluctant to get in touch with and show their sorrow: They fear that once
they start getting in touch with this profound pain, the feelings of sorrow will
pull them under and they’ll never again be able to resurface.
Yes, the pain will end
I know that it feels like the pain of your grief will never end and the grieving
will go on forever. I’m here to reassure you that it will end: Grieving is a natural
human process and not some crime that carries a mandatory life sentence.
Go directly through the pain and don’t try to put it off or avoid it. By feeling
the pain as deeply as you need to, you hasten the day when you’ll be released
from your grief. Trying to hold back the emotions or ignore the pain altogether
only slows down the grieving process and makes it last even longer.
But sometimes the grief comes back
Just as it’s imperative that you understand that one day you’ll wake up and
the intense pain of the grief will be gone, it’s also very important to under-
stand that this doesn’t mean that you’ll never be plagued by such intense
grief again. It’s not at all uncommon to feel pretty okay with the loss (or at
least not devastated by it) and then suddenly relapse into sorrow as intense
as when you first grieved the loss. Grief professionals even have a term for
this relapse: Sudden Temporary Upsurge of Grief, or STUG.
It’s exactly what the name says — a sudden and temporary upsurge of grief. 
A STUG is often triggered by a stimulus (such as a special scent, sound, 
224
Part III: Healing Grief 

environment, an anniversary date, or even something that you’re not even
aware of) that reminds you of your lost loved one or the relationship you
shared. The nice thing about a STUG is that it reconnects you to your lost
loved one, and the pain that it brings, although intense, doesn’t last.
The most important thing to remember when a STUG tugs at your heart is
that it’s not a signal that you’re about to fall back into your original grief and
have to do all your grieving work again. Grieving definitely isn’t a game of
Chutes and Ladders where, when you fall down, you have to start all over
again to climb back up.
Never felt so alone
Grieving can be a tremendously isolating experience, one in which you feel
totally alone and abandoned. This is true even when you’re surrounded by
family and friends who you know are there to support you every step of the
way. Of course the feeling of being alone is stronger when you don’t have this
kind of support system to help you.
Facing the isolation
Grieving feels isolating in large part because you’ve just had a loved one
taken from you, and all you want is the impossible — to have him back again.
In these circumstances, you may understandably feel totally bereft (ripped
off) and quite forsaken. This can be the case regardless of whether your
loved one’s death was anticipated or sudden and completely unexpected.
Being separated by death from someone you love is nothing like being sepa-
rated in any other way. Not matter how much you may believe that you’ll be
reunited with your loved one in the world to come, you know (or are coming
to realize) that you’ll never see him again in this world. For all the rest of
your days on this earth, however many or few they be, you’ll be forever with-
out that loved one.
Turning isolation into a positive
Isolation is an integral part of the grieving process for most bereaved people.
A certain amount of seclusion and privacy can enable you to express your
grief more freely and gives you an opportunity to contemplate the meaning of
the relationship and consequently the meaning of the loss.
This contemplation is a part of the process of fully acknowledging the loss
(the first task in the grieving process, as I explain in Chapter 1). This task
doesn’t simply entail finally giving up on the denial stage in which your mind
refuses to accept that the death is real and that your loved one won’t ever be
coming through that door again. Rather, acknowledging the loss also involves
formulating a response to this hard reality, what some people refer to as making
225
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

meaning of the death. At first, this response can be no more than expressing
all the grief that this loss brings you. But in time, this response can grow to
embrace new ways of staying connected to your lost loved one and incorpo-
rating the love you shared with him in your new life (see Chapter 18 for more
on incorporating the loss).
Dr. Phil (McGraw) never tires of telling his guests on his popular TV show:
“You can’t fix what you don’t own.” In this instance, owning or acknowledging
the death is more than a precondition to healing the grief — it’s part and
parcel of the healing process itself.
Never got a chance to say goodbye
One of the most prevalent regrets that bereaved people have is not having
had an adequate chance to say goodbye to their loved ones before they died.
This regret plagues both those whose loved ones die sudden and unexpected
deaths and many whose loved ones die long-anticipated deaths.
You can feel this regret even if you were at the bedside of your loved one
until the moment of his death, profusely proclaiming your love and how
much the relationship has meant to you. No matter how much opportunity
you have to actually say goodbye to your loved one, you may never feel as
though you had enough time to express yourself.
I think that the principal reason for this feeling is that saying goodbye isn’t so
much a part of attending to dying loved ones as it is part of grieving the loss
of them. Therefore, having all the chance in the world to declare your devo-
tion before your loved one passes away will never be a real substitute for
saying goodbye to him after the death.
You can still say goodbye
You may not have to live in utter regret about not having the chance to say
goodbye to your loved one if you were suddenly parted from him. You may
be able to come to terms with this regret as part of figuring out how you’re
going to say goodbye as part of grieving this loss.
My process for saying goodbye as part of your grieving includes the follow-
ing tasks:
 Create a list of all the things that you’re already missing with your loved
one gone.
 Add any things that you’re pretty sure you’re going start missing about
him over time.
226
Part III: Healing Grief 

 Add all the things that you don’t and won’t miss.
 List everything that you learned from your loved one.
 List all the ways you’re a better person because your loved one was in
your life.
 Express your gratitude for all you’ve learned and all he’s given before
you say your farewell (as in “till we meet again”).
That’s a good start toward saying goodbye and one that you’ll undoubtedly
add to and improve upon as you move through the rest of your grieving and
uncover ways to express your grief (see the later section “Expressing Your
Grief” for suggestions).
Being a little late doesn’t matter
If you’re concerned that saying your goodbyes after the death of a loved one
just isn’t the same as saying them before he dies, I invite you to approach the
matter in a slightly different way. Even if you did get the chance to say some-
thing at the bedside, you were probably much too upset to express even a
fraction of how much the person means to you and how much you’ll miss
him. This means that you still have to go through this important little exer-
cise by which you come to understand all that your loved one meant to you
and therefore all that you’ve lost in his passing. This understanding turns out
to be not only your goodbye to your loved one but also your admission of all
the grief you carry and have to express as part of grieving the loss.
Expressing Your Grief
Finding appropriate ways to express your grief is one of the most important
tasks in grieving a profound loss. In giving fitting expression to all the feelings
you have regarding the loss, you can gradually let go of the pain.
Note that I prefer to use the phrase “express your grief” rather than “experi-
ence or feel your grief.” Express has plenty of meanings, all of which have
some relevance to this topic; they include:
 Depict or delineate, as in finding ways to describe your grief
 State, utter, or vent, as in finding ways to release your grief
 Show or signify, as in finding ways to display your grief
 Recount or describe, as in finding ways to share your grief
 Symbolize, reflect, or embody, as in finding ways to understand what
this grief means to the rest of your life
227
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

As you can see from this list, when it comes to expressing grief, I’m not simply
talking about getting in touch with feelings such as anger or sadness and find-
ing efficient ways to release them. Although getting in touch and releasing
feelings are definitely ways of expressing the grief you feel (and important
things to do), I’m talking about doing more. Use the expression of your grief
not only as a means of letting go of some of the sadness but also as a means
of telling the story of the relationship you shared with your loved one.
Using expression in this way lets you relieve some of the physical and emo-
tional stress you’re under and helps you gain some insight into what the loss
means to the bigger picture of your life. Most important, as your sadness nat-
urally diminishes through the expression of your grief over time, your under-
standing of how you’ll reconcile the loss to the rest of your life increases.
There are probably as many different ways to express your grief as there are
individual bereaved people. That said, I invite you to consider these general
approaches to expressing grief:
 Expression through ritual: Ritual can open channels through which you
release your sorrow and become able to share it with others.
 Expression through creative activities: Creative activities can open
channels through which you can describe your sorrow and explore its
depths.
 Expression through sharing your feelings and stories with trusted
people: Talking with others who understand and empathize with your
situation can be most beneficial and very healing.
Expressing grief through your own rituals
A ritual is any ceremony that progresses in established steps. Although
people generally think of ritual in the context of formalized religion, it need
not be. You can (and probably do) make a ritual out of the smallest and most
mundane acts in your everyday life, such as getting ready for work in the
morning, preparing the evening meal, or getting ready for bed at night.
To develop your own grief ritual, all you have to do is figure out the following
three things:
 Place: Select a clear, clean space in a room where you can erect some
sort of grief memorial or shrine. If possible, choose a room where any
noise you make won’t disturb the neighbors.
 Time: Select a time when you can devote yourself totally to remem-
brance of your loved one.
228
Part III: Healing Grief 

 Activities: Select a prayer, inspirational reading, piece of music, or poem
that you can recite or play when opening and closing the ritual, and then
fill the middle of the ritual with whatever it is you need to articulate and
convey at the moment you conduct the ritual.
Creating a shrine
When setting up the grief memorial or shrine, adopt an attitude of loving care
and great awareness as you select and arrange each element.
You may want to add pictures of your loved one along with some personal or
natural objects that remind you of him. Personal objects can include effects
such as jewelry; awards and trophies; caps, hats, and other clothing; and
even favorite books (especially a loved one’s Bible or missal). Natural objects
can include anything you have at hand, such as rocks (which you can deco-
rate), shells and sand if you live near a beach, and bird nests (abandoned, of
course) and branches from the back yard. And if it feels right, you also can
add candles, incense, and flowers to the memorial.
Choosing activities
When selecting activities for your grief ritual, I suggest that you pick one
inspirational verse, poem, or song that you use each time you open the ritual
and another that you use each time you close the ritual. That way, you have
two established steps that you can rely on to mark both the beginning of the
ritual and its end.
Even if you’re not particularly musically inclined, you may want to release
some energy by making your own sound for the ritual. If you don’t have a
musical instrument, you can use anything that makes noise — from an empty
cereal box for percussion and an empty bottle as a wind instrument. And if
you can’t find something to use as an instrument, don’t forget your voice. You
can always recite words as a chant even if you can’t carry a tune.
Performing a ceremony
Before starting the ceremony, take a few deep breaths to center yourself.
Don’t worry if you break down in tears at this point or any other during the
ritual. After all, this ceremony is all about expressing your grief as openly and
freely as possible, whenever you need to.
After opening the ritual, play the middle activities completely by ear. Sometimes
you may need to communicate something to your loved one, and other times
you may have nothing particular to say but have a great need to release pent-
up emotions.
229
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

When you need to communicate, speak the words out loud or meditate on
the thoughts silently. When you need to release your emotions, don’t hold
back. Yell, scream, whine, and cry as much as you need to. If you’re feeling a
great deal of anger as part of your grief, keep pillows nearby that you can
pummel as you rail against whomever or whatever you hold responsible for
your woeful situation.
You don’t have to conduct your grief rituals all alone (unless you want or
need to). This is a perfect time to share your grief with others, especially
other friends and family members who are also grieving the same loss. If you
share your ritual with others, they may find it a great comfort if you allow
each person to relate something about your lost loved one, such as a descrip-
tion, story, or vignette (and yes, it’s okay to include a funny story and have a
laugh amid your tears).
Conduct your grief rituals and keep your memorial up as long as you need to
use it. At some point when you’re ready and your grief is finally subsiding,
you will want to conclude your grief rituals. At that time, you may or may not
want to dismantle the memorial as well. If you do decide to dismantle it, after
concluding the final ritual, take down the memorial or shrine with the same
loving care with which you erected it.
Expressing your grief creatively
Everyone’s an artist in their own way. Some are good with words. Others
have really vivid imaginations and are particularly gifted with visual images.
Still others have an excellent sense of rhythm and stand out musically.
It doesn’t matter in what area your gift lies or even whether you’ve let it lie
idle for quite some time. You can draw upon anything in your artistic side to
help you express your grief and, in the process, hopefully end up not only fur-
thering your artistic sensibility but maybe even your artistic abilities.
Three major creative areas have great potential for the expression of grief: writ-
ing, the visual arts, and music. Within each of these areas, you can find dozens
of ways to express your sorrow, tell your story, and begin to heal your grief.
Note: I purposely don’t include primarily somatic activities such as drama,
dance, athletics, and other disciplines for exercising and developing the body
in this section. They’re certainly creative activities, but I cover some of them
in Chapter 15 in my discussion of the physical aspects of grief.
By their very nature, creative activities are both intuitive and experiential.
This means that you need to let yourself go and let the creative process take
over. Doing this makes it a great deal easier to get in touch with and then
230
Part III: Healing Grief 

convey your feelings and also to discover how it is that you can exist outside
the sorrow that has gripped your heart.
Using writing and words
Most of the writing you and I do aims to convey messages in the most clear
and unambiguous way possible. When you’re writing as a means for express-
ing your grief, however, you may want to forgo this very analytic approach in
favor of adopting a more open, nonlinear, and poetic style.
Favor expressiveness in your writing at the expense of the content. In other
words, it doesn’t matter so much what you write as that you write from your
heart. Obviously, your writings may center on your loved one and the rela-
tionship you shared, but your grief will also show through even if you’re writ-
ing about something completely unrelated.
When thinking about topics to write about (either in prose or poetry), con-
sider the following prompts:
 One of the best times I shared with you is . . .
 The first time I ever laid eyes on you, I . . .
 Your love is like . . .
 Life without you is like . . .
 The place where I want to you meet next is . . .
 Here’s what I’ll miss most: . . .
 Here’s what’s going on with me now: . . .
Explore your own topic ideas and add them to this list. At times, you may be
too vulnerable emotionally to tackle some of these topics, but that doesn’t
really matter. In time, as your sorrow subsides, I guarantee that you’ll tackle
all these topics and more — either on paper or just in your head.
If you’re not into poetry and writing essays reminds you just a tad too much
of being back in school, try keeping a journal instead. Daily or even weekly
journaling (or whenever you can manage it) is great because it captures your
feelings on a regular basis and therefore enables you to chart your ups and
downs over time. Journaling is also great because you can write as much or
as little in each entry as your time and energy allow.
Using visual art and imagination
You’ve probably heard that old Chinese saying “A picture’s worth 10,000
words.” (Interestingly, this comes from a culture in which written words are
all just little pictures!) If this adage is true and you have a knack for any kind
231
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

of visual art (and there are plenty of them), you may find art to be one of the
most efficient and satisfying ways to express your grief.
Visual art works so well for bereaved people of all ages (despite the fact that
many grief professionals think of art only as a tool for grieving children).
Visual arts enable you to convey emotions for which you have no words and
sometimes reveal areas of pain and strength that you didn’t know were there.
The other great thing is that some visual arts, such as watercolor painting
and brush painting (and finger painting too, for that matter), require a great
deal of spontaneity. You don’t have the chance to overwork or overthink the
execution of the piece, so you may be able to more easily reach and release
submerged feelings.
Even visual arts such as photography that can require a lot of manual set-
tings as well as a goodly amount of specialized skill in the end rely upon pure
intuition in knowing what shot to go for and exactly when to take it.
Whatever visual art you practice, pursue it with as open a mind and heart as
you can muster. Forgive all your mistakes and don’t bother to judge the end
results (it really doesn’t matter if all your artwork ultimately gets consigned
to the garbage heap). Concentrate solely on the process, and welcome all the
stumbling blocks and impediments you encounter. You’ll undoubtedly open
yourself to many of the feelings of frustration and helplessness that your
grief has brought to your life. By facing down these demons as they arise in
the creative process, you may have half a chance of exorcising them from the
rest of your life.
Using music and sound
Music is an extremely effective way of getting in touch with and giving voice
to your grief. This goes for both the making of music, which includes playing
instruments, singing, chanting, and listening to music as well.
You’ve probably had the experience of being transported to another place
when listening to a particularly beautiful piece of music as well as being
deeply moved emotionally during the experience. Music’s ability to transport
and move is what makes it such an effective grieving tool.
When selecting the music you want to make or listen to, choose music that
uplifts you and transports you to some place out of time and space.
When selecting music that moves you, you have a choice between musical
pieces that literally move you (in other words, inspire you to move rhythmi-
cally or to sing or dance along) and those that move you emotionally (most
232
Part III: Healing Grief 

often to tears, especially when grieving). Of course, some music may move
you both literally and emotionally.
Releasing Your Grief
The emotion most commonly associated with grief is sorrow — a profound
and almost unending sadness over the loss. Although sorrow is the most
common grief emotion, it’s by no means the only one that bereaved people
feel. They often have strong feelings of guilt, anger, and helplessness, too.
Sometimes these other dark emotions overshadow the sorrow in your griev-
ing. When this is the case, I think it wise to deal with these emotions first so
that they can’t taint or derail the feelings of sadness that are at the heart of
the grief.
In time, as your grieving comes to its end, your sense of deep sorrow dissi-
pates, becoming a kind of sadness that’s not so bad that you can’t live with it.
You need to understand, however, that this residual sadness may never go
away, and you may have to live with it for the rest of your life. I like to think of
this sadness as a kind of badge of courage (like the one the Lion got from the
Wizard of Oz) that you wear always. It serves as a reminder that, although
you do survive your grief over the loss, you never overcome missing the love
you shared.
Dealing with feelings of 
anger and helplessness
I think of the relationship between helplessness, fear, and anger in this way:
Fear’s the mastermind of anger and helplessness is the mastermind of fear,
and experiencing the death of a loved one is the quintessence of human help-
lessness. You first stand powerless to save your loved one from death, and
then you’re equally powerless to avoid the sorrow that comes from that loss.
You don’t have to be what people offhandedly refer to as a “control freak” to
be shaken to your very core by this degree of vulnerability. This is probably
why so many bereaved people are as angry about the death as they are sad.
Naturally, because people like to think of themselves as “reasonable” beings,
they spend lots of time finding good reasons for their anger. Instead of spend-
ing time on that, I think they’d probably be a lot better off simply admitting
233
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

that the helplessness they feel as a result of the loss threatens them as noth-
ing has before and that in the face of this threat, they’re really angry.
Given the tight little bond between anger, fear, and helplessness, there are a
couple of good and effective ways to deal with the anger that may come up
when grieving:
 Find safe ways to vent and release your anger.
 Find ways to feel less helpless and more in control while grieving.
Venting anger safely
Anger is the epitome of a volatile or explosive emotion. As such, you need to
find a safe and appropriate way to vent and release this emotion.
If you don’t vent your anger properly, you run the risk of striking out blindly,
hurting and alienating friends and family who are not in any way responsible
and who you really need on your side in this time of sorrow. If you don’t vent
the anger at all, it has this nasty little habit of turning on you and eating you
up inside.
Venting anger without hurting yourself or anybody else is relatively easy.
Here are some suggestions of ways to release anger both when you’re all on
your own and when you’re with other people:
 Gather together old pillows or string up a punching bag and have at it.
 Drive out to an isolated but safe part of the countryside or a vacant part
of town, get out of your car, and yell your head off until you’re hoarse.
 Participate in a martial arts class such as karate or tae kwon do and
empower the movements with the energy from your anger.
 Take a particularly strenuous exercise class at your local gym and use all
your anger to tough it out and make it through.
 Take a brisk walk to the park or around the block.
Feeling more in control when grieving
The best way I know to feel less helpless in the face of grief is to exercise
some personal control over the grieving process. Decide that although you
weren’t given any choice in being bereaved, you’re going to have a choice in
how you grieve the death.
Anything you can do that enables you to fully express the emotions you feel
without constantly being overwhelmed by them is bound to make you feel
more on top of the grieving process (instead of the other way around). The
goal here is ultimately to develop skills that allow you to remain buoyant as
234
Part III: Healing Grief 

you express grief so that the emotions don’t always take you under. You also
need to remember to be gentle with yourself and cut yourself plenty of slack.
Ways to gain and retain a certain amount of control over your grieving
include:
 Creating your own grief rituals that enable you to frame your grief by
expressing it ceremoniously (refer to the section “Expressing grief
through your own rituals,” earlier in this chapter).
 Finding creative activities you can do that give full range to the expres-
sion of your grief (refer to the section “Expressing your grief creatively,”
earlier in this chapter).
 Sharing your grief with others, both one on one and in a group setting
(see the section “Getting Help Expressing Your Grief,” later in this 
chapter).
 Acquiring new physical skills that make you feel empowered (see
Chapter 15).
For more suggestions of how to control your grief, check out Chapter 15.
Using forgiveness as a 
way to deal with guilt
Guilt related to the loss of a loved one comes in two rather insidious forms:
 Blaming someone else in whole or in part for the death of your loved
one (as in the doctor, the hospital, the medical insurer, God, the weather,
and on and on)
 Blaming yourself in whole or in part for the death of your loved one —
including things that you did and didn’t do for him
Neither one of these forms of guilt, however justified you feel it to be, is really
conducive to helping the grieving process along. In fact, guilt more often than
not staves off grieving and sometimes stops the process cold in its tracks.
Removing the poison arrow of guilt
Finding the reason for your pain isn’t the same as dealing with the pain. In
this way, although assigning blame for the loss may have its place, it in no
way alleviates your need to grieve the loss.
I’m reminded of a parable that the Buddha told his disciples about a noble-
man who was shot in the leg with a poison arrow. When his attendants were
235
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

about to remove the arrow so they could staunch the poison and save his
life, the nobleman stopped them cold. He told them that they could not
remove the poison arrow until after they had identified exactly who shot the
arrow and conveyed the reason for the shot to the nobleman. Of course,
before his attendants could give their master the lowdown on who did the
dirty deed and why, the nobleman died from the poison.
In terms of grieving, guilt is the poison arrow that some people refuse to
remove. In my modest version of Buddha’s parable, a bereaved person says
that he must know exactly who’s responsible for his terrible loss and why it
occurred before he’ll remove the arrow of guilt. And, of course, until he
removes this arrow, he can’t possibly staunch the poison of the grief, thereby
saving himself by giving him back his life.
Finding your way to forgiveness
The only way I know to remove the guilt you feel about a profound loss is to
exercise forgiveness. This is a really tough remedy for a lot of people to accept
because they equate forgiveness with being weak (like a victim) and with
exonerating those who really are responsible for their pain.
We’ve all become so used to wanting to exact justice (or even better, revenge)
for any wrong done to us that sometimes I think that we’ve forgotten the
damage that this need does to us. It isn’t as it says in the Lord’s Prayer —
that we simply forgive others their debts just so that ours are forgiven in
return. We need to forgive so that we don’t have to be saddled with the
weight of the emotional baggage that almost always accompanies the need
for retribution.
When you’re bereaved, you’re already suffering under the weight of the
sorrow you feel. Having to spend what little energy you have left playing pin
the blame on the donkey seems like such a shame. Forgoing this game, if you
can, leaves you much more power to deal with the real work of grieving: per-
sonalizing the loss and letting the grief it brings transform you.
Because forgiveness for yourself as well as others you hold responsible can
be so difficult, this is often the time when you need to seek out the help of
someone who is both impartial and trusted such as a grief counselor or other
mental health professional. Sessions with such a professional can enable you
to freely express all your feelings of guilt and blame (both toward yourself
and others) as well as explore specific strategies for letting these feelings go.
Getting Help Expressing Your Grief
Grieving the loss of a loved one is a very personal experience and something
only you can do yourself. Despite this fact, I don’t think that you have to go it
236
Part III: Healing Grief 

totally alone. Although it’s a journey that only you can make, you can make
the journey quite a bit easier by seeking out the help of others.
In seeking out help, you need to look principally for someone who can really
listen to you and with whom you can freely share your feelings about the
loss. This person can be a friend or acquaintance, but more likely than not it
will be a professional grief counselor.
In addition to finding someone with whom you can share your feelings one 
on one, you may also want to attend a grief support group. A support group
gives you the chance to share your feelings with others who are grieving
their own losses (often of the same type as yours).
A support group affords you a good opportunity to share your struggles with
grief and the story of your relationship with other empathetic and under-
standing people. It also enables you to learn from other bereaved people as
they share their own stories and ups and downs in dealing with grief.
Finding someone who can really listen
When looking for a person who can really listen as you express your grief,
ideally you want to find someone who fits all the following criteria:
 Someone not currently grieving his own loss, especially not the same
loss as yours
 Someone neither uncomfortable with the subject of death nor uncom-
fortable with your displaying your feelings
 Someone with no agenda regarding your feelings or your grieving
process
Usually these criteria rule out close friends because they’re normally the
ones who, although they may be willing to listen to your feelings, can’t refrain
from commenting on them and telling you honestly what they think of what
you’re saying and doing. Moreover, good friends have a definite agenda when
it comes to your feelings and your grief: They all want you to be over the grief
and happy again as soon as possible.
You may be wondering what’s so bad about relying on a close friend who’ll
readily tell you his honest opinion. It’s simply because you’re not really seek-
ing feedback on what you’re saying so much as encouragement to keep
expressing your feelings.
The primary purpose for finding someone to listen is so that you’re able to
speak about and vent all the feelings you have concerning your loss without
reservation and without having to engage in a discussion about them. Ideally,
237
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

your listener will validate your feelings when he can without evaluating them
in any way. Getting the opportunity to express yourself in this manner lets
you begin doing the hard work of piecing together what the loss really means
to your life and, in so doing, begin releasing some of the sorrow and easing
the pain.
If you have to rely upon friends as your listening post, be sure that you don’t
overburden them with your grief and burn them out on listening to you. Don’t
always call upon the same person to listen to your feelings, and seriously
consider relying upon a grief counselor and/or a grief support group to give
your friends a rest from providing this kind of support.
Seeking out professional help
Professional help with grieving is usually available to you in one of two forms:
 Specially trained grief counselors (most of whom are marriage and
family therapists, psychologists, or licensed clinical social workers) who
offer one on one counseling sessions
 Bereavement support group facilitators with training and experience in
conducting different types of grief support groups
Both formats are designed to fully support you in grieving your loss as well
as to offer you an opportunity to freely express your grief.
In deciding between one on one counseling and a support group, you first
need to assess your comfort level in expressing your grief. If you don’t think
you’ll be comfortable expressing your grief in a group situation, you probably
should opt for one on one counseling.
Finding a grief counselor or support group in your local area
Probably the easiest way to find a qualified grief counselor or grief support
group in your vicinity is to contact a hospice organization that operates in
your local area. If your deceased loved one wasn’t on hospice when he died,
you can still make use of a hospice’s grief support services (although you’ll
probably have to pay a nominal fee for the services).
To locate a hospice in your area on the Internet, enter “hospice near [your
city and state]” (as in “hospice near Saint Louis, MO”) into your favorite
search engine. If you don’t have Internet access, contact your physician.
Most doctors are familiar with the hospices that they recommend for their
terminal patients. (And if you find out that your doctor isn’t familiar with any
238
Part III: Healing Grief 

of the hospice organizations in your local area, you may want to seriously
consider changing doctors!)
If your loved one was on hospice before he died, you and your immediate
family members may have free access to the hospice’s grief counseling and
support group services. Some hospices offer up to a year of grief support to
families of the people that have been on service.
If you don’t have any luck finding grief support services through a local hos-
pice (or you don’t have a local hospice), then contact your local church, syn-
agogue, mosque, or temple or the senior services that operate in your
community. Sometimes these institutions offer their own grief support ser-
vices (often in the form of bereavement support groups).
If you’re looking for grief support services to help you with grieving the loss
of a pet, you don’t want to hook up with any human grief support services
offered by your local hospice, religious institution, or senior service organiza-
tion. Instead, you need to contact your local SPCA or animal control service
to find out who in your local area offers one on one counseling or grief sup-
port for bereaved pet parents. People grieving a pet loss who try to use human
grief support services (especially those who inadvertently get into bereavement
support groups) are usually poorly received by the other members. Believe me,
rather than face this kind of resentment, you definitely want to opt for the
acceptance and understanding offered by local pet bereavement services.
Selecting the right grief support group for you
Bereavement support groups generally fall into one of the three following 
categories:
 Open: These groups are ongoing and often offer general bereavement
support. They accept drop-in attendance and usually aren’t restricted to
a particular number of members.
 Closed: These groups run for a preset number of weekly sessions (gen-
erally between 6 and 12) and often are tailored to a particular type of
loss. They require preregistration and usually are restricted to a set
number of members (generally between 8 and 12).
 Special: These groups run for just a set number of sessions (sometimes
as few as one or two) and are tailored to special topics such as
Anticipatory Grief and Creativity and Grief. They require preregistration
and usually are restricted to a set number of members (generally
between 8 to 12).
Depending upon where you live, you may have the opportunity to choose
between joining a general bereavement support group and a special loss
239
Chapter 14: Expressing Your Grief

group designed just for people suffering a particular type of loss. The most
common types of special loss bereavement support groups are
 Parental loss group (for people who’ve lost a parent)
 Spousal/partner loss group (for people who have lost spouses, signifi-
cant others, or life partners)
 Children loss group (for parents who have lost a child of any age)
 Children’s group (for children who have lost parents or siblings)
The $64,000 question in terms of bereavement support groups is whether or
not, given the chance, you should select a special loss support group that
matches the type of loss you’ve suffered over a general bereavement group. If
you select a special loss bereavement support group, you know that you’ll be
among people who understand firsthand the type of loss you’ve suffered. On
the other hand, if you select a general bereavement support group, you’ll
probably be among people suffering a real variety of profound losses. The
answer all comes down to your comfort level.
To join a general bereavement group, you need to be open to listening to
people talk about a number of different types of losses. If you think you’d be
more comfortable with people talking about a loss similar to your own, join
the special loss bereavement group instead of the general one.
What to expect and not to expect from your grief support group
The facilitator or leader of your bereavement support group not only sets the
tone of the group but also determines what, if any, agenda it follows. Many
groups, especially open general bereavement support groups, have a cofacili-
tator in addition to the leader or main facilitator.
Because so much of the group’s success depends upon the group leaders, it’s
very important that you be comfortable with their personalities and leader-
ship style. Some group leaders are more organized and fastidious, while others
are much more laissez-faire and easygoing. Each style, of course, has its own
pros and cons. The important things are that you’re comfortable with the
style and that it doesn’t interfere with your ability to express your feelings 
at the meetings.
At the first meeting of a closed support group, you can generally expect the
group facilitator to do the following:
 Review the purpose and goals of the group: These can include sharing
and giving support as well as providing educational information about
grieving.
240
Part III: Healing Grief 

 Explain the leader’s role in the group: This can include facilitating dis-
cussions and seeing that each member has an adequate opportunity to
share.
 Establish the group’s ground rules by which it operates: These gener-
ally include ensuring complete confidentiality for all that’s said within
the group and the equality and safety of each member. There also may
be rules about being able to pass during a discussion and expected
attendance.
 Encourage discussion and answer all questions: This generally includes
making sure that all the members are clear on the group’s ground rules
and comfortable with its goals.
 Introduce each of the members in the group: This generally includes
having each member tell why he or she is at the meeting, what they
expect from the group, and what they have to offer other members.
 Close the group: This generally includes calling upon members to iden-
tify what they found significant during the meeting as well as a brief dis-
cussion of topics for future meetings.
In subsequent group sessions, the facilitator usually opens the session by
revisiting the previous session to make sure that all loose ends are tied up
from previous discussions before opening the present session to new 
discussions.
You can expect your bereavement support group facilitator to do the following:
 Fully listen to each member and provide appropriate direction to the
group
 Apply knowledge and expertise in group processes and dynamics
 Model the behaviors that are desired in the group and openly share him-
self or herself with the group’s members
 Apply and share knowledge and expertise about the process of grieving
In turn, as a member of the bereavement support group, you’re usually
expected to be willing to commit to do the following:
 Talk about yourself and share your feelings with others
 Listen to other group members as openly as possible
 Take responsibility for your own feelings
 Give and receive feedback
 Be constructive and work for the benefit of the group

Exploring the Physical 
Side of Grief
In This Chapter
 Feeling the physical effects of grief
 Exploring therapies that can help soothe grief
 Getting moving with bodywork, exercise, and sports
 Finding comfort in aromatherapy and other sense-related therapies
I
’d be willing to wager that you usually think of grieving as a mental or
emotional process without stopping to consider its physical manifesta-
tions. People tend to forget that the feelings most commonly associated with
grief are definitely demonstrated physically. Sadness is evident in weeping
and the sounds of wailing or even yelling. Anger shows in tightened muscles,
a red face, and even shortness of breath. Even grief-related emotions, such as
helplessness, not normally associated with particular physical manifesta-
tions, can show in the body through a rather downcast and retiring
demeanor.
This chapter takes a look at the physical aspects of grieving with an eye
toward understanding how you can help your grieving process along through
the use of various physical therapies and disciplines.
I begin the chapter with an examination of the physical effects that grieving
typically has on bereaved people. Then I look at various soothing therapies,
types of bodywork, and exercise that you can pursue to help reduce stress
associated with grieving as well as to ameliorate the entire grieving process. I
conclude with a look at a couple of the nontraditional body-related therapies
that may bring you some good grief relief as well.

The Relationship between the Mental
and Physical Aspects of Grief
After centuries of Western shortsightedness regarding the intimate relation-
ship between body and mind, it seems as if we’re finally rediscovering what
our ancestors knew so well: namely, that body and mind are tightly inte-
grated with one another. Thus, something that strongly affects the mind is
ultimately bound to affect the body, and vice versa.
In light of this renewed understanding of the body/mind connection, the idea
of a psychosomatic illness takes on a new dimension. Instead of referring to
an imaginary illness, you can see it clearly as a process with discernible
physical symptoms resulting directly from emotional stress or conflict. In this
sense, you can regard grieving as the quintessence of a psychosomatic
process (not necessarily a psychosomatic illness, however, because many
people don’t count grief as a type of injury or illness).
Typically, during grieving, a bereaved person’s normal mental processes are
disrupted at times by the following emotions:
 Sadness
 Anger
 Anxiety and guilt
 Apathy or depression
During the grieving process, a bereaved person often displays the following
physical problems:
 Loss of appetite
 Difficulty concentrating and remembering
 Sleeplessness
 Fatigue
 Listlessness
While no one can establish an exact one-to-one cause and effect relationship
between a bereaved person’s typical emotions and typical physical problems,
you can see how these kinds of emotions, especially when they’re as over-
powering as they often are at the outset of the loss, may induce these kinds
of standard physical conditions. And if you’re someone who suffers from
some other physical weakness or ailment (such as diabetes, heart problems,
or high blood pressure), you need to very mindful of ways in which this
added stress can impact your condition.
244
Part III: Healing Grief 

In addition to the outright physical conditions that mental stress can induce
sometimes during grieving, you also may have to contend with temporary,
anxiety-related physical conditions that suddenly come over you while griev-
ing. These can range from simple chest pains and shortness of breath all the
way to full-blown panic attacks, when you feel like you can’t get any breath
and your heartbeat races uncontrollably.
Soothing Therapies
As regards grieving, soothing therapies are any therapies that either alleviate
the grief emotions or help you to release them. They include meditative or
deep-breathing exercises that can help you reduce grief-related stress (and
are often the only way to counteract anxiety-induced physical conditions).
Getting a massage is another great soothing therapy. This massage can be
one that you give yourself, a simple backrub you get from a friend or family
member, or a professional massage.
Doing meditative deep-breathing exercises
Breathing is such a fundamental physical process that it’s often considered
synonymous with life itself. Breathing is also one of thse few bodily functions
that, although normally regulated automatically, your mind can consciously
take over and direct as well.
Each breath you take consists of two distinct phases:
 Inhaling, when you take new air into the lungs (so that your body can
take needed oxygen into your bloodstream)
 Exhaling, when you expel used air (so that your body can force out
unneeded and harmful carbon dioxide along with a little water moisture)
To help reduce anxiety-induced stress that may crop up from time to time
when grieving a profound loss, you may want to start practicing meditative
breathing. This is breathing in which you exert conscious control over both
the inhaling and exhaling phases, calming and slowing them down in order to
breathe as deeply and as thoroughly as possible. Here are some tips for medi-
tative breathing:
 To help you slow down your breathing, count silently to yourself as you
inhale and exhale during each breath. Begin with a count of five for each
phase, and slowly work up to a count of ten. At the end of each phase, be
sure to pause for at least one count before beginning the alternate phase.
245
Chapter 15: Exploring the Physical Side of Grief

 When inhaling a new breath, be aware of filling the lungs from the
bottom to top by releasing your diaphragm muscle above your belly and
allowing your chest to naturally expand upward and outward with air.
 When exhaling used air, be aware of emptying the lungs from bottom to
top, this time by contracting the diaphragm muscle to push the air out
as your chest shrinks and falls a bit.
As you slow down your breathing in this manner, you should also feel a release
of tension first in your chest and then in the rest of your upper body. If you
do this breathing long enough, this release of tension will spread to the rest
of your body, and your mind will definitely relax. Just make sure that your
shoulders don’t start rising and falling as you inhale and exhale — you want
to keep the shoulders down and relaxed at all times during deep breathing.
Deep, meditative breathing can be quite effective after only a few minutes’
time. I suggest that you start out breathing in this manner for no more than
two to five minutes. As you feel comfortable with the practice, extend the
period to ten minutes. If you create your own grief ritual, consider making
meditative deep breathing part of the opening and closing of the ritual (see
Chapter 14 for details).
When you count as you inhale and exhale, stray thoughts (maybe some even
having to do with your grief) may come into your mind, interfering with and
throwing off your count. When you lose count, just start over again from one
and don’t follow the thought any further. In this way, you start training your-
self to stay focused on the task at hand (breathing, in this case) and release
thoughts that you don’t want to pursue at the time.
Massaging away the tension
There’s nothing like a good massage to melt those awful tensions away. (Just
thinking about it while I’m banging away at this keyboard has me wanting one
real bad.) In the hands of a talented and qualified masseur, you can get rid of
plenty of unwanted stress in your body, whether it’s there because of grief,
your job, or just the busy pace of life in general.
The only problems with professional massage are that it’s by appointment
only and can be pretty expensive. If you can’t wait for a scheduled time when
a masseur can work on you, or if you simply can’t afford his services, then
you’ll have to make do with either self-massage or nonprofessional rubs you
can cajole out of your friends and loved ones.
Check out Massage For Dummies by Steve Capellini and Michel Van Welden
(Wiley) for how-to information on both giving and receiving massage.
246
Part III: Healing Grief 

Professional massage
If you’ve never had a professional massage before, you need to let the masseur
know that, and be sure to communicate well with him or her about how deep
to go as well as any really sensitive areas or physical injuries you’ve sustained.
The only thing you need to be acutely aware of when getting a professional
massage during the time you’re grieving a profound loss is that massage can
release not only pent-up physical tensions in the body but emotions as well.
Because this is a time when you’re probably exceptionally vulnerable emo-
tionally, you may find that various types of deep-tissue massage are more
than you can handle at this time; such therapies often trigger deeply held
emotions and cause them to surface.
Self-massage
You don’t have to think of self-massage as a poor-man’s massage so much as
one where you both give and get immediate feedback. After all, because you’re
both pressing the flesh and simultaneously receiving the touch, you immedi-
ately know when you’re applying too much or too little pressure to any area.
You can do effective self-massage to any of three following areas of the body:
 Face and head (part of Shiatsu self-massage): For tension, place your
two thumbs on your temples at the side of your face and your other fin-
gers on the top of your head. With very gentle pressure rotate your
thumbs to massage your temples. You can also relieve tension by using
the knuckles of both hands to gently drum on the head with very light
and rhythmic movements.
To relieve eye fatigue, place your palms over your eyes with the fingers
outstretched and your thumbs on your temples, and then press the
hands gently on the face and hold.
 Hands (hand reflexology): For relaxation, hold one hand with the other,
placing the thumb of one hand in the center of the other palm and the
other fingers on the back of the hand. Use the thumb to gently massage
the entire palm area.
To increase energy flow in the body, use your hands to gently massage
the pads and the areas between each finger, giving special attention to
the area between the thumb and the forefinger.
 Feet (foot reflexology): For relaxation, hold one foot in both of your
hands with your thumbs pressing the sole of the foot, and then rub the
bottom of your foot rigorously.
To increase energy flow in the body, use your hands to separate and
carefully massage the area between each toe.
247
Chapter 15: Exploring the Physical Side of Grief

Some folks think it’s possible to do effective self-massage to your own shoul-
ders (using opposite hands, of course). I have to disagree because I think it’s
really difficult to get sufficient leverage to do a really good job. I recommend
that you stick to massaging the body parts listed here and turn to a profes-
sional for massage in other areas.
Pursuing Transformative Bodywork
There are more physical techniques designed to reduce tension and advance
better functioning than you can shake a stick at (there’s probably one that
even uses sticks!). These include such diverse bodywork and movement tech-
niques as Rolfing, the Rosen Method, the Feldenkrais Method, and Alexander
Technique.
Transformative body techniques such as these generally promote body
awareness in the performance of each movement. Some such as Rolfing and
the Rosen Method consist primarily of touch therapies designed to release
long-held tension and stress as well as help release chronic pain.
Others such as the Feldenkrais Method and Alexander Technique consist pri-
marily of movement therapies designed again to release long-held tensions as
well promote more-efficient physical functioning in the form of increased flex-
ibility and more-fluid, less-strenuous movement, as well as a greater range of
movement.
All these various bodywork and movement methods are designed to trans-
form your awareness of your body as well as promote a release of tension
and the lessening of any pain. When you’re grieving, these therapies also can
be very helpful in releasing pent-up grief emotions.
Releasing stress and pain with 
Rolfing and the Rosen Method
Created by Dr. Ida P. Rolf (1896–1979), Rolfing is officially known by the much
loftier name of Structural Integration of the Human Body. Rolfing takes into
account how gravity affects the body and deals primarily with restriction of
movement caused by the connective tissue (rather than the muscles). Rolfing
can include a number of sessions in which a trained rolfer seeks to unlock
stress and pain throughout the body.
248
Part III: Healing Grief 

The tissue work in Rolfing can be quite intense, and this type of bodywork
has earned a reputation for sometimes being pretty painful. This is especially
true in particularly tense areas of the body or areas where you’ve sustained
an old injury.
In contrast, the Rosen Method is known for its use of gentle direct touch
rather than intense muscle or tissue manipulation. Despite that difference,
the goal of the Rosen Method is very similar to that of Rolfing: namely, the
release of muscle tension, the increase of flexibility and body awareness, and
the lessening of chronic pain. The Rosen Method operates on the basic
theory that muscle tension often has psychological roots and therefore emo-
tions are often released along with pent-up muscular tension.
Augmented functioning thanks 
to the Feldenkrais Method and 
Alexander Technique
Created by Moshe Feldenkrais (1904–1984), the Feldenkrais Method primarily
is a learning process intended to promote increased awareness in body move-
ment; it’s based on the assumption that improving one’s movement improves
one’s overall well-being and attitude toward life. The Feldenkrais Method is
renowned for its understanding of the relationship between intending a move-
ment, imagining the movement, and actually making the movement.
The Feldenkrais Method isn’t a therapeutic technique like Rolfing or the
Rosen Method but rather is a learning system dedicated to teaching you how
to be aware of the integration of body and mind and through this to simulta-
neously improve your physical functioning and your mental outlook. As such,
it’s comprised of a great number of experience-oriented lessons. (Some
Feldenkrais students spend hundreds of hours in training!)
Alexander Technique was created by Frederick Matthias Alexander
(1869–1955), a Shakespearean actor who developed his system of body
awareness and movement based on his own experience correcting his prob-
lems with chronic laryngitis. Like the Feldenkrais Method, Alexander
Technique is a way of learning to increase body awareness and simultane-
ously reduce unnecessary tension.
Alexander Technique is normally taught through private lessons with a trained
facilitator. These lessons teach the student to observe how his habitual ways
of sitting, moving, and standing can be expanded or modified to release ten-
sion and pain. Note that you can apply the benefits taught by this technique
249
Chapter 15: Exploring the Physical Side of Grief

to a whole array of activities — from creative endeavors including athletics,
acting, dancing, singing, and playing a musical instrument to more mundane
undertakings such as recovering from a physical injury and working long
hours at a computer.

Practicing Meditative Body Movement
Eastern body movements systems such as yoga and Taijiquan (t’ai chi chuan)
and martial arts such as karate, judo, and tae kwon do attempt to integrate
body movement with breath and awareness. Taking classes in any of these
meditative body movements systems is a good activity for someone grieving
the profound loss of a loved one.
The best thing about these kinds of body-development systems is that they
challenge and develop you mentally as well as physically. The mental portion
of these disciplines, while it may initially prove a challenge if you’re having
trouble concentrating in your grief, ultimately can be just as helpful as the phys-
ical exercise in supporting the grieving process and keeping it moving along.
Doing yoga
Yoga is one of the most well-known and popular forms of Indian philosophical/
spiritual practices pursued in the West. Even if you’ve never attended a yoga
class in your life, I’ll bet you have a mental picture of the human-pretzel-type
postures (called asanas) that are part of the practice.
Yoga, however, is so much more than eccentric, rather painful-looking poses.
It also includes a whole diet system and full-blown meditation with lots of
concentration on deep breathing similar to the exercise outlined in the ear-
lier section “Doing meditative deep-breathing exercises.”
The great thing about yoga is that it’s for people of all ages and physical skill
levels. Moreover, given its popularity, you’re bound to find a teacher or a class
that suits your particular needs (just check with your local YMCA, community
center, or junior college). Keep in mind that yoga has many schools, each of
250
Part III: Healing Grief 

which has its own slightly different way of teaching the basic postures and
integrating them with other aspects of yoga including breathing and medita-
tion. One school, iyengar yoga, even lets students use props (including belts
and chairs) to help them attain some of the physical postures; the assists can
be very helpful if you’re at a stage in your life when you’re not particularly
flexible. Take the time to find a class that’s right for you.
Even if you only dabble with the physical part of it (generally referred to as
hatha yoga), yoga has many benefits for you as a grieving person. The most
important benefits are increased flexibility and better circulation, which can
help you release stress and tension as well as increase your overall energy level.
Perhaps the most important thing about hatha yoga is the way it can help
improve your self-image. Mastering the postures and breathing can definitely
help you focus and enhance your powers of concentration, which, in turn,
can’t help but make you feel a little bit more in control of your life.
Learning Taiji
Although technically a martial art, most people think of Taiji (which you may
be more familiar with as t’ai chi chuan or simply t’ai chi) as an exercise disci-
pline whose movements are performed in a synchronized group in very slow
motion. Perhaps the most common mental image of Taiji is that of a bunch of
senior citizens all doing the forms very slowly together outside in a park.
Like yoga, Taiji helps you maintain mental agility as well as physical flexibil-
ity. Because its forms are normally performed very slowly and methodically,
it’s a perfect discipline for older people who aren’t able to keep up with some
of the faster paced and more demanding exercise and martial art forms.
Ideally, you assume a stance with a low center of gravity and let all the move-
ments come from the body’s center or core (the area immediately beneath
the belly). This stance not only promotes the psychological feeling of being
centered and balanced both in stillness and motion but also is said to
improve circulation and increase flexibility in all the body’s joints.
The main drawback to Taijiquan is that it’s quite complex, with many distinct
movements to learn (usually between 88 and 108). This can represent quite a
commitment in terms of class time and concentration. If you don’t have time
to commit to learning the full Taiji, you may want to look into taking a qigong
(ch’i kung) class or seminar. This Chinese discipline also combines breathing,
concentration, and movements to promote better health, but its movement
sequences are normally much less complex than in Taiji.
T’ai Chi For Dummies, by Therese Iknoian with Manny Fuentes (Wiley), is an
excellent beginner’s guide to Taiji; it also contains some instruction on
qigong and combining the two forms.
251
Chapter 15: Exploring the Physical Side of Grief

Doing other martial arts
Taiji appeals to folks of all ages because of the relaxed and slow nature of its
movements, but by no means is it the only martial art that you can pursue to
obtain some relief when grieving.
In fact, if you’re experiencing a lot of anger along with the sadness or you just
have a lot of unharnessed energy (the opposite of the listlessness often expe-
rienced as a part of grief), consider a more energetic martial art. You may get
more benefit from an activity that not only makes use of more energetic
movements but also enables you to test your mental and physical agility
directly against an opponent.
Here’s a short list of some other popular martial art forms whose movements
tend to be a bit more energetic than Taiji and which are known more for their
hand-to-hand (or even hand-to-foot) contests:
 Karate: Japanese martial art known for quick strikes that can include a
whole bunch of punches and kicks
 Judo: Japanese martial art known for throws, pins, and locks (punches
and kicks aren’t allowed)
 Tae kwon do: Korean martial art known for fast and powerful kicks and
punches
Note that all three of these martial arts burn up a lot of energy, offer you a
safe way to release some pent-up frustration, and instill a new level of self-
confidence and feeling of control over your destiny. For this reason, these
kinds of martial arts can be particularly well-suited for grieving folks of both
genders who need to release pent-up emotions but also need a little boost in
their self-confidence.
Physical Exercise
If none of the fancy-Dan bodywork and movement systems described earlier
in this chapter appeal to you, there’s always good old-fashioned physical
exercise. This can be anything from taking a walk around the block or jogging
in the park to doing calisthenics or participating in some sort of team sport.
Although calisthenics and traditional sports aren’t normally thought of as
being particularly meditative, you need not approach them this way. Indeed,
you can bring a new level of awareness both in terms of breathing and body
movement to any exercise routine you do or physical game you play (note
that playing Xbox or Playstation doesn’t count).
252
Part III: Healing Grief 

The problem you may run into is that, if you’re the type of person who has
trouble motivating yourself to do routine exercise when you’re not grieving,
you may find it nigh unto impossible to get yourself motivated to do it when
you’re suffering the emotional imbalances that come with grief (especially
the listlessness).
If this is your case, you may need to get take a class that offers a favored
physical activity or join a team sport so that you get outside encouragement
and reinforcement (from the class instructor or coach and fellow classmates
or teammates) to help keep you motivated.
Doing cardio and strength training
When I think of getting physical exercise, I usually think of going to the gym
to get a good cardiovascular (also known as aerobic, meaning “with oxygen”)
workout on a treadmill as well as to strength train by lifting weights or using
one of the many resistance-type weight machines.
As you’re probably well aware, a cardiovascular workout is great for the
health of the old ticker because it gets more oxygen into the blood and more
blood to the heart. Some kind of aerobic exercise is considered essential to
physical fitness — although there are tons of ways to get this kind of exercise
without walking or running like a gerbil on a treadmill (such as bicycling, run-
ning, and swimming, to name a few).
Strength training, which is considered an anaerobic (without oxygen) exer-
cise, is used to strengthen and shape different muscle groups. You can do
this type of exercise by lifting weights or by using some sort of resistance
mechanism, which can be anything from a sophisticated weight machine to a
simple elastic band.
Note that strength training is good not only for building up particular mus-
cles but also for increasing bone density, both of which can help improve
your overall posture. The only downside to strength training is that while it
goes about increasing the bulk and density of particular muscles, it does noth-
ing to enhance their flexibility. Therefore, if you get serious about strength
training, you may also want to do stretching exercises to maintain flexibility.
If you’re not at all interested in bulking up your muscles but want to increase
your strength and maintain flexibility, consider a Pilates exercise program.
Pilates is said to strengthen the muscles without adding undue bulk to them.
It’s also known for its emphasis on maintaining body awareness and breath
control during all phases of movement, both of which are especially benefi-
cial for folks dealing with grief.

Chapter 15: Exploring the Physical Side of Grief

Playing sports
Sports are great forms of exercise if you’re grieving because you participate
with other people either in teams or as individual competitors and because
sports normally challenge you both mentally as well as physically.
It doesn’t really matter which sport you select; it can be something as tame
as pee-wee golf, as artistic as ballroom dancing, or as thrilling as skateboard-
ing and whitewater rafting. The biggest reward for a bereaved person partici-
pating in the sport comes from the pure enjoyment of doing the activity. It
gives you both a needed respite from the grief and a chance to release some
pent-up frustration.
The competitive aspect of many sports, whether played in teams (like soccer
and baseball) or against a sole competitor (like handball and tennis), also may
be beneficial for a person who’s grieving. Whether you win or lose, competi-
tion can help you release emotions surrounding grief, help improve your self-
confidence, and help you regain the sense of being in control of your fate again.
Doing activities that get 
you back to nature
Sometimes the best form of physical therapy is one that’s also good for the
spirit. Here, I’m thinking of any physical activity that gets you back into nature.
Depending upon where you live, this can mean taking a simple walk in a local
park, horseback riding out in the country, or doing something as challenging
as backpacking and rock climbing in the mountains.
Combining much needed physical exercise with the opportunity to re-
experience the beauty and wonder of nature can do you a world of good when
you’re grieving a profound loss. Being back in nature presents you with a new,
more open perspective from which to process your grief. It also can help recon-
nect you with the bigger process of life, of which you’re still a vital part.
Going with Nontraditional 
Body Therapies
Twenty years ago, Eastern physical disciplines such as yoga and Taiji might
have been considered really “out there.” Yet, nowadays they’re looked at as
no more exotic than learning to golf or going swimming.
254
Part III: Healing Grief 

So too, alternative body therapies such as aromatherapy and acupressure
(also known as Shiatsu), which today are often seen as being either pseudo-
scientific or, in some cases, downright nonscientific, may be regarded tomor-
row as no more controversial than taking aspirin for a headache. This section
covers using aromatherapy and acupressure in case you have the desire to
try something less traditional to help you with grieving.
Calming your senses with aromatherapy
Aromatherapy is the name given to the use of essential oils from various
plants to relieve pain and increase your sense of well-being. Sometimes these
oils are applied to the skin in hopes of attaining pain relief; other times,
they’re heated (often in diffusers or dishes warmed by candles) to release
scents into the air.
Although most of the evidence for the effectiveness of aromatherapy is anec-
dotal and many doctors attribute any benefit to the placebo effect (or psy-
chosomatic, to get technical), none of that really matters when you’re dealing
with grief. The bottom line is if these aromas soothe your physical or psycho-
logical pain in grieving, it’s not so terribly relevant whether the benefit actu-
ally comes from the fragrances themselves or from your faith in their ability
to provide this relief.
Here are some of the more popular essential oils that you may want to try
out, along with the purported benefits that they bestow:
 Basil: Considered good for nervous exhaustion and depression
 Lavender: Considered good for calming strong emotions such as anger,
panic, and insomnia
 Rose: Considered to be an aid in healing emotional wounds and good at
relieving sorrow and depression
 Rosemary: Considered to be an aid to confidence and creativity as well
as good in calming nightmares and helping you remember good dreams
 Sandalwood: Considered to be an aid to meditation and concentration
as well as good for calming nervousness
Don’t ever take any essential oils internally (not even ones like basil that you
would normally use in your spaghetti sauce in abundance). Also, many essen-
tial oils are irritating to the skin, so you should never put them directly on
your skin. Instead, add a drop or two to your bath water or use a diffuser to
release their aromas.

relax, check out Aromatherapy For Dummies by Kathi Keville (Wiley).
Getting holistic help from acupressure
Acupressure is derived from traditional Chinese medicine. The purpose of
acupressure is to stimulate particular pressure points in order to correct cer-
tain energy imbalances in the body, thereby relieving pain and restoring
health. Although it utilizes the same meridians and pressure points as
acupuncture, it uses either hand or elbow pressure instead of needles to
stimulate the energy.
Although many Western scientists and physicians remain skeptical of the
effectiveness of both acupuncture and acupressure, both therapies are gain-
ing more and more converts as purely anecdotal evidence gives way to med-
ical studies.
Also known in the Japanese form of Shiatsu (meaning “finger pressure”), acu-
pressure is reported not only to relieve tension but also to promote overall
health and well-being by increasing the circulation of vital energy throughout
the body. To get a taste for what Shiatsu can do for you, try my face and head
self-massage techniques that appear in the section “Massaging away the 
tension,” earlier in this chapter. For more information on acupressure and
referrals to practitioners, check out the Acupressure Institute Web site at

Coping with Holidays and
Anniversaries
In This Chapter
 Getting through major and minor holidays without your loved one
 Observing birthdays and anniversaries
 Creating your own anniversary celebrations after a loss
G
etting through holidays is often a tough enough job on its own without
adding the extra burden of grieving a profound loss. When you’re griev-
ing a loss, especially a new one, the entire annual cycle of holidays, birthdays,
and other anniversaries can be very trying and painful and a real challenge to
get through.
Normally, holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries are days of celebration, in
the sense of both merriment and remembrance. When you’re grieving the
loss of a loved one with whom or for whom you celebrated these days, how-
ever, such days are completely devoid of festivity but remain full of memo-
ries. Many of these memories are extremely painful because they remind you
how alone you are on a day you would otherwise spend with your loved one.
This chapter looks at some of the typical challenges that arise when special
days roll around, particularly in the first year of the loss. I guide you through
some strategies you can employ to deal with the concerted grief that these
days bring and, hopefully, also convert them from particularly miserable days
into special celebratory days. If you can’t turn a holiday or anniversary into
an honest-to-goodness festivity, then you can at least aim for a constructive
kind of commemoration (although it’s perfectly okay if you can manage noth-
ing more than simply getting through the day).

Why Holidays Can Be Difficult
Under the best circumstances, holidays are festive times when family and
friends gather together to enjoy each other’s company and love as they com-
memorate some special event. Secular or religious, this special event just has
to be an occasion deemed worthy of observance in the senses of remem-
brance and making merry.
Holidays are particularly awkward times for people grieving a profound loss
because someone with whom you generally celebrate the day is not present.
This absence makes it difficult to enjoy the day and almost impossible not to
be reminded of the loss. And because so many holidays are public celebra-
tions where you interact with other people (sometimes lots of other people),
it may be difficult when all you want to do is hide and grieve.
When talking about holidays, most people make a pretty big distinction
between the string of holidays that occur in the last few months of the year
(which are often just referred to as “the holidays”) and all the other holidays
spread out over the rest of the year. When you’re grieving, these end-of-year
holidays can be particularly grueling, especially in the first few years immedi-
ately following the loss.
In surviving holidays after the loss of a loved one, you may find it works better
for you to try and meet each one head-on with a touch of grace and grit rather
than trying to avoid it. (Of course, if you find yourself too exhausted from the
grieving one year to do anything more than lie low, then by all means cut
yourself the necessary slack and realize that you may well be able to manage
this approach next year.) If you’re able to face holidays head-on, I suggest
that you celebrate them with the loved one in mind. Use the celebration to
remember and honor your loved one, keeping in mind that, for the time
being, you’re under absolutely no obligation to enjoy these special days; you
just have to get through them.
Dealing with the End-of-the-Year
Holidays
For the folks living in the Northern Hemisphere, the holidays celebrated in
fast succession in the last three months of the year are winter holidays.
These holidays are celebrated in times when the hours of darkness, storms,
and cold are increasing and when vegetation is dying back and nature is
going into hibernation.
258
Part III: Healing Grief 

As such, these holidays have a certain amount of solemnity built into them.
This may be part of the reason that they sometimes involve rather intense
and expressive celebrations that most people find very important. If you’re
grieving the loss of a loved one during this time, you have to deal with the
general gloominess of the season as well as with a certain amount of garish-
ness built into the celebrations.
Halloween and the Day of the Dead
The first end-of-the year holiday you encounter is Halloween, a holiday that
could be a particularly appropriate celebration for bereaved people. But in
the United States, at least, Halloween has become primarily a children’s holi-
day associated as much with begging for sweets and the more macabre
aspects of death as with honoring and remembering the dead.
Because children commonly dress up in costume and go trick-or-treating to
neighborhood houses for Halloween, if you’re grieving the loss of a young
child, you may have a particularly difficult time with this aspect of the cele-
bration. Make sure that you’re away from home that night so that you don’t
have to deal with all the children who visit or feel that you have to hide out
and not answer the door.
In Mexico and other South American countries, Halloween is intimately tied
to the celebration of the Day of the Dead on November 1 (All Saints’ Day in
the Catholic Church), a day when people honor deceased ancestors by visit-
ing their graves and making offerings of food, drink, flowers, and candles (see
Chapter 17 for more on this celebration).
Consider borrowing a page from the Day of the Dead and making Halloween 
a celebration that honors all your loved ones who have passed on. If the
weather’s too harsh to actually visit their graves, or if you don’t live any-
where near them, create an altar by decorating a spot in your house with can-
dles and flowers and maybe even pictures of your loved ones.
Thanksgiving
Next up on the end-of-the-year holiday calendar is Thanksgiving (at least in
the U.S., as Canadian Thanksgiving comes earlier in October). This is the first
of the holidays in which family traditions may play a part in making the day
especially difficult to get through without your lost loved one.
Family members traditionally travel to gather together for Thanksgiving, and
traditions usually include hosting or helping to prepare a special dinner. Not
259
Chapter 16: Coping with Holidays and Anniversaries

having your loved one may make this holiday tremendously difficult or even
impossible to get through if he acted as the traditional host of the celebration.
Bereaved people often struggle with this holiday in part because many fami-
lies routinely set aside time at the table to reflect upon and recount the bless-
ings they’ve enjoyed during the preceding year. The loss of a loved one
makes for a year that comes up short in the blessings department. If this is
your family tradition, you may want to alter it slightly: Have each person at
the table recount the blessings that they received as a result of having the
lost loved one in their lives.
For the first Thanksgiving after the loss, you may find more comfort in keep-
ing in place the established family tradition for the meal (assuming that’s still
possible). If you do, you may want to set a place for your loved one at the
table and have the family talk about and toast your loved one before eating.
For the second Thanksgiving, I suggest that you intentionally modify the tra-
ditional meal either in terms of the menu or where you gather while still
remembering and toasting your lost loved one.
Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa
The major holidays celebrated in December include Christmas in the Christ-
ian tradition, Hanukkah in the Jewish tradition, and Kwanzaa in the African
American tradition. In addition, a few people still celebrate the winter solstice
(the shortest day of the year) in the form of some sort of yule celebration.
These are often the hardest holidays to get through because they carry the
most pressure to make merry and have a good time. Especially in industrial-
ized countries, Christmas is a particularly glitzy affair that’s impossible to
avoid — signs literally appear everywhere and throughout all the media as
merchandisers try to sell, sell, sell.
Because gift giving is such a big part of Christmas (and is becoming more and
more important in some Hanukkah celebrations), you need to be especially
careful not to give into the temptation to overspend in hopes of shopping
your way out of your sorrow. If you have children, keep in mind that you can’t
buy bereaved children out of their grief anymore than you can shop your way
out of it.
For the first Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa after the loss, you may find it
more comforting to continue your established holiday traditions with your
immediate family, even if you need to cut back on or cut out entirely other
parties and social gatherings. If you put up stockings for Christmas, be sure
to have a stocking for your lost loved one that you can fill with things that
260
Part III: Healing Grief 

remind you of him or messages containing anecdotes and stories of favorite
Christmases you spent together. If you light candles on a menorah, be sure to
remember your loved one on each of the eight days. If you light candles or
pass around a chalice during the celebration of the seven days of Kwanzaa,
be sure to remember your lost loved one before lighting them or taking a sip
from the kikombe cha umoja.
New Year’s Day
New Year’s completes the string of year-end holidays. In the first year after
the loss, this is the one celebration when you may want to forgo all previ-
ously established traditions because it’s the one holiday normally celebrated
with public parties and other types of get-togethers that will probably be too
much to manage at this time. For example, if you normally host a New Year’s
Eve party, consider canceling it, and if you usually go out to a party or fancy
restaurant, consider staying home.
Instead of exuberant celebration, make this a time of quiet reflection. New
Year’s Day is usually the time for making resolutions for the year ahead, so
you may benefit from remembering a particular quality that your loved one
embodied that you would like to possess in such abundance. Make it your
New Year’s resolution to work hard on cultivating that quality in yourself
during the forthcoming year.
Dealing with the Rest of the Holidays
After contemplating the difficulties of getting through the slew of holidays all
bunched together at the end of the year, you may think that holding up through
the remainder of the holidays that are spread out over the rest of the year
would be a piece of cake. But that’s not quite the case.
Although it helps that these other holidays are celebrated during times of
extended daylight hours and often much milder temperatures, depending
upon the particular loss and the nature of the relationship, the remaining hol-
idays may not pass by any smoother than those at the end of the year.
Valentine’s Day
Valentine’s Day is a celebration of love. Although ostensibly a holiday set
aside specifically for romantic lovers, Valentine’s Day has come to include all
261
Chapter 16: Coping with Holidays and Anniversaries

types of love. You can see the pervasiveness of the spirit of Valentine’s Day in
the exchange of Valentine’s messages, candies, and even stuffed animals
between children, friends, parents and their children, and lovers.
Given the holiday’s theme of love, February 14 is especially painful for those
suffering the loss of a spouse or partner as a result of divorce or death.
However, Valentine’s Day can be equally difficult if you’re suffering any other
kind of profound loss because love is part of your relationship and one of the
things you miss and mourn for in your grief.
View Valentine’s Day as an occasion for reflecting upon all the love you
received from your lost loved one and giving thanks for that love. Also, con-
template this love as being the one thing that lives on beyond the death and
one thing that will sustain you through your grief.
Easter and Pesach
The spring season brings with it two religiously inspired holidays: Easter in
the Christian faith and Pesach (Passover) in the Jewish religion. For believ-
ers, these holidays represent renewal of God’s power in history; for Easter,
it’s God’s power to free His people from slavery, and for Pesach, it’s God’s
power to free them from death. Because of the spring timing of these celebra-
tions, the underlying renewal theme is reinforced in nature by the regenera-
tion of vegetation (at least in the Northern Hemisphere).
Bereaved people of faith can find comfort in celebrating these holidays even
if their sorrow doesn’t allow them to celebrate as fully as they might other-
wise. Christian believers may be reassured by Christ’s deliverance from the
grave and may find hope in being reunited in due time with their loved ones
in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jewish believers may be reassured by God’s deliv-
erance of their ancestors from bondage and may find hope in being reunited
with their loved ones in the World to Come.
Mother’s Day and Father’s Day
Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are opportunities to honor the love and sacri-
fice that mothers and fathers routinely make for their children. As such,
they’re traditionally occasions when children show their affection for their
parents with cards, gifts, dinners out, or all of the above.
262
Part III: Healing Grief 

As you can imagine, these two holidays are particularly difficult both for chil-
dren or adults grieving the recent loss of a parent and for mothers and
fathers grieving the loss of a child.
Children who have recently lost their mothers or fathers feel the loss
intensely on the respective days because they’re reminded that they no
longer have a living parent to fete. Parents grieving the losses of children can
also feel the loss intensely on their special days; they’re reminded of their
losses on the days when their children would have honored them.
If you’re a son or daughter grieving the loss of a parent on Mother’s or
Father’s Day, use the day to remember your parent and reflect on all the love
and support you received from her or him. If you’re a parent grieving the loss
of a son or daughter, reflect on all the love your child engendered in you as
well as all the qualities that made your child so special.
U.S. national holidays
Major U.S. national holidays honor the birth of the nation as well as the men
and women who have sacrificed their lives in military service. These national
holidays include:
 Independence Day on July 4 to mark the birth of the nation
 Veteran’s Day on November 11 to mark the end of World War I and to
commemorate those who died in that war
 Memorial Day on the last Monday in May to honor all servicemen and
servicewomen who have given their lives serving their country
These national holidays can be particularly stressful if your loved one died in
military service. When this is the case, it’s inevitable that the observances of
these holidays remind you of your loss.
Note that Independence Day also can be a source of difficulty for those griev-
ing losses unrelated to military service because it’s a time when family and
friends routinely get together to celebrate the day and focus on having fun
(which may be the last thing you want to do).
People who have lost loved ones in military service can take some comfort
from the fact that their fellow countrymen overwhelmingly support them in
their time of grief and deeply appreciate the sacrifices that their loved ones
(children, parents, siblings, or friends) made on behalf of their country.
263
Chapter 16: Coping with Holidays and Anniversaries

Surviving Anniversaries
Anniversaries in the form of birthdays, death days, wedding days, graduation
days, and other days marking milestones in a life can be even more difficult
to deal with than holidays when you’re grieving. After all, anniversaries usu-
ally mark much more private events that, without the loved one’s presence,
are difficult or even impossible to continue observing.
The best way to approach the anniversaries you routinely celebrated with
your lost loved one is to continue to mark these days as special occasions for
remembrance and reflection. Instead of celebrating these days, use them as
opportunities to think carefully about all the things you miss as well as all the
things you shared.
Birthdays and anniversaries of the death
During a loved one’s lifetime, his birthday is one of the most important
anniversaries that you mark and celebrate together. After his passing, espe-
cially in the first few years, this particular day is very sad because it reminds
you of the death and often heightens the grief you suffer.
The anniversary of a loved one’s death also marks an important milestone in
mourning his passing. In various religious traditions (see Chapter 17), this
anniversary date is meticulously commemorated with a grave-site ceremony,
especially on the first-year anniversary (known as the Jahrzeit in Judaism).
I strongly suggest that you be quite proactive about observing both the birth-
day of a lost loved one and the anniversary of his death. If the idea of per-
forming your own grief ritual (as I outline in Chapter 14) is something that
appeals to you, these days are perfect occasions on which to do so. If rituals
aren’t your cup of tea, you can still mark these days in your own way. As part
of these observances, you may want to reflect upon the significance that your
loved one had in your life and the way in which you intend to keep those
qualities alive in the rest of your life.
Other anniversaries
Depending upon the relationship you shared with your lost loved one, you
may have other special days (in addition to birthdays and death anniver-
saries) that bring his absence to the forefront of your consciousness.
264
Part III: Healing Grief 

These anniversary days can mark big events in your shared lives.
 If you’re mourning the passing of a spouse or partner, you may need
to face the anniversaries of the day you met your loved one and the day
you wed. You also can mark smaller, even more intimate anniversaries
such as the day you moved in together, bought your first house, or took
your first overseas vacation.
 If you’re a parent mourning the loss of a child, personal anniversaries
can include the day the child took his first step, graduated high school
or college, or got his first apartment.
Be aware that personal anniversary days, especially the smaller and more
intimate ones, can trigger a STUG (Sudden Temporary Upsurge of Grief) long
after you feel as though you’ve finished grieving the loss. When this occurs,
remember that the intense feelings of grief are only temporary, and try to use
them as a catalyst for honoring the memory of your loved one and the love
you continue to share.
Creating Your Own Holiday and
Anniversary Celebrations
I’m all for taking as much control over your grieving process as you possibly
can. I take this stance because I believe that although the process is essen-
tially self-propelled and forward-moving, it can get stuck in places. Therefore,
anything you can do to feel as though you’re participating in the grieving
(and maybe even taking some control of it) is beneficial to you because it
assists the process you’re undergoing.
The overriding problem with holidays and anniversaries is that even under
the best circumstances, you can feel as though the tradition and mood of the
observance is in control, so your emotional response to the event is forced
and not genuine. When you’re grieving and the last thing on your mind is
having a good time, feeling not in control and not in the spirit of the event
can be greatly exaggerated.
Instead of trying to ignore the celebration altogether and pretend it isn’t hap-
pening (which usually doesn’t prevent you from feeling even worse about
your grief and loss), I suggest that you concentrate on creating your own cel-
ebration for the event, remembering that a celebration isn’t just a time of
merriment but also a time of commemoration. Although your loss may pre-
vent you from making merry, it in no way prevents you from making the day
265
Chapter 16: Coping with Holidays and Anniversaries

into one of remembrance. All you need to do to take some control over the
holiday or anniversary is come up with ways you can honor the spirit of the
day as well as the memory of your lost loved one.
Depending upon the particular event being celebrated, you can find ways not
only to specifically recall your loved one and all that you shared but also to
share the love he gave you by serving others and dedicating your service to
his memory. Here are a few examples:
 Instead of making an elaborate Thanksgiving meal at home, you and
your other family members can volunteer to prepare and/or serve meals
to those in need.
 For Christmas or Hanukkah, instead of spending a great deal of time and
money on presents for family, get the family involved in providing toys,
food, and much needed clothing for those who would otherwise do 
without.
 Raise money for your favorite charities and make donations in your
loved one’s name.
For birthdays and other anniversaries, come up with inventive and personal
ways to share the love that you used to celebrate with your lost loved one.
By holding your own celebrations instead of only staying home and feeling
your sorrow, you communicate your love to others and ensure that it remains
vibrant and very much alive.

this part opens with an investigation of the spiritual mean-

ways of remembering and memorializing the loss.

Exploring Grief in the 
Spiritual Traditions
In This Chapter
 Confirming death and grieving as vital parts of all religious traditions
 Exploring death and grieving in secular society
 Contemplating death and grieving in various religious and spiritual traditions
 Continuing the relationship with the dead in Hispanic and Chinese cultures
 Cultivating a new attitude toward death
F
or most people, grieving the loss of a loved one is an intense spiritual
journey. It’s one that tests your beliefs and calls upon your inner
strength. For some people, the journey is made all the more difficult when
they lack a vigorous spiritual life at the time of the loss or have lapsed in the
exercise of their childhood religious tradition and cultural practices.
This chapter looks at the spiritual aspect of grieving by examining the impact
of the death and loss in a variety of different spiritual traditions and cultures.
It begins by examining the universal importance of death in every one of these
various traditions. Then I move on to investigate death’s impact in individual
traditions and cultures.
As a point of comparison, the chapter begins with an overview of the place of
death and grief in the secular society that was traditionally associated with
the Western culture but that’s more and more becoming a global phenomenon
often linked with the spread of international consumerism. I walk you through
the impact of death and grief in the three Abrahamic religious traditions —
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — before exploring the viewpoints of the tra-
ditionally Eastern religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Then I explain the
veneration and celebration of the dead in the Hispanic and Chinese cultures.
The chapter concludes with a bid for a new secular attitude toward death and
the dead based on a combination of modern ecological thinking and traditional

Daoist (Taoist) philosophy. I believe that combining ecology’s interest in hon-
oring and preserving the environment with Daoism’s ideas on death as a nat-
ural transformation offers the best hope for developing a spiritual view of
death in today’s secular society.
Death’s Vital Role in Spiritual Traditions
That death plays a crucial role in all major religions and spiritual traditions
almost goes without saying. In large part this is because, by definition, divine
beings are immortal and therefore stand in stark contrast to the human con-
dition. A good part of the function of religion is to explain and reconcile this
dichotomy.
For the most part, religions do this in their belief in some sort of life after
death. In the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, this life
after death mirrors that of the divine in that it’s eternal and bestowed as a
reward for a mortal life well lived in the service of God. In the case of Hinduism
and Buddhism, this life after death comes in the form of a new mortal life
whose state is a direct result of the type of life one led prior to death (karma).
Although the promise of renewed or continued life is most often the focus of
the practitioners of various religious traditions, the fact remains that all
these promises depend on the quality of the life that you lead before death.
The crux of the spiritual tradition, then, is to explain the purpose of life (and
consequently, death) and how to live a life that achieves that purpose. That’s
where the various religions differ significantly, offering different rationales for
life and death and different ways in which to fulfill life’s divine purpose.
The upcoming sections investigate the attitudes particular spiritual and cul-
tural traditions have toward death and dying. My goal is to delineate the pur-
pose of life (and consequently, death) within the tradition or culture and help
you understand how this stance influences the customs and practices of its
members toward death, dying, and, in the final analysis, grieving.
I start this survey, however, not with an analysis of a particular spiritual tra-
dition but rather with an examination of modern secular society’s attitude
toward death, dying, and grieving. I do this because, like it or not, the strong
death-denying outlook of this basically materialistic worldview permeates
most of our lives, even for those engaged in strong spiritual practices. In
addition, this analysis provides a perfect contrast to the attitudes of all the
various spiritual traditions and cultures included in this survey.
270
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

Secular Society and Death
Given that secular society is geared toward gain, especially in the materi-
alistic sense, it comes as no surprise that death has little or no place in its
worldview. What is surprising is the depth to which secular society is both
death-denying and, at times, downright hostile toward grieving. This may be
due in part to the cult of youth that seems to figure more and more promi-
nently in modern consumerism all around the world. In a society where look-
ing good is equated with looking young and aging is no longer just a concern
for women, it’s not hard to understand why death has become so thoroughly
taboo.
Fundamentally, in secular society death is equated with defeat. I believe that
this view stems from the fact that death flies directly in the face of all that
secular society holds dear. After all, according to the gospel of secular soci-
ety, the purpose of life is to accumulate everything you can: power, educa-
tion, and, above all, material goods.
Death, however, repudiates all these accomplishments. At death, you have to
leave all your influence, knowledge, and stuff behind. Even worse, not only do
you not get to take it with you, you don’t have any real say in who benefits
from and gets all that you’re forced to leave behind!
In a worldview that can find no good use for death, it comes as no surprise 
to find that secular society’s highest aspiration is the eventual elimination 
of the aging process and therefore death from natural causes. In secular soci-
ety, aging and the death that results from it are relegated to the place of a
fatal disease that, like AIDS or cancer, is at the top of science’s checklist for
eradication.
As I point out in Chapter 1, tolerance for grieving the death of a loved one in
modern secular society is very low. To begin with, grieving can’t help but be
seen as counterproductive because it takes you away from the main goal of
life (to get ahead and accumulate more). Moreover, being around someone
who’s actively grieving the death of a loved one is a not-so-subtle reminder of
one’s own mortality. In keeping with the maxim “out of sight, out of mind,”
the fewer reminders you have of your own mortality, the better you’re able 
to sustain the illusion that all your endeavors to get more don’t come to
naught in the face of your inevitable demise. Turn to the section “Melding
Deep Ecology and Daoism to Create a New Spiritual Approach to Death,” at
the end of this chapter for some ideas on how to counter these beliefs.

Death in Judaism
Judaism is the oldest of the three Abrahamic faiths as well as the ancestor of
the two younger world religions, Christianity and Islam. Unlike most other
world religions, Judaism doesn’t actively seek converts. The religion is con-
sidered the direct result of a unique relationship (referred to as a covenant or
contract) formed between God and the Hebrew (Jewish) people in particular.
As such, the sacred writings of Judaism (many of which are incorporated 
into the Christian Bible) chronicle the development of this exceptional rela-
tionship from the inception of the world’s creation until the building of the
Second Temple in Jerusalem (around 350 BCE). This chronicle represents a
vivid portrait of a how a people’s search for God shapes not only their iden-
tity but their destiny as well.
The purpose of life in Judaism
According to Judaism, soon after creating the world, God created humanity —
in his own image — in the form of Adam, the original man, and Eve, his help-
mate. God created this pair for the purpose of overseeing all the other crea-
tures in His creation and, conversely, tending to His creation.
Because God created the first human, Adam, from the very “dust of the
earth” and then breathed the spirit of life into him, the idea of one day return-
ing to the dust of the earth at death is not at all a foreign idea. Indeed, the
question that Judaism has wrestled with most in its long history is just what
happens to the living spirit God instills in us upon our death.
Views of an afterlife in Judaism
The idea of a life after death remains somewhat vague in Judaism despite sug-
gestions by some of the scriptures of an afterlife in the World to Come (olam
ha-ba) — either to the world of the Law’s restoration initiated by the coming
of God’s Messiah (“anointed one”) or to the judgment of mankind at the End of
Days. Rabbinic teachings speak of a resurrection of the dead that will occur
as part of one or the other of these eras.
Here are three of the more prevalent Jewish views of what happens to a soul
after death:
 The soul awaits the appearance of the Messiah, at which time the body
and soul are resurrected if the person’s judged to have lived a righteous
life (otherwise the soul perishes with the body).
272
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

 The soul stays near the body until after the funeral, at which time it
undergoes a period of purification (at the end of which it returns to the
earth, according to some Jews).
 The soul perishes with the body, and immortality comes through one’s
descendants on earth.
While beliefs of an afterlife are a little fuzzy in Judaism, beliefs regarding
duties, obligations, and goals in the current life are quite clear. In short,
adherents are required to live a righteous life, which leads to the healing or
mending of the world (tikkun ha-olam) and consequently the healing of their
own souls in relationship to God.
Formal mourning in the Jewish tradition
In Judaism, both the treatment of the dead and the process of grieving the
death are highly ritualized. Indeed, to honor the dead and comfort the
mourner are two of the most important commandments in Judaism.
Traditionally, no formal mourning is done if the loved one is a baby less than
30 days old, is someone who has converted from Judaism to another religion,
or is a person who has committed suicide. (In the case of suicide, mourning
may be permitted if it’s determined that the person wasn’t fully aware of his
actions. The decision to mourn is at the rabbi’s discretion.) In addition, no
mourning is carried out if the body of the loved one is missing (until the body
is found or until the body’s been deemed unrecoverable) or has been cremated
or interred in a crypt or mausoleum (rather than buried directly in the earth).
The major phases of formal mourning in all sects of Judaism are divided into
the following periods:
 Aninut: This is the period between the death of a loved one and his
burial, which is to take place as soon after death as possible except on
the Sabbath, High Holidays, or Festivals. After death, the body is ritually
cleansed and watched over by members of a special burial society
called the Chevra Kadisha. The funeral service is normally simple, con-
sisting of prayers, psalms, and a eulogy with no flowers (donations are
given instead to charity in memory of the deceased). Gentiles are wel-
come at the funeral (but take no part in the interment of the body), and
all men should wear a head covering. During this period, the religious
participation of the members of the immediate grieving family is limited,
and they aren’t comforted. Also, they don’t socialize during this period,
and it’s a ritual that their outer garments be torn to indicate their state
of mourning.
 Shiva: This is the seven-day period following the burial of the loved one.
During this period, all mirrors in the home are covered; the family remains
273
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

quiet and performs only rudimentary hygiene (no shaving or cutting of
hair). For the first three days, the members of the immediate family
mourn in private and receive no visitors. For the next four days, the
family sits shiva, which refers to the practice of sitting on low stools
when receiving condolence calls from the extended family, friends, and
co-workers. Visitors normally bring food and don’t greet the mourners
but rather wait until the bereaved speak first. During these visits, the
prayer of the Kaddish (see the sidebar “A little about the Kaddish”) is
recited if a minyan (a group of ten adult people — men in the Orthodox
tradition) is present. Sometimes, the end of shiva is marked by an act
forbidden during the period, such as cutting one’s hair, studying the
Torah (the first five books of the Bible), or making loud noise (some-
times by driving a nail into a board).
 Sheloshim: This is the 30-day period following the burial of the loved
one. It marks the end of formal mourning for all loved ones other than
the deceased’s parents (for whom the mourning period is extended
another 10 months, making a total of 11 months including sheloshim).
During this time, weekly recitation of the Kaddish in memory of the
loved one takes place at the local synagogue.
 Yahrzeit: This is the first anniversary of the death of the loved one
according to the Jewish calendar. To mark this anniversary, a candle is
lit, the Kaddish prayer is recited at the synagogue, and acts of charity
(usually in the form of donating money) are performed in memory of the
lost loved one.
At the end of the first year after the loved one’s passing, the family normally
meets at the grave site for the unveiling; they unveil a tombstone with the
person’s Hebrew name inscribed on it along with the date of death and often
words of praise and remembrance. The tombstone clearly marks the deceased’s
grave site, and visitors to the grave often place small pebbles on it (assuming
it’s not upright) to mark their visits.
274
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 
What makes an Abrahamic faith?
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all known as
Abrahamic faiths because each regards Abraham
as a patriarch of the faith and traces its monothe-
istic beliefs to Abraham’s vision and experience
of God as described in various scriptures.
In addition, both the Hebrew and Arabian peo-
ples count Abraham as their ancestor (that is,
their literal father). The Arabian people trace
their lineage through Abraham’s firstborn son,
Ishmael, and the Hebrew people trace their
ancestry through his second-born son, Isaac.
For Christians, Abraham is more of a spiritual
father, foreshadowing God’s sacrifice of His son,
Jesus, in Abraham’s binding of Isaac for sacri-
fice as a burnt offering at God’s command (see
Genesis 22:1–18).

Death in Christian Traditions
Christianity is a unique blend of monotheism and eschatology (from the
Greek meaning “last” or “farthest teachings” that describes beliefs concern-
ing the end times and final events in human history). The faith inherited both
these traits from the practices of Judaism, the religion of Christianity’s
founder, Jesus of Nazareth. The adherents of Christianity consider Jesus to
be God’s Messiah (thus his title, Christ, Greek for “anointed,” describing the
anointing of a king), which was described by earlier Jewish prophets. As
such, Jesus’s appearance on earth and teachings are believed to have initi-
ated the end times, although the world to come (olam ha-ba, what Jesus
called the Kingdom of God) with the resurrection of the dead and the final
judgment will only be initiated when Jesus returns to earth in glory.
Unlike Judaism, Christianity actively seeks converts based on the idea that it
offers the only true way to worship God. As such, Christianity maintains that
it constitutes a new covenant with God — one that supersedes God’s original
agreement with the Hebrew people. This new convenant (testament) isn’t
based on ethnicity but rather on faith in Jesus as God’s Messiah as well as his
resurrection and assumption into heaven after death by Roman crucifixion.
The purpose of life and 
death in Christianity
Christians believe that they’re saved by means of their faith in Jesus Christ
and are rewarded by eternal life in the form of a resurrected, incorruptible
body. The only fuzzy part of the afterlife equation comes in the question of
whether or not this eternal life is rewarded individually to the faithful at the
time of their deaths or collectively only at the time when Jesus initiates the
Kingdom of God with his return to earth in glory. (The former view has gained
275
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions
A little about the Kaddish
The Kaddish is a prayer in Aramaic (the com-
monly spoken tongue derived from classic
Hebrew) inspired by a passage in Ezekiel
(Ezekiel 38:28). The passage looks to the day in
which all nations exalt the name of God. Even
though the text makes no mention of death or
the afterlife, this prayer is commonly associated
with death because one version is recited at
burial and another during the traditional mourn-
ing period.

much more popularity than the latter among both clergy and faithful as the
time between Jesus’s first appearance on earth and his second coming
increases.)
The purpose of a Christian life is to emulate Christ’s life and the Kingdom of
God (as described by Jesus’s teachings in Christian scripture) until he returns
and actually brings this kingdom into being on earth. Primary among these
teachings is the instruction to love one another as God loves us (a virtue
called caritas in Latin that became more widely known as Christian charity).
When it comes to the treatment and burying of the dead, Christianity is much
less ritualized than Judaism. Following Judaism’s customs, Christians gener-
ally prefer to bury their dead (although cremation isn’t strictly forbidden as
in Judaism). This burial is to take place as soon as practical after the death
and may be done on Sunday, the Christian day of rest and worship.
Typical Christian grieving rituals
Christian rituals for grieving the dead aren’t nearly as strict as in the parent
religion of Judaism. For the most part, Christians restrict their formal mourn-
ing to the following two events:
 Wake: The public viewing of the body in the casket, usually at the funeral
parlor shortly before burial. The casket is normally open unless the
body has suffered irreparable harm or the deceased expressed wishes
for a closed casket. In the case of cremation of the body, the wake either
does not take place or, if it does, a picture of the deceased is used in
place of a casket.
 Funeral: This may include a religious ceremony in a church before burial
or a ceremony at the grave site immediately prior to interment of the
body. In the case of cremation of the body, the funeral is restricted to a
church service.
Condolences for the grieving family are relayed either at the wake in the
funeral home, after the funeral ceremony at the grave site, or at a gathering at
the family home immediately following the funeral.
In addition, the following formal rites are given to the Christian dead in the
Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions:
 Requiem Mass in the Roman Catholic Church: A commemorative service
is held in memory of the deceased following the formal liturgy of the
Requiem Mass that prays that God grant eternal peace to the dead.
 Panikhidi in the Eastern Orthodox Church: Commemorative services for
the deceased are held 3, 8, and 40 days after the funeral. These services,
which include the recitation of psalms and short anthems, mark the pas-
276
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

sage of the soul, which is said to spend its first three days grieving its own
death and roaming the earth. After three days, the soul’s Guardian Angel
brings it into the presence of God, after which the soul spends the next five
days viewing the souls of the elect in heaven and the next month viewing
the tormented souls of the damned before the day of its own judgment.
Death in Islam
Although Islam (which means “submission” and “peace”) is the youngest
Abrahamic faith, this world religion actually claims to represent the original
and therefore purest form of all three monotheistic faiths. Islam was founded
by Muhammad (peace be upon him — abbreviated after this as pbuh) in the
mid–sixth century CE. Muhammad (pbuh) is considered to be the last of
God’s prophets in the long line of divine messengers stretching back to
Abraham and including Moses and Jesus. He’s also considered to be the
recipient of God’s word dictated in Arabic by the Angel Gabriel, which
Muhammad (pbuh) then transcribed in a series of 114 chapters (surahs)
known collectively as the Qur’an.
Like Christianity, Islam actively seeks converts to what it considers to be the
one true form of monotheism (considering both Judaism and Christianity as
having fallen short of the original monotheistic vision of Abraham, Moses,
and Jesus).
Tenets of Islam and the purpose 
of life and death
According to the Sunni (“tradition”) denomination of Islam, in order for a
person to be a Muslim (an adherent of Islam), he or she must adhere to the
following so-called Five Pillars of Islam:
 Shahada (two testimonies): This is the profession of faith in God (Allah
in Arabic) and Muhammad (pbuh) as His messenger. Shahada is often
recited as part of prayer and must be recited publicly before an Imam
(leader) in order for a non-Muslim to convert to Islam.
 Salat (prayer): This is the requirement to pray five times a day at fixed
times facing the direction of the Kaaba located inside the Sacred
Mosque (Al-Masjid al-Haram in Arabic) in the city of Mecca in modern-
day Saudi Arabia (this direction is known as the qibla).
The Kaaba (which means “cube” in Arabic) refers to the masonry structure
roughly in the form of a cube that’s said to have been built originally by
Adam and then later rebuilt by Abraham with the help of his firstborn son,
Ishmael, who’s considered the original ancestor of the Arabian people.
277
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

 Zakat (almsgiving): This is the requirement for able Muslims to give
charity to the poor and needy.
 Sawm (fasting): This is the requirement for able-bodied Muslims to fast
during the month of Ramadan (the ninth month of the Islamic lunar cal-
endar). During this period, they abstain from eating, drinking, smoking,
and sexual intercourse between dawn and sunset, and they’re also sup-
posed to put more effort into the practice of Islam’s teachings.
 Hajj (pilgrimage): This is the requirement for Muslims who are able to
do so to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once during their lifetimes.
The greater Hajj occurs during the month of Dhu al-Hijjah (the 12th
month of the Islamic lunar calendar), whereas the minor Hajj (Umrah in
Arabic) can take place in any month.
The Shi’a (short for Shi’at ‘Ali or “party of Ali,” the name of the Prophet’s 
son-in-law) denomination of Islam adds to this list Jihad (which means “exert
utmost effort,” “struggle,” or “strive”) and four other commandments to make
up what it refers to as the ten Branches of Religion.
To some Muslims, Jihad refers to the inward spiritual struggle to be closer to
God and better follow His will; to others it refers to the mobilization of out-
ward energies to serve the needs of the collective nations of Islam. Still other
Muslims interpret Jihad as participation in the military struggle to expand
the influence of the nations of Islam (the so-called fatah or “opening”).
According to Islam, the purpose of human life is to enter into a direct rela-
tionship with God through the practices outlined in the Five Pillars of Islam
and the ten Branches of Religion. Death, then, is seen as the culmination of
this ongoing relationship with God; it’s the point in which the devotee is
united with the object of his devotion.
Islamic burial customs
Islam follows Judaism in the following burial practices:
 The person’s body is always buried. (Cremation is against Islamic law.)
 The burial takes place as quickly as possible after death (the same day
whenever feasible).
 The person’s body is ritually cleansed prior to burial.
Ritual cleansing of the body before burial is performed by a family member
or by specialized washers who are the same gender as the deceased (it can’t
be performed by a non-Muslim). After it’s washed, the body is shrouded in
white linen that’s free of knots (as these might interfere with the soul’s escape
278
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

from the body). The body is then buried only in these shrouds without any
type of coffin.
Conducting the appropriate ceremony
Before the burial, a short ceremony takes place in which a congregation of
friends and family assemble to say their private farewells to the deceased.
This ceremony can take place in any number of settings ranging from the local
mosque to the grave site or funeral home. At the start of the ceremony, the
cloth covering the deceased’s head is folded to one side, allowing the people
assembled to see the deceased’s face one final time while making their
farewells. When making their farewells, it’s important that no one touches the
body or allows any of their tears to fall upon it and thus undo its purity.
During this ceremony, prayers are said for the deceased and he is forgiven
his sins by the entire congregation.
At the end of the ceremony, the Imam asks the congregation whether the
deceased is a good man and the congregation responds “good” in unison (no
matter how they actually feel about the deceased). The ceremony concludes
with the recitation of the Prayer for the Dead, in which the four praises of
God are punctuated by the congregation’s Allahu Akbar (“God is Great”).
Then the body is ready for burial.
Undertaking the burial
An Islamic burial is handled by a group of men who often are kin of the
deceased. These men convey the body to the grave site, lower it into the
ground, position it (turned slightly to the right with the eyes pointing toward
Mecca and the feet pointing south), and cover the grave with earth. During
this activity, the Imam recites verses from the Qur’an, and he remains at 
the head of the grave after the men have finished the burial and leave the
grave site.
According to popular belief, the moment that the last man involved in the
burial (other than the Imam) leaves the grave site, the deceased awakens in
his grave and is visited by two angels who ask him the following five final
questions (this is known as the anquish by the grave):
 “Who is your God?” to which the deceased answers “Allah.”
 “Who is your prophet?” to which the deceased answers “Muhammad”
(pbuh).
 “Which is your book?” to which the deceased answers “The Qur’an.”
 “Who is your Imam?” to which the deceased gives the name of his Imam.
 “Which is your qibla (prayer direction)?” to which the deceased answers
“Mecca.”
279
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

Because the dead has only recently awakened, he may have trouble answer-
ing these questions even when he knows all the answers. That’s why the Imam
remains at the grave site after the other men leave; the Imam aids the deceased.
Those who are able to successfully answer the five questions are said to lie in
their graves in bliss until the final days of judgment.
According to the official teachings of Islam, the dead remain in their graves
until the Day of Resurrection (Al-Qiyamah in Arabic), which is equivalent 
to the Last Judgment or Judgment Day in Christianity. On this day, all of
mankind is gathered together and each is judged according to his or her
deeds and consigned either to one of the seven levels of Jannah (paradise) or
Jahannam (hell).
Typical mourning rituals 
in Islamic cultures
Because Islam, like Christianity, is embraced by many people in very different
cultures around the world, its mourning rituals aren’t nearly as uniform as
those in Judaism. On the whole, however, the traditional outward expression
of grief in Islamic countries falls more on the women of the family than the
men. This tradition holds true when saying farewell to the deceased as well
as when he is buried.
Women’s formal mourning rituals may include a change of clothing (black is
the mourning color in the Middle East, whereas white is the mourning color
in North Africa). Younger women may wear this mourning color for three
months following the death; older women may wear it for an entire year.
In addition, Islamic women often prepare sweet foods for special days, espe-
cially the 3rd, 7th, and 40th days after the burial. These treats are distributed
to people in the community who then are supposed to offer up sweet
thoughts for the deceased.
For those who mark these three days, the 40th day is by far the most signifi-
cant. It’s marked by a recitation of the story of the Prophet’s birth during
which many shed tears and for which many believe the spirit of the deceased
returns to listen.
In some Islamic cultures, it’s also customary to hold a ceremony on the one-
year anniversary of the death and to mark a visit to the grave site by leaving
a pebble on the grave. Both of these traditions are similar to practices in
Judaism.
280
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

Death in Hinduism
Hinduism (sanatana dharma or “eternal duty or order” in Sanskrit) is an
ancient and heterogeneous religious tradition of India. Despite claiming that
its followers worship more gods and goddesses than in any other religion,
Hinduism sees itself as essentially a monotheistic faith. This apparent contra-
diction is resolved by the belief that all the various deities are simply forms
of the one reality called Brahman (from the root brh meaning “to expand”).
However, unlike God of the monotheistic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam who is always conceived of as a masculine personal deity, Brahman is
considered beyond all personality and gender. As such, it’s looked on as the
ultimate repository of all consciousness and the unchanging source from
which everything springs and to which everything eventually returns.
Hinduism is like Judaism in that it seeks no converts to its faith. This is
because the religion regards itself as the unique spiritual heritage of the
Hindu people. As such, Hinduism doesn’t consider its teachings and prac-
tices as the only sanctioned way to achieve unity with the divine but rather
as the particularly Hindu experience of this spiritual journey.
The purpose of life and death in Hinduism
Hindus believe that the goals of human life encompass the following four
broad categories:
 Kama (pleasure): Includes the pursuit of sensual and sexual desires as
well as artistic and aesthetic pleasure
 Artha (goals): Includes the pursuit of material well-being, skills, and per-
sonal and familial goals
 Dharma (religious and moral duties): Includes the pursuit of righteous-
ness, virtue, and religious obligations
 Moksha (liberation): Includes the pursuit of freedom from all worldly
obligations and desires (as expressed by kama, artha, and dharma) as
well as from the cycle of birth and death (samsara)
It is through moksha, the final goal of life, that a Hindu achieves unity with
the ultimate underlying reality, Brahman. As part of this union, he realizes the
unity of the essential self (atman in Sanskrit) with Brahman and is released
from all worldly desires. In so doing, the individual also is freed from a chain
281
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

of ignorance and karma that causes his soul to be reincarnated in various
human and nonhuman states in this world.
In order to achieve this type of liberation, the Hindu pursues a spiritual prac-
tice or path (yoga, meaning “yoke” or “union”). There are several popular
paths in Hinduism:
 Bhakti Yoga: The devotional path on which one attempts to gain libera-
tion by worshiping Brahman in the form of a particular deity (such as
Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the preserver; or Shiva, the destroyer) or
an avatar (such as Rama or Krishna, both said to be incarnations of
Vishnu).
 Karma Yoga: The path of service on which one attempts to gain libera-
tion through the offering of his talents, skills, and resources to others
without any thought of recognition or personal gain.
 Hatha Yoga: The path of steadfastness on which one attempts to gain
liberation through a combination of physical yoga postures (asanas),
breath control (pranayama), meditation, and body postures that reflect
a spiritual state (mudras).
 Jñana Yoga: The path of knowledge on which one attempts to gain liber-
ation through the study of self and scripture and by direct inquiry.
 Raja Yoga: The path of meditation on which one attempts to gain libera-
tion by quieting the mind and body through the practice of meditation
(dhyana) and the recitation of mantras (chanting sacred sound symbols).
The function of reincarnation in Hinduism
According to Hindu teachings about the law of karma (cause and effect), a fol-
lower’s current station in life is the result of his actions and willful decisions
made in his past lives. So too, his deeds in this lifetime will determine his sta-
tion in the next life.
Due to this strong belief in the reincarnation of the soul (atman), physical
death represents nothing more than a brief break between one life and the
next. This continuous cycle of life and death (samsara) continues until the
time that one achieves moksha through the pursuit of one or more of the
paths to liberation, thereby completely terminating the process of rebirth.
Death, then, is often seen merely as a prelude to another lifetime that may or
may not be better than the one just ended depending upon the quality of the
life that a loved one led. The purpose of mourning the death of a loved one is
to help him achieve the best possible rebirth rather than to help him find
everlasting peace.
282
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

Mourning rituals in Hinduism
As in Judaism, the treatment of the dead and mourning are highly ritualized
in Hinduism. Indeed, the treatment of the deceased is considered to be a
sacred duty (dharma in Sanskrit) within the family.
When a loved one is dying, the family members remain at the bedside. When
it’s determined that the loved one is about to die, he’s lifted out of bed and
placed on the floor. The family members surround him singing holy songs,
and he’s offered water from the sacred River Ganges on a basil leaf. At the
time of death, it’s customary for the family members, especially the women,
to cry out loudly or even shriek at the top of their lungs.
After death, the body is ritually washed and shrouded in white linen that
covers every part of the body but the head until the time of its cremation.
Traditionally, widows remove their wedding marks (the sindoor) and close
female relatives dress in white mourning saris for a complete year. Sons of
the deceased often have their heads shaved completely except for a small
tuft of hair.
The rituals associated with the funeral extend for 12 days during which the
family members sleep on the floor and eat only vegetarian food. They also
undergo formal ablutions at both sunrise and sunset, sing their prayers, and
visit the shrouded body of the deceased until the time of the cremation
(which is determined by the priest through various astrological calculations).
On the day of the funeral, the body is anointed and garlanded with flowers
and led by procession to the burning ghat, where the funeral pyre is ignited
by the priest (or the eldest son in the case of the death of a parent). After the
cremation, the ashes are collected so that they can be scattered in the sacred
River Ganges during another ceremony.
After the cremation, in the case of more well-to-do Hindu families, the family
will pay to have local beggars in the area fed to benefit the deceased and,
after further ablutions, will meet with extended family and the community to
receive their condolences and to grieve with them. (Sometimes, a profes-
sional mourner is employed to encourage the public display of grief, espe-
cially the shedding of tears.)
Death in the Various Buddhist Traditions
Buddhism (Buddha Dharma or “teachings of the Awakened One” in Sanskrit) is
like Christianity in that it came out of a long-established religious tradition —
283
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

Hinduism in the case of Buddhism and Judaism in the case of Christianity.
They’re also alike in that each of the newer religions is attributed to a single
founder — Siddartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, in the case of Buddhism
and Jesus of Nazareth, known as the Christ, in the case of Christianity.
As a prince of a small Hindu kingdom in the sixth century BCE, Siddartha
renounced his royal and familial duties at the relatively young age of 29 in
search of moksha (liberation that he called “Nirvana”). After a six-year period
of rather strenuous ascetic yoga practice, Gautama renounced asceticism
and realized his goal of complete liberation in an event known as the Great
Enlightenment, after which he was known as the Buddha (which translates to
“Awakened One”).
As the Buddha, Gautama spent the next 45 years or so of his life teaching a
growing community of monks and laymen in northern India his particular
method of attaining liberation. According to the Buddha, the sole purpose of
his dharma (religious teachings) is to eliminate suffering (dukkha), thereby
attaining Nirvana.
Buddha outlined his fundamental assumptions about human suffering and its
elimination in the following so-called Four Noble Truths:
1. The Truth of Suffering: Suffering prevails in human life in such diverse
forms as birth, aging, sickness, death, not getting what one desires, and
being separated from what one desires.
2. The Cause of Suffering: The cause of suffering is a deep craving for sat-
isfaction and continued existence.
3. The Cessation of Suffering: Suffering can end through the abandonment
of this craving.
4. The Path to the Cessation of Suffering: The Noble Eightfold Path is the
way that leads to the abandonment of this craving and the cessation of
suffering. The path consists of the following steps:
1. Right Understanding: Comprehending and accepting Buddha’s
truths about the nature of suffering and its cessation
2. Right Thought: Renouncing suffering and all ill will toward oneself
and other beings
3. Right Speech: Engaging only in speech that isn’t hurtful, untrue, or
exaggerated
4. Right Action: Engaging in wholesome actions that do no harm to
oneself or other beings, including not taking life, not taking what isn’t
given to you, and not engaging in unwholesome sexual activities
5. Right Livelihood: Engaging only in occupations that do no harm to
oneself or other beings
284
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

6. Right Effort: Rousing the will to cultivate wholesome mental states
and overcome negative mental states
7. Right Mindfulness: Cultivating self-awareness and the ability to
see things as they are rather than how you want them to be
8. Right Concentration: Cultivating meditative states of mind in
which the boundary between self and others disappears
Unlike its parent religion, Hinduism, Buddhism actively seeks converts as it
considers the Buddha’s truths about suffering and path to liberation to be
open to all humans. As a result, Buddhism originally spread throughout its
native India and from there to all parts of Asia. Today, it’s practiced in many
modern Asian countries and has recently spread to the West, finding new
converts in Europe as well as the Americas.
The purpose of life and death in Buddhism
Like Hindus, Buddhists believe that beings are reborn again and again according
to the fruits of their karma (moral actions) until they’re enlightened. However,
unlike the Hindu belief in an indestructible soul (atman) that’s incarnated in
each succeeding lifetime, Buddhists believe that only one’s tendencies and the
fruits of one’s karma survive and are carried over to the new life.
Therefore Buddhists see death as a break in the connection between one’s
present life and the next. This cycle of death and rebirth (samsara in
Sanskrit) continues until one is fortunate enough (through the merit of his
good karma) to hear the teachings of the Buddha and actually have a chance
to practice them and become enlightened.
Human life is a highly revered state of rebirth in Buddhism because it’s consid-
ered a very rare state of being and, more importantly, because it’s a state of
being that offers some of the very best opportunities for becoming enlightened.
In many Buddhist cultures, the lay people who are householders and must
work for a living support the community of Buddhist monks (sangha). They
do so in hopes of gaining sufficient good karma that, in a future life, they’ll be
reborn as humans in a condition that enables them sufficient leisure to prac-
tice Buddha’s teachings and therefore achieve enlightenment.
Mourning rituals in Buddhism
Mourning rituals in Buddhism aren’t nearly as uniform and formal as in
Hinduism. They differ not only because of practitioners’ cultural differences
285
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

but also because of doctrinal differences of the particular schools of
Buddhism that have developed over time.
The two major schools of Buddhism are the Theravada (“the Way of the Elders,”
also called Hinayana, “the Small Vehicle”) and the Mahayana (“the Great
Vehicle”). These two schools differ primarily in the Buddhist ideal they
emphasize:
 Arahant (“worthy one”) in the Theravada school: This is a disciple who
attains final enlightenment in a single lifetime, following Gautama Buddha’s
example. As you may expect, the Theravada stresses personal self-reliance.
 Bodhisattva (“enlightenment being”) in the Mahayana school: This is a
disciple who achieves awakening but, out of compassion, puts off final
enlightenment until he has helped all other beings achieve enlightenment.
The Mahayana is much more comfortable with the idea of relying on
other powers in the forms of specialized bodhisattvas (the Bodhisattva
of Compassion being one of the favorites) and more cosmic, primordial
Buddhas.
Although early Buddhists tended to follow Hindus in preferring cremation 
of the deceased’s body over burial, this custom wasn’t followed uniformly in
all the Asian countries to which Buddhism spread. For example, because
many parts of Tibet lacked sufficient wood for cremation, the practice of “sky
burial” arose, in which the body of the deceased was fed to vultures and car-
rion birds. And in China, most people continued to bury their dead in accor-
dance with Confucian views even after the widespread adoption of a form of
Mahayana Buddhism.
In both Theravada and the Mahayana teachings, a person’s state of conscious-
ness at the moment of death is considered a crucial factor in determining the
quality of his next life. In keeping with this notion, some Mahayana traditions
created rituals for helping the deceased achieve the best possible rebirth or,
in the case of those with advanced spiritual training, enter Nirvana directly
and avoid being reborn altogether.
This type of ritual is most developed in the Bardo Thodol teachings of the
Vajrayana school of Mahayana Buddhism. As part of this ritual, the Bardo
scripture is recited to the body of the deceased (or to a picture if the body is
not available) on the weekday of the death for a period of seven weeks or a
total of 49 days (considered to be the maximum period that one exists in
between lives). This recitation guides whatever consciousness survives
death either to enter directly into an enlightened state or into seeking out the
most fortuitous condition for rebirth.
Other schools of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism mark a special cere-
mony on just the 49th day after the person’s death. During this ceremony,
286
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

friends and family of the deceased join together in chanting and listen to a spe-
cially selected Buddhist scripture before commemorating the lost loved one.
Venerating the Dead in Chinese Culture
In traditional Chinese culture, the veneration of one’s ancestors (commonly
referred to as ancestor worship) played a significant role in forming the soci-
ety’s attitudes toward death in general and the dead in particular. The basic
idea behind ancestor worship is that one’s family members survive death as
spirits that continue to take an interest in the family and have the power to
influence the affairs of the living. However, in order for the ancestors to inter-
vene positively in the fortunes of their descendants, those descendants must
keep their ancestors happy through a combination of rites.
In a traditional Chinese family, these rites include keeping an ancestor tablet
that marks the name and dates of the ancestor either in the family’s home
shrine or the clan’s ancestral temple. Daily rites of veneration are performed
in front of the ancestor tablet in which incense and spirit money (paper
painted with silver or gold that the dead can use as currency) are burned and
food offerings are made.
In modern Chinese culture, ancestor worship survives in the celebration of
the Qingming Festival (often translated as the Tomb Sweeping Festival in
English.) During this festival in April, the family members honor their ances-
tor by going to the grave site where they clean the grave, repaint the inscrip-
tions on the headstone or grave tablet, make food offerings, replace all wilted
flowers, and burn incense and spirit money. In addition, they place a set of
chopsticks and three wine cups above the food and closest to the headstone.
After pouring wine libations in front of the headstone, each member of the
family shows respect to the ancestor usually by bowing in front of the head-
stone. In some families, the members partake of the food they’ve offered the
ancestor (considered to be very good luck), making the affair into some sort
of graveside picnic. Families also may set off firecrackers to scare off evil spir-
its and to let the ancestor know that the family has come to show its respect.
Celebrating the Dead in Hispanic Culture
Although we normally associate ancestor worship with traditional cultures of
the Old World such as the Chinese and African cultures, it also has influence in
the cultures of the New World. Nowhere is this clearer than in the celebration
of the Day of the Dead (El Dia de los Muertos in Spanish). This remembrance
287
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

of deceased ancestors is celebrated on November 1 (All Saints Day in Catholi-
cism) in countries in Central and South America (it’s particularly popular in
Mexico) as well as in parts of Spain and the Philippines.
The day of remembrance is thought to have roots in rituals for the dead cele-
brated by indigenous American cultures including the Aztec and Mayan. (In
the Aztec culture, the celebration of the dead spanned an entire month in late
summer or early fall.) After the adoption of Roman Catholicism, the celebra-
tion moved to All Saints Day (November 1) and therefore became naturally
enmeshed with the New World celebration of Halloween (October 31).
Hispanic Day of the Dead celebrations are similar in some respects to
Chinese Qingming celebrations (refer to the preceding section). They include
visits to the grave sites of deceased ancestors; graves are cleaned and deco-
rated with flowers (especially the orange marigold referred to as the flor de
muertos or “flower of the dead”). Surviving family members make offerings
(ofrendas) in the form of food, drink, candles, and toys for dead children.
Ofrendas also are left out in the home as a means of attracting the spirits of
the dead. Celebrants also may wear necklaces of shells so that they make
noise and attract the ancestors’ spirits when they dance.
On the whole, Dia de Muertos celebrations are quite joyous. They’re a way
for people to honor the lives of their ancestors as well as continue this vital
relationship after their passing. These celebrations also emphasize the belief
that death isn’t the end of life but rather a new beginning.
Melding Deep Ecology and Daoism to
Create a New Spiritual Approach 
to Death
I begin this chapter’s survey of spiritual attitudes toward death with the
rather somber assessment of death as being seen by modern secular society
as little more than an impediment. In this section, I conclude the chapter with
a suggestion (a modest proposal, if you will) for a more accepting and appre-
ciative attitude of death, a new spiritual attitude built upon a blend of
modern ecological consciousness and some of the insights of the ancient
Chinese philosophy of Daoism (originally transliterated as Taoism).
 Deep ecology is a philosophy developed out of the modern science of ecol-
ogy. The basic supposition is that mankind isn’t endowed with any special
rights within the ecosystem. A corollary of this idea is that all beings within
the ecosystem are considered “aspects of a single unfolding reality.”
288
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

 Daoist philosophy, as expounded in traditional writings, concerns itself
with how mankind can best be in accord with the natural order (which is
named Dao, Chinese for “the Way”). The basic tenet of this philosophy is
that mankind should emulate the Dao by decreasing desires and artifice.
In so doing, mankind can nurture the world without attempting to pos-
sess it and can accomplish things without interfering with the process
(wei wuwei).
To me, Daoism and deep ecology seem to be natural partners. They share a
fundamental concern for nature and strong misgivings about how human
interference in the natural process can upset the natural balance. They also
both hold the natural process in great reverence and consider mankind to be
an integral part of the natural process without endowing humanity with some
kind of inherently special or superior status in the system.
In both systems, death is considered a completely natural phenomenon. In
ecology, death plays a crucial role in enabling the continued richness and
diversity within the ecosystem, thus ensuring its overall health. In Daoism,
death is equated with transformation and returning to unity with the 
natural order.
Once you regard death as a vital agency of transformation, death regains a
kind of dignity and necessity that it normally lacks in the view of the typical
modern consumer. In concentrating on the well-being of the whole system,
you automatically anchor and integrate yourself within a greater framework
and context that both sustains and guides you.
I suggest that deep ecology tinged with a little Daoist wisdom can stand as a
positive alternative to the cynicism of secularism and the superficiality of
consumerism. It can do this by providing the traditionally nonreligious
person with the following comprehensive beliefs:
 Human beings are an integral part of the natural system that creates,
supports, and sustains them.
 The purposes of human life are to appreciate and to nourish the natural
world.
 All beings in the ecosystem are precious to it and of intrinsic value
within it.
 The diversity of life in the ecosystem should be celebrated as a sign of
its underlying unity.
 Each human being has the moral duty to do as little damage to the envi-
ronment as possible and to sustain the diversity of its life-forms when-
ever possible.
 Life and death are essential processes of the ecosystem that aid in sus-
taining the system by fostering its unfolding and furthering its diversity.
289
Chapter 17: Exploring Grief in the Spiritual Traditions

As part of seeing death as a fully natural process, one can look to the Daoist
idea that death is just another transformation of life. Death just happens to
be a great transformation that’s shrouded in the same kind of unknowing that
precedes birth.
On the death of a loved one, you can counter your grief over the loss with a
deep appreciation of the unique life you were privileged to share as well as
appreciation of the Dao that brought forth and sustained such an exceptional
and irreplaceable individual. And in returning to the Dao, you can take com-
fort in knowing that your loved one’s spirit is once again reunited with its
source, as in the words of the modern Daoist sage, Tu Weiming, “like the flow-
ing stream returning to ocean.”

Chapter 18
Integrating the Loss
In This Chapter
 Making peace with your loss
 Findings ways to stay connected to your lost loved one
 Dealing with the life changes that death brings
 Using grieving as compassion training
I
have to admit that I cheated a bit in Chapter 1 when I purposely intro-
duced grieving as a process entailing three distinct tasks:
1. Acknowledge the loss.
2. Experience the grief that the loss produces.
3. Incorporate the loss into the rest of your life.
Another way to see it is that these aren’t three separate tasks at all. According
to this view, grieving actually consists of this single, very large task with its
own phasing and timing: namely, that of finding ways to successfully inte-
grate the loss into your life. This makes the first two steps of acknowledging
the loss and experiencing the grief simply part of the process known as inte-
grating the loss.
You may never entirely finish the job of integrating the loss into your life. And
although this fact may seem shocking at first and even a little daunting, you
need not take it that way.
It doesn’t mean anything dire — like you’ll never be happy again or you’ll
never love again. Rather, it means that you’re one of those lucky people who
enjoyed a relationship of such complexity and depth that it defies a quick
and easy reconciliation. (It may also mean that continually working on inte-
grating the loss is one of the ways that you keep your love alive.)

This chapter looks specifically at strategies and techniques you can adopt for
integrating your profound loss into the rest of your life. This process offers
you the opportunity to both renew and transform your life. It also initiates
you into a brand new club — the select group of people who know firsthand
that although death has the awesome power to separate you from a loved
one, it’s completely powerless to disband the relationship you created and
end the love you have. And at the culmination of this process lies an equally
great opportunity: the chance for you to transform your personal grief into
great compassion and understanding for others.
Incorporating the Loss into Your Life
Initially, the very idea of incorporating something as traumatic as the loss of
a loved one into your life may seem downright inconceivable. In time, how-
ever, as you go through your grieving process, hopefully you’ll come to see
this as both feasible and desirable.
In terms of profound loss, incorporate means to unite with something already
in existence to form an indistinguishable whole that can’t be restored to its
previously separate elements. In other words, this is integration par excellence.
Therefore, for you to successfully incorporate the loss of a loved one into
your life, you have to be able to live with the loss as though it were your cus-
tomary state of affairs (something akin to that “new normal” that grief coun-
selors sometimes speak of). To accomplish this task, you have to fully accept
the loss not only in the sense of acknowledging its reality but also in becom-
ing reconciled to it. And as part of this reconciliation, you need to find ways
to maintain some sort of connection to your lost loved one.
Reconciling with your loss
In order to be reconciled with the loss of a loved one, you have to restore the
harmony that was disrupted by the grief and be at peace with the loss.
Being at peace with the loss doesn’t mean that you’re finally okay with the
death in the sense of no longer regretting that it ever happened. (You’ll likely
wish that your loved one were with you and that the death didn’t have to
occur to your dying day.) This peace also doesn’t necessarily include ever
accepting the reason for the death and understanding exactly how it fits into
the grand scheme of things.
292
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

Being at peace does mean that you’ve come to a place in your life where the
grief no longer rubs you raw and its emotions don’t sit at the top of your con-
sciousness, making it all but impossible to think of or feel anything else. It
also means that you’re ready to fully reengage in your life — in all its mun-
dane as well as more creative aspects (what some grief counselors refer to as
“moving on”).
Giving meaning to the loss
One way to restore the harmony interrupted by your intense grief is to give
meaning to the loss. Finding meaning in the loss indicates that you’re looking
at its repercussions in your life, which means that you’re beginning to look
toward your own future.
An effective method for giving meaning to your loss is to employ a little tech-
nique known as reframing. Reframing is the process of finding new ways to
interpret and understand an event without altering or ignoring any of its
essential facts. When you reframe an event, especially a traumatic one, you
restructure the event’s meaning and therefore its consequences without
altering its underlying reality. The classic example of reframing is encapsu-
lated in the old tale in which a father tells his neighbor about his son being
thrown from his horse and subsequently breaking his leg. The neighbor
replies, “Oh, that’s terrible!” to which the father replies, “Oh no, that’s good
because when the king’s men came to induct my son into the army, they left
him alone because of his broken leg!”
To discover the meaning of your loss, you may need to be in a mental space
where you’re able to shift your focus away from the present pain of the grief
and the struggle with the reasons why this grief was laid at your doorstep. If
you’re not yet in this place, you may not be able to attempt this task. It may be
like trying to push the river when you just really need to go with its flow. You
simply may need to concentrate more on acknowledging the loss and finding
ways to vent and express the pain you’re feeling, as I outline in Chapter 14.
In the process of reframing your loss, answer the following questions:
 What kind of person do I want and need to be in the wake of this loss?
 What kinds of personal changes do I have to make in order to live with
this loss and move on from this point?
 What lessons can I take away from this grieving experience?
 In what ways has my life been changed forever as a result of this loss?
 How can I remain in some way connected to my lost loved one and still
live the rest of my life?
293
Chapter 18: Integrating the Loss

Finding meaning in the loss is essentially a creative task. It requires you to be
resourceful, inventive, and, above all, imaginative when it comes to your own
personal growth in the face of your loss and your understanding of its lasting
effects on your life.
In reframing the loss, you begin to replace the grieving process with the process
of restoring harmony in your life — a harmony that may have been missing
for some time. You slowly but surely replace the chaos of emotional upheaval
with a new order (that good ol’ new normal). Most important of all, you finally
recognize that you’ll be okay: You start to understand that you’ll not only sur-
vive this loss but also have the possibility of thriving in the face of it.
Looking at grieving as an act of love
A vital element of reconciling with your loss is to finally be at peace with it,
and one way to make peace with the loss of your loved one is to recognize
the grieving you’re undergoing as a supreme act of love.
Normally, people see grief as an entirely negative process, as the ultimate
downer (and in very many senses, grief fully fits this bill). However, when you
look a little harder, you realize that you grieve a person only because you
love him. You never grieve the loss of a person you don’t really know or
deeply care about, even if you feel a little badly or express some token of
grief at the passing.
So you should understand grieving as a way of honoring the love you shared
with the one you’ve lost. You also can see grieving as the first step in learning
how to keep this love alive beyond the loss.
When you come to see grieving as an indispensable process of loving, it no
longer feels like some sort of punishment. Rather, grieving reveals itself as an
initiation into the true appreciation of the love you shared. And that appreci-
ation enables you to make your peace with grief as you learn how to keep
that love alive in your life long after the grieving is over and done with.
Maintaining a connection 
with your lost loved one
Although death may mark the end of a loved one’s life, it certainly doesn’t
mark the end of your love for that person, nor does it necessarily mark the
end of your relationship with that person. After the loss, the supreme chal-
lenge becomes how to maintain a connection with your loved one that
enables you to feel as though your relationship endures.
294
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

Many newly bereaved people find that they maintain the connection with
their lost loved ones through dreams. Later on, these grief dreams give way
to other more-psychic or spiritual connections that enable them not only to
feel the presence of their loved ones but also to sustain some sort of commu-
nication with them.
Connecting via grief dreams
Grief dreams are very common among newly bereaved people (although
there’s nothing wrong with you if you never dream about your loved one).
Having vivid dreams about a loved one who’s recently died is so common
among newly bereaved people that grief professionals have separated the
dreams into categories that include:
 Visitation dream: Your lost loved one simply appears to you, usually in
a very familiar setting. He may or may not speak to you, but you recog-
nize him and are reassured by his appearance.
The visitation-type grief dream is the most common, and both visitation-
and reassurance-type dreams are the most comforting to the dreamer.
 Message dream: Your lost loved one actually delivers some sort of mes-
sage to you. This message may be in the form of pure information, some
type of instruction, or even a warning. In some cases, the message may
not be intended for you but for someone else that both you and the
deceased know.
The message-type dream can be comforting, but it also can be confusing
if the message that you’re given is cryptic and frustrating. This type of
dream is particularly frustrating when you awaken and remember the
dream but forget the actual message you received.
 Reassurance dream: Your loved one appears to you to give you some
sort of encouragement. This can be in the form of praise for the way
you’re handling yourself or in the form of letting you know that there’s
no need to worry because your loved one is at peace and doing just fine.
 Trauma dream: You relive a traumatic event associated with your loved
one. Often this flashback concerns the death of your loved one, espe-
cially if his death was sudden and violent.
The trauma-type grief dream is the least common and, without a doubt,
the most upsetting. This type of dream may be an indication that you have
serious issues that you need to address before you actually can grieve
the loss (see Chapter 12 for more information on troubled grieving).
As you can see, with the exception of the fairly rare trauma dream, grief
dreams are generally positive experiences. They reassure you that your loved
one is okay and still able to find a way to communicate with you.
295
Chapter 18: Integrating the Loss

The major drawback to grief dreams is that, for most folks, they don’t con-
tinue much beyond the period of acute grief immediately or shortly after the
loss of their loved ones. As such, these dreams are much better at providing
you with reassurances that your loved one is both okay and not actually lost
to you than they are at providing you with a means of remaining in contact
with him. Another frequent problem with grief dreams is that many folks don’t
remember them after awakening. They can recall distinctly having just had 
an important and vivid dream, but they can’t recall the details. This can be
really frustrating especially when you’ve had a message-type dream and can’t
recall the message your loved one wanted so desperately to impart to you!
The best way to avoid forgetting the contents of any visitation-, message-, or
reassurance-type grief dream is to write them down immediately upon awak-
ening. Be prepared by placing a pen and a pad of paper on your bedside table
before you retire for the night. Then immediately after you wake up, write down
all that you can remember about the encounter. When jotting down the con-
tents of the dream, remember that no detail is too small to include. (Trauma-
type dreams are often all too vivid to forget and are better off forgotten as
soon as possible.)
For much more on grief dreams, how to go about interpreting them, and how
they can help you with your grieving, I recommend Grief Dreams: How They
Help Heal Us After the Death of a Loved One, an excellent book by T.J. Wray
and Ann Back Price (Jossey-Bass).
Maintaining a spiritual connection
When you first think of maintaining a spiritual connection with a lost loved
one, TV psychic mediums Sylvia Brown, John Edward, or James Van Praagh
may come to mind. However, I’m not talking at all about using another person’s
psychic abilities to contact and continue communication with your lost loved
one. Rather, maintaining a spiritual connection means using only your own
abilities to find ways to make and maintain some sort of contact with your
loved one.
If you want to refer to such abilities as “psychic,” that’s fine. Just understand
that in this context, psychic abilities indicate nothing more out there than
finding and using your own subjective means of staying in touch — means that
are completely internalized and therefore can be verified only by you. Naturally,
these subjective means of staying in touch have to be spiritual in nature, if
only in the sense that, because the loved one’s no longer physically available
to you, he’s reachable only through unconventional, nonphysical means.
In modern societies where individuality is emphasized over community, you’ll
probably address your lost loved one in prayers, meditations, and rituals sep-
arately as an individual. In more-traditional societies where community is
emphasized over individuality, you may feel more comfortable addressing
296
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

your lost loved one as part of the clan composed of all your deceased fore-
bears and ancestors.
However you feel most comfortable addressing your lost loved one, the main
thing is to find a means of address that enables you to state your current situ-
ation freely and openly (including all your feelings about your grief and being
without him). Here, it’s crucial that you feel as though you’re being heard and
listened to regardless of whether your loved one or ancestors make any kind
of reply. Feeling that you can state your feelings to your lost loved one and that
you’re being heard will go a long way in helping you make peace with the loss.
If you create your own grief rituals (see Chapter 14), your rituals offer perfect
opportunities for you to address and communicate with your lost loved one.
You can address the loved one out loud (even when other friends and family
members are in attendance) without fearing that men with butterfly nets are
coming to haul you away to the loony bin.
Being Transformed by Grief
Like it or not (and most people hate it), grieving is essentially a transforma-
tive process. This is one way in which grieving doesn’t resemble a physical
injury in the least bit. For example, when you break your leg and that break
eventually heals, your leg is essentially the same as before (although it may
be a little bit weaker). However, when you experience the loss of a loved one
and your grief eventually runs its course, your life is never quite the same as
before the loss.
As Sobonfu Somé reminds us at the end of her great and wise little book on
loss called Falling Out of Grace: Meditations on Loss, Healing, and Wisdom,
(North Bay Books), losing a loved one is essentially an “initiation” that
changes our lives forever.
In looking on grieving as a type of initiation, you’re essentially admitting that
the grieving process constitutes both a rite of passage full of its own obser-
vances and ordeals and also an induction into a new level of knowledge or
wisdom. At the end of this initiation, this wisdom transforms you and gives
you a new lease on life.
Growing as a result of your loss
Here’s one thing I’ve learned firsthand from my own grieving: Whenever you
lose a loved one, you grieve the loss of that person as well as the relationship
297
Chapter 18: Integrating the Loss

you shared. And in grieving the loss of the relationship, you’re essentially
grieving over the changes forced on you by the unfortunate circumstances
with which you’re faced. Despite the fact that you probably weren’t ready for
your life to change in such a drastic manner, in the end, you have no choice
but to submit and adjust to the new situation.
Here’s another thing I’ve learned directly from grieving: Death forces far-
reaching changes in your life, but you still control how you make those changes
and how far you take them. For example, you can choose between merely
surviving the loss and getting through its pain, growing from the loss, and
using it to become a more complete person. In my own case, the deaths of
my life partner of 16 years and my mother in the very same year eventually
inspired me to complete my postgraduate education and get my doctorate as
well as to become a hospice volunteer.
Renewing your spirit
One way to grow from a profound loss is to use that loss as your reason for
renewing your spiritual connection to life. Surely anyone who’s suffered the
loss of a loved one is vividly reminded how short and precious human life is
and how empty and hollow so many dearly cherished goals of gain and mate-
rial success are in the face of death.
Instead of becoming embittered by the fact that life is short and many cher-
ished goals are momentary, I suggest you use your grief as a stimulus for
replenishing your spirit. Seek out every opportunity you can find to revive
your connection to those very things in life (such as love and compassion)
that are impervious to death.
Here are some suggestions of ways to replenish your spirit as the pain and
hard work of grieving starts to ease:
 Volunteer for a favorite community project or a project run by your local
church, synagogue, mosque, or temple.
 Take long walks in the country or a local park, during which you
expressly note the beauty and unity of the natural world.
 Take time to listen to music that you specifically find uplifts your spirit.
 Reflect regularly on the goals you have in light of the loss you’ve 
suffered.
 Get in touch with all those things that nurture you and find ways to
bring more of them into your life.
298
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

Reconnecting with family and community
Death is the great divider. It separates you from your loved one, and it doesn’t
stop there! All too often, the stress and grief it brings put people at odds with
friends and family. Grieving the death of a loved one also can isolate you from
the rest of your community and even make you question your trust in the
integrity of the world and your faith in the goodness of life.
Finding ways to reconnect with your friends, extended family members, and
your community is an important step in reconciling with your loss and inte-
grating it into your life. It’s a sign not only that your pain is finally easing but
also that you’re getting set to take the lessons learned from your experience
with grief and apply them in your day-to-day life.
Here are some suggestions of ways to reconnect with living loved ones and
the community of which you’re still a part:
 Begin or continue research on your family tree, eliciting input and help
from all your family members.
 Plan a family reunion to honor the accomplishments and contributions
of the elders in your extended family.
 Write thank-you cards to all the family members and close friends who
supported you and your immediate family after your loss and during
your grieving.
 Get involved in tutoring or mentoring young people at a local school or
community center.
 Invite close friends and family members to gather and help you erect
some sort of memorial to your lost loved one (see Chapter 19 for ideas
on memorials).
Grieving as training in compassion
No one who has the opportunity to love another is spared the pain of grief.
Only those who die so young that they never know the loss of other loved ones
manage to escape grief’s bitter embrace. So grieving is a great equalizer —
the one experience besides birth and death that all people have in common.
The fact that grief is such a shared human experience can make it a great
basis for developing and practicing compassion in your life.
You can’t be truly compassionate of the suffering of others if you haven’t
known that suffering yourself. Having experienced and survived the pain of
grief, you’re in a unique position to help others who are grieving.
299
Chapter 18: Integrating the Loss

The best ways you can help others who are grieving are by letting them know
about your experience and how you managed to survive your own pain and
by listening openly and without judgment to their feelings and doubts. Your
presence as someone who survived your own grief and who now wishes to
help others can be a mighty reassurance.
The biggest potential problem in extending compassion to others, especially
others who are grieving their own losses, lies with your own reason for help-
ing. If you help others with their grief as a way of making yourself feel better
about your own grief, you’re likely to get in the way of their grieving. Make
sure that your intentions are truly altruistic so that you can maintain the dis-
tance necessary to avoid interfering with their grieving processes and actu-
ally help them work through everything.

C
ommemorating is a process of memorializing your loved ones. You do
this by finding ways to remember, honor, and celebrate their lives as
well as the relationships that you shared with them. By remembering the
loved ones you’ve lost, you keep the love you shared alive and a vibrant part
of your life.
I begin this chapter with an overview of the ways you can remember lost
loved ones and keep their love flourishing in your heart. I explain the role of
memorials and memorial services in commemorating your loved ones, look-
ing at both traditional memorials (monuments and markers) and nontradi-
tional ones (butterfly releases and virtual memorials on the Internet). I
explain that memorial services can be anything from a formal traditional cer-
emony conducted at the grave site to an informal get-together with friends
and family at your home or at a loved one’s favorite hangout.
The chapter concludes with an examination of how you can honor your loved
one’s memory by creating a living legacy for him through various types of
community service. This service can include volunteer work that you do to
support your loved one’s favorite cause as well as donations made to your
loved one’s favorite charity in his name.

Remembering Your Loved One
Strangely enough, lots of people view grieving the loss of a loved one as essen-
tially a selfish process. This process is self-centered because, as a bereaved
person, you indulge in your sorrowful feelings mostly because you’re newly
deprived of the love and comfort that your loved one provided you.
I, on the other hand, see this same grieving process as basically unselfish.
According to my view, it’s altruistic work because the sorrowful feelings you
have over being deprived of this love ultimately serve the greater purpose of
helping you realize just what this love meant to your life and how you’ll go
about keeping this love alive.
As grieving reaches its conclusion, you may also reach the understanding
that your deceased loved one could be truly lost to you only if he were no
longer remembered. As long as you remember him however it feels right to
do so, you keep the love you shared alive.
“Remember” is really a wonderful word. It breaks down into “re-” and “member,”
which together literally mean “to get back an appendage” or “to become
associated anew.” When remembering a deceased loved one, hopefully you’re
doing both these things: once again incorporating your loved one into your
life as well as getting acquainted with your lost loved one all over again.
If you can do both these things successfully, I’d say you’ve found the secret
to keeping the love you shared alive and well in your heart. To help you in
this endeavor, you can create remembrances that reflect your loved one’s
qualities, skills, and interests. You can also construct remembrances that dis-
play and chronicle the unique relationship you shared together.
Here’s a short list of remembrances you can create to help you recollect and
celebrate your loved one’s life:
 Create a picture album or book that chronicles the milestones in your
loved one’s life, including major accomplishments and relationships.
 Create a collage or montage that uses images, tokens, keepsakes, and
mementos that represent your loved one’s best qualities and highest
interests.
 Write a series of anecdotal stories that chronicle your loved one’s goals,
major accomplishments, and interests.
 Paint a series of pictures that epitomize all that your loved one valued
most about life.
Check out Chapter 22 for a list of more-detailed suggestions of ways you can
honor and memorialize your loved one.

Memorializing Your Loved One
The main purpose of a memorial is to preserve the memory or knowledge of
someone or some event. When you think of memorializing a loved one, you
probably think of erecting some sort of monument or marker at his grave site
or place of rest. This type of traditional memorial usually also contains a
short inscription that identifies the deceased and very often his relationship
to the person or people erecting the marker.
In addition to or in place of these kinds of traditional memorials, you can
create more-innovative memorials for your loved ones. These nontraditional
memorials, which are gaining in popularity, can include anything from living
memorials and keepsake jewelry to online virtual memorials.
Erecting traditional grave 
monuments and markers
Most people are familiar with the traditional cemetery monuments and mark-
ers. Typically, these types of memorials are created and set in place at the
grave within the first year after the death and interment of a loved one.
Grave markers or headstones are usually made of granite or some other hard
stone. Most often it’s a single block that either lies flat or is erected vertically
303
Chapter 19: Commemorating Those You’ve Lost
Love lives on beyond goodbye
Shortly after beginning work on this book on
grieving, my beloved Sheltie dog of 12 years had
a massive heart attack and died in my arms. One
day a couple of weeks later, as I was taking a
walk and feeling particularly down about his
death, out of the blue, Foreigner’s pop tune from
the ’80s “I Don’t Want To Live Without You”
started playing in my head. I started singing the
chorus line to myself: “I don’t want to live with-
out you. I don’t want to live without you. I could
never live without you — live without your love.”
In that moment, I realized not only that I didn’t
want to live without my dog’s love but also that
I didn’t have to. I made my mind up right then
and there to take his love with me by remem-
bering him, all he meant to me, and all we
shared together.
Strangely enough, this realization made me feel
quite a bit better and made me understand that
this is exactly what I do with all the loved ones
whom I’ve lost. Every time I stop to remember
them, the love they gave me, and the lessons
that they taught me, I feel as though I’m no
longer living without them. Rather, I’m keeping
them alive in my heart and using their love to
help me be all that I can be.

at the head of the grave. It’s inscribed or etched with the loved one’s name,
birth and death years, and usually a short dedication or memorial passage.
A monument is typically higher and much more ornate than a simple vertical
headstone. Often, it’s intricately carved with religious or natural symbols
(crosses and trees are big favorites) and may include raised or even free-
standing statuary (usually in the form of the Virgin Mary or an angel).
If money’s no object and you have enough cemetery real estate and the ceme-
tery rules allow it, you can have a mausoleum erected as a grand memorial
for your loved one. A mausoleum is a stone structure that actually houses
your loved one’s tomb (or tombs, as the case may be, as mausoleums tradi-
tionally accommodate more than one crypt).
If your loved one was cremated instead of buried, you can still create a
memorial by having a special urn made for his cremated remains. Personalize
the urn by attaching a medallion or nameplate containing your loved one’s
name, dates, and a short memorial message. You can have this urn stored in
a niche in an indoor or outdoor columbarium at your local cemetery. Or if
your cemetery has an urn garden, you can have the urn buried and then have
a plaque erected on the site instead.
Creating more-nontraditional memorials
Nontraditional memorials run the gamut from ecological living memorials
and memorial gardens to virtual memorials that you place on the Internet. If
your loved one was cremated and didn’t specifically ask to have his ashes
scattered, innovative memorials can include lockets in which you store some
of your loved one’s ashes to using the ashes to create a synthetic diamond
that you can have set in a necklace or ring!
Establishing a living memorial
The most popular form of living memorial is the living tree memorial. For this
kind of memorial, you arrange to have a tree planted in honor of your loved
one in a nature preserve or on some public land. Some living tree memorials
enable you to select the type of tree that you want planted, and all provide
you with a certificate of planting. Some tree memorials also mark the tree so
that you can go and visit it, perhaps as part of a memorial ceremony. For spe-
cific information on agencies that offer living tree memorials, type “living tree
memorials” or “living memorials” into your favorite Internet search engine.
If your loved one was cremated and was ecologically minded as well, you 
can use his cremated remains to create a memorial reef. A memorial reef is a
304
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

cast-concrete reef in which your loved one’s remains are mixed. This cast reef
is then lowered into a particular location on the seabed off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. The reef provides shelter for marine life and is estimated
to last for many hundreds of years. For more information on memorial reefs,
visit the Eternal Reefs Web site at www.eternalreefs.com.
Wearing memorial jewelry
Many people find wearing memorial jewelry, most often in the form of pen-
dants, bracelets, and pins, a very comforting way to honor and remember
their lost loved ones. Several jewelry companies specialize in designing
memorial jewelry specifically for the bereaved. Some of their designs incor-
porate inspirational poetry, and others can be customized with photos and
other mementos of your loved one.
You can also wear memorial jewelry that either contains a small portion of
the cremated remains of your loved one in some sort of pendant or whose
gemstone is actually made from your loved one’s carbon. (These options defi-
nitely aren’t my cup of tea, but to each his own.)
Cremation jewelry usually comes in the form of a strung pendant that opens
to store a small portion of your loved one’s cremated remains. The pendants
are available in a number of different designs, including crystals and those
that look like tiny funeral urns.
Gemstones containing your loved one’s carbon can be created either from
the cremated remains or, if the loved one was buried, from a lock of his hair.
Called LifeGems, these gemstones are synthetic diamonds made from some
of the graphite of your loved one’s carbon. They’re available in a variety of
hues (including blue, red, green, yellow, and colorless) and faceted cuts. You
can have these diamonds set in a ring, pendant, or bracelet of your own
design. For more information on LifeGem memorials, visit the LifeGem
Created Diamonds Web site at www.lifegem.com.
Designing and planting memorial gardens
If you have a yard, you can design and plant your own memorial garden for
your deceased loved one. This garden should definitely include the types of
flowers and other plant life that were special to your loved one. If you have
the space, consider planting a tree to be the focus and the heart of the garden.
In addition to the flora in your loved one’s memorial garden, you can add
other personal touches to the garden, including:
 Statuary or fountains placed at strategic places in the garden to enhance
its features. The statues can be anything from likenesses of Jesus, the
305
Chapter 19: Commemorating Those You’ve Lost

Virgin Mary, Buddha, or your loved one’s favorite animal to abstract
designs that mean something to you.
 Benches to sit on as you and others enjoy the garden and remember and
commune with your loved one.
 Commemorative plaques containing your loved one’s name and dates or
favorite inspirational sayings and symbols of good fortune.
 Flagstones used to create pathways through the garden. You can make
personalized flagstones with stepping-stone kits available in most home
improvement or garden stores. You also can use specially designed flag-
stones with inspirational sayings or special symbols.
 Stones that you arrange to mark off certain areas of the garden. These
can be left natural or decorated with sayings, symbols, and dedications
for your loved one.
Posting a virtual memorial
Virtual memorials are memorials that you place online within special memo-
rial Web sites. Typically, a virtual memorial contains vital information about
your loved one as well as your dedication and remembrances. You also may
include a photo of your loved one and images or artwork that you think
appropriate or that bring you comfort.
The wonderful thing about virtual memorials is that they’re so easy to share
with friends and family (assuming that they have computers and Internet
access). Most memorial Web sites make it really easy to send a link to your
virtual memorial to anyone who has an e-mail address. The accessibility is
really convenient if your family is spread out geographically, making it impos-
sible to get them together for any other kind of memorial unveiling.
For more information on virtual memorials and to visit some sites to see first-
hand the kind of memorials you can create for your loved one, type “online
memorials” into your favorite Internet search engine.
Performing Memorial Ceremonies
A memorial ceremony can be as simple as gathering a group of friends and
family members for a dinner honoring your lost loved one (featuring, of
course, all his favorite foods) or as formal as a ceremony at the grave site
marking the anniversary of the death.
306
Part IV: Appreciating Grief 

The most formal memorial service, after the funeral itself, is one in which
your commissioned grave-site monument or marker is set up and dedicated
at the graveside. For some people, this is definitely a religious ceremony that
officially marks the end of the formal mourning of a loved one (which often
has little or nothing to do with the period of personal grieving). For others,
the monument dedication simply offers an opportunity to pay your respects
to the deceased loved one and visit the location chosen as his final resting
place.
Memorial ceremonies are often timed to coincide with other holidays and cel-
ebrations (see Chapter 16), but they need not be. If you’ve established a grief
shrine or a memorial garden for your loved one, you can conduct a memorial
service anytime the spirit moves you. Long after you finish conducting your
own grief rituals (see Chapter 14), you can still conduct your own informal
memorial ceremonies that honor your loved one and enable you to recall his
great qualities and contributions to your life.
Undertaking a Living Legacy of Service
Beyond the remembrances, memorials, and ceremonies that you can create
for your deceased loved one, you also can keep his memory alive by creating
a living legacy of service. Here are two easy ways to create a legacy of service
that honors the memory of your loved one:
 Volunteer at a nonprofit organization or in a community service that you
believe in or your loved one supported in life.
 Donate to the causes and charities that your loved one supported
(always make your donations in his name).
Giving back not only enables you to reconnect with your local community but
also enables you to continue supporting the organizations and causes that
your loved one championed.
In supporting the organizations and continuing to advance the causes dear to
your loved one’s heart, you honor his choices in life. Best of all, you get to
give something back to others in your community in his name, thus remind-
ing both you and them of his best qualities.

raditionally, the Part of Tens contains various and
sundry pieces of useful information related to the main
theme of the book, and this Part of Tens is no exception. I
give you tons of practical advice in the form of the top ten

grieving, as well as the top ten online resources to consult

as someone grieving the loss of a loved one, can do both
to give meaning to the loss and mitigate its effects.

Top Ten Clichés about Grieving
In This Chapter

I
wish the number of useless and often hurtful platitudes that bereaved
people have to contend with were limited to just ten. Unfortunately, in the
name of helping (and often simultaneously deflecting their own discomfort
with death), well-meaning clergy, counselors, friends, and other family mem-
bers have many more than just my top ten dreadful clichés about grieving up
their sleeves.
So, if you’re grieving the profound loss of a loved one, you need to prepare
yourself to hear the following top ten horrible clichés (or variations on their
themes) and more. And if you’re trying to support a grieving friend or family
member, you need to think twice about giving such simple, trite advice.
What makes these platitudes so hurtful is that they’re usually delivered by
caring people with the best intentions. Ironically, some of these little beauties
actually may be true, but I think that the biggest problem with them is that
their timing is all wrong. To be supported in grief, bereaved people really
only need to hear two simple messages over and over again, delivered in as
many different ways as possible:
 You’re not going crazy — grief just hurts that much.
 You will be okay. This agony is going to end someday.
No matter how true and well-intentioned, any other message you deliver to 
a bereaved person soon after a loss is actually pretty counterproductive.
Someday, when the grieving person has had adequate time to process and
integrate the loss, hearing some of these platitudes may be helpful (well, at
the very least, not hurtful), but now just isn’t the right time.

One last thing about these clichés: Most are intended to turn the grieving
person away from his feelings of sorrow rather than help him give voice to
and fully express them. If you truly want to help, be really open to this
expression and be able to listen to it. (See Chapter 21 for more suggestions
on how to help someone who’s grieving.)
I Know How You Feel
My gut-level response to the first cliché, “I know how you feel,” is “Oh no you
don’t. How can you possibly think you know how I’m feeling when most of
the time I don’t even know how I’m feeling?”
I guess this platitude is meant to bring comfort by having the speaker identify
with the grieving person he’s addressing. Unfortunately, it’s not really empa-
thetic or compassionate in the best sense. For one thing, it turns the spotlight
on the speaker and away from the griever, which is just the opposite of where
the focus needs to be if you really want to support your bereaved friend.
The sentiment behind this cliché is essentially a good one. However, its deliv-
ery needs some work. I suggest that rather than state what you know, you
question the grieving person about his feelings in this manner: “I can only
imagine what you’re going through. I’m here to find out how you’re doing if
you want to tell me.”
You’re Never Given Anything 
That You Can’t Deal With
This is a pious platitude that many people — not only clergy — use to try to
comfort you when you’re grieving. But as Rabbi Harold Kushner so eloquently
explains in his little gem of a book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People
(Avon Books), this expression is actually one that can be hurtful to a
bereaved person’s faith in God.
It’s intended to help a bereaved person of faith feel better by telling him (in a
theologically inept way) that he’s strong enough to pull through this terrible
grief. However, instead of comforting him, hearing this platitude is more likely
to make him wish that he weren’t so strong on the faulty assumption that if
he were too weak to bear the grief, then God wouldn’t have taken his loved
one away.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

This cliché is especially dangerous because newly bereaved people often try
to find ways to blame themselves for the death of their loved ones. Unfortu-
nately, the misguided logic of this platitude can play right into a bereaved
person’s sense of responsibility, and that only delays his grieving the loss and
makes his grief work a lot harder.
If your aim is to let a bereaved friend know that he’ll ultimately get through
this terrible grief even if that notion seems ludicrous now, you can accom-
plish it in a better way. Simply let your friend know that it’s your understand-
ing (from your reading, if not from your own personal experience) that the
loss of a loved one almost always feels like it’s too much to bear, but in all but
a very few cases, people do survive the sorrow. Further, let your friend know
that you’re here for him as a sounding board and a shoulder to cry on as long
as he needs you.
Time Heals All Wounds
This little truism seems to be the one that gets trotted out whenever you
suffer a loss of any kind, not just the death of a loved one. And like a lot of the
other clichés in this chapter, it’s based on a half-truth.
Time is indeed necessary for healing profound grief — in most cases, you
need lots more time than people are normally willing to grant you. But (and
it’s a big BUT, as Pee-Wee Herman was wont to say) it’s not the passage of
time that heals the grief; that job, like it or not, is one that only you can do for
yourself.
Grieving is your own unique journey in search of ways to make peace with
the loss of your loved one. Although grieving unfolds in time, it’s totally your
responsibility and work to do. This process is all yours to help along or
impede as you’re able and best see fit.
Rather than telling a bereaved person that time heals all wounds, you would
do better to let him know you understand that grieving takes time while at
the same time reminding him that eventually the intensity of the sorrow will
lessen as part of this process.
Don’t Dwell on It
I don’t know of any sillier grieving platitude than this one. After all, isn’t griev-
ing all about dwelling on it, the terrible loss you’ve suffered? In fact, dwelling
313
Chapter 20: Top Ten Clichés about Grieving

on it may be the only thing you still feel capable of doing in the wake of the
upheaval you’ve just endured.
Instead of hurling this kind of veiled criticism upon a bereaved friend or
family member, ask if there’s anything he can think of that may give him a
temporary but much-needed respite from his grief. Taking some time off to
recharge during this very stressful time is often quite a boon to the overall
grieving process rather than a betrayal of it.
Don’t Feel Bad
Well, if you’re not supposed to feel bad about the loss of your loved one, how
are you supposed to feel? How about enraged, distraught, or dispossessed?
Just wait a little while in your grieving and I pretty much guarantee that you’ll
feel all these emotions as well.
This dumb cliché is just a second-rate version of “Don’t dwell on it” (refer to
the preceding section) and a poor relation of “It’s time to move on” (see the
next section).
“Don’t feel bad” is one of those expressions whose motive is more than a little
suspect; it says, in essence, that you shouldn’t be such a downer because I
find it upsetting. This sentiment is simply no way to support someone whom
you care about and whom you want to support. Just don’t say this or any-
thing like it to someone who’s grieving the loss of a loved one. Enough said.
It’s Time for You to Move On
This second cliché about time (the first is “Time heals all wounds”; see that
section earlier in the chapter for more) is a bit trickier than it may seem at
first glance. There will come a time when it may actually be time for you to
move on, and, at that time, it may be quite correct for someone to tell you so.
However, if you tell a grieving loved one to move on — essentially telling him
to get over his grieving — before he’s ready and able to do so, you aren’t
helping him with a thing. Instead, you run the risk of alienating your friend
precisely at a time when he needs you and your support the most.
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The message behind this platitude is probably best conveyed to a bereaved
person by his grief counselor or psychologist (one who’s well-versed in end-
of-life issues) rather than by a close friend. Professional counselors have the
training needed to gauge when a client’s grieving is stuck and when it’s high
time for him to move the process along to its conclusion.
It’s Probably All for the Best
This grieving cliché has my vote as the most tasteless of the top ten. It’s full
of a kind of sham piety, and, worse, it hints at a kind of omniscience to which
few, if any, are really privy. However, the real reason this particular cliché is
so tacky is that whether or not the words are true makes absolutely no differ-
ence to the bereaved.
It doesn’t matter if you agree with the sentiment; for example, your loved one
suffered greatly for a very long time, so his passing gives you a certain
amount of relief tied in with the grief. This fact still doesn’t mitigate the loss
and mean that you grieve his death any less.
When someone actually meets the passing of a loved one with some sense of
relief, there’s always the danger that such feelings will fuel a real sense of
guilt that can make grieving more difficult. For this reason, if you know the
death of your friend’s loved one was anticipated for some time and brought a
certain sense of relief, you’re playing with fire if you voice any sentiment
close to this platitude’s.
It’s in the Natural Order of Things
Of course death is part of the natural order of things, just as love is. But if
death and love are part of the natural order of things, grieving the death and
missing the loved one must be as well.
Telling a bereaved person that profound loss and grief are just part of the mix
(a sentiment of which I’m guilty of expressing in a few places in this book)
isn’t really telling him anything new. It’s only the least little bit helpful if you
also tell him that grieving the loss is a natural part of love (a message that I
also try to get across in a number of places).
315
Chapter 20: Top Ten Clichés about Grieving

This cliché also carries an underlying implication that isn’t benign: Because
loss is a natural part of the world, you should basically adopt a stoic attitude
whereby you suck up the pain and get on with your life. That’s certainly not
the message you want to give or receive about grieving. In other words, you
need to stop reminding those around you that suffering this greatly is a part
of everyone’s fate.
He Lived a Full Life
You probably won’t hear this cliché unless your loved one lived a fairly long
life and, hopefully, one in which he was able to accomplish almost everything
he set his sights on. Although the sentiment of this platitude isn’t as grating
and insensitive as some of the others in this chapter, it’s still not particularly
helpful.
The negative implication is that you shouldn’t grieve so much because your
loved one had such a long and rich life. You have to admit that, on the sur-
face anyway, this logic seems sound. After all, it would appear as though the
death of a loved one blessed with a long and productive life wouldn’t be
nearly as difficult to accept as the death of a loved one in the prime of his life.
However, that logic doesn’t hold up upon closer inspection; after all, the
longer you spend with a loved one, the more you miss him and the more diffi-
cult it is to make the adjustments necessary to live without him.
I think that you can express the more-positive sentiment carried by this plati-
tude in a way that actually helps support a grieving friend. All you have to do
is say something like “Although you must miss your loved one terribly, you
might take some comfort in the fact that he lived such a long and happy life.
And, although they may not bring you much comfort right now, the memories
of all the great times you shared together will surely one day become for you
a source of great support and continued joy.”
Be Grateful You Had Him 
with You for So Long
This cliché is one that friends usually don’t burden you with unless your
loved one lived to a ripe old age before he passed on. (If you hear anything
like this from so-called friends when your loved one perished well before his
time, then you definitely need to get yourself some new friends.)
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

I definitely feel as though you should be grateful for every single day you get
to spend with your loved ones, so I don’t have any problem with the idea of
expressing gratitude for being blessed by love. However, I don’t know how an
outsider can judge when you’ve had sufficient time with your lost loved one
or shared enough love with another, so I do have a problem with the idea that
you ought to express thanks for the amount of time you end up getting to be
together.
Hopeless romantic that I am, I feel as though love should go on forever and
ever (actually, I make it clear in Chapters 18 and 19 that I think love does go
on forever or, at the very least, lives on beyond being parted from your loved
ones in this lifetime). The genuine gratitude for the time you get to spend
with a loved one isn’t something that can be foisted upon you by some dumb
cliché. This feeling of gratefulness comes in its own time as the pain from the
loss gives way to an appreciation for what you shared.
If you’re the least little bit tempted to voice anything close to this sentiment
to a friend grieving the loss of a loved one, do yourself and your friend a big
favor and put a sock in it. Any appreciation for the duration of the relation-
ship has to come from your bereaved friend in his own time and way. Any
attempt to suggest that this sense of gratitude will somehow help heal the
grief is simply a case of putting the cart before the horse. Fully grieving the
loss leads to the sense of gratitude, not vice versa.

The good news about trying to support someone who’s grieving is that you
don’t have to do anything special. You just have to be available and be yourself.
You aren’t responsible for your friend’s feelings (that’s his job), and you don’t
have to be able to offer him helpful advice or dispense any great wisdom about
life and death or the way the world should work (that’s my job). All you need is
genuine empathy for your friend’s plight and a willingness to support him.
Just Listen
Possibly the best way to help a bereaved friend is simply to be open to listen-
ing to all he has to express. I need to warn you straight up, however, that this
isn’t always as easy as it sounds. Depending upon your friend’s personality and
the depth of his grief, just listening actually can end up being quite challenging.

In the context of grief, listening doesn’t merely mean paying attention to the
words that your friend is saying or the emotions he’s displaying; it also means
paying attention to how he’s saying and showing them.
This kind of listening also involves responding to what your friend expresses.
The only caveat I have for you is that you try not to respond with a purely
abstract opinion or some ready-made response you found in some old rule or
etiquette book (see the section “Dump Clichés and Worn-Out Platitudes,”
later in this chapter for more on this point).
Respond from your heart and from your own experience. And if you don’t
have any experience to draw upon, don’t try to gild the lily and push yourself
to say something that you think might be helpful or sound wise. If you don’t
know, say you don’t know. And if you don’t understand something, ask for
clarification. Asking questions is sometimes one of the best ways to help
someone express his feelings and work through grieving issues.
Many bereaved people have a deep need to repeat certain grief feelings or
some part of their stories with their lost loved ones. Sometimes, hearing the
same thing over and over again can be very trying, to say the least. If you find
yourself getting fatigued and having more and more trouble actually listening
to something that you’ve heard before, it’s probably a sign that it’s time to
find other ways to support your friend and get other people to help. (Chapter
14 has information on getting professional grieving help.)
Don’t Worry about Saying 
the Wrong Thing
One of the biggest concerns that people often have in supporting their
bereaved friends is the uncertainty that comes from not knowing the right
thing to say. The good news is that there is no right thing to say. After all,
what can you say to someone who’s grieving the death of a loved one other
than you’re so sorry that he’s had this loss and has to go through this pain?
Even if you say something awkward or trite (see Chapter 20 for ten good exam-
ples), you needn’t worry. As long as it’s clear that your words come from a
place of love, you’re not sitting in judgment of your friend’s feelings (see the
section “Hold Any Judgments,” later in this chapter), and you’re not trying 
to influence the course of his grieving (see the later section “Don’t Push an
Agenda”), a few grieving faux pas on your part don’t matter all that much.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Be Okay with Having Nothing to Say
Sometimes it’s enough just to be with someone you care about. Sitting in
silence, however, is sometimes very uncomfortable and much more challeng-
ing than trying to find the right thing to say.
There may be times when your bereaved friend doesn’t really want to talk
about the grief or doesn’t have anything much to say. During those times, try
to remember that you don’t have to fill the silence.
Spending some time together quietly may be all your grieving friend needs
from you. Moreover, he’ll probably appreciate the fact that he isn’t feeling
pressured to speak when he doesn’t want to, and he’ll be very relieved that
you’re comfortable to be with him in stillness.
Be Honest
This suggestion may sound obvious, but people tend to forget. Being honest
is simply the most effective way for you to keep the lines of communication
open, encouraging the friend you want to support to fully express his feelings.
Remaining honest with a close friend in the midst of actively grieving a loss,
however, is sometimes a lot trickier than remaining honest with him under
normal, optimal conditions. Because your friend’s emotions are probably
more volatile than usual, you may find yourself editing your responses before
you make them in an attempt to ensure that they don’t aggravate or chal-
lenge him in any way.
A bit of extra sensitivity on your part is fine provided that it doesn’t go so far
as to impede candid communication between the two of you. If your friend
starts to feel that your responses to his expressions of emotion are not gen-
uine in any way, he unconsciously may start reining in the emotions that he
feels make you uncomfortable.
Although this kind of self-checking between friends may be fine under normal
conditions, it’s not at all what you want to cultivate in a period of grieving.
Your grieving friend really needs to be able to express any and all his emo-
tions (the conflicting ones as well as those that seem downright contradic-
tory). This free expression is a vital part of the process of working out what
the loss means to him and figuring out how he’ll eventually reconcile with it.
321
Chapter 21: Top Ten Ways to Help Someone Who’s Grieving

Hold Any Judgments
You may have one of those really tight friendships where you freely give your
friend advice on every subject under the sun from general appearance to
romantic relationships. But this is one time when you need to drop the usual
role of an intimate counselor and hold back on giving all that free advice.
Grieving is one of the most personal and individual journeys that anyone will
ever take. Advice on how to handle grief may work just fine for one person
but not at all for the next person. Moreover, grieving is one of those journeys
of self-discovery in which the lasting breakthroughs and changes almost
always come directly out of one’s own experience with his grief rather than
from the knowledge and experience of others.
If you come up with a great idea of something you think your friend should defi-
nitely try or steer clear of while grieving, don’t deliver this information to your
bereaved friend in the form of advice. Instead, open up a dialogue on the subject
by questioning your friend’s feelings about the idea. By asking him if he’s ever
considered a particular course of action or how he feels about it rather than
telling him to follow that course, you broach the subject while avoiding the risk
of making him defensive and interfering with his grieving process.
Dump Clichés and Worn-Out Platitudes
If you take a quick gander at the list of crass clichés I put in Chapter 20, you
see that quite a few expressions that you may have thought would cause no
offense and may actually be helpful to grieving folks are, in fact, not helpful
and may even be somewhat offensive.
My recommendation here is that, as much as is humanly possible, you drop
all old sayings, truisms, and the like when trying to support a grieving friend.
You don’t need to resort to somebody else’s kitchen wisdom to speak with a
good friend about the hard times he’s facing.
In place of other people’s so-called wise sayings, I suggest that you speak
from your heart and your own personal experience.
If you don’t have a lot of personal experience with profound loss, don’t worry
about it. Instead of making up stuff, admit that you lack experience and knowl-
edge. Then use that admission as an opportunity to ask your friend questions
about his feelings and the issues he’s dealing with at the moment. Doing this
can show that you’re genuinely interested in learning from your friend’s cur-
rent experience.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Try to Fix It
The normal reaction to seeing anyone in pain is to want to jump in and make it
all better — there’s a little bit of mother in everyone. This is one time, however,
when you should definitely back off and make no attempt whatsoever at set-
ting right the situation. This means you don’t have to come up with things
calculated to make the person feel better by taking his mind off the grief. This
also means you don’t have to try to figure out what this person needs to do
to get over his grief or to make the process smoother.
The pain that your bereaved friend feels over the loss is an integral part of
his grieving process. If you try to get in there and fix his sorrow and take it all
away, you’re robbing him of his necessary feelings. It’s inappropriate, espe-
cially after he’s already been robbed of his loved one. So, although it may be
difficult to hold back and not try to make all your friend’s grief disappear,
that’s exactly what you need to do.
Be Mindful of the Effects of Touch
Touch, as a form of reassurance and a token of the love you feel for your
bereaved friend, is really important and, in most situations, greatly appreciated.
However, you need to be mindful of the effect that your touch can have on your
bereaved friend, especially when he’s in the midst of expressing deep sorrow.
Sometimes just lightly touching a grieving person is all it takes to make him
break down in sobs. Other times, when he’s just about to break down or has
just started crying, lightly touching him shuts the weeping down completely.
Assuming that you neither want to bring on the waterworks or stop them cold,
be terribly judicious with your touch whenever your friend is in the midst of
expressing deep emotion. That’s not to say that there won’t be times when you
need to get in there and hold your friend for all you’re worth. Just check with
your friend first to see what he needs and feels would bring the most comfort.
On some occasions, your friend may actually need you to hold him through-
out an emotional upsurge. Be aware when you do this that many people feel
their grief emotions deep in their bellies. Your friend may therefore find it more
comforting if you put your arms around him from the back and hold his mid-
section tightly (this is best done with both of you sitting on the floor). Rocking
together is also often very comforting. Again, you always should check with
your friend to find out whether and how he wants to be held before you touch
him. Remember, he can always answer your yes or no questions with a nod of
his head even if he’s too choked up to respond to your questions in words.
323
Chapter 21: Top Ten Ways to Help Someone Who’s Grieving

Try Not to Change the Subject
Listening to someone you deeply care about agonize over the death of his
loved one can be really quite difficult (I’m talking excruciating here). A typical
reaction is to immediately try to change the subject in hopes of moving your
friend away from whatever’s causing him so much pain, thus making both
you and him feel better.
As natural as this reaction to move your friend on to a lighter subject may be,
it’s not a good way to respond to this situation. Although you don’t want to
force any emotion, you most definitely don’t ever want to shut that expres-
sion down. After all, the main way to support your friend in his grieving is to
provide an open, nonjudgmental space in which he’s free to express anything
and everything.
If you’re having a really hard time staying on track with your friend through a
particular emotional upsurge, take a moment to breathe deeply and remem-
ber that you’re neither responsible for his grief nor responsible for making it
go away. Then, take a new look at your friend and make another attempt at
staying present with the emotions he’s expressing. If you find that you’re
overcome by his emotions, let him know that and then give in to them. Being
overcome with emotion may be one of those occasions when holding each
other (after checking that it’s okay with your friend; see the preceding sec-
tion) can do a world of good for both of you.
Don’t Push an Agenda
Everyone wishes that they could just wave their magic wands and make all
the pain related to their friends’ grief instantly go away. But the worst thing
you can do for a bereaved friend is to try to impose on him your agenda for
how he should get through and over his grief.
Given that it’s not possible (and not advisable) to speed a friend through his
grieving process, the best thing you can do to support him is to give him all
the time and space that he needs to get the grieving job done. Remember the
following things about grieving the loss of a loved one:
 Grieving is a natural human process.
 Grieving is an intensely personal emotional journey.
 Grieving proceeds at its own pace.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Grieving moves in its own course.
 Grieving advances are often nonlinear.
 Grieving eventually comes to an end.
Only the bereaved person can figure out when his grieving has come to its
end. Like most other major transformational processes that people undergo,
the process responds to outside pressures but isn’t really guided by them.
Also, grieving is such a subjective and self-directed process that it’s very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for someone other than the person grieving to decide
its direction.

Ten Meditations Related to Grief
In This Chapter
 Focusing on breathing
 Working through visualizations
 Re-experiencing your lost loved one
 Letting love fill your whole body
A
meditation, as I use the term here, refers to a devotion in which you qui-
etly reflect upon a particular theme for some period of time. In the case
of grief, you contemplate subjects specifically linked to grieving the loss of a
loved one.
All the meditations in this chapter are guided meditations, meaning that the
text directs you through each step of the contemplation. Of course, you can
deviate from the suggestions in the text at any time.
The purpose of these meditations is to help you process the pain and sorrow
as you reflect upon the nature of your loss. In so doing, hopefully you come
closer to understanding the wider meaning of the loss to your life and recon-
ciling yourself with it. If you perform your own grief rituals as suggested in
Chapter 14, you can easily incorporate any of these meditations into the
heart of your ceremonies.
To get the most out of these meditations, undertake them in a quiet place
only when you have a specific block of time (five to ten minutes should do)
when you can remain undisturbed. To help your contemplation, dress com-
fortably, sit at ease in a comfortable chair or on a pillow, and have a picture
of your loved one on display nearby. If you feel it would help, light a candle or
burn incense before you begin each meditation. Finally, if you’ve set up some
sort of grief shrine or memorial in your home, you should conduct these
meditations in front of that shrine.

Breathing through Your Pain
This meditation is designed to help you remain present in light of the pain
and sorrow you’re feeling. It uses concentration on the breath as the primary
means for remaining in the moment. The meditation is recommended for
those times when you need some respite from the sorrow, and it may help
you stave off an upsurge of sorrow.
1. Visualize your loved one, and feel the love you shared.
2. Focus your attention on your shoulders as you settle down comfort-
ably into your seat. Then lower your shoulders and let any tension
you feel roll off them.
3. Close your eyes or just soften your gaze as you lower your head just 
a little.
4. Exhale slowly, letting all the air out of your lungs. Wait a moment
before taking your next inhalation.
5. Inhale slowly and completely. As you breathe in, imagine that you’re
taking in the affection offered by your loved one with the fresh air.
6. Exhale slowly and completely. As you breathe out, imagine that you’re
expelling all the pain you feel with the stale air.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until you feel ready to stop the meditation. Then
slowly open your eyes wide and look at the picture of your loved one.
8. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
Softening Your Aching Heart
Grieving people often feel a palpable ache around the heart as a part of their
sorrow. This meditation is designed to help you release the tension you may
have around the heart.
1. Visualize your loved one, and feel the love you shared.
2. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
3. Focus your awareness on the tension you feel in your chest, especially
around the heart.
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

4. Picture the tension you feel across your chest as ice crystals that
formed around your heart.
5. Fix your attention on your heartbeat as you breathe in and out, slowly
and completely.
6. Imagine that each inhalation brings in warmth that radiates out from
your heart and each exhalation expels coldness that appears as vapor.
7. Imagine warmth spreading out from your heart across your chest in
every direction as you continue to breathe, melting all the ice crystals
and dissolving the tension.
8. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
Reflecting on the Universal 
Nature of Change
Like it or not, change is the one constant of the world. This meditation is
designed to help you reflect on the all-encompassing nature of change in your
own life by looking at your own transformations from childhood to adulthood.
1. Visualize your loved one, and feel the love you shared.
2. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
3. Picture the first place you can remember living. Reflect on the feel-
ings that arise as you remember the layout and objects in this home.
Name the predominant feeling that you associate with this memory.
4. In your mind’s eye, see the first celebration of your birthday that you
can recall. Reflect on the feelings that arise when you recall this
event. Name the predominant feeling that you associate with this
memory.
5. See yourself in your mind’s eye at age 5, 10, 15, and 20. Note the pre-
dominant feeling that comes to mind as you recall each of these
tender ages.
6. Recall the first day you went to work. Reflect on the feelings that arise
when you remember this first day and first job. Name the predomi-
nant feeling that you associate with this memory.
333
Chapter 23: Ten Meditations Related to Grief

7. Picture the first person with whom you fell in love. Reflect on the feel-
ings that arise when you remember him. Name the predominant feel-
ing that you associate with this memory.
8. Picture the place where you currently live, your last birthday celebra-
tion, your current job, and finally yourself at your current age (assum-
ing that you’re over 20). Compare your current conditions to the earlier
ones, and note which feelings have changed and which ones haven’t.
9. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
Considering the Widespread 
Nature of Loss
Loss, like change, is a constant factor in life. This meditation is designed to
help you see the universal nature of loss by considering losses you’ve suf-
fered in your life that are completely unrelated to the one you’re currently
grieving. Its purpose is to remind you that you’ve already weathered and suc-
cessfully integrated many losses before this one.
1. Visualize your loved one, and feel the love you shared.
2. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
3. Think back to the first time that you lost an object precious to you as 
a child.
4. Think back to the first time you remember finding out that something
you were taught as a child wasn’t true, such as the truth about Santa
Claus or a myth about a family member.
5. Recall every time in your life that you moved to a new home, regard-
less of whether you made the move willingly or unwillingly.
6. Recall every job you’ve had in your life, regardless of how long you
held the job.
7. Recall every time a love affair you had didn’t work out, regardless of
whether you broke up with your lover or vice versa.
8. Reflect upon your ability to suffer all these remembered losses and
yet still survive to this point.
9. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Reflecting on the Timeless Aspect of Love
As I say elsewhere in this book, love doesn’t end with the death of a loved
one. This meditation is designed to help you reflect upon the aspects of love
you shared with your lost loved one so that you can keep these qualities with
you as you grieve.
1. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
2. Recall the first time you saw your loved one’s face.
3. Bask in the good feeling that the memory of this encounter 
brings you.
4. Recall an instance of a timeless moment with your loved one, that is,
an occasion when you lost all track of the time you spent together.
5. Bask in the memory of this timeless moment with your loved one.
6. Recall the love and affection that your loved one gave you.
7. Bask in the good feeling that the memory of this love brings you.
8. Imagine all the good feelings of these memories combining into a
warm glow that then slowly moves out from your heart to permeate
and warm every part of your body.
9. To conclude this meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
Practicing Lovingkindness
The preceding meditation on the timelessness of love should fill you with the
warmth of your loved one’s deep affection. This meditation enables you to
take that feeling of love and imagine sharing it with all others.
1. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
2. Recall your loved one and the love you shared.
3. Visualize this love as a ball of warm, red light that radiates in all
directions as it floats in front of you like a balloon.
335
Chapter 23: Ten Meditations Related to Grief

4. Imagine this ball of light growing large enough to encompass you and
your entire home.
5. Imagine this ball of light growing large enough to encompass your
entire community.
6. Picture all the people in your community smiling big smiles and feel-
ing good as they’re engulfed by this loving red light.
7. Imagine the ball of light growing large enough to encompass and hold
the entire earth.
8. Picture all the people in the world smiling and feeling at peace as
they’re engulfed by this loving red light.
9. Imagine the ball of loving light contracting until it once again is the
size it was when you first visualized it floating in front of you (refer 
to Step 3).
10. Imagine that the loving light from this ball now merges with you and
settles in your heart.
11. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
Holding a Lost Loved One in Your Heart
This is one of my all-time favorite meditations. In it, you visualize the loved
one you’ve lost sitting quite comfortably in the center of an open flower that
resides in the center of your heart, radiating feelings of love in all directions.
1. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
2. Visualize a white lotus flower or rose. Note that this flower is closed
tightly; each of its petals is in an upright position.
3. Gazing on the lotus or rose, you notice the petals of the flower begin
to open slowly and completely. As all the petals unfold, you notice a
figure seated comfortably in the middle of the flower. This figure is
encompassed by a brilliant white light that radiates in all directions
from the center of the lotus.
4. Continuing to gaze on the open flower and the radiant figure in its
midst, you begin to recognize the figure’s features as those of your
loved one. Looking more closely at the seated figure, you notice that
your loved one is beaming a big smile at you and is totally at peace.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

5. Visualize the open flower with the radiant figure of your loved one as
entering your heart and coming to rest there.
6. Feel the white light from your radiant loved one permeate every part
of your body.
7. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for all his caring,
and rise slowly from your seat.
Extending Your Compassion to All
The preceding meditation involving a lotus flower lodges your loved one
comfortably in your heart, and this meditation takes that contemplation a
step further by helping you share this love by extending compassion to all
other beings.
1. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
2. Visualize your loved one, and feel the love you shared in your heart
as an intense white light that permeates your entire body.
3. Think about all the other family members and friends of your loved
one who are grieving his loss. Extend the love you feel in your heart
to all these people by visualizing the white light in your heart radiat-
ing out and expanding to encompass and enfold them.
4. Think about any other people you know who are currently grieving
the loss of their loved ones. Extend the love you feel in your heart to
all these people by visualizing the white light expanding further to
encompass and enfold them.
5. Think about all the people you don’t know who are currently grieving
losses of loved ones. Extend the love you feel in your heart to all
these people by visualizing the white light expanding even further to
encompass and enfold all these folks.
6. Visualize this white light expanding to enfold all living creatures who
are suffering for any reason.
7. Conclude this meditation by visualizing the white light contracting
until it’s condensed tightly in your heart.
8. Thank your loved one for his caring, and rise slowly from your seat.

Chapter 23: Ten Meditations Related to Grief

Saying Your Goodbyes
This meditation is designed to help you if you feel as though you didn’t get a
chance to say goodbye to your loved one before his death. In it, you com-
mune with your loved one to say all that you still feel needs to be said.
1. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
2. Visualize your loved one as a radiant white figure sitting upon the
open lotus in your heart (see “Holding a Lost Loved One in Your
Heart,” earlier for details).
3. Direct all the affection and caring you have for your loved one to 
your heart.
4. Speak to your heart, conveying to your loved one all the things that
you wish you could have told him when he was still present in the
flesh.
5. Commune with the loved one in your heart as long as you need to
until you feel satisfied that you’ve conveyed all things you need 
to say.
6. Feel the white light from your heart permeate every part of 
your body.
7. To conclude the meditation, thank your loved one for his caring and
rise slowly from your seat.
Saying “Thank You” to Grief
This final meditation is intended solely for those who are near or at the end
of their grieving and are very deeply involved in the process of reconciling
the loss. If the very idea of being thankful for grief is repugnant to you, then
you’re not ready for this meditation and should definitely skip it and work on
some of the other meditations in this chapter.
1. Relax your body as you settle down comfortably in your seat. Then
breathe deeply, putting your awareness on both the inhalation and
exhalation.
2. Visualize your loved one, and feel the love you shared.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. In your mind’s eye, review the most significant things that you
learned from your relationship with your loved one. Then put your
palms together and give thanks for those lessons.
4. In your mind’s eye, review the important qualities that your loved one
demonstrated and that you wish to emulate. Then put your palms
together and give thanks for being exposed to those qualities.
5. In your mind’s eye, review the positive transformations you’ve under-
gone as a result of grieving the loss of your loved one. Then put your
palms together and give thanks for those changes.
6. In your mind’s eye, visualize the pain of your loss as a ball of cold,
impenetrable blackness that’s congealed in your belly. Immediately
visualize the white lotus in your heart opening and the intense white
light with the love of your loved one dissipating all the darkness in
your stomach as the light and its warmth spread to every part of 
your body.
7. Feel the warmth of the love you still share with your loved one as you
conclude this meditation by thanking your loved one for all his
caring, and rise slowly.
