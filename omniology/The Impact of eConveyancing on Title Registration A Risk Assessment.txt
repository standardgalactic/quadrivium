Chapter 1
Introduction
In this book is told a tale of two innocents, one who owned
land (he thought) and wished to sell it (he thought) and
another who had money to spend (he thought) and wished to
buy that land (he thought). Nothing could be simpler (they
thought). Little foresaw they the dark and dangerous depths
of the ‘wide and sometimes largely uncharted sea’ to which
they entrusted their ship of fortune (Farrand (1983), p. 3
referring to Lee-Parker v. Izzet [1971] 3 All ER 1099).
1.1
Context
Since the 1980s the passing of title to land by way of sale and purchase or gift,
commonly known as conveyancing, has been undergoing transformation on an
international and unprecedented scale. This transformation is due to the application
of technological advances to what was previously a paper based process. The
application of technology to this process, known as electronic conveyancing,
e-conveyancing or herein referred to as eConveyancing, has thrown up many
important issues for land owners and others who have an interest in the convey-
ancing process such as consumers, professionals, academics and policy makers.1
These issues include the roles of stakeholders in the process, the need for process
improvements, security, costs, removal of paper, incidences of liability and the
quality of title.
One of the foremost issues concerns the management of risk. Does the applica-
tion of technology to such a traditional process have any effect on the management
of risk? What, if any, are the actual and potential effects of this technological
transformation on the management of risk in conveyancing? Is the shift in technol-
ogy risk neutral? While the management of risk has always been a compelling
concern in the conveyancing process, with legal practitioners ﬁghting a continual
duel in the sale and purchase of property to protect their clients’ interests, how to

deal with existing and new risks becomes a vital and dominant feature once you try
adapt the process to a modern electronic environment. The development of
eConveyancing provides the impetus for change to the process that can have
unforeseen consequences on the incidence of risk.
eConveyancing moves the conveyancing process from being a paper based
system of effecting and recording transactions to a modern electronic system via
the creation and empowerment of electronic communication networks. The poten-
tial impact of this change on the distribution of legal risk in conveyancing trans-
actions with particular reference to Ontario and Ireland is investigated.
There are a broad range of different models and systems of eConveyancing.2 The
development of eConveyancing has primarily taken place in common law jurisdic-
tions and Ontario and Ireland are two common law jurisdictions that represent
opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of integration of technology into the
conveyancing process. Ireland’s Law Reform Commission has acknowledged that
the Ontario model offers the approach that best ﬁts the Irish environment.3
Ontario is recognised as the most progressive eConveyancing solution currently in opera-
tion and is widely acknowledged as a reference source for new eConveyancing solutions in
other jurisdictions. . ..The Ontario solution is the closest “end-to-end” eConveyancing
solution that is currently in existence with functional models such as: property registration,
solicitor communication facilities, online searches, online mapping functions and dealings
with ﬁnancial institutions.4
Thus many commentators have recognised Ontario as the oldest most developed
operating system of eConveyancing in the world and it was the ﬁrst jurisdiction to
introduce full electronic document registration.5
This analysis explores the perception that it is by far the most developed
eConveyancing system by articulating the key components of eConveyancing,
examining the extent of the Ontario system and comparing experiences in other
jurisdictions which have undergone reform in this area. These jurisdictions include
Australia, Scotland, New Zealand, British Columbia, England and Wales and
Northern Ireland.
By contrast Ireland is only beginning to develop the initial stages of its
eConveyancing project and thus has much to learn in order to take advantage of
advances already made in this arena. Ireland is entering a period of reform and it is
timely that research is done to inform the debate. The fact that Ireland is distinctively
behind many other states6 is seen as an advantage as it can try to emulate the successes
of other jurisdictions while avoiding the pitfalls that they have already encountered.
There has been widespread acceptance that eConveyancing is a change for the
better7 and certainly many beneﬁts of electronic advances in conveyancing have

Introduction

been articulated.8 However, many of these efﬁciencies and beneﬁts primarily assist
the professionals or state agencies involved in the conveyancing process. Writers
and researchers have to a lesser degree explored the impact on land owners and
third parties or property claimants. This analysis ﬁlls this gap by describing and
articulating current conveyancing systems in order to project the likely impact of
technological change on those with, or seeking to assert, rights and interests in land.
Risks are inherent in the conveyancing process and any change to that process
will impact on the risk landscape. This effect, where risks are created, re-assigned
or otherwise effected by the introduction of eConveyancing, is the impact that is
explored. Thus the word ‘impact’ in this context should not be understood as
referring to an empirical study. Instead legal, descriptive, analytical and compara-
tive techniques have been deployed in order to anticipate how, and to what extent, a
change in transactional process may unintentionally affect the distribution of
substantive legal risk within property law systems.
In effect this comprises a risk assessment constituting risk identiﬁcation, risk
analysis and then risk evaluation. The term ‘risk’ in this context is the consequence
of change and the likelihood of that consequence having a negative effect. This risk
assessment allows for risk management9 which can minimise or eliminate the
consequences and thereby the negative impact.
This is premised on the understanding that risks are inherent in the conveyancing
process10 and any change in that process, here the move towards eConveyancing,
will affect or impact that risk landscape.11
1.2
Focus
The management of risk in the conveyancing process in Ontario and Ireland is
investigated in light of moves from a paper-based conveyancing system towards
eConveyancing in these and other common law jurisdictions. While the primary
focus is on Ontario and Ireland the experience in other common law jurisdictions,
which have undergone reform in this area, has also been drawn upon. These include
8 Gahan (2008), p. 15; Wylie (2004), p. 11; Treacy and O’Sullivan (2004), p. 6; and Murray
(2004), p. 20.
9 It is interesting to note that Susskind identiﬁed the legal risk manager as one of the ﬁve main
future roles for lawyers. See Susskind (2008), p. 272.
10 No activity is without risk and action involves a judgement of the balance between risk and
reward. A higher degree of risk may be accepted if there is a greater probability of reward
depending on the parties appetite for or aversion to risk.
11 In consultations with stakeholders in Australia a preference was expressed for ‘no change’ in
risk and liability exposure. The risk assessment carried out by Sneddon and his team showed that
this would be unlikely given the introduction of new processes and requirements in NECS (now
PEXA) which do not exist in paper conveyancing. Instead a preference was expressed for the
objective ‘no material net increase’ which they considered to be the closest achievable objective to
‘no change’. See Sneddon (2007), p. 10.
1.2
Focus

Australia, Scotland, New Zealand, British Columbia and Northern Ireland. In
particular the move towards eConveyancing in England and Wales is referred to
as both the Ontario and Irish land title systems developed from that source.
Developments in land administration, title registration and title insurance are
also explored. Thus elements of property transactions in America, Europe and
Eastern Europe, Asia and Scandinavia are also examined.
Given the broad nature of the conveyancing process it is not possible to deal with
all the potential risks that might lead to loss in the course of the operation of a
conveyancing system (whether electronic or not). Thus, the focus is solely on risks
which impact on title registration and the security, protection or lack thereof that
this registration offers to land owners, third parties and property claimants.
Other aspects of the conveyancing process are not examined. These include:
(a) the pre contract enquiries generally carried out by transferees relating to
matters such as the size, physical condition or location of the property, outgo-
ings and services;
(b) the legal and procedural requirements for completing the conveyancing
transaction;
(c) the requirements to be fulﬁlled in order to comply with planning and environ-
mental laws;
(d) the mapping requirements laid down by the registering authority; and
(e) compliance with the law on taxation.
Other aspects of the conveyancing process are dealt with but only in so far as
they impose on the main focus; risks impacting on title registration. These include:
(a) the legal and procedural requirements for drafting contracts or deeds;
(b) the legal right or capacity of the land owner to sell or gift title to land;
(c) searches of the title register, deeds register, judgments12 and other registers to
establish encumbrances on the title;
(d) post contract enquiries.13 These relate to matters such as boundaries, rights of
way, identity, bankruptcy, possession, notices and proceedings relating to the
property.
(e) other enquiries to be carried out by the transferee so that he or she is on notice
of all the matters that are pertinent to the transaction14;
(f) the entitlement of a lender holding under a charge; and
(g) the legal and procedural requirements for registration of title to land in the title
register.
12 The term execution is used in Ontario.
13 In Ireland these are known as Requisitions on Title and are published in a standard format by the
Law Society of Ireland.
14 The law will generally protect the transaction from being undermined by anything that could not
be discovered by a transferee for value who carried out all reasonable enquiries.

Introduction

There are numerous stakeholders with an interest in the conveyancing process.
However, this analysis focuses exclusively on the risks posed to land owners, third
parties and property claimants. It excludes those with an interest in the process
alone, such as legal or other professionals.
This analysis also focuses on single residential conveyancing transactions. This
is where a typical consumer15 is purchasing a single house for occupation. Sale of
part of land from a scheme is excluded, as is the perspective of a developer or
someone purchasing a buy to let property. Instead the focus is on a consumer who is
a one off purchaser of a home. As Viitanen points out “it is easiest to ﬁnd the basic
elements of transaction processes in the normal house transaction of families.”16
Among rural families in Ireland this family home is often built on land that is gifted
from the farm and thus this scenario is also addressed.
The analysis is not concerned with problems common to the development of
information technology systems. Thus it excludes the speciﬁc types of problem that
are common to all electronic processes e.g. authorisation, identity veriﬁcation,
electronic signatures and passwords.17 These electronic processes and their associ-
ated difﬁculties are referred to but only in the context of shedding light on the main
focus.
Some risks may be affected by eConveyancing but are not produced by it
whereas other new risks may be produced by the development of eConveyancing.
Thus the risks examined are both novel and traditional.
1.3
Approach
The risk assessment is both descriptive and capable of identifying normative
possibilities for reform based on determining:
1. What is conveyancing?
2. What is eConveyancing?
3. What is title registration?
4. Who are the parties to a conveyancing transaction?
5. Who bears the risk in that transaction?
6. What risks impact on title registration?
7. What party is subject to that risk?
8. How is the risk impacted by the move to eConveyancing?
9. How might that party be protected in an eConveyancing system?
15 The law tends to distinguish between a consumer who is purchasing property for their own use
as a family home and a business person who is only interested in the property as a ﬁnancial
investment. The law provides more protection to consumers as they are seen as not having the
same business acumen as an investor.
16 Viitanen (2003), p. 55.
17 For an examination of these issues in the context of eConveyancing see Keating (2012).
1.3
Approach

10. Is such protection desirable and feasible?
11. If not, what other party should bear the risk?
The answers to these questions are arranged in terms of a clear unifying purpose;
risk and its incidence in paper and electronic conveyancing.
A broad international and multidisciplinary approach has been taken in that the
analysis draws from law, economics and social science literature as well as doc-
trinal property law. It examines not just black letter property law but also the policy
and procedure of conveyancing practice. Thus the approach is not restricted to an
examination of formal legal rules and includes relevant contributions from practi-
tioners and theorists from legal and non legal spheres.
Some difﬁculties were encountered as follows:
(a) the lack of an accepted deﬁnition of what constitutes eConveyancing18;
(b) inconsistent use of terminology by researchers and commentators;
(c) continual development of the law, systems, processes and procedures in each
jurisdiction.
There is a difference in terminology between jurisdictions not just in convey-
ancing but also eConveyancing and thus a new vocabulary needed to be generated.
This new neutral vocabulary has been articulated in Chap. 2 so as to provide
commonality across jurisdictions and systems. This neutral vocabulary provides a
set of clear deﬁnitions and minimises the difﬁculties caused by inconsistent use of
terminology by other writers.
This area of research relates to current live and developing eConveyancing
projects and thus elements are constantly being withdrawn and new initiatives
launched. This requires a continual review of the literature.
1.4
Method
In order to identify any relevant risks a transaction analysis is done through the use
of a model or abstracted process. This involves the creation of abstract or model
conveyancing transactions and the allocation of risk to the parties to those trans-
actions. The use of abstract transactions with abstracted participants generalises the
problematic and allows the risks to be identiﬁed and allocated. “The goal of any
model is to simplify and provide an abstraction of a complex and diverse world.”19
In this way “[m]odels are useful precisely because they abstract from irrelevant
18 Sneddon (2007), p. 2 says that eConveyancing does not have a precise meaning but encompasses
a range of activities in the process of recording, searching and transferring interests in land which
may be effected using electronic (or digital) communications and/or electronic (or digital)
processing.

details and thereby allow us to focus on the aspects of the domain we are interested
in.”20
Thus modeling is not used to give a detailed description of all possible real or
theoretical conveyancing transactions. Instead the concept of modeling is used to
illustrate the most general transactions and the most general relations between
different parties that arise during those transactions.
Sˇumrada explains that:
[m]odels help us to understand, learn and shape both a problem domain and its solution
domain. A model is a simpliﬁcation of the selected part of reality that helps us to master a
large and complex system, which cannot be comprehended easily it its entirety. The model
is intended to be easier to use for certain purposes than the complete system observed.
Models therefore unable (sic) us to organize, retrieve, examine and analyse data about large
systems.21
Visser and Schlieder point out that modelling real property transactions “is not a
trivial task. We have to model static knowledge (e.g. parcels, buildings etc.). We
also have to deal with processes, and we have to deal with abstract entities such as
rights.”22
The development of a process model allows for a theoretical, descriptive and
analytical examination of risk. This model is presented using visuals. This use of
visualisation23 in law is increasingly used as a means to present complex ideas
simply.24
The two most common conveyancing transactions are modeled; an arms length
transaction and a gift. The risks are identiﬁed, analysed and allocated to the
participants. This requires an examination of which of the participants suffers if
the risk leads to a loss. This impact on land owners, third parties and property
claimants is explored through the creation of abstract participants in the abstracted
model of the conveyancing process. The conveyancing process is examined from
the standpoint of each abstract participant thus examining how risk is distributed
between those participants.
This use of standpoint, as articulated by Holmes,25 Hart26 and Twining27 pro-
vides a framework for identifying the tension between different claimants, all
arguing for the upholding of their property rights. Thus the laws of each jurisdiction

23 For example, charts and diagrams. Lawyers tend to be expert at using language and words to
persuade and debate; they are less familiar with using visual techniques but these can be a powerful
tool of communication.

are considered from the standpoint of a transferor, transferee, donor, donee, lender,
third party and property claimant in order to identify the risks peculiar to each party.
This incidence of risk between the security of the transferor and donor or transferee
and donee and the security of those interested in the land (lender, third party or
property claimant) is examined in the context of the continual tension in a convey-
ancing transaction between dynamic security and static security.
This transactional based account of property law is expressed in the under-
articulated but well established practice of using an abstracted conveyancing
transaction to organise the law. Function is determined by transactional context
so this approach meets the needs of a comparative analysis.
Examples of the practice of this transactional type of analysis in the law of real
property is provided by commentators such as Hewitt and Overton,28 Williams and
Lightwood29 and more recently Farrand.30 These classic accounts of the law of
unregistered title conveyancing adopted this schematic focus for the law of real
property. As Williams and Lightwood explain the text is designed to discuss the
incidents of a contract for the sale of land as they are usually presented to the notice
of conveyancers i.e. in order of time.31 Thus the incidents are set out as a transaction
would unfold. Cooke and O’Connor32 provide a contemporary example in the use
of this organising technique.
Once actual and potential new risks are identiﬁed and allocated, there is an
evaluation to determine if the person to whom the risk was allocated (either by
design or not) should be protected from the effects of the risk being realised. If such
protection is not feasible or desirable then consideration is given to the allocation of
the risk. A number of choices are examined in determining the allocation. The risk
could be;
(a) left with the party subject to it; or
(b) re-allocated to another party or entity; or
(c) it could be socialised through the use of insurance either as a feature of the
system or through the establishment of a market.
This examination requires a comparison and evaluation of competing risks and a
determination as who or what entity should bear the risk. Thus mechanisms for
removing, minimising or distributing the risk are examined or the view taken that
the risk is worth bearing given other accrued beneﬁts.

Introduction

1.5
Scholarship
eConveyancing systems have not been extensively discussed in legal literature.
Thus this research is a ground breaking piece of legal scholarship in the Irish
context and more generally. This research is the ﬁrst research done in Ireland on
the incidence of risk in the conveyancing process in light of moves towards
eConveyancing. Thus it offers an insight into the possible effects of eConveyancing
on risk management in the Irish conveyancing system.
As Ireland is entering a period of reform in this area this research has the ability
to inﬂuence policy at a critical point. It will inform policy development and also
further academic debate as to the degree to which Ireland should make fundamental
changes to its conveyancing system in the move towards eConveyancing. It iden-
tiﬁes normative possibilities for reform of conveyancing in Ireland.
The design of this research involves the novel use of organising concepts
through the creation and articulation of a model or abstracted process to determine
risks in the conveyancing process. This abstraction provides a mechanism for
ignoring those aspects that were not relevant to the research in order to focus
more fully on those that were. While the use of models in property law is not
new they are rarely articulated.33
The abstracted model of the conveyancing process in this research is based on
modelling the participants. It involves the creation of abstract participants in
dealings with title to land. This is original within the context of the doctrinal law
of Ireland and in terms of methodology within the legal discipline. This modelling
allowed the separation of the descriptive aspects and the identiﬁcation of normative
possibilities for reform by exploring how things might happen thus revealing
emergent properties.

Legislation
All legislation will initially be referred to by its full title but thereafter Irish
legislation will be referenced according to the year of its enactment (e.g. the 1964
Act) whereas the Ontario legislation will be referenced according to its title (e.g. the
Land Titles Act).

Summary
This book is divided into nine chapters, the ﬁrst being this chapter by way of
introduction.
Chapter 2 explains in detail the methodology of the research and sets the
research in context. It also provides a neutral vocabulary for the research.
In Chap. 3 eConveyancing is deﬁned and the relationship between its constituent
parts is explored. The move towards eConveyancing in Ontario and Ireland is also
examined.
Chapter 4 looks at land administration, land registration, the nature of title
registration and the systems operating currently in Ontario and Ireland.
Chapter 5 sets out the model of the conveyancing transactions, identiﬁes the
abstract participants and their standpoint. It identiﬁes the risks borne by each
participant and categorises the key risks to be examined.
Chapters 6–8 then examine each of the risk categories and determine the impact
of eConveyancing. Does an eConveyancing environment lead to no change in the
risk proﬁle of each participant or is there increased or decreased risk? Who, if
anyone, suffers if the risk leads to a loss in an eConveyancing environment?
In Chap. 6 the risks posed by the registration gap and the formalities for
registration are explored. Chapter 7 looks at errors in the register. Chapter 8
explores interests off the register which affect title, the destructive effects of a
registered transaction and interests which are not recognised and not capable of
registration.
Chapter 9 is the concluding chapter. It provides an overarching view on the
impact of eConveyancing on risk and examines potential mechanisms for remov-
ing, minimising or distributing the risk or takes the view that the risk is worth
bearing given the other beneﬁts accrued. Finally it seeks to draw conclusions to
inform the reform process in Ireland.
All of this analysis is set within the context of moves towards eConveyancing
and developments in title registration in other jurisdictions across the globe.

Methodology
2.1
Introduction
This chapter explains in detail the methodology and provides a neutral vocabulary
thus setting the framework for the creation of the abstracted model of the convey-
ancing process.
2.2
Methodology
The methodology is primarily based upon doctrinal legal scholarship in the com-
parative law tradition. This approach advocated by Zweigert and Ko¨tz1 attempts to
use a functional analysis of legal processes to describe the substantive and systemic
aspects of different legal systems. There may be little or no convergence between
the systems and their terminology but many legal systems attempt to protect similar
interests. Only rules which perform the same function or address the same problem
can proﬁtably be compared. Similar concepts won’t have the same label and thus
researchers must move past the formal label into function. Thus an examination of
the function of the rules within each system must be carried out. Rules or laws with
similar functions, in this instance to protect different property rights, will yield
common ground for research.
Through this comparative study of the systems in Ontario and Ireland weak-
nesses and strengths are highlighted and any strengths of the Ontario system can be
followed and weaknesses avoided. As Ireland is in the early stages of
eConveyancing a comparative study is appropriate to assist in the development of
its system. Zweigert and Ko¨tz refer to this as modern comparative law developed in

the early nineteenth century which has a practical purpose, namely reform and
improvement of the law at home.2
Different systems are generally striving to achieve the same ends though often
by diverse means. Restricting comparison to similar systems may exclude other
better ideas but for such a comparison to be feasible there must be some common
ground between the items being compared. Ontario and Ireland have many key
similarities which provided the rationale for a comparison of their systems.
Ontario and Ireland are western developed societies and have long established
market economies. Ireland and Canada are members of the OECD3 and WTO,4
UN5 and IMF.6 Both have a tradition of democratic governance and achieved
statehood through independence from the United Kingdom. They have common
rather than civil law legal systems and are English speaking. The two jurisdictions
have a practice of secured lending for the purchase of property with a tradition of
relatively unrestricted freedom of lifetime disposition of property. Both jurisdic-
tions have a similar division between deeds and title registration and the model of
land registration for both Ireland and Ontario developed from the English system.
Thus a comparison of the systems in Ontario and Ireland is feasible.
Table 2.1 shows some key comparators between the two jurisdictions.
There is however criticism of comparative law and the view of Zweigert and Ko¨tz
that functionality is the basic methodological principle of all comparative law.7
Teubner calls this functional equivalence but he takes issue with it and argues
that attempts at unifying law8 or convergence will result in new cleavages.9 Legal
institutions cannot really be transplanted from a foreign to a domestic culture but
instead they become a legal irritant which,
cannot be domesticated; they are not transformed from something alien into something
familiar, not adapted to a new cultural context, rather they will unleash an evolutionary
dynamic in which the external rule’s meaning will be reconstructed and internal context
will undergo fundamental change.10
He is of the view that globalising tendencies produce new divergences as their
unintended consequences.11
Another critical view is offered by Legrand who is strident in his opinion that
legal transplants are impossible as legal rules cannot travel.12 He argues that law

integration and even uniﬁcation of legal systems is an old dream. See Paasch (2007), p. 167.

would need to be segregated from society to travel across jurisdictions and this
could only occur if law was a “somewhat autonomous entity unencumbered by
historical, epistemological, or cultural baggage.”13
A contrary perspective is offered by Watson who says we do legal transplant or
‘borrowing’ all the time and that “[i]n most places at most times borrowing is the
most fruitful source of legal change.”14 The reality is likely somewhere in the
middle of these two divergent perspectives though the failures of ‘borrowing’
probably generate more attention than the successes.
For example Meadows and Grifﬁn are of the view that previous title registration
initiatives were “perceived to have failed to address the speciﬁc requirements of
Bermuda and instead sought to impose an existing system from another jurisdic-
tion.”15 These attempted transplantation initiatives are blamed by them for the
failure to introduce title registration into Bermuda.
These arguments have merit however the aim is not to unify or converge the law
in Ontario and Ireland. If the aim was to ‘transplant’ the Ontario system in its
entirety into Ireland there is no doubt it would become a major ‘irritant’. While the

jurisdictions share a common history their legal systems are by no means the same.
Instead the aim is to learn lessons from the Ontario system so as to determine how
risk is to be managed in a system of eConveyancing in Ireland.
As Lepaulle has said “[t]o see things in their true light, we must see them from a
certain distance, as strangers, which is impossible when we study any phenomena
of our own country.”16 Sen also refers to the need to transcend the limitations of our
positional perspectives.17 He explores the search for some kind of position-
independent understanding but acknowledges that we cannot hope to succeed
fully in this endeavour as this is the view from nowhere.18
While acknowledging Sen’s argument this ‘view from nowhere’ proves
unhelpful in this context as it is only by looking at the conveyancing process
from the perspective of Ireland’s land law system that the beneﬁt or negative effect
of any change can be evaluated. As Chodosh points out decision-makers and
scholars cannot be expected to understand the foreign without comparison to the
familiar.19
Similarly Legrand states that:
unless the comparatist can learn to think of law as a culturally-situated phenomenon and
accept that the law lives in a profound way within a culture-speciﬁc – and therefore
contingent – discourse, comparison rapidly becomes a pointless venture.20
The act of interpretation of legal rules is embedded unconsciously in the
language and tradition of the interpreter.21 Thus law has to be looked at in context.
The context here is the conveyancing systems in Ireland and Ontario. The
functional analysis is based upon the management of risk in the conveyancing
process across the two jurisdictions and in particular the identiﬁcation, analysis,
allocation, comparison and evaluation of risks.
Despite the similarities between the two jurisdictions there are fundamental
differences in concepts and terminology. In order to overcome these differences a
neutral vocabulary has been generated. This clariﬁcation of terminology and mean-
ing sets the stage for the creation of the abstracted model to be applied across the
two legal systems.
The necessity for this neutral vocabulary to overcome diversity between the two
jurisdictions is explored initially before the neutral vocabulary is articulated.

2.3.1
Context
It has often been said that law and language are intimately linked, as language structures the
way we think and, consequently, the way we think as lawyers. . .It is accepted wisdom that
uniﬁcation or even harmonisation of the law is neither possible without the creation of
uniform legal terminology, preferably laid down in a limited number of ‘authentic’
language versions, nor without a superior authority (frequently a court) that is responsible
for reaching uniform interpretation.22
The lack of a uniform legal terminology and uniform interpretation also arises in
comparative law research.
Jurisdictions have differing systems with fundamental differences in key con-
cepts and terminology within that system. This presents difﬁculties for comparative
law researchers who wish to compare these concepts or terms across jurisdictions.
The question of the tertium comparationis or the comparability of the items of
comparison arises i.e. is comparison possible?
Ferlan and his colleagues recommend deciding at an early stage what the
comparison will entail and:
using reasonably simpliﬁed methods, to identify manageable and comparable conditions in
different countries so that the person making the comparison will not need to master the
whole body of each country’s property law. Comparisons have to be standardised, despite
the risks that this entails.23
Hence the importance of being self-aware in modelling conveyancing trans-
actions and the importance of identifying key concepts that perform the same role
across legal systems.
Fundamental differences may arise not just in relation to the systems being
compared but also the labels or terminology used. In addition even when similar or
the same terminology is used across jurisdictions the meaning assigned to that term
may be different. Transplantation of terminology and concepts may not prove too
problematic between jurisdictions in the common law family particularly where
many of the key concepts have continued to develop along similar lines. However,
such transplantation would likely prove more difﬁcult between jurisdictions with-
out these similarities though some commentators are of the view that “even in the
area of property law civil and common law share more principles and underlying
policies than meets the eye at ﬁrst glance.”24
Akhtar sees eConveyancing as the way of delivering harmonisation of European
property law25 but other commentators note that the “diversity of individual

economies and associated legal practices alone makes the concept of a common
land market model unrealistic.”26
Clancy acknowledges the impetus towards convergence but he is of the view that
comparison of procedures between the common law and civil law systems is like
comparing apples with oranges.27 He refers to the adversarial system in common
law jurisdictions where conveyancing is based on the principle of caveat emptor
versus the civil law system where there is an independent statutory ofﬁcial and the
vendor has a duty of disclosure. This independent statutory ofﬁcial known as the
notary or notaire acts on behalf of both vendor and purchaser and is an agent of the
State.
Many of these countries have complete eRegistration systems but will never
progress to full eConveyancing as there is little, if any, part of the conveyancing
process taking place outside the role of the notary. A clear example of this is
Estonia where the notary performs all the necessary inquiries and prepares all the
documentation which is digitally signed and sent electronically to the land registry
where it is automatically registered.28 Commentators often refer to these systems as
eConveyancing systems but a fundamental tenet of eConveyancing is the creation
of a central hub between multiple stakeholders both private and public, not just
between different arms or branches of the state.29
Clancy also notes that business processes can be benchmarked due to a common
understanding of the terminology but “[t]his is not the case with land administra-
tion, which operates at jurisdictional level and inherits terminology that is often
peculiar to the particular jurisdiction being evaluated.”30 Akhtar notes that real
property law is now one of the few legal branches which has remained essentially
national and in which differences among national laws remain greatest.31 Lemmen
et al. also point out the lack of a shared set of concepts and terminology between
cadastral32 and land registry systems.33
This lack of a shared set of concepts and terminology is being partly addressed in
Europe by the UN34 and the publication of a glossary of terms by the European
26 Dale et al. (2006), p. 3.

32 Stubkjær distinguishes between the cadastre with its spatial focus and the land register with its
legal focus. See Stubkjær (2003), pp. 227–238. The cadastre which exists in Norway and many
other west-European countries, once under the command of Napoleon, generally deals with
mapping, land use and land values for taxation. Land registration often sits alongside this cadastre.
Together they can be deﬁned as the land administration system (LAS). The distinction between
cadastral and land registry systems is explored further in Chap. 4.

Land Information Service (EULIS).35 Paasch sees this as an important contribution
in spreading knowledge of national real property domains to interested parties but
points out that it does not provide a fully standardised description of the informa-
tion.36 The UN has also published guidelines on real property units and identiﬁers
aimed at supporting efﬁcient and effective national land administration and man-
agement. The guidelines include a survey of the real property rights in 18 countries
in Europe which prove to illustrate a great degree of diversity.37
Another publication across the world wide stage is the Inventory of Land
Administration Systems in Europe and North America produced by the Land
Registry of England and Wales on behalf of the UN Economic Commission for
Europe Working Party on Land Administration (UNECE WPLA).38 Though this is
an inventory of systems and organisations rather than a thesaurus or glossary this
also demonstrates the diversity of real property rights39 and the disparity in systems
and processes.
The difﬁculties as they apply to property law are already acknowledged.
Zevenbergen and his colleagues note that the actors and procedures involved in
transactions in real property appear to differ even between countries with compa-
rable economies.40 Stubkjær and his colleagues, who were working on the same
research project, note that different legal traditions in different European countries
created terminological and semantic difﬁculties in achieving comparable descrip-
tions.41 Comparison across countries is difﬁcult because the same term may be used
differently and there may be no exact correspondence between concepts.42 Thus
clariﬁcation of terminology and meaning is crucial.
In order to address these problems Zweigert and Ko¨tz state that comparative
lawyers must cut themselves loose from their own doctrinal and juridical pre-
conceptions and liberate themselves from their own cultural context in order to
discover ‘neutral’ concepts.43 Thus rather than transplant and adopt the meaning or
term assigned by one system or the other, a new system neutral vocabulary can be
generated to incorporate the terms for each jurisdiction. Neutral vocabulary can
provide a degree of commonality across the jurisdictions and systems being

examined. The development of this neutral vocabulary increases the prospect of
ﬁnding parallel provisions or an echo of similar type provisions in each system.
Paasch is of the view that:
[t]he establishing of a standardised terminology for the classiﬁcation of the different rights
and restrictions would make it possible to ‘match’ the different real property rights and
restrictions existing in one national legal system with their counterparts existing in another
legal system, even if they are not created by the same legal process and have a different
terminology.44
This view demonstrates the importance of developing a common terminology
without distorting the systems being compared.
The lack of an accepted deﬁnition of what constitutes eConveyancing, incon-
sistent use of terminology by researchers and commentators and the difference in
terminology between jurisdictions, not just in conveyancing but also in
eConveyancing, thus required that a new vocabulary be generated.
This difﬁculty with terminology and scope is demonstrated by the use of the term
electronic conveyancing in a new cross border European initiative. This project
called Cross Border Electronic Conveyancing (CROBECO)45 was initiated by the
European Land Registry Association (ELRA)46 as a cross border transaction
scheme which allows purchasers to buy foreign immovable property in other
member states. The scheme provides a bilingual contract and allows the purchaser
to apply the laws of their own country thus protecting them against “the unknown
consequences of contracting a sale in a foreign legal system that is not familiar to
them”.47 The current focus is on English and Dutch buyers of property rights in
Spain and Portugal.
O’Sullivan refers to the fact that in some jurisdictions the terms eRegistration
and eConveyancing and related concepts are ill-deﬁned and used somewhat inter-
changeably.48 He attributes this to differences in legal systems and sometimes to the
use of language. Thus in outlining the developments in Ireland he proposed the
following working deﬁnitions:
eApplications: this covers ordering documents and services online. . ..eLodgement: relates
to the lodgement of applications resulting in changes to the register (‘registration’). . ..
eRegistration: lodgement of documents occurs in electronic format only (paper documents
are not lodged) and all registrations are made on an electronic register. . ..eConveyancing:
the term envisages paperless transactions through most or all of the stages of the convey-
ancing process from pre-sale to post completion of the transaction.49
These deﬁnitions were presented at the Registering the World Conference50 in
Dublin in 2007 where most, if not all, of the jurisdictions involved in eRegistration

They
have
remained
unchallenged since that time and have become internationally accepted.52 These
deﬁnitions are drawn upon, amended and expanded substantially in order to gen-
erate a neutral vocabulary for this research.
This neutral vocabulary as set out below provides commonality and a consistent
set of terms that can be applied across jurisdictions and systems. It provides an
explication of knowledge and meaning in order to overcome diversity between
jurisdictions. It attempts to provide unambiguously deﬁned concepts for the model-
ing process by setting out the meaning for terms in the model. This vocabulary also
limits the boundaries and sets out the parties to the conveyancing transactions to be
examined.
While the phrase neutral vocabulary is used here, other commentators and
researches have chosen to use different terms. For example Paasch refers to
standardised terminology53 while O’Sullivan refers to working deﬁnitions.54 Visser
and Schlieder use the term ontology to mean a language of shared concepts.55 They
point out that while there are already ontologies available in the law domain these
have been conﬁned to legal reasoning and spatio-temporal ontologies and, in their
view, the inability of these ontologies to describe processes might be one reason
why they have not been used frequently in the development of models of real
property transactions.56 Thus Visser and Schlieder and their colleagues turned to
software engineering to build their model of real estate transactions.
Visser and Bench-Capon point out that few authors have explicitly speciﬁed
their conceptualisation of the legal domains in a (semi-) formal language.57 Having
compared four legal ontologies they also come to the conclusion that none of the
ontologies seem to have adequate provisions to specify legal procedures. They
point out many of the difﬁculties with comparing legal ontologies and suggest the
creation of libraries of legal ontologies, indexed on task, legal subdomain, appli-
cability, and abstraction level.58
Hage and Verheij present an abstract model of the law as ‘a top ontology’.59
Their aim is to ﬁnd heuristic guidelines for legal knowledge representation by a
model based on two crucial characteristics of the law. Firstly, that the law is a

dynamic system of states of affairs and secondly that these states of affairs are
interconnected.60 In this way they take account of events thus reﬂecting the
sequential nature of the legal process.
These commentators are using the term ontology to express language as a method
of organising and structuring information about law and legal systems. They are of
the view that the ontologies already available in the law domain are ﬂawed in that
they do not take account of law as a process or sequence of events and this is why they
have not been used frequently in models of real property transactions.
There is no doubt that many aspects of law are governed by the sequential nature
of legal transactions and this is particularly evident in conveyancing where one step
is often predicated on a prior step in the process.61
In articulating the terms forming the framework for this examination the term
neutral vocabulary was chosen as providing a simple yet accurate reﬂection of the
purpose for its inclusion. A speciﬁc attempt has been made to keep the language
clear and unambiguous so as to open this analysis to those without any detailed
knowledge of the conveyancing or registration process. Though much of the
vocabulary stems from a common law legal perspective and this may confuse a
reader from a civil law background.
This neutral vocabulary is as follows:

eRecords
This is the ﬁrst phase of eConveyancing. It requires the registering authority to
convert all its paper records to an electronic format. This phase is a subset of
eApplication and eRegistration.
eApplication
This is also a subset of eRegistration and is the second stage of a wider
eRegistration and eConveyancing project. It involves electronic messaging or
data transfer from the lawyer to the registering authority but this must subsequently
be followed by the lodgement of paper. This may also be referred to as
eLodgement.62 It is a precursor to eRegistration and may become obsolete when
full eRegistration is introduced. Until then eApplication and eRegistration may
operate in parallel.

eRegistration
eRegistration is the application of technology solely to the registration element of a
conveyancing transaction. This will involve electronic messaging or data transfer
from the lawyer to the registering authority. No paper documents are lodged.63 This
is an essential element of eConveyancing and is usually a precursor to it. It is the
third phase before the ﬁnal development of eConveyancing.
eConveyancing
The application of information technology to the conveyancing process (often
referred to as electronic conveyancing or e-conveyancing). O’Connor says that
electronic conveyancing or EC is not a term of art, but can refer to any part of the
conveyancing process being done through the transmission of digital data.64 It
moves conveyancing from being a paper based system of recording transactions
and documents to an electronic system via the creation of a secure electronic
network and a set of processes underpinned by technology.
The network can take various forms. These include a desktop application
between each stakeholder group, a desktop application for all stakeholder groups,
a stakeholder portal or a central hub. The differences between these options and an
assessment of their respective advantages and disadvantages are set out in the Irish
Law Reform Commission Report on eConveyancing.65 The Commission recom-
mends the central hub model as the most appropriate model for Ireland66 however
not everyone agrees.
Connolly is of the view that this model is unnecessary and too cumbersome for
Ireland.67 Instead she is in favour of a stakeholder portal.68 In another study Killilea
found that generally the Queensland model of eRegistration met the requirements
of a successful service for Ireland.69 He dismissed the Ontario hub model as being
expensive to develop and maintain due to the use of electronic signature technol-
ogy70 however any eConveyancing system will require some form of authentication
usually involving an advanced electronic signature.
eConveyancing is deﬁned in more detail in Chap. 3 which also explores the
relationship between eRecords, eApplication, eRegistration and eConveyancing.

Methodology

Lawyer
Refers to a solicitor in Ireland, a solicitor or barrister in Ontario and a similar
professional in other jurisdictions. These professionals have authority to practice
conveyancing in Ireland and real estate practice in Ontario.
Conveyancing
The passing of an estate or title to land by way of sale to a purchaser or by gift from
one land owner to another land owner. Also the practice of property law by lawyers
who facilitate the purchase and sale or gift of title to land. In Ontario this is more
commonly referred to as real estate practice but the term conveyancing will be used.
This passing of title to land occurs by means of a process or set of procedures that
must be complied with in order for one land owner to dispose legally of their title to
another who thereby becomes the owner of the land. Sale and purchase are used to
describe a single transaction, such usage depending upon context and standpoint.
Conveyancing Transaction
This includes a purchase and sale or gift, of the whole or part of the title to land,
whether freehold or leasehold, and also includes the granting of a lease or the
creation of a charge in favour of a lender. In general usage it may also refer to the
creation of other rights or interests such as easements, restrictive covenants or trusts
in land.
Land Registration
The system under which titles to land are recorded. There are two basic divisions;
deeds registration and title registration. Many commentators use alternative termi-
nology to mark this division. For example Miceli refers to the title registration
system as the Torrens system and the deeds registration system as the recording title
system.71 He, along with many other commentators, marks the division on the basis
of the role of government in guaranteeing land title. The Torrens system is so called
after Sir Robert Torrens, an Irishman, who introduced it ﬁrst in South Australia
in 1858.
O’Connor notes that the term ‘Torrens system’ is an ambiguous one72 as it has
been used in the general sense and also in a genealogical sense. In the general sense
it is used to mean a system that registers land titles and not deeds or instruments. In
71 Miceli et al. (2002), p. 565.

the genealogical sense it refers to the family of land title systems that derive, either
directly or indirectly, from the statutes enacted in Australia at the instigation of Sir
Robert Torrens.73 The two key characteristics that members of this family share are
that indefeasible title74 guaranteed by the state is obtained by registration and the
system includes a system of compensation to ameliorate the risk of an error in the
register erroneously depriving a person of their interest in land.75 However the type
of indefeasible title and also the operation of the compensation system may differ.76
Indefeasible title may only arise in relation to the ﬁrst registration of the title thus
‘cleansing’ it of all prior defects. It may be conferred on each purchaser (immediate
indefeasibility) or, alternatively, if there is a defect in a transaction then that
purchaser’s title may not be indefeasible but a subsequent purchaser’s title may
be (deferred indefeasibility). There are also exceptions which may make the title
defeasible. For example if the title was obtained through fraud77 or there was some
moral wrong-doing resulting in an in personam action.78
Similarly recourse to compensation may be limited in various ways. There may
be criteria that have to be met. For example the party wronged may have to claim
against the wrongdoer ﬁrst so that the compensation fund is only a last recourse. In
other jurisdictions the party may make a claim ab initio. Claimants may need to
show that they did not cause the loss, fraud, neglect or default or the amount of
compensation may be limited.
Indefeasibility and the compensation scheme are examined in Chaps. 4 and 7
with particular reference to Ontario and Ireland.
Deeds Registration (or Unregistered Title)
In Ireland deeds are registered in the Registry of Deeds. The deed (document) is
registered but the title is not, so the title is commonly referred to as unregistered
title.
73 O’Connor (2003), p. 81.
74 Conclusive and unimpeachable. See Ruoff (1952), p. 118.
75 Flaws notes that state compensation may only have been introduced to entice lawyers to accept
the Torrens system and he references law reform proposals in New South Wales as identifying
Malaysia, Sudan, Fiji, West Germany and Austria as jurisdictions where registration systems
operate without compensation. See Flaws (2003), p. 400.
76 These aspects are explored in detail in Chaps. 4 and 7.
77 There is no statutory deﬁnition in Ireland. In Ontario fraudulent instrument and fraudulent
person are deﬁned in section 1 of the Land Titles Act R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER L. 5.
78 A registered owner should not be allowed to refuse to perform contracts he had made and anyone
who entered into such a contract should be entitled to claim such relief in law or in equity as a
Court may grant. This includes speciﬁc performance or enforcement of a trust and may result in the
Court ordering the registered owner to part with his title.

“Systems of deeds registration do not abrogate the principle that a chain of title is
only as strong as its weakest link.”79 Thus under the deeds registration system the
title must be investigated de novo every time the property is transferred.
In Ontario this system is referred to as the Registry system. In both jurisdictions
this is the older system. As part of the move towards eConveyancing both jurisdic-
tions have changed their deeds registration system to make it more similar to the
title registration system so that in time the deeds system can be closed or merged
into the title registration system.80 In this analysis the term deeds registration or
unregistered title denotes unregistered title in Ireland and deeds registered in the
Registry system in Ontario.
Title Registration (or Registered Title)
In Ireland title is registered in the Land Registry. This is commonly referred to as
registered land or title. In Ontario this system is referred to as the land titles system.
In both jurisdictions the title is registered and not the deed as in a deeds register.
In this analysis the term title registration or registered title denotes registered
title in both Ireland and Ontario. Many commentators have maintained that
eConveyancing can only be successful in a title registration system and this has
provided the impetus for both jurisdictions to move away from deeds registration
towards title registration.
Neave sets out the triad of principles that underpin title registration; the ‘mirror
principle’ (the register as a mirror of the state of the title),81 the ‘curtain principle’
(behind which the purchaser need not investigate)82 and the ‘insurance principle’
(the state guarantees the accuracy of the register and compensates any person
suffering loss if there is an inaccuracy).83 Together these concepts form ‘the
principle of indefeasibility’.84
Registering Authority (Registration Authority or Registry)
The authority which manages and controls land registration in each jurisdiction. In
Ireland the Registry of Deeds and Land Registry are managed and controlled by the
Property Registration Authority (PRA). The PRA (or PRAI) operates under the
79 Neave (1976), p. 173.
80 See Donahue et al. (2003), p. 1 in relation to Ontario.
81 The question arises as to whether this means the state of the legal title or should it reﬂect the
truth on the ground.
82 The danger is that the ‘real’ ownership could be hidden behind this curtain.
83 Neave (1976), p. 174. These three fundamental principles are attributed to Ruoff. See Ruoff

auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality. In Ontario the Registry system
and the Land Titles system are governed by the Ministry of Government Services
(Ontario Ministry or Ministry). Both are under the control of central government.
Title Register (Register or Land Register)
The record of registered titles i.e. the title register held and maintained by the
registering authority. The term title register is used as the term land register is close
to land registration which encompasses both the title register and the deeds register.
The term land register may arise in quotations and unless otherwise indicated
this should be read to mean the title register. The term register may also be used and
again this should be read to mean the title register (and not the deeds register).
Deeds Register
The record of documents dealing with unregistered titles i.e. the register of deeds
held and maintained by the registering authority.
Registrar
Generally this is an ofﬁcial in the registering authority who can alter the title
register and who has statutory powers relating to the management and operation
of land registration.
In Ireland this role is known as the Registrar of Titles however since 2006 the
powers are vested in the PRA. Thus the terms Land Registry, registrar and PRA
(or PRAI) in relation to Ireland may be used interchangeably.
In Ontario there are a number of roles; the Director of Titles, the Director of
Land Registration and individual land registrars who cover the 54 land registry
ofﬁces.85 In simple terms the Director of Land Registration authorises access to the
eRegistration system; the Director of Titles determines policy and regulates any
matter relating to title and, while the individual land registrars can change the
register if there is an error, only the Director of Titles can determine matters relating
to fraud. References to the registrar in Ontario will refer to the Director of Titles
unless otherwise stated.

Registration
The process of registration of
(a) title (an estate, right or interest in land);
(b) the deed, transfer or electronic transfer;
(c) encumbrance; and
(d) the deed of encumbrance, court order or other document which gives validity to
the encumbrance.
Registrant
Person who alters the title register by means of an electronically sent message or
data e.g. electronic transfer to the registering authority. This person is not employed
by the registering authority and is usually a lawyer. This role does not arise outside
of eRegistration or eConveyancing. As the person is not employed by the register-
ing authority they are not under the direct management of central government.
Their actions and authority are controlled by the business rules and policies laid
down as part of the system design which is demonstrated via format and form.
Automatic
A change in the title register is automatic if it is triggered immediately by the
registrant without any intervention by staff in the registering authority. It is auto-
matic as no ‘human’ input is required from the registering authority. Arrun˜ada
refers to this as agency registration.86
Automated
A change in the title register may be automated without being automatic.87 The
process occurs via electronic channels but the registrar or staff in the registering
authority need to act upon the message or data before a change in the title register
can take place. Thus it is automated but not automatic. This ‘human’ input by the
registering authority can involve processing of the data or a substantive check.
eRegistration involves the automating of applications to the registering authority.

Chap. 3.
87 The United Nations Economic and Social Council (2007), p. 4 notes that the choice between
automatic or automated access will often be determined by the nature of the registry guarantee or
indemnity.

Applicant
Person, usually a lawyer, who makes an electronic application to the registrar but
who cannot alter the title register. The word applicant is generally used when
referring to the eApplication phase of eConveyancing where there remains lodge-
ment of paper.
Transferor
Is the seller (or vendor) of registered title for value. For value means that the title is
sold for its value in money or an equivalent. This is referred to as the consideration.
In this analysis the term purchase monies is used. ‘A’ is the transferor88 in the
schematic in Chap. 5.
Transferee (or Bona ﬁde Purchaser for Value)
Is the buyer (or purchaser) of registered title for value. This person is also called a
bona ﬁde purchaser for value.89 ‘B’ is the transferee90 in the schematic.
Donor
Is the person giving a gift of registered title not for value. ‘X’ is the donor in the
schematic in Chap. 5.
Donee (or Volunteer)
Is the person receiving the gift of registered title not for value. This person is also
called a volunteer.91 ‘Y’ is the donee in the schematic.
88 Used as a term of art for vendor in Ireland and hence this is used rather than following the more
general England usage of ‘vendor’.

Lender
This is the provider of secured ﬁnance for a conveyancing transaction. The ﬁnance
is secured on the basis of a legal charge on the title to land. Also known as secured
lender, chargee or mortgagee. In Ireland the lender is often treated the same as the
transferee. Section 3 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 200992
(hereafter the 2009 Act) provides that the deﬁnition of purchaser includes a
mortgagee. This contrasts with the position in Ontario where the lender and
transferee may be treated differently.93
The lender’s role in a conveyancing transaction can be split into two speciﬁc
functions. These functions can be carried out by the same provider or by two
different providers. The prior lender will be seeking to have its charge paid in
full from the purchase monies and the acquisition lender will be seeking to have a
ﬁrst legal charge registered against the title on foot of the monies advanced to the
transferee for the conveyancing transaction. The prior lender is ‘T’ in the schematic
and the acquisition lender is ‘C’.
In Ireland standard practice is to have a ﬁrst legal charge for ‘all sums due’ and
any further monies advanced later by the same lender would be secured by that
charge. Where additional monies are advanced by another lender there is the
possibility of a second, or other subsequent charges, on the title and these would
be common in commercial lending. The creation of second charges to release equity
in family homes did occur to some extent during Ireland’s property boom but many
homes are now in negative equity and lending rules have tightened to the extent that
such lending is now rare. Thus the role of such subsequent lenders does not form
part of the schematic.
Where the land owner re-mortgages after the transaction is completed the new
ﬁnance provider will step into the shoes of the acquisition lender and thus is dealt
with as part of ‘C’s role in the schematic.
Chargor (or Mortgagor)
Holder of title to land who grants a legal charge (or mortgage) to a lender. When a
mortgage is created the title is transferred to the lender who covenants to transfer
the title back when the loan is repaid (redeemed). When a charge is created the title
is not transferred to the lender but the charge becomes an encumbrance on the title.
The terms mortgage and charge will be used interchangeably to denote a legal
charge on title to land.

the recovery of compensation from the registrar. These aspects are explored more fully in Chap. 7.

Subsequent Purchaser
Person who subsequently purchases the property from the transferee, B, or the
donee, Y. This is a bona ﬁde purchaser for value94 and does not include a
subsequent lender. The subsequent purchaser is ‘D’ in the schematic.
Contract
The legally binding agreement between the transferor and transferee setting out the
terms and conditions of the conveyancing transaction. This will be for value;
generally no contract is completed in the case of a gift.
Deed
The formal document which passes title from a transferor to a transferee or from a
donor to a donee. This is handed over at completion of the transaction and it gives
effect to the contract. A deed of conveyance is the document which passes
unregistered freehold title and a deed of assignment is the document which passes
unregistered leasehold title. For registered title the deed is called a transfer.
Transfer (or Deed of Transfer)
The document which passes registered title (freehold and leasehold) from a trans-
feror to a transferee or from a donor to a donee. This is handed over at completion of
the transaction. It gives effect to the contract.
Electronic Transfer
The electronic form, message or series thereof which passes registered title from a
transferor to a transferee or from a donor to a donee. This will be transmitted to the
registering authority at or immediately after completion of the transaction. It gives
effect to the contract.
Assurance

Methodology

Completion (or Closing)
The legal and procedural requirements for ﬁnalising the conveyancing transaction.
Moore and Globe refer to this as closing the deal96 and in some jurisdictions it is
referred to as settlement. The deed or transfer and vacant possession is exchanged
for the purchase monies. In eConveyancing the electronic transfer is transmitted to
the registering authority and there is electronic funds transfer (EFT) of the purchase
monies. Thus completion may involve payment, transfer and registration of title.
Generally physical possession or the right to physical possession of the property
passes at the point of completion.
It is difﬁcult to tie down a speciﬁc point of completion. This is due to the
sequential nature of the conveyancing transaction and the fact that completion
may involve a number of speciﬁc steps. In a paper environment the paper docu-
ments and keys may be exchanged physically for a cheque or bank draft. This
exchange will then be referred to as the closing or completion of the deal. In an
electronic environment there may be no exact point of exchange. Instead comple-
tion may occur at the push of a computer key.
From a transferor’s perspective, completion is likely to be when the balance of
the purchase monies is released to him or her. A transferee will likely say that
completion occurs when they get the keys and thus possession. From a legal
perspective completion occurs at an earlier point.
In Ireland the paper deed or transfer and any other closing documents, together
with the keys, are exchanged for the purchase monies. This may occur in person or
by post. After completion the transferee’s lawyer will pay the stamp duty and then
lodge the deed or transfer for registration. Thus completion occurs prior to
registration.
In Ontario documents are signed electronically by the lawyers pursuant to a
signed Acknowledgement and Direction97 from the client.98 The transaction is then
closed and documents are registered in accordance with a Document Registration
Agreement (DRA)99 between the lawyers. A separate Acknowledgement and
Direction and DRA will be required for each registration in the e-reg system100
96 Moore and Globe (2003), p. 339.
97 This must be retained in the lawyer’s ﬁle as written veriﬁcation of the clients’ instructions and
authority for electronic document registration. See The Law Society of Upper Canada (2002).
98 The Acknowledgement and Direction conﬁrms the client’s approval of the electronic document
and authorises the lawyer to sign and register electronically. It also authorises the lawyer to enter
into a DRA and close in escrow on behalf of the client. See Moore and Globe (2003), pp. 418–419
for an example of an Acknowledgement and Direction. See also https://www.teranetexpress.ca/

i.e. a transfer, discharge of a charge or creation of a new charge. Electronic trans-
actions are closed online in escrow.
As in traditional escrow closings the funds, keys and documents are held in trust
until each lawyer has conﬁrmed receipt and approval of their respective require-
ments. The transferree’s lawyer will usually register the transfer and other docu-
ments according to the list set out in Schedule A of the DRA. This lists the
documents being registered and also the order or priority in which they are to be
registered. The sequence is usually as follows101:
1. the transferor’s lawyer delivers the closing documents that are not to be regis-
tered to the transferee’s lawyer
2. the transferee’s lawyer delivers the closing documents that are not to be regis-
tered to the transferor’s lawyer together with a certiﬁed cheque for the closing
proceeds
3. all these non registration documents and the purchase monies are held in escrow
4. once each lawyer is satisﬁed with the closing deliveries due to them, the trans-
feror’s lawyer logs on to the Teraview system102 and authorises the release of the
registration documents
5. the transferee’s lawyer then logs onto the system and completes a ﬁnal search to
conﬁrm that there has been no change to the title
6. once this is conﬁrmed the transferee’s lawyer instructs the system to proceed
with registration
7. the system automatically searches for executions103 before registration is
completed
8. once registration is completed the transferee’s solicitor contacts the transferor’s
solicitor to conﬁrm the registration and then all documents and monies are
released from the escrow.
This is the sequence where the DRA provides for the release from escrow to
occur following notice that registration has been completed. The DRA also allows
for this release to occur at a closing time referred to in the agreement of purchase
and sale.
A registration conﬁrmation report which lists the documents and their registra-
tion numbers will be printed immediately following closing. In addition the parcel
register104 may be printed in order to conﬁrm registration. Fees are transferred in
the Teraview account for payment of registry fees and taxes. The ﬁnal closing
searches are also done online.

Methodology

The standard form provides for two alternative completion options, completion
to occur after registration or at an earlier closing time, but Donahue and his
colleagues note that despite the risks:
current practice is to complete purchases and mortgage advances just as one would do
under the [unregistered] Registry system and not await the certiﬁcation of the
instrument.105
Thus in both Ireland and generally in Ontario closing occurs in advance of
registration. Funds and non-registration documents are exchanged in advance of
electronic registration in Ontario. In Ireland funds and all documents are exchanged
in advance of paper registration.
The issue of completion is explored further in Chap. 6 as the time gap between
completion and registration is one of the key risks examined.
Land Owner
Generic term to include transferor, transferee, donor and donee i.e. ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘X’ and
‘Y’ in the schematic in Chap. 5.
Encumbrance
Encumbrance is a burden or restriction on the title to land and includes charges held
by a lender, rights or interests held by third parties and judgments against the title.
Property Claimant
Someone claiming or asserting a new right or interest in the land. The potential time
available for claiming or asserting such a right or interest is usually limited. ‘V’ is
the property claimant in the schematic.
Examples might include a non owning spouse who has the right to challenge a
transaction that took place without their consent, someone claiming a right of
pre-emption on foot of a contract or option to purchase, a claim of proprietary
estoppel or part performance or someone who contributed to the purchase price and
is thus claiming the existence of a trust.
The claim may be unsuccessful or may succeed but be deemed not to create a
new right or interest in the land. In these instances the property claim fails. The
successful property claimant will become a third party or encumbrancer.

Third Party (or Encumbrancer)
Someone other than the land owner or lender who wishes to protect their existing
right or interest in land. A successful property claimant becomes a third party or
encumbrancer. This third party has a proprietary interest in the land. For example
someone holding an easement or an equitable interest. Such third party rights do not
fall within the registrable estates but instead may appear as burdens upon registered
titles. The third party is ‘U’ in the schematic.
Pre Contract
The initial negotiation and enquiries carried out in a conveyancing transaction prior
to execution of the contract.106 For example there may be some negotiation about
the exact purchase monies and completion date. The enquiries may relate to the size
and physical condition or location of the property, planning, occupation, outgoings
and services.107
Post Contract
The stage of the conveyancing transaction after execution of the contract and before
completion. During this stage the transferor and transferee are legally bound to
complete the transaction and cannot back out save as provided for by the terms of
the contract.
The exact point at which the contract becomes binding will differ according to
the jurisdiction and the terms of the contract. It may be when the contract is signed
by both parties (executed) or when it is signed and delivered (or exchanged) or it
may not be binding until a deposit is paid.
Alternatively the contract may be executed subject to some conditions and will
only become binding when these conditions are met. In both Ontario and Ireland the
contract will usually be subject to such conditions. This contract is in a standard
form. In Ireland it is a precedent document issued by the Law Society.108 In Ontario
it is usually in a printed form prepared by a legal stationer or by the local real estate
board.109
106 In Ireland the contract is referred to as the contract or conditions of sale. In Ontario it is called
an agreement of purchase and sale.

Post Completion
The legal and procedural formalities to be done after completion. These will often
include payment and discharge of the prior charge and registration of the trans-
feree’s title and the new charge. It will also include practical matters such as the
transferee taking occupation of the property and notifying service providers of the
new ownership.
Title to Land
“Both ‘who can be an owner’ and ‘what can be owned’ are deﬁned by law. . ..
Ownership can only exist if it is acknowledged and properly enforced within a
society.”110 In legal terms what is owned is not the land or property, the physical
entity, but an estate or interest in that entity which denotes the nature and extent of
land ownership.111 The student of property law expects to study physical objects
but instead encounters abstractions.112 Often this is referred to as having title
to land.
Title to land can be divided into two fundamental groups; estates and interests.
Interests are more minor and fall short of estates which confer major rights in
respect of the land. In simple terms an estate gives the right to possession or
occupation to the exclusion of others while an interests confers a limited right to
land owned by another.
The notion of dividing ownership according to different periods of time is what makes land
ownership under a common law system ﬂexible. It enshrines the fundamental principle that
what is owned is not the physical entity, the land, but rather some estate (giving substantial
rights in respect of the land such as the right to occupy it) or interest (giving less substantial
rights such as the limited use given by an easement comprising, for example, a right of way
over a road on the land, or a proﬁt a` prendre comprising a right to cut and take away turf) in
the land. . ..How many of the various estates and interests will exist in respect of a particular
parcel of land will vary from case to case.113
Different people may own different estates and interests at the same time or in
succession in respect of the same land. Engle notes that the “concept of absolute
exclusivity and precisely deﬁned right is completely alien to contemporary legal
thought, which sees [property] rights as relative, divisible, and somewhat
amorphous.”114

For Calabresi and Melamed the law decides entitlement, so as to determine who
will prevail among two conﬂicting parties, and having made that initial choice must
then enforce it through state intervention.115 In relation to conﬂicting property
rights this will be reﬂected in how a property registration system operates.
Not every estate or interest can avail of the protection offered by registration in
the registering authority. Those capable of registration in the title register are seen
as being more advantageous than those capable of registration in the deeds register
as the title register is backed by a state guarantee. Chapter 4 examines in detail the
estates and interests that can be registered in Ontario and Ireland.
In general property law seeks to classify property rather than to deﬁne it. The
classiﬁcations govern the way property interests are protected in law by registration
and the way they are transmitted which is procedural. Lawson and Rudden note that
property law deﬁnes types of user as ‘property’ which will be protected against third
parties and is alienable and is divided into those which bind regardless of notice
(overriding interests)116 and those that depend on notice (registration).117
The four dimensions that determine how property is classiﬁed are length, height,
breadth and time. In seeking ways to make sense of this classiﬁcation commentators
have used varying methods of explaining the nature of ownership. Lawson and
Rudden provide some examples based on the principle of the fragmentation of
ownership.118 Birks uses ﬁve keys: time, space, reality, duality and formality.119
These principles and the concept of estates and interests ﬂowing from them
recognise the ﬂexible division of ownership including the division between legal
and equitable ownership. In addition the inchoate nature of the common law
equitable system often allows for the growth of categories of estates and interests
which are not limited and may be expanded to meet the needs and demands of the
market place.
This is in stark contrast to the numerus clausus doctrine which applies in civil
law countries.
The numerus clausus – principle states that nature and content of the German real rights are
regulated by law. . ..in legal dealings rights have to be selected from a self-contained pool of
real rights. This might appear to you. . .as being restrictive. . ..However, it is a fact that
German 19th century lawmakers were ruled by a desire for legal certainty, clarity, and
uniformity.120
As Lawson and Rudden point out:
[i]f property law had been codiﬁed after the Continental fashion, the codiﬁers would have
introduced more order into it, and in particular would have asked whether certain gener-
alizations accepted for one kind of property were acceptable for others.121

Instead they note a lack of co-ordination in English property law and the
different ways of dealing with property in that it may be enjoyed as a physical
object or as an investment “of which the money value alone is relevant. . ..[This
distinction] may be expressed summarily as one between objects and wealth, or
between use-value and exchange-value.”122 The differing values which can be
imposed on property ownership is a recurring theme throughout this analysis.
The push towards eConveyancing has given impetus to the drive for similar legal
certainty, clarity and uniformity in common law jurisdictions and there is a possi-
bility that a move towards numerus clausus will become the norm. It is more
difﬁcult to build an electronic system that is ﬂexible enough to accommodate
estates and interests that may not be determined for some years to come. This
aspect of eConveyancing is explored in Chap. 8.123
Estates
In both Ontario and Ireland ownership of land is deﬁned according to common law
principles which are less absolute and more ﬂexible than the civil law system in
continental Europe referred to earlier.
Land is ‘held’ (not ‘owned’ in the civil law sense) and the tenant is entitled to an ‘estate’.
Various types of estates can be distinguished, but an essential characteristic of each estate is
time. The two major types are the freehold (unlimited duration) and the leasehold (limited
duration).124
Many jurisdictions, including Ontario and Ireland, limit the number of legal
estates to these two. The ﬁrst being a freehold (also know as the fee simple) and the
second being a leasehold which is a limited estate in that it only exists for a term of
years. It may be said that each estate is conferred with powers, rights, privileges and
liberties.125 Each estate confers rights together with obligations on the land owner
and property law often attempts to balance these in the one estate and also between
different land owners.
In Ontario the Crown has the ultimate or underlying title however this has been
described as a legal ﬁction.126 Rights are held from the crown in the form of tenures,
estates and interests. When Ontario was settled all land in the province was claimed
by the Crown and the only way settlers could get title was to obtain a Crown
Patent.127 Donahue notes that only by examining the Crown Patent can you

ascertain what interests are retained by the Crown and this information does not
appear in the registry except for patents issued since 1 October 1965.128
In Ireland the 2009 Act129 abolished feudal tenure130 and the old feudal notion
that all land was held ultimately from the Crown. The explanatory memorandum
states that this concept is not compatible with the relationship between the State and
its citizens as prescribed by the Constitution.131 However the position of the State as
ultimate intestate successor to a deceased person’s property under section 73 of the
Succession Act 1965 was preserved.132 The word tenure continues to be used to
denote the terms and conditions under which someone holds land while the doctrine
of estates is used to denote the duration or time for which the land is held.133
The 2009 Act preserved the notion of estates and interests in land,134 both
freehold and leasehold. The only legal estates that may be created or disposed of
are the freehold and leasehold estates speciﬁed by section 11. Section 11(4) set out
the legal interests in land that could be created or disposed of. Whether they are
legal or equitable will depend on how the interest was created. Failure to comply
with the necessary formalities may lead to an equitable interest only being
created.135
Section 11(2) provides that a freehold estate means a fee simple in possession
and includes
(a) a determinable fee,136
(b) a fee simple subject to a right of entry or of re-entry,137
(c) a fee simple subject only to
(i) a power of revocation,
(ii) an annuity or other payment of capital or income for the advancement,
maintenance or other beneﬁt of any person, or
(iii) a right of residence which is not an exclusive right over the whole land.
128 See Donahue et al. (2003), p. 2. If the patent issued prior to 1 October 1965 a search must be
made in the Ministry of Natural Resources and if the lands were reserved as Indian lands then
searches must be made elsewhere.

to facilitate the introduction of an eConveyancing system as soon as possible.

136 This is a qualiﬁed fee simple. It is subject to the possibility that it may end prematurely.
137 The fee simple may be subject to the right of some other person to entry or re-entry. The right of
entry will be to take possession temporarily whereas the right of re-entry will be to take
permanently. In the case of re-entry the previous owner’s estate or interest will be forfeit.

Methodology

Section 11(3) provides that a leasehold estate means the estate which arises
when a tenancy is created for any period of time or any recurring period and
irrespective of whether or not the estate
(a) takes effect in immediate possession or in future, or
(b) is subject to another legal estate or interest, or
(c) is for a term which is uncertain or liable to termination by notice, re-entry or
operation of law or by virtue of a provision for cessor on redemption or for any
other reason.
Such a tenancy creates the relationship of landlord and tenant which is based on
the parties’ contract or agreement and not on tenure.138 A tenancy may be for a
ﬁxed period of time or for any recurring period. These recurring tenancies are
known as periodic tenancies and may be weekly, monthly or yearly. They will run
for such successive periods until either party serves notice terminating the tenancy.
Interests (or Rights in Land)
Section 11(4) sets out the legal interests in land which may be created or disposed
of. These are more minor and fall short of estates which confer major rights in
respect of the land. An estate gives the right to possession or occupation to the
exclusion of others while an interests confers a limited right to land owned by
another. Legal interests are limited to the following;
(a) an easement,139
(b) a freehold covenant,140
(c) an incumbrance,141
(d) a rent payable under a tenancy,142
(e) a possibility of reverter,143
(f) a proﬁt a` prendre, including a mining right,144
(g) a public or customary right,145
(h) a rentcharge,146
138 See section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland 1860 (known as
Deasy’s Act).
139 These include a right to light, right of way or a right of support.
140 Such a covenant may require a fence to be erected or may restrict usage.
141 Under section 3 this includes annuities, liens and other charges over land which may be created
in favour of others. Examples include the payment of a capital sum or funds to provide an income
or the creation of a mortgage or judgment mortgage.
142 This is an interest that can be assigned.
143 Again this is an interest that can be assigned.
144 The holder has the right to go onto someone else’s land and take something natural from
it. Examples are the right to cut turf (turbary) and graze animals (pasture).
145 Examples include a public right of way or the right to use parkland.
146 The rent is a charge on the land and arises separate to the relationship of landlord and tenant.

(i) a right of entry or of re-entry attached to a legal estate,147
(j) a wayleave or other right to lay cables, pipes, wires or other conduits,148
(k) any other legal interest created by any statutory provision.149
Thus further legal interests can be created by statute. Other estates and interests
take effect as equitable interests only but this does not prevent the creation of the
above estates and interests as equitable interests.150 Also nothing in the 2009 Act
affects judicial recognition of equitable interests.151 Thus the courts remain free to
exercise their equitable jurisdiction to develop the law in order to accommodate the
changing needs of Irish society. Recent examples include the
equitable doctrines of proprietary estoppel and constructive and resulting trusts, whereby a
person who is the strict legal owner of land may be regarded as holding it subject to some
equitable interest of another person.152
As previously noted Canada has retained the feudal principle that all land is held
or owned by the Crown. “Where no original Crown patent was issued for a piece of
land, no private ownership can exist in law, even today.”153 Subject, however, to
that underlying Crown ownership, individual owners hold estates. Again the two
basic categories are freehold and leasehold. The freehold can be a fee simple and
though less common a conditional fee simple, a determinable fee simple or a life
estate. The leasehold estate can be ﬁxed or periodic. These are the only legal estates
that can exist.
The distinction between legal and equitable interests is important. The general
rule is that legal interests will bind successors in title whereas a mere equitable
interest may lose priority to subsequent purchasers of a legal estate. Thus legal
interests confer a greater degree of protection on the holder. While additional legal
interests can be created by legislation and equitable interests can be created by the
courts, only two legal estates exist; the freehold and leasehold.
These interests or rights with reference to Ireland and Ontario include:
•
easements
•
rights of non owning spouses, civil partners or cohabitees during the life of the
land owner
•
judgment mortgagor
•
the proprietary interests of anyone in actual occupation
•
someone holding under adverse possession
147 The right to entry or re-entry may arise in relation to a freehold or leasehold estate. The right of
entry will be temporary whereas the right to re-entry will lead to forfeiture of the previous owner’s
estate or interest.
148 Utility companies supplying water, gas and electricity commonly hold these interests.

The distinction between different rights in land can be confusing as many

use these terms when they actually mean estates.159 Also estates that are capable of
being registered in the title register are commonly called registered or registrable
interests. Chapter 5 explores the categorisation of rights in more detail.160

Overriding Interests
Overriding interests are those that affect title without registration in the title
register.
The Ontario government guarantees the registered title vested in a land owner
subject to the liabilities, rights and interests in section 44(1) of the Land Titles Act
R.S.O. 1990161 (hereafter the Land Titles Act) and these are deemed not to be
encumbrances within the meaning of the Act. Section 44(1) contains a list of
13 liabilities, rights and interests to which registered land remains subject. Donahue
et al. note that it is a formidable list.162
Similarly the Irish Land Registry guarantees registered title subject to some
exceptions. Section 72(1) as amended163 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964164
(hereafter the 1964 Act) sets out the class that affects without registration though
notice of any section 72 burden may be entered on the register under section 72
(3).165
The 19 overriding interests in Ireland are listed below and where there is
commonality with the 13 in Ontario this is indicated in brackets and italics.
1. duties and taxes (provincial taxes and succession duties)
2. charges re land improvement and drainage
3. annuities or rentcharges under the Land Purchase Acts

of water, and other easements)

10. tenancies created for any term not exceeding 21 years or for any less estate or
interest, in cases where there is an occupation under such tenancies (short term

ment, subdivision or sub-letting) or 73 (mines, minerals and mining rights)
applies

Those arising in Ontario with no comparable interest in Ireland are:
a. a construction lien (in Ireland a creditor would obtain a judgment mortgage)
b. any right of expropriation, access or user, or any other right, conferred upon or
reserved or vested in the Crown (though this does have a degree of commonality
with 2–5, 15 and 16 above)
c. any liabilities, rights and interests created under section 38 of the Public Trans-
portation and Highway Improvement Act

168 In Ontario this is conﬁned to spouses. In Ireland it is extended to all persons which will also
include spouses. The case of Guckian v. Brennan [1981] I.R. 478 held that the power of a spouse to
refuse consent to a transfer of the family home is not a section 72 burden though such a spouse may
have an overriding interest if in occupation. In the absence of evidence that the assignment had
been invalidated Gannon J. held that the plaintiffs could rely on their registration as full owners
with an absolute title and on the conclusiveness of the register. See also Murray v. Diamond [1982]
I.L.R.M. 113 which afﬁrmed that the right of a spouse to veto a transaction in relation to the family
home is not an overriding interest as section 72 relates to property rights only. The spouse must
hold an estate or interest in the land. In England and Wales the matrimonial home rights of a
spouse cannot be an overriding interest. See section 31(10)(b) of the Family Law Act 1996.
169 Note that in Ontario this is limited to adjoining land.
170 Donahue et al. (2003), p. 28 note that this exception creates a serious ﬂaw in the registered title

Registrable Interests (or Registered Title)
Not every estate or interest is capable of being registered in the title register.
Generally estates are capable of substantive registration but in the case of a lease
this may depend on the length. Other rights may also be capable of registration but
only as burdens on the registered title e.g. a charge. These rights need to be
registered to gain priority.
There are a number of different quality or classes of title. In Ontario section 32
(2) of the Land Titles Act provides that land may be registered with an absolute,
possessory, qualiﬁed or leasehold title. In Ireland the classes are absolute, posses-
sory, qualiﬁed and good leasehold title.171
In Ontario two new types of title were created in order to administratively
convert titles from the unregistered system into the registered system. During this
conversion titles were automatically entered into the title register as part of the
implementation of eRegistration. No application was required by the owner.
Teranet172 converted these titles into qualiﬁed titles called Land Titles Conversion
Qualiﬁed (LTCQ) and such titles can be upgraded to Land Titles Plus (LT Plus). An
LT Plus title “is the best of all titles.”173 If these types of registered title in Ontario
were graded against an absolute title according to the beneﬁts they offered the land
owner they would be listed in the following order:
1. LT Plus
2. LTCQ
3. Absolute title
This is in contrast with most other title registration systems, including Ireland’s,
where the absolute title remains the highest quality title on offer. Lyall says that
absolute title “suggests a title absolutely guaranteed against interests not appearing
on the register, but this is far from the case and the description is in fact quite
misleading. A better description would be “least qualiﬁed title”.”174
Title registration and the types of registered title in Ireland and Ontario is
explored further in Chap. 4.
Purchase Monies
The amount paid by the transferee to the transferor to purchase the title to land.

Methodology

Conclusion
This chapter explored the methodology and deﬁned the neutral vocabulary to
be used in the creation of the abstracted model of the conveyancing process.
Before developing that model the next two chapters explore eConveyancing
and title registration in more detail.

3.1
What Is Conveyancing?
In order to understand eConveyancing it is ﬁrst necessary to ask; what is convey-
ancing? To the layman it is the purchase or sale of property. For example number
15 Royal Road, Ontario. The vendor owns the property and wishes to sell and the
purchaser wishes to buy the property.
As set out in Chap. 2, in legal terms what is owned is not the property but an
estate or an interest in land. Sometimes this is also referred to as title. Thus, to the
lawyer, conveyancing is the process whereby title is passed from one party to
another. In our neutral vocabulary the transferor sells title to the transferee and
the donor gifts title to the donee.
There is no universal conveyancing process. Many jurisdictions do have similar
steps in their conveyancing process though these may not occur in the same order.
Ontario and Ireland, as two common law jurisdictions whose foundations go back to
a common source, the English legal system, have a large degree of commonality in
their conveyancing processes. While the name of the key documentation may differ
the function is often the same. Similarly steps in the process may sometimes be
carried out by different parties or in a different sequence but the main tasks in the
process are the same.
These include:
(a)
obtaining initial mortgage approval from the lender1
(b)
making an offer to purchase2
(c)
doing a home inspection3
1 In Ireland this is known as a loan offer while in Ontario it is referred to as pre-approval.
2 In both jurisdictions this will usually be subject to conditions.
3 In Ireland this is usually done prior to the formal agreement but in Ontario the formal agreement
is usually signed subject to a satisfactory home inspection by a professional home inspector.

(d)

3.2
What Is eConveyancing?
There is a broad spectrum of electronic conveyancing systems. Harpum refers to the
different models of eConveyancing10 and there is no doubt that there are many
variations on the same theme in existence. Sneddon also ‘scopes’ this spectrum.11
Some jurisdictions claim to have eConveyancing but only have an electronic
4 Examples include searching of records held by the registering authority, planning and environ-
mental bodies and court records. Additional queries may also be raised with the transferor about
private information which is not available in a public register. An example would be information
about any tax liability which might impact on the sale. See Appendix 6 of Moore and Globe (2003)
for examples of searches to be done in Ontario. See also Donahue et al. (2003), pp. 312–315 for an
explanation of how to do electronic searching in the Teraview system.
5 In Ireland this is by way of a Contract for Sale. In Ontario it is by way of an Offer to Purchase.
Both are standard documents which contain the key terms and conditions of the transaction such as
payment of deposit, amount of purchase monies, particulars of the property, date of completion
and details of any issues that need to be addressed as part of the transaction.
6 This generally occurs before execution of the contract. It involves formal conﬁrmation based on
the speciﬁc transaction in question.
7 In Ireland this is called an Apportionment Account. In Ontario it is a Statement of Adjustments.

registration system or an electronic lodgement system. One example is the Auto-
mated Registration of Title to Land (ARTL) system in Scotland.
eConveyancing moves the conveyancing process from being a paper-based
process to an electronic process via the creation of electronic communications
networks. This includes not just the system of recording transactions in the regis-
tering authority but also all the other steps in the conveyancing process. The Law
Society of Ireland has described it as a secure, paperless, electronic, end to end,
pre-sale to post-completion, conveyancing process.12
As Sneddon has demonstrated eConveyancing does not have a precise meaning
but encompasses a range of activities in the process of recording, searching and
transferring interests in land which may be effected using electronic (or digital)
communications and/or electronic (or digital) processing.13 For the purposes of this
research the term means the integration of technology into most or all of the
conveyancing process from pre-sale to post completion of the transaction.14 This
includes the contract stage, electronic transfer, completion and title registration.
The term eConveyancing is used though other terms may be used in quotations
from commentators and other researchers.
Thus eConveyancing can be broadly deﬁned as the placing of all conveyancing
systems and processes on a secure electronic platform usually available through an
online portal or hub. This platform, portal or hub is the creation of an electronic
communication network which facilitates system to system exchange of data. In
essence it allows one computer to “speak” to another. Information only has to be
typed in once for each user to have access to it. The security of the platform is
important due to the sensitive and conﬁdential nature of the information being
transmitted and different groups of users may have different levels of access. The
England and Wales Law Society has recognised that there are consequences to the
development of electronic initiatives. These include “the dangers of electronic
attack and threats to the conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of electronic
services and personal data. . .electronic privacy, online security and access to online
services.”15
Libbis explains the move towards eConveyancing as follows:
From the early 1980s jurisdictions have been converting their manual title records to
electronic systems. Late in the 1980s some jurisdictions introduced remote electronic
searches of their electronic title records. From the early 1990s there were proposals for a
fully electronic process to prepare and lodge instruments affecting title records. Through
the 1990s, deregulation of ﬁnancial markets and increasing competition in the mortgage
industry together with development of the internet, electronic payment systems and
12 Law Society of Ireland (2008a), p. 1. This is similar to the broad scope of the eConveyancing
project initially proposed in England and Wales. Harpum offers a brief practical guide showing
how domestic conveyancing might work in this context while Butt provides additional detail for a
typical transaction in that jurisdiction. See Harpum (2000), pp. 5–7 and Butt (2006), pp. 7–22.

electronic commerce generally led to interest in a more convenient and efﬁcient way of
completing property conveyances. With the new century, it was only a matter of when
electronic conveyancing would be come (sic) a reality and how it would be achieved.16
Many jurisdictions began the move towards eConveyancing without even
realising it when paper registers were computerised and converted to electronic
format. Making that information available electronically to users was the next
inevitable step. Sometimes this involved scanning material into an electronic
database17 and in other jurisdictions they converted the information into data sets
that could be manipulated electronically. An electronically scanned version of a
document can be accessed and viewed but it cannot be digitally manipulated and
thus this is not truly eRegistration or eConveyancing.18 A full eConveyancing
system requires documents to be capable of being created, manipulated, transmitted
and signed electronically.
Thus there are a number of change processes required before eConveyancing is
feasible. The ﬁrst is the conversion of all data into an electronic format to be held in
central databases. This includes not just all information on the register but all
contractual forms. The second process is the linking of the stakeholders via an
online portal or hub. This second process requires co-ordination by multiple
stakeholders in order to link the individual databases or systems into an electronic
communication network.
Within the overall eConveyancing theme there are different levels of sophisti-
cation. These range from making title registration information available online to
facilitating differing levels of interaction between stakeholders to a full convey-
ancing transaction done electronically. The increasing integration of information
technology (IT) into the conveyancing process, leading towards eConveyancing,
generally follows this sequence:
1. Conversion of paper records held by the registering authority to an electronic
format. These paper records are converted to electronic data sets that are capable
of being manipulated.
2. Electronic access to data held by the registering authority.
3. Electronic access to data held by the registering authority and authorised users
permitted to lodge electronic applications. Initially these will be followed by the
paper documents.
4. Electronic access to data held by the registering authority and authorised users
permitted to lodge electronic applications with no requirement to lodge the paper
documents.
5. Electronic access to data held by the registering authority, authorised users
permitted to make electronic applications and manipulation of the data sets by
16 Libbis (2007), p. 3. Libbis doesn’t speciﬁcally identify what will be more convenient and
efﬁcient about eConveyancing.
17 This model is used in Queensland. See Killilea (2010).
18 See Killilea (2010) for an alternate view. Killilea has no difﬁculty labelling the Queensland
method of scanning paper documents as an eRegistration system.

authorised users leading to a change in the register. The information provided
electronically by the authorised user will automatically ﬁll in i.e. pre populate
the register. In this sense the process is automated. This manipulation may or
may not require sign off by staff in the registering authority. If it does not require
conﬁrmation by staff in the registering authority the changes are automatic.
6. Other stakeholders in the conveyancing process begin multiple electronic inter-
action through the online portal or hub.
7. The entire end to end conveyancing process is completed electronically. This
includes not just the initial stages of drafting and execution of the contract but
also the ﬁnal stages of completion of the transaction and registration.
Phase 1 above can be labeled eRecords. Phases 2 and 3 come under the heading
of eLodgement or eApplication. Phases 4 and 5 are part of the development of
eRegistration and phases 6 and 7 come into the realm of eConveyancing. Thus there
are four distinct phases in the development of eConveyancing; eRecords,
eApplication, eRegistration and eConveyancing itself. These are explained in
further detail later in this chapter.
Some of the key changes that occur during these phases which lead to
eConveyancing are;
(a) standardisation of documentation19
(b) standardisation of process
(c) increased access to data online
(d) dematerialisation20
(e) extension of title registration
(f) digital signatures
(g) standard format of data21
(h) EFT
19 Common registration documents have been introduced in Ontario for both registered and
unregistered titles. See Donahue et al. (2003), p. 1. The standard transfer deed has been reduced
to three pages and the standard charge to two pages. This is in line with other advances whereby
the contract between the transferor and transferee has been reduced to four pages.
20 Dematerialisation is the process of replacing paper with an electronic process or no process at
all. Many jurisdictions have removed the need for paper certiﬁcates of title which mirrored the
ownership record details recorded in the registry. This paper was required to be produced on each
sale of the land and thus would prove to be an impediment to an electronic system. Examples
include Ontario which did this in 1979 (section 32, The Land Titles Amendment Act, 1979,
S.O. 1979, c. 93), New Zealand which did this in 2002 (section 18, Land Transfer (Computer
Registers and Electronic Lodgement) Amendment Act 2002) and Ireland which did this in 2006
(section 73, Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006). Harpum (2000), p. 3 notes that the
“mechanisms by which property is transferred are undergoing a revolution, namely, the move
from paper-based to dematerialised dealings.” Treacy (2007), p. 29 sees the removal of paper
certiﬁcates as “a far-reaching and necessary milestone on the road towards implementation of a
full e-conveyancing system in Ireland.”
21 Common data standards are particularly important for eConveyancing projects that straddle
jurisdictions. For example the NECS (now PEXA) system in Australia will involve eight juris-
dictions. See Libbis (2007), p. 8.

(i) electronic instruments22
Dematerialisation involves the transformation of the information or data to
electronic information stored on a computer which is capable of being electroni-
cally manipulated.23 It means a move from paper based processes to information
based processes.24 Information migrates from the physical world to the electronic
world heralding the arrival of the paperless ofﬁce.25

the conveyancing process. Once this standardisation is completed the paper docu-
ments can then be dropped in favour of an electronic version that is completed,
executed and transmitted by computers in a secure electronic system. This
dematerialisation of paper documents into data sets that are capable of electronic
manipulation is a core tenet of eConveyancing.
Many of these changes require legislative reform which will enable, authorise
and structure the key developments above.
3.2.1
What Is Not Included?
There is no doubt that an eConveyancing system can facilitate the electronic
transformation of the conveyancing process however there are certain elements of
the process that cannot, or it could be argued, should not, be made electronic. It may
also exclude other parts of the conveyancing process that cannot be replicated by an
electronic application. Examples may include the veriﬁcation of the client’s iden-
tity26 in order to meet the requirements of anti-money laundering legislation and the
client’s authorisation for the transaction.
The formalities of a conveyancing transaction can be made electronic but any
physical act that is intrinsic or substantive must be either dropped or kept in an
eConveyancing environment.
The most obvious of these is the role of a physical inspection of the property.
Land is a physical entity but title to it cannot be dug up and handed over in person
22 See Christensen et al. (2003).
23 No jurisdiction has yet succeeded in making the process entirely paperless. In many instances
the client’s authority must still be given by a wet signature on a paper document. In Ontario the
client must sign an Acknowledgement and Direction authorising the lawyer to enter into a DRA
and to electronically sign and register the documents.
24 Kelly (2010).
25 Widdison (1997), p. 144. Note however that on occasion the electronic world may instead add to
the paper environment. In the Irish eStamping system Revenue replaced a physical stamp on the
deed with an electronic return but lawyers must now print that return for their ﬁle.
26 Though in England solicitors often do this via electronic identity veriﬁcation providers.

on a sale. It is not like a car, table or phone. The transferee must ensure that the
property actually exists, where it’s located and check who is in occupation, the
physical condition and if there are any obvious factors which would impact on the
purchase such as a right of way. These enquiries could or should not be done
remotely.
In Ontario some of the enquiries that would take place during a physical
inspection have been replaced by title insurance.27 Moore and Globe note that
title insurance in Ontario has been held out and accepted as a potentially less
expensive alternative to a boundary survey.28 However there is a danger in this.
Title insurance will only offer compensation. It will not return the property to
someone who has lost it. The shift from ‘buyer beware’ to ‘buyer insure’ has
socialised the risk presumably on the grounds that it is cheaper to take the risk
and buy title insurance on the assumption that in most instances no claim will need
to be made. Thus there is a risk shift from the buyer to the insurance company. The
impact of title insurance is explored further in Chap. 9.29
In America and Canada lenders use electronic valuation systems to check the
level of risk in relation to the amount of funds being advanced on the purchase.
These are called automated valuation mechanisms (AVMs). Lenders use these to
determine an approximation of fair market value for the property as part of the loan
underwriting process. In other jurisdictions lenders retain valuers to inspect the
property and to provide a valuation. This replacement of a personal inspection and
valuation with electronic valuation systems has drawn some comment and blame
for the sub-prime crises in America and the global ﬁnancial crisis.30 While lenders
in other jurisdictions also use electronic valuation systems they use them as an
additional check on the value of the property. It appears that lenders in some
jurisdictions do not want to bear the expense of a physical check as they are not
concerned with the land as such but only want to know the value and if the borrower
is willing and able to pay.
The question of mortgage fraud is also relevant in this context as bogus valua-
tions of property are more easily maintained when dealing with a computer.
Fraudsters can sell the property between themselves at artiﬁcially inﬂated prices
which will fool a computer and thus lull a lender into advancing more money than
the property is actually worth.31
Making all physical acts electronic may thus lead to increased risk and a
potential loss on the part of a lender or transferee. Sneddon having carried out a
detailed risk assessment over 5 months of the proposed Australian system expressed
27 A contract for insuring and indemnifying against loss or damage. In conveyancing transactions it
may compensate the land owner if a title defect arises.

30 See O’Connor (2009), pp. 133–159 for an examination of the lowering of lending standards
including the omission of physical inspection of the property at p. 139.

the view that eConveyancing systems “may have more concentrated points of
failure than paper based systems, for the same reasons that they generate greater
efﬁciencies.”32 These risks and the necessity and desire of the transferee to have
some physical acts remain as part of the process mitigates the ultimate reach of an
eConveyancing system.
3.2.2
Phases of eConveyancing
As noted already four distinct phases can be identiﬁed within the overall develop-
ment of eConveyancing. Each phase is a precursor to the development of the next
more sophisticated phase.
The ﬁrst is the most basic. This requires the registering authority to convert all its
paper records to an electronic format. These paper records are converted to elec-
tronic data sets that are capable of being manipulated on a computer. This phase can
be called ‘eRecords’ as it involves the creation of electronic records. This phase
becomes subsumed into the second phase and is a subset of eApplication and
eRegistration.
The focus of the second phase of eConveyancing, called ‘eApplication’, has the
objective of allowing the lawyer to lodge an application electronically with the
Land Registry.
The information in the electronic application is pre-populated into the register
but the transaction will only proceed once the paper documents have been received
and approved by staff in the registering authority. Pre-populated means that the data
entry is ﬁlled in (typed) on the register in ‘draft’ form as the electronic application is
completed and this draft is then veriﬁed when the paper application is received. The
staff in the registering authority do not need to type the information again but only
need to amend the data if there is any error.
Pre-population can also occur in another way in that the electronic system can
pull information already on the title register into the creation of the electronic
document.33 This avoids the need for entering information already contained in the
register and may be the reason why many commentators believe that an electronic
system will lead to less errors.34 This, however, will only be the case if the
information already in the register is correct. If the error is already on the register,

33 In Ontario title information already stored in the POLARIS (Province of Ontario Land Regis-
tration Information System) database will automatically be brought forward and entered into the
electronic document. See Moore and Globe (2003), p. 425.
34 Moore and Globe (2003), p. 267 state that all necessary Family Law Act statements are
preprogrammed into the electronic document and this reduces clerical errors while simplifying
document drafting.

staff in the registering authority may approve the new application based on that
incorrect information. If the register is deﬁnitive then the information on it will be
deemed to be correct.
In eApplication the process is automated but not automatic as input is required
from staff in the registering authority before the information can affect the register.
In one sense this phase could not really be called part of an eConveyancing system
since it is dependent on the paper documents being lodged before the information
can be acted upon.
Thus this phase retains the ultimate authenticative status of the paper documents.
The electronic lodgment is a provisional stage contingent for its effects upon the
lodgment of the effective papers. The application only has provisional status until
the paper documents are lodged and these are required before the registering
authority staff can amend the register. A fundamental tenet of a complete
eConveyancing system is the replacement of paper with electronic information
however in eApplication the transaction only gains priority upon receipt of the
paper documents.
Where no input from staff in the registering authority is required before a change
is effected in the title register the system may be labelled automatic. The
eConveyancing process is automated because it occurs immediately via electronic
channels but it may also be automatic if no ‘human’ input is required from the
registering authority. Arrun˜ada calls this agency registration where conveyancers
alter the register after automatic controls by an “electronic registrar” but without
manual intervention by the registry staff and notes that this has generally been
rejected or only applied to simple transactions.35
The ARTL36 system in Scotland is an automatic registration system37 as no input
from staff in the registering authority is required to effect a change in registration on
the basis of the electronic application. England and Wales also proposed to adopt
automatic registration.38
The New Zealand e-dealing system is also automatic.39 The lawyer for the
transferee submits the dealing online for registration and provided it passes the
necessary business rules the transaction is registered. These business rules are built
into the system as compliance checks. There is no manual intervention by registry
staff before registration.40
35 Arrun˜ada (2010), p. 115.
36 ARTL stands for Automated Registration of Title to Land but the system is both automated and
automatic.
37 Traynor (2008).
38 The proposal was to allow solicitors and licensed conveyancers to make alterations to the
register by registering dispositions at the same time as they are made. See Law Commission and
HM Land Registry (2001), p. 287. The report states that this is the only practicable way to have
simultaneous disposition and registration. See also Butt (2006), p. 10.
39 See Muir (2003) for an explanation of how this system operates.
40 Greenwood and Jones (2003), pp. 325 and 330.
3.2
What Is eConveyancing?

Arrun˜ada states that this provides the paradigm of agency registration.41 He
warns of associated dangers and the implications of the transfer of risk, costs and
liability between registries and conveyancers.42 Though presumably it is the regis-
try who set the business rules and built them into the system. The transaction is
rejected if it does not meet the requirements of those rules.
It appears that Arrun˜ada is not convinced that such rules can entirely replace
intervention by the registry staff. This appears to be the prevailing view though it
may be difﬁcult to see what is added by registry staff signing off on the application
except that the government accepts liability for the error or fraud of the applicant or
land owner. This liability will depend on the extent to which the system provides for
rectiﬁcation.
If the system supports dynamic security there will be no rectiﬁcation even if the
registration is based on fraud, force or deceit in the electronic application. Dynamic
security is often referred to as indefeasibility43 and the principle of indefeasibility is
frequently advanced to justify the upholding of the register. If a mistake is made
then compensation, and not rectiﬁcation, will be the remedy for those deprived of
their interest in land. By contrast if the system supports static security there will be
rectiﬁcation whenever it is deemed fair.
This conﬂict can also be expressed as a dispute between the principles of
certainty and fairness. Certainty of the register will beneﬁt transferees and acqui-
sition lenders but this may be at the expense of a prior registered owner who is
blameless but is now being offered a sum of money instead of title to his home as if
they were “perfect substitutes”.44 The competing claims that may arise and how
these are dealt with in Ireland and Ontario is examined in Chap. 7.45
In a system with automatic registration it appears that there can be a reduction in
land registration stafﬁng levels. The checking function and the associated expense
is transferred to the conveyancer, usually a lawyer, and hence the house owner.46 It
could be argued that agency registration reduces the role of the registering authority
as the arbitrator of ‘good title’ and redeﬁnes it as an auditor which ensures
compliance47 with the business rules. The registering authority thus develops a
new role in authorising lawyers to conduct electronic conveyancing and an audit
function to ensure compliance with the speciﬁed requirements.48 The two new
41 Arrun˜ada (2010), p. 115. He notes at p. 116 that staff do perform some checks and audits after
registration but by then it is too late to change anything as the registrar’s powers of correction are
limited.
42 Arrun˜ada (2010), p. 119.
43 The particular legislative sections that provide for indefeasibility are often called “para-
mountcy” provisions. See the use of this term in Cooke and O’Connor (2004), p. 645.

functions would be to license users and then to promulgate and enforce practice
rules on those users. It would also have an obligation to maintain and update the
system.49
In Ontario the Director of Land Registration has the power to suspend the
authorisation of an applicant if (a) there is reasonable grounds to believe that the
person has submitted an electronic document that is not authorised by the registered
owner or is not otherwise authorised at law or (b) considers it in the public interest
to do so.50 This would be a serious sanction as it would prevent the lawyer from
practicing conveyancing. A new set of criteria were developed for the authorisation
of account holders in Ontario as part of the Real Estate Fraud Action Plan. These
included criteria about identity, ﬁnancial resources adequate to compensate victims
of fraud and good character/accountability.51 In effect all users were required to re
authenticate themselves as a fraud prevention measure.
In England and Wales it was proposed that entries on the register be made
directly by the lawyer and not by the registering authority52 however lawyers were
reluctant to take on this function.53 Lawyers, as professional users of the system, are
reluctant to be able to make changes to the register. They do not wish to be liable for
error or fraud and to be sued by the consumers who directly suffer the system
failure. Lawyers and other users do not want to become registrants. The same
concerns do not appear to have arisen in relation to simpler transactions which
are seen as presenting a lower risk and thus automated electronic discharge of a
charge by a lender has been implemented in England and Wales without the same
difﬁculties.
In Ireland it has been generally agreed between the stakeholders that “[i]n order
to ensure that the PRA’s responsibility for maintaining the register is not dimin-
ished, PRA ofﬁcials will continue to have input into applications for changes to the
register before the register is updated.”54 Thus the aim is to make the process
automated but not automatic.55 The registrar or staff in the registering authority will
need to act upon the electronic message or data transfer before a change in the title
register can take place. Kostova is of the view that the Irish choice to keep
registration automated rather than automatic should be welcomed.56 Keating
notes that this retention of the registering authority as the “ultimate decision
maker will play a crucial role in the balancing of risk in any proposed electronic
49 It is difﬁcult to see how the registrar would not also have a role in registration particularly where
rectiﬁcation of the title or boundaries is required.

conveyancing model.”57 Automation delivers most of the beneﬁts that the register-
ing authority tends to seek, allowing it to keep the state guarantee intact. Whereas
automatic registration would change its role to that of an enforcement and valida-
tion authority.
This is also the position in Ontario where the registry staff manually review
documents for compliance before registering or rejecting them. Section 23 of the
Land Registration Reform Act58 (hereafter the LRRA)59 stipulates that an elec-
tronic document delivered to the electronic land registration database by direct
electronic transmission is not registered until the land registrar registers it in the
prescribed manner. Similarly in British Columbia the registering authority reviews
applications to check compliance with legal requirements.60
However, many jurisdictions have built some of the simple checks that would
previously have been done by registry staff, into the electronic system in order to
generate efﬁciencies and reduce the level of manual input.61 They have also adopted
a “tell me, don’t show me” approach62 to the supporting documentation that would
previously have been required. The question arises as to whether these two develop-
ments of themselves have led to the possibility of more errors appearing in the title
register and thus a balance is to be achieved between efﬁciency and risk.
This eApplication phase becomes obsolete and subsumed into the next phase of
eConveyancing. Clancy calls this phase eLodgement of Applications for Registra-
tion and identiﬁes its key features as allowing professional customers to pay fees
on-line, build and track applications.63 Also key data is validated on-line and
pre-populates the register with drafts of the registration. He is of the view that
this “is the precursor to full eRegistration and, other than electronic supporting
documents, it contains most of the elements of full eRegistration.”64
O’Sullivan has divided this phase into two distinct parts; eApplication and
eLodgement.65 eApplication being the ordering of documents and services online
and eLodgement relating to the lodgement of applications resulting in changes to
57 Keating (2012), pp. 8–9.

59 The aim of the LRRA was to computerise, modernise and combine the unregistered and
registered systems.
60 Low (2005), p. 8. See also BC OnLine.
61 For example the system may automatically calculate the fee payable or force the applicant, or
registrant, to choose options from a predetermined list. In Ontario the system will not allow the
application to be lodged until certain required elements are completed. Similarly the ARTL system
requires all questions relevant to the application to be completed before it allows the application to
be submitted for registration.
62 This approach means that supporting documentation is not lodged in the registry. Instead the
applicant, or registrant, certiﬁes that such documentation has been executed and is held by them.
This approach can cause concern among lawyers who, rather than lodging such documentation in
the registry, now have to certify the existence of same while bearing the cost of storage.

the register. These two parts are linked. Together they form the second phase of
eConveyancing and the term eApplication will be used to denote this phase.
eRegistration is the third more sophisticated phase. This is truly part of an
eConveyancing system as the paper is now replaced with an electronic process
and this is the primary focus of eRegistration. The aim is to change the register
solely on the basis of electronic information without the need for paper documents
to be lodged. In the eApplication phase the electronic entry is ineffective unless it
mirrors the paper. The electronic application is a shadow of the paper application
and only has a provisional status.
By contrast in the eRegistration phase the electronic entry is the legal act that
leads to a change in the register. The data input has independent legal effectiveness
and is not dependent on a paper application. It may however be subject to a number
of factors. Firstly the electronic act must conform with the data that’s already on the
register. Second it must meet the business rules or other formalities laid down by
the registering authority for the electronic entry and thirdly, in most instances, it
must be signed off by staff in the registering authority.
In eConveyancing the implementation of the eRegistration phase generally
begins with the electronic discharge of registered charges by authorised users
(may be lawyers or lenders) and then moves on to electronic charges and ﬁnally
transfers.
British Columbia is an example of an eRegistration system. The Land Title and
Survey Authority (LTSA) operates an electronic ﬁling system (EFS)66 which
enables authorised persons such as lawyers and conveyancers to electronically
sign and submit documents to the authority. EFS operates through a web portal
known as BC Online. By the end of August 2013 the LTSA maintained a record of
over 2 million land titles with over 2.2 million active registered charges on those
titles.67
The fourth, most extensive and most sophisticated phase is eConveyancing
itself. The aim is to electronify not just the registration aspects of conveyancing
but the entire end to end process from pre-sale to post completion. Some physical
acts may however be excluded.68
Arrun˜ada suggests that there is no need for a physical closing act at all as digital
signatures allow consent to be given without a physical presence at closing.69
However this will only work if the client has a digital signature that meets the
needs for identity veriﬁcation. In most systems it is the lawyer, and not the client,
who has the digital signature.70 This may lead to additional risk and liability for the

lawyer and thus a rise in professional indemnity insurance71 premiums.72 Griggs
and Low highlight in respect of the national Australian system
that it is entirely possible that under an electronic system the allocation of risk and liability
will fall on the stakeholders involved in consummating the transaction, rather than the
landowner. The tension between these stakeholders (including conveyancers, lawyers,
registry ofﬁces, issuers of identity and the government) as to this allocation of risk is
palpable and will demand sensitive negotiation and much introspection and examination as
we embrace the efﬁciency, advantages, and complexity of the national electronic convey-
ancing system.73
Kostova similarly warns that the impact of such an increased risk of liability on
the success of any Irish system should not be underestimated.74
Perry takes the view that the central objective of eConveyancing is the elimina-
tion of the paper documents but the restriction of digital signatures to legal
representatives results in his view in its failure to achieve this objective.75 The
requirement to ensure that the client gives authority for the signing of the electronic
document has resulted in practices whereby the client applies a wet signature76 to a
paper copy of the electronic document or executes some other form of paper
authority.
In both Ontario and Scotland wet signatures are required from the client in order
to authorise the transaction. In Ontario this authority is kept on the lawyers ﬁle. In
Scotland it is lodged with the registering authority. The lawyer then uses his or her
digital signature on the basis of that paper authority. For Perry the “difﬁculty with
this solution is that a major part of the rationale behind e-conveyancing is destroyed
in the process.”77 He quotes an Ontario real-estate lawyer as noting that there seems
to be more paper rather than less in lawyers’ ﬁles as a result of the changes in
Ontario.78
In New Zealand a paper authorisation is executed and retained for 10 years. In
Scotland the paper authorisation is scanned and lodged with the registry. Instead of
removing paper documents from the process you now have an additional document
added to the conveyancing process and this document must be preserved for a
considerable length of time. This is problematic if you accept Perry’s view that
dematerialisation is the major driver of eConveyancing. Even if you do not accept
his view, the objective of reform is to generate efﬁciencies, not to add further
complexity and paper to the process.

These difﬁculties and risks can however be avoided by ensuring that the land
owner has his or her own digital signature and there is no interference with the role
of each stakeholder in the process i.e. land owners execute contracts and transfers as
normal, lawyers advise and witness, lenders lend and so on.
The eRecords, eApplication or eRegistration phases are sometimes referred to as
eConveyancing and there is no doubt that any eConveyancing system must also
include these. The development of these electronic processes are stepping stones on
the path towards full eConveyancing. Many jurisdictions have chosen to stop at
eRecords, eApplication or eRegistration and not proceed further. By contrast other
jurisdictions are planning to move forward to convert the entire conveyancing
process
to
an
electronic
platform
by
developing
complete
systems
of
eConveyancing. This would include that part of the conveyancing process prior
to registration i.e. drafting of the contract and assurance, execution of the contract
and assurance together with completion involving EFT of the purchase monies.
3.2.3
Relationship Between eRecords, eApplication,
eRegistration and eConveyancing
The relationship between the four phases of an overall eConveyancing system can
be represented by Fig. 3.1.
eRecords and eApplication are subsets of eRegistration and become subsumed
into eRegistration once the system moves into this phase. By contrast eRegistration
is retained as a distinct subset of eConveyancing as it relates solely to the registra-
tion element of the conveyancing process.79 It is the element of eConveyancing
involving direct participation by the registering authority.80 The ﬁnal phase is
eConveyancing itself which expands the electronic interaction to stakeholders
and other parts of the process separate from the registration element.
eRegistration involves electronic interaction between the registering authority
and users, usually lawyers, to facilitate electronic registration. eConveyancing
expands this interaction to other stakeholders such as lenders, surveyors and
auctioneers and it facilitates virtually all the phases of the conveyancing process
from pre sale to post completion.
eRegistration
necessarily
involves
automated
electronic
communication
between the users and registrar but it may not be automatic. In Ireland eRegistration
is taken to mean an automated but not an automatic system.
Figure 3.2 represents the same process but as a sequential timeline. Some of
these phases may run in parallel for periods of time until the next phase is fully
implemented.

Traditionally the conveyancing process is seen as being very paper based,
lacking transparency and with many inherent delays.81 This provides potential for
reform, transformation and process improvements. The case for reform may be
compelling but whether this reform should embrace eConveyancing is the subject
of much discussion and debate. Even if the conveyancing process requires reform
does this necessarily mean that eConveyancing will solve all its ills? Does
eConveyancing provide a realistic solution to difﬁculties in the process or is it a
mirage never to be achieved?
Paper based transactions are seen as been outdated and traditional and often the
existence of such paper is blamed for delays. The immediacy of email versus post
which can take one, two or more days to be delivered is seen as self-evident proof
that paper causes delay. While no one likes unnecessary delays, is the difference
between paper and electronic forms the source of delays in the conveyancing
process? Much rhetoric espouses the paper based process as being out of date,

traditional and ‘bad’ and the new modern electronic systems as being new, better
and ‘good’. But what exactly about paper based transactions is seen as being
outdated and traditional and where is the evidence for this?
Perhaps the delay is due to other factors such as the formalities associated with
completing a conveyancing transaction. There is a value in the formalities associ-
ated with executing a contract or deed so as to ensure that the client’s authority
cannot be questioned and the contract or deed subsequently set aside. The person
cannot deny their own signature and its witnessing. It is for this reason that many
jurisdictions, despite other advances towards dematerialisation, have still retained a
paper authority to be signed by the client with a wet signature.82
There is much written about the legal reasons for these formalities but little has
been written about their symbolic ceremonial purpose. This change of formalisation
has echoes with the past with the move from memory and storytelling to written
records. Such change in ritual is a ﬁeld of study in its own right and was explored by
Clanchy in his book From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307.83 He
explores the growth of practical literacy and the move from living memory to
written records. This can be seen as a continuum84 whereby society is now moving
from those written records to electronic data sets. This further change moves us
away from the formal symbolism of a physical document with its feudal connota-
tions towards dematerialisation.
All these changes can be seen as part of the information technology movement
even though it is now computers facilitating the change rather than the printing
press and the word IT was unknown in the twelfth century. Previous transforma-
tions show how technology can affect process, sometimes in unforeseen ways.85
When it comes to conveyancing many citizens and particularly land owners like
paper deeds.86 They like having paper ‘proof’ of ownership that they can hold. It is
a familiar concept and the holder may feel a sense of security that by holding the

burnt or destroyed just as a computer record can be deleted or infected by a virus.
In referring to the UK CREST system Micheler notes that electronic share
transfer has been very popular with institutional investors but there has been less
success with some private investors.87 She notes that this may be due to doubts
about the reliability of information technology in general and while owners of paper

certiﬁcates can personally ensure that they are stored securely the “owner of
uncertiﬁcated securities has no comparable means of ensuring that the electronic
records are properly maintained.”88
Despite fears and doubts the conveyancing process cannot remain immune to the
march towards eCommerce and eGovernment. Furlong is of the view that it is no
longer sufﬁcient to provide access to data. He believes that end users who regularly
book airline tickets or cinema tickets will also demand the same level of interactive
service online from government departments and agencies.89 “Those who prevar-
icate and ignore these changes will be neither digital natives nor digital immigrants,
but will be set to lose out – as digital dinosaurs.”90
3.2.4
eConveyancing in the Context of eCommerce
and eGovernment: Towards an Information Age
As land registration is under government control the delivery of registration
services electronically will focus a spotlight on the entire conveyancing process.
E-conveyancing is the single most signiﬁcant e-government initiative for the [legal]
profession. In stimulating legal e-business, the [England and Wales] Land Registry’s
e-conveyancing plans will affect all practitioners, not just conveyancers. New technology
and the Internet are already fuelling the dynamism of the conveyancing market.91
As this quote demonstrates in some jurisdictions the registering authority have
taken ownership of not just eRegistration but also eConveyancing as part of its
mandate to deliver eCommerce and eGovernment.92
eConveyancing can be seen as a subset of eCommerce and eGovernment. The
danger of eConveyancing however being conﬁned within eGovernment or being
delivered by the registering authority is that the parts of the process that relate to a
private transaction between the buyer and seller (the negotiation and contract) can
become blurred with the public transaction (completion and registration) and state
intervention (payment of tax). Government and state agencies should ensure that, in
engaging with eConveyancing, they do not stray into areas of private interaction
between citizens. Instead eConveyancing should be seen as overlapping with
eCommerce and eGovernment (Fig. 3.3).

Deﬁning Econveyancing

eGovernment has been
deﬁned as electronic interaction between government and the private sector or the citizen.
The possibilities for eGovernment have been enormously increased by the availability of
personal computers and the increasing penetration of the internet.93
It has also been deﬁned as the placing of existing government services online.94
Globalisation demands shared and reusable knowledge in all sectors of the
economy including the property market.95 The transformation of conveyancing
by the application of technological advances to a previously paper based process
is part of a wider move towards the values and technologies of the information
age.96 The term information society is also used to refer to “the increasing contem-
porary signiﬁcance of information and communication technologies (ICTS).”97
Castells refers to this new society as the network society and one of the key
dimensions of this new social structure is “the material transformation of our social
fabric, as new information technologies allow the formation of new forms of social
organization and social interaction along electronically based information net-
works.”98 He refers to this as a socially embedded process and not as an exogenous
factor affecting society.99
Other commentators are of the view that we have already moved on. Brande-
Lavridsen is of the view that we are leaving the network society and entering the
mobile society.100 In referring to the move from paper-based to dematerialised
dealings Harpum refers to a revolution.101 The extent of this change has been
compared with other signiﬁcant events in the past. “The unfolding inﬂuence of
these technologies across all areas of economic and social activity in the twenty-

ﬁrst century is increasingly seen in terms parallel to electricity in the twentieth, and
railroads in the nineteenth.”102
Harpum notes that this process has already occurred in other spheres such as the
trading of shares under the CREST system and this has attracted little attention
amongst academic commentators.103 This electronic trading system is operated by
the London Stock Exchange and allows a share broker to carry out the settlement
process electronically. The objective was to make securities transfer as safe and
efﬁcient as possible and thus increase the attractiveness of the marketplace.104
The CREST system has reduced the time that lapses between trade and settlement. It has
also caused transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares to be carried out almost simultaneously with
payment of the purchase price. This has signiﬁcantly reduced the transactional risk inves-
tors in shares are exposed to.105
CREST is just one example of the way information technology and online
service channels through computerisation have completely transformed the way
in which products and services are delivered.
It is perceived that those in charge of delivering such products and services are
under pressure from ordinary citizens to meet the full potential of this information
age by better service by way of more information and greater transparency.106
The rapid development of modern information and communications technologies is having
a dramatic impact on all aspects of life, including government. It is creating an environment
characterised by demands for timely delivery of information and services.107
The increase of uptake in broadband108 would suggest that businesses are
recognising that electronic communication systems are a key component in
maintaining competitiveness but in relation to citizens there is a question as to
whether they are driving online services or are online services driving demand? For
example the cheap ﬂights offered by Ryanair, which can only be booked online,
may have enticed many people on to the internet, including some who would not
otherwise seek electronic access to services.109
Many governments, including the Irish government, have increasingly commit-
ted themselves to the use of computer technology in the delivery of public ser-
vices.110 “[S]uccessful eGovernment systems send a signal to the rest of the world
that the economy is at the forefront of technology and that the business environment

is conducive to high-technology applications.”111 Various action plans have been
published about the potential of the information society,
raising expectations on the part of the general public. . .[which] have an evitable (sic)
impact on the legal profession and the service it provides. . .the day is surely rapidly
approaching when members of the public will not understand why in the age of the
computer a conveyancing transaction seems bedevilled with uncertainties, involves a
huge paper chase and seems to take an extraordinary time to complete.112
In 2008 McDonagh and White carried out an evaluation of eGovernment in
Ireland and found that “[o]verall the roll-out of eGovernment in Ireland, while
initially very promising, appears to have stalled somewhat.”113 They refer to a
number of very successful initiatives including motor tax online (www.motortax.
ie), etenders (www.etenders.gov.ie/), companies registration ofﬁce ﬁling (www.
cro.ie) and the PRA electronic access service (www.landregistry.ie/eng/landdirect_
ie/).114
Despite these successes there have, however, been a number of notable and high
proﬁle failures. These failures include www.reachservices.ie115 which was intended
to act as a single point of access to online public services in Ireland. This public
service broker project was a key eGovernment infrastructure project in that it aimed
to make all public services accessible online. The Comptroller and Auditor General
criticised the reach project. He found that “the feasibility of the project was not
examined early on and planning was weak. As a result, expectations for the project
were unrealistic, and implementation has been far slower and more costly than
anticipated.”116 The only transactions service provided was the Revenue online
service. Reach did not deliver the mandated integrated social services system and
responsibility has now been transferred.117
The progress of many projects was slower than planned and a substantial number
did not proceed or were abandoned after starting. Examples of abandoned projects
include on-line applications for passports, driving licences and registration on the
electoral register.118 Other examples of failed projects include the electronic voting
project119 and PPARS.120 On an examination the Comptroller and Auditor General

found that while many department and agencies claimed to have achieved efﬁcien-
cies arising from the implementation of eGovernment projects, only a few provided
hard evidence of substantial savings.121
The European Commission has also found Ireland’s information society perfor-
mance to be a “mixed picture, with some indicators (like eGovernment and
eCommerce) above the EU [European Union] average and others (like internet
access for citizens and businesses) below or close to the EU average.”122 In 2014
the Commission noted that Ireland’s Point of Single Contact remains under-
developed as it “is essentially only an information portal that does not provide
e-services or enable online applications and completion of procedures. . ..and the
absence of this capability negatively affects the free circulation of services.”123
The OECD also identiﬁed the necessity for Ireland to improve its performance in
this arena. Its 2008 public management review stated that
E-Government, and the development of a more integrated ICT interface, provides a major
opportunity to deliver faster, more readily accessible services and secure internal data
sharing to simplify contact with the Public Service. While Ireland has had many successes
in developing internal e-government systems, co-operation across different Public Service
bodies is not widespread. Fragmentation of responsibility for different elements of
e-government has meant that the full potential of ICT is not being realized by public sector
organizations for citizens.124
McDonagh and While are of the view that Ireland’s record is weakest in terms of
the delivery of the more sophisticated levels of eGovernment and they cite numer-
ous international benchmarking reports in support of this.125 There is however some
evidence of a regeneration of the government commitment to electronic service
delivery.
While eRegistration remains a ﬂagship project126 other recent initiatives include
the availability of planning documentation online by local authorities and http://
www.myplan.ie/en/index.html which provides information directly to citizens
about development and local area plans. The aim of this website is to create a one
stop shop for information relevant to planning decision making (such as census
records, heritage sites and patterns of housing development). It brings together
information from all planning authorities and is a clear demonstration of integrated
information delivery that can be of considerable beneﬁt not just to citizens but also
to public service providers. Another example is http://www.ﬁxyourstreet.ie/ which
allows citizens to report problems with public facilities such as roads, lighting,
illegal dumping or water leaks directly to their local council.

While these initiatives are a one way ﬂow of information and not sophisticated
digital transactional hubs they do demonstrate a commitment by government to
spend money on online projects and to allow citizens to engage online with public
services.
http://e.gov.ie/reporting/ also provides details of other projects. This website
facilitates reporting by public bodies to the eGovernment Policy Unit in the
Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This forms the basis for progress
reports on the 44 actions included in the current eGovernment strategy.127 Hope-
fully the success of these developments along with the beneﬁts of eRegistration128
will encourage the Irish government to move further and accelerate its penetration
into the digital arena.
While the term eConveyancing is not mentioned in the eGovernment strategy129
there are many aspects of eConveyancing that will assist in delivering the objec-
tives of this strategy. These include130:
•
providing a reduction in the administrative burden for citizens and businesses;
•
implementing digital delivery of applications for registration to the PRA;
•
ensuring greater interoperability of government services;
•
facilitating increased data sharing in relation to the property sector;
•
providing an electronic collaboration tool to empower citizens and businesses;
•
implementing business process improvements which deliver gains to all stake-
holders in the conveyancing process;
•
group transactional services around the life event of buying and selling property
and allows for this to be integrated across organisational boundaries;
•
incentivise take up of electronic services with the potential to link to ePlanning
and many other online eGovernment services; and
•
provide scope for gathering necessary statistical data about the property sector.
eConveyancing is included in the more recent Construction Strategy 2020
published by the government in May 2014.131 This strategy acknowledges that
conveyancing remains largely paper based and takes a disproportionate amount of
time
[t]herefore, a system of eConveyancing which harnesses modern technology to assist in the
timely transfer of property ownership would provide a more modern, efﬁcient, cost
effective and secure system to support transactions in the property market in the future.
Moving to a full eConveyancing system will require a number of further elements over and
above existing and planned developments to be put in place to provide for the secure
transmission of communications, the management and disbursement of funds between
parties and the creation and management of digital signatures.132

All of these developments ﬁt within the context of eCommerce and
eGovernment. This strategy adds to the compelling case for reform of the current
conveyancing system.
3.3
The Case for Reform
With the ever-increasing reliance of our society on information technology, it is perhaps not
surprising that information technology has been chosen as the means by which it is hoped to
modernise conveyancing – hence, electronic conveyancing.133
Many commentators have advocated eConveyancing as a means of achieving
this modernisation.134 In 2005 the then Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, acknowl-
edged that modernisation, simpliﬁcation and reform of land law and conveyancing
was long overdue and that eConveyancing would bring this process into the twenty-
ﬁrst century.135
No one could possibly argue against that as being a highly desirable and indeed, essential
goal. With all aspects of Irish life enjoying unprecedented modernisation – transport,
infrastructure, communications – why should the legal profession allow itself. . .to, remain
in the past.136
The application of technology is seen as a means of standardising and simplify-
ing the conveyancing process, improving efﬁciency and providing transparency.
The development of eConveyancing has been advocated as a ‘cure all’ solution to
the difﬁculties presented by a centuries old, paper based, traditional process that on
the face of it appears to no longer ﬁt the twenty-ﬁrst century. In moving towards
eConveyancing there is the opportunity to redeﬁne and re-engineer processes as
part of the reform programme to take maximum advantage of available technolo-
gies.137 Kostova applauds this determination to make conveyancing easier, cheaper
and more efﬁcient, noting that “great hopes have been invested in the development
of an end-to-end fully electronic system of conveyancing.”138
To some extent the case for reform has been predicated on the need to be seen to
be making advances in line with other related jurisdictions rather than a compre-
hensive cost beneﬁt analysis.139 The complexity of such an analysis has meant that

137 The Law Society of Ireland (2008a) insists that it would be a fundamental mistake to digitise

to suit the online environment.

Deﬁning Econveyancing

jurisdictions have chosen to rely on other evidence to advocate eConveyancing. The
Irish Law Reform Commission is of the view that the “experience in other juris-
dictions has shown that a business case does exist for undertaking an
eConveyancing initiative of this nature.”140 The experience drawn upon is that of
Ontario, England and Wales, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.
Many commentators have however relied upon perceived beneﬁts rather than
empirical data. This process whereby ‘perceived’ innovation is adopted is reﬂected
in innovation-diffusion literature. Abrahamson looks at the diffusion literature and
divides it into two types.
The ﬁrst claims that fads or fashions facilitate the diffusion of technically inefﬁcient
administrative technologies. . ..A second type of account claims that fads or fashions
harm organizations’ economic performances because they prompt rejections of adminis-
trative technologies that had the potential to become technically efﬁcient for their
adopters.141
Do organisations imitate other organisations in order to appear legitimate by
conforming to emergent norms that sanction these innovations?142 Is this the case
with eConveyancing? Is it the new fad or fashion?
While Abrahamson has focused on the literature from an organisational point of
view other commentators look at it from the perspective of social systems. Levi-
Faur has deﬁned:
diffusion as the process by which the adoption of innovation by member(s) of a social
system is communicated through certain channels and over time and triggers mechanisms
that increase the probability of its adoption by other members who have not yet adopted
it. . ..Their own particularistic order is then “exported” or “projected” globally as a “uni-
versal rationality”143
He points out that new sources of change have emerged since the 1980s and these
sources include technological innovations.144 While looking in particular at the spread
of regulatory approaches across jurisdictions, his comments are of equal interest in the
context of legal processes which would require the backing of new regulation.
Rogers points out that the internet has created increased interest in the study of
diffusion and particularly in the role of communication networks in the diffusion
process.145 This according to Levi-Faur is a reﬂection of an increasingly
interdependent world.146 Hence when change is sought or demanded it is not

surprising that decision makers look to advances made in other jurisdictions in
order to benchmark their own organisation or system. What is surprising is that
decision makers so readily accept the perceived beneﬁts articulated by adopters of
change in other jurisdictions, who themselves have a vested interest in their new
systems being perceived to be a success.147 Relying on such a weak rationale for
expensive systems, it is then not surprising when they often fail to be a success.
Few jurisdictions appear to have carried out a detailed risk assessment before
advancing eConveyancing or if they have these results are not in the public domain.
The exception to this is Australia which carried out a risk assessment of NECS (now
PEXA) with the ﬁnal report published on the 9 February 2007.148 This risk
assessment focused primarily on possible system failures.149
Despite this there is a considerable amount of literature advocating the advan-
tages of eConveyancing. Gahan lists them as including150:
(a) round the clock availability (presumably for authorised users);
(b) clearer and quicker interaction with quicker responses (again presumably for
authorised users in getting information from the electronic system);
(c) reduced administrative burden on the customer side (presumably he is referring
to the customer not having to complete and post paper documents);
(d) higher productivity on the government side because the data can be processed
more quickly compared to paper-based forms (this is likely a reference to the
pre-population of data that can occur in a computer based system);
(e) facilitating information-sharing and analysis of trends; and
(f) improved national competitiveness.
As Connolly points out:
Even the most superﬁcial examination of the conveyancing process reveals the potential for
the use of ICT, the retrieval of information being the most obvious, as the kernel of a
conveyancing transaction is the retrieval of information about the property and those who
claim an interest in it.151
147 Rogers criticizes the pro-innovation bias of diffusion research and says this is a serious
shortcoming caused by the research being funded by change agencies and a rejected and/or
discontinued innovation is less likely to be investigated by a researcher. The implication is that
either researchers are biased because they have been ‘bought’ or only successful innovations
receive publicity and kudos. Of course researchers may be biased and it is possible that unsuc-
cessful innovations are more likely to be covered up but it is cynical to taint all diffusion research
with these shortcomings. See Rogers (2003), pp. 106 and 110.

It will be possible to update ownership on the land register as soon as completion
of the transaction has taken place and to immediately have this information
available to all stakeholders. The availability of this information in real time has
the potential to remove risk and cut out delay.152
The beneﬁts of eConveyancing and eRegistration were also discussed at the
UNECE WPLA Workshop on the Inﬂuence of Land Administration on People and
Business held in Croatia on the 2nd and 3rd October 2008. These beneﬁts were
identiﬁed as including the prevention of multiple registration which is time con-
suming and as the registration takes less time it meets the need of the market;
reducing the risk of incorrect data153; and increasing the possibility of transparency
and the opportunity to “[m]ake all necessary information available to the players of
the real estate market internal and external users (professionals, buyers and sellers)
at one place at the Internet.”154
The prevention of multiple registration could mean a move from several regis-
ters to one register and the expansion of that one register to reﬂect all the required
information.155 Locke explains an approach that is being explored in Australia
whereby the land registry would continue to maintain the title register but would
also be an online portal to information maintained by other agencies.156 This idea of
an electronic hub for all information relating to land has been adopted in many
jurisdictions.157 In some the land registry is taking on this role158 and in others it is
private enterprise159 or a public private partnership.160
For Perry the thrust of the electronic communications revolution161 or evolution,
including eConveyancing, is towards greater connectivity.162 Currently the infor-
mation about property is stored by a variety of bodies. For example the lawyer has
to retrieve information about planning from the local authority. Information about
any tax liability has to be sought from Revenue. A variety of registers have to be
searched for details of any encumbrances on the property. Wylie, states that it
would be much easier if this information was stored in computer databases which
were interlinked and easily accessible.163
152 See Sect. 6.2 for a more detailed analysis.
153 This may only be true if there is some means of the data being validated as it is entered into the
system.

sion for Europe’s Working Party (2008).

This would beneﬁt not just the lawyer but other stakeholders in locating the
information required to complete the legal and procedural formalities to complete a
conveyancing transaction. For the land owner it is likely to mean that the transac-
tion time and cost is reduced.
An example of this is the setting up of the Land and Property Services Agency in
Northern Ireland in 2008. This brought together the Rate Collection Agency, the
Valuation and Lands Agency, Ordnance Survey and the Land Registers with the
aim of delivering integrated mapping, registration, valuation and rating services.
Similarly Ireland plans to amalgamate the PRA, Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) and
the Valuation Ofﬁce.164 These changes are in line with the UNECE guidelines for
land administration which recommend that a single agency be responsible for land
administration.165
This may mean the expansion of the title register beyond its traditional role166
and possibly, by implication, the creation of new registered titles in land. This
aspect and its implications are explored further in Chap. 8.
The Australian States appear to have embraced the possibilities afforded by
these changes. In Australia water licences which previously attached to speciﬁc
land parcels are now being converted to water allocations which can be bought,
sold, mortgaged and sub-divided.167 They do not have the beneﬁt of a government
guarantee or statutory indefeasibility but do “beneﬁt from the same principles of
priority and certainty in resource ownership that applies to interests recorded in the
freehold land register.”168 Queensland is also examining how it might register
sub-terrain storage areas and Western Australia has created a new interest in land
called a carbon right which is the right to the beneﬁts and risks arising from carbon
sequestration and release on a parcel of land.169 There is an argument however that
these new registered interests are created to meet the demands of a changing society
and have nothing intrinsically to do with eRegistration.170 In Ireland the registering
authority is similarly looking at extending its scope through the development of
synergies with other state agencies such as providing a link to planning data.171 The
registering authority has already agreed to supply land parcel data to the

development of eRegistration. Instead he examines them in the context of the challenges and
opportunities faces by the land registries and the use of the land titling system to support efﬁcient
operation of markets which are of signiﬁcant value to the economy. See Locke (2007), pp. 3 and 8.

Alternatively the reference to a prevention of multiple registration by the
UNECE WPLA173 may mean a move from registration several times in the one
register to a necessity to only register once.174 The UNECE WPLA noted that a
balance must be achieved between transparency and data protection to maintain
conﬁdence in the system and combat new ways of fraud175 but session 4 concluded
that land administration authorities should improve by making new services based
on
eGovernment
and
electronic
signatures,
following
the
one
stop-shop
principle.176
Sabaliauskas and Mikuta explain this principle as meaning that as:
information [in electronic documents] is entered and examined only once, [the] probability
of errors is minimised. [And with an] [i]ntegrated environment all actions are performed
within the framework of one system.177
The potential is for the data entered into the system by authorised users to be
automatically veriﬁed by the system and checked against data already validated and
this presents the opportunity to minimise any errors.
Data amendment however is likely to be much more difﬁcult than data entry.
Any errors already in the system are likely to be replicated in future entries and thus
veriﬁcation and validation of the initial data entry is a key requirement. Limiting
access to the system to authorised users and retaining a ﬁnal sign off before
registration to staff of the registering authority are some of the means of retaining
control over the data. The design of the system is also a key factor so as to minimise
input errors.
While single entry will likely decrease entry errors the likelihood of any errors
already in the system being discovered is reduced. The data already in the system
will only be checked once instead of multiple times. Input errors may be minimised

174 This could mean a move from several registers e.g. tax, planning, title, to one register and the
expansion of that one register to reﬂect all the required information about the property.
175 For an examination of the move from a closed to an open register in England and Wales see
Timothy (2007). The Irish title register is also an open register but the original title documents on
which the register is based are only available to authorised persons. See Deeney (2014), p. 73.
176 An example of this principle is the National Land Information System (NLIS) in England and
Wales which provides a hub or channel for conveyancing searches. This is a commercial service
licensed and regulated by government. For a recent review of this service see ConsultingWhere

but process errors may be maintained as they may not be detected if there is no
double checking.178
However, there is potential to limit further errors entering the system.
McDermott notes that due to in-built system prompts and automatic calculation
of registration fees the on-line form completion in the Irish landdirect.ie system is
leading to a signiﬁcantly lower incidence of errors in the documentation presented
for registration.179 According to Deeney eRegistration will address to a large degree
the common administrative errors such as payment of the incorrect fee, inadequate
completion of forms and use of the wrong folio reference.180 In Ontario the e-reg
system automatically warns the user when a draft registration is incomplete so that
signing and registration are only allowed after all mandatory information has been
submitted.181
Treacy and O’Sullivan also list some of the major beneﬁts to users of the Irish
Land Registry’s Electronic Access Service.182 These include improved timeliness
and speed of service, improved convenience, on-line data is far more usable and
ﬂexible, improved service through local ofﬁces and improved business processes in
other government departments and agencies.183
In Ontario Moore and Globe set out the goals of land registration reform as
including to simplify conveyancing law and procedure, reduce the costs of con-
veyancing and standardise law, terminology and procedure.184 While remaining
concerned about digital signatures, Kostova acknowledges that eConveyancing
could remove some of the risks and delays.185
Other beneﬁts of eConveyancing were articulated at the CINDER XVI Interna-
tional Congress on Registration Law held in Valencia, Spain from the 20th to 22nd
May 2008. At that forum Ra¨tsep set out the following reasons for eConveyancing
being much easier:
activities are half-automated which means registration is more efﬁcient and . . . routine
work can be done without human intervention. Texts of entries are composed automatically
as they base (sic) on templates. Thanks to digital structured data exchange there are fewer
mistakes and less paper. Information system is sustainable and can be easily developed
further. It is easy to get statistics. You can get land register information everywhere you
have internet connection, it is possible to build new online services according to clients’
needs. And information you get from the register has legal power electronically186

Deﬁning Econveyancing

Taka´cs, in referring to Hungary, sees a different change in land registration. He
points out that the changing function of real estate from being “only a property” to
being a tool of investment and a source of income increases the importance of land
registration.187 This ‘commodity-isation’ of land ownership is a recurring theme. It
is reﬂected in the conﬂict between use value and exchange value which has become
more evident in the development of the complex commodities market.188 Use value
reﬂects the value an occupier will put on having possession and use of a property
and this aspect is particularly important in the context of the family home. By
contrast, exchange value focuses on the monetary value of the property, as a
commodity or asset, the value of which can be realised by sale, lease, exchange
or mortgage.
Land registration must provide prompt case management, reliability, simplicity,
elasticity and legal security.189 For many registries the move to eRegistration
provides the opportunity to fulﬁll this brief. While acknowledging it is:
axiomatic that reducing the number of procedures generates simplicity and efﬁciency. . .
[Clancy is of the view that] there is a limit to the level of simpliﬁcation that is effective....
Obviously, if a ﬁgure lower then one [procedure] is achieved, then there is no system. As a
corollary, on what basis do we then presume that a number greater than one is a weakness?
Is there a risk that a disproportionate emphasis on reducing the number of procedures could
lead to an erosion of the integrity and security of registration?190
Similarly Arrun˜ada warns that some solutions do not achieve real simpliﬁcation
but instead lead to a mere transfer of paperwork and that standardisation can lead to
a more abstract register which forces the parties to rely on contract documents.191
Gaining access to these documents can then constrain the transaction as they will be
held by individual stakeholders.192
There are, however, few dissenting voices among the overwhelming support
expressed for eConveyancing. Perry says there has been widespread acceptance by
lawyers that eConveyancing would be a change for the better partly due to their
reluctance to be seen as backward looking and partly due to feeling that the
introduction of new technology is inevitable.193 He is of the view that these facts
tend to stiﬂe any opposition to the introduction of eConveyancing and such
unquestioning acceptance often results in a lack of any real scrutiny.194 Given
that the implementation of any new system is a challenging process and failures are
not uncommon, “it is unwise to assume that the introduction of e-conveyancing is,
at a practical level, in any way inevitable, as is often asserted.”195 His views are

very much aligned with some of those expressed in the diffusion-innovation
literature referred to earlier.
One of the main beneﬁts of eConveyancing is often cited as cost savings. Perry
takes the view that the absence of cost savings, or even a substantial increase in
costs, are not necessarily by themselves reasons not to adopt eConveyancing if the
new system is more efﬁcient than the old system.196 He points out that the economic
beneﬁt in the long term of IT investment is a difﬁcult area and generates a lot of
disagreement. It is rare that the effects of different systems are compared.197 Perry
cites Ma¨hring as evidence of research that suggests the risks of large IT projects are
not properly appreciated by those who end up bearing the consequences should
things go wrong.198
As noted previously Sneddon having carried out a detailed risk assessment over
5 months of the Australian NECS (now PEXA) system expressed the view that
eConveyancing systems “may have more concentrated points of failure than paper
based systems, for the same reasons that they generate greater efﬁciencies.”199
Griggs argues that eConveyancing will have many advantages but also questions if
it will allow those committing fraud to offend on a wider scale.200
Having looked at the limited information on costing available for a number of
systems Perry takes the view that “the argument that the introduction of
e-conveyancing will make conveyancing cheaper is almost certainly incorrect”
but qualiﬁes this to the extent that costs for land registration may be reduced as
the process of updating the register is automated.201 His conclusion is that claims
made about the cost advantages of eConveyancing do not usually withstand
detailed scrutiny and the costs are usually substantially underestimated.202 He
notes that in New Zealand and Ontario project costs were more than originally
anticipated.203 These costs ultimately have to be paid by the consumer.204 Butt also
notes that the many criticisms leveled at eConveyancing is how much the system
will cost and the problem is we just don’t know.205
196 Perry (2003a), p. 29. While an increase in costs might be justiﬁed for other beneﬁts it would be
difﬁcult to justify any substantial increase in costs even if short term.

Deﬁning Econveyancing

Brown notes that inevitably there will be a fee for the operating licence and
premiums on indemnity insurance may increase206 but this will be offset by
efﬁciency savings. However in Ontario LawPRO the insurer for lawyers
changed their requirements in order to take into consideration the changes to real estate
practice from electronic registration. . ..[and] waived certain deductibles related to elec-
tronically registered documents provided certain protocols have been followed.207
Thus it may be possible, given the increased certainty in the system, to negotiate
savings with the professional insurers.208
Arrun˜ada is also critical of eConveyancing advances.209 He looks at some of the
tradeoffs involved in substituting tasks performed by humans with computers and
expresses concern about the risk of transferring costs and risks instead of reducing
them.210 He is also of the view that the beneﬁt of immediacy of results may be
illusory because eConveyancing makes indefeasibility unsustainable in the long
term due to a greater incidence of fraud211 and thus will debase the registry into a
mere recording of rights.212 His perspective is, however, on the basis of the
New Zealand automatic system and as Kostova puts it so articulately “if solicitors
are not commonly forging their clients’ signatures in the paper-based system, the
introduction of digital signatures is not likely to lure them over to the dark side of
fraud.”213
Arrun˜ada gives the example of the Victoria system which cost $40–50 million
but only registered a single pilot transaction in its ﬁrst 18 months of operation

210 Arrun˜ada (2010), p. 118. Grinlinton (2003), p. 218 notes that transactions remotely registered
by conveyancers may not be subject to the same scrutiny and there is a strong possibility that a
substantial number of errors may infect the system and sit latent on the register possibly for many
years.
211 Thomas is also critical of the New Zealand system on the basis that it makes the title less secure
due to the removal of the paper title document and non-intervention of registry staff. Also the new
system transfers more risk to conveyancers for fraudulent and incorrect transactions. See Thomas
(2003), pp. 366–367.
212 Arrun˜ada (2010), p. 118.
213 Kostova (2010), p. 28. Two recent cases where solicitor fraud did occur in the paper environ-
ment relate to Michael Lynn and Thomas Byrne. Both engaged in mortgage fraud causing losses to
ﬁnancial institutions of amounts estimated to be in excess of 100 million euro. See Law Society of
Ireland (2008b), p. 12. See also Keating (2012), pp. 20–21. Deeney refers at p. 373 to two serious
cases of fraud coming to the attention of the Irish registering authority in October 2007, “one of
which related to the fraudulent registration of the ownership of a large number of investment
properties and the registration of multiple fraudulent mortgages.” It is likely that this is a reference
to the fraud perpetuated by Lynn and Byrne. See Deeney (2014). It is surprising that there have
been no reported court cases arising from these frauds.

because both banks and conveyancers refused to participate.214 Under pressure
from the banks a National Electronic Conveyancing System (NECS) was under
consideration and in 2010 NECS was replaced by National E-Conveyancing
Development Limited (NECDL). From 3 March 2014 NECDL became known as
PEXA.215 In 2013 the four major banks all joined the project216 as part of release
1 and began doing single party transactions such as new mortgages, discharges and
reﬁnancing online.217 An ambitious roll out schedule is now in place with transfer
and ﬁnancial settlement functionality to be deployed in New South Wales and
Victoria in autumn 2014 and other territories coming on stream during 2015.218 The
ﬁrst practitioner to use the platform did so in June 2014 by lodging a caveat on a
Victorian title.219 After a rocky start it appears that this huge project appears to be
well on its way to success.
The experience in England and Wales however provides a stark warning to any
jurisdiction tempted to view eConveyancing as an easy task. The chain matrix
project and Home Information Pack (HIP) initiatives were both shelved after a
considerable amount of money had been expended220 and more recently the move
to etransfers has been put on hold.221 Land Registry consultation with stakeholders
showed that the majority of respondents were not persuaded that etransfers were
desirable or achievable, they felt that the echarge solution did not meet their needs
and signiﬁcant concern was expressed that the process for creating and applying
electronic signatures was too complicated.222 Only 20 or so echarges were done
between 2009 and 2011.223
Thus in 2011 £6.4 million of development costs attributable to electronic
charges, signatures and transfers was written off with the Land Registry making
the decision to focus on electronic lodgement and dispatch whereby customers can
use electronic channels to send in paper documents.224 More recently in January
2014 the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills published a consultation
document re the introduction of a Land Registry service delivery company.225 This
company would take over responsibility for processing land and property

registration under the oversight of a government Chief Land Registrar. This pro-
posal has not been well received by key stakeholders.226 It begs the question of
what went wrong and is outsourcing to the private sector ‘punishment’ for the
failure to deliver eConveyancing?227 This experience presents a warning to regis-
tering authorities not to stray into areas of private interaction between citizens
particularly if there is not clear stakeholder support.228 Keating refers to ‘a cau-
tionary tale’ noting that the halt to full eConveyancing in England and Wales
reﬂects the multi-dimensional challenges that regulators and policy makers face
when considering the introduction of eConveyancing.229
Kostova notes that initial plans are often ambitious, with consideration given to
full end-to-end eConveyancing, but “after some deliberation and consultation, a
slightly more modest solution is usually introduced instead.”230 England and Wales
provides a timely example of this.231 Australia has also struggled but is now moving
forward swiftly with PEXA. Given that this project encompasses the multiple states
and territories in Australia, each with its own laws and registering authority, it is an
admirable feat and provides inspiration for other jurisdictions.
The critical viewpoints expressed by Perry and Arrun˜ada have failed to ﬁnd
widespread support.232 Perry’s opinion that there is a lack of real scrutiny and
unquestioning acceptance of eConveyancing advances,233 is certainly evident in the
lack of empirical data put forward by commentators advocating eConveyancing.234
Connolly expresses the view that Irish house purchasers could save as much as
40 million euro per year in transaction costs through efﬁciency savings235 but she
does not explain the basis for this ﬁgure.
226 Cross (2014).
227 Outsourcing or the involvement of private sector ﬁnance is not new in the delivery of land
information services. In England and Wales NLIS is a commercial service licensed and regulated
by government. For a recent review of this service see ConsultingWhere Limited and ACIL Allen
Consulting for LINZ (Land Information New Zealand) (2013), pp. 64–72 and Annex A to that
report. See also p. 81 of the ﬁnal report which notes that Landweb Direct in Northern Ireland was
one of the ﬁrst ﬁnancially free-standing information technology projects in the Private Finance
Initiative (PFI) ﬁeld. The model in Ontario is also one where the government has outsourced
operation of the land registry to private enterprise. See Annex B to the report. The role of Public
Private Partnerships in Australia is also addressed in Annex C. With this report New Zealand is
examining the beneﬁts to be gained by moving in this direction.

3.3
The Case for Reform
85

Many commentators and politicians see eConveyancing as a panacea to solve all
ills. In commenting on the reform of land law in Ireland in 2006 the then Ta´naiste
and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expressed the view that
“eConveyancing has, I believe, the capacity to simplify the conveyancing process
and reduce costs for all those involved in property transactions and it is, therefore, a
prize worth striving for.”236 More recently the European Commission in its 2014
Assessment of Ireland’s national reform and stability programme recognises the
moves to extend title registration and notes that this “should facilitate a complete
e-Conveyancing system and reduce delays.”237
There is certainly the potential for signiﬁcant improvement in the Irish convey-
ancing process and many of these have been articulated in interviews with repre-
sentatives from stakeholder groups.238 Whether eConveyancing can deliver all
these improvements has yet to be determined and much depends on the system
design.
The skepticism expressed by a minority of commentators has failed to halt the
ongoing advance of IT into the conveyancing process and surely a regulated,
organised, communal system has to provide more security for property transactions
over and above that offered by ordinary email. Even if property owners are not
demanding change, is it not incumbent upon key stakeholders to deliver improve-
ments in the process whenever possible in the public interest? Obviously what is in
the public interest may be a matter of debate and more research is needed to
contribute to that dialogue.
It is important to note that the failures, and much of the critical commentary,
relate to jurisdictions that have implemented, or attempted to implement, automatic
eRegistration, those that have attempted to deliver initiatives without stakeholder
consultation and agreement or where the government, through its state agencies,
has attempted to move outside eRegistration into the wider eConveyancing process.
It can be seen from developments to date that Ireland is not likely to encounter these
pitfalls.
Ireland does not propose to implement automatic eRegistration. There has been
considerable stakeholder consultation since publication of the Law Reform Com-
mission report in 2006 and the registering authority is focusing its remit on
delivering eRegistration and not eConveyancing. Thus provided the system design
is robust and based on a sound business case there is every reason to be optimistic
for the success of the Irish eConveyancing project.

3.4
Development of eConveyancing in Ireland and Ontario
The development of eConveyancing to date in Ireland and Ontario is set out under
the headings of eRecords, eApplication, eRegistration and eConveyancing. The
initiatives in each jurisdiction are examined based on the degree to which they meet
the criteria of each phase as deﬁned in the neutral vocabulary and as set out earlier
in this chapter.
3.4.1
eConveyancing in Ireland
Background
The Irish Law Reform Commission published its report entitled eConveyancing:
Modelling of the Irish Conveyancing System239 in 2006. BearingPoint were hired
as consultants and their report is published as an appendix to the Law Reform
Commission’s Report. Together they have become known as the BearingPoint
report.
The Law Reform Commission identiﬁed three workstreams as setting out a
roadmap for eConveyancing; a development workstream, process improvement
workstream and legislative changes workstream.240 While there has been much
legislative reform, to date there has been less progress on the other workstreams.
However even before the BearingPoint report the Irish Land Registry was engaged
in modernisation that fell within the remit of eRegistration.
eRecords
Initially the registration authority commenced a major programme of data capture
of existing paper documents in tandem with the development of a new system for
extensive on-line searching and retrieval of title records. This new system, intro-
duced in 1999, was called the Electronic Access Service (EAS) and then renamed as
landdirect.ie in April 2006. This service is the public interface of an internal Land
Registry project entitled Integrated Title Registration Information System (ITRIS).
ITRIS provides support for staff throughout the registration process including
electronic storage and retrieval of ownership records, tracking and processing of
applications, generation and transmission of electronic correspondence and provi-
sion of key statistics.241 The title records are called folios242 and title plans. Title

plans are the maps attached to the folios and they were previously known as ﬁled
plans. Folios set out details of the registration and any burdens thereon.
Part of the registration authorities’ strategy to deliver its services electronically
required the conversion of all paper title records into electronic records. This
conversion programme commenced early in 2002 and was completed in 2004.
The conversion of these paper records into electronic format involved the scanning
and indexing of 6.4 million pages of ofﬁcial records and this data capture led to
improved timeliness and speed of service with instantaneous inspections of title
records, automated copying services and a reduction in time taken to process certain
applications.243
EAS and subsequently landdirect.ie is an internet based service delivery system.
It was the ﬁrst eGovernment project to ‘go live’ in the Irish civil service.244 The
main objective was to simplify access to records and improve the timeliness of
information thus providing a better quality and more responsive service.245
Authorised users can do on-line searches, view and print ownership records, view
and track the progress of pending applications, apply for copies of records and
prepare and complete applications for registration. Initially those who are not
authorised users could access some of this information but only by contacting the
registering authority in person or by post. In 2011 however the registration authority
started to make the searching, viewing and printing of ownership records available
online to the general public on a trial basis. This was ‘very well received’ and by the
end of 2012 map and folio data for all counties was available online to non-account
holders.246
The legislation to support these changes was introduced in 2006. Section 50 of
the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006247 (hereafter the 2006 Act) amended
the deﬁnitions in the 1964 Act by providing that record would include information
in electronic or other non-legible form and register would include and be deemed to
always have included any register kept in electronic or other non-legible form.
By 2008 over 95 % of all searches and applications for certiﬁed copy documents
were conducted on-line through landdirect.ie.248 Full access to all maps via a digital
mapping project was completed in August 2010. This involved the conversion into
digital format of approximately 2.5 million land parcel boundaries249 and brought
to an end a 10 year programme of converting the national title register into digital
format.250 This completed the eRecords phase of eRegistration.

eApplication
The registration authority has also moved into eApplication. It developed an electronic
application form called eForm 17 that can be lodged using landdirect.ie. This form
interacts dynamically with the Land Registry database, facilitating accurate input of
information and calculation of the fee to be paid. . ..The effect is to considerably reduce
the common errors which arose in applications made in the manual system. It validates key
data online and pre-populates the register with drafts of the appropriate registrations
leading to signiﬁcant improvements in efﬁciency.251
Upon lodging the form there is also the advantage that users receive a dealing
reference number instantaneously and can then track the application through the
registration process.
As eApplication retains the paper documents any errors come to light when the
paper is lodged. In the case of a conﬂict between the electronic application and the
paper, the paper document prevails as this is the legally effective application.
This eApplication element of eRegistration was introduced in late 2002 and by
2007 this facility had grown to represent over 32 % of all applications for registra-
tion and over 98 % of some services were conducted online exclusively.252 During
2012 almost three million searching and certiﬁcation transactions were processed
through the landdirect.ie portal.253
The growth of landdirect.ie has been a tremendous success for the Irish regis-
tering authority as represented by Table 3.1.254
While anyone can apply to be a registered user of the service the vast bulk are
solicitors and law searchers.255 Other users include lenders, government depart-
ments, surveyors and law enforcement agencies.
As at 1 June 2014 67 % of applicants used the online application form,256 59 %
used the eDischarge facility257 and 95 % of applications for certiﬁed copy docu-
ments were done online.258 Taking into account the fact that the eDischarge system
does not facilitate partial discharges 59 % is a high percentage of take up. The PRA
conﬁrms that there has been a 99.9 % accuracy rate in these applications.259 This
compares very favourably with overall rejection rates as set out in Table 3.2.260

There have been productivity gains as a result of the move towards electronic
services particularly the folio data capture completed in 2009 and digital mapping
project completed in 2010.261 In relation to eDischarges the PRA estimates that
there has been about an 85 % reduction in manual staff input as a result of the
initiative.262 The growth of electronic services has meant that the PRA has deliv-
ered instantaneous access to information to its customers and also maintained
ongoing services despite signiﬁcant reductions in staff.263
The 2012 Annual Report conﬁrms that all electronic applications for eDischarge
and eNursing Home charges264 were completed within 2 days.265 75 % of mainstream
cases for registration are completed within 10 working days and 80 % of online
applications for folios and title plans are issued within 24 h.266 In addition during
2010 there was a 32 % reduction in the backlog of casework in the Land Registry.267
This was further reduced by 33 % in 2011268 and 11 % in 2012.269 Thus eApplication
has proved to be a successful initiative and provides a framework for eRegistration.
eRegistration
The third strategic objective of the PRA is to contribute to the eConveyancing
programme270 and this will be done by the roll out of eRegistration services. The
key principles of the eRegistration project are standardised forms, no lodgment of
paper documents, registrations relating to registered land only, voluntary usage
incentivised by differential fees and payment of registration fees by EFT.271

The ﬁrst element of eRegistration went live in March 2009.272 This was
eDischarges with a new system for electronic release of registered charges.273
This project developed a secure system for releasing registered charges where no
paper is lodged, issued or stored.274 The electronic discharge is lodged by the lender
and in order to facilitate this there is no fee.275 The system is automated not
automatic as the registrar continues to sign off on the cancellation of charges
from the register. This system won the state body category at the Public Sector
Times 2010 eGovernment Awards276 and usage of the eDischarge system has
exceeded the land registry’s expectations.277 Approximately 90 % of the lending
market is signed up to use the system.
Some of the reasons for this may include the fact that the system is subsidised in
order to incentivise take up.278 There is no fee charged to the lender. The lender is
acting directly in respect of its own charges so there is no agency problem. Also it
could be said that lenders are used to the need for secure systems and thus there may
have been less of a familiarisation issue. The project board also engaged in
extensive consultation with the lenders to ensure that the system addressed their
security concerns.
The registering authority also developed an online portal, eRegistration.ie, for
the electronic registration of all transactions affecting the title register.279 The
second eRegistration service was added to this portal in January 2010. This allows
the Health Services Executive to electronically register charges (eCharging Orders)
created under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. The signature of the chargee is
not required and thus the power to create the charge rests solely with the Health
Services Executive.
Based on the success280 of eDischarges and eCharging Orders the PRA rolled
out a further development in April 2013.281 This allows a lawyer to generate the
documentation for registration (transfers) and have them approved by the lawyer
for the other party to the transaction. Thus registered users can collaborate in
generating the documentation for registration. The ﬁnal documents are based on
data submitted to and retrieved from the system and the format of such documents
272 See Law Society of Ireland (2009). See also the Land Registration Rules 2008 (SI 326/2008)

are in compliance with the relevant rules. This pre-population and automatic
formatting of documentation reduces the risk of error and the possibility of the
application for registration being rejected. Multiple data entry is avoided thus
minimising the potential for errors. The system also facilitates electronic corre-
spondence between the lawyers and the acquisition lender. Notices of lodgement
and completion issue electronically and fees are paid electronically by variable
direct debit.282
A dealing number can be made available at an earlier stage in the transaction and
while this will confer no priority, it will facilitate collaboration based on a single
identiﬁer. There is also potential, in the future, for draft entries on the register to be
displayed prior to ﬁnalisation of the application for registration so the applicant can
be sure that the registration will accurately effect the agreed transaction. There is
also the possibility for further notiﬁcations to be built into the system which may
increase transparency and visibility for all parties.
The PRA have also provided a landdirect.ie service for members of the public
that allows for payment of the appropriate fee. This provides wider access and
transparency as citizens can directly access the title register online. Additional web
services have been implemented which allows for direct interaction between the
register and case management systems. Other electronic registration of title services
will be developed through the eRegistration portal in the coming years. The plan is
to include charges, transmissions and priority entries during 2014. Standard forms
of charge have already been introduced as of 1 March 2012 thus facilitating the
electronic registration of charges.283 These are one page forms speciﬁcally
designed to facilitate the introduction of eRegistration.284
The project board includes inter alia representatives from the Revenue Com-
missioners, Law Society, Irish Mortgage Council and the Companies Registration
Ofﬁce thus providing a broad base of engagement with consumers of land registry
data. The objective is to extend incrementally the range of applications which can
be registered without the presentation of paper documents.285 To date paper doc-
uments are still required for all transactions save those falling under the eDischarge
system and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. It should be noted however that
while a speciﬁc paper discharge may not be required in each transaction those
lenders who sign up to the eDischarge system are required to execute formal one off
documentation. This still needs to be printed, signed with a wet or manuscript
signature and sign up to the service will only proceed based on this initial paper
application to the registry.

eGovernment initiatives.286 This service along with other PRA eRegistration ini-
tiatives have won numerous awards.287 Kostova points out that no award is in itself
a guarantee of a successful operation but that take up of the system is impressive.288
The PRA itself notes that the continued development of eRegistration services in
consultation with its main stakeholders is fundamental to any future system of
eConveyancing in Ireland.289 It is to be hoped that Ireland’s eConveyancing project
will be one of its successes and the progress of eRegistration to date augurs well for
the success of a wider eConveyancing project.
eConveyancing
eRegistration is seen by the registration authority:
as a distinct subset of activities but also as a critical element within the wider
eConveyancing process....[thus] all plans and activities arising from the eRegistration
project are carefully designed to advance, complement and integrate with the wider
national eConveyancing agenda.290
Thus while the PRA has not taken responsibility for the wider eConveyancing
project it is working with other stakeholder groups to advance that agenda. This
co-operation is vital so that eRegistration and eConveyancing do not conﬂict and
also much of eConveyancing is based on legislative reform that impacts on title
registration.
In tandem with these eRegistration developments some eConveyancing type
initiatives have also been implemented. One such initiative is the introduction of a
new streamlined procedure, called the QeD (Quick electronic Discharge), to pro-
vide a standardised approach for communications between lenders and solicitors.291
The Irish Institution of Surveyors has established an Inter-Professional Task Force
to look at property boundaries and how boundary information is reﬂected by state
bodies and this has provided an opportunity for stakeholder groups to collaborate on
reform proposals.292
While there have been no signiﬁcant eConveyancing advances there has been
much dialogue and debate about the path that Ireland should take and a clear vision
is emerging of how eConveyancing would operate in Ireland. The proposals put

forward by the Law Reform Commission and Law Society have been universally
supported by stakeholder groups and have formed a benchmark for reform.293
Thus to date eRecords and eApplication have been achieved in Ireland. Only a
limited eRegistration service is in operation but new initiatives are anticipated. No
speciﬁc eConveyancing advances have been launched though there is a mandate
and platform for reform agreed by the main stakeholder groups.
The governments Construction Strategy 2020 acknowledges that the steps to
eConveyancing will require the representatives of the legal profession, the banking
sector and the relevant statutory agencies to work together closely building on work
already completed on this issue under the aegis of the Law Society.294 It identiﬁes
the Department of Justice and Equality as the lead responsible body for reviewing
and reporting on the steps required to deliver a system of eConveyancing in Ireland,
including the resource implications and timeframes for delivery.295
3.4.2
eConveyancing in Ontario
Background
In 1968 the Ontario provincial government asked the Law Reform Commission to
study the land registration system and make recommendations.296 This examination
led to the publication of a report in 1971 that recommended sweeping reforms
including the conversion of unregistered titles (Registry records) to registered titles
(Land Titles), automation of records and electronic searching and registration.
While the government accepted the recommendations it was not until the late
1980s that the process of reform began. Murray notes that the Ontario government
decided “that the paper-based system of recording interests in land should be
automated and services needed to be delivered electronically.”297
This reform accelerated when:
in the early 1990’s the Ministry, in conjunction with a private sector consortium,
established Teranet. . .The Ministry owns the land registration data and develops the
business rules. Teranet owns and operates the electronic system.298
This partnership allowed the province to accelerate the computerisation of the
land registration system299 and thus deliver the ﬁrst eRegistration system in the
293 Law Society of Ireland (2008a) and The Law Reform Commission (2006).

world.300 To quote from a recent assessment of the Ontario system by
New Zealand:
[i]t can be argued that the public private partnership and subsequent contractual arrange-
ment have been a success. It enabled the development of a fully functioning electronic land
registration system by the late nineties. The land registration process is now virtually all
electronic, all records have been converted and there is an effective electronic land
registration system readily accessible to the property business and the citizen.301
Christensen refers to the Ontario system as an example of the reformist
approach302 where all dealings are required to be undertaken electronically, infor-
mation is prescribed rather than the forms and dealings are no longer in writing.
Ontario is on the cutting edge internationally303 in relation to eRegistration. It is
widely acknowledged to be the ﬁrst jurisdiction in the world to introduce full
electronic document registration.304 This includes the eRecords, eApplication and
eRegistration elements of eConveyancing.
Ontario moved quickly from eRecords directly to eRegistration and thus there
was no eApplication phase.
eRecords
The reform process started in the late 1980s with the automation of records i.e. the
eRecords phase of eConveyancing. Paper records were converted into electronic
information to be stored on databases so that all information relating to registered
titles would become electronically accessible.305
During this automation process unregistered titles were converted to registered
titles. The full automation of land registration records and the conversion process
was completed on 31 March 2011.306 Approximately 36,000 unregistered proper-
ties remain because it was determined that these titles could not be converted to
registered parcels due to planning act issues, description issues, easement and water
issues, conﬂicts of ownership and inability to establish owners or breaks in the
chain of title.307

eRegistration
The Ontario Ministry began by building POLARIS (the Province of Ontario Land
Registration Information System)308 with the objective of automating Ontario’s
land registration system. Following this automation the Ministry introduced elec-
tronic remote search facilities and then electronic registration of land title docu-
ments through software called Teraview. This eRegistration system was developed
by Teranet309 in conjunction with the Ministry. It was launched as a pilot project in
1999 and subsequently implemented gradually across the province on a county by
county basis. The ﬁrst electronic land registration took place on 25 January 1999 at
London in the County of Middlesex and in “less than ﬁve years, the majority of land
titles searches and land registrations. . .moved from an archaic paper-based records
system to the most sophisticated fully electronic registration system in the
world.”310
The land registration system is the responsibility of the Ministry and Teranet
under contract facilitates the delivery of this service through Teraview.311 The
system provides an automated land registration database and web based gateway
for registration.312 Users must be registered with Teranet in order to lodge dealings
electronically. The system allows for the creation and lodgement of registration
documents. Pertinent information is automatically populated from the POLARIS
database into the draft documents which are then shared electronically between the
lawyers. Once certiﬁed by the lawyer for each party with an electronic signature the
documents are lodged for registration.313
The documents are created in an electronic format and are also transmitted and
ﬁled electronically. “The result is an all-electronic, paperless system, where docu-
ments are created, submitted and maintained in electronic format.”314
Murray expresses the view that Ontario used:
existing legislative provisions to offer a better guarantee of title to consumers and users of
the land registration system. The automation of the paper records and the conversion of
Registry records [unregistered titles] to Land Titles [registered titles] set the stage for the
introduction of electronic registration.315
Thus title to land was moved from the deeds register to the title register prior to
electronic processes being introduced.316 However this did not apply universally

with some land being automated in POLARIS but not being converted to registered
title.317
Some commentators have taken issue with the beneﬁts of reform. Moore and
Globe are of the view that while the length of many searches has reduced POLARIS
has not reduced the legal complexity of the title search.318 Because POLARIS
contains titles from both registers
lawyers and title searchers are now confronted with more title search scenarios than ever
before, each with different legal requirements and administrative procedures. From a risk
management point of view, it is arguably more difﬁcult today than in the past for lawyers to
review the title search notes carefully.319
The LRRA and its Regulations and Orders set out the framework for the
eRegistration initiative.320 The LRRA Part 1 dealt with the modernisation of record
keeping and forms. For example a common form of transfer, charge and discharge
was introduced for both the unregistered and registered systems.321 Part II intro-
duced automation and part III introduced electronic registration. Together they
form the basis for a complete system of eRegistration.
Thus the ﬁrst phase of Ontario’s eConveyancing initiative was the automation of
land registration records (eRecords) and conversion of unregistered titles to regis-
tered titles. The second phase involved electronic remote search facilities and,
beginning in 1999, electronic registration of registered titles, both delivered through
the Teranet gateway software known as Teraview. This software provides access to
POLARIS and is administered and controlled by Teranet. The eRegistration system
is known as e-reg.
E-reg is described by Moore and Globe as:
a mandatory, fully electronic or paperless registration system that will allow documents in
electronic format with digital signature to be registered online from a remote location, such
as a lawyer’s ofﬁce, instead of actual attendance for closing and registration at a Registry
ofﬁce.322
In order to introduce e-reg some legislative changes were required. These
included the removal of the requirement that a document be in writing and
signed,323 authority for direct electronic transmission of documents to the regis-
tered titles database,324 the fact that the electronic document will prevail over a

323 Section 21 LRRA provides that an electronic document that deals with an interest in land is not
required to be in writing or to be signed by the parties thereto and has the same effect for all
purposes as a document that is in writing and is signed by the parties.

written document325 and the introduction of law statements326 which the registrar
may rely on thus replacing the need for evidence to be provided by the lawyer.327 It
is the information required in a document that is prescribed and not the form.328
Law statements are based on the principle of “tell me, don’t show me”. This
means that lawyers are authorised to conﬁrm certain facts without the need to
provide supporting evidence.329 Only lawyers can register transfers or charges
which include law statements and these account for the vast majority of such
registrations.330 This principle allows certain paper documents to be removed
from the process as the lawyer can conﬁrm that perhaps a certain enquiry was
made but the search result does not have to be submitted in hard copy.331 The
purpose of these statements is to reduce the amount of paper ﬁled in the registered
title system.332 However while this paper may have been removed from the
application to the registrar, it has not been removed from the process as all
compliance with law statements must be supported by evidence retained in the
ﬁle.333 This removes paper from the registry but may add to the lawyers costs.
“A Law Statement may only be made by a person who is entitled to practice law
in Ontario as a solicitor.”334 The system will only allow users with the proper
authority and an active Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC) number to sign a
document for completeness when these statements are included. The system
receives a daily ﬁle from the LSUC database and veriﬁes the lawyer is in good
standing. If the user is not, the system switches the user type to “non-lawyer” and
they are not able to sign a document containing law compliance statements,
including transfers. Authority can only be gained by purchasing a license from
Teranet and all users are authenticated. Applicants for a license must provide one
piece of photographic identiﬁcation or two pieces of non-photographic identiﬁca-
tion. Since 2008 users apply to Teranet for an account and if they meet the
requirements Teranet will provide search access only. If the ability to register is

330 These law statements could be seen as similar to the statement of title in Form 3 that a lawyer
may give in Ireland upon ﬁrst registration of a title.
331 Section 24 of the LRRA is the statutory basis for law statements. Under section 24(2) evidence
in an electronic format made in accordance with the section is deemed to comply with any
requirement under a statute to provide written evidence in the form of an afﬁdavit, declaration,
statement or other written evidence despite the fact that the evidence is not in writing or signed by
the parties required to provide the evidence.

required, users must additionally apply to the Ministry providing information about
their identity, ﬁnancial status and good character.335
Non lawyers may lodge documents but only those that do not require compliance
with a law statement. They may also do searches in the system however effectively
lawyers have a monopoly on conveyancing.
In practical terms authorised users of the system create and register documents
from their PC using Teraview.336 The system allows users to select the appropriate
document type from a list and through a series of prompts to create the document,
including all necessary statements. Some information, such as property description
and current owner, are pre-populated in the document from the title database. This
reduces the risk of errors in this information. When a document is sent for
registration the system automatically checks the information against the existing
automated record. Fields and statements are programmed into the system for each
document type and thus ensure that the requirements for electronic registration are
met. The system will check that all mandatory ﬁelds have been completed and that
inconsistent information is not provided.
There is however always the danger that unauthorised users gain access to the
system. The system will have no idea who is at the keyboard and will accept anyone
logged on with the required passwords. In Ontario each user is given a personalised
proﬁle, that can be stored on a diskette or USB device, that must be used to gain
access to the system. This requires the user to insert their password when logging
in. This identiﬁes the user to the system and records their identity for each
registration and each law statement. Thus Teranet can trace each registration and
statement to an individual.337
The registry report no real changes in the reporting of errors or applications to
the compensation fund noting that the pre-population of data into registration
documents has improved the quality of the data.338
Registry staff continue to review the documentation and complete the registra-
tion through the normal certiﬁcation process. This “two-step registration process
existed in the legislation prior to the introduction of electronic registration”339 and
has been maintained in the e-reg system. Thus the electronic registration is auto-
mated but not automatic. Registration of an instrument is only complete when the
entry is certiﬁed by the registrar.340 The ﬁrst step is the making of the application by
the user of the system and the second step is the authorisation of that application by
335 See http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/land_registration/content/ONT06_018594.
html.
336 See Donahue et al. (2003), pp. 335–336.
337 A lawyer is prohibited from allowing any other person to use his or his diskette or password.
The lawyer is also responsible for ensuring that any non-lawyers in their ofﬁce who have access do
not allow unauthorised persons access to the system via their diskettes. See rule 5.01 of the Law
Society of Upper Canada (2013).

the registry staff before any change is made to the register. There is no paper
lodged.
The system allows documents to be electronically shared by their creator with
other users for review, amendment or approval and all communications are
encrypted using Entrust technology.341 All documents are digitally signed but any
subsequent modiﬁcation invalidates the signature and the document must then be
signed again before registration.
Registration documents are prepared simply by inputting information into the
system and once each document is complete it can be digitally signed by the lawyer.
The system does not rely on the signatures of the parties to the transaction and
instead restricts use to authorised users so as to maintain the integrity of the system.
These users must get authority from their clients before they proceed with regis-
tration. This authority to the lawyer to do the electronic registration is given by way
of a direction342 which is a paper document that is physically signed with a wet
signature by the client.
The system was introduced in a phased manner both in terms of functionality and
geographical spread. Initially e-reg was introduced on an optional basis and after a
transitional period it became compulsory. It ensures that all lawyers can run their
real estate practices electronically. Murray takes the view that electronic registra-
tion has:
provided the users of the system with a more efﬁcient method of dealing with interests in
land. It has provided the Ministry with opportunities to streamline its operations. It has
increased security of the records and improved the data integrity.343
As 99 % of all applications for registration are now submitted electronically
there has been a reduction in manual registry staff input.344 Table 3.3 demonstrates
the growth in electronic applications and the corresponding drop in paper.345
Table 3.4 represents the same information in approximate percentages.
The number of system users346 demonstrates the same growth pattern as set out
in Table 3.5.347
On 18 June 2014 8,023 of these users were active lawyers in the system.348
As of November 2010 electronic registration has been mandatory in all 54 land
registry ofﬁces throughout Ontario.349 There is no doubt but that Ontario has

implemented a full eRegistration system however there is some debate as to
whether this system could be labeled eConveyancing.
eConveyancing
eConveyancing requires a number of elements as follows350:
(a) the application of information technology
(b) transmission of digital data
(c) move from paper to electronic system
(d) online portal or hub
(e) electronic communication network
(f) system to system exchange of data
(g) information only to be typed in once
(h) integration of technology into most or all of the conveyancing process from
pre-sale to post completion of the transaction
The elements from (a)–(g) are all features of the Ontario system so the only
question remains in relation to (h). Does the Ontario system electronify not just the
registration aspects of conveyancing but also the entire end to end process from
pre-sale to post completion? Though as noted earlier in the chapter some elements
are excluded such as the physical inspection and veriﬁcation of the client’s identity.
A major part of any conveyancing process is the searches that have to be done.
These include searches of the title register, deeds register, judgments, known in
Ontario as executions, and other registers to establish encumbrances on the title. In
Ontario most of this searching is done through the Teraview system. There is a
remote-access, online program for searching POLARIS and for searching writs of
execution. The system offers electronic data interchange, EFT for search and
registration costs and land transfer tax payments which is equivalent to the Irish
stamp duty.

Moore and Globe have set out the services available.351 These are:
1. automated title searching
2. writ searching
3. subsearching (this is a facility to update earlier search results)
4. creation of both draft and registerable documents
5. automatic electronic calculation and payment of land transfer taxes
6. communication between lawyers throughout the document production and
registration process
7. review, amendment and approval of draft documents by lawyers
8. electronic submission and registration of documents
9. transfer of funds for registration and land transfer tax fees
10. secure private communication network for authorised users
11. docket summary, Acknowledgement and Direction, document preparation,
registration and land transfer tax, and deposit account and activity reports, and
12. conﬁdentiality, security and an electronic audit trail traceable to the user.
Item 11 appears at ﬁrst glance to be a repetition of the earlier services but it also
includes access to standard documentation and also the printing of reports for the
client ﬁle.
This is an impressive list but in considering whether the system fulﬁls the
requirements for eConveyancing the following should be noted.
Firstly, there are a considerable number of searches that must be done outside the
system. Examples include bankruptcy, zoning, realty taxes and services.352
Secondly, the system does not facilitate electronic communication between all
the stakeholders in the conveyancing process. The primary authorised users are
lawyers and staff in the registering authority.
Thirdly, the purchase monies are not included as part of the electronic exchange.
Finally, and most importantly, the system does not include the contract stage.
Part of the reason for this is likely due to the fact that it is often the real estate broker
who gets this Agreement of Purchase and Sale signed by the parties. In other
jurisdictions this stage in the process is done by the lawyer. Donahue and his
colleagues353 note that these agreements are almost always prepared by real estate
agents.
Apparently, because it is printed, most people sign before consulting a lawyer and, in many
cases, without even reading it. The purchase or sale of a house is the biggest transaction
most people ever enter into, yet an amazing number blithely sign the agreement without
ever calling on their lawyer for advice.354
Thus Ontario has not made the offer to purchase electronic. This forms the
binding contract between the transferor and transferee. It has however been reduced

to a standard four pages. This is in line with other advances whereby the standard
transfer has been reduced to three pages and the standard charge to two pages.
The absence of the binding contract stage and electronic fund transfer of the
purchase monies means that the Ontario system is closer to eRegistration than
eConveyancing.
However, this is subject to legislative change. Currently there is a prohibition on
electronic contracts for interests in land contained in the Electronic Commerce Act
2000.355 This Act gives legal recognition to electronic documents but in section 31
(1) excludes documents, including agreements of purchase and sale, that create or
transfer interests in land and require registration to be effective against third parties.
There appears to be a contradiction between this and section 21 of the LRRA which
provides that an electronic document that creates, transfers or otherwise disposes of
an estate or interest in land is not required to be in writing or to be signed by the
parties and has the same effect for all purposes as a document that is in writing and
is signed by the parties. The Electronic Commerce Amendment Act 2013356 pro-
poses to amend this provision to remove the exemption and permit digital signature
on such agreements. If passed this has the potential to pave the way for Ontario to
move into eConveyancing.
Conclusion
At its most advanced eConveyancing is the integration of information tech-
nology into the entire conveyancing process including the contract stage,
transfer and registration. Thus each jurisdiction can be placed on a scale of
movement towards eConveyancing based on the extent to which it facilitates
system to system exchange of data without the necessity for paper documen-
tation. This scale ranges, at one end, from the basic system that can facilitate
electronic applications for registration followed by the paper (eApplication)
to the more complex systems that make electronic parts or all of the regis-
tration process (eRegistration) and ﬁnally those that make electronic the
entire conveyancing process (eConveyancing).
There is a broad range of different models and systems357 however each
jurisdiction has generally followed the same pattern of development;
eRecords, eApplication, then eRegistration and ﬁnally eConveyancing.
Phases of eRegistration have also tended to follow similar lines with the
discharge of mortgages introduced ﬁrst, followed by the creation of charges
and then transfers and other forms of registration.

It can be difﬁcult to grasp to what degree systems have evolved along this
continuum. In particular it can be difﬁcult to determine to what degree
systems are electronic systems of title registration as opposed to merely
being a system of electronic communication of dealings to the registry. For
example the system may only provide for scanned paper documents to be
transmitted. This was the view expressed by Harpum in relation to the Ontario
system as the rationale for England seeking to develop its own system of
eConveyancing from ﬁrst principles.358
While Ontario was the ﬁrst jurisdiction to introduce full electronic docu-
ment registration359 recently developments in other jurisdictions challenge
the perception that it is by far the most developed eConveyancing system in
the world. Even if it was accepted that Ontario has eConveyancing, rather
than just eRegistration, it is clear that some other jurisdictions are rapidly
catching up. In particular Australia’s PEXA system is rapidly gaining
momentum.360
Also as of November 2014 Scotland will have the potential to move to
eConveyancing with the implementation of the Land Registration etc. (Scot-
land) Act 2012361 which will enable electronic contracts (called e-mis-
sives).362 Part 10 of the Act amends the Requirements of Writing
(Scotland) Act 1995363 and e-enables all documents referred to in section 1
(2)(a) of that Act. The 1995 Act required a written document for the consti-
tution of a contract or unilateral obligation for the creation, transfer, variation
or extinction of an interest in land.
This will enable fully electronic conveyancing transactions. Rennie and
Brymer note however that the full effects of the change will not be harnessed
until a secure electronic document exchange facility is available and this is “a
natural progression for conveyancing and the sale/purchase of heritable
property generally.”364 The full effects of the change are also hindered in
other respects. Scotland does not have standard formats of common convey-
ancing documents and does not have a single standard missive for all trans-
actions. Despite these limitations Scotland may become the ﬁrst jurisdiction
to venture from eRegistration into eConveyancing.

Deﬁning Econveyancing

While England and Wales has given digital signatures the same legal
standing as those written with a pen in the Electronic Communications Act
2000,365 thus paving the way for eConveyancing, the registering authority has
taken the decision to only allow electronic applications based on scanned
images
of
original
paper
documents.
As
noted
earlier
the
wider
eConveyancing project has now stalled and it is not proposed to extend the
Electronic Document Registration Service (eDRS) to etransfers and echarges.
The main focus of eConveyancing initiatives to date have been on
eRecords, eApplication and eRegistration. There has been little attention
paid to the pre completion and non registration aspects of conveyancing
transactions and the contract stage has been entirely neglected.366 Despite
this
many
jurisdictions
freely
claim to
be
on
the
march
towards
eConveyancing. Connolly is of the view that “[w]hile several international
countries claim the success of their implementation of e-conveyancing sys-
tem (sic), the correct term of reference should be, in default of a pre-contract
process,. . .an “E-Registration” system.”367
There is no doubting that Ontario was the ﬁrst jurisdiction to introduce full
electronic document registration368 however commentators often cite it as the
most developed eConveyancing system in the world. This may be due to a
misunderstanding of the terminology and a lack of research that sets out clear
boundaries between eRegistration and eConveyancing.
When examined in detail it is clear that the Ontario e-reg system is one of
eRegistration and is missing some vital elements that would move it into the
realm of eConveyancing. This is also true of advances in other jurisdictions.
“For the time being, e-conveyancing solutions in most jurisdictions are closer
to e-registration than to end-to-end e-conveyancing.”369 Though the Ontario
system seems to be a major success and it is the widely considered to be the
most advanced.370 Forthcoming legislative reform may pave the way for it to
move further into the electronic realm and along the spectrum towards
eConveyancing.
Ireland appears to have embarked on the road to eConveyancing success-
fully371 with the modernisation of the law,372 extension of compulsory

registration373 and digitisation of registry information however it has some
way to go before it moves from eApplication fully into eRegistration. “The
successful operation of eDischarge, the ﬁrst instalment of eRegistration, and
the soaring numbers of users availing of the PRA’s online services should be
a source of encouragement for all stakeholders”.374
However in implementing eConveyancing we must not lose sight of the
purpose of conveyancing and that technology can be adapted to meet the
needs of different types of policies. Computers will not decide how the land
market should operate. It is the policy makers who design the system and who
have to balance risks and rewards, costs and efﬁciency that will dictate how
eConveyancing is to be implemented.
Conveyancing practice is no longer severable from technology. As with any new
technology, it is important to remember that technology is a tool, and that the
primary focus and value of the real estate transactions must remain the investigation
of all aspects of title and the acquisition and protection of property rights.375
The next chapter explores the property rights currently protected by
registration and in particular focuses on what rights and interests have been
deemed worthy of protection by policy makers in Ontario and Ireland. It also
looks at where changes have occurred as a result of the move towards
technology
and
anticipates
further
developments
in
implementing
eConveyancing.

Deﬁning Econveyancing

Chapter 4
Deﬁning Title Registration
4.1
What Is Land Registration?
Land registration is the system under which titles to land are recorded. As outlined
in Chap. 2 there are two basic divisions; deeds registration and title registration, and
these have co-existed in many jurisdictions for decades.1
Many researchers and commentators ascribe very lofty aims to land registration
systems. For example Manthorpe claims that “the essential purpose of land regis-
tration world-wide: [is] to promote the social stability and the economic well being
of all but especially the landless poor and disadvantaged.”2 Lawson and Rudden say
that “[r]egistration is a familiar device for preserving evidence and guaranteeing its
truth”.3 De Soto sees land registration as part of a process of capital formation and
points out the difﬁculties that arise when property rights are not formalised.4
The absence of an efﬁcient, trustworthy and transparent property rights infrastructure – and
thereby access to modern ﬁnancial services enjoyed by all citizens – constitutes one of the
most important obstacles for economic growth in developing and transition countries in
general.5
If the poor cannot participate in an expanding market because they do not have
access to a legal property rights system that would allow them to realise the value of
their assets then their assets are dead capital stuck in the extralegal sector.6
In order to turn land into capital owners need a formal system that provides a
representation of their ownership which can be easily combined, divided, mobilised

and used to stimulate business deals.7 This formal representational system allows
“the fully capitalized assets to enjoy a multiple existence; namely, a physical
existence, a legal existence, an economic existence, a political existence, and so
forth.”8 In practical terms it could be said that while conveyancing deals with the
passing of the asset (land, estates, interests or title to land) from one person or entity
to another, land registration is the system that represents the same asset on a formal
record. Any change in ownership of the asset through a conveyancing transaction
will be reﬂected by a change in the record. This formal record can be used for
multiple purposes and in a multitude of ways.
Zaibert and Smith have identiﬁed some of these ways.9 For example land has a
physical existence as it can be dug up, ploughed and planted. In terms of its legal
existence it can be sold, sub divided or mortgaged. In its economic existence it can
be leased or be the subject for payment of a grant or subsidy. It can have a political
existence in that the franchise may be conﬁned to land owners. Zaibert and Smith
refer to it as being fully capitalized indicating the commercial nature of land as an
asset.10 As it can be mortgaged its value can be realised and translated into cash.
This is an important feature of land which can only be fully utilised in an effective
land registration system.
The key features of land registration systems are set out clearly in the Inventory
of Land Administration Systems in Europe and North America produced by the
English Land Registry on behalf of the UNECE WPLA.11 This inventory includes
information from 50 separate jurisdictions including Ireland and Canada. 100 % of
respondents had land ownership and legal rights recorded on the land register. 90 %
had mortgages and secured loans on the register and displayed the land purchase
price. 85 % of land registers were backed by state guarantee, 86 % were wholly or
partly computerised and 81 % had a system to protect priority of registrations.
Land registration often sits alongside a cadastre.12 This is the ofﬁcial record that
enables the boundaries of land properties to be reliably located.13 Together cadastre
and land registration can be deﬁned as the land administration system (LAS).14

system, good land policy and a legal framework must be in place to underpin a thriving and

Deﬁning Title Registration

Another related term is land management which is the process of managing the use
and development of land resources.15 Sometimes the terms ‘land administration’
and ‘cadastral system’ are used interchangeably however this does not reﬂect the
complexity of the position in many countries. Alternatively the term ‘cadastre’ is
sometimes used to also include land registration.
Stubkjaer notes that this deﬁnition rather reﬂects the situation in Anglo-
American countries and he notes that in continental Europe cadastre and
legal land registers were born separately.16 He goes on, however, to suggest that
“[r]ecent deﬁnitions show an agreement on the concept of a cadastral system,
namely the combination of a cadastre – with its spatial focus – and a land register
– with its legal focus”17 and he credits this development to Silva and Stubkjaer.18
The confusion arises because in some countries the cadastre ofﬁce may maintain
the title and/or deeds register19 and in others this is a separate body.20 In many parts
of Europe, the cadastre evolved as a support for land taxation, while land registra-
tion was dealt with separately by lawyers. This resulted in dual systems.
The cadastre which exists in Norway and many other west-European countries,
once under the command of Napoleon, generally deals with mapping, land use and
land values for taxation.21 In other countries these tasks often fall within the remit of
local authorities or may be split into several registers, each maintained by different
entities. “Basically cadastral tasks are associated with the creation, maintenance and
dissemination of data about real property units, while registration undertakes the
responsibility to record, make known and guarantee property rights”.22
Silva and Stubkjaer do acknowledge that the terms ‘cadastre’ and ‘cadastral
system’ are “unsatisfactorily close”23 and they relate this to the different conceptua-
lisations of the cadastral institution in countries with different administrative
traditions. They explain that no satisfactory alternatives have been found.24
However adopting this overarching term ‘cadastral system’ as also including
land registration does not ﬁt neatly with those jurisdictions that do not have a
cadastre. The basis for a cadastre is usually ground surveys25 however the mapping
in some jurisdictions does not provide a similar level of detail.

4.1
What Is Land Registration?
117

Prendergast et al. note that in Ireland “[l]arge scale topographic maps from
Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) were used to record property boundaries rather than
creating a cadastre.”26 They make the distinction between the (non-conclusive)
general boundary system in Ireland and the ﬁxed boundary system available from a
cadastre “which is supported with measurements, descriptions and coordinates of
markers, which deﬁne boundaries on the ground”.27
Thus in jurisdictions such as Ireland Fig. 4.1 provides a more accurate way of
classifying the arrangement between land registration and mapping.
This is however subject to change with the proposal to merge the PRA, OSi and
the Valuation Ofﬁce.28 Deeney refers to the fact that such a fully integrated land,
property and spatial information services organisation would provide “an opportu-
nity for more efﬁcient and cost-effective delivery of land, spatial data and property
administration services.”29

Registry has rejected this move as being unnecessary as it would add little to the title registration
system and may not be justiﬁed on cost grounds. See Deeney et al. (2011), pp. 34–37 and 36–39.

Deﬁning Title Registration

Often the title registration element is further categorised under headings such as
European, Torrens and English.30 Much debate arises as to where particular juris-
dictions fall within these categories31 and what exactly determines how a system
should be classiﬁed. Cooke and O’Connor classify the Irish and Ontario systems
together as being modeled on the English system.32 It may be that these distinctions
are becoming blurred with the advance of globalisation, the integration of systems
through computerisation and the development of more modern land information
systems and processes. However there will always be a need for clarity in
categorising and classifying systems in order to provide a ﬁrm basis for
benchmarking and comparability.
One method of categorising and classifying is according to what type of title
registration is in operation. This will regulate not just what can be owned but to
what extent that ownership is protected by the state.
4.2
What Is Title Registration?
Some commentators use alternative, and in some instances confusing, terminology
to mark the division between deeds registration and title registration. For example
Miceli refers to the title registration system as the Torrens system and the deeds
registration system as the recording title system.33 He, along with many commen-
tators, marks the division on the basis of the role of government in guaranteeing
land title. Moore and Globe also refer to Ontario’s registered title system (called
Land Titles) as a form of “Torrens” or government guaranteed land registration
system.34
30 Cooke (2004) divides title registration systems into three main families; Torrens, English and
German. O’Connor suggests that it would not be surprising if the English and Torrens systems
were the offspring of a common but unacknowledged German parent. See O’Connor
(2003b), p. 98.
31 Ruoff and his colleagues believe Torrens titles are inﬁnitely simpler than English titles as the
latter are freely rectiﬁable but Torrens titles are “so relatively sacrosanct that, save, to some
degree, for fraud, duress and illegality, even the highest courts in Australia have claimed no more
than a half-hearted jurisdiction over them. And yet, strangely enough, the Torrens system produces
far more litigation than the English system.” See Ruoff et al. (1986), p. 13. See also Cooke
(2003b), p. 100.
32 Noting that the Ontario Land Titles Act is based on the English Land Transfer Act of 1875 but
pointing out that it is not easy to state the essential points of difference between the Torrens and
English systems. See Cooke and O’Connor (2004), p. 643. For Murphy the distinction is that the
Torrens system has conclusive state guaranteed boundaries but in the English system the bound-
aries are not conclusive. See Murphy (2013), p. 52. Lyall is of the view that the Irish system is
basically the same as the English system but has some features typical of the Torrens system. See
Lyall (2010), p. 931.

What Is Title Registration?

In a deeds registration system only the existence of the deed is registered and not
the ownership or title. Whereas in a title registration system the ownership or title is
registered. Under the deeds registration system the title must be investigated de
novo every time the property is transferred whereas in the title registration system
only the authentication of the transferor’s title need be investigated as the accuracy
of the register and thus the title is guaranteed.
This is important for the authentication of a transferor’s title which can be
investigated through a title search against the register. No further enquires may
be required as the accuracy of the register and the guarantee of the title will protect a
transferee. This guarantee of the title based on the register leads to a concern about
giving power to amend or change the register to anyone other than the registrar.
Other commentators refer to positive and negative systems of land registration.35
In a negative system registration does not confer or guarantee the title. This is the
system of deeds registration. In contrast title registration is a positive system of land
registration in that it may confer or guarantee the title or both. This may however be
subject to rectiﬁcation. Thus in a positive system “even an unauthorised registration
is legally effective to create or terminate an interest, unless and until the register is
rectiﬁed to restore title to the person previously entitled.”36 A void title will in fact
become voidable and the validity or otherwise of the underlying title will be ignored
unless challenged as the fact of registration will take precedence.
Cooke also makes the distinction between bijuralism and monojuralism. “While
a negative system operates within the normal rules of property law (because a void
transfer does not confer ownership even if registered), and is thus monojural, a
positive system superimposes its own rules, and can be called bijural.”37 In the case
of a forged transfer from A to B, A will remain the owner in a negative system
however, in a positive system B will remain the owner “although according to the
ordinary rules of property law A ought to be.”38 Such is the importance of
registration. This is explored further in Chap. 7.
The Torrens system of title registration developed and implemented by Robert
Torrens was introduced ﬁrst in Australia by the Real Property Act 1858 (SA). This
system was quickly adopted in Western Canada39 and many other countries.40 It is
often seen as being similar, if not identical, to the systems of title registration in
operation in other common law countries. However on an examination of the
individual systems differences can be distinguished.
Bradbrook et al.41 argue that the Australian system has fundamental differences
from British real property law. “The [Australian] system is one where title to land is

Deﬁning Title Registration

derived from registration – it is a system of title by registration and not one of
registration of title.”42 A title by registration system means that entry on the land or
title register is required before the estate or interest is created. The act of recording
the ownership on the register creates the interest. Thus a party must apply for this
registration before they have legal title. Whereas registration of title is merely that,
registration of title that already exists.
In Ireland the legal effect of non-registration where registration is compulsory43
is set out in section 25 of the 1964 Act.44 All such conveyances and assignments
must be registered within 6 months, or such later date as the registrar, or, in the case
of its refusal, the court may allow. If such conveyance, grant or assignment is not
registered, no title vests in the party holding under such a conveyance or assign-
ment. The section provides that the person shall not acquire the estate or interest
purported to be conveyed, granted or assigned. On registration the title relates back
to the date of execution of the conveyance, grant or assignment and any dealings
with the land before the registration have effect accordingly.
Section 51(2) is the corresponding provision for land already registered. It
provides that until a transferee is registered as owner of the land transferred, that
instrument shall not operate to transfer the land. There is however no 6 month time
limit. Thus the transfer does not vest title in the transferee. It only confers, as
against the transferor, an equity to be registered though the entire beneﬁcial interest
passed with the signing of the contract. A purchaser of registered land will only
have an equitable interest in the land until registration occurs45 even though they
have parted with the purchase monies and the transaction is completed. Thus
Ireland operates a title by registration system. There are no comparable provisions
in Ontario which operates a registration of title system.
There is an argument that title by registration puts the purchaser in a worse
position for a period of time than a purchaser of an unregistered interest as that
purchaser gets the legal estate with delivery of the deed. The protection given that
legal estate is not as great as that conferred by registration but it is conferred
immediately on completion.46 In advance of registration of a registered title a
purchaser only has an equitable interest. Thus the registering authority grants
legal title. It is the fact of registration that gives title and nothing else. By contrast
in a registration of title system the registering authority records the title that is
already granted by a land owner and guarantees that title.

46 Torrens apparently failed to consider how the race system would apply in a two-stage land
transaction where the contract and completion represent two distinct stages separated by a time
interval. See O’Connor (2003a), p. 261. She describes the race system of registration as one where
priority is awarded to the interest-holder that wins the race to the register; see p. 254.
4.2
What Is Title Registration?
121

Again many commentators use different terminology to distinguish between
systems that require title by registration and those that offer registration of title.
For example Estonia has a system of title by registration referred to as a “title based
electronic register. The right has to be entered in the land register in order to be
valid.”47 Regardless of the terminology used and the points of difference identiﬁed
the term title registration is used here to identify those systems that have two
fundamental characteristics. Firstly the title is registered and not the deed as in a
deeds register, regardless of whether registration is required for the interest to be
created, and secondly the register is guaranteed by the state.
It is interesting to note that despite the lofty aims of Robert Torrens all title
registration systems have been diluted to a greater or lesser extent. “Establishing a
trusted land register remains as the compelling yet elusive priority”.48 Locke points
out that while:
the Torrens system was designed and introduced to simplify and streamline the process of
buying and selling land. . .. over time, the introduction of different pieces of
legislation. . .has effectively unbundled information about the range of rights, obligations
and restrictions. . .which attach to land.49
Legislation about matters such as planning, family situation and tax requires
transferees to search multiple registers and systems held by numerous authorities
and agencies and this “increases the chance of pertinent information being inad-
vertently missed, overlooked or incorrectly disregarded.”50 Frank argues that land
registration is burdened by legal procedural connections to multiple tax laws,
planning laws, family law, social laws and law about agrarian reform and he
makes a case for simple laws.51 This aspect of title registration is examined further
in Chap. 8.
No jurisdiction has, it appears, attempted to devise a true paperless
eConveyancing system except in respect of registered land.52 Wylie says that the
reason is clear. While it may be possible to capture information held by public
bodies, including the Land Registry, on computer databases it is difﬁcult to see how
this could be done in relation to title deeds for unregistered land held by private land
owners and lending institutions. The “logistics of such an exercise would seem to be
insurmountable and the costs involved barely worth thinking about, never mind
considering who should bear them.”53

Deﬁning Title Registration

In Ontario it was felt that maintaining two separate land registration systems
created costly public and private resource duplication and a legal complexity that
increased the risk of error.54 Land registration reform aimed to convert to one
registered title system and to integrate fully all land related information and
databases into one centralised, automated, online land information system.55
Thus the development of eConveyancing can provide an impetus for deeds
registers to be closed down,56 title registers to be extended and also for a move
towards title by registration. In addition to extending the title register to incorporate
all land in the State, with the consequent closing of the deeds register, the emphasis
of registration changes. Wylie notes that instead of a:
registration of title system, where the process of registration is viewed largely as an attempt
to reﬂect the title or ownership as it would exist in unregistered land, we would increasingly
have a system of title by registration, where it is the act of registration which confers the
title or ownership.57
Gray and Gray refer to the changing nature of modern title which marks the
transition from a world in which title originates in physical possession towards a
different world in which the source of title is an administrative act of registration.58
The extension of the title register does not just relate to geographical area. It may
also mean the extension of registration to encompass interests which were previ-
ously kept off the register. This approach has been endorsed by the Law Society of
Ireland59 and it is explored further in Chap. 8.
4.3
Why Title Registration?
Title registration is seen as being an important tool in the development of land
markets and the growth of economic wealth.60
The State guaranteed system of title to property, as administered by the Land Registry, is an
invaluable instrument for the protection of rights and interests in property and makes
possible the numerous ﬁnancial transactions which are the hallmark of a thriving, modern
market economy.61

4.3
Why Title Registration?
123

In Ireland the value of housing alone indemniﬁed under the registration of title
system has been estimated to exceed €500 billion, with well over €80 billion worth
of mortgages registered.62 Property transactions are a key driver of wealth and
property is a popular investment vehicle and thus generates substantial wealth.
The efﬁciency, transparency and justice of how these transactions are conducted
is a fundamental consideration that effects the level of activity in the marketplace.
In order for land-related ﬁnancial activity to be sustained the title registration
system must provide transparency of ownership and security of title. De Soto points
out that where real ownership of assets exists outside the ofﬁcial registry system the
result is that:
people’s resources are commercially and ﬁnancially invisible. Nobody really knows who
owns what and where, who is accountable for the performance of obligations, who is
responsible for losses and fraud, and what mechanisms are available to enforce payment for
services and goods delivered.63
In effect there is no transparency. Title registration is seen as an effective means
of providing this transparency which facilitates investment in land.
The United Nations has recognised the social and economic beneﬁts of good
land administration.64 The World Bank has ﬁnanced more than 30 land adminis-
tration projects in the Europe and Central Asia region.65 The reason for this
investment is because throughout the region “insecure and uncertain property rights
have been and in many countries continue to be a barrier to investment and a
constraint on economic development.”66
Barriers preventing such investment are seen as being negative. In the context of
Ireland, Clancy has asserted that “[b]arriers to trading in land are excessive relative
to other areas of investment and this discourages investment in property to the
detriment of economic activity and tax receipts.”67 Although it is only one source of
impediment the transactions costs of dealing in land are seen to be relatively high
and legal costs are often seen as a signiﬁcant part of these transaction costs. Title
registration offers a potential lowering of legal costs and the possibility for a
stronger and more certain title that can provide security to investors.
Though the barriers may be there for very good reasons. Barriers may arise as
land is a ﬁnite and scarce resource and an important source of wealth. Onerous
legislative provisions may be a means to protect the social value of home owner-
ship, to collect tax or to protect against unfair bargain or oppressive use of remedies.
Registration ensures certainty of title and ownership and provides the guarantee that

underpins the considerable ﬁnancial investment involved in purchasing property.
Given this perspective, of course it is going to be onerous and expensive.
Wallace and Williamson set out ﬁve land market stages in the move towards
wealth acceleration.68 They are
1. Land
2. Land Rights
3. Land Trading
4. Land Market
5. Complex Commodities Market
Stage 5 features dynamic trading in complex commodities, secondary
securitisation and corporatisation of land ownership which gives a multiplier effect
leading to wealth acceleration and a mature property market. They are of the view
that the land administration system must be ﬂexible enough to accommodate stage
5 and the fact that these complex commodities will not necessarily be physical
objects. However the development of such complex ﬁnancial instruments that few
understood has been identiﬁed as one of the features of inadequate regulation of the
real estate and ﬁnancial markets that led to the current global ﬁnancial crisis.69
Rapaczynski gives the example of the more “propertied classes” of modern
America where:
the intangibles become ever more prevalent and ever more esoteric: patents, futures,
ﬁnancial derivatives, tax shelters, mortgage-backed securities, junk bonds and instruments
that only a few wizards understand. The problem with most of these sophisticated forms of
property is that the law of even the most powerful, rational and benevolent states cannot
fully deﬁne or protect them.70
A complex commodities market is often referred to as ‘sweating’ the assets. The
principle is that the asset (title to land) can be used as security for a loan that can be
traded in the lending market. Thus title to land can be used by the land owner to
raise cash for investment and wealth generation. The lender in advancing the loan
funds can make interest on the loan but can also repackage the loan and sell its title
or interest on to another investor. From this perspective dynamic security will be
dominant so as to encourage new loans on property.
Dynamic security facilitates exchange by reducing or eliminating the risk that
the transferees’s title and the lender’s interest will be subject to unknown prior
claims and title defects. It is suggested that this lowers transaction costs by limiting
the enquiries that need to be made. The shift from static to dynamic security is

reﬂected in the move towards market capitalism and the trade of land for its
economic value rather than its use.71
4.4
Dynamic Versus Static Security
The principle of dynamic security provides that the transferee’s title and right will
be protected where there is a conﬂict between that interest and the title of the
transferor. Thus even where the transfer occurred due to fraud, force or deceit and
there is an innocent transferor title will still pass to the transferee. The innocent
transferor will not be able to recover his prior title as there will be no rectiﬁcation of
the register but instead may be able to claim compensation.
In our schematic this would have the effect of removing the risk to some
participants but not others. A and X would lose their title as there will be no
rectiﬁcation and they will have to rely on claiming compensation from the regis-
tering authority or from the party who did the wrongful act. However as the register
is upheld there would be no risk to B, Y or C. They would have their title and right
protected. This is explored further in Chap. 7.
Thus
a good faith third party for value acquires a property right if the purchase is based on the
information provided by the register. If the seller’s right is later shown to be defective, the
buyer keeps the property right and the original owner gets contract rights against the seller
and the register.72
Static security is the opposing principle. Static security will allow rectiﬁcation of
the register whenever it’s fair. Static security will preserve the existing allocation of
property rights. It determines that owners should not be deprived of their rights by
the act of another without their consent. The register would be rectiﬁed to protect
the interest of the transferor in the event that the transaction was based on force,
fraud or deceit. In our schematic this would remove the risk to the transferor
A. Instead the risk is passed to B, Y and C. B, Y can C would lose their title
however they may be able to claim compensation from the registering authority or
from the party who did the wrongful act. The title held by one party is upheld at the
expense of another party.
Third parties and property claimants who claim against the property rights of the
transferor also value static security as their claim may disappear as a result of a
transfer. Dynamic security may have the effect of causing a transfer to destroy their
rights. The transaction itself may be the event that destroys or damages their right
71 This dichotomy reﬂects the many uses of land; as a physical space, for food and shelter, as an
economic resource, to create rights and obligations, as an expression of cultural heritage or to
generate a land market. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (2004), pp. 1–2
sets out some of these perspectives.

thus protecting the dynamic property rights of the transferee. The destructive effects
of a registered transaction are explored in Chap. 8.
Transferors value static security more and dynamic security less. Transferees
value dynamic security more and static security less. The prior lender with an
undischarged charge will also value static security but the acquisition lender will
value dynamic security.
This conﬂict can be expressed as a dispute between the principles of certainty
and fairness or ﬂexibility of the register. Certainty of the register will beneﬁt
transferees and acquisition lenders. This may be at the expense of the transferor
who is blameless but is now being offered a sum of money instead of title to his
home as if they were “perfect substitutes”.73 This conﬂict between certainty and
ﬂexibility of the register is explored further in Chap. 8.
O’Connor notes that both static and dynamic security are:
essential to the enterprise of land title registration. For land assets to be used productively,
existing owners must be sure that they will not be deprived of the property without their
consent. Without static security, there would be little incentive to invest in improving land
or bringing it into production. [In the alternative] [p]urchasers need to be sure that the law
will uphold their reasonable expectations that they are acquiring a sound title free of hidden
claims. If they are to invest in the productive use of land, they need to be sure that no
challenger will step forward in the future to assert a prior claim. Long after acquisition,
purchasers and owners continue to require dynamic security. The dilemma for the law is
that it is sometimes impossible to provide both forms of security when the rights of a prior
owner conﬂict with those of a good faith purchaser.74
As there is only one property “[t]he law must provide an adjudication rule to
determine which of the two innocent parties gets the disputed property interest....
The law must create a winner and a loser.”75 This dilemma is referred to by
O’Connor as “perhaps the most vexed legal problem in land title registration
systems.”76
While transferees are more interested in dynamic security, once they have
acquired registered title they are then less supportive of dynamic security and
more keen on static security. As a transferee they wish to promote ease of transfer
but as a registered owner they are more interested in maintaining the security of
their title.
A system that provides for no rectiﬁcation of the register under any circum-
stances favours dynamic security. Under this principle “[r]egistration of title is
designed to protect purchasers rather than owners.”77 This does not include owners
of third party property rights or property claimants as only new owners or trans-
ferees are protected.

4.4
Dynamic Versus Static Security
127

Dynamic security is often referred to as indefeasibility.78 This principle of
indefeasibility is frequently advanced to justify the upholding of the register. If a
mistake is made then compensation, and not rectiﬁcation, will be the remedy for
those deprived of their interest in land.
A distinction may be made between immediate and deferred indefeasibility.79
Immediate indefeasibility provides that a transferee is protected from any defect or
problem with the title or transaction and no rectiﬁcation will take place subsequent
to the transaction. The transferee must have acted without fraud and given valuable
consideration for the transfer. Deferred indefeasibility means that the transferee is
not protected from a defect or problem but if that transferee sells on then the
subsequent purchaser is protected.80 The operation of the positive system is
deferred until the next register entry.81
With deferred indefeasibility a title obtained fraudulently can be defeated until it
is perfected by the sale to a subsequent bona ﬁde purchaser for value. With
immediate indefeasibility registration immediately validates a transfer even if it is
forged or otherwise is void or voidable. Both, to different degrees, offend the nemo
dat principle of property law.82
With immediate indefeasibility the innocent transferee becomes the registered
owner even if the transfer was made fraudulently. Deferred indefeasibility provides
that the innocent transferee will not be protected in this circumstance but any
innocent other part who deals with that transferee will be protected. This would
include a subsequent transferee and may include the lender. Immediate indefeasi-
bility is a manifestation of dynamic security while deferred indefeasibility seeks to
balance dynamic and static security. “The compromise is that static security is not
affected by the registration of a forged instrument, but yields to dynamic security
only when a supervening purchaser transacts in reliance on the registration.”83
O’Connor notes the tendency of the terms to confuse as the term deferred
indefeasibility “directs attention to a subsequent register entry, whereas the
78 The particular legislative sections that provide for indefeasibility are often called “para-
mountcy” provisions. See the use of this term in Cooke and O’Connor (2004), p. 645.
79 Mason (2003), p. 5. Mason notes the criticism of immediate indefeasibility is that it is too rigid
and deferred or even discretionary indefeasibility might deliver fairer results. See p. 17. O’Connor
notes that it was in Australia and New Zealand that the debate over deferred and immediate
indefeasibility ﬁrst erupted. See O’Connor (2009a), p. 199 with the case of Frazer v. Walker
[1967] 1 AC 569 giving the ﬁrst unequivocal endorsement of immediate indefeasibility. For details
of the position prior to this case and its applicability in the Canadian context at that time see Neave
(1976), pp. 173–192.
80 Cooke provides a more simplistic deﬁnition of indefeasibility in stating that in England it takes
the form of a guarantee of indemnity when title is upset, rather than any principle that registered
title is unassailable. See Cooke (2003a), p. 281.

Deﬁning Title Registration

difference between the two positions actually relates to the effect of the registered
interest that results “immediately” from the forgery.”84
“Indefeasibility confers registered titles with immunity from attack but a degree
of ambiguity arises in relation to the origin of the attack.”85 Woods notes that some
view the principle as preventing the defeasance of a registered title by unregistered
rights arising subsequent to registration (the prohibition or veto rule) while others
view the principle as only operating to protect a registered owner from unregistered
rights arising prior to registration (the refresh rule).86 “[F]or some it performs a
continuing prospective protective function in relation to the registered owner while
for others the principle performs a retrospective cleansing of the title for purchasers
who rely on the register.”87
So indefeasibility can apply in different ways. It can provide retrospective
cleansing of the title and thus protect from rights arising prior to ﬁrst registration.
What Woods calls the refresh rule means that
registration cleanses the title allowing a purchaser to rely on the register as conclusive
evidence of ownership and a shield against any prior claims. The static security of the
owners of interests which are not reﬂected on the register must be sacriﬁced in order to
simplify the investigation of title and promote the dynamic security of purchasers and the
marketability of land.88
Indefeasibility can also provide a continuing prospective function to protect
from unregistered rights arising subsequent to registration. This is the prohibition
or veto rule referred to above.
Thus the type of indefeasibility sets out the extent of the protection or immunity
from attack afforded by registration. Indefeasibility “measures the security of title
that registration confers.”89 It can be
(a) immediate; or
(b) deferred; and it can
(c) protect from rights arising prior to ﬁrst registration; and/or
(d) protect from unregistered rights arising after ﬁrst registration; and
(e) be absolute; or
(f) qualiﬁed.90

and presumptive as giving the court discretion to vary the rule in circumstances where it would
cause hardship. Other commentators have referred to the latter as discretionary indefeasibility. See
Mason (2003).
4.4
Dynamic Versus Static Security
129

How the system is classiﬁed under these headings will determine who is at risk
from an error in the register, whose interest is protected and who gets compensation
instead.91
Torrens registration systems are strong on dynamic and weak on static security
and some favour immediate indefeasibility.92 This principle has been the subject of
vast literature and much litigation in Torrens registration systems but has attracted
less notice and provoked very few cases in England93 and Ireland. In particular it
has been much debated and litigated in Australia and New Zealand both of which
favour immediate indefeasibility.94
In England and Wales the principle of qualiﬁed indefeasibility was adopted in
the Land Registration Act 2002. Harpum describes this principle as follows:
[i]f there is a mistake in the register, a person affected by that mistake can seek to have the
register altered to correct that mistake. However, where the correction of that mistake
prejudicially affects the title of a registered proprietor who is, or is deemed to be in physical
possession of the land in question, the register will not be rectiﬁed against him or her unless
he/she has caused or substantially contributed to the mistake by fraud or lack of proper care
or it would for some other reason be unjust for the alteration not to be made. . .A wide range
of proprietors are treated as being in physical possession of land. If, in such circumstances,
the register is not rectiﬁed, the party suffering loss as a result of the mistaken registration is
entitled to the payment of an indemnity from the Registry.95
This Act also provides that if a person is registered as proprietor of a legal estate
in circumstances where that legal estate would not otherwise have been vested in
him, it is deemed to be vested in him as a result of the registration. Harpum stated
that if “therefore, the transfer to him/her was a forgery, the transferee is, nonethe-
less, the registered proprietor of the legal estate.”96 Thus the principle of qualiﬁed
indefeasibility is intended to provide safeguards to the transferee. It does not
provide any safeguard to the land owner who was registered before forgery shifted
the ownership.
Griggs argues that immediate indefeasibility in the Torrens system maximises
the welfare of society as a whole, but in individual cases, effects a grievous injustice
upon the ‘formal’ legal owner: that being the loss of the property.97 This ‘formal’
legal owner presumably being the person who would be entitled if it were not for
the error in the register, rather than the person actually registered in error. Which is
the ‘true’ or ‘formal’ legal owner? It would be more accurate to refer to the
displaced owner, whose ownership is displaced by the error, or the innocent prior
registered owner.

Deﬁning Title Registration

She refers to this as a liability based solution in that the property interest is not
paramount, the right of the ‘formal’ legal owner can be infringed but that it is
ultimately cheaper to allow that infringement and pay compensation (i.e. accept the
liability), rather than enforce the proprietary rights of the formal legal owner.98
Thus certainty of title (the joint welfare maximising solution) is valued more highly
than the protection of the individual property interest. The system permits the
infringement to occur and the interest of the ‘formal’ legal owner to be
extinguished.99 This enhances the marketability of land and provides an impetus
to use land for investment. Thus dynamic security provides an incentive to acquire
assets as it will protect transferees so that they acquire title free from unknown
claims and defects. For this reason dynamic security is also known as market
security.
O’Connor cites Ontario as an example of the evaporation of public acceptance of
immediate indefeasibility where the rule was perceived as contributing to a rising
incidence of losses through identity fraud.100 She explores the position in Australia
referring to changes in the mortgage lending industry as unleashing the moral
hazard inherent in immediate indefeasibility.101 This is a reference to immediately
indefeasibility shifting fraud risk to a person external to the loan transaction thus
relieving the lender from the necessity to ensure they are dealing with the land
owner and to carry out identity checks.102
“In a world where information is not perfect, we can protect a later owner’s
interest fully, or we can protect the earlier owner’s interest fully. But we cannot do
both.”103 If an error arises then there are a number of responses to it. The system
may provide that if registration ignores or contradicts what would have been your
property right then your right is gone but you are entitled to compensation. Or
alternatively the register may be rectiﬁed to correct the error and thus your right is
protected. If static security takes priority over dynamic security then the register
will be rectiﬁed whenever it is fair. The continual tension between these claims and
the rights of land owners is reﬂected in every conveyancing transaction.
O’Connor explains
98 Griggs (2001).
99 Griggs makes reference to the Tragedy of the Commons and the Prisoners’ Dilemma, two
perspectives that demonstrate the conﬂict between a joint welfare maximising solution (commu-
nity welfare) and the maximisation of individual welfare. See Griggs (2001). Both individual
welfare and community welfare is highest if co-operation can be enforced. The selﬁsh behaviour of
individuals erodes everyone’s welfare.

fraud.
101 O’Connor (2009b), p. 158. Moral hazard is referred to at p. 133 as the tendency of a party to
take less care to avoid a loss-producing event if the loss is borne by someone else. See also Griggs
and Low (2011), p. 291.

4.4
Dynamic Versus Static Security
131

[i]n this terminology there is “static” security to the extent that the law prevents deprivation
of property other than by consensual transfer, and there is “dynamic” security (or security
of transaction) to the extent that the law upholds the expectation that bona ﬁde purchasers
will acquire a good title to an asset, free of unknown claims. Static security allows assets to
be securely held, while dynamic security allows assets to pass securely to new owners. The
dilemma is that while both conceptions of security are desirable, they are to some extent
antithetical. Rules that promote static security tend to derogate from dynamic security and
vice versa.104
Registration will thus protect but may also restrict property rights. It may add to
the transaction cost and the drive towards registration of interests may enhance
dynamic security as registration will protect one class of interests at the expense of
others.
Lawson and Rudden express this conﬂict as one between different elements of
the community noting that while a
French or Irish peasant will cling to his land at all costs; a business man engaged in land
speculation will sell out at what seems to him the most propitious moment and will regard
as absurdly old-fashioned any restrictions which prevent the present holder of land from
selling to him. The law does not indeed always conform to what is desired by one group or
another, or even express the balance of power between groups.105
Traditionally the law of private conveyancing was based on the principle of
static security.106 This was achieved through rules such as nemo dat quod non
habet, the priority for interests ﬁrst in time and the doctrine of notice. “Equity’s
preference for the ‘bona ﬁde purchaser for value without notice’, was an attempt to
balance static security against the reasonable expectations of purchasers in good
faith”.107 O’Connor is of the view that this suited a society where land ownership
was conﬁned to the privileged few and was rarely traded108 but with the move to
registration of title conveyancing law shifted towards rules that protect the trans-
feree and facilitate exchange.109
This move towards exchange value rather than use value can be seen in the
development of the complex commodities market which many commentators
blame for the current collapse of the global economy. These arguments come to
the fore when we look at the nature of title registration and its role in our society.
If due to an error there is a dispute about who owns and that error is due to some
fraud or fault of a stranger then innocent transferees could be pitted against innocent
transferors or prior owners. In this situation the question arises as to whether money
can compensate one party for the loss of title. The answer may be ‘no’ where the
property in question is a home and a disposed owner is to be compensated.
O’Connor notes that there has been a failure by the courts who adopt immediate

indefeasibility to “acknowledge the loss of static security and the hardship to
owners evicted from their homes as a result of a fraud.”110
The question needs to be asked whether or not it is time to reward the real victim in the
scheme of things, that is, the original registered proprietor. Is it not more sensible to offer
compensation, albeit in limited deﬁned circumstance, to innocent purchasers and
mortgagees.111
This is a valid argument. Should the transferor who lived in the property all their
life and who came back from holiday to ﬁnd that fraudsters had sold the property
not regain ownership and the new owner get compensation instead of being able to
retain the property?
4.5
Indefeasibility Outside Land Registration
It is not only in the context of land registration systems that this debate is being
waged.
As Davies points out in relation to the CREST system there are
obvious risks that either an unauthorised person obtains access to the system or a person
with authorised access uses the system in an unauthorised way, in both cases sending an
instruction to transfer shares not belonging to him or her to an innocent third party. Can the
former holder of the shares secure the restoration of his or her name to the. . .register to the
detriment of the third party?112
If the unauthorised instruction is sent in accordance with the rules, the recipient
is entitled, with few exceptions, to act on it and the person by whom or on whose
behalf it was purportedly sent may not deny that it was sent with property authority.
Thus a legal owner who was in no way to blame for the fraud may ﬁnd that title to
the shares has been lost.113 The owner may have a case against the agent whose
equipment was used to send the unauthorised instruction or against the system
operator if the instruction was not sent from a system computer or the instruction
should not have been acted upon.114
In general the CREST system favours dynamic security as the liability of the
system operator is capped and falls away entirely if the operator identiﬁes the
person responsible, even if the owner is not able to recover any compensation from
that person.115 The deﬁnition of ‘forged dematerialised instruction’ means that the
operator is liable for security defects in its system but not for unauthorised use of

the system.116 Thus transferees are protected at the expense of the transferor and not
at the expense of the company.
Micheler is of the view that investors in the system are protected to a lesser
extent against unauthorised transactions than investors who hold paper securi-
ties.117 “[T]he legal owner of certiﬁcated securities is better protected against
unauthorised transfers than the owner of uncertiﬁcated securities.”118 If a paper
certiﬁcate is stolen and the thief or a purchaser from the thief obtains registration,
the legal owner has a right to have his or her name restored on the register. This will
also apply if the legal owner entrusts an employee or broker with the paper
certiﬁcate. However in the case of uncertiﬁcated securities the owner is bound by
an instruction that is send with his or her password from his or her access terminal
even if the person accesses the system without his or her authority.
The same principle applies to an investor who accesses the system through a sponsor. He or
she is bound by unauthorised instructions sent by the sponsor on his or her behalf. In both
cases, the owner does not have a claim against the system operator because the instructions
sent were not forged. They were sent from a system terminal by a person who used the
correct password.119
Micheler does not suggest that these transactions should be unwound as this
would “seriously disrupt the system” but she does recommend that the position of
these investors could be signiﬁcantly improved by the implementation of a guar-
antee scheme similar to the scheme in place for bank deposits.120
4.6
Exceptions to Indefeasibility
Any formal elimination of indefeasibility would in Arrun˜ada’s view transform a
system from a Torrens registration of rights to a mere recording of deeds.121
However in New Zealand Greenwood and Jones argue that indefeasibility may
already be a myth from a practical point of view as there are a wide range of
exceptions which serve to undermine or seriously erode indefeasibility.122

Fraud is the common exception to indefeasibility.123 The principal other excep-
tions are overriding interests, in personam claims,124 the position of volunteers,
interests incapable of registration or excluded by statute e.g. statute of limita-
tions,125 and the registrar’s power of rectiﬁcation.126 The exceptions can be divided
into statutory127 and non statutory.128
In personam claims, often referred to as personal equities,129 allow a plaintiff to
bring an action against a registered owner, founded in law or equity, for such relief
as a court may grant. Low comments on the inappropriateness of both the in
personam and personal equity labels; the former because it implies that such claims
necessarily have no proprietary effect and the latter because it implies that “only
claims originating in equity fall within its embrace.”130
Many commentators do not consider in personam claims to be a true exception
to indefeasibility as the claim is against the registered owner personally and not a
proprietary claim against the land though the result of a successful claim may be to
create a “de facto proprietary interest, but not one that amounts to a legal interest in
the land, as a true proprietary claim would ordinarily do.”131 Low argues that
personal equities do not actually form an exception to indefeasibility but instead
the two concepts operate on completely different planes.132 Cooke and O’Connor
also point out that indefeasibility relates to the survival and priority of prior
unregistered interests as opposed to the creation of new ones.133 The “vital
123 See Cooke and O’Connor (2004), pp. 645–666 for a comparison of the ‘so called’ Torrens
systems [Australasia, Canada (excluding Ontario) and elsewhere in the Commonwealth] with the
English system. The deﬁnition of ‘Torrens’ fraud is behaviour on the part of the purchaser that will
nullify the indefeasibility protection; see p. 646.
124 A registered owner should not be allowed to refuse to perform contracts he had made and
anyone who entered into such a contract should be entitled to claim such relief in law or in equity
as a Court may grant. This includes speciﬁc performance or enforcement of a trust and may result
in the Court ordering the registered owner to part with his title. For an examination of these claims
and whether they detract from the principle of indefeasibility see Wu (2008), pp. 672–697. See
also Stevens and O’Donnell (2003) and Hughson et al. (1997), pp. 490–496.
125 Allowing for adverse possession.
126 See Deeney (2014), p. 340 for other examples.
127 Ruoff notes that many inconvenient breaches of indefeasibility occur primarily due to incon-
sistent legislation. See Ruoff (1952), p. 119. This causes loss of faith in the register and “unhap-
pily, each fresh breach made by a heedless or a ruthless legislature facilitates the making of future
breaches.” See p. 121.
128 Murphy notes that the register has always been qualiﬁed and thus the “principle of a mirror is a
good analogy because just as a mirror is only capable of reﬂecting what is physically present
before it so too. . .the register is limited in what can be reﬂected in it.” Murphy (2013), p. 9.

characteristic of this liability” i.e. in personam claims is that it arises anew from the
purchaser’s conduct.134
Mason is of the view that indefeasibility does not mean, and has never meant,
absolute indefeasibility135 and that some of the problems with the Torrens system
were “unreal expectations of what the system of registered title would deliver,
engendered by the notion of indefeasible registered title.”136 In support of this
perspective he notes that when introduced in Australia registration under the
Torrens system was voluntary and that equitable unregistered interests can be
created in respect of registered land.137
These exceptions to indefeasibility and their impact on land owners are explored
further in Chaps. 7 and 8.
4.7
Title Registration System in Ontario
Similar to Ireland there are two systems of recording information relevant to
property interests in Ontario. The older Registry system introduced in 1795 and
now governed by the Registry Act R.S.O. 1990138 (hereafter the Registry Act) and
the Land Titles system introduced in 1885 now governed by the Land Titles Act.
Like the Registry of Deeds in Ireland, the Registry system in Ontario offers no
statement of ownership or guarantee of title.139 It warrants only that the register is
properly created and that the documents are properly recorded. In both jurisdic-
tions, if the documents comply in form when lodged, the registrar has no authority
to refuse them for registration. The term deeds registration or unregistered title is
used to describe deeds registered in the Registry of Deeds in Ireland and deeds
registered in the Registry system in Ontario. The record held is the deeds register.
In the Land Titles system the records are organised and maintained as parcels
based on ownership. The government makes a statement of ownership and guaran-
tees the state of the title with some exceptions.140 The Ontario Land Titles system is
comparable to Ireland’s Land Registry system and the term title registration or
registered title is used to describe titles in this system. The title register is the record
held by the registering authority. The title register in Ontario is called a parcel
whereas in Ireland it is referred to as a folio.

Deﬁning Title Registration

Both jurisdictions are in the process of converting titles from the unregistered to
the registered system. In Ontario this process is done by ‘title automation’
i.e. conversion is done by the registry without the owners being aware that their
properties have been converted. Conversion is not triggered by a transaction with
the property but instead “is part of a systematic master conversion plan.”141
However in Ireland conversion is triggered by a transaction.
The World Bank has developed a league table on registering property in differ-
ent countries which is based on three criteria: the number of procedures involved,
the time taken and the cost. This table on registering property feeds into the World
Bank economy rankings for ease of doing business.142 It is one of eleven factors
which together determine the rankings for ease of doing business.
In the 2010 report143 Ireland and Canada were placed side by side at seventh and
eighth position respectively under the rankings for ease of doing business. By
contrast under the registering property rankings they were placed poles apart.
Ireland was ranked 79th and Canada 35th. The overall rankings up to June 2013
were poorer but show an improvement in Ireland’s ranking for registering property.
The scores are 15th and 19th respectively for the ease of doing business and 57th
and 55th for registering property. When Ontario was ranked separately from the
other Canadian provinces in 2005/2006 it was ranked ﬁrst.144
While these rankings have been subject to criticism145 and “[l]ike most interna-
tional comparisons, the results have to be treated with a certain amount of cau-
tion”,146 they are one measure of how effective the systems are perceived to be.
4.8
Estates and Interests Protected by the Title Register
in Ontario
Similar to other jurisdictions the Ontario title register mirrors and guarantees all
interests pertaining to the ownership of a parcel of land.147 Subject to some
exceptions a land owner can rely on the register and need not enquire about prior
transactions on the title. This is in stark contrast to the unregistered title system
which is not guaranteed by the state and where each time the property is sold a
40 year search of the prior title must be completed.148

Estates and Interests Protected by the Title Register in Ontario

Land owners may apply to have their title entered into the registered title system.
Alternatively the title may have been automatically entered into that system as part
of the implementation of eRegistration. Thus some titles are administratively
converted from the unregistered system into the registered system. This is not
done by the owner but is done automatically by the conversion of the title into
the registered title system. Teranet converts these titles into qualiﬁed titles called
Land Titles Conversion Qualiﬁed (LTCQ).
This is one of a number of titles that can be registered in this jurisdiction.
Section 32(2) of the Land Titles Act provides that land may be registered with an
absolute, possessory, qualiﬁed or leasehold title.149
The ﬁrst title is an absolute title. This title is subject to section 44(1) title
qualiﬁers and any encumbrances entered on the register.150 First registration of an
estate in fee simple will be registered as an absolute title.151
The second type of registered title is the LTCQ. These titles have been converted
from unregistered titles and they are subject to the title qualiﬁers set out in section
44(1). For example they are subject to mature claims for adverse possession,
misdescription and some short term unregistered leases.152 This qualiﬁcation for
short term unregistered leases is to reconcile the differences in the length of term
required before registration is required. This is 7 years for unregistered title and
3 years for registered title.
Donahue et al. note that one of the standard qualiﬁcations153 on an LTCQ title is
that the title is subject to the rights of a person who would, but for the Land Titles
Act, be entitled to the land or any part of it through length of adverse possession,154
prescription, misdescription or boundaries settled by convention i.e. agreement.
This will arises where the Teranet searchers have not been able to satisfy them-
selves as to inconsistencies in the description of the property and adjoining prop-
erties. As it is a form of qualiﬁed title it may also be subject to some other estate,
right or interest that is excepted.
However some of the section 44(1) qualiﬁers do not apply. For example is it
unnecessary to check for succession duties, dower rights,155 planning act contra-
ventions, spousal rights, railway interests and escheats to the Crown prior to the
149 See also sections 36–38 Land Titles Act.
150 Section 71 of the Land Titles Act provides a mechanism whereby those with unregistered
interests may register a notice of such rights on the registered title in order to protect them.

claims. See Donahue et al. (2003), p. 259.
155 Prior to 1978, under the Dower Acts, a widow had a right to tarry in her husband’s main house
for 60 days following his death. This right is now enshrined in section 26(2) of the Family Law
Act. A widow was also entitled to a one third possessory life interest however such rights, which
had not already vested by 31 March 1978, were abolished by the Family Law Reform Act, 1978,
S.O. 1978, c. 2.

date of conversion.156 Moore and Globe note that except for the uncertainty of
mature adverse possession and easement by prescription rights a LTCQ title pro-
vides a title guarantee superior to an absolute registered title.157 Donahue et al. also
state that the LTCQ title created under section 46 may be superior to the absolute
title referred to in section 45.158
During the automation process issues such as adverse possession could not be
dealt with so additional qualiﬁers are added to the parcel but other additional
guarantees to the title can be given due to the searches performed during the
conversion process.159 These additional guarantees, which apply as of the date of
conversion, include a guarantee against planning contravention, dower, succession
duty and previous corporate escheats or forfeitures to the Crown.160 Unlike the
previous system, the automation and conversion process does not include notifying
all the interested parties and thus it cannot guarantee against adverse possession,
survey issues and unregistered Registry leases. In the deeds system an unregistered
lease of 7 years or less is protected whereas in the title system an unregistered lease
of 3 years or less is protected.161 The additional qualiﬁers can be removed by
application.
The reason LTCQ titles are seen as superior is that these titles are not subject to
the following exceptions that would otherwise apply pursuant to section 44:
1. dower and spousal rights
2. succession duty liens
3. planning act contraventions prior to the date of transfer to registered title
4. provincial succession duties; and
5. escheats to the Crown following dissolution of a corporate registered owner.
The title is not subject to any of these arising before the date of registration in the
registered title system but may be subject to any that arise thereafter. Hence it will
not be necessary to search before the date of conversion but will be necessary to
search after that date, save in respect of dower and succession duty liens as these
have been abolished.162
This is an unusual anomaly whereby pre-existing absolute registered titles are
now, in effect, downgraded, to make way for a better class of new registered titles
that are based on the conversion of previous unregistered titles. This anomaly is

qualiﬁcations.

Estates and Interests Protected by the Title Register in Ontario

even more unusual in that the award of this title is not based on any application by
the land owner but instead is done automatically as part of the reform agenda.163
Teranet transfers these properties from the unregistered to the registered title
system pursuant to section 32 of the Land Titles Act.164 The owner does not initiate
this transfer and is not even notiﬁed.165
A land owner may apply to have a LTCQ title upgraded166 to Land Titles Plus
(LT Plus). The effect of this is to remove the qualiﬁers of mature adverse posses-
sion, easements by prescription, misdescription and pre-conversion unregistered
leases. Thus a LT Plus title has different title qualiﬁcations from both LTCQ and
absolute title parcels. Only the land owner can deal with these issues and thus the
prior automatic conversion was unable to address these qualiﬁers. Notice is served
on adjoining land owners so that they may raise objections if they wish. Once this
LT Plus title is awarded no claim for adverse possession can subsequently be made
in relation to the land. In addition the exceptions to the qualiﬁcations contained in
section 44(1) relating to dower, succession duties, planning act contraventions and
escheats found on the LTCQ parcel are carried forward into the LT Plus parcel.
Thus the parcel is free of these qualiﬁcations.
Thus an LT Plus title has “both the advantages of an LTCQ title and no adverse
possession rights. It is the best of all titles.”167 It can be “considered an upgrade as
the resulting title is superior to both an absolute title and LTCQ title as there are
fewer qualiﬁcations affecting it and a corresponding greater guarantee afforded by
the Act.”168
As noted already in Chap. 2 if these three types of registered title in Ontario were
graded according to the beneﬁts they offered the land owner they would be listed in
the following order:
1. LT Plus
2. LTCQ
3. Absolute title
This is in contrast with most other title registration systems, including Ireland’s,
where the absolute title remains the highest quality title on offer.
The LTCQ title and LT Plus title are both a product of the reform agenda in
Ontario however other forms of registered title have been and continue to be

164 Note that if material title problems are found the practice is not to convert that parcel to LTCQ
but to leave the title in the unregistered system. See Donahue et al. (2003), p. 30. Moore and Globe
(2003), p. 217 note that if the title deﬁciency is serious, while the title record will still be
automated, the title will be classiﬁed as a “non-convert”.

Deﬁning Title Registration

available on an application for ﬁrst registration. The ﬁrst is the absolute title
mentioned previously. The second is a leasehold title.
The registrar provides a separate leasehold register for long term leasehold
titles.169 This register contains leasehold land held under a lease for a life or
lives, or determinable on a life or lives, or for a term of years of which at least
21 are unexpired.170
The third type of title is a qualiﬁed title which is the same as the absolute title
except for any qualiﬁer or limitation entered on the register. LTCQ is a form of
qualiﬁed title.171
The registrar may also grant possessory title and this can be upgraded after
10 years. This can be granted on an application for ﬁrst registration.172 The registrar
could also register this title as an absolute title. Moore and Globe note that those
who go to the time and expense of making an application invariably choose to be
registered with absolute title and thus possessory registered title is extremely
rare.173 This is compounded by the fact that acquiring ownership rights through
possession is prohibited174 in respect of registered titles. Once a title is registered in
the registered title system no new possessory rights can be acquired.175 Thus
adverse possession or easements by prescription do not arise in respect of registered
land. LTCQ title is only subject to such claims arising before ﬁrst registration.
The complexity of the qualiﬁers that apply to the different types of registered
titles appear to have made title searching incredibly complex. Moore and Globe
note that it is relatively simple as compared to the 40 year search in the unregistered
system176 however with each class of registered title it is still necessary to search
behind the register to some degree.
Section 66 of the Land Titles Act provides that every transfer or charge shall,
until cut out by a conﬂicting registration, confer upon the person a right to be
registered as the owner of the land or charge. Section 72 provides that no person
other than the parties thereto shall be deemed to have notice of the contents of any
instruments other than those on the register or those in the course of entry.
Under section 78(5) of the Land Titles Act priority is determined according to
the order in which instruments are registered. Instruments will be registered in the
order each is received unless withdrawn, or containing a material error, omission or
deﬁciency, or there is evidence lacking, or the registrar declines registration for any
other reason. In those instances the registrar must under section 78(2) notify the
169 Section 38 Land Titles Act.
170 Where the remaining term of the lease is less than 21 years section 111 permits the registration
of a notice of lease against the freehold parcel.

parties or their lawyer within 21 days and must allow a period of at least 7 and not
more than 30 days for the application to be corrected. If it is corrected within this
time period priority will be retained but otherwise priority is lost.
Under section 78(3) registration is only complete when the entry is certiﬁed by
the registrar. Instruments gain priority according to the order in which they are
entered on the register and not according to the order in which they were created.177
This is despite any express, implied or constructive notice. Under section 78
(4) when registered an instrument is deemed to be effective according to its nature
and intent i.e. to create, transfer, charge or discharge as the case requires except in
the case of a fraudulent instrument. Section 78 (4.2) provides that this does not
invalidate the effect of a registered instrument registered subsequent to such a
fraudulent instrument (provided of course that the second instrument is not itself
fraudulent).178
Under section 71(1) any person entitled to or interested in any unregistered
estates, rights, interests or equities in registered land may protect same by entering a
notice, caution, inhibition or other restriction on the register. Where this is done
every registered owner and every person deriving title through the registered owner,
except prior owners, are bound by notice.
So the position in Ontario is straight forward. Instruments get priority according
to the date of registration except in the case of a fraudulent instrument. Transferees
are bound by notice of anything on the register and overriding interests179 but are
not otherwise bound.
4.9
Title Registration System in Ireland
In Ireland land registration is under the control of the PRA which was established
on 4 November 2006 under the provisions180 of the 2006 Act. The PRA is divided
into the Registry of Deeds which has operated since 1707181 and the Land Registry
which has operated since 1891.182
The Land Registry was founded in 1891 to provide a secure and reliable title
registration system for recording transactions. Its mission as expressed in the 2012

operation in Ontario.

180 Section 9.
181 Registration of Deeds (Ireland) Act, 1707. This was repealed by the Registration of Deeds and
Title Act 2006.
182 Local Registration of Title Act, 1891. Prior to that there was the Record of Title Act, 1865. This
earlier Act, however, provided only for a voluntary registration system and no more than 700–800
titles were registered under it. For the ﬁrst time under the 1891 Act registration in the Land
Registry was compulsory in certain cases.

Deﬁning Title Registration

Annual Report is “[t]o promote and safeguard the legal, societal and economic
framework of property ownership in Ireland.”183 The 1891 Act was replaced by a
modern statute which is the 1964 Act which came into effect on 1 January 1967.184
One of the main priorities for the Property Registration Authority is to complete the register
and to close the Registry of Deeds system. There is general agreement that this is a
pre-requisite to the full implementation of a system of eConveyancing in Ireland. . .The
registration of title system has a number of advantages over the deeds system:
•
State guarantee of title
•
Elimination of repetitious and time-consuming investigations of title
•
Transparent register showing property, ownership and interests
•
Curative effect on minor defects in title or descriptions
•
Accurate and up-to-date digital map
•
Advanced searching and indexing facilities
•
Supports eConveyancing.185
Since 1 June 2011 all areas are subject to compulsory ﬁrst registration (CFR) in
the case of freehold land upon conveyance on sale and in the case of a leasehold
interest on the grant or assignment on sale of such an interest.186 ‘On sale’ means
for money or money’s worth and accordingly would not apply to a voluntary
transfer of title by way of gift or a title transferred on death.187
Section 25 of the 1964 Act188 provides that where registration becomes com-
pulsory it must be carried out within 6 months of the relevant document becoming
operative, otherwise no title passes to the transferee. The registrar has power to
extend this period of 6 months. The section does not clarify where ownership of the
title goes after the 6-month period has expired without an application being made
for registration. The registrar will generally extend the 6-month period for regis-
tration but if for any reason they should refuse then the court has power to do
so. Thus while all land is now subject to compulsory ﬁrst registration this only
applies where there is a sale at arms length. Gifts and transmissions189 are excluded.
The ﬁrst strategic objective of the PRA is to complete the Irish land register.190
Ultimately this will lead to the closing of the Registry of Deeds.191 “The ultimate
goal is to have a uniﬁed system of title registration supportive of government

At present approximately 96 % of the land mass of the State and about 92 % of
legal titles are registered in the Land Registry.193 As of 1 June 2014 there are 2.14
million folios on the register194 and there are approximately 200,000–250,000
unregistered titles.195 While ﬁrst registration applications have been growing as
per Table 4.1,196 increased activity in the market and the extension of ﬁrst regis-
tration triggers is required in order to speedily move all titles onto the register.197
The Authority is looking at proposals relating to the extension of the triggers but
these are subject to authority and ultimately ministerial decision.198

Estates and Interests Protected by the Title Register
in Ireland
The Land Registry in Ireland maintains three registers. The ﬁrst register deals with
freehold interests, the second with leasehold interests and the third with subsidiary
interests. The subsidiary register deals with matters such as rentcharges, fee farm
rents, ﬁshing rights and some charges. The title to other interests may not be
registrable by themselves but may be registered as burdens against the title of
other interests or estates.
The Land Registry can register a person with two different classes of ownership;
full freehold owner or full leasehold owner.
a request by the owner would follow the Ontario model and be against the ‘principle of request’.

Deﬁning Title Registration

The register sets out different classes of titles which may be registered.199 Thus
within the classes of ownership are classes of title which identify the quality of the
title registered. There are seven classes of title:
1. Absolute freehold.
2. Possessory/subject to equities freehold.
3. Qualiﬁed freehold.
4. Absolute leasehold.
5. Possessory/subject to equities leasehold.
6. Qualiﬁed leasehold.
7. Good leasehold.
The best class of title is an absolute title. This can be given where the title is
approved by the Land Registry and the effect of registration is to vest in the
registered owner an estate in fee simple or the leasehold interest together with all
implied or express rights, privileges and appurtenances belonging or appurtenant
thereto.
A qualiﬁed title is the same as an absolute title but subject to qualiﬁcations
affecting the land at ﬁrst registration. Thus title is registered subject to speciﬁc
limitations. This limitation will except from the effect of registration any right
arising before a speciﬁed date, arising under a speciﬁed instrument or otherwise as
described in the register.
Possessory title, good leasehold title and qualiﬁed title may be converted into a
better class of title after a period of time and once various conditions are met.200
Good leasehold title will be granted where the title to the leasehold interest is
approved by the Land Registry but the lessor’s title has not been established. With a
good leasehold folio the State guarantee does not extend to the title of the lessor.
Possessory title will be granted where the Land Registry is not satisﬁed that an
absolute or qualiﬁed title is warranted. Previously these titles were referred to as
being subject to equities.
Section 52(1) of the 1964 Act provides that a transferee is vested with an estate
in fee simple on registration as full owner with an absolute title of freehold land and
this is only subject to registered burdens and section 72 burdens. Otherwise the
estate is free from all other rights, including rights of the state.
Section 31(1) of the 1964 Act provides that the register shall be conclusive
evidence of the title of the owner to the land as appearing on the register and of any
right, privilege, appurtenance or burden201 as appearing thereon; and such title shall
not, in the absence of actual fraud, be in any way affected in consequence of such
owner having notice of any deed, document or matter relating to the land. It goes on
to say that nothing in the 1964 Act shall interfere with the jurisdiction of the court

based on the ground of actual fraud or mistake and the court may upon such ground
make an order directing the register to be rectiﬁed.
This is the guarantee given by the State and is the basis for the integrity of the
register.202 The section also states that the doctrine of notice does not apply to
registered land. In effect it abrogates the equitable doctrine of notice.203 A trans-
feree for value who becomes registered as new owner is not affected by anything
that does not appear on the register. However a volunteer has no protection under
the Act. Also the protection offered by section 31 is limited. While the register is
conclusive evidence of the title and any right, privilege, appurtenance or burden
appearing therein this is subject to section 72 interests which bind without regis-
tration204 and the register being rectiﬁed for fraud or mistake.205 Section 30(1) pro-
vides that any disposition which if unregistered would be fraudulent and void shall,
notwithstanding registration, be fraudulent and void.
Also the description and map are not conclusive. Section 85 of the 1964 Act as
substituted by section 62 of the 2006 Act provides that the description of land on the
register shall not be conclusive as to its boundaries or extent. Registered boundaries
are thus often referred to as general boundaries.206
Section 72 burdens are binding even if the purchaser has no notice, actual or
constructive, of them. Lyall notes that this replaces the doctrine of notice and places
“an additional imposition on purchasers which is not found in unregistered con-
veyancing.”207 These overriding interests affect all classes of title in the register. In
addition the Statute of Limitations 1957 applies to registered land and thus a
registered title may be lost by adverse possession.208 Even before an adverse
possessor becomes a registered owner his or her interest is protected by section
72(1)(p). Thus the registered title is not guaranteed against all comers.
In relation to burdens section 69(1) sets out the class of burdens that may be
registered as affecting registered land.209 This includes inter alia any incumbrance
on the land existing at the time of the ﬁrst registration of the land, any charge

204 See Chap. 2 for details of the overriding interests in Ontario and Ireland.
205 Section 32 1964 Act.
206 Ontario and Ireland both operate general boundaries. Note however the decision in Boyle
v. Connaughton [2000] IEHC 28 (21 March 2000) where Laffoy, J. agreed that section 85 is only
intended to cover minor errors in calculation and it should not be taken that the provisions in the
Act as to the extent and boundaries of registered land not being conclusive extend to substantial
discrepancies in areas. Hence the Connaughton’s were entitled to succeed in their claim for
rectiﬁcation of the land registry map. See also Persian Properties Ltd v. The Registrar of Titles
and the Minister for Finance [2003] IESC 12. This general boundaries ‘rule’ means that other
evidence is admissible to determine the correct boundary and extent of the land. See Deeney
(2014), p. 34.
207 Lyall (2010), p. 937.

created after ﬁrst registration, any judgement or order of the Court, any judgment
mortgage or lis pendens, any easement or proﬁt a` prendre created by express grant
or reservation after the ﬁrst registration of the land or any easement or proﬁt a`
prendre where the Land Registry is satisﬁed, pursuant to section 49A, that there is
an entitlement to such an easement or proﬁt a` prendre.210 Some, but not all of these,
are V and U type claims. For example an easement is such a claim but C’s charge is
also a section 69 burden.
Conclusion
It is the protection, or lack thereof, that this registration offers to land owners,
third parties and property claimants that is the primary focus of this research
and how, in particular, this is impacted by the move towards eConveyancing.
Having articulated the methodology and neutral vocabulary in Chap. 2 and
explored eConveyancing and title registration in Chap. 3 and this chapter, the
background and framework for the modelling process has been set out. The
next chapter, Chap. 5, explains the model, identiﬁes the abstract participants,
the risks that they bear and categorises the pertinent risks.
Chapter 5 also looks at the distinction between a bona ﬁde purchaser for
value and a volunteer, the categorisation of rights and the sequential nature of
the conveyancing process as these have a bearing on the overall examination
of risk and also on the degree to which the conveyancing process can be
reformed to minimise or eliminate risk.

Chapter 5
Identiﬁcation of Risks
5.1
Modelling
As already stated in Chap. 1, given the broad nature of the conveyancing process, it
is not possible to deal with all the potential risks that might lead to loss in the course
of the operation of a conveyancing system (whether electronic or not). Thus this
analysis focuses on risk solely in the context of title registration.
In order to identify any relevant risks a transaction analysis is done through the
use of a model or abstracted process. This involves the creation of abstracted
conveyancing transactions and the allocation of risk to the parties to those trans-
actions. This type of model is an ‘idealised’ form of social reality.
In comparing law and economics Commons refers to the individualism of
economic theory, focused solely around the selﬁshness of the individual rather
than the interests of others.1 Thus some economists have borrowed from law the
method of approach adopted by the courts of deciding conﬂict between a plaintiff
and defendant “as representatives of two opposing classes of people. . .. The court
begins with a transaction. . .. Thus the method of approach is both individualistic
and socialistic.”2 This balance between the rights of the individual and the common
good can be explored by the use of a transactional analysis expressed through the
ideal model.
Schelling looks at some of the families of models that are widely used in the
social sciences.3 They are less commonly used in humanities. He advocates being
aware of applications outside one’s own ﬁeld as this can enhance appreciation of a
model and often the use one can make of it.4 In the case of his thermostat system the
model can be agreed without reference to any speciﬁc house. In the same way the

model here can be created without reference to any speciﬁc conveyancing
transaction.
Calabresi and Melamed warn of two shortcomings of model building; that
models can be mistaken for the total view of the phenomena and that models:
generate boxes into which one then feels compelled to force situations which do not truly
ﬁt. There are, however, compensating advantages. Legal scholars, precisely because they
have tended to eschew model building, have often proceeded in an ad hoc way....But this
approach. . ..may neglect some relationships among the problems involved in the cases
which model building can perceive, precisely because it does generate boxes, or
categories.5
Schelling notes that “[c]yclical behavior is one of those kinds of social behavior
for which it can be helpful to have a set of familiar models”6 and the conveyancing
process would certainly fall into this category. Each transaction follows the same
pattern. Schelling warns however of creating simple models for simple events as
they are so simple that no model is needed. In reverse he also warns of complicated
models as they may be too specialised to ﬁt any events except the particular events
from which the model was derived.7
Thus there is a balance to be achieved. “Models tend to be useful when they are
simultaneously simple enough to ﬁt a variety of behaviors and complex enough to
ﬁt behaviors that need the help of an explanatory model.”8
The use of theoretical models in property law is not new but has rarely been done
expressly. As noted above legal scholars tend to avoid model building. One
example is given by Miceli9 and his colleagues who developed a theoretical
model to determine how expected title risk and transaction costs affect land values
across two alternative title10 systems in Cook County, Illinois. This model identi-
ﬁed the relevant attributes of the two systems and their individual effects on land
prices. This attempt to compare the effects of two different systems is novel and it is
rarely done by the use of theoretical models, particularly not in property law.
Tiainen gives an example of semantic modeling in the property law ﬁeld11 while
an example of an object oriented approach is given by Paasch.12 Each approach
demonstrates the difﬁculties associated with capturing and exchanging knowledge
and information about speciﬁc aspects of property law.
Stuckenschmidt and his colleagues note that the signiﬁcant differences between
legal systems make conventional comparison approaches difﬁcult to apply and thus
they turned to modeling techniques from computer sciences in an attempt to

Identiﬁcation of Risks

compare property rights in Europe.13 Their research aimed ﬁrstly to provide a
comprehensive and comparable description of real property transactions across
European countries and secondly, to assess and compare the costs related to these
transactions.14 A modeling approach for transactions in land and other real property
was elaborated and tested primarily by researchers in land surveying, real estate
management, geo-information sciences and knowledge engineering. The model
was developed using computer language called Uniﬁed Modelling Language
(UML). This language is often used for the analysis and design of information
systems.15 The aim was to use this language to provide transparency and allow
comparison16 however “the inﬂuence of the national and social contexts, and the
different perspectives that can be taken, prevent a simple ranking of the studied
procedures. . .. the book eventually warns of simpliﬁcation in this ﬁeld full of
complex, national institutional arrangements.”17
Stubkjær and his colleagues point out that the focus was on describing a single
realistic case and thus avoid getting lost in differentiations particular to a single
country.18 However, “a straightforward comparison of the cost of comparable steps
in property transactions in different countries is tantamount to comparing apples
with oranges and reveals only half the truth.”19 After 4 years of research, by
multiple researchers in different jurisdictions, a tried and tested modelling tool,
when applied to real property transactions, only provided limited comparable data
on the costs involved.
This study makes evident the differences and thus the difﬁculties with eliciting a
common set of concepts and models across even neighbouring countries. The real
value in the research was in its articulation of the process which can be used for
improving efﬁciency, inspiring improvement and increasing transparency across
jurisdictions.
Zevenbergen notes that while those working on projects to introduce or improve
land registration “have gained considerable working expertise, there has been
relatively little attention for describing land registration in a theoretically sound
conceptual model.”20 He is of the view that such a model is needed for both
academic and practical reasons. Thus he presents a static model and a dynamic

model of land administration systems.21 The static model answers the questions of
who, where, how much and how i.e. the owner, parcel and the right or title. These
are represented diagrammatically as a mushroom. However this model on its own
“falls short when trying to understand for instance the interaction between LASs
[land administration systems] and land markets, the reasons for unregistered trans-
actions, and the trustworthiness of the whole.”22 For this reason he also presents the
dynamic model which addresses the functions of adjudication (ﬁrst registration),
transfer and subdivision.
Thus while the use of models in property law is not new it has rarely been done
expressly and as such it provides a novel approach for analysing risk in convey-
ancing transactions. The model here involves the creation of abstracted convey-
ancing transactions and the allocation of risk to the parties to that transaction. The
use of abstracted transactions with abstract participants generalises the problematic
and allowed the risks to be identiﬁed and allocated. This approach removed the
difﬁculties associated with using live empirical data.23
The two most common conveyancing transactions are modeled; an arms length
transaction for value and a gift i.e. transaction not for value. While land owners
generally purchase their homes it is common in Ireland for family members to gift
each other land to build upon. Thus the schematic includes a gift.
The second reason for this inclusion is that the law provides less protection to a
volunteer as set out later in this chapter. This means that the risk proﬁle of the
transferee and donee are different and these differences merit examination partic-
ularly given the move towards eConveyancing.
The abstract participants for the arms length transaction are the transferor,
transferee, prior lender and acquisition lender. The abstract participants for the
gift transaction are the donor and donee. The acquisition lender is removed for the
gift transaction as ﬁnancing would not be required. Both transactions could be
impacted by third parties or property claimants. The risks in conveyancing trans-
actions are identiﬁed, analysed and allocated to these participants. This requires an
examination of which of the abstract participants suffers if the risk leads to a loss.
As the focus is on risk solely in the context of title registration both titles are
registered.

5.2.1
Transaction for Value
The parties to this transaction are:
A—transferor
B—transferee
T—prior lender
C—acquisition lender
The name of the property is “Greenacre”.
A sells the freehold title to Greenacre to B. B makes this purchase with loan
funds advanced by C and this loan is secured by a charge on the title. A’s title is
unencumbered save for the charge in favour of T. This charge held by T will be paid
in full from the purchase monies and will then be removed from the title register.
This will allow C’s new charge to be registered as a ﬁrst legal charge on B’s title to
the property.

5.2.2
Transaction Not for Value i.e. a Gift
The parties to this transaction are:
X—donor
Y—donee
T—prior lender
The name of the property is “Whiteacre”.
X gifts the freehold title to Whiteacre to Y.
The additional parties that might arise in both transactions are:
U—third party
V—property claimant
D—subsequent purchaser (purchasing from B or Y)
The position of D will only be examined where it differs from that of B.
5.2.3
Distinction Between U and V
When V is successful in asserting a property claim against the land, he becomes U,
the third party. Thus V is only of relevance when exploring the effect of a claim that
changes or matures. For example V may have an equitable remedy that matures and
as a result he obtains a remedy against another party. That remedy is only of interest
when, and if, it becomes a proprietary interest in the land i.e. the point at which V
becomes U. This may be due to a court order or some factor such as occupation of
the property or the passing of a time period e.g. 12 years adverse possession.
V is also of signiﬁcance when looking at rights that are not recognised and not
capable of registration. V may have a claim but it may not be sufﬁciently mature to
affect the land or it may be a personal claim that is not capable of becoming a
property claim. V may be able to register a note on the register temporarily but
when his claim is defeated this note will be removed.
V is also of relevance in the context of a land owner’s freedom of contractual
action. If A or X grant new rights to V and those are upheld by the courts then V
becomes U.
The role of V will be referred to separately to illustrate these particular aspects
but otherwise U, the third party, should be taken to include V when he is successful
in a claim against the land.
Having identiﬁed the participants to the model transactions the next step is to
look at the perspective of each individual participant so as to determine the liability
each bears for risk. Thus this examination looks at the conveyancing process from
the standpoint of each abstract participant and examines how risk is distributed
between those participants.
158

Identiﬁcation of Risks

5.3
Standpoints
Standpoint in this context is deﬁned in terms of role of each participant expressed as
personiﬁcations.24 Thus a speciﬁc person is of no interest. These roles or players in
the conveyancing process are transferor, transferee, donor, donee and lender. The
role of the lender may be divided into the prior lender and the acquisition lender.
Other participants are the third party and property claimant who may be a spouse,
neighbour or other party seeking to protect an existing right or assert a new right in
relation to the property. More detailed explanations of these players are set out in
Chap. 2.
This meaning of standpoint:
implies some criteria of relevance determined by the conception of the task or role or
objective in question. Thus, “the standpoint of the judge” assumes some more or less
clearly deﬁned notion of “the judge’s role” which provides, inter alia, a basis for deter-
mining what the judge needs to know and to understand in order to do his job, as he or as
others conceive it.25
An individual player or participant is of no concern e.g. a transferor in a real life
transaction. Instead we are focused on the standpoint of all similar type participants
i.e. all transferors in the conveyancing process. The collective of these objectives,
viewpoint or interests allows each role in the conveyancing process to be expressed
over indeﬁnite repetitions i.e. all conveyancing transactions.
Taking the viewpoint of each player or role in the conveyancing process and
identifying the desires and interests of that role provides a tool for evaluating the
process. This evaluation is expressly based on a restricted view of the conveyancing
process as anything the abstracted participants are not concerned with or about is
excluded from the analysis.
Thus standpoint allows us to take an integrated substantive law and institutional
process approach as the abstract participant is trying to achieve something from the
law, and is not a disinterested expositor of it. Each abstract participant or person-
iﬁcation has some objective that they wish to achieve from the conveyancing
process. This objective is shared across all real life parties fulﬁlling the same role.
In terms of the debate between use value and exchange value all participants will
be interested in the property maintaining its exchange value but only those who
wish to occupy will be interested in its use value.
The key objective for each participant is summarised in Table 5.1.
The objectives are depersonalised in this model as we are dealing with abstract
participants rather than real people who by their nature will exhibit personal
characteristics such as greed and dishonesty or engage in fraud or sharp practice.
A real life seller would likely push for the highest possible purchase price, negotiate
the lowest possible professional fees and push for the purchase monies to be paid

over to them immediately on completion in a spendable form. Our abstract partic-
ipants display none of these personal characteristics. Thus risks arising from fraud
or dishonesty are excluded except where the threat is posed by someone other than
the abstract participants. Our abstract ‘pure’ participants are deemed to have acted
correctly at all time.
The standpoint and criteria of relevance of each abstract participant in this model
are set out below. This standpoint provides a basis for identifying the threats or risks
to that role in the conveyancing transaction.
Each participant is open to numerous risks. The focus is on risk solely in the
context of its impact on title registration and the security, protection or lack thereof
that this registration offers to land owners, third parties and property claimants.
Other risks that challenge the key objective of each abstract participant fall outside
the remit of this analysis.
Each participant is examined according to their standpoint and the risks are
identiﬁed. Those in italics are to be examined and those in normal text are excluded
as they fall outside the remit.
5.3.1
Standpoint of Transferor
An objective of the transferor will be the desire to have sole and uncontested right
of disposition. The transferor will wish to have an absolute right to sell the property
and for this right to be uncontested so that no one else can prevent the sale.
The transferor wishes to sell his interest for the purchase monies and have no
further liability in relation to the property after completion. Such liability might
arise from:
(a) A lender enforcing the terms of a secured charge that has not been discharged by
the sale
(b) The assurance does not deal with the transferors entire interest in the property
(c) Liability arises on foot of ancillary documentation furnished to the transferee at
the time of completion

Standpoint of Transferee
The transferee wishes to pay the purchase monies at completion and immediately
acquire occupation and registered title that is not subject to challenge. Such
challenges might arise from the following:
(a) Some other party is in occupation of the property
(b) An unknown or undisclosed claim by a third party or property claimant arises
that binds the transferee
(c) The property is subject to restricted use
(d) There has been a breach of the terms of the contract or assurance e.g. the nature
and quality of the title has been misrepresented
(e) There is a prior encumbrance on the title that has not been cleared e.g. a
secured loan
(f) The transaction cannot be registered as the transferor did not have title
(g) There is a delay in registration and some other intervening interest is registered
during this delay

(j) Registration is subject to a post registration claim which leads to rectiﬁcation
(k) An unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the register
5.3.3
Standpoint of Lender
The acquisition lender wishes to advance money for the purchase so as to make a
proﬁt and immediately have a registered ﬁrst legal charge on the title until the full
amount of the loan is paid. The prior lender wishes to have the loan plus interest and
any other fees arising on foot of the charge repaid before or at completion of the sale
of the property. During the term of the loan a lender may wish to enforce the terms
of the charge if there is a breach by the mortgagor. The following risks may arise:
(a) Delay in registration and some other intervening interest is registered
(b) Prior encumbrance on the title that has not been cleared e.g. another charge
takes priority
(c) The charge cannot be registered as the mortgagor did not have title to grant the
charge
(d) Some other event or formality is required for registration to take place
(e) The charge is not effective and cannot be enforced due to some breach of the
required formalities
(f) The charge is not repaid before or at completion
(g) The charge cannot be enforced against a third party who is interested in the land
and therefore has little or no value as security
(h) The charge is ineffective due to a substantive wrong or defect and rescission is
available e.g. undue inﬂuence or unconscionable bargain
(i) An unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the register
These risks will be examined primarily from the perspective of the acquisition
lender who is advancing money to the transferee to ﬁnance the conveyancing
transaction. This party is the provider of secured ﬁnance for the purchase. This
role includes where the transferee re-mortgages after the purchase as this lender will
be stepping into the shoes of the acquisition lender and will be seeking to have a ﬁrst
legal charge registered against the title.
In any particular conveyancing transaction the aims of the prior lender and
acquisition lender will differ but over a series of transactions, as set out in the
model, the role will be the same. On a subsequent transaction the acquisition lender
becomes the prior lender.

Standpoint of Donor
The donor wishes to gift his interest and have no further liability in relation to the
property after completion. Such liability might arise from:
(a) A lender enforcing the terms of a secured charge that has not been discharged at
the time of the gift
(b) The terms of the assurance not being fulﬁlled so that the donor is subject to a
claim for
•
Misrepresentation
•
Deceit
•
Breach of covenants of title
As the transaction is a gift the donor will be subject to a lesser duty than a
transferor.
(c) A claim of prior ownership from someone seeking
•

•
Occupation
•
Damages
(d) Proceedings in relation to the property such as
•
A claim by a third party or property claimant
•
A claim in tort e.g. for an injury on the property

Standpoint of Donee
The donee wishes to accept the gift and immediately acquire registered title that is
not subject to challenge. Such challenges might arise from the following:
(a) Some other party is in occupation of the property
(b) An unknown or undisclosed claim by a third party or property claimant arises
that binds the donee
(c) The property is subject to restricted use
(d) There has been a breach of the terms of the assurance e.g. the nature and quality

(j) Registration is subject to a post registration claim which leads to rectiﬁcation
(k) An unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the register
5.3.6
Standpoint of Third Party
The third party wishes to protect their existing right in relation to land such as an
easement or an equitable interest. The risk for the third party is that they will not be
able to protect the right because:
(a) some other right has priority and destroys the third party right
(b) some other right has priority and makes their right less valuable
(c) the right is not protected by the registering authority as it is not recognised as a
right capable of registration by the legislation
(d) An unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the register
5.3.7
Standpoint of Property Claimant
The property claimant wishes to claim or assert a new right in relation to land. The
risk for the property claimant is that they will not be able to claim or assert the right
because:
(a) some other right has priority and destroys their right
(b) some other right has priority and makes their right less valuable
(c) the right is not protected by the registering authority as it is not recognised as a
right capable of registration by the legislation
(d) An unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the register
In respect of both the third party and property claimant the right that has priority
and destroys their right might in fact be the right of the parties to the transaction.
The transfer or charge might itself be the event that destroys or damages their right
thus protecting the dynamic property rights of the transferee or chargee at the
expense of the right of the third party or property claimant.

the risks to be examined and also sets out a structure for allowing similar type risks
to be dealt with together. It establishes six categories of risk.
The transferor and donor share the same risks as do the transferee and donee.
Similarly the third party and property claimant share the same risks but the
acquisition lender has to be dealt with separately. However, while some parties
do share the same risk heading, each party must be examined individually as the
impact of that risk will not be the same.
Thus while the matrix at Table 5.2 groups the participants, for the purposes of
identifying the key risks to be examined, they will be unbundled in the following
chapters which look at the speciﬁc impact on each individual participant. Some
participants may be affected by risk in terms of a monetary loss in their investment
whereas for other participants the loss may be a loss of use or a loss of enrichment.
Thus the key risks to be examined, and their associated colours in the matrix at
Table 5.2, are:
1. Registration gap: time lag between transfer and registration (blue)
2. Formalities for registration: some other event required before registration (pink)
3. Error in the register (green)
4. Interests off the register which affect title (purple)
5. Interests not recognised and not capable of registration (orange)
6. Destructive effects of a registered transaction (brown)
From the examination above it can be seen that conveyancing transactions
inherently bring risks to the participants and eConveyancing is not some magic
formula that can dissipate risk in its entirety. That said there is the potential for risk
to be mitigated for some participants though this may result in increased risk for
other participants.
The law treats some of these abstract participants more favorably than others. In
particular it makes a clear distinction between the protection afforded to a bona ﬁde
purchaser for value and a volunteer.27 In the schematic the transferee B, and
subsequent purchaser D, are bona ﬁde purchasers for value. C will usually be
treated in a similar manner as a lender for value. By contrast as Y is obtaining a
gift the law provides less protection to this participant and thus Y is subject to
increased risk in the conveyancing process. Y is a volunteer.
O’Connor notes that all reform bodies in Australia and Canada who have
examined voluntary transfers in recent years have concluded that volunteers should
be afforded the same registration protection as purchasers for value, to facilitate the
generation of new wealth, as “[i]t is not in the interests of general economic welfare
27 See sections 52(2) and 55(2) of the 1964 Act which provide that where the transfer is made
without valuable consideration, to a volunteer, then the transferee is subject to all unregistered
rights subject to which the transferor held the land transferred. Similarly in Ontario under sections
90 and 109 of the Land Titles Act a volunteer is subject to any unregistered estates, rights, interests
or equities subject to which the transferor held the land. It is irrelevant that the unregistered right
was unregistrable or could have been protected by a note on the register or could have been
registered itself but no such registration was made.

to allow the titles of volunteers to remain clouded.”28 However given the spate of
voluntary dispositions to spouses occurring as a result of the property crash, this
approach is unlikely to be adopted in Ireland.
As Lyall has pointed out “[t]he law assists the buyer of commodities in the
market, but not those who take, even innocently, outside the market.”29 Thus B and
C are afforded a greater degree of protection than Y in conveyancing transactions.
5.5
Distinction Between Bona Fide Purchaser for Value
and Volunteer
It is a well-settled principle of common law that a bona ﬁde purchaser for value
without notice30 acquires a good title to property unaffected by matters of which
they had no notice.31 The question of notice may arise either by some matter arising
from the title or replies to enquiries or may be apparent from an inspection of the
premises.
If the purchaser is ﬁxed with notice then he will take subject to the rights and
interests which reasonable enquiries and searches would have revealed. The ques-
tion as to what is reasonable may be difﬁcult to determine as it will depend on the
facts of a particular case.
The law will protect the transferee as a bona ﬁde purchaser for value provided he
is not on notice of the matter prejudicial to his interest. If he is on notice then his
interest will be subject to it. In order to avail of this protection the transferee must
carry out reasonable enquiries and searches so he is not ﬁxed with constructive
notice of some matter that would have come to his attention, but did not, because he
failed to carry out such enquiries and searches. Standardised enquiries and searches
have thus become a major part of any conveyancing transaction.
For unregistered land this doctrine of notice still applies to ﬁx a person with
knowledge and to determine priorities between interests. After the title is registered
it still has a role to play in ﬁxing a purchaser with notice of the contents of the
register and to ﬁx a land owner with knowledge of fraud.
Otherwise in the case of registered land the equitable doctrine of notice is
replaced by the principle of registration.32 The purchaser is deemed to have notice
of any matter on the register but what about matters off the register? The idea of the
register being a mirror of the title implies that it is only the register that needs to be
consulted. Certainly the original vision of title registration was that it would replace

the need for the detailed investigation of title and of prior transactions required by
conveyancing of unregistered land. The register would be all. This was seen as one
of the major beneﬁts in moving to title registration.
However this simplistic vision has not borne fruit. Instead there has been an
extensive growth33 in the interests and charges affecting land which are not
reﬂected on the register and which are not easily discoverable by an inspection of
the property.34 The majority are created by statute and are burdens on the land
which affect successive owners.35 To add to this difﬁculty they are generally not
registered in any central searchable register and can only be determined by making
written enquiries to numerous different bodies.
Overriding interests affect title without registration but, in a situation where
there are no such interests, an owner of registered land acquired for value is not
affected by any unregistered right in or over the land. In the schematic B, C and, on
a subsequent transaction, D will acquire registered title unaffected by any prior
unregistered interests. This is subject to any such interests not having been
protected by a notice on the register or having gained priority by registration.
Searches and enquiries will be required to establish whether there are any
interests noted on the register, any pending registrations, overriding interests or in
personam claims such as pending litigation or judgments about to be registered
against the title. The existence of such claims raises the specter of some other
interest being registered in the registration gap ahead of B or C’s interest. A prudent
purchaser and lender would require such claims to be dealt with before completion.
The position of Y as a volunteer is very different.36 A voluntary conveyance is
usually between related parties where the donor transfers to the donee for ‘natural
love and affection’. No purchase monies are paid.37 The law takes the view that a
donee will ‘not look a gift horse in the mouth’ and will take the gift regardless of
any title defects. Thus a donee is unlikely to carry out the usual enquiries in relation
to the property or title. In addition the law tries to avoid the situation where a donor
transfers to a spouse, sibling or other related person in order to avoid the title being
claimed by creditors or someone else who has an interest in the property.38 Thus the
transaction is more likely to be set aside.
For these reasons a volunteer is not given the same protection as a bona ﬁde
purchaser for value. The donee is deemed to take his interest subject to all prior
interests, whether registered or not.

34 Murphy refers to the extensive list of overriding interests. See Murphy (2013), p. 21.

(2005), p. 99.
36 Deeney notes that the distinction between purchasers and volunteers is fundamental as a
volunteer take the registered title ‘warts and all’. See Deeney (2014), p. 340.
37 A judgment mortgagee is a volunteer. See ACC Bank plc. v. Markham [2007] 3 IR 533.
38 See section 74 of the 2009 Act. The usual practice in Ireland is to obtain a declaration of
solvency from the donor and to carry out a bankruptcy search.
170

Identiﬁcation of Risks

Section 52(2) of the 1964 Act provides that where the transfer is made without
valuable consideration, to a volunteer, then the transferee is subject to all
unregistered rights subject to which the transferor held the land transferred.
Section 55(2) is the corresponding provision in relation to a leasehold interest
which is also subject to the implied and express covenants, obligations and liabil-
ities incident to the leasehold interest being transferred. A similar effect arises in
relation to the other classes of registered titles save and except that these classes of
registered titles have additional qualiﬁcations as denoted by their labelling
i.e. possessory title, qualiﬁed title and good leasehold title. Similarly in Ontario
under sections 90 and 109 of the Land Titles Act a volunteer is subject to any
unregistered estates, rights, interests or equities subject to which the transferor held
the land.
It is irrelevant that the unregistered right was unregistrable or could have been
protected by a note on the register or could have been registered itself but no such
registration was made.
Thus while B and C will be able to take title free of such unregistered rights, Y
will not. He will be bound by all unregistered rights to which X held the land.
However if Y sells the land to D, D will take title free of such unregistered rights.
5.6
Categorisation of Rights
Generally rights can be divided into a number of categories however it should be
acknowledged that some rights fall into more than one category.
We take trouble in our legislation to ensure that the rights are codiﬁed and that the systems
of rights transfer will work effectively. We ensure that third party rights are recorded so that
all with a stake in the land parcel are protected under the law.39
Thus this categorisation of rights demonstrates what society values as being
important. It determines which rights are deemed as being more vital than others
and this in turn illustrates whose standpoint is valued.
A simplistic view would divide rights into two categories; property rights which
bind land and personal rights, incorporating all other rights, but this division does
not reﬂect the true complexity. Some property rights may be capable of binding
land but may not do so because they are not registered or can be defeated. Some
rights may be property rights but not in the land. Instead the property may be a
trust fund.
The rights capable of substantive registration have already been examined in
Chap. 4.
There are also property rights that are capable of affecting title but which cannot
be registered directly. They may be rights capable of registration but only as
39 Manthorpe (2007), p. 2.
5.6
Categorisation of Rights
171

burdens on the registered title e.g. a charge. These rights need to be registered to
gain priority. These rights may be destroyed by a transaction to a bona ﬁde
purchaser for value. The risks to the idealised participants presented by these rights
are examined in Chap. 8.
Some rights are protected as overriding interests. This category of rights can be
divided into two speciﬁc types; those that are overriding by their nature and those
that are overriding by occupation. They affect title without registration and bind the
world. There is no distinction between how they affect bona ﬁde purchasers for
value and volunteers. The speciﬁc risks these overriding interests present to the
idealised participants are also examined in Chap. 8.
There are also purely personal rights that are not capable of registration and are
not recognised as being capable of affecting title to land.
Only those rights which are conventionally classiﬁed as proprietary have the potential to
bind a purchaser of the land. Personal rights can never do so, although they may sometimes
retain a limited enforceability (usually by way of a remedy in damages) against their
grantor, the former owner of the estate now transferred. In effect, those claims or interests
which appear low in the calibrated scale of ‘property’ value. . .will simply not make the
grade. Even though they relate in some way to the land, they lack a sufﬁcient intensity of
‘property’ content to merit general or long-term protection. Consequently they do not rank,
in the relevant conveyancing sense, as proprietary rights in land and cannot survive
dispositions of the estate to which they refer.40
Some of these rights always remain personal whereas others may be considered
hybrid rights as they are capable of being converted into a property right that is
recognised. An example is a debt that is converted into a judgment mortgage that is
then registered against the title. Purely personal rights fall outside the remit of this
analysis. Hybrid rights are however of relevance i.e. when V makes a successful
property claim and becomes U. This aspect is also examined in Chap. 8.
From time to time rights may move from one category to another based on how
they are treated by the legislature and courts.
Gray and Gray present a ﬁgure representing rights in land.41 This ﬁgure divides
registered title into four categories; registered estates which can be substantively
registered, registered charges which are non-substantively registrable; registrable
(minor) interests which can be protected by entry of notice and overriding interests
which are automatically binding unless overreached.
The interest being sold by A to B and transferred from X to Y in the schematic is
a registered freehold title. This is a right capable of substantive registration in the
title register as a registered estate. By contrast C’s right is only capable of regis-
tration as a burden on the registered title as a registered charge. The freehold title
can be substantively registered under its own unique folio number and the charge
held by C will be registered by entry against that freehold folio.

Identiﬁcation of Risks

B, C and Y will be attempting to complete the transaction and attain registration
free from the interests of U and V. U and V may hold a registrable (minor) interest
or an overriding interest capable of being overreached.
The transaction may provide an opportunity for U and V to interpose their right
or interest ahead of B, C and Y or may defeat the right or interest held by U and
V. Thus it is necessary to consider brieﬂy the nature of the conveyancing process
itself before undertaking a detailed examination of the speciﬁc risks.
5.7
Conveyancing as a Process
Conveyancing is a continual series of steps occurring over a period of weeks,
months and in the occasional instance over years. It is not a ﬁxed point in time
though many of the formal stages can be linked to a ﬁxed point such as the
execution of the contract or assurance, completion and registration.
Much of the tension between the, often competing, interests of the participants
can be addressed by effective management and co-ordination of this process. For
example if the process allows for the time of completion to correspond exactly with:
(a) the payment of the purchase monies in a disposable form;
(b) the taking of occupation;
(c) discharge of any prior registered charge;
(d) the registration of the transferee’s title; and
(e) the registration of the acquisition lender’s charge
then a number of the risks set about above can be avoided.
For example the following risks would be minimised and possibly even
eliminated:
(a) the prior lender enforcing the terms of a secured charge that has not been
discharged by the sale;
(b) the purchase monies being withheld;
(c) some other party being in occupation of the property;
(d) the transaction not being registered as the transferor did not have title;
(e) a delay in registration allowing some other intervening interest to be registered;
(f) some other event or formality being required for registration to take place;
(g) the new charge not being registered as a ﬁrst legal charge as some other
intervening interest arose e.g. another charge takes priority;
The delay between stages in the paper process occurs while the paper, and often
the money, has to be transmitted from one physical location to another. After
completion occurs in the paper process:
5.7
Conveyancing as a Process
173

(a) the cheque or bank draft has to be lodged with the lender and it may take 3–5
days to clear. In the interim it may be lost, stolen or withdrawn.
(b) the transferee or donee may not be able to collect the keys immediately in order
to take occupation.
(c) it may take a few days for the paper to arrive in the registering authority and it
will then have to join the queue. In the interim the title may be transferred
elsewhere or an intervening interest may be registered.
Thus the timeline of the conveyancing process has a signiﬁcant impact on the
level of risk.
In order to mitigate these risks lawyers have adapted the process in various ways.
The purchase monies may be paid in advance of completion and held in trust by the
transferor’s lawyer. A priority period may be used to protect the application
pending registration though this is rarely used in Ireland.42 Carrying out searches
against the title provides reassurance to the transferee that there is no other
application that might take priority. The transfer might also be executed in advance
and held in escrow pending completion so as to avoid the necessity to simulta-
neously co-ordinate physical execution and completion. However these adaptations
do not eliminate the risks entirely.
Each step in the current process is conditional upon satisfaction of other steps
being completed or certain conditions being met so by its very nature conveyancing
is sequential. The question arises as to what extent technology might shorten this
sequence or even eliminate parts of it entirely. Can parts be done simultaneously or
does the process by necessity require certain delays to be built in and one step to be
done in advance of another?
The argument may be made that it takes time to resolve the competing interests
of the parties and any delay in the process allows the opportunity for this to be done.
It may also be argued that consumers need that time to consider what is possibly the
most important investment in their lives. However a similar argument cannot be
used in respect of investors for whom the property is merely another commodity to
be used or traded for proﬁt. Their interest will likely be to complete the transaction
in as quick and simple a manner as possible.
Transformation of the process by the elimination of paper and its replacement
with instant electronic communication has the potential to impact signiﬁcantly on
risk. One of the gaps in this timeline is the time lag between transfer and registra-
tion. This is known as the registration gap and is the ﬁrst key risk to be examined.
42 Cooke notes that in England where priority searches are used, the registered title is frozen and a
purchaser can proceed with conﬁdence as to the state of the register however overriding interests
are not frozen. The danger of them coming into being during the registration gap is a “signiﬁcant
hazard”. See Cooke (2003), p. 289.

Identiﬁcation of Risks

Conclusion
Having examined the nature of eConveyancing and title registration and
identiﬁed the risks borne by each participant, it remains to determine how
each risk is impacted by the move to eConveyancing, how each party might
be protected, is such protection desirable and feasible and if not, what other
party should bear the risk. Chapters 6–8 examine these in the context of each
risk category.
Chapter 6 looks at two risk categories i.e. the registration gap and the
formalities for registration thus examining the situation before registration of
the title. The risk arising from the interface of the registration system with
those participants who seek registration is examined.
Chapter 7 examines the impact of the register itself. The participant has
made a successful application for registration but due to some error in the
transaction or by the registering authority their interest is at risk.
Chapter 8 explores the remaining risk categories. These are interests off
the register which affect title, the destructive effects of a registered transac-
tion and where interests are not recognised and are not capable of registration.
Each demonstrates how third party rights are impacted by the operation of the
registration system and the effect of those rights on the other participants.
The concluding chapter, Chap. 9, takes an overarching view of the impact
of eConveyancing on risk and determines if there can be risk mitigation. It
also makes some recommendations for further research and reform of the
conveyancing process in Ireland.

Identiﬁcation of Risks

Chapter 6
Before Registration
6.1
Introduction
This chapter examines two risk categories; the registration gap and the formalities
for registration. Thus it explores risk arising before registration of the transfer of
Greenacre and Whiteacre. The risk to those participants who seek registration
on foot of the idealised transactions is considered. These participants are the
transferee B, donee Y and acquisition lender C.
6.2
Registration Gap
The registration gap is the time lag between transfer and registration. It is the
“hiatus between the date of the making of the disposition and the date of its
registration”.1 Registration could occur some considerable time after the disposi-
tion. This gap poses a risk to those who buy registered land or who wish to acquire
some right or interest over the land.2
This time gap between transfer and registration is seen as a presenting a period of
risk for the transferee and acquisition lender. The transferee has parted with the full
purchase monies, part or all of which will comprise the monies advanced by the
acquisition lender, but neither will yet have the protection of registration. Thus the
interests of B and C are at risk.
Y’s interest is also at risk but since he has not paid any monies and is a volunteer,
his loss is of a different nature. Y’s exposure is as great as B’s in that both are in
danger of losing the entire value of the property. However, Y’s risk is not of loss,
but of no gain. He may lose an enrichment but will not be impoverished in the same

way that B and C might. Both B and C are at risk of suffering a monetary loss. B is
further exposed in that he may have given up the right to occupy elsewhere but still
may not have the use value of Greenacre. Thus the nature of each idealised
participant’s exposure to risk during the registration gap is different.
However there is not the same level of risk exposure during the entire period. In
Ireland there is less risk after the application for registration is lodged. Provided
such an application is successful registration will be backdated to the date of
lodgement and priority will arise from that date. Anyone dealing with the title
after the application is lodged but before the registering authority staff process the
application will be on notice as a pending dealing will be noted on the folio.
However if the application is not successful and is rejected then the registration
gap is extended as priority will be lost. Any subsequently pending applications will
be processed and priority will be lost until a successful application is lodged.
Presuming any application for registration is successful the exposure to risk
really arises during the period between completion of the transaction and lodgement
of the application for registration. C has released the loan funds, B has paid over the
purchase monies but there is the danger of another interest getting registered in
advance of theirs. The gap between contract and completion does not present the
same exposure to risk as no funds have been released to A.3
The risk period is extended if registration is denied due to some fault or error in
the transaction or the registering authority mistakenly rejects the application.
Presuming that the application is a successful application for registration the risk
arises if some event occurs after completion and before the application for regis-
tration. The vulnerability to that risk is a product of the conveyancing process.
So the risk period may be divided into two. The gap between completion and the
application for registration. This is not produced by the registration system but
instead is a feature of the conveyancing process and will be compounded if there is
some neglect by the lawyer and hence delay in applying for registration. The second
period arises between the application for registration and actual completion of
registration and this is a feature of the registration process.
A priority period mechanism could reduce the likelihood of an intervening event
having a detrimental effect on the transaction but this would similarly be dependent
on the subsequent application for registration being successful. If for any reason the
application for registration was rejected priority would be lost.
In some jurisdictions the registration gap is a limited problem because it is
standard practice to have a priority period whereby no other registration is allowed.
The transfer receives priority once it is registered within the appropriate time
period. This is the practice in England and Wales where there is a system of priority

searches4 and outline applications5 however Harpum has expressed the view that
these measures are “contrived and imperfect. . .also bureaucratic and add to the
costs of conveyancing”.6
In Ireland a priority search7 has the added advantage that when the registrar
issues the search he puts an inhibition on the folio.8 This inhibits all dealings for a
period of 44 days,9 save the dealing by the party on whose behalf the search was
made. Nothing can be registered after the search until registration of the transaction.
After the 44 days a further priority search may be applied for however, this does
not continue the previous period. This search is available to someone who has
contracted to buy the property or the lender who has lent money for the purchase.
In Ireland the paper application must be submitted within 44 days of completing
the eForm 17 (the electronic application form) and on average the application is
received within 10 days.10 The average time between the paper application being
lodged and registration of a full transfer of title where no queries arise is 10 days.11
Thus the time between the electronic application and lodgment for registration is
generally 10 days however it is impossible to determine the general time period
between completion of the transaction and registration. The eForm 17 may not be
completed until some considerable time after completion of the transaction. The
longer the time lag the greater the risk that some other intervening interest will gain
priority. This situation leaves B, Y and C open to risk.
As a result of the eDischarge system the registration gap has shortened some-
what but where the lender is not part of this system or the property needs to be
mapped, the registration gap in Ireland can extend into months or even years. There
is no requirement to register within a certain time limit.12
The risks for B, Y and C are that a prior encumbrance on the title has not been
cleared or due to the delay in registration some other intervening interest is
4 Cooke notes that where priority searches are used, the registered title is frozen and a purchaser
can proceed with conﬁdence as to the state of the register however overriding interests are not
frozen and the danger of them coming into being during the registration gap is a “signiﬁcant
hazard”. See Cooke (2003), p. 289.

searches.

9 The period was previously 21 days but this was deemed to be too short. It was extended to 44 days
by the Land Registration Rules 2012 (SI 483/2012). These rules also allow the application to be
made by electronic means and the intention of the Land Registry is to introduce an electronic
priority entry facility, as part of eRegistration, in the latter half of 2014.

Transfers of part take longer to process as these involve mapping changes and the opening of a new
folio. First registrations applications where there is a full investigation of the title also take longer.

registered land.

Registration Gap

registered. Loan monies have already been released by C but its interest is not yet
secured by registration of a charge on the title. If another charge takes priority, the
lenders charge cannot be registered as a ﬁrst legal charge. Similarly if another
interest is registered ahead of B and Y’s title then it will take priority.
Title registration relieves the duty of inquiry upon purchasers, in order to reduce transaction
costs; the priority rules that apply during the registration gap re-impose the duty. Purchasers
must either search for prior interests as if the land were unregistered, or assume the risk of
losing priority to an undiscovered prior interest during the registration gap. The loss will not
be compensated by the statutory indemnity scheme, unless it arises from a registry error or
omission such as an error in a search certiﬁcate.13
The reason for this danger period is as a result of the nature of the right held
by B, Y or C during the gap. It is not a registered right and thus must compete with
other unregistered rights for priority. Wylie expresses the view that the purchaser
has an equity to be registered as owner and has an unregistered right to the land
valid against his vendor and all other persons except a registered transferee for
value.14 This equity will survive against a volunteer but will be defeated by a
registered transaction for value.
This is supported by section 68(2) of the 1964 Act which provides that nothing in
the Act shall prevent a person from creating any right in or over any registered land
or registered charge, but all such rights shall be subject to the provisions of the Act
with respect to registered transfers of land or charges for valuable consideration.
Similarly section 68(3) provides that an unregistered right in or over registered
land, not being a section 72 burden, is not to affect the registered owner of a charge
created for valuable consideration.
Thus a transferees right or interest during the registration gap is vulnerable in
that it will be defeated if the transferor transfers to another party for value and that
second transfer is registered ﬁrst. The ﬁrst transferees unregistered right can only be
protected by a note on the folio or by a priority period.
In Coffey v. Brunel Construction Co. Ltd15 the defendant registered a lis pendens
as a burden pursuant to section 69 of the 1964 Act. This occurred after the plaintiffs
had purchased the land but before registration of their title. The plaintiffs were
registered subject to that burden and obtained an order from the High Court
directing the registrar to cancel the burden but the defendant appealed to the
Supreme Court. The Court held that the plaintiffs’ right arising from the contract
and payment of the purchase monies would not survive against the rights of a
registered transferee ‘but the defendants are not such’ or a charge for valuable
consideration ‘but a lis pendens is not such’. O’Higgins C.J. found that section
74 only related to the priority as between registered or unregistered burdens16 and
the plaintiffs’ right was not a “burden”. The plaintiffs held the entire beneﬁcial

estate in the lands from the time of the contract and the Court ordered that the
registration of the lis pendens be vacated.
During the registration gap B and C are at risk in the purchase of Greenacre and
Y is at risk in the transfer of Whiteacre. They are at risk from:
(a) T: the prior lender whose charge has not been discharged;
(b) U: the third party who wishes to protect their existing right in relation to the
land; and
(c) V: the property claimant who is successful in asserting a new right in relation to
the land.
6.2.1
Risk from T
Even in the most efﬁcient of conveyancing transactions there will be a slight delay
before the prior charge on the title is discharged. This delay can only be avoided if
the discharge is done in advance of or at the point of completion.
T will not want to provide a discharge in advance of completion unless it has
already been paid the redemption monies in full. This is unlikely to occur as the
redemption monies will form part of the purchase monies to be paid on completion.
Thus A will not be in a position to redeem the charge until the property has actually
been sold.17
The other option is that the discharge is done at the point of completion. In order
for this to occur three elements are required. Firstly that the redemption monies are
paid to T at that point; secondly that T is in a position to immediately discharge the
charge and thirdly the discharge is registered immediately.
Immediate Payment of Redemption Monies
In a typical Irish paper conveyancing transaction a bank draft or cheque is handed
over on completion and subsequently the transferor’s lawyer lodges this with the
prior lender in order to clear the prior charge on title. The obligation to lodge these
funds and clear the prior charge arises from an undertaking given to the transferee’s
lawyer on completion. The terms of the contract between the parties will also have
provided for an unencumbered title to be furnished on completion though, strictly
speaking, this is not possible unless the discharge is done simultaneously or in
advance.
Further delay may arise if the transferor is in negative equity and additional
monies need to be added to the purchase monies in order to clear the prior charge.
Also difﬁculties may arise in establishing the exact amount required to clear the

in a scheme of development however these fall outside the scope of this research.

181

prior charge and a discharge will prove impossible until the exact amount is
conﬁrmed and paid in full.
During this time period the acquisition lender C is at risk. Completion has taken
place and the purchase monies have been released by the transferee’s lawyer to the
transferor’s lawyer in order to purchase the property. Despite advancing the loan
funds, and those funds passing out of C’s control, C does not have a legal charge on
the title and will not have a ﬁrst legal charge until the prior charge is discharged in
full and its charge is registered.
B and Y are also at risk as they will not obtain unencumbered title until any prior
loan secured on the property is discharged. In particular B has paid over the
purchase monies in order to purchase Greenacre but Greenacre remains subject to
T’s charge. B has completed the purchase on foot of loan funds from C subject to
the requirement that C’s charge be registered on the title as a ﬁrst legal charge.
While A’s (the transferor’s) charge, held by T, remains on the title, B is unable to
comply with this requirement.
As a volunteer Y does not have a lender’s requirements to satisfy but Y would
ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to sell the property or to raise ﬁnance on it while the prior
charge remains on the title.
Provided the monies owned to T on foot of its charge have been paid in full, A
and X will have an equity of redemption.18 A and X would be in a position to call
for T to release the charge. However, if there is any dispute about the amount owed
or the redemption ﬁgure furnished for completion was incorrect, then it may take
some time for the discharge. Meanwhile T’s charge will remain registered against
the title.
The delay may provide the opportunity for some event to occur which prevents
the prior charge from being discharged. For example the prior charge might provide
cross security for monies advanced on other properties and the lender may refuse to
release the prior charge until those monies are repaid. The bank draft or cheque may
be lost or stolen or the funds may be misappropriated. If there are monies outstand-
ing which A and X refuse to pay then B and Y may be liable to dispossession and
sale of the property on the basis of A and X’s default.
A dispute about the amount to be repaid to order to obtain a discharge can be
avoided by obtaining accurate unequivocal redemption ﬁgures from the prior
lender. However, it is more difﬁcult to avoid the risk of negligence, theft or fraud.
In Ontario the usual practice is for the transferor’s lawyer to give the transferee’s
lawyer a statement of the amount owning on the mortgage as issued by the prior
lender, together with a direction by the transferor to his lawyer to pay that amount
directly to the prior lender and an undertaking by the transferor’s lawyer to obtain
and register the discharge.19 The Irish practice is also to rely on an undertaking by
the transferor’s lawyer.

are acquisition loans or the reﬁnancing of acquisition loans.

Thus in both jurisdictions the purchase monies are paid by the transferee’s
lawyer to the transferor’s lawyer and the transferor’s lawyer then redeems the
charge held by the prior lender. Both rely on the lawyer’s undertaking.20 It would
be more straightforward for the redemption monies to be paid directly by the
transferee to the prior lender with the balance of the monies paid to the transferor.
This system of undertaking has dangers associated with it21 including the risk of
lawyer fraud. Connolly notes that “elimination of the “registration gap” as a fraud
prevention tool in today’s climate has to be seriously considered.”22
The use of EFT has the potential to move the money faster and thus reduce part
of the gap. This means the money can transfer in hours or minutes rather than days.
Also an eConveyancing system provides the potential for the prior charge to be paid
off at the time of completion. In Ireland at the moment cheques and bank drafts are
typically taking 3–5 days to clear. EFT generally takes up to 24 h. Contrast this with
Ontario were the money can be transferred in a matter of minutes.
Ensuring that the money moves quicker will however only go some way towards
eliminating this risk. Paying the amount due on foot of the prior charge allows the
discharge to occur however a formal discharge must also take place and then this
must be registered with the registering authority.
Immediate Discharge of the Prior Charge
Once T has received the redemption monies it must be in a position to immediately
discharge the prior charge. In Ireland some moves have been made towards this
position with the launch of the eDischarge facility. Prior to the launch of this facility
a formal paper discharge could take 6–12 months to issue due to inefﬁciencies in
the lender’s process. The eDischarge facility now allows a lender to conﬁrm the
discharge of a charge directly with the registering authority via an electronic
message. Both the discharge and the registration of same are taking place within
1 month.
In the Ontario e-reg system registration of the discharge occurs as part of the
same application for registration of the transfer and new charge.
20 According to Law Society of Ireland (2013) an undertaking is any unequivocal declaration of
intention addressed to someone who reasonably places reliance on it which is made by a solicitor
in the course of his practice, either personally or by a member of the solicitor’s staff, whereby the
solicitor, or in the case of a member of his staff, his employer, becomes personally bound. See
paragraph 6.5.

6.2
Registration Gap
183

Simultaneous Registration of Discharge
Once the redemption monies are paid and the discharge issued then the discharge
must be registered with the registering authority. If all of these steps can occur
during completion then there is no risk of a prior charge remaining on title. B and Y
take unencumbered title and C can register a ﬁrst legal charge.
As noted already the eDischarge facility has considerably shortened the time
period between completion and registration of the discharge of the prior charge
however this time lacuna has not been eliminated entirely. Thus there remains a risk
to B, Y and C.
In both Ireland and Ontario staff in the registration authority must sign off on the
discharge and thus the registration is not simultaneous. However in the absence of
any problem with the application, registration of the discharge will be back dated to
the date of application.
Until the discharge is registered the new charge cannot be registered as a ﬁrst
legal charge leaving C exposed and both B and Y are exposed as they own a
property encumbered with a prior charge. Unless any prior charge on title can be
discharged in advance of, or simultaneously with completion of the sale, B, C and Y
remain exposed to risk.
A similar risk arises in relation to other prior encumbrances on the title register.
This might include a judgment mortgage that has not been paid. A wise transferee
will require that any such encumbrances are cleared from the title in advance of
completion so as to avoid the risk of their title being burdened.
In addition to interests on the register there may be others off the register that
create a risk during the registration gap. These overriding interests are dealt with
separately in Chap. 8.
Apart from these overriding interests there may be other interests that are not on
the title register but which make their way on to the register during the registration
gap. These interests are often called minor interests and they need to be registered to
be binding. This risk will arise from U the third party or V the property claimant.
During the registration gap an intervening interest held by U or V may be registered
and thus gain priority over the transaction.
6.2.2
Risk from U
During the registration gap there is a danger that some third party may act to protect
their existing right in relation to the land. An example would be someone with an
option to purchase or holding a contract for the same land.
This right will pose a risk to B and C in the purchase of Greenacre. If the right
was not disclosed by A and should have been under the terms of the contract, B may
have a case for breach of contract, misrepresentation, deceit or breach of covenant
184
6
Before Registration

of title.23 B may be able to rely on a number of different remedies such as
rescission, restitution or damages. If B was successful in applying to the Court
for an order of rescission the parties would be restored to their original position
before the contract was entered into. B would be entitled to recover not only the
deposit with interest but also any legal expenses incurred in investigating title. This
remedy is not available post completion.
The risk is that the interest held by U would be registered in advance of B and
C’s interest during the registration gap. The longer the gap the higher the likelihood
that U will register its right thus increasing the level of risk for B and C. If this
occurs B and C will lose priority to U. Thus B and C will be keen to have their
interests registered as soon as possible.
If U succeeds in having his interest registered ﬁrst the title of B will be subject to
such a right though, as already noted, B may have a remedy against A if the right
should have been disclosed and was not.
The registration gap will also increase the level of risk for C as the quality of its
security may be compromised. The value of the property may have decreased
though this will only have an impact if C is required to repossess and sell the
property. In Ireland the borrower B remains liable for the balance of the loan funds
even if the property sells for less than the amount due and thus in the long term C
may recover the shortfall anyway. Ideally C would recover all the loan funds plus
interest and penalties on a sale of the property but this is subject to market
conditions.
If the quality of C’s security is compromised C may have a remedy against B on
the basis that the right should have been discovered and disclosed by B or B’s
lawyer during the transaction.24 The chances of such an action being successful will
be strengthened if B or B’s lawyer did not carry out the appropriate enquires during
the transaction and as a result of this lack of enquiry U’s right remained
undiscovered.
Y is also at risk in the gift of Whiteacre. As a volunteer Y will not be in a position
to sue unless X gave guarantees that the property was not subject to such a right. As
Y is a volunteer and takes subject to all unregistered rights to which X held the land
he will not be concerned about prior unregistered rights. He takes subject to any
such right held by U regardless of whether or not his title is registered. Y will,
however, be concerned with new rights coming into existence during the registra-
tion gap. If this gap is reduced there is less opportunity for this new right to be
registered in advance of Y.
Any rights on the register would have come to light during the transaction so,
subject to any error of the registry in executing searches, the risk from U only arises
in relation to rights not already on the register. The registration gap has no effect on
23 Note that these risks to A are excluded from the remit of this research.

qualiﬁcations on title need to be disclosed to the lender in advance.

overriding interests as they will bind both transferor and transferee regardless of
when the transfer is registered.
6.2.3
Risk from V
During the registration gap there is the possibility of a new right being asserted in
relation to the land. As this is a new right that has matured since completion B will
likely have no remedy against A and C may not have a remedy against B. This is
subject to the right not having been granted by A or B.
This new right may be capable of protection by registration or by occupation or
some other factor and this protection may be secured during the registration gap. V
then becomes U a successful property claimant who is now the third party in the
schematic. For example V may have been successful in asserting a personal right
which the court ﬁnds is a property right during this period. Alternatively V may
have a right that becomes overriding through occupation. If the occupation is post-
completion but pre-registration then the registration gap could allow a new over-
riding interest to come into existence. This will be examined further in Chap. 8.
6.2.4
Removal of the Registration Gap
Is it possible to remove the registration gap entirely? Surely one element has to
occur ﬁrst. The possible combinations for sequencing in a paper environment are
listed in Table 6.1.
Completion encompasses closing of the transaction with the redemption of T’s
charge, discharge of that charge and registration of the discharge. This must take
place prior to the registration of the transaction from A to B and X to Y. Where
there is no prior charge on the title then the registration gap can automatically be
reduced as there is no necessity to wait for registration of the discharge. B and Y can
immediately apply to be registered as owner.
Sequences B, E and F do not occur because passing of the title by completion
has to occur before registration of the fact. The registration reﬂects the fact that
completion has already taken place. These two steps could however be amalgam-
ated whereby registration is completion. This is difﬁcult to achieve where staff in
the registering authority are required to sign off on the application before registra-
tion occurs.
There is also a difﬁculty with sequence D as the formalities for registration
often require that the money will already have changed hands i.e. the transfer will
acknowledge that the purchase monies have been paid. C also presents a difﬁculty
in that completion cannot be said to have occurred without the passing of the
purchase monies.
186

Before Registration

Thus most, if not all, jurisdictions including Ireland adopt sequence A. The
money generally changes hands at the same time as completion. It may also be paid
by B’s lawyer to A’s lawyer in advance on the understanding that it is held in trust
until completion. Completion then takes place followed by subsequent registration
of B’s title and C’s charge.
In Ontario the purchase monies are paid but are held in escrow pending com-
pletion and registration. In effect the money is paid, completion occurs and then
registration. So sequence A has not changed in this electronic environment.
Lawyers often separate in time and space the physical and ﬁnancial actions
associated with completion from the legal act of completion. By the use of escrow
and the holding of monies or documents on trust lawyers can co-ordinate the legal
act of completion so that the intent of the transaction is fulﬁlled at the right time.
Thus the legal act of completion is centred more on the status of the transaction than
on actual physical events that need to occur.
It would be almost impossible to design an eConveyancing system whereby the
money, completion and registration all occur simultaneously unless completion
became the fact of registration and at the same time as registration occurs the
money passes.25 Unless the ﬁnal sign off by the registering authority staff is
removed there will always remain at least a small registration gap in the convey-
ancing process. This is one reason why some jurisdictions have chosen to make
their systems both automated and automatic.
6.2.5
Effect of eConveyancing
The expectation is that eConveyancing will lead to a reduction of or perhaps even
removal of the registration gap. “Completion and registration will be completed
electronically, the main advantage here will be the removal of the ‘registration gap’
between completion and entry on the Register of the new owner, therefore
minimising the risk of conﬂicting or illegal rights”.26
This abolition of the registration gap would involve changes to the register
taking place at the same time as electronic completion of the transaction. In effect

this would be “completion by registration”.27 In an electronic system “the making
of a disposition and its registration, although in theory different acts, can in fact
occur simultaneously.”28 “The threefold process of execution, lodgement and
registration of deeds would be replaced by a single act of “execution electronically
by registration”.”29 This is entirely feasible in an electronic conveyancing system.
If the registration gap is removed in its entirety then completion will be simul-
taneous with registration.30 The power to transfer could be removed from the land
owner and given to the registrar so that only the registrar can alter title. This is
already feasible given that the physical act of execution may be separate from the
legal act of completion.
This would necessitate changes in Irish conveyancing practice particularly as the
discharge of the prior charge would need to be ready for registration at completion
and not done subsequently.
Title to Greenacre would pass from A to B and the change of ownership would
be registered at the same time. T’s prior charge would be paid and discharged and
registration of the discharge would occur also at the same time allowing C’s charge
to be registered on B’s title.
In the transfer of Whiteacre title would pass from X to Y. Any prior encum-
brance would also be discharged and registration of that discharge would occur
simultaneously.
In this scenario there would be no risk of a prior encumbrance on the title not
being cleared and left on the title after completion. There would be no risk from T
the prior lender. B and Y would obtain an unencumbered title and C’s charge would
be registered simultaneous with the release of the loan funds.
Removal of the registration gap also has an impact on the other risks identiﬁed.
If U, the third party or V, if a successful property claimant, have their right
registered before the registration of B then they gain priority as ﬁrst registered
prevails. This would not be possible if there is no registration gap. As a volunteer, Y
is subject to U and V’s right regardless of registration. If, however, V’s claim is not
successful then his property claim will fail and there is no risk to B, C or Y.
In ACC Bank plc v. Johnston31 Mr. Johnston was acting as solicitor for ACC
Bank. He released monies to the borrower’s solicitor on foot of an undertaking
given to him to the effect that the monies would be applied in the purchase of
speciﬁc properties and ACC Bank would have a ﬁrst legal charge over the lands. It
turned out that the borrower never owned the lands in question and thus the loan
could not be secured by a ﬁrst legal charge. The undertaking could not be honoured.

conveyancing transactions could be executed and ﬁled electronically (so as to have
immediate effect), then there is no reason in principle why all relevant conveyancing and
ﬁnancial transactions could not be executed as part of a single integrated programme. By
such a programme any existing mortgage could be released, the property could be trans-
ferred from the vendor to the purchaser, any appropriate mortgage in favour of a lending
institution to the purchaser could be put in place, and all necessary ﬁnancial transactions
associated with each of those aspects of the overall transaction could be executed. The risks
inherent in the existing system, which this case has brought into relief, could also be
removed by such a process. . ..then a fail safe method of conducting conveyancing trans-
actions where all elements of the transaction would take place simultaneously without,
indeed, the need for any of the parties to be in same place at the same time, could be put in
place.32
A contrary view is offered by Butt who asks if it is really that important to get rid
of this registration gap.
Are house buyers really attacking the gates of the Land Registry and demanding that the
registration gap be abolished? Do any of them actually know or care anything about it?
Surely, the most important thing must be to speed up the part of the conveyancing process
leading up to the client being able to move into his new home. . ..What happens after that
has never been of any concern to the client.33
This is because they assume the process is secure in their lack of knowledge of
it. However, if there is a problem with registration or some other intervening
interest is registered then it does become a major concern for the client. Perhaps
they may wish to sell on the following day or to raise additional ﬁnance using the
property as collateral and this is not feasible because of some event occurring
during the gap. Just because land owners are not aware of these risks does not mean
they do not exist and, if the opportunity arises to eliminate them, is it not incumbent
on other more knowledgeable stakeholders to assess the merits of such a reduction
in risk?
6.2.6
Impact on Risk
Thus removal or shortening of the registration gap does have an impact on risk.
Aligning payment of the purchase monies, completion and registration has the
potential to provide for:
(a)
simultaneous discharge of the prior charge—risk from T to B, Y and C is
removed; and
(b)
no delay in registration and thus no other intervening interest can be
registered—risk from U and V to B, Y and C is removed.
32 ACC Bank plc v. Johnston [2010] IEHC 236.
33 Butt (2006), p. 64.
6.2
Registration Gap
189

However the question arises as to whether this is feasible even in an electronic
environment particularly when the registering authority is required to sign off on
the registration.34 Even in Ontario the registration gap remains.
In Ontario if the land registrar decides that a proposed registration is in any way
deﬁcient he or she has 21 days to notify the lawyer that the application will be
rejected unless the deﬁciency is corrected.35 The registrar can allow a period of time
between seven and 30 days for the problem to be corrected and if the request is not
satisﬁed within that time frame then the application is rejected and priority is lost.36
If the matter is resolved within the time frame allowed then the registration will be
completed. The application will be deemed to have been registered on the day that
the registrar received it and in the order that the registrar entered it into the
register.37
Clancy expresses the view that “[e]ssentially, if the purchaser can rely absolutely
on the information contained in the register and can trust the solicitor and the
registration process, then there is no concern about a registration delay.”38 Unfor-
tunately none of these absolutes apply. The reality is much different.
In both jurisdictions the register is subject to some other right getting registered
in the registration gap and this right may not have been disclosed by the vendor, if
indeed it was known by him. If priority has not already been secured via a priority
period then there is the possibility of some other right gaining priority during the
delay. Even if a priority period is secured this is dependent on the application for
registration being successful. If for some reason the application is rejected then the
priority is lost.
There is also the risk from a prior encumbrance on the title that has not been
cleared. The example of the prior charge held by T is used above but this could be
some other encumbrance on the title. The lawyer may fraudulently appropriate the
funds and may not discharge the prior encumbrance in compliance with his or her
undertaking.
While it may not be feasible to eliminate the registration gap entirely, particu-
larly where the role of the registering authority is to be maintained, there is
considerable scope for its reduction in Ireland and this will lead to a lowering of
risk for B, C and Y. The extent of this decrease in risk will depend on how much the
gap can be reduced.
The impact of this lowering of risk for B, C and Y is that there may be increased
risk for U and V. U and V will have less or no time to get their interest registered or
protected by a note on the title register before the transaction takes effect. Thus the
34 In England the view has been taken that the registry must share its functions in order for the
registration gap to be eliminated. This argument was being used as the rationale for implementing
an automated and automatic eConveyancing system. See O’Connor (2003), p. 272.

possibility is that the B and C will take free from their interest. B will take free of
this interest as a bona ﬁde purchaser for value. C who holds a charge on B’s title will
also hold free of this interest.
Increasing the protection offered to those with what are perceived to be more
valid and valuable rights in land (in this case B and C) at the expense of U and V
may be seen as desirable and feasible in an eConveyancing environment.39 B and C
are market participants who rely on the register. Increasing the security of their
rights will enhance the ﬂuid operation of the land market and increase the potential
for investment and income generation. By contrast U and V rely not on the register
but on some other factor such as occupation or the status of their interest as an
overriding interest.
Even if the registration gap is removed or shortened an applicant for registration
will still need to comply with certain formalities for registration. This is the second
risk category pertaining to pre-registration. B will seek to have his title to Greenacre
registered subject to C’s charge and Y will seek to have his title to Whiteacre
registered. All must comply with the formalities for registration.
6.3
Formalities for Registration
B, Y and C are at risk if some other event or formality is required before registration
can take place. In a paper environment these risks might arise from a failure to
properly execute the deed or charge or the wrong form being used. The defect may
prevent registration taking place.
Harpum notes that in England a high degree of formality is required to create
proprietary rights.40 The formalities required for contracts and deeds relating to
land are strict and this is the position in all jurisdictions.41 Traditionally the
purchase of a family home was seen as the most expensive purchase a consumer
would make in their lifetime and thus, in order to protect this person, who was seen
to have little business acumen, a high degree of formality was required. This
formality also prevented a person from inadvertently parting with their interest in
property or creating new rights when they might not have intended to do so.
The formalities relate not just to the type of document that must be used but also
the format of that document and the execution thereof. In Ireland traditionally deeds
were handwritten on indented parchment or deed paper, signed and sealed with two
witnesses to each signature. With the advent of the typewriter, and then computers,
they could be typed on ordinary paper and the requirement for a seal was removed.
With the move to registered land the form was set by the registering authority,
39 See Sect. 9.4 for a more detailed analysis.

rather than by tradition, but signing and witnessing with wet signatures is still
required.
Thus the type of document and its format has changed signiﬁcantly over the
years. Registration of title required standard documents in a standard format and
this was backed by the statutory powers of the registering authority. The execution
had also changed in that sealing would no longer be required. Thus there has been a
continual change in the formalities for registration and eConveyancing has become
part of this continuum.
Any failure to comply with the formalities may create risk in that registration
may be denied. This will adversely affect B, Y and C. This failure to register may
lead to a loss of priority.
6.3.1
Risk in a Paper Environment
In a paper conveyancing environment there may be
(a) a valid deed, transfer or charge and registration is successful
(b) a valid deed, transfer or charge but registration is rejected
(c) an invalid deed, transfer or charge but registration is successful
(d) an invalid deed, transfer or charge and registration is rejected
If the registrar mistakenly rejects an application for registration of a valid deed,
transfer or charge, as per (b) above, then this is a registry error. The parties could
re-apply for registration or could seek rectiﬁcation and compensation under the
provisions outlined in Chap. 7. This mistake by the registry would extend the
registration gap and thus B, C and Y would be at risk for a longer period of an
intervening interest being registered ﬁrst and gaining priority. As there was a valid
deed, transfer or charge there has been no failure to comply with the formalities for
registration and, provided there is no error by the registry, registration should be
successful as per (a) above.
Where there is an invalid deed, transfer or charge there is a failure to comply
with the required formalities.42 If registration is successful, as per (c), this failure
might never come to light. If registration is rejected on the basis of the failure, as per
(d), the parties will need to resolve the difﬁculty before re-lodging the application
for registration. Meanwhile the registration gap is extended.
B may need to take an action against A to resolve the failure and similarly Y may
need to take an action against X. C would need to take action against B who granted
the charge. Such an action may be an in personam claim or on the basis of a breach
of the covenants of title. Alternatively as the sale of Greenacre is for value B would
be able to enforce the terms of the contract.
42 See Battersby (1998).

If registration had been successful and a subsequent sale to D had taken place B
and Y would no longer be at risk as they would have received the purchase monies
for their interest in the land and C’s charge would have been redeemed.
6.3.2
Changes in Formalities
In Ontario the requirement for a witness on a document was eliminated and most
afﬁdavits were replaced with law statements.43 In 1994 Part III of the LRRA was
introduced which provided for the electronic registration of electronic documents,44
known as e-reg. Section 22 provided that the electronic document will prevail over
any written document. Section 21 removed the requirement that a document be in
writing and signed and thus paved the way for electronic documents. Section 23
gave authority for the direct electronic transmission of electronic documents to the
title register database by authorised persons.45 These parties are applicants in the
neutral terminology as they do not alter the title register. In Ontario, as in Ireland,
only the registering authority can make a change to the title register though such a
change may be ordered by the Court.
The LRRA also introduced the concept of standardised forms known as
POLARIS forms. Implied covenants for transfers and charges and standard charge
terms were introduced. Lenders must ﬁle Charge Terms documents with the
registering authority and these terms are then incorporated by reference into the
standard forms. Copies of the Charge Terms are made available and a book of each
year’s Standard Charge Terms is published.46 This has meant a reduction in the
amount of paper stored in the registering authority and paper in the conveyancing
process. These initiatives “helped streamline the document registration process by
imposing consistency and simplifying the form and content of the documents that
were registered in the land registration system. . .[and] laid the groundwork for
automation and electronic registration.”47
Similar moves towards standardisation are occurring in Ireland. The 2009 Act
amended section 51(2) of the 1964 Act by deleting ‘or in such other form as may
appear to the Authority to be sufﬁcient to convey the land’.48 The discretion that
could be exercised by the registering authority was removed and now it can only
accept transfers of registered land in the prescribed form. More recently the Land

Registration Rules 201149 set out prescribed forms of charge that must be used from
the 1 March 2012.
Section 64 of the 2009 Act removed the sealing requirement and provided that
execution by an individual by signing and having their signature witnessed would
be sufﬁcient. However by virtue of section 10(1) of the Electronic Commerce Act
200050 deeds or transfers relating to real property cannot be in electronic form or
signed electronically and this would need to be amended before the implementation
of eConveyancing.51
Generally in an eConveyancing system the required formalities are translated
into business rules that need to be complied with. These business rules are reﬂected
in the data that needs to be put into the system. There is a common view that the
electronic system will reduce the possibility for errors as the electronic system will
prevent certain types of mistakes. Treacy and O’Sullivan note that “because of
in-built system prompts and automatic calculation of registration fees, use of the
on-line form completion is leading to a signiﬁcantly lower incidence of errors in the
documentation presented for registration.”52 These prompts ensure compliance
with pro-forma requirements however other errors would not be picked up by the
system, for example if the wrong form was used.
The system may ensure that the data input meets certain criteria and there is the
possibility for data ﬁelds to be checked against the title register before the applica-
tion is submitted. The data may be incorrect or the user may not have authority so
there is the possibility of the formalities for registration also not being complied
with in an electronic system. Rigid adherence to pro-forma requirements may also
generate other types of errors as the system may be too rigid to accommodate all
types of variation in transactions and may not reﬂect the actual agreement between
the land owners.
The use of an electronic platform does drive a need for conformity not just of the
required documentation but also of processes. It requires that transactions occur in a
prescribed way. Thus while there may be errors these may be of a limited variety.
Simpliﬁed forms may speed up registration by reducing the amount of material
that registering authority staff need to review in an application for registration. In
Ontario the forms were designed in conjunction with the automated system and in a
manner to compliment the screen design and automated workﬂow.53 This required
a reduction in the amount of information abstracted on to the register and resulted in
“increased productivity because of the standardized form and workﬂows and
improved data integrity with the simpliﬁed abstract entries.”54

The question arises though as to what, if anything, might be lost as a result of this
standardisation and reduction in information on the title register. Is the lack of
ﬂexibility creating invisible information leading to a consequential risk that will
only come to light at a later date? Harpum points out that in “an ideal world, each
and every formal requirement would be subjected to a detailed analysis to deter-
mine its precise functions.”55 This would likely reveal which formalities need to be
retained and which can be removed from the process.
The function of such formalities is to provide certainty and create a symbolic
representation of the important legal act taking place so the parties to that act will
think carefully before undertaking the act. In this way the parties will subsequently
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to claim that they did not understand the importance of the act and
the consequence ﬂowing from it. Youdan classiﬁes the functions of formality
provisions as ensuring intention, standardisation and evidence.56 Coughlan tracks
some of the changes in formalities that have occurred in Ireland while noting that
there is still a tendency towards a degree of formality which seems somewhat
outmoded.57
eConveyancing necessitates changes to the formalities required for the creation
and execution of deeds. It also requires change to be made to the common law
concept of ‘delivery’ of a deed, electronic signatures and authentication of the
electronic signature through certiﬁcation.58 Statutory authority is given to the
pressing of a computer key “setting off a digital reaction. . .. The pen succumbs to
the statutory sword.”59
Much of the change has centered around giving electronic documents validation
over paper documents and changes to execution requirements so that a wet signa-
ture is no longer required. In eConveyancing an electronic document must be given
the same as or preferential status to a paper document. Esigning without sealing
must be facilitated. The format will be more tightly prescribed so there is less scope
for inclusion of special clauses. Paper will be removed and this will mean the
elimination of interests that depended on deposit of the title deeds.60
The lawyer may need authority to sign on behalf of the client if the type of
electronic signature required is beyond the reach of clients. Supporting transac-
tional documentation and the client authority may still exist off the register. These
will be required to overcome any later difﬁculty with providing evidential proof of
what the client authorised the lawyer to do on his or her behalf. This necessity to
retain paper on the lawyers ﬁle appears to defeat one of the overall tenets of
55 Harpum (2000), p. 9.

eConveyancing which is dematerialisation. However this can be overcome by
developing digital signature solutions for land owners.
The potential conﬂict between paper evidence and electronic evidence of title
and the fear that land owners might prefer the paper document to the electronic
record probably encourages the move towards abolition of paper. As Kelway states
“[i]f we are to move to a fully electronic service there cannot be a paper-based end
product.”61 Lenders have generally welcomed this as the storage of paper records
has become an expensive waste of space.62 The retention of some paper may
however be a necessity until all clients have an electronic signature that is robust
enough to be used in the system.
While dematerialisation is an important tenet of eConveyancing it is really the
knock on effect that is of interest. There may be savings in the registering authority
due to efﬁciency of staff time, a reduction in data input, lowering of cost of paper
storage and archiving and less investigation of title required as there is no need to
review bundles of paper deeds. The same savings will occur in the lawyer’s ofﬁce.
There may thus be a reduction in costs that can be passed on to the land owner.
In Ontario each electronic document statement conﬁrms that the person signing
has the authority to sign on behalf of the owner. The electronic signature is attached
by the lawyer and not the land owner. These new requirements have shifted
authority and compliance to the lawyer. This would suggest that it is easier for a
transaction to be done without a land owner’s presence, knowledge or consent. Do
electronic signatures attached by the lawyer give the land owner a degree of
abstraction or disassociation from the transaction and if so, what impact does this
have? Is a land owner, be they transferor or transferee, more likely to repudiate the
transaction as a result?
These enquiries could be seen in the context of risks that arise in all computer
systems as they are not particular to eConveyancing. However, as the degree of
formality associated with a paper conveyancing system is so high any perceived
lowering or diluting of these formalities is generally greeted with horror. The
question arises as to whether this is attitude is justiﬁed.
Clearly it would be preferable for a land owner to have the electronic signature
as it is their transaction. It would also be preferable for them to make all statements
about the title however these requirements may need to be traded for the other
beneﬁts that can accrue from eConveyancing.
Given that standardisation is a key requirement it is likely that the formalities
will be streamlined and regardless of whether the system is paper or electronic there
may be a breach of formalities. If such formalities are more clear and streamlined a
breach may be less rather than more likely to occur.

6.3.3
Risk in an eConveyancing Environment
In an eConveyancing environment if the transfer or charge and registration is a
simultaneous act a failure, of any type, is a complete failure. In Howell’s view
either a disposition is registered and takes full effect, or it is not and has no effect at
all.63 This means that under eConveyancing there can be no failure in formality as a
transfer will either be registered or not.64
The schematic would need to be adjusted to indicate that the transfer or charge
could not occur independently of its registration. It is the act of registration that is
the key rather than the instrument. There may in fact be no instrument but instead
registration will be based on the completion of data ﬁelds that comply with the
information already on the title register, the application of an electronic signature
and the click of a computer key to indicate completion of the transaction.
Making completion and registration a simultaneous act is, however, the charac-
teristic of an automatic system where the registrant triggers the change in the title
register without intervention by the registering authority. This is not the system
adopted in Ontario and Ireland also proposes that the registering authority would
retain the ﬁnal approval of any application for registration.
In Ontario the documents may be returned by the registrar for corrections and the
lawyer has 30 days to correct the problem and relodge the document.65 Thus while
the instrument may have been tendered for registration and the transaction com-
pleted based on its electronic transmission to the registrar via Teraview, until the
instrument is checked, certiﬁed and entered on the register, it is not registered and
has no effect.66
Donahue and his colleagues note that despite the risks
current practice is to complete purchases and mortgage advances just as one would do
under the [unregistered] Registry system and not await the certiﬁcation of the instrument.
This approach is taken in spite of the provisions in s. 78(2), which allows the land registrar
to decline the registration of a document within 21 days after it was received where the land
registrar decides that the document contains an error, omission or deﬁciency.67
However, even if completion and registration are not to be done simultaneously
and the power of the registering authority is to be retained, it should be possible in
an eConveyancing environment to reduce the registration gap to such an extent that
registration follows completion almost automatically. This should certainly be
feasible for straightforward transfers and charges where there is no subdivision.
Retaining a time gap, though however small, means there is always the danger
that the formalities may not be complied with and an application for registration

might be rejected. Thus on the face of it there is no change in risk to B, Y or C
through the move to eConveyancing.
If, however, the system requires a right to be registered in order for title to be
conferred then a failure to register due to non-compliance with the formalities may
have serious adverse consequences. If the move towards eConveyancing involves a
transition from title registration to title by registration then the formalities for
registration become more important. Standardised forms and workﬂow may make
it easier to comply with the formalities and to meet the business rules but the
consequence of non compliance will be more severe. Failure to register will result
in the right not being enforceable. The register will not only mirror the title but will
be the entire source of title to the property.68
Given that Ireland already operates a title by registration system it is possible
that the changes in formality brought about by standardisation and demateria-
lisation will result in a more streamlined, efﬁcient and cost effective conveyancing
process. In built system prompts are likely to reduce the risk of a breach of
formalities occurring though this may need to be balanced against any rigidity
introduced if there is a lack of ﬂexibility in the system.
If the system design is robust it presents the opportunity to build in less risk
for B, Y and C. It may make it easier for them to comply with the registering
authority requirements. As the formalities are translated into business rules the
system may indicate if there is a problem with the data. If data is pre-populated
from the title register then there is less possibility of getting the name of the
transferor or property identiﬁer wrong. Errors may be identiﬁed and resolved in
advance of completion so that there is less likelihood of the application for
registration being rejected. The system may also show in advance what effect a
successful application will have on the title register so the applicant can be sure the
application will effectively implement the transaction.
Conclusion
The implementation of eConveyancing is likely to impact on the risk proﬁle
of certain participants as a result of changes occurring in the pre-registration
period.
eConveyancing in Ireland will not eliminate the registration gap but has
the potential to reduce it. The remaining gap may be covered by a priority
period. Reducing the registration gap lowers risk for B, Y and C and increases
risk for U and V. This is likely to be seen as a desirable outcome and U and V
are unlikely to be protected against this change.

Before Registration

In relation to changes to the formalities for registration there may be the
opportunity to further reduce the risk for B, Y and C. This will not lead
directly to a corresponding increase in risk for other parties.69
Thus eConveyancing will beneﬁt those applying for registered title at
the expense of third party rights. B, Y and C’s title will be registered more
promptly and more easily however these changes will not entirely eliminate
risk for B, Y and C. Given the increased emphasis on registration the effect of
an error in the register may be more severe and this risk is examined in the
next chapter.

The Register
7.1
Introduction
This chapter examines the impact of the register itself. On the face of it the land
owner has made a successful application for registration but due to some error in the
transaction or by the registering authority their interest is at risk.
All parties are at risk from an error in the register. Due to the error A’s ownership
of Greenacre and X’s ownership of Whiteacre may be at risk from a claim of prior
ownership. If this occurs B is at risk in the purchase of Greenacre and Y is at risk in
the transfer of Whiteacre. They are at risk from the fact that A and X did not have
title to sell or gift. C is also at risk in the purchase of Greenacre as B did not have
title to grant the charge. D may also be at risk if a subsequent transaction has
occurred.
This chapter will examine where the error occurs in the modeled transactions so
that B and Y are subject to a claim of prior ownership by A and X.
The unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the title register could occur due to
an action by a person who is not entitled to act at all, an action by a person who is
entitled to act but not in the actual circumstances or alternatively due to an error
made by the registering authority. An entry on the title register might have been
allowed when it should not have been or alternatively the title register is not
amended when it should have been. Alternatively the error might involve amending
the wrong entry on the title register. The registering authority may fail to register
the interest correctly or at all.
Cooke makes the distinction between transactional errors and register errors.1
Transactional errors being where the transfer is void and thus should not have been
registered; its registration is an error. Alternatively there may be an administrative
mistake where the transaction is ﬁne but the process of registration produces an
error. Register errors occur where the register is wrong before the transaction takes

place i.e. there was an error on ﬁrst registration of the title or because a prior
transfer was void and should not have been registered.2
A transactional error may be capable of being corrected by the parties to the
transaction, though there may be no incentive to do so if the transfer has success-
fully been registered. A transactional error that is not corrected may become a
register error in subsequent transactions. This distinction by Cooke is primarily
about which transaction has created the error i.e. the current transaction or a prior
transaction.
How errors are dealt with by registration systems has, however, less to do with
the transaction that created the error and more to do with the speciﬁc type of error.
The exception is in the case of fraud where the person buying from the fraudster
may be treated differently to a subsequent purchaser and this is examined later in
the chapter.
The terms transaction errors and registry errors are used below but with a
different meaning. Transaction errors are those errors that arise outside the regis-
tering authority. Registry errors refer to errors that originate in the registering
authority. These errors arise purely due to some mistake by the registering authority
and are not based on some fault in the transaction. For example staff in the
registering authority amend the wrong entry or the title register is not amended
when it should have been.
Where there is a fault in the transaction and as a result the application for
registration should have been rejected but was not, this will be referred to as a
combined transaction and registry error. The entry was allowed by the registering
authority when it should not have been. Such errors present a danger to the
participants in that the transaction may have been void or voidable for any one of
a number of reasons. The transfer may have been forged or there may have been
some fraudulent misrepresentation, illegality or breach of statutory duty.3
Thus the types of errors can be divided under the following headings:
1. Transaction errors
2. Registry errors4
3. Combined transaction and registry errors
Transaction errors that do not result in a registry error fall outside the remit of
this examination.5 If the error occurred prior to lodgement of the application or in
the preparation of an application then the rectiﬁcation is a matter for the parties
affected.6 This may mean that a deed of rectiﬁcation is required or the parties may
need to dispute the matter in Court.

4 The examination is limited to errors in the title register.
5 Examples include where the wrong purchase monies are stated or the transferee transfers in the
wrong capacity e.g. as personal representative and not as beneﬁcial owner.

The Register

Also registry and combined errors of a minor nature are peripheral to this
research. This may include where there is a mapping error or a name is spelt
wrong on the register. The major risk arising from a registry error or combined
error is where a party to the system loses title by being dispossessed and it is this
risk that is examined in detail.
The most severe consequences for the idealised participants will be where the
system allows rectiﬁcation of the register, based on the error, and this adversely
affects the party in question by dispossessing them. This party may be B, C, Y or
D. Equally if the system does not allow rectiﬁcation and upholds the register then
some other idealised participant may be dispossessed instead. This would be A or
X. The consequences of rectiﬁcation will always be severe either for one party or
another. It may be the party who would be, or have become, the ‘owner’ if not for
the error i.e. B, C, Y or D. Alternatively it may be the ‘registered owner’ who should
not have become so i.e. B, C or Y or the subsequent transferee D who relied on the
error.
As our abstracted ‘pure’ participants act correctly at all times the focus is on
when such an alteration or correction of the error is due to the fault of someone else
or the registering authority. The error could be corrected by rectiﬁcation or the
system may provide for compensation to be paid to the injured party. Ruoff and his
colleagues refer to these as complementary remedies7 but in many instances both
rectiﬁcation and the lack thereof may lead to a claim for compensation though the
claimants will differ.
Rectiﬁcation may be the remedy for an error in the title register or alternatively
indefeasibility may mean that the title register is immune from rectiﬁcation. Where
rectiﬁcation is refused on the grounds of indefeasibility the registration system may
provide for compensation to be paid. Compensation may also be payable if a person
suffers loss due to a title being rectiﬁed when they have relied upon the erroneous
registry entry. Such rectiﬁcation arises on the grounds of defeasibility of the title
register.
Thus the extent to which the system of registration is defeasible will determine
whose interest is to be upheld as being guaranteed by the state and whose ownership
is to be displaced by the error. Such displacement may have already taken place by
virtue of the error and the system may let the error stand. Alternatively the title
register may be rectiﬁed and this may trigger a claim for compensation.
Using the schematic the impact of combined errors and registry errors are
examined in the context of both Ireland and Ontario. A number of possible
scenarios arise which demonstrate the risk.

Introduction

7.2
Risk from Combined Transaction and Registry Errors
The impact of a fraudulent transaction provides the clearest demonstration of how a
transaction error becomes a registry error. Where the transfers to B and Y are based
on fraud the schematic presents a number of different scenarios. Each scenario pits
one or more participants against other participants.
Scenario 1 examines where a fraudulent transaction takes place in the transac-
tion for value.
Scenario 1(a)
A fraudster steals A’s identity in order to sell Greenacre to B and B becomes
the registered owner on foot of the fraudulent transaction. In this situation A
is an innocent prior registered owner. When A becomes aware of the transfer
he seeks to have the register rectiﬁed to restore his title. This would only be
possible where the charge held by T had already been paid and removed from
the register however the transaction would have been ﬁnanced by C whose
interest is now at risk.
If the register is rectiﬁed in favour of A, then B and C lose title. If the
register is not rectiﬁed and the interests of B and C are upheld then A loses
title.
Scenario 1(b)
Before A became aware of the fraud, B sold Greenacre to D and D is now the
registered owner. In this situation A is an innocent prior registered owner but
D purchased in reliance on the register. A seeks to have the register rectiﬁed
in his favour while D resists the rectiﬁcation and requires his ownership to be
upheld. D may have purchased on foot of ﬁnancing provided by a lender and
this acquisition lender will be called ‘C2’.
The register could be rectiﬁed in favour of A so that D and C2 lose title.
Alternatively the ownership of D and C2 could be upheld so that A loses title.
Scenario 2 examines where a fraudulent transaction takes place in the transac-
tion not for value.
Scenario 2(a)
A fraudster steals X’s identity in order to gift Whiteacre to Y and Y becomes
the registered owner on foot of the fraudulent transaction. In this situation X
is an innocent prior registered owner. When X becomes aware of the transfer
he seeks to have the register rectiﬁed to restore his title.
(continued)
204
7
The Register

The register could be rectiﬁed in favour of X so that Y loses title.
Alternatively if the register is not rectiﬁed and the ownership of Y is upheld,
X loses title.
Scenario 2(b)
Before X became aware of the fraud, Y sold Whiteacre to D and D is now the
registered owner. In this situation X is an innocent prior registered owner but
D purchased in reliance on the register. X seeks to have the register rectiﬁed
in his favour while D resists the rectiﬁcation and requires his ownership to be
upheld. Again D may have purchased on foot of ﬁnancing provided by a
lender and this acquisition lender will be referred to as ‘C2’.
The register could be rectiﬁed in favour of X so that D and C2 lose title.
Alternatively the ownership of D and C2 could be upheld so that X loses title.
7.3
Risk from Registry Errors
A registry error originates in the registry and as a result a party is in danger of being
dispossessed. Where such errors occur the schematic presents a number of other
different scenarios.
In order to examine these, additional parties need to be introduced to the
schematic. These will be the stranger ‘S’ and the stranger’s lender ‘SL’. D will
remain the subsequent bona ﬁde purchaser for value and C2 will be D’s acquisition
lender.
Scenario 3 examines where the error takes place in the transaction for value.
Scenario 3(a)
Instead of registering the title to Greenacre in B’s name subject to the charge
held by C, the registrar registers S as the owner and SL as the lender. When B
and C become aware of the error they seek to have the register rectiﬁed.
Scenario 3(b)
Before B and C become aware of the error, S sold the property to D who has
purchased in reliance on the error in the register. If D purchased using loan
funds then C2 will also be at risk.
Scenario 4 examines where the error takes place in the transaction not for value.
7.3
Risk from Registry Errors
205

Scenario 4(a)
Instead of registering the title to Whiteacre in Y’s name, the registrar registers
S as the owner. When Y becomes aware of the error he seeks to have the
register rectiﬁed.
Scenario 4(b)
Before Y became aware of the error, S sold the property to D who has
purchased in reliance on the error in the register. If D purchased using loan
funds then C2 will also be at risk.
Thus in total there are four possible scenarios and each has two elements. Part
(a) deals with the position where the erroneous transaction or registration has been
entered on the title register and part (b) examines the position of the parties after a
subsequent transaction has been registered. The idealised participants have been
used above to demonstrate the error in question and each scenario will be examined
to determine how the error is addressed by the registration systems in Ireland and
Ontario.
As already stated the extent to which each system is defeasible will determine
whether the error will lead to rectiﬁcation or an upholding of the register. Either
may then trigger a claim for compensation from a participant who has suffered loss.
Before applying these scenarios it is necessary to explain the position in general
in each jurisdiction and also the law on rectiﬁcation and compensation.
7.4
The Position in Ireland
Much of the Irish case law on rectiﬁcation of the register arises in relation to the
provisions of the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act 1891 (the 1891 Act)
rather than under the current provisions of the 1964 Act.8 This is explained by two
factors. Firstly it could be argued that the 1891 Act allowed rectiﬁcation in a
broader set of circumstances. Section 34(2) referred to errors occurring in the
registration of the ownership of land whereas section 32(1) of the 1964 Act is
limited to errors originating in the Land Registry.9 Secondly under the 1891 Act
8 See Dowling (1993), pp. 113–129 for an examination of these cases. See also chapter IX,
McAllister (1973).
9 Conﬁrmed by Carroll J. in Geraghty v. Buckley High Court Unreported (6 October 1986). Though
the Supreme Court in Persian Properties Ltd v. The Registrar of Titles and the Minister for
Finance [2003] IESC 12 held that the fact that the initial application to the Land Registry
contained an inaccuracy did not relieve the defendants of their obligation to pay compensation
to the plaintiff pursuant to section 120(2) since the error in registration had not been caused, or
substantially contributed to, by the plaintiff.
206

The Register

only the court had power to rectify and thus any act of rectiﬁcation is in the public
domain and is accompanied by a court decision setting out the reasons for the
rectiﬁcation.
This is contrasted with the position post the 1964 Act where decisions of the
registrar to rectify under the provisions of section 32 remain hidden as they are not
made public.10 There is an argument that, as this rectiﬁcation is based on consent, it
should remain a private agreement between the parties. The counter argument is
that because the error was on the part of the registry and may form grounds for
compensation public policy dictates that such decisions be made publicly available.
Given however that the decisions of the registrar are not available there is in fact
very little modern case law that provides guidance in this area. In re Erris Invest-
ments Ltd.11 a lease was disclaimed by a liquidator of a tenant company and the
landlord sought its cancellation as a burden on his title. The registrar refused
rectiﬁcation and the court agreed. In Boyle v. Connaughton12 the court ordered
rectiﬁcation of the register on the basis that the plaintiff was aware of the defen-
dant’s actual occupation of part of his land before the transfer and thus the
plaintiff’s title was subject to that overriding interest. Notwithstanding the conclu-
siveness of the register the rights held by the Connaughtons were preserved and
protected by section 72 of the 1964 Act by their actual occupation. In addition a
mistake in mapping was made when the original lands were subdivided so that the
intention of the transfer was not given effect to. The maps were amended to more
accurately reﬂect the position of both properties on the ground.
The case of Crumlish v. Registrar of Deeds and Titles13 is of more interest as the
same piece of land was sold twice and then the two transfers were by mistake
registered in two different folios. Giving priority to the transfer that was lodged for
registration ﬁrst, the registrar sought to rectify the error by cancelling the second
transfer to the applicant. Lynch J. in the High Court held that the registrar only had
power to rectify with the consent of the parties and the applicant in this case had
speciﬁcally refused consent. The court would not make an order on the basis of
proceedings by way of judicial review heard only on afﬁdavit. Unfortunately there
is no further public record of how this dispute was ultimately resolved.
The lack of judicial guidance means that it is a matter for speculation as to
exactly how the Irish courts might approach certain aspects of indefeasibility.
However, the power of the registrar to rectify with consent means that often
insigniﬁcant practical changes to the register can be accomplished without an
application to court. Of course, signiﬁcant changes could also be made provided
there is consent.
10 Deeney (2014), pp. 347–348 does make reference to some related case law but these decisions
are not publicly available and shed little light on the core issue.

7.4
The Position in Ireland
207

If the registrar discovers an error he may enter an inhibition on the folio in order
to freeze the folio and thus protect the fund in the event of a claim.14 This power
must be exercised in a judicial manner and, unless the urgency of the situation
requires otherwise, prior notice should be given to any person whose rights may be
affected.15 The registrar would not be permitted to freeze the folio indeﬁnitely as
this would make the land inalienable. The inhibition may be a prelude to a
consensual change by rectiﬁcation or the matter being decided in court in favour
of one party or the other.
7.4.1
Rectiﬁcation
Sections 31 and 32 of the 1964 Act set out the grounds for rectiﬁcation of the
register in Ireland.
Section 32(1)16 provides that any errors originating in the Land Registry may be
rectiﬁed by
(a) the Authority with the consent of the registered owner and all interested parties
upon such terms as may be agreed in writing by the parties; or
(b) the Authority where it is of the opinion that the error can be rectiﬁed without
loss to any person after giving such notices as may be prescribed; or
(c) the court upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just, if of the
opinion that the error can be rectiﬁed without injustice to any person.
The error can be one of misstatement, misdescription, omission or otherwise
whether in a register or registry map.17
Thus the registrar can only rectify errors originating in the registering authority
with the consent and written agreement of the relevant parties or, having notiﬁed
the parties, if the rectiﬁcation is without loss to any person. This severely limits the
power of the registrar to rectify the register. Equally the court can only rectify the
error under section 32 if there would be no injustice caused to any person.
“Presumably this would imply that the court would not upset the registration of a
registered owner who was registered on foot of a transfer for value and who
purchased the lands in good faith.”18
14 Section 121 of the 1964 Act.
15 The State (Christopher Philpott) v. The Registrar of Titles [1986] ILRM 499. Gannon J. also
stated that this measure should only be used to protect the fund from a real probability of a claim
for compensation and should relate to an identiﬁable error made in the registry of a nature for
which compensation could be payable in accordance with section 120.

The Register

The role of the registrar is in effect to mediate an agreement between the parties
so as to facilitate rectiﬁcation with consent. Such rectiﬁcation may then give rise to
a claim for compensation which will be adjudicated by the registrar. Fitzgerald
points out that the hearing of compensation claims by the registrar “places him in an
invidious situation and this provision in the Act has been the subject of criticism.”19
The court also has power to rectify under section 31 in the case of actual fraud or
mistake and this can be on such terms as it thinks just. This does not mean that no
party will suffer loss or be prejudiced by the court’s decision. Instead the availabil-
ity of compensation may mean that the court’s decision is equitable.20 Section 32
contains a statutory power to rectify whereas section 31 sets out the breadth of the
court’s equitable jurisdiction to rectify for reasons falling outside section 32.21
In the recent case of Stepstone Mortgage Funding Ltd v. Tyrrell22 the High Court
ordered the registrar to reinstate rights of way on a folio which had been cancelled
without notice to all parties with an interest in the land. The plaintiff had a copy
folio showing the rights which appeared on the register at the time the charge was
granted and thus was entitled to rely on the conclusivity of the register. The court
referred to the fact that the plaintiff, as a chargee for value, did not have to penetrate
the “Iron Curtain” of the register.23
Thus the court has broad powers of rectiﬁcation while the registrar can only
rectify errors originating in the registering authority.24 Fitzgerald notes that “no
such correction or alteration [by the registrar] would of course disturb registered
and legal interests”25 presumably on the basis that anyone holding such interests
would not give their consent to a rectiﬁcation that would deprive them of their
interest. This is conﬁrmed by the registering authority in a practice direction which
states that no correction could, of course, be made which would disturb registered
legal interests.26 In Geraghty v. Buckley27 Carroll J. noted that since the registrar
did not have power to transfer land unilaterally, the only way title could be
transferred, in the absence of the registration of a transfer by the registered
owner, was by order of the court.

23 This is a phrase used by McAllister. See McAllister (1973).
24 Thus the registrar’s rectiﬁcation is limited to errors in the registration process and excludes the
possibility of correcting errors in the document presented for registration. See Deeney
(2014), p. 341.

7.4
The Position in Ireland
209

Fitzgerald notes factors that will be considered by the Court such as:
(a) whether or not the registered owner contributed to the error28
(b) that he could have had the error rectiﬁed previously
(c) that he was a volunteer and his title could have been defective
(d) that there was fraud; however where the purchaser for value then sells on the
property his purchaser would get a good title and rectiﬁcation would not be
possible.29
This implies that the fraudulent transaction would not be upheld but that a
subsequent transaction to a bona ﬁde purchaser for value would be guaranteed.
McAllister expresses the view that if there is a fraud the register will be rectiﬁed
against the fraudster and any person claiming through or under the fraudster as
volunteers but that if there is a transfer by the fraudster to a purchaser for value then
the transfer cannot be set aside.30 He relies on English case law for this stance31 and
notes the lack of reported Irish cases dealing with rectiﬁcation of the register on the
grounds of actual fraud.32
Thus McAllister is of the view that the fraudulent transaction will not be set
aside unless it is to a volunteer whereas Fitzgerald implies that the fraudulent
transaction will be set aside unless there is a subsequent transaction. Given that
both Fitzgerald33 and McAllister34 were registrars their comments are of consider-
able interest. If the fraudster has transferred registered title to himself then the
register would obviously be rectiﬁed in favour of the innocent prior registered
owner. The difﬁculty arises when the fraudster has transferred title to anther party
(B or Y in the schematic) and this difﬁculty is compounded when B or Y have sold
to D. Whose title is to be upheld?
In effect the issue has yet to be settled but on principle McAllister leans in favour
of immediate indefeasibility noting that in order to overcome this “it would be
necessary to show a mala ﬁdes on the part of the purchaser (short of actual fraud)
which would tip the scales of justice against him and in favour of another claim-
ant.”35 This contrasts with Fitzgerald’s comments which imply a policy of deferred
indefeasibility.
28 Section 120(2) refers to the loss not being caused or substantially contributed to by the act,
neglect or default of the person or his agent. This was argued in Persian Properties Ltd v. The
Registrar of Titles and the Minister for Finance [2003] IESC 12 but Keane C.J. found this
submission was not well founded.

The Register

Section 32(1) uses the word ‘may’ and thus the registrar has a general discretion
to refuse rectiﬁcation. Deeney, former Deputy Registrar, in a more recent work, is
of the view that where a transferee for value is registered prior to discovery of the
error, such error is not capable of rectiﬁcation, and the remedy is a claim for
compensation.36 He also expresses the view that a fraudulent transfer to a party to
the fraud or a volunteer would be set aside but any transfer for value cannot be set
aside.37 He does not distinguish between an immediate transaction or a deferred
transaction but implies that no transaction or charge for value would be set aside. In
support of this he quotes Glover as follows:
If a registration has been made under a fraudulent disposition, the disposition can only be
set aside as against parties and privies to the fraud, and volunteers claiming under them; it
cannot be set aside as against a registered transferee for value, or a registered chargee for
value, claiming under a party to the fraud.38
Thus like McAllister, Deeney leans in favour of immediate indefeasibility.
The High Court case of Moore v. Moore39 is of interest. The ﬁrst two defendants
sold the property to the third defendant on the basis that they believed the plaintiff
to have predeceased their father and that he was the sole owner of the property as
surviving joint tenant. The third defendant became the registered owner and took
out a charge on the property. The plaintiff alleged fraud on the basis that the ﬁrst
two defendants relied on a death certiﬁcate of someone with the same name as the
plaintiff however the court found that there was no evidence of fraud or conceal-
ment as the ﬁrst two defendants did attempt to ascertain the whereabouts of the
plaintiff. Murphy J. held that the register is conclusive evidence of title and if the
plaintiff sustained loss as a result of fraud then she would be entitled to compen-
sation under the provisions of section 120. She was not entitled to rectiﬁcation in
circumstances where the third named defendant was a bona ﬁde purchaser for value
without notice of the alleged fraud. Also the charge holder was a bona ﬁde
purchaser for value without notice.
In this case there was no originating error by the registry. It relied upon an
afﬁdavit sworn by the ﬁrst and second named defendants to put the property into the
sole name of their father and they then sold to the third named defendant as personal
representatives. The court could have rectiﬁed under section 31 on the basis of
mistake but chose not to do so. There had been a transfer and charge to bona ﬁde
parties without notice. The court refused the plaintiff’s claim as against the third
named defendant.
This case is more consistent with a policy of deferred indefeasibility however the
Irish Supreme Court has yet to issue a seminal judgment on the exact nature of Irish
indefeasibility so the issue remains to be settled.40

7.4.2
Compensation
One of the deﬁning features of the title register is the state guarantee of title
underpinned by a compensation fund. If any of the parties suffer a loss as a result
of an error in the register they may be entitled to compensation from the govern-
ment. This compensation is intended to put them as far as possible in the position
they would have been in had they not been deprived of the interest.
Compensation is payable under section 12041 of the 1964 Act to a person
adversely affected by a rectiﬁcation who suffers loss provided the loss was not
caused or substantially contributed to by the act, neglect or default of that person or
his or her agent.42 Section 120 provides the grounds to claim compensation for
error, forgery or fraud in relation to registration. The ﬁve grounds of loss which can
lead to a claim for compensation are:
(a) loss must arise from the rectiﬁcation of an error in registration under section 32
(1);
(b) any error originating in the registry which is not rectiﬁed;
(c) any entry in or omission caused or obtained by forgery or fraud;
(d) an error in an ofﬁcial search; or
(e) the inaccuracy of any extract from the register.
The error originating in the registry may be a misstatement, misdescription,
omission or otherwise.
Previously the claimant was required to show that he had exhausted all other
avenues before he would be entitled to compensation. The case law that provided
for this was according to McAllister “obviously absurd and largely negatives the
notion of a State guaranteed title.”43 The Land Registry practice direction however
conﬁrms that this position was overruled by the Supreme Court in 1982.44 This was
conﬁrmed by the Supreme Court in Persian Properties Ltd v. The Registrar of Titles
and the Minister for Finance.45 Keane C.J. held that a submission by the plaintiff
that it was obliged to resist a claim to a strip of disputed ground and engage in
expensive litigation in the High Court before applying to the defendants for
compensation was wholly unsustainable. He could not see any basis on which the
registrar could have required the plaintiff developers to engage in such expensive
and unnecessary litigation. Reimbursement of the costs of taking or defending legal
proceedings does not depend on the consent of the registering authority but will
depend on the circumstances of each case.
41 As amended by section 69 of the 2006 Act.
42 Deeney refers to this as a clear restriction on the right to compensation. See Deeney (2014),
p. 347. See also p. 348 for relevant case law.

The Register

It is not just the person adversely affected who is entitled to compensation but
also any person deriving title from him or her.46 If the loss arises from rectiﬁcation
of an error originating in the registry then the applicants’ costs and expenses in
obtaining the rectiﬁcation are also covered.47 The time limit for claiming under the
section is 6 years from the time when the right to compensation accrued.48
Since the compensation is paid by the state,49 section 120(6) provides that the
Minister for Finance shall then be able to recover the amount from the person who
caused or derived advantage from the loss. No such compensation has ever been
recovered from any person.50 This may be because there has been no signiﬁcant
compensation claim against the register. There has also been no rectiﬁcation of the
register or compensation paid arising from the use of electronic services by the
registry save recovery of costs due to errors in data capture.51
7.4.3
How Errors Are Addressed by the Registration System
in Ireland
The following sets out how the registration system in Ireland would deal with the
scenarios above. Given that the exact nature of indefeasibility has yet to be
deﬁnitively addressed the possible options are considered below along with the
risk to each participant.
Scenarios 1 and 2 relate to a fraudulent transaction. The error did not originate in
the registry but was a transaction error that became a registry error when the
application for registration of the fraudulent transaction was accepted. As this
error did not originate in the registry the registrar and court have no power to
correct it under section 32. Instead any application for rectiﬁcation must be made to
the court under section 31.
Section 32 does apply to scenarios 3 and 4 as these relate to registry errors.
Section 31 may also apply to those errors as this section of the legislation relates not
just to fraud but also to mistakes.
Scenario 1(a)
An application to court for rectiﬁcation on the grounds of actual fraud would need
to be made by A under section 31. The court has the power to order rectiﬁcation on
46 Section 120(2).
47 Section 120(3).
48 Section 120(5)(c). The time is extended in the case of disability. See Deeney (2014), p. 347 for
some relevant case law.
49 Section 120(4) provides that all compensation is paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.

such terms as it thinks just. In this scenario an innocent prior registered owner, A, is
pitted against a bona ﬁde purchaser for value, B, and his lender, C.
As idealised participants neither A, B or C will have contributed to the error and
thus the scales of justice could tip either way. The court may order rectiﬁcation in
favour of A or may uphold the fraudulent transaction, deprive A of his interest and
afﬁrm the registered title of B and C.
Section 120 will provide for compensation to be paid to the person who suffers
loss as a result of the entry in a register caused or obtained by forgery or fraud
provided the participant’s agent did not cause or substantially contribute to the loss.
If A loses title he will be entitled to compensation, or if the court deprives B or C of
their title, they will be entitled to compensation.
Such compensation may be sufﬁcient recompense for C whose only interest in
the property is of a ﬁnancial nature but either A or B will suffer a loss of use.
Scenario 1(b)
Again section 32 does not apply and A must apply to the court under section 31. The
court has power to order rectiﬁcation on such terms as it thinks just. In this scenario
an innocent prior registered owner, A, is pitted against a subsequent bona ﬁde
purchaser for value, D, and his lender C2. B has been paid for his interest in the
property and thus is only at risk of a loss if rectiﬁcation is ordered and D reclaims
the purchase monies.
The court may order rectiﬁcation in favour of A or may uphold the transaction to
D and deprive A of his interest thus afﬁrming the registered title of D and C2.
Section 120 will provide for compensation to be paid to the person who suffers
loss as a result of the entry in a register caused or obtained by forgery or fraud
provided the participant’s agent did not cause or substantially contribute to the loss.
If A loses title he will be entitled to compensation, or if the court deprives D or C2
of their title, they will be entitled to compensation.
Such compensation may be sufﬁcient recompense for C2 whose only interest in
the property is of a ﬁnancial nature but either A or D will suffer a loss of use.
While a court may order rectiﬁcation in scenario 1(a) as B took title from a
fraudster it is less likely to order rectiﬁcation in this scenario as there is now a bona
ﬁde purchaser and lender (D and C2) who relied on the register.
Scenario 2(a)
An application to court for rectiﬁcation on the grounds of actual fraud would need
to be made by X under section 31. The court has the power to order rectiﬁcation on
such terms as it thinks just. In this scenario an innocent prior registered owner, X, is
pitted against a volunteer, Y.
As idealised participants neither X nor Y will have contributed to the error and
thus the scales of justice could tip either way. The court may order rectiﬁcation in
favour of X or may uphold the fraudulent transaction, deprive X of his interest and
afﬁrm the registered title of Y. However as Y is a volunteer and did not pay for the
property it is more likely that the court will order rectiﬁcation in favour of X.
214
7
The Register

If Y loses title he will be entitled to compensation under section 120. Since Y did
not pay for the property he will not be subject to any monetary loss but instead will
suffer a loss of enrichment and loss of use value which may be difﬁcult to quantify.
It is difﬁcult to conceive of a fraudster gifting a property he has effectively
‘stolen’ to someone who is entirely innocent. It is more likely that he will sell or
charge the property to make as much money from the theft as possible.
Scenario 2(b)
X must apply to the court under section 31. The court has power to order rectiﬁ-
cation on such terms as it thinks just. In this scenario an innocent prior registered
owner, X, is pitted against a subsequent bona ﬁde purchaser for value, D, and his
lender C2. Y has been paid for his interest in the property and thus is only at risk of a
loss if rectiﬁcation is ordered and D reclaims the purchase monies.
The court may order rectiﬁcation in favour of X or may uphold the transaction to
D and deprive X of his interest thus afﬁrming the registered title of D and C2.
Section 120 will provide for compensation to be paid to the person who suffers
loss as a result of the entry in a register caused or obtained by forgery or fraud
provided the participant’s agent did not cause or substantially contribute to the loss.
If X loses title he will be entitled to compensation, or if the court deprives D or C2
of their title, they will be entitled to compensation.
Such compensation may be sufﬁcient recompense for C2 whose only interest in
the property is of a ﬁnancial nature but either X or D will suffer a loss of use. As D
relied on the register the preference of the court may be not to rectify in order to
uphold D’s reliance on the register.
Scenario 3(a)
All parties could consent to the rectiﬁcation under section 32. Alternatively the
registrar could serve notice and rectify this error without loss to any person. S and
SL have no grounds to object to the rectiﬁcation as any enrichment they might seek
would be unjust.
If S or SL do claim that they have suffered a loss, the court can rectify under
section 32 or alternatively under section 31 on the basis of mistake. If a loss has
been sustained compensation will be payable under section 120 and B and C would
be entitled to recover the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining the rectiﬁcation.
This is available under section 120(3) where the error originated in the registry.
Scenario 3(b)
In this scenario B and C are the rightful registered owner and chargee but, as a result
of a mistake in the registry, a stranger was registered as owner and has now sold the
property to D. The charge held by SL would have been redeemed on that sale so this
party is not subject to any risk. The interests of B and C are pitted against a
subsequent bona ﬁde purchaser for value and subsequent acquisition lender.
B and C seek to have the register rectiﬁed in their favour. If the register is
rectiﬁed to restore B and C’s title then D and C2 will lose title. If the register is not
rectiﬁed D will remain the registered owner, C2’s charge will be protected but B
and C will lose title. D and C2 will not consent to rectiﬁcation as this would deprive
7.4

215

them of their interests. Neither the registrar nor court could rectify under section
32 as such rectiﬁcation would cause loss and injustice.52 The court can however
rectify under section 31 on the basis of mistake.
If no rectiﬁcation is ordered then S has been allowed take advantage of the error.
B and C would have a personal action against S on the basis of unjust enrichment. B
and C would also be entitled to compensation. If rectiﬁcation is ordered then D and
C2 would be entitled to compensation and also to recover their costs and expenses.
D and C2 are bona ﬁde parties without notice who relied upon the register so the
court is more likely to uphold their interests and refuse the request for rectiﬁcation.
Scenario 4(a)
All parties could consent to the rectiﬁcation under section 32. Alternatively the
registrar could serve notice and rectify this error without loss to any person. S has
no grounds to object to the rectiﬁcation as any enrichment he might seek would be
unjust.
If S does claim that he has suffered a loss, the court can rectify under section
32 or alternatively under section 31 on the basis of mistake. If a loss has been
sustained compensation will be payable under section 120 and Y would be entitled
to recover the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining the rectiﬁcation. This is
available under section 120(3) where the error originated in the registry.
Scenario 4(b)
In this scenario Y is the rightful registered owner but, as a result of a mistake in the
registry, a stranger was registered as owner and has now sold the property to D. The
interest of Y is pitted against a subsequent bona ﬁde purchaser for value and
subsequent acquisition lender.
Y seeks to have the register rectiﬁed in his favour. If the register is rectiﬁed to
restore Y’s title then D and C2 will lose title. If the register is not rectiﬁed D will
remain the registered owner, C2’s charge will be protected but Y will lose title. D
and C2 will not consent to rectiﬁcation as this would deprive them of their interests.
Neither the registrar nor court could rectify under section 32 as such rectiﬁcation
would cause loss and injustice.53 The court can however rectify under section 31 on
the basis of mistake.
If no rectiﬁcation is ordered then S has been allowed take advantage of the error.
Y would have a personal action against S on the basis of unjust enrichment. Y
would also be entitled to compensation. If rectiﬁcation is ordered then D and C2
would be entitled to compensation and also to recover their costs and expenses.
Monetary compensation may be sufﬁcient for C2 whose only interest in the
property is its exchange or investment value however monetary compensation is
unlikely to compensate D for its use value. Y did not pay for the property but will
still be entitled to compensation for loss of the ownership and loss of use value if the
gift is denied.

53 Unless the view was taken that compensation was an adequate remedy.

The Register

As D and C2 relied on the register, and Y did not, the court is more likely to
uphold their interests and not rectify the register in favour of Y. Also the interests of
D and C2 as bona ﬁde parties for value will likely merit a greater degree of
protection than the interest of Y, a volunteer. D and C2 paid value for their interests
while Y did not and this may be a factor in the court dispensing justice between
their respective positions.

The Position in Ontario
The Ontario registration system has been subject to signiﬁcant legislative change
and seminal court decisions on the nature of its indefeasibility and thus the position
is in many respects more clear cut.
The nature of indefeasibility in Ontario has been subject to a high level of public
controversy since a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2005. In Household
Realty Corporation Ltd. v. Liu54 a wife forged her husband’s signature on a power
of attorney and she then mortgaged their home three times. The court held that an
instrument, once registered, was effective and the mortgagees were entitled to
enforce against the husband and wife who were joint owners. This was on the
basis of section 78(4) of the Land Titles Act which deemed a registered instrument
to be effective according to its nature and intent and to create, transfer, charge or
discharge, as the case requires, the land or estate mentioned in the register.
Section 78(4) was held to override section 155 which provided that a fraudulent
instrument, if unregistered, would be fraudulent and void is, despite registration,
fraudulent and void in like manner. The mortgages having been given for valuable
consideration and without notice of the fraud were held, once registered, to be
effective and could be relied upon.
The decision was “received with widespread dismay. There was a barrage of
criticism from legal commentators, the media and the provincial government.”55
The government moved quickly to introduce a Real Estate Fraud Action Plan56 and
amending legislation. “[E]ven though the Ontario online registration system
maintained registrars’ review it moved in 2006 from immediate to deferred
indefeasibility.”57
The Ministry of Government Services Consumer Protection and Service Mod-
ernization Act 200658 (hereafter the Modernization Act) introduced amendments to
the Land Titles Act to deal with registration of forged and void instruments and, in
54 Household Realty Corporation Ltd. v. Liu 2005 CanLII 43402 (ON CA). Also referenced as

effect, introduced deferred indefeasibility.59 While Household Realty Corporation
Ltd. v. Liu was subsequently overturned in Lawrence v. Maple Trust Co.60 the
Modernization Act introduced two new provisions in the Land Titles Act.
Section 78(4.1) provided that section 78(4) would not apply to a fraudulent instru-
ment registered on or after 19 October 2006 and section 78(4.2) provided that
section 78(4.1) does not invalidate the effect of a registered instrument that is not a
fraudulent instrument including instruments registered subsequent to such a fraud-
ulent instrument. The registrar already had power to delete a fraudulent document
and rectify the register61 but deﬁnitions of fraudulent instrument and fraudulent
person were added to the Land Titles Act to address concerns about levels of
fraud.62 In addition the LRRA was amended to strengthen the ability of the registrar
to suspend and revoke access to the electronic title registration system.63
As a result of the changes introduced by the Modernization Act property owners
are protected from fraudulent documents. “The registration does not validate the
fraudulent mortgage or transfer, and it will not be enforceable against the property
owner.”64 The registrar may order the fraudulent instrument be deleted from the
register, thus returning title to the true owner.65 However non fraudulent instru-
ments registered subsequently will be effective. This is in line with sections 66, 68,
86 and 93 of the Land Titles Act whereby only the registered owner can transfer or
charge land. Title cannot be given through a forged transfer since such a transfer
was not made by the registered owner but a subsequently registered owner can
transfer or charge land.
Thus a fraudulent instrument is void despite registration and nothing in the
legislation invalidates the effect of a registered instrument that is not a fraudulent
instrument including instruments registered subsequently. This enshrined the prin-
ciple of deferred indefeasibility in legislation.
Lawrence v. Maple Trust Co. involved a fraudster who forged Mrs. Lawrence’s
signature on a contract for sale to Thomas Wright. A person purporting to be
Thomas Wright then applied to Maple Trust Co. for a mortgage to ﬁnance the
purchase. “Mr. Wright” used false identiﬁcation to obtain the mortgage and then
absconded with the funds. The transfer was registered along with a new mortgage in
favour of Maple Trust Co. Mrs. Lawrence was no longer the owner noted on the title
register and her house was now subject to a mortgage that she was not party to. At
59 The Act provided protection against the registration of fraudulent instruments, improved the
ability to rectify titles, streamlined the Land Titles Assurance Fund (LTAF) process, gave the
registrar additional powers to suspend or revoke an individual’s access to the electronic registra-
tion system and also increased the ﬁnes for real estate related offences.

The Register

the initial hearing the judge was bound by Household Realty Corporation Ltd. v. Liu
and held that the transfer was void but the mortgage was valid and enforceable. The
Court of Appeal found that the transfer to Wright was void and registration did not
cure the defect. Thus Wright did not become the registered owner and could not
transfer or charge the title.66 Thus Maple Trust Co. could not rely on section 78
(4) to gain an indefeasible title and the mortgage was invalid. Gillese J.A. found that
the wording of the Land Titles Act could be consistent with both deferred and
immediate indefeasibility but that deferred indefeasibility was preferable for policy
reasons and that it would take clear and unequivocal language in the Act to abrogate
or displace common law principles. He felt this was in line with the earlier decision
of the Supreme Court of Canada in United Trust v. Dominion Stores et al.67
Deferred indefeasibility placed the risk of loss on the mortgagee as this was the
party with the best opportunity to avoid the fraud, encourages lenders to be vigilant
and protects a subsequent purchaser. This was based on the courts decision to treat
the acquisition mortgagee as an “intermediate” rather than a “deferred” owner.68
The indefeasibility would rest with the next bona ﬁde purchaser or encumbrancer
without notice. Because the fraudulent transfer and charge were registered contem-
poraneously Maple Trust Co. did not rely on the register and there was no oppor-
tunity for Ms. Lawrence to recover the land before the second transaction i.e. the
charge. Thus the Court of Appeal in effect bundled the two transactions i.e. the
fraudulent transfer and acquisition charge together ensuring that Mrs. Lawrence’s
right to set aside both transactions was not lost by registration of the charge. This
case was decided following the introduction of the Modernization Act but before it
was enacted.
A similar bundling occurred in Home Trust Company v. Zivic69 and Rabi
v. Rosu70 where the transfer and the mortgages were to all intents and purposes
registered simultaneously and thus were treated as one transaction.71 A signiﬁcation
factor in these decisions was the fact that the mortgagees did not rely on the register.
Generally deferred indefeasibility allows the original owner a window of oppor-
tunity to set aside a registered transaction before a second transaction is registered
but these decisions provide an enhanced form of deferred indefeasibility and extend
that widow. O’Connor refers to “deferred indefeasibility-plus which denies

charge registered land.

an innocent bank’s mortgage was deemed valid even though the borrower was held not to be the

they had nothing to do with. See Troister (2004), p. 5. See also Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Jiang

indefeasible title to the second purchaser in a double-transaction fraud case.”72 The
second purchaser in these cases being the acquisition lender. Holding the transfer
and charge to be in effect ‘one’ transaction provides that indefeasibility does not
pass until there is a further transaction on the title.
A similar type bundling of the transfer and charge has occurred in England and
Wales but to different effect. In Abbey National Building Society v. Cann73
Mr. Cann purchased a leasehold ﬂat for his mother to live in, with the beneﬁt of a
mortgage from Abbey National and with monies provided by his mother, from the
sale of a previous property. It transpired that the mother had been let into occupa-
tion some 35 min before completion of the mortgage. Mr. Cann subsequently
defaulted in payment of the mortgage and Abbey National sought possession.
The mother claimed that by reason of her contribution to the purchase price coupled
with her actual occupation of the property prior to completion, she had an overrid-
ing interest which took priority to Abbey National’s mortgage.
The House of Lords held that the correct date for determining the existence of an
overriding interest was the date of registration, rather than the date of completion
but the relevant date for determining whether an interest in registered land was
protected by actual occupation and had priority over the holder of a legal estate was
the date of transfer or creation of the legal estate and not the date of registration.
Where a purchaser relied on a bank or building society loan to complete his
purchase, the transfer and charge were one indivisible transaction and there was
no scintilla temporis74 during which the property vested in the purchaser free of the
mortgage.75
By this decision acquisition lenders gained a new status and a super priority that
automatically protected them from many new adverse claims. In England and
Wales acquisition lender are thus treated better than subsequent lenders whereas
in Ontario subsequent lenders are given enhanced priority.
In Ontario in the more recent case of Isaacs v. Royal Bank of Canada76 the
mortgage was however upheld as the plaintiff actively assisted the fraudsters in
perpetrating the fraud. She was not herself privy to the fraud but was not a
completely innocent victim. She had been paid to act as guarantor on a mortgage
for a borrower with a bad credit rating. Molloy J. distinguished between the original
owner who has no knowledge of the fraud, the intermediate owner who dealt with
the fraudster and the deferred owner who took the property from the intermediate
owner without knowing of the fraud. He noted that it is only the intermediate owner
who has any opportunity to avoid the fraud and thus as a question of policy it makes

more sense to place the burden on this party. The intermediate owner will be subject
to having his or her title defeated by a claim from the original owner.
Thus Ontario operates a system of deferred indefeasibility.77 In moving from
immediate to deferred indefeasibility Ontario moved from dynamic towards static
security. It favours static security by deferring indefeasibility to subsequent trans-
ferees though the system also attempts to balance dynamic security by favouring
subsequent, non-infected by fraud, transferees.

Rectiﬁcation
Section 57(13) of the Land Titles Act allows the registrar or court to rectify the
register if (a) a registered instrument would be absolutely void if unregistered;
(b) either is satisﬁed, on the basis of evidence, that a fraudulent instrument has been
registered; or (c) the effect of the error, if not rectiﬁed, would be to deprive a person
of land of which the person is legally in possession or legally in receipt of the rents
and proﬁts. If rectiﬁcation is based on these grounds members of a prescribed class
are entitled to compensation under section 57(4.1) or 57(4.2) and these are dealt
with below.
Under section 163(1.1) the registrar may make orders specifying what evidence
is required for the purposes of clause 57(13)(b) to enable rectiﬁcation of the register
because a registered instrument was fraudulent.78 Fraudulent instrument and fraud-
ulent person are deﬁned in section 1. Fraudulent instrument means an instrument
under which a fraudulent person purports to receive or transfer an estate or interest
in land, that is given under a forged power of attorney, transfer of a charge where
the charge is given by a fraudulent person or that perpetrates a fraud as prescribed.79
Fraudulent person is a person who executes or purports to execute an instrument if
the person forged the instrument, is a ﬁctitious person or, who holds oneself out to
be, but knows that the person is not, the registered owner.
The registrar can also rectify errors and supply omissions in the register, or in an
entry in it, under section 158(2) upon evidence that appears sufﬁcient. This is not
limited to the correction of minor errors.
The Court may also order rectiﬁcation under section 159 where it decides that a
person is entitled to an estate, right or interest in or to registered land or a charge and
as a consequence rectiﬁcation is required. In such circumstances the court can order
the register to be rectiﬁed in such manner as is considered just.

opments. See also Troister (2004), p. 5.

79 Section 63 of O. Reg. 690/90 as amended by O. Reg. 439/11 prescribes this as the cessation of a
charge or encumbrance and the person who purports to register it is a fraudulent person.

The Position in Ontario

Section 160 allows a person aggrieved by an entry, omission, default or delay to
apply to the court for an order of rectiﬁcation and the court can refuse, with or
without costs to be paid by the applicant, or may if satisﬁed of the justice of the
case, make an order for the rectiﬁcation of the register.
Thus in Ontario the registrar and courts have wide ranging powers to rectify the
register.
7.5.2
Compensation
In Ontario compensation is paid out of the Land Titles Assurance Fund (LTAF).
The LTAF applies to errors in the electronic record in the same manner as it does to
paper records.80 “The existence of the [LTAF] fund acknowledges that the principle
of certainty of registration can lead to circumstances in which innocent parties lose
legal title to the property.”81
Under section 57(1) of the Land Titles Act a person wrongfully deprived of land
by reason of some other person being registered as owner through fraud or
misdescription, omission or some other error in an entry on the register can recover
compensation or damages from the person on whose application the erroneous
registration was made or who acquired the title through the fraud or error. In
addition a person wrongfully deprived of land or of some estate or interest therein
by reason of the land being brought under the Act can also recover compensation or
damages.
Thus a person wrongfully deprived of land or some estate or interest therein can
recover from the person on whose application the erroneous registration was made
or who acquired the title through the fraud or error. However, under section 57(3), a
purchaser or mortgagee in good faith for value is not liable by reason of the vendor
or mortgagor having been registered as owner through fraud or error or having
derived title from or through a person registered as owner through fraud or error,
whether the fraud or error consisted of a wrong description of the property or
otherwise. In these instances a bona ﬁde purchaser or lender for value will not be
liable directly to the person wrongfully deprived of their interest.
Section 57(4) provides for compensation from the fund for a person wrongfully
deprived of land or some estate or interest in land by reason of the land being
brought under this Act, some other person being registered as owner through fraud,
or any misdescription, omission or other error in an entry on the register. The person
must be unable to recover compensation from the person who made the application
or who acquired title through the fraud or error or otherwise recover just compen-
sation for the loss. In addition under section 57(4)(b) in order to be entitled the
person must have demonstrated ‘requisite due diligence’ if some other person was

The Register

registered as owner through fraud. Under section 163(1.1) the registrar can make
orders specifying what constitutes due diligence82 for the purposes of clause 57(4)
(b) or 57(4.1)(b).
A mortgagee will be required to demonstrate that it took reasonable steps to
verify the identity of the person mortgaging the property and to verify that the
registered owner was, in fact, selling or mortgaging the property.83 Similarly a
purchaser must demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to verify that the
registered owner was selling the property.84 Thus both must verify the transaction
and a lender must also verify identity.85
Section 57(4.1) relates only to members of a prescribed class of persons who are
entitled to compensation from the fund if certain conditions are met. The person
must have been wrongfully deprived of land or some estate or interest in land or
have not received land or some estate or interest in land because under section 57
(13)(b) the registrar or court has directed that the registration of a fraudulent
instrument be deleted from the register, or, under section 57(13)(a) or
(c) rectiﬁcation of the register is ordered on the basis that a registered instrument
would be absolutely void if unregistered or the effect of an error, if not rectiﬁed,
would be to deprive a person of land of which the person is legally in possession or
legally in receipt of the rents and proﬁts.
Section 57(4.2) also provides for compensation to be paid to members of this
prescribed class if the person suffers loss due to the deletion of a fraudulent
instrument whereas section 57(4.1) is broader. It provides for compensation if
there is rectiﬁcation of the register under any of the grounds in section 57(13).
However under section 57(4.1) the person must have demonstrated the requisite due
diligence with respect to the instrument that is the subject of the rectiﬁcation. There
is no corresponding requirement in section 57(4.2).
Previously all claimants were required to seek compensation under the law
before claiming against the fund. Now a person who is a member of this prescribed
class can, where a fraudulent instrument is registered against their interest in land,
claim against the LRAF without having to pursue the fraudster.86 Members of the
prescribed class are individuals who were registered owners of land used for
residential purposes and individuals who are purchasers in good faith for valuable
consideration of land used for residential purposes.87 Lenders are not included.

others. See Service Ontario.

The Position in Ontario
223

For these parties the LTAF is now a fund of ﬁrst resort provided they are a victim
of fraud and the loss is not covered by title insurance.88 Those within the prescribed
class who are protected by title insurance will have no claim against the fund.89
A person who suffers damage because of an error in recording an instrument can
also recover compensation from the fund under section 57(5). Under section 57(8) it
is the registrar who determines the amount of compensation to be paid and the
registrar can then recover from any person in respect of a loss to the fund.90
A person is not entitled to compensation from the fund in respect of an interest
existing at the time the land is brought under the Act unless that interest was
registered in the unregistered system or notice of it was given to the registrar before
the ﬁrst registration under the Act.91 The application for compensation must be
made within 6 years from the time of having suffered the loss.92
Section 59 sets out a number of restrictions on the payment of compensation. For
claims in relation to rights existing at the time of ﬁrst registration, no compensation
is payable out of the fund if the person ﬁrst registered could have conveyed good
title, as against the claimant, to a purchaser in good faith for value without notice of
any defect and no caution was registered and the registrar did not have actual notice
of the defect prior to ﬁrst registration. No compensation is also payable if the
claimant had notice of registration proceeding and failed to act. No compensation is
payable for any claim where the claimant’s negligence caused or contributed to the
loss, the claimant knowingly participated or colluded in a fraud, if it is a subrogated
claim or made on behalf of an insurer.
Thus a claimant will not be compensated from the fund if he or she has caused or
substantially contributed to the loss through their own act, neglect, default and/or
omission. This would include the failure to register a sufﬁcient caution, notice or
appropriate registration under the Act.93
7.5.3
How Errors Are Addressed by the Registration System
in Ontario
Where there is a fraudulent transaction rectiﬁcation can be made by the registrar or
the court under section 57(13). This will automatically trigger an entitlement to
compensation. Members of the prescribed class will be entitled to compensation
under section 57(4.1) or 57(4.2). Under section 57(4.1) the person must demon-
strate the requisite due diligence but there is no such requirement under section 57

(4.2). Section 57(4.2) refers to a person suffering loss whereas 57(4.1) refers to a
person being wrongfully deprived of land or of some estate or interest in land or has
not received land or some estate or interest in land by reason of the registration of
the fraudulent instrument that is now to be deleted from the register.
Those who are not members of this prescribed class must claim under section 57
(4). They must show the requisite due diligence and must not have been able to
recover compensation from the applicant or the new owner under section 57(1).
Also the person must have been wrongfully deprived of land or some estate or
interest in land.
The registrar has also a general power to rectify errors under section 158(2) and
the court, under section 159, can rectify the register in such manner as is considered
just where it decides that a person is entitled to an estate, right or interest in or to
registered land or a charge and as a consequence rectiﬁcation is required. Rectiﬁ-
cation under these two sections does not automatically trigger an entitlement to
compensation.
Where there is a registry error the registrar can correct the error on foot of
section 158(2) and the court can rectify under section 159. Either can rectify under
section 57(13) and again this will automatically trigger an entitlement to compen-
sation under section 57(4.1). Compensation for the error may be claimed in the
following circumstances:
1. under section 57(4.1) for members of the prescribed class who have demon-
strated the requisite due diligence and the effect of the error, if not rectiﬁed,
would be to deprive a person of land of which the person is legally in possession
or legally in receipt of the rents and proﬁts;
2. under section 57(5) to a person who suffers damage because of an error in
recording an instrument; or
3. under section 57(4) where a person is wrongfully deprived of land or of some
estate or interest in land by reason of any misdescription, omission or other error
in the register. The person must not have been able to recover compensation
from the applicant or the new owner under section 57(1).
The idealised participants will not have caused or contributed to the loss or
knowingly participated or colluded in the fraud. It is presumed that the loss is not
covered by title insurance though this does form a feature of conveyancing in
Ontario and as such will be examined in Chap. 9. Only some of the idealised
participants in the modeled transactions fall within the prescribed class of persons
for the purposes of the Land Titles Act.
Both A and X are members of the prescribed class. B is also a member but Y is
not a member. C and C2 are not members. Only those who are members can claim
compensation under section 57(4.1) and section 57(4.2). Those who are not mem-
bers must claim compensation under sections 57(4) or 57(5). The law distinguishes
between registered owners and bona ﬁde purchasers for value of residential prop-
erty and all other parties.
As noted previously, under section 57(3), a purchaser or mortgagee in good faith
for value is not liable by reason of the vendor or mortgagor having been registered

as owner through fraud or error or having derived title from or through a person
registered as owner through fraud or error, whether the fraud or error consisted of a
wrong description of the property or otherwise. This will apply in the case of all of
the (b) scenarios as D will have derived title from or through a person registered as
owner through fraud or error i.e. B, Y or S. In the case of scenario 1(a) C is also
protected if it is a mortgagee in good faith for value as it derived title from a person
registered as owner through fraud or error i.e. B. However B, Y, S and SL will not
be protected by section 57(3) as they did not derive title from or through another
person registered as owner through fraud or error.
Scenario 1(a)
The registrar or court will rectify the register by deleting the fraudulent instrument
under section 57(13)(b). This will restore A as the registered owner. B and C will
lose title. As a bona ﬁde purchaser for value B will automatically be entitled to
compensation as he will have suffered loss as a result of the deletion.
C is not a member of this class and thus will need to claim compensation under
section 57(4). C will need to show that it was wrongfully deprived of an estate or
interest in land by reason of some other person being registered as owner through
fraud. In this scenario that person was B. C will also need to demonstrate the
requisite due diligence i.e. that it took reasonable steps to verify the identity of B
and to verify that A was, in fact, selling the property. C will also need to show that it
cannot recover compensation from B or the fraudster. If the fraudster has
disappeared or was prosecuted but the proceeds of the fraud are gone then only B
will be available.
It is interesting to note that if the cancellation of T’s charge had been done
fraudulently the legislation includes this in the deﬁnition of fraudulent instrument
and the register could also be rectiﬁed under section 57(13)(b).
Scenario 1(b)
As there has been a subsequent transaction on the title the registrar and court will
not order rectiﬁcation of the register. A will lose title while the ownership of D and
C2 will be upheld. They relied on the register. A is a member of the prescribed class
but section 57(4.2) only applies when the fraudulent instrument is being deleted so
it does not apply in this instance. Also section 57(4.1) only arises similarly if there
is a rectiﬁcation. So A is only entitled to claim under section 57(4) which requires
that A must not be able to recover from B under section 57(1). A will not be able to
claim against D or C2 as they are protected by section 57(3) as a purchaser and
mortgagee in good faith for valuable consideration.
Scenario 2(a)
The registrar or court will rectify the register by deleting the fraudulent instrument
under section 57(13)(b). This will restore X as the registered owner. Y will lose
title. As a volunteer Y is not a member of the prescribed class and thus cannot claim
compensation under section 57(4.1) or 57(4.2). Also Y cannot claim under section
57(4) since it was not some other person registered as owner through fraud; it was in
fact Y who was registered through fraud. Thus Y is not entitled to compensation.
226
7
The Register

Scenario 2(b)
As there has been a subsequent transaction on the title the registrar and court will
not order rectiﬁcation of the register. X will lose title while the ownership of D and
C2 will be upheld. They relied on the register. As soon as D purchases the register is
secure regardless of the fact that the transfer to Y was a gift.
X is a member of the prescribed class but section 57(4.2) only applies when the
fraudulent instrument is being deleted so it does not apply in this instance. Also
section 57(4.1) only arises similarly if there is a rectiﬁcation. So X is only entitled to
claim under section 57(4) which requires that X must not be able to recover from Y
under section 57(1). X will not be able to claim against D or C2 as they are
protected by section 57(3) as a purchaser and mortgagee in good faith for valuable
consideration.
Scenario 3(a)
The registrar or court will rectify the register under section 57(13)(c) if the effect of
the error, if not rectiﬁed, would be to deprive B of land which he is legally in
possession or legally in receipt of the rents and proﬁts.94 This would appear to also
cover C if C was a mortgagee in possession. If this provision does not apply the
registrar can rectify the error under section 158(2) or the court can rectify under
section 159.
In this case B and C will not have been deprived of land or some estate or interest
and there has been no fraud so compensation can only be claimed under section 57
(5) on the basis that they suffered damage because of an error in recording an
instrument. S and SL would also be able to claim under this section but only if they
suffered damage.
Scenario 3(b)
The registrar or court will rectify the register under section 57(13)(c) if the effect of
the error, if not rectiﬁed, would be to deprive B of land which he is legally in
possession or legally in receipt of the rents and proﬁts. This is unlikely to be the
case as D would have sought vacant possession. The registrar can however rectify
the error under section 158(2) or the court can rectify under section 159.
D and C2 will have been deprived of their interests and thus will be able to claim
compensation under section 57(5) or section 57(4). In order to claim under section
57(4) D and C2 would need to demonstrate that they cannot recover from B or S
under section 57(1). It is unlikely that they would be able to recover from B since he
is entirely innocent in this scenario but they should be able to recover from S. S is
not a bona ﬁde purchaser for value and thus would not be protected by section 57
(3).
If the court does not order rectiﬁcation and the interests of D and C2 are upheld
on the basis that they relied on the register then B and C will have been deprived of
their interests and will be entitled to compensation under section 57(5) or section 57
(4). In order to claim under section 57(4) B and C will need to demonstrate that they

The Position in Ontario
227

cannot recover from S or D. D will be protected from such a claim under section 57
(3) but S will not.
Scenario 4(a)
The registrar or court will rectify the register under section 57(13)(c) if the effect of
the error, if not rectiﬁed, would be to deprive Y of land which he is legally in
possession or legally in receipt of the rents and proﬁts. If this provision does not
apply the registrar can rectify the error under section 158(2) or the court can rectify
under section 159.
In this case Y will not have been deprived of land or some estate or interest and
there has been no fraud so compensation can only be claimed under section 57(5) on
the basis that he suffered damage because of an error in recording an instrument.
The fact that Y is a volunteer has no impact on the situation. S would also be able to
claim under this section if he suffered damage.
Scenario 4(b)
The registrar or court will rectify the register under section 57(13)(c) if the effect of
the error, if not rectiﬁed, would be to deprive Y of land which he is legally in
possession or legally in receipt of the rents and proﬁts. This is unlikely to be the
case as D would have sought vacant possession. The registrar can however rectify
the error under section 158(2) or the court can rectify under section 159.
If D and C2 are deprived of their interests they will be able to claim compen-
sation under section 57(5) or section 57(4). In order to claim under section 57(4) D
and C2 would need to demonstrate that they cannot recover from Y or S under
section 57(1). It is unlikely that they would be able to recover from Y since he is
entirely innocent in this scenario but they should be able to recover from S. S is not
a bona ﬁde purchaser for value and thus would not be protected by section 57(3).
Similarly Y is not protected as a volunteer.
If the court does not order rectiﬁcation and the interests of D and C2 are upheld
then Y will have been deprived of its interest and will be entitled to compensation
under section 57(5) or section 57(4). In order to claim under section 57(4) Y will
need to demonstrate that it cannot recover from S or D. D will be protected from
such a claim under section 57(3) but S will not.
7.6
Impact on Risk
The above scenarios demonstrate the choice to be made between dynamic security
and static security. In cases of conﬂict between two innocent parties will the Irish
courts hold that the register is defeasible or indefeasible and, if indefeasibility is
supported, will it be immediate or deferred? Will the interests of B and C or D and
C2 be bundled together to the detriment of the lender? Or will lenders be given
more preferential status?
228
7
The Register

A policy of defeasibility may be likely where there is no subsequent transaction.
Under section 31 the register could be rectiﬁed in favour of A and X. B, C and Y
would be entitled to compensation under section 120.
A policy of indefeasibility would mean no rectiﬁcation. If immediate indefeasi-
bility is adopted then A will be at risk from the destructive effects of a registered
transaction. A would be treated the same as U and V in Chap. 8 as title would pass to
B and C2 even if there was some fault in the transaction and it was based on error or
fraud. Under section 120 A would be entitled to compensation.
X is unlikely to be at the same risk in respect of Whiteacre. A court is unlikely to
treat Y the same as the other parties and rectiﬁcation is likely to be ordered against
him if his registered title conﬂicts with that of X, an innocent prior owner, as Y is a
volunteer. Y would however be entitled to compensation under section 120.
If there is a subsequent transaction a policy of deferred indefeasibility would
mean that the innocent prior owner of Greenacre, A, would lose title.95 Title would
pass to the subsequent purchaser D and his lender C2. The ﬁrst holders of the
defective title, B and C, would not be at risk as they got repaid on the sale to the new
owner who relied on the register i.e. D and C2. With deferred indefeasibility it is the
original owner A who looses out. Similarly in the transfer of Whiteacre X would be
at risk. Y would be paid on the sale to D so he would not lose out and the title of D
and C2 would be upheld.
All the parties suffering loss would be entitled to compensation under section
120. In this instance A and X would be entitled to compensation and no distinction
is made between a lender, volunteer or bona ﬁde purchaser for value. Each is
equally entitled to claim compensation though the amount of such compensation
may differ. It is interesting to compare this to the preferential treatment given to B
in Ontario as a bona ﬁde purchaser for value versus the restrictions on Y and C in
claiming compensation as they are not members of the prescribed class.
Some data is available on the number of claims made and amount of compen-
sation paid out by the registries in Ireland and Ontario. These claims can be placed
in the context of the total amount of changes made to the title register in Ireland and
total number of electronic registrations in Ontario.
95 In effect A would be treated the same as U and V in Chap. 8 i.e. destructive effects of a registered
transaction.

Claims
7.7.1
Claims in Ireland
In Ireland over the 10 year period from 2004 to end 2013 a total of 276 payments
were made to the value of €1.95 million.96 Table 7.1 sets out details of the changes
to the title register, the number of claims and compensation paid for this period.97
No data is available as to the nature of these claims. It may be that many relate to
the recovery of costs for rectiﬁcations agreed between the parties under section
32 of the 1964 Act.
7.7.2
Claims in Ontario
More detailed data is publicly available from Ontario on claims, payment of
compensation and rectiﬁcations.
In 2006 the Land Titles Act was amended to provide for the registration of a
caution by the registrar98 if it appears that a registered instrument may be fraudulent
in order to prevent any further transactions on the title. If such a caution has been
entered the registrar may hold a hearing before ordering rectiﬁcation of the register.
If the hearing determines that the registered instrument is a fraudulent instrument as
deﬁned under section 1 of the Land Titles Act then an order is issued to rectify the
title by deleting the instrument from the parcel register.99
Since this power was granted to the registrar 60 such cautions have been
registered and these have led to 43 rectiﬁcations of the register as set out in
Table 7.2.100 This also lists the volume of electronic registrations for each
year.101 This caution/hearing process only relates to allegations of fraud. Table 7.2
thus lists where an order for rectiﬁcation is made when there is a determination that
a fraudulent instrument has been registered.

Only nine of the 43 caution/hearing rectiﬁcations have resulted in claims to the
LTAF paying out a total of $105,275.102 It may be that the parties affected by the
other rectiﬁcations did not seek compensation or they may not have qualiﬁed on the
basis of being covered by title insurance.103
There is a separate process whereby each of the individual land registrars can
register a caution and serve notice of intention to rectify title on all parties having an
interest where an error in a record has occurred.104 If no objections are received the
correction will be made or if there are objections then a hearing will take place.
These are not tracked separately105 and there are no statistics available on the
number of such rectiﬁcations.
Information is however available on compensation claims for fraud and non
fraud cases. Table 7.3 gives the total number of LTAF claims for compensation and
the total amounts paid out while Table 7.4 provides a breakdown between the
claims and amounts for fraud and non fraud cases.106
If a claim cannot be paid out completely the registrar, acting in the capacity of an
administrative Tribunal,107 may choose to hold a hearing. The decisions of this
Tribunal are made available online to the public and the decisions from 1986 are
currently available.108 These decisions issue when a determination has been made
that the loss does not meet the requirements under the Land Titles Act and is not

not included in the above statistics. Table 7.5 is a review of the decisions since

Service Ontario111 also provide details of compensation paid by notice of

The registry report that the incidence of title fraud involving unauthorised
changes to the title register is extremely low relative to the number of registrations
each year. Over the 10 year period from 2002 to 2011, there were on average 10.2
claims of title fraud each year to the LTAF out of an average of 1.8 million
registrations.113
By 2010 fraud had moved from being the ﬁfth most common cause of claims in
conveyancing to third place and fraud costs are going up.114 Though this may be
attributed in part to increases in property prices. Murray distinguishes between
mortgage fraud, where the value of the property may be artiﬁcially inﬂated or when
a mortgage is fraudulently obtained, based on false information or identiﬁcation,
and title fraud which involves fraudsters using stolen identity or forged documents
to transfer title or obtain loan funds without the true owner’s knowledge.115

The Register

Murray is of the view that, as “there have been few claims to the Land Titles
Assurance Fund resulting from. . .[the automation] process, it has been a successful
initiative.”116 Moore and Globe provide a different perspective on the low level of
claims. They are of the view that that
[i]n practice, claims against the Land Titles Assurance Fund and professional practice
claims against LawPRO are difﬁcult and expensive to pursue. Case law, combined with
restrictions in the statute, bar potential claimants in most cases from recovering against the
fund, particularly with respect to criminal fraud.117
This, in their view, explains the extent of title insurance in Ontario as it “pro-
vides a practical, non-litigious alternative for clients who wish to arrange additional
protection against fraud or defects in the title or legal services related aspects of a
real estate transaction.”118 They refer to the fact that over half of residential trans-
actions include the purchase of title insurance119 however this was in 2003. The
percentage is now much higher.120 This relationship between state compensation
and title insurance is examined further in Chap. 9.
There is a question mark over the value of such information and its compara-
bility between jurisdictions. Is a low level of claims, where little money is paid out,
evidence of a careful and robust registration system or are the rules just too tight?
Does a deﬁcit of applications for compensation indicate an inherently fairness in the
rules of registration and that few people are disadvantaged? Or does it indicate the
opposite i.e. that the system is inherently unfair, there can be few valid claims and
this unfairness is hidden because the detail of applications for compensation are
hidden?
Certainly in Ireland there is a lack of hard data about errors in registration and
many disputes only come to light when there is a court judgment. This is a
challenge for research in this area and makes it difﬁcult to explore samples of
types of transactions where errors arise and also to weigh incidences of errors as
against fraud. A high incidence of errors and claims against the register would make
indefeasibility unsustainable however if indefeasibility was abandoned and insur-
ance removed then the register would become a mere deeds register.121

Conclusion
Subject to there being no change in the underlying legislation the question
arises as to whether eConveyancing will lead to a higher or lower incidence of
errors. A high incidence of errors would lead to a backlash against the move
towards eConveyancing or a demise of the protection afforded by registration
by judicial decisions that erode that protection. If the register cannot be relied
upon and errors are frequent then there will be a reluctance to move towards
eConveyancing with its increased reliance on registration.
In some instances this reliance is based on increasing the obligations of
lawyers who use the system. Muir is of the view that the registration system
has always relied on the integrity and honesty of conveyancing professionals
and thus there is nothing new in New Zealand’s automatic system.122
eRegistration reinforces the role of lawyers as trusted professionals in the
conveyancing process and questioning this “would portray a very dim view of
the competence and integrity of the legal profession.”123 However this dis-
regards the transfer of increased liability to such professionals and the danger
that, in time, the compensation fund would be disbanded in favour of direct
liability being imposed on such users of the system or on land owners who
may of necessity turn to title insurance.124
As Ireland is not proposing to implement an automatic system there will be
no passing of the registrars function to lawyers. Changes to the title register
will not be opened up to a wider pool of people which would potentially
increase the likelihood for error or fraud.125 The registrar only will continue
to be responsible for making changes to the register. There will be no passing
of liability for registration and no argument that the compensation fund
provisions or cover should be amended or diluted.126 This aspect is explored
further in Chap. 9.
Ireland has a robust registration system which has been subject to few
challenges and the likelihood is that further advances in eRegistration and
eConveyancing may only serve to strengthen this. Initial evidence suggests
that errors in registration applications are reduced due to the automatic
compliance checks built into the electronic system. Thus the threat to all

parties from an unauthorised or illegitimate alteration of the register may
reduce in an eConveyancing environment.127
In both Ontario and Ireland rectiﬁcation is allowed by the court or the
registrar. Compensation may be payable from the indemnity fund as a ﬁrst
resort and there is no need for the disposed homeowner to sue the
wrongdoer.128
Rectiﬁcation in Ireland by the registrar is limited to errors originating in
the registering authority. In those circumstances the title register can be
rectiﬁed and compensation will be payable to any person who suffers loss
as a result of the error. In the case of errors not originating in the registering
authority rectiﬁcation can be ordered by the court if there is actual fraud or
mistake. Compensation will be payable to anyone who suffered a loss.
The legislation is broad enough to allow Ireland a choice between follow-
ing the Torrens systems which gives an absolute guarantee of title to D
(deferred indefeasibility) or the Australian and New Zealand systems which
give an absolute guarantee of title to B (immediate indefeasibility).129
The question of fairness arises and whether immediate indefeasibility
awards ownership to the ‘wrong’ person. When there are a number of
innocent parties how does the law determine which person’s interest is to
be valued the most? To award title to the new owner offends against the
principle nemo dat quod non habet and deprives A of his title without his
consent. There is a conﬂict between the registered ownership of B, C, D or C2
and A’s claim for reinstatement. The law must balance between the title
register giving no guarantee at all, thus becoming a deeds register, and the
potential unfairness of absolute and immediate indefeasibility.
In Ontario the register will be rectiﬁed in favour of A and against B and C
except when the title has been sold to D. Once the subsequent transaction to D
has taken place no rectiﬁcation will be ordered and A may be entitled to
compensation. The sale to B and charge in favour of C will be seen as one
transaction and indefeasibility will be deferred to D with a knock on beneﬁt
for C2. Ontario favours deferred indefeasibility and certainty of the register
thus D, who has relied on the register, will prevail over an innocent prior
registered owner, A.
This deferred indefeasibility protects those market participants that rely on
the register, thus upholding dynamic security however when there is no
subsequent transaction static security prevails. As Bucknall notes deferred
(continued)
127 For example British Columbia appears to have a robust eRegistration system. In the past
10 years the LTSA processed over nine million transactions but only two claims related to fraud
causing loss of title occurred and were paid from the compensation fund. See BC OnLine.
128 In Ontario this is limited to members of a prescribed class.

indefeasibility means that the circumstances in which a landowner loses his
or her legal title through a fraud will be extremely rare.130
Ireland has not had a landmark fraud case with an innocent prior owner
pitted against an innocent registered transferee. Cooke notes that Irish writers
are untroubled by the issue of indefeasibility as it is not clear from the
legislation or comment upon it what would be the position of an innocent
purchaser tracing title through a forged disposition.131 She notes that either it
has never arisen or has been dealt with by the registrar and remains
unreported but the likelihood is that an English approach would be taken
based on section 31.132
According to Cooke the English approach expresses indefeasibility in
money, not in land.133 The transferee, who took from a fraudster, will be
paid compensation while an innocent prior owner will get his land back. In
England however, if the transferee is in possession, he will keep the land and
the innocent prior owner will get compensation. Surely this comment by
Cooke clouds two different aspects of title registration. Firstly, indefeasible
title as being conclusive and unimpeachable134 and secondly the compensa-
tion provisions which ameliorate the adverse impact of that indefeasibility.
These are distinct elements which are not interchangeable.
Title indefeasibility will protect ownership of the speciﬁc piece of land but
compensation indefeasibility treats ownership in general as equivalent to
wealth. The nature of title indefeasibility is not merely to preserve value or
wealth but instead, for land owners, it will mean that their title to that speciﬁc
piece of property is preserved. Compensation indefeasibility puts a ﬁnancial
value on ownership and this can only be equivalent to title indefeasibility
when the owner is interested in the exchange value and not the use value of
the land. This is generally the case with lenders.
In Ireland the registrar does not have the power to rectify where there is a
forged disposition and the Irish courts have not had opportunity to examine
these issues. Thus it is not surprising that Irish researchers and writers have
failed to examine the matter in any depth. There may be an examination of
rectiﬁcation or compensation but it is not couched in the cloak of
indefeasibility.
If deferred indefeasibility is adopted then A would be entitled to compen-
sation and the subsequent owner D would retain title. If immediate

indefeasibility is adopted then A would again be entitled to compensation and
title would pass to B however if the title was held to be defeasible A would
retain title and B would be entitled to compensation.
The key decisions are policy ones. How should Ireland decide the balance
between indefeasibility (immediate or deferred) and defeasibility of the
register, dynamic and static security, the right to title and the right to
compensation?
The Ontario experience shows a high level of electronic integration is
compatible with a policy that respects and protects static security while
placing due diligence requirements on those parties most able to systemati-
cally police and keep the system honest. In order to show justice the system
attempts to balance static and dynamic security and this determines which
risks are indemniﬁed by compensation and which are not.
Chapter 8 now examines the remaining risk categories arising after
registration.

Chapter 8
After Registration
8.1
Introduction
The interest of a registered owner may be subject to claims, whereby U or V seek
such relief as a court may grant. The claim may be legal or equitable and may arise
from rights which the registered owner created whether by contract or by conduct in
favour of U or V. In such circumstances the court may order the registered owner to
give up the whole or part of their registered interest1 or to note a burden, such as a
judgment mortgage, on it.
Where the registered owner is ordered to give up their interest to U or V this may
be due to a number of factors. A volunteer will have taken the land subject to all
prior unregistered rights held by U or V. Alternatively there may have been some
defect in the transfer that makes the title void or voidable at the instigation of U or
V. The court may order rectiﬁcation of the register.
Section 57(13) of the Ontario Land Titles Act allows the registrar or court to
rectify the register if a registered instrument would be absolutely void if
unregistered. There is no similar provision in Ireland. Section 30(1) of the 1964
Act does provide that any disposition or charge which if unregistered would be
fraudulent and void, shall, notwithstanding registration, be fraudulent and void in
like manner. This however is subject to the provisions of the Act with respect to
registered dispositions for valuable consideration. In the absence of fraud, rectiﬁ-
cation could be ordered by the court under section 31 on the basis of mistake. In this
way U and V could enforce a claim or right against the registered owner.
Chapter 7 has already examined the position where a claim leads to rectiﬁcation
of the register. This chapter examines other lesser type claims. The registered owner
is not dispossessed but his interest may be impacted by the claim if it is successful.
1 See Deeney (2014), p. 173 for examples of cases where ownership passes to another person
otherwise than by transfer from the registered owner. This is subject to notice being given to the
registered owner except where their estate or interest is overreached. See p. 175.

Alternatively the claim may not be recognised or the registered owner may be able
to transfer free of it. When this happens the interest of the claim or right holder is
at risk.
This chapter deals with these remaining risk categories as identiﬁed in Chap. 5.
These are interests off the register which affect title, the destructive effects of a
registered transaction and interests not recognised and not capable of registration.
Each category demonstrates how third party rights are impacted by the registration
system and the effect of those rights on the other participants.
8.1.1
Interests Off the Register Which Affect Title
All parties to a conveyancing transaction are at risk with respect to interests off the
register which affect title.
These risks can be divided into two categories. Firstly the risk from overriding
interests. Overriding interests bind the registered owner whether shown on the
register or not.2 Those who hold such an interest possess an invaluable beneﬁt3 as
their interest binds the world even a bona ﬁde purchaser for value. These present a
risk to all parties. The risk is from U and V.
Secondly there is the risk from other interests and claims. They may be interests
already held by U or arise when V makes a successful property claim and becomes
U. This presents a risk to all parties and the risk is from the prior owner or from U
and V. The risk from those other interests and claims arising during the registration
gap has already been examined in Chap. 6. Chapter 7 has dealt with the position
where a claim of prior ownership might arise after registration thus leading to
rectiﬁcation of the register. Thus this chapter will examine the risk from overriding
interests and this is the ﬁrst risk category to be examined in this chapter.
8.1.2
Destructive Effects of a Registered Transaction
A registered transaction poses a risk to U the third party and V the property
claimant.
It may be that some other right has priority and destroys the third party right or
property claim. Any system of registration that requires an interest to be registered
if it is to survive a disposition entails the risk of non-compliance and subsequent
destruction. These failed property interests are lost. They are void against a

the title register is meant to reﬂect.

purchaser for want of protection by registration. When this occurs it could be said
that the interest is overridden by registration.
This is due to the destructive effects of a registered transaction. Due to the
transaction B, C or Y’s right may take priority over the right held by U or asserted
by V. U may hold an equitable interest by virtue of a direct or indirect ﬁnancial
contribution or as a result of some agreement or arrangement with A or X. If that
interest is not an overriding interest and U does not register a note on the folio, or
the interest itself, if it is capable of registration, then a purchaser who registers
subsequently will take free of the unprotected equitable interest.
The registered transaction may transfer the claim of V or the right of U to some
other property, devalue the claim or destroy it entirely. In circumstances where the
claim is transferred it would be more accurate to say that the right is defeated as a
claim against the land but it may continue to be a claim against other property
i.e. the fund.
This transfer is known as overreaching.4 This may arise in relation to property
rights that are capable of affecting title but which cannot be registered directly. An
example is the beneﬁcial interest under a trust. It survives a purchase but the interest
of the beneﬁciary may be overreached by the purchaser and the right of the
beneﬁciary becomes a right to the trust funds. While the right is not destroyed by
a disposition it does become different in nature. The beneﬁciary may also have a
personal claim against the trustee if the trustee acted in breach of the trust. In some
instances these rights are not overreached and this is the situation where the transfer
is to a volunteer such as Y.
This is the second risk category to be examined in this chapter.
8.1.3
Rights Not Recognised
In the schematic U and V are at risk if their claim or right is not protected by the
registering authority as it is not recognised as a right capable of registration by the
legislation. The state acting through the registrar will refuse registration. This will
apply if the right is purely personal and cannot be converted into a property right,
the right is not a registrable right or the claim by V is not mature. Where rights are
not recognised by the registration system they cannot gain the protection offered by
registration. This is the third and last category of risk examined in this chapter.

overreached and overridden. See also City of London Building Society v. Flegg [1987] 3 All ER

Introduction

8.1.4
Scenarios
In order to examine these risks in detail a number of scenarios are presented to
demonstrate the impact of different types of rights and claims on the participants in
the schematic.5
Scenario 1(a)
A grants a short term tenancy of Greenacre to U for a period of 2 years. Under
the terms of the tenancy U is in occupation of Greenacre.
Scenario 1(b)
X grants a short term tenancy of Whiteacre to U for a period of 2 years. Under
the terms of the tenancy U is in occupation of Whiteacre.
Scenario 2(a)
U gave A the purchase monies for Greenacre.
Scenario 2(b)
U gave X the purchase monies for Whiteacre.
Scenario 3(a)
U claims that he has a right of way by prescription over Greenacre.
Scenario 3(b)
X expressly grants U a right of way over Whiteacre.
Each of these scenarios is examined in detail in the context of the conveyancing
systems in Ireland and Ontario.
8.2
Overriding Interests
Some overriding interests are detectable if the appropriate enquiries are made.
Some are interests which are deemed to be in need of protection such as rights
held by someone in occupation and others are deemed unsuitable for registration.
The existence of such overriding interests makes the register an incomplete
reﬂection of the state of the title at any given moment. Where such interests exist
the state guarantee of title is qualiﬁed. The register will warrant that the title of the
land owner is as stated on the register. It will not warrant that the title cannot be
5 See Megarry and Wade (2000), pp. 130–131 for similar type examples to illustrate the position in
England and Wales.

After Registration

affected by anything off the register. These interests make the guarantee of title less
effective and are seen as being one exception to indefeasibility.
The overriding interests that apply in Ontario and Ireland are set out in Chap. 2
under neutral vocabulary. Examples of overriding interests are short term leases,
rates, taxes, easements or the rights of someone in occupation. They may be
apparent by an inspection of the property or identiﬁable from some public source
of information. Purchasers are expected to check such registers, make appropriate
enquiries and inspect the property. They may also seek a declaration from the
transferor stating that no such interests arise.6 Overriding interests “operate outside
the registered system and are treated as being like unregistered land. They have to
be ascertained by the traditional methods of investigation of inquiry and inspec-
tion.”7 Consequently the existence of such interests make it difﬁcult to implement a
full eConveyancing system.
There are in effect two different types of overriding interests but they are given
the same degree of protection. Some overriding interests do not require occupation
while scenario 1 relates to an overriding interest contingent upon occupation. The
rights of an occupier should be distinguished from the fact of his occupation. In the
English case of Wallcite Ltd. v. Ferrishurst Ltd.8 an option to purchase was an
overriding interest whereas in the Irish case of Honiball v. McGrath,9 which cited
the English case, rights to receive care facilities were not considered to be rights
in land.
Any interest in land may be protected by actual occupation10 however, a
personal right cannot be an overriding interest even if the claimant is in occupation
As per Lord Templeman in City of London Building Society v. Flegg11 there had to
be a combination of an interest which justiﬁed continuing occupation plus actual
occupation to constitute an overriding interest; actual occupation was not an interest
in itself. The right must be a property right in its nature and capable of binding land.
This is demonstrated by the English case of National Provincial Bank Ltd.
v. Ainsworth12 where a wife who remained in the former family home was held
to have a personal right against her husband and she had no right good against third
parties. She did not have an overriding interest under section 70(1)(g) of the Land
Registration Act 1925 and the bank was entitled to possession.13 This subsection
was replicated in section 72(1)(j) of Ireland’s 1964 Act.

transaction in Ireland.

8.2
Overriding Interests
247

8.2.1
Short Term Tenancy
Short term tenancies are capable of being overriding interests in both Ireland and
Ontario provided the tenant is in occupation.14
In Ireland the term must be for less than 21 years and in Ontario there must be an
unexpired term of less than 3 years. The short term tenancies granted by A and X in
scenario 1 are for 2 years and the tenant is in occupation. The tenancies fall within
the category of overriding interests in both Ireland and Ontario and have the same
effect.
If U was not in occupation under the tenancy then his interest would not be an
overriding interest. Similarly if U held an option to purchase or a beneﬁcial interest
then it would not be overriding until he goes into occupation. If U does not hold an
overriding interest his tenancy will be treated the same as the expressly granted
right of way is treated in Ireland in scenario 3(b).15
The interest will be an overriding interest providing there is occupation under the
tenancy or lease. This contrasts with the position in Ireland for other rights where
there is occupation. Those rights are overriding except where, upon enquiry the
rights are not disclosed by the person holding them.16
Scenario 1(a)
If the tenancy was not disclosed by A, B will buy subject to it but will have a claim
against A. If it was disclosed by A on the sale, B will still be subject to it but will
have no claim against A. Such an interest will bind B despite the fact that it is not
reﬂected on the register and even if B had no notice of its existence. C’s interest will
also be subject to it but C may have a claim against B if the existence of the interest
was known by B but was not disclosed and it has an impact on the value of C’s
security.
For example if B defaults on the repayments then C may not be able to enforce
its charge and sell as a mortgagee in possession while the tenancy exists as U is in
occupation of Greenacre.
Scenario 1(b)
Y will take Whiteacre subject to the tenancy and Y will have no claim against X
unless X gave a warranty that there was no such interest. This is unlikely given the
fact that this is a gift. Again notice or the lack of notice of the interest is irrelevant.
14 Section 72(1)(i) of the 1964 Act and section 44(1) paragraph 4 of the Land Titles Act.
15 It is a burden which may be registered under section 69(1)(g) of the 1964 Act. This refers to any
lease where the term granted is for a life or lives, or is determinable on a life or lives, or exceeds
21 years, or where the term is for any less estate or interest but the occupation is not in accordance
with the lease.
16 See Sect. 2.3.2. In England and Wales where there is an interest protected by actual occupation
consideration is given to the discoverability of that occupation. A transferee is not bound by such
an interest where the occupation would not have been obvious on a reasonably careful inspection
of the land at the time of the disposition. See the Land Registration Act 2002, Sch 3, para 2(c).
248

After Registration

8.2.2
Effect of Overriding Interest
The effect of an overriding interest is that the interests of B, Y and C may be
devalued and they will suffer a loss of investment. If the overriding interest includes
the right to occupation B and Y will not have the use value of the property and C
may not be able to enforce its charge so that it will have little or no value as security.
These interests bind the world and it is irrelevant that B, C or Y did not have
notice of the existence of the interest. In the case of these interests there is no
difference in risk between B and Y. Both are equally bound by such interests. It
does not matter whether the interest could have been registered, and was not, or that
the interest is unregistrable. Equally it is of no relevance whether the overriding
interest existed prior to completion of the transaction or came into existence during
the registration gap.
This can occur if a right capable of being overriding is granted by A or X or
matures during the registration gap. This right is granted to or held by V who then
becomes U. Such a right will be good against A or X and B or Y will take the
property subject to it.
In practical terms both B and Y would have sought vacant possession. They are
also likely to have inspected the property and discovered the occupation by U if it
had not already been disclosed by A and X. In the case of Greenacre if A contracted
to give vacant possession but was not able to do so, B would have a right of
rescission.
Unlike Ireland, Ontario does not protect the rights of those in receipt of rents and
proﬁts.17 This can be more problematic to determine but again B and Y would likely
be warned of the interest when ﬁnding a lessee in occupation. If such interests or
potential interests come to light U may be required to join in the transaction to
release the property or asked to postpone their claim in order to give C’s charge
priority.
All parties are at risk from overriding interests. This risk to A, B, X, Y, C and D
on a subsequent transaction is the same regardless whether the participant is a bona
ﬁde purchaser for value or a volunteer. All are equally at risk though some parties
may have a claim against another. In the modeled transactions B may have a claim
against A, C may have a claim against B and D may have a claim against his vendor.
Y is unlikely to have a claim against X as he is a volunteer and takes subject to all
unregistered rights, whether or not they are overriding interests.
17 This is an alternative to actual occupation under section 72(1)(j).

Overriding Interests

8.3
Destructive Effects of a Registered Transaction
The transfer of a legal estate or interest may overreach any over-reachable equitable
interest held by U. Overreaching will not occur if the transfer was expressly subject
to the equitable interest. There may also be certain formalities that have to be
adhered to.
The trust provides a clear demonstration of how a registered transaction may
have this destructive effect by virtue of overreaching the beneﬁcial interest held by
U. If overreaching occurs it does not destroy the equitable interest but removes it as
a claim against the land and instead the claim attaches to the trust fund.
Overreaching will cleanse the title taken by the transferee of the equitable interest
and protect the security of his registered interest. The title will be simpliﬁed as U
will have no claim on the title. In terms of the idealised participants U will become
V. In the case of a wrongful sale, V may then have a personal action against the
transferor.
If the transferor uses the trust fund to buy another property then V’s beneﬁcial
interest will once more be in the land. V will become U again.
8.3.1
Trust
In Ireland section 21(1) of the 2009 Act provides for the overreaching of trusts and
settlements where there are two trustees or a trust corporation but in some instances
only a single trustee is required.18 The overreaching is provided for the protection
of transferees where there is the transfer of a legal estate or interest.19
Thus a transferee can overreach existing equitable interests provided he or she
acts in good faith and pays the purchase monies to the appropriate people i.e. in this
instance the trustees.
A transferee does not gain this protection if the conveyance was made for
fraudulent purposes and the transferee had actual knowledge of this at the time,
or was a party to the fraud. In addition overreaching will not occur if the transfer
was subject to the equitable interest, or the equitable interest is protected by the
deposit of title documents,20 or in the case of a trust was protected by registration, or
takes effect as a burden protected by section 72(1)(j) of the 1964 Act. Section 72(1)
(j) protects the rights of persons in actual occupation of the land or in receipt of the
rents and proﬁts, save where, upon enquiry made of such persons the rights are not
disclosed. The exception for a trust protected by registration or occupation only
applies where there is a single trustee.21 Thus where there is a single trustee the trust

19 See Sect. 8.3.2 for the reason for its introduction and the effect of overreaching.
20 This is contradictory given the move towards dematerialisation in the 2006 Act.
21 Section 21(3)(b)(iii).
250
8
After Registration

will not be overreached if the beneﬁciary is in occupation and the interest is
protected as an overriding interest.
Where there are two trustees or a trust corporation the statutory overreaching
provisions will be activated. This is similar to the position in England and Wales
where occupation does not prevent overreaching if the correct formalities are
complied with. In City of London Building Society v. Flegg22 the beneﬁciaries of
a trust were found to have no right to continue in occupation when their interests
were overreached by the legal charge. Their rights were transferred to the equity of
redemption and they were prejudicially affected by the breach of trust, not by the
overreaching provisions.
While the term overreaching is not used there are other statutory provisions with
similar effect in that they free purchasers from equitable claims. These provisions
apply to sale by a personal representative23 or a mortgagee exercising a power of
sale.24 In the former case the interests of the beneﬁciaries will be overreached and
in the later it will be the borrower’s interest that is overreached.25 The transferee
will take free from the mortgage and the borrower’s equity of redemption. These
provisions are more widely drafted in that a purchaser does not have to comply with
any formalities about how the purchase monies are to be paid.26
When overreaching occurs the equitable interest continues to exist but it cannot
be asserted against the title. Instead it is transferred to the money. In effect the right
or claim is not destroyed by the registered transaction but it does take a different
form. The beneﬁciary will only get a portion or the whole of the monies and this is
obviously preferable to the interest or claim being destroyed in its entirety. How-
ever, there is the possibility that such monies may have been dissipated. The
transferor may have disappeared or there may be no funds left where a lender has
been paid on foot of a charge. Thus V may be left with no recourse. In effect their
right has been devalued.
There are no overreaching provisions in the Ontario legislation and purchasers
are entitled to ignore the existence of any trust. Section 62(1) of the Land Titles Act
provides that trusts are not recognised. Describing an owner as trustee is deemed
not to be notice of a trust, those dealing with the owner have no duty to enquire as to
his power and the owner may deal with the land as if such description had not been
inserted.27 This was conﬁrmed in Randvest Inc. v. 741298 Ontario Ltd.28
In the case of a sale by a mortgagee, the mortgagee can deal with the property as
if they were the registered owner of the land provided they have a power of sale and

Destructive Effects of a Registered Transaction

provide certain evidence to the registrar.29 Section 99(1.1) of the Land Titles Act
says that this evidence is conclusive evidence of compliance with the requirements
and upon registration of a transfer is sufﬁcient to give a good title to the purchaser.
In the case of a personal representative he can be registered as owner under section
121 of the Land Titles Act if he has an express or implied power of sale. While the
term ‘overreach’ is not used this is the effect of these sections.
Scenario 2(a)
Because U gave A the purchase monies for Greenacre the court found, on applica-
tion by U, that A holds Greenacre on trust for U. A has now sold Greenacre to B.
In Ontario B does not need to concern himself with the existence of the trust and
does not need to make any enquiries about A’s entitlement to sell. A and B can deal
with the property as if the trust did not exist as U’s beneﬁcial interest has no impact
on the sale.
In Ireland B can only take Greenacre free of the trust provided a number of
conditions are met. The transfer must not have been subject to the trust or made for
fraudulent purposes. In addition the trust must not have been protected by registra-
tion and U must not be in occupation as his interest would then be protected as an
overriding interest.
If B meets these conditions he will take Greenacre free of the trust. U’s claim
will transfer to the trust fund. While U loses any prospect of enjoying the land itself
he has a corresponding interest in the trust fund. Also if A acted wrongfully, U will
have a personal claim against A for breach of trust.
The trust cannot be protected by registration in its own right but if U had
protected his interest by registering a note on the folio before the sale of Greenacre
to B then overreaching would not automatically occur. Such a note on the register
will put B on notice of the existence of the trust and he will then need to be careful
to comply with the correct formalities. A would need to apply for a second trustee to
be appointed in order to facilitate the sale and allow overreaching.
In the interim, as there is only a single trustee, U can protect his interest against a
transfer to B by occupation. In this situation if B proceeded with the purchase he
would take Greenacre subject to the beneﬁcial interest as U would hold an over-
riding interest.
Scenario 2(b)
Because U gave X the purchase monies for Whiteacre the court found, on applica-
tion by U, that X holds Whiteacre on trust for U. X has now gifted Whiteacre to Y.
The position in Ontario is the same as above. X and Y can deal with the property
as if the trust did not exist.
In Ireland the position of Y as a volunteer is different to that of B as Y will take
subject to the interest of U. The deﬁnition of purchaser in the 2009 Act requires the
transaction to be for value and the deﬁnition includes a mortgagee.30 Thus B and C

30 Section 3.

After Registration

can overreach but Y cannot. The gift of Whiteacre from X to Y will not pose any
risk to U and his beneﬁcial interest will continue to affect the title to Whiteacre.
8.3.2
Effect of Overreaching
Section 21 was introduced because the 2009 Act provided that the only legal estates
capable of being created or disposed of are a freehold estate and a leasehold estate.
All other estates and interests take effect as equitable interests only.31 Thus trustees
are registered as owners and the interests of the beneﬁciaries are by way of an
equitable interest only and these are not registrable interests.32 They can, however,
be protected by registration of an inhibition. The position now in Ireland is that the
trust may not be evident from the title register unless an inhibition has been entered.
As demonstrated above Y will take subject to the interest but there is a risk for B
and C. If they are not aware of the existence of the trust then they may not comply
with the correct formalities and overreaching may not occur. There is no
corresponding risk in Ontario. The existence of the trust can be ignored as B and
C will take free of any claim. In Ontario U automatically becomes V when a sale or
transfer of the land occurs.
In Ireland the 2009 Act simpliﬁed and standardised property rights and thus
trusts were moved off the register. In implementing this change section 21 tried to
effect a compromise between ensuring that land held in trust is freely alienable and
protecting the interests of the beneﬁciaries in preserving their rights. The difﬁculty
with section 21 is that on a practical level the compromise may leave transferees
and lenders unwittingly subject to an equitable claim that was not evident from an
inspection of the title register or any other register.
Where there is no inhibition on the title register a single trustee can readily
hoodwink a purchaser into falling foul of section 21. Mee was critical of the original
provision in the Bill and expressed the view that it downgraded beneﬁcial interests
in family homes.33 He referred to the English system which requires two or more
trustees all of whom must execute the deed34 and notes that while a family
relationship is going well it is most unlikely that a non-owning partner will take
steps to register their beneﬁcial interest.35
31 Section 11 of the 2009 Act.
32 Property Registration Authority (2012).
33 Mee (2006), p. 71.
34 This is a reference to section 2(1) and section 27 of the Law of Property Act 1925.
35 Mee (2006), pp. 70–71. Mee does not deal with how this section interacts with the protection
provided by the Family Home Protection Act 1976 as amended and he obviously could not address
the provisions of the subsequently enacted Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of
Cohabitants Act 2010.
8.3
Destructive Effects of a Registered Transaction
253

The main thrust of the section is to protect transferees, by transferring the
interest of the beneﬁciary to the trust fund, but it appears to have failed somewhat
in achieving this. In Ontario even if the trust is evident from the register the
registered owner can deal with the property as if there were no such beneﬁcial
interest. The beneﬁciary is V and has no claim against the land. This policy is a
more deﬁnitive stance on the issue and has much to recommend it. B, Y and C take
free of the trust and the beneﬁciary V must seek recourse from the transferor and
trustee, A or X.
8.4
Rights Not Recognised
If rights are not recognised and not capable of registration then there is a risk posed
to U the third party and V the property claimant. Rights may not be recognised and
capable of registration for a number of reasons. The right may be a personal right
that cannot be converted into a property right. For example breach of a contract of
employment will result in an in personam claim and these type of claims fall
outside this examination.
Some rights fall outside the registration system in that they are not registrable
rights. Other rights may be rights that are capable of being registered but the claim
by V is not sufﬁciently mature to effect the land.
8.4.1
Easement
In Ontario easements, including rights of way, are overriding interests under section
44(1) paragraph 2 of the Land Titles Act but there is a caveat to this in section 44(3).
This provides that such rights are not overriding if notice of the application for ﬁrst
registration of the land was served on adjoining owners and no objection to the ﬁrst
registration was ﬁled. If no objection was ﬁled at the time the adjoining owner’s
easement is not protected as an overriding interest. This means that subsequent
transferees will not need to concern themselves with easements existing prior to
ﬁrst registration provided this notice was served.
After ﬁrst registration easements by prescription are prohibited by virtue of
section 51(1) of the Land Titles Act. This provides that no title, right or interest
can be acquired adverse to or in derogation of the title of the registered owner by
any length of possession or by prescription. In effect the Act prevents the maturing
of claims for adverse possession or easements and a matured prescriptive easement
may be lost if the owner does not contest the registration of the servient lands. This
position was conﬁrmed in 394 Lakeshore Oakville Holdings Inc. v. Misek.36 Thus
36 394 Lakeshore Oakville Holdings Inc. v. Misek 2010 CanLII 6007 (ON SC).
254
8
After Registration

after ﬁrst registration easements can only be obtained by express or implied grant
such as easements of necessity.
In Ireland the 2009 Act abolished the acquisition of an easement by prescription
at common law and provided that acquisition at law shall only arise on registration
of a court order under section 35(1). Section 40 does retain the right to an implied
grant, easements of necessity and the doctrine of non-derogation from grant.
Prospective purchasers require registration as section 39 provides that after
12 years continuous non-user the easement is extinguished unless protected by
registration.
Until extinguished the easement is protected as an overriding interest under
section 72(1)(h) of the 1964 Act unless created by express grant or reservation after
ﬁrst registration. Express grants or reservations can be registered as burdens under
section 69 of the 1964 Act. If the easement is not an overriding interest the threat
from a prospective purchaser to the easement requires it to be registered to secure
the right and avoid the possibility of extinguishment.
There is a contradiction between the 2009 Act which pushed towards registration
of easements and the 1964 Act which accords them status as overriding interests
binding the world. It is a shame that the opportunity presented for reform of the
general land and conveyancing law in 2009 did not also encompass the law on
registration (which was only reformed in part by the 2006 Act). Alignment and
consolidation of these twin pillars might make any future reforms more robust.37
The explanatory memorandum to the 2009 Act notes that section 35(1) was
designed to facilitate conveyancing by relieving purchasers of the need to make
enquiries or search for possible rights not mentioned in any documents of title as all
new rights acquired by prescription will have to be registered.38 However pur-
chasers will still have to enquire if a court order has been made but not yet
registered as such rights may be overriding interests and purchasers will also
have to enquire if any proceedings have been initiated.
This move to bring easements on to the register caused consternation in legal
circles as previously lawyers relied upon statutory declarations from prior owners
as to length of user.39 Now a deed or court order seemed to be required.40
The non-expressly granted easement is an important user right and the neighbour
is a monopoly supplier. Forcing the claimant to contract or obtain a court order
imposes cost and raised the possibility of a dispute. Servient owners could decline
to execute a deed and force the dominate owner to go to the expense of a court
application. This has been remedied somewhat by amending provisions in the Civil
37 It should be noted that landlord and tenant law also remains to be reformed. The Law Reform
Commission has published draft reforming legislation. See Law Reform Commission (2007). In
April 2011 a version of this draft Bill was published by the Department of Justice and Equality but

Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 201141 which allows the registrar to register
the easement when there is no dispute between the parties. Notice is served on all
interested parties and in the absence of the application being contested, registration
may proceed.42
Thus the dominant owner can avail of this simple procedure to register subject to
their being no objection by the servient owner who may be a friendly and
co-operative neighbour. This extension of the registrar’s power is in line with the
increased emphasis on title registration in the move towards eConveyancing.
Scenario 3(a)
U is claiming a right of way by prescription over Greenacre.
In Ontario U cannot claim a right based on prescription after ﬁrst registration of
the land and thus his claim will be rejected by the courts. U becomes V as his claim
is defeated. The right is not a registrable right and is not recognised.
In Ireland U will need to demonstrate 12 years user.43 If U does not have
sufﬁcient user to be successful in asserting his right his claim is not yet mature
and will not be recognised by the courts. U may be able to register a note on the
register temporarily, while proceedings are pending, but when the claim fails the
registrar will remove the note from the register. In the interim period the title is
effectively frozen as B would likely not purchase Greenacre until the matter is
resolved. U becomes V as his right is not recognised and cannot be registered
against the land.
If U can demonstrate 12 years user and his claim is successful the court order can
be registered as a burden under section 69(1)(h) of the 1964 Act. This will protect
his interest from extinguishment. This registration is required under section 35(1) of
the 2009 Act for a legal easement. If U does not register the court order he would
have an equitable easement. This is protected as an overriding interest under section
72(1)(h) of the 1964 Act.
The status of such a right as an overriding interest contradicts the aims of the
2009 Act in attempting to bring prescriptive easements onto the register. As noted
previously this demonstrates a lack of co-ordination between general conveyancing
law and the law in relation to registration of title and the detrimental effect of
piecemeal reform. Mee argues that more consideration should have been given to
developing a conception of how eConveyancing might work before settling on the
approach to reforming the substantive law.44

Scenario 3(b)
X expressly granted U a right of way over Whiteacre. This right is recognised in
Ontario and Ireland. The question of the right maturing does not arise as it comes
into being when the grant is executed.
In Ireland this right is not an overriding interest.45 Instead it is a burden which
may be registered as affecting registered land under section 69(1)(j) of the 1964
Act. The easement cannot be extinguished by 12 years non-user as section 39 of the
2009 Act only applies to those acquired by prescription or implied grant or
reservation.
If this was Greenacre U would be advised to register the easement in order for it
to survive a sale by A to B. In the case of Whiteacre as a volunteer Y will take
subject to all unregistered rights to which X held the land so it does not matter if U
failed to register the easement. It will survive the gift.
The easement was created after ﬁrst registration by way of express grant from
X. U can register a note of it on the register in Ontario under section 39(4) of the
Land Titles Act. If U fails to register it will still be protected as an overriding
interest under section 44(1) paragraph 2 and on a sale or transfer both a purchaser
for value and volunteer will be bound by the interest. In Ontario the easement is
treated the same as the tenancy in scenario 1. B, Y and C will take their respective
interests subject to the right of way.
8.4.2
Effect of Rights Not Recognised
Lyall notes that registration of title is not merely procedural, but affects substantive
law in a number of respects as it produces a new classiﬁcation of interests in land.46
This classiﬁcation of registered interests overlaps with the legal and equitable
estates and interests that can generally exist. Some legal and equitable estates and
interests will be capable of registration and others will not.
The prescriptive easement is not registrable and not recognised by the title
register in Ontario. In Ireland the prescriptive easement needs to be mature to affect
the title. The expressly granted easement is an overriding interest in Ontario but in
Ireland it is a burden which should be registered to survive a transfer from A to B.
The above scenarios demonstrate how third party rights are dealt with by the
registrations systems in Ireland and Ontario and the effect of those rights on other
participants in the land market. It is clear that registration systems do not deal with
or acknowledge all third party rights.
45 Section 72(1)(h) excludes easements created by express grant or reservation after ﬁrst
registration.

Rights Not Recognised

The title register is not a complete reﬂection of the title at any given moment47
and this can be viewed in a number of contexts. It may be seen as detracting from
the value of the register by adding enquiries and cost to conveyancing transactions.
As Stewart-Wallace puts it so articulately “[a] partial register is rather like a boat
with a leak in it. You may not be drowned, but you are sure to be uncomfortable.
The register must be ﬁnal and conclusive in all cases and for all purposes, or its
utility is diminished”.48
Woods is of the view that “[o]verriding interests, which operate to bind a
purchaser of registered land despite not appearing on the register, were not part
of Torrens’ original vision.”49 They are just one exception to indefeasibility which
negate the effectiveness of registration. By contrast, as noted already in Chap. 4,
Mason argues that indefeasibility does not mean, and has never meant, absolute
indefeasibility and that some of the problems with the Torrens system were “unreal
expectations of what the system of registered title would deliver, engendered by the
notion of indefeasible registered title.”50 He notes that when introduced in Australia
registration under the Torrens system was voluntary and that equitable unregistered
interests can be created in respect of registered land.51
A disparate view is offered by Park who believes the ideal espoused by the
originators of land title registration was that of a complete and comprehensive
register.52 To investigate and ascertain legal rights or obligations a person only
needed to inspect the register as “title is not affected by anything not shown on the
register. It is not only unnecessary but also impossible to establish a right in the land
by other means.”53 He notes however that this and other absolute statements
regarding the integrity of the various title registers are not justiﬁed as the register
is less than perfect and overriding interests exist which are not disclosed on the
supposedly conclusive register.54
47 In England and Wales the Law Commission has endorsed making the register a complete and
accurate reﬂection of the state of the title at any given time. See Law Commission and HM Land
Registry (2001), p. 2.

8.5
Effect of eConveyancing
The changes being implemented to advance eConveyancing bring a different
perspective to these debates. While the scenarios above demonstrate transactional
risk, illuminated by the model, the imperative of eConveyancing can reveal other
systemic risks.
In Ontario, Ireland and England and Wales it is widely acknowledged that
eConveyancing can only be implemented in respect of registered land and this
has led to an accelerated push to complete the title register. For example the Ontario
e-reg system has only been introduced for registered titles. This generally means
there is no further attempt to keep the registered and unregistered systems in line
with each other.55
There is one exception to this widely held view. Arrun˜ada says it is easer to fully
automate a registry of deeds rather than a register of rights stricto senso in which
only purged, clean titles are entered.56 He is of the view that agency registration,
i.e. an automatic system, will debase a registry of rights into a recording of deeds
given the imperative to speed up registration.57
It is easier to fully automate a deeds system because it lacks a register of rights
and thus Arrun˜ada warns “there is a risk that the introduction of electronic regis-
tration inadvertently interferes with the broader decision about the choice of titling
system”.58 This view that eRegistration will push towards deeds registration is an
interesting perspective as most commentators feel that eConveyancing can only
take place in respect of registered titles. In many jurisdictions and contrary to
Arrun˜ada’s view it has led to a push from deeds to title registration.
Thus Arrun˜ada’s perspective has not found favour. This may be due to the fact
that to date no jurisdiction has reduced the protection offered by its registry in order
to speed up registration thus debasing the register of rights into a recording of
deeds. In Ontario for example new improved classes of title were created instead.59
While Arrun˜ada may be correct that it is easier to automate a registry of deeds,
many jurisdictions embracing eConveyancing initiatives have instead chosen to
advance their title register at the expense of the deeds register. This advancement
has focused attention on completion of the title register and also on its efﬁciency.
Both Ireland and Ontario have made signiﬁcant movement towards extending the
title register to all land parcels. This focus on completion of the title register is not
just limited to its geographical spread. It also impacts on the very nature of title and

how rights are categorised. The aim is not just to extend the register to the entire
land mass but also to all rights and interests,60 or at least those deemed worthy of
protection by the registry. This can be described as both a wide extension and a deep
intension of registration.
Such changes have the potential to signiﬁcantly effect how the registration
system deals with rights and interests and particularly the type of third party rights
examined earlier in this chapter.
8.5.1
Moving Rights on to the Register
Under eConveyancing it will be registration, and registration alone, that will
‘create’ a property right.61
The overall effect is to weld concepts of ‘title’, ‘estate’ and ‘proprietor’ into a form of
statutory ownership of land which begins to resemble the civilian model of proprietorship.
The ‘registered proprietor’ now holds a ‘registered title’ which is inseparable from – indeed
has no meaning apart from – the ‘registered estate’ in the ‘registered land’ to which it
relates.62
This increased emphasis on registration involves an examination of all rights and
interests to see if those off the register should be moved on to the title register. The
aim is to make the register deﬁnitive, conclusive and all encompassing.63 This
move towards certainty comes at the expense of some land owners. Any change in
categorisation may have a positive or negative impact. An interest previously not
given the protection of registration may be deemed sufﬁciently important to be
reclassiﬁed as a right capable of registration. A right which previously affected
without registration may now require registration and thus the land owner will need
to comply with the required formalities. A right previously protected by registration
or which affected without registration may no longer be deemed worthy of protec-
tion and may be cast out. This would be a signiﬁcant policy shift and raises the issue
of compensation for the loss.64
Any reclassiﬁcation of property rights poses a risk to all land owners. Some
rights may be downgraded and others upgraded. The interests currently not
protected by registration may, on a review, be deemed worthy of being reclassiﬁed
60 Deeney notes that it will be necessary to have the title to all estates and interests affecting
registered land registered in the title register and this will necessarily mean a fundamental review
of the conclusiveness of the register as such an extension of the register might have implications
for the state guarantee i.e. the compensation provisions. See Deeney (2014), p. 366. This aspect is
explored further at Sect. 9.6.

as rights capable of registration. U and V may beneﬁt from a change in the
legislation. Until this reclassiﬁcation is completed the rights held by U and V are
subject to increased risk. The danger is that they will be deemed as not being
sufﬁciently important to be reﬂected on the new all encompassing register and thus
will be deemed not to be recognised as rights.65
There is also the possibility of other interests or even estates in land being
examined and challenged. The likelihood of this occurring, however, is slim. It is
one thing to remove third party rights but it is quite another to remove from land
owners or lenders rights which were previously capable of registration. Such a
major re categorisation would throw the entire conveyancing system into disarray.
A reclassiﬁcation of property rights to make the register deﬁnitive and all
encompassing would mean being true to one of the original principles of title
registration i.e. the register being a mirror of the title.66 Such a reclassiﬁcation
could mean that any rights on the register would be protected and any rights not on
the register would not. In effect equitable interests and overriding interests would
no longer be enforceable and those holding such interests would have no remedies
and no protection.
Following the arrival of electronic conveyancing it will not be possible to generate or
dispose of most interests except by means of some contemporaneous entry in the register.
Unregistered transactions will, quite simply, have no effect either at law or in equity. . ..
entitlement will be conferred by ‘registration and registration alone’.67
In referring to overriding interests Deeney is of the view that the difﬁculties in
mapping, establishing title, registering and updating such interests would far
outweigh the beneﬁts to be gained by their entry on the register.68 Murphy also
sees difﬁculties and refers to the need for the electronic register to be capable of
recording all rights and interests as “the Achilles heel of eConveyancing”.69
However Deeney notes that in order to successfully implement eConveyancing it
will be necessary to have the title to all estates and interests affecting registered land
registered in the register and the provisions relating to burdens which affect without
registration will have to be repealed.70
Attempting to enter all interests onto this all encompassing title register would
be a challenging task, possibly involving delay and expense. Those holding such
interests are generally given an interim period to register their interest but if
registration does not occur within the time given then the interest is deemed to be

lost or may only be enforced as a personal right.71 Alternatively old rights could be
protected independently but all new rights of the same type refused and then
eventually those types of rights would fade away.
Hansmann and Kraakman express the view that the recognition of new classes of
property rights generally involves a shift in wealth towards the user of those rights
at the expense of nonusers and society at large or whoever bears the system costs for
the new rights.72 Thus reforms promoting or abolishing property rights are likely to
be inﬂuenced strongly by different interest groups.73
Thus it is important to ask a number of questions. Is it reasonable to expect all
parties to register their rights even if those rights arise informally such as by virtue
of occupation, under a constructive trust or by estoppel? Or are there circumstances
where it is reasonable to give protection to interests off the register? Can
eConveyancing truly be effective without a complete title register that encompasses
all rights, interests and estates in land? Or should it be accepted that the title register
is not capable of dealing equitably with all interests in land and there will be an ever
expanding

of

interests

8.5.2
Interest Recording
Some jurisdictions have tried to mitigate the impact of increasing the categories of
off register interests by providing for interest recording systems to be combined
with title registration. This was recommended in 1990 by the Canadian Joint Land
Titles Committee Renovating the Foundation: Proposals for a Model Land Record-
ing and Registration Act for the Provinces and Territories of Canada.74 The
Committee was of the view that “the law cannot effectively guarantee ownership
of all interests in land and would seriously mislead people if it were to try extend
title registration to all interests.”75 It would not be appropriate to register an almost
indeﬁnite range of estates and interests.76 The Committee also expressed the view
that title registration should not change substantive real property law but instead

recommendations. This Committee favoured discretionary indefeasibility in order to achieve fair
results. See Mason (2003), p. 18. Mason is inclined to agree that it might generate fairer results but
was not sure if the beneﬁts would outweigh the detriments of change, particularly as there would
be uncertainty for a signiﬁcant period of time as to how the courts would exercise the discretion.

“should ﬂoat upon the general law.”77 This Committee included representatives
from Ontario but its main recommendations have not been adopted there.78
November and Rendell note that such interest recording confers priority, but
does not in itself confer ownership, while title registration conﬁrms priority and
ownership.79 Unregistered interests are recorded on the title register but are not
actually registered. This could be seen as an amalgam of the title register and deeds
register systems. Does such a proposal accept the distinction between unregistered
rights and title registration and reinforce it? The reality is that many jurisdictions
already operate forms of interest recording within title registration.
Australia has caveat provisions which allow for the protection of equitable
interests.80 New Zealand has a limited example of such a system with its notiﬁca-
tion of restrictive and positive covenants on the title register.81 Though the beneﬁt
of a covenant or easement does not constitute a claim of ownership to the burdened
land so the difference may be in the nature of the claim rather than the status of any
registered entry. A recording may be a means of accommodating all types of
equitable interests within the system or only have the short term function of
protecting interests prior to their registration. The former may not require that the
interest be registrable82 in its own right.
Both Ontario and Ireland already operate limited forms of interest recording. In
Ireland those holding unregistered interests in registered land or registered charges
may protect them by registering a caution or inhibition.83 A caution is for the
temporary protection of an unregistered right84 pending its conversion into a
registered interest.85 It restricts any disposition by the registered owner without
notice to the cautioner. No notice is required for dealings by someone other than the
registered owner. A transfer for value will be stayed pending litigation by the
cautioner to establish their right as the registrar does not decide between the relative
77 Joint Land Titles Committee (1990), p. 19.
78 Where registration is based on a forged or unauthorised transfer the Model Act leaned in favour
of restoring a displaced registered owner and compensating the innocent successor of the fraud-
ulent party as the displaced owner is statistically likely to have a closer connection with the land
and to suffer loss which will be harsher as well as greater and less easy to quantify, than the loss
suffered by the recent acquirer of the interest. See Joint Land Titles Committee (1990), pp. 3 and
25.

merits of each side.86 A transfer to a volunteer would however be registered as a
volunteer will take subject to any unregistered rights. This is a strong limit on the
register and means that there is no general principle of immediate indefeasibility as
some titles are clearly defeasible i.e. those of volunteers.
Unregistrable rights that cannot be converted into registered rights can be
protected by an inhibition.87 It will usually restrict transactions without certain
consent or within a speciﬁed time period. For example it may protect beneﬁciaries
under a trust. In the case of a conﬂict the registrar will prevent any registration
pending a determination by the court. Another means of protection is provided by a
priority entry88 and this has already been examined in Chap. 6.
Section 69 of the 1964 Act also lists burdens that may be registered as ‘record-
ings’ against registered title. The title held by C is a clear example of this as its
charge cannot be registered its own right, it can only be registered as an encum-
brance against B’s registered title. Some, but not all of these, are U interests and V
claims thus allowing for entries on the title register that may protect U and V.
Similarly in Ontario under section 71(1) of the Land Titles Act any person
entitled to or interested in any unregistered estates, rights, interests or equities in
registered land may protect same by entering a notice, caution, inhibition or other
restriction on the register. Where this is done every registered owner and every
person deriving title through the registered owner, except prior owners, are bound
by notice. Again this restriction only prevents the interest being impaired by an act
of the registered owner.
Those claiming to have an interest in registered land or in a registered charge can
apply for registration of a caution to prevent dealings without the consent of the
cautioner.89 This can be used to prevent dealings both by the registered owner or
any other person named in the caution however it expires after 60 days and cannot
be renewed. A registered owner can also place a restriction on the register to
prevent a transfer or charge without notice, consent or the doing of some other
matter or thing.90
Thus such a recording or caveat on the title91 may take the form of a caution,
inhibition, priority search or registration of an encumbrance. Any such recording
gives a warning to potential purchasers. It may not confer any validity on the
interest but it will prevent registration of a dealing that affects the interest of the
person who made the recording.
November and Rendell express the view that interest-recording is a relatively
blunt way to protect unregistered interests and requires a person to be aware of the

existence of the interest in order to record it.92 They note the potential problem of
making conveyancing more complex if the distinction between recording and
registration becomes blurred.93
To date the distinction does not appear to have caused any great difﬁculty for
lawyers but such interest recording may need to be examined if unregistered
interests themselves are under scrutiny in the move toward eConveyancing.
Could C’s ﬁrst legal charge be upgraded from an encumbrance to an interest
capable of registration in its own right perhaps facilitating wealth generation and
an improved market in land?94 This has echoes in the recent creation by the Irish
registering authority of a new register of charges taken over by the National Asset
Management Agency (NAMA).95
Could those holding overriding interests be required to register them as ‘record-
ings’? Should someone in occupation be required to register even though such
occupation is surely apparent to any transferee who inspects the property? A
complete ‘recording’ system linked to title registration would need to be mandatory
and to bind the world to truly be of beneﬁt to transferees relying on it as a
comprehensive reﬂection of the title. Recording only would be effective to protect
unregistered interests and other forms of notice, such as from inspection, thus
become irrelevant.
8.5.3
Reclassiﬁcation of Interests in land
Some interests have already been reclassiﬁed. An example arises in Ireland with the
removal of the status of land certiﬁcates and certiﬁcates of charge which was driven
by the dematerialisation aspect of eConveyancing.
Prior to 1 January 2007 the Land Registry would on request issue a land
certiﬁcate. This was an important document of title and was required to be produced
if there was any change in registration. Section 73 of the 2006 Act, which came into
effect on 1 January 2007, provided that these certiﬁcates would no longer be issued.
All existing certiﬁcates ceased to have effect from 1 January 2010 and in the
intervening 3 year period a person who held a lien through deposit or possession

established in 2009 as a means of addressing the problem with Ireland’s banking sector created by
excessive lending. The agency acquired loans with a nominal value of 74 billion from participating
ﬁnancial institutions. Note that the registration of NAMA is not compulsory and any transfer to
NAMA takes effect as a deed registered on the date on which it took effect. See Deeney
(2014), p. 351.

of such a certiﬁcate could apply to the registrar to have a lien registered as a burden
on the folio. Section 73 related similarly to certiﬁcates of charge.
Thus as of 1 January 2010 it was no longer possible to create an equitable charge
on registered land by lodgement of the land certiﬁcate with a lender. Any lender
previously holding such a charge was given 3 years to protect their interest by
registering it on the folio. Any lender who did not exercise this right was left
holding a worthless document and an interest that could no longer be enforced.96 In
effect a type of security that was low in cost, easy and quick to effect was abolished
despite the fact that it was commercially valuable. Lenders must now take the risk
of unsecured credit or put the borrower to the expense of putting a charge in place.
This demonstrates how a party may lose their claim by not registering within the
time allowed and collectively a category of land owners may lose their claim if their
right or interest is no longer recognised by the registration system. There is an
inherent risk in registration systems and these risks are ampliﬁed in any reclassi-
ﬁcation of what the system protects.
A clear example is the change to trusts introduced by the 2009 Act97 whereby the
distinction between registration as ‘full owner’ and registration as ‘limited owner’
was abolished. Limited owners can no longer be registered owners, their ownership
being an equitable interest only.98 This means that such limited owners, whether a
minor or someone holding a life interest, remainder or reversion, no long have
power to transfer legal title. Trustees are registered as owners and the interests of
the beneﬁciaries are not registrable interests.99
Another example of reclassiﬁcation is provided in the case of rent charges which
were previously capable of registration as a section 69 burden. Section 4 of the 2009
Act provided that such rent charges are only enforceable as a simple contract debt.
The Act also prohibited the future creation of rent charges in law or in equity except
those created by the court or under statutory provision. Thus a “commonplace
registration”100 was no longer possible i.e. where an annuity is payable to a donor
by a donee.
Other interests may not be lost but may be downgraded or rendered inferior in
the process or indeed there may be a perception among consumers, legal pro-
fessionals and the market place that the new interest is inferior even if the reality
is very different. In Ontario the protection offered by the registry has been extended
in the move towards electronic services with the automation and conversion of
registry records. This is reﬂected in the creation of two new types of registered
titles.101
96 The Act did contain compensation provisions to protect vulnerable people whose right might be
extinguished without their knowledge but no applications for such compensation have been made.

The new land title parcels are “commonly referred to as “Qualiﬁed Land Titles”
among real estate practitioners, with the connotation that the parcel is inferior to an
Absolute title” or traditional land title parcel.102 The LT Plus and LTCQ are
however both qualiﬁed to a lesser degree than the previously best title available
i.e. the absolute title. Murray says it is unfortunate that these parcels are referred to
as “Qualiﬁed”103 as the guarantees given mean that for most conveyancing pur-
poses they are superior to absolute title.104 Thus eConveyancing may lead to an
improvement in the quality of registered titles being offered by the registry.
eConveyancing may also require the development of a different system of
principles to determine the circumstances in which it is possible to acquire title to
registered land by adverse possession. This reﬂects “the fact that the basis of title in
a registered system is the fact of registration and not possession as it is in an
unregistered system”105 This enhances the status of registration which becomes an
integral and essential part of the conveyancing process.106
Thus jurisdictions such as England and Wales have because of the conclusive
nature of registration, in an eConveyancing environment, severely restricted the
circumstances in which a squatter can acquire title to registered land by adverse
possession.107 Gray and Gray refer to this as illustrating “the emergence of a much
more robust and deeply stabilised form of state-endorsed title.”108 The Land
Registration Act 2002 reduced the scope and number of overriding interests,
created some new registrable interests and introduced a new regime for adverse
possession based on the premise that registration and registration alone confers
title.109 Dixon points to schedules 1 and 3 of this Act as having enhanced free
alienability of land110 by reducing the number of overriding interests111 in the move
towards an eConveyancing system with a near complete electronic register.112

Ontario has gone even further and has provided that no claim for adverse
possession can be made in respect of registered land unless rights were acquired
before the lands were brought into the registered title system. The Law Reform
Commission in Ireland has also made radical proposals113 in relation to adverse
possession but these proposals have not yet been introduced into legislation.114 In
particular the draft Bill produced by the Law Reform Commission requires that the
court grant a vesting order which must be registered on the title register even in the
case of unregistered land. This it notes will be one way of extending registration of
titles.115
As mentioned previously116 this extension of registration can be described as
both a wide extension and a deep intension. It is linked to the expansion of the role
of the registering authority beyond its traditional remit.117 An example of such
expansion in Ireland is the creation of a register of charges taken over by NAMA.118
These reforms may be looked at in the context of a drive towards a stricter
numerus clausus and the implications this may have on the operation of the land
market.119 As noted in Chap. 2, it is more difﬁcult to build an electronic system that
is ﬂexible enough to accommodate estates and interests that may not be determined
for some years to come.120 The move towards eConveyancing may trigger further
examination and reclassiﬁcation of interests in land thus creating risk for all those
holding, to trying to assert, such interests.
The Irish legislature does not however have an unfettered right to interfere with
the land market at will. Two factors may impede any reclassiﬁcation of property
rights particularly where there may be a lessening of protection for particular
interests. Firstly the constitutional protection given to property rights in Ireland
and secondly Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.121
Two provisions of the 1937 Constitution are of relevance.122 The ﬁrst is Article
40.3 and the second is Article 43.

1. The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend
and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.
2. The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in
the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of
every citizen.
In Article 43 the State both acknowledges the right to private property and
asserts that this right may be curtailed by the State in certain circumstances.
Under the heading ‘Private Property’ Article 43 states as follows:
1.1 The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right,
antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.
1.2 The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of
private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property.
2.1 The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing
provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of
social justice.
2.2. The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said
rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.
Article 43 deﬁnes the attitude of the State to the concept of private ownership,
acknowledges that a natural right to private ownership exists and that the State will
not attempt of abolish this right or the associated right to transfer, bequeath and
inherit property. The Article does however recognise that the State may as occasion
requires delimit by law the exercise of this right with a view to reconciling their
exercise with the exigencies of the common good. Thus Article 43 prohibits the
abolition of private property as an institution but permits, in certain circumstances,
the regulation of the exercise of the right to private property. Article 43 does not
deal with a citizen’s right to a particular item of property. This is dealt with in
Article 40.3 as a person right.
The relationship between these two articles was explored in the seminal cases of
Madigan v Attorney General123 and Blake and Ors v Attorney General124 which
examined parts of the Rent Restrictions Act 1960. The Rent Restrictions Acts,
1960–1981 placed a statutory restriction on the rents payable by tenants of dwelling
houses with rateable valuations which did not exceed speciﬁed sums. The Supreme
Court held that part of the Rent Restrictions Act 1960 was an unconstitutional
interference with the property rights of landlords as the Act restricted the exercise
of these rights without providing for compensation and did so for the beneﬁt of
tenants without taking into account the ﬁnancial means of either landlords or
tenants.125 The two actions were heard together in High Court and subsequently
on appeal by the Attorney General in the Supreme Court.
The Court found that the provisions of Part 2 of the 1960 Act did restrict the
property rights of one group of citizens for the beneﬁt of another. The restriction
was held to be both “unfair and arbitrary” on the basis that it applied only to some

houses and dwellings and not to others, that the basis for the selection was not
related to any established social necessity and the restriction applied without
compensation and without regard to the ﬁnancial capacity or the ﬁnancial needs
of either group. O’Higgins C.J. stated that the legislation could only escape the
description of being unfair and unjust by including some adequate compensatory
factor for those whose rights were so arbitrarily and detrimentally affected.
However in the later cases of Dreher v Irish Land Commission126 and
O’Callaghan v The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland127 the Irish Courts
have accepted the principle that every case of infringement of a citizen’s property
rights does not require compensation at market value. This issue has also arisen at a
European level when land owners have appealed to the European Court of Human
Rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Wylie cites the case of Mellacher v Austria128 as evidence that it is doubtful any
further protection, over and above that in the Irish Constitution, for property rights
is given by Article 1.129 In that case the European Court of Human Rights ruled that
rent reductions introduced by Austria’s Rent Act 1981 did not violate Article 1.
Article 1 provides that:
Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No
one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the
conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The
preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a state to enforce
such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the
general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
In James v United Kingdom130 the landlords of property in Belgravia, London
alleged that the compulsory transfer of the property under the Leasehold Reform
Act 1967 as amended gave rise to a breach of Article 1. This Act provides tenants
residing in houses on long leases with the right to purchase compulsorily the
freehold on prescribed terms subject to prescribed conditions. The Court found
that the leasehold reform legislation was not ipso facto an infringement of Article
1 merely because the immediate beneﬁciaries of the compulsory transfer of prop-
erty it empowers are private parties. A taking of property effected in pursuance of
legitimate social, economic or other policies may be in the public interest even if
the community at large has no direct use or enjoyment of the property.
The Court felt that the margin of appreciation available to the national legisla-
ture in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and thus
would respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the public interest unless
that judgment was manifestly without reasonable foundation. In the Court’s view

Article 1 did not guarantee a right to full compensation as the legitimate objectives
of public interest, such as pursued in economic reforms or righting social
disequilibria, might call for less than full reimbursement of the market value.
Deputy McDowell, in a discussion about the Irish ground rents legislation,131
pointed out in the Da´il that
[p]roperty rights do not necessarily carry with them constitutional immunity for change or
abrogation or conversion to something else. . .. If it can be shown and demonstrated that the
common good is served by the extinction of certain property rights in certain circumstances
then that can be done.132
Professor Sweeney in referring to the same legislation after its enactment stated
that
[i]t is not as revolutionary as one might think that, in the public interest, property rights
should be interfered with without notice to the owner. . .. Here we are concerned not merely
with interference with property rights but with their actual acquisition, an acquisition not
required in the interests of the health and safety of the public but required rather as a
necessary solution to a vast conveyancing problem with a socio-economic dimension.133
Thus both the Irish and European courts permit state regulation of property
rights provided the legislation serves the common good and does not amount to an
unjust attack on those rights. In addition it is clear that both the Irish and European
courts have accepted the principle that land owners may not automatically be
entitled to full compensation.134
Even if compensation is to be paid this can be problematic. Land owners value
land differently depending on their perspective. They may value the property as the
price paid on the open market, the revenue from renting, the construction cost or the
‘emotional value’ of a home.
8.5.4
An (In)complete Title Register
The commentary on overriding interests and other ‘off-register’ interests provides a
clear demonstration of the debate between those that support a complete title
register and those that see a beneﬁt in having some interests which affect title off
the register.
O’Connor notes that the term overriding interest
does not designate a homogenous group of interests. It is best understood as a legislative
device for subjecting registered titles to interests that are deemed worthy of ‘passive’

protection, in circumstances where the persons entitled to the beneﬁt of the interests cannot
reasonably be expected to enter them on the register.135
In a more detailed examination136 she breaks them down into transitional
safeguards against errors in ﬁrst registration, those arising from legislation that
create taxes, rates or other charges in favour of public agencies, interests where the
cost is disproportionate to the beneﬁts of registering e.g. short term occupation
tenancies and those that it would be inconvenient or unreasonable to expect people
to register e.g. created informally, public rights or those that have become obscure
with the passage of time. She notes that there is no general criterion for determining
when a right should override registered title.137
Often the criteria are based on achieving a public goal via the registration
process.
National laws prescribe stringent, multi-step procedures that must be followed to achieve a
legally valid transfer of ownership. These restrictions are intended ﬁrst and foremost to
protect the parties involved, but also to further other public goals.138
Examples include where land owners cannot register their title until tax is
paid.139 In some jurisdictions interested parties must produce certiﬁcation from a
public agency by way of permission before registration can occur in order to ensure
that the transaction does not negatively affect the public goals.140
The most usual category of overriding interests arise in relation to rights of those
in occupation or in receipt of rents and proﬁts. In Boyle v. Connaughton141 the court
found that the plaintiff was aware of the defendant’s actual occupation of part of his
lands before the transfer and thus the plaintiff’s title was subject to the rights of the
defendant.142 If the plaintiff had not visited the property or asked about such rights
he would still have been bound. If, however, he enquired and the rights were not
disclosed then the rights would not have been overriding. In Ireland non disclosure
by the right holder where the overriding interest is contingent upon occupation will
mean that the interest is not overriding.143

142 This overriding interest is listed at section 72(1)(j) of the 1964 Act. Breen states that the right
which accrued to the beneﬁt of the defendants in this case was the right to rectiﬁcation of the
register. She explores whether a right to rectiﬁcation is itself an overriding interest. See Breen
(2000), pp. 52–57. However, it should be noted that the Court in this case also found that there was
a mistake in mapping and the actual rectiﬁcation involved correction of those maps. See Murphy
(2013), p. 26 for details of an attempt to repeal this provision which was not successful.

After Registration

In The Right Honourable The Lord Mayor Aldermen and Burgesses of Dublin
v. Burke144 Geoghegan, J. was of the view that during the registration gap the
respondent purchaser, only held an unregistered right and thus, in a sense, the
question of section 72 burdens did not yet arise but if the appellant held a tenancy
on the property the purchaser’s unregistered right would be subject to it.
It is one thing for the legislature and courts to permit such protection in certain
circumstances but it is quite another for them to actively encourage the proliferation
of such overriding interests.
[T]he complexity of modern law, with its multiplication of rights, often makes apparently
simple cases more complex than they appear. For instance, the increasing number and
variety of rights that have been granted over the family home to spouses who are not owners
make it necessary to collect their consents; otherwise, the acquirers’ titles would be
burdened with overriding interests.145
In Ireland a spouse’s consent is required for sale of a family home and in the case
of other property a declaration is obtained.
Park asks how people are to ascertain such interests that are not recorded and
why a registered title system permits such off-register interests.146 He blames the
legislature for enacting statutes providing for exceptions to the fundamental prin-
ciple of a complete and comprehensive register and also the courts in their inter-
pretation of those statutes.147 The thrust of title registration is to provide
transparency and certainty and thus enhance transferability thereby encouraging
commerce and trade in land. But legislation has subjugated the interests of trans-
ferees by providing for categories of overriding interests.
The aim of the register as a “bridge that transports. . .[the transferee] safely
across the morass of trusts and equities through which the purchaser of unregistered
land must struggle at his peril”148 has surely been defeated by the existence of such
overriding interests.
The fact that there is a category of property right that can bind a purchaser of a registered
title without either that interest appearing on the register or necessarily being discoverable
is thought by many to be an anathema to the very idea of a registration system.149
This category of interests is capable of surviving a disposition of the legal title
and binding a transferee notwithstanding the fact that they were not registered. The
“effect of such interests has been to limit the absolute protection afforded to a
purchaser who examines the register.”150 If there are always rights that must be

protected without registration, then the register will never be capable of giving an
absolutely accurate reﬂection of the title at any given point in time. It will never
fulﬁll the mirror principle.151
Stubkjær and his colleagues note that it
is tempting for the legislator to burden the transfer of ownership in real estate with various
other social goals. It seems difﬁcult to achieve an assessment of the beneﬁts and compare
them with the cost: they ﬂuctuate according to politics and with the times. Whether or not
the costs outweigh the beneﬁts is a political matter.152
The enquiries necessary to close off a threat from overriding interests may add
cost to conveyancing transactions but this cost on its own is unlikely to prevent the
operation of the land market. It is really a question of the extent to which that
market can be trusted. If costs are higher due to the risk of overriding interests then
this may discourage non-acquisition mortgages. Land owners will however still
move home and thus will require acquisition mortgages. If land can be bought and
sold it will be traded even if it is slow and expensive. The costs would need to be
prohibitive to affect the volume of transactions to any degree.
Dixon is of the view that there is nothing inherently wrong with a category of
non-registrable binding right, even in a system of land registration, “provided that
the category is well-bounded, well known and can be justiﬁed by reference to some
stronger legal, social or economic need.”153 He refers to the rights of those in
occupation as deserving of such protection. Fitzgerald is similarly of the view that
overriding interests are a useful and necessary compromise between the ideal and
the practical in a public register of title.154
Deeney however is of the view that a prerequisite of an electronic system would
be the repeal of the legislative provisions relating to overriding interests.155 Murphy
also questions the role played by such overriding interests in the current taxonomy
of property rights so as to give them protection within an eConveyancing system
but argues that any attempt to abolish those rights should be approached with
caution as they “bring about a just and equitable order to a registered title.”156
This is a key point. Does the imperative of legal, social or economic need
outweigh the values of certainty, transparency and efﬁciency in land transfer?
The latter would be enhanced if the register was both the sole and exclusive
evidence and the origin of a person’s title.157 The former would dictate that there
are certain rights which should be protected without entry on the register.

The existence of such overriding interests adds to the cost for all parties by
expanding the administrative burden, reducing efﬁciency, adding uncertainty, time
and work.
[T]he possibility of hidden property rights increases the information asymmetry between
the conveying parties: the seller knows better than the acquirer about hidden property
rights. More generally, the need to know which conﬂicting property rights exist, ﬁnding out
who their right holders are, bargaining with such right holders to obtain their consent and
contracting or somehow formalizing an agreement with them, all increase the costs of
transforming and conveying rights. This may in turn hamper investment, trade and
specialization.158
The beneﬁts of a ‘clean’ complete, deﬁnitive register is to be balanced against
one which protects latent rights.
The impact of eConveyancing on land registration brings a different perspective
to these issues.
The very point of e-conveyancing where the act of electronic registration is to be the act of
creation or transfer of a property right would be undone if it were possible to claim
protection for rights created off-register through a substantial category of overriding
interests.159
Overriding interests run contrary to the policy aims of eConveyancing.160
The goal of conveyancing reform is that the process should be capable of being
conducted by computer and “[i]f that goal is to be achieved, the role of over-riding
interests must be reduced to a bare minimum.”161 Harpum also notes that the goal of
making the register, in so far as possible, be an accurate reﬂection of the state of the
title at any given moment “can be achieved only if over-riding interests are
eliminated as far as possible.”162 Elimination means to remove the protection
currently given to these interests however an alternative would be to require these
interests to be put on the register and protected by registration.163 This would
involve a reclassiﬁcation of such interests as mentioned previously.
If overriding interests were eliminated any interest not reﬂected on the register
would not be enforceable against a bona ﬁde purchaser for value. Overriding
interests as a category of interests in land would no longer exist and the title register
would become deﬁnitive, conclusive and all encompassing.164
Demands for certainty, transparency and efﬁciency mean that the continued
existence of overriding interests is thrown into doubt. On a scale of eliminate,

reduce, keep the status quo or expand, eConveyancing reform drives towards
reduction and elimination. If overriding interests are eliminated as a category of
right “[t]he role of the traditional methods of investigating title, including on-site
inspections, will therefore become largely obsolete.”165 There would be no need for
enquiries about occupation or declarations to be sought relating to rights off the
register. This would make the conveyancing process more efﬁcient and could lead
to reduced costs.
However this has the potential for the register to become entirely removed from
reality on the ground. The true ownership may in fact not be reﬂected in the register
at all and if so, there is a danger of the land market operating in the dead capital,
extralegal sector referred to by De Soto.166 The elimination of such overriding
interests would not be welcomed by tax authorities, those holding easements167 or
short term tenancies and, in particular, is likely to be vigorously opposed by social
activists given the impact on spouses in occupation.
The question arises as to whether one single form (title registration) can fulﬁl
multiple principles; the security of debt, a land owner’s autonomy of disposition,
protection for those who contribute to the purchase price, protection of occupation
rights and so on. The difﬁcult is that right holders with legislative inﬂuence and
commercial power, e.g. revenue collection and lenders, tend to gain an unwarranted
level of protection. Those who are not organised such as transferors, transferees and
spouses may be neglected.
If the register is to fulﬁl all functions then it would be necessary to put temporary
rights on and off very quickly. There would need to be incentives to do so otherwise
the register will be cluttered and will quickly be out of date. Instead of having to
search for the possible existence of rights off the register participants would need to
spend time and money checking the rights on the register to see if they are still
relevant.
If overriding interests as a category of rights was removed the status of the
register would be enhanced but this would reduce, and perhaps even remove, the
freedom of the courts and land owners to create and enforce new rights. It could
lead to a lack of ﬂexibility that in the long term could undermine the register and
force land owners to ﬁnd alternative means of dealing with title to land.
The risks and rewards of erasing overriding interests are extremely difﬁcult to
quantify. There is a need to balance speciﬁc interest groups with the overall interest
of society in having a ﬂuid land market. The change may beneﬁt some participants
but not others and it raises questions about the overall purpose behind control of
land and how that control is reﬂected in land and registration policy. “The result of

The question arises as to what those objectives are. Do we value the use of land
as a home169 and place of shelter or does its value lie in monetary terms as a
commodity that can be realised and transacted, and whose interests do we wish to
protect?
Property rights in land and buildings, as deﬁned in private law, do not give the right holder
the (total) control that is sometimes assumed. In the general interest of society (or at least of
the administration) the control of the right holder over his property is limited in many
ways.170
How the land market is structured will meet the objectives society has deﬁned as
important but such structure needs to be balanced so as not to place an undue burden
solely on any one of the parties. It must be remembered that title registration is a
considerable public investment and is, of itself, an interference in how the land
market is structured. It provides for a category of registered interests that is overlaid
on top of the estates, rights and interests that can generally exist.
So there is precedent for signiﬁcant reform of interests in land and how they can
be enforced but there are many considerations that must be taken into account in
any restructuring.
Clancy argues that a multi-purpose register might solve the problem. “Only
those rights appearing in the register would create interests that attached to the
land.”171 This is one option if one accepts that not all rights are capable of
registration on the title register. There would still be the difﬁculty of getting
overriding interests onto this multi-purpose register. This is likely to be just as
problematic as getting them onto the title register and a more effective long term
option is reform.
O’Connor notes that this could lead to a two-tier interest registration and interest
recording system whereby
[c]ertain classes of interests, such as legal fee simple and major leasehold estates, would be
registered with a full State guarantee, as at present. Lesser interests, including many that are
presently unregistrable, would obtain priority upon being recorded in the register, but
would not attract a State guarantee. This is because it is uneconomic for registries to
examine and assume the risk of interests that are of short duration or are variable in their
incidents.172
It may be argued that in a modern developed society citizens are sufﬁciently
educated so they should be required to register their rights in order to gain the

protection of the state. Should overriding interests be destroyed by registration of a
transfer unless the claimant took action to enter a caveat or assert their right in
court? Should they be treated like prior unregistered interests which are destroyed
by ﬁrst registration? Or does such an approach take advantage of the most vulner-
able in society?
These arguments for and against a complete title register reﬂect the conﬂict
between certainty and ﬂexibility of the registration system. If the system is too rigid
it is felt that participants will operate outside the land market but if the system is too
ﬂexible it will introduce uncertainty. Are the rights to be protected limited in nature
or does the legislature permit new rights to be created? The 2007 Registering the
World conference report suggested that in the future land registries might be called
upon to recognise and record information about climate change, energy ratings,
public utilities information, topography, infrastructure such as cables and pipes,
carbon trading, water rights, mining tenure leases and in some jurisdictions native
title rights.173
New rights being created is a threat to legal certainty but gives the system
ﬂexibility. The system of rights creation and transfer can thus adapt to the ever
changing needs of society.
8.5.5
Certainty Versus Flexibility
This ﬂexibility is provided by equity which operates to mitigate potentially harsh
consequences of strict adherence to legal certainty. Gummow is of the view that
“equity has oiled the mechanisms that operate the statutory system. Indeed, without
recourse to equitable doctrines and remedies and their adaptation it is not easy to
see how the statutory system could be self-sufﬁcient.”174 The extent to which
interests off the register can be created and either put on the register or impeach
or postpone a registered interest will demonstrate the scope for equitable interven-
tion in the registration system.
The traditional view is that the register must be sufﬁciently ﬂexible to facilitate
alterations to mirror court orders creating or adjusting property rights or changes in
ownership brought about by events for example the bankruptcy of the land owner.
There is a threat to the register if it cannot accommodate these changes as informal
local transactions could spring up to counter its inﬂexibility.
One way of keeping the register ﬂexible but only to a degree is to introduce a
veto system which allows registration in the absence of an objection by the
registered owner. An example of this is the system of adverse possession in England
173 United Nations Economic and Social Council (2007), p. 5.
174 Gummow (2003), p. 66.

and Wales.175 Such rights would then only be registered after notice is served on the
registered owner. Deeney notes that over 40 years ago in Ireland forgery notices
were served on the registered owner prior to the registration of transfers or charges
but they were “discontinued as they had the effect of considerably slowing down
the registration process and causing unnecessary enquiries and cost.”176 Such
notices are an option in the current eDischarge process and he says consideration
should be given to the service of notices as a feature of eRegistration projects as
they are rolled out.177
If no new rights can be created there is a danger that the system will prove unable
to meet the demands and needs of land owners. There is then the possibility of
interests being created and traded off the register thus creating a separate market-
place. This devalues the register. However if too many new rights can be created
then land owners and lenders will hesitate to invest in property as there may be
unknown threats to their investment that cannot be determined. Land owners may
wish to create novel interests or push the boundaries of existing interests e.g. the
restrictive covenant, easement of storage178 but the register may not be ﬂexible
enough to accommodate those new interests. Generally registers tend to restrict
what new rights can be registered. The question arises as to the extent to which a
land owner can freely create new interests in his land and then expect those new
interests to be protected.
In Ontario under section 68(2) of the Land Titles Act a person having sufﬁcient
estate or interest in the land may create estates, interests and equities in the same
manner as the person might do if the land were not registered.
In Ireland further legal interests can be created by statute. Other estates and
interests take effect as equitable interests.179 The 2009 Act acknowledges judicial
recognition of equitable interests.180 Thus the courts remain free to exercise their
equitable jurisdiction to develop the law in order to accommodate the changing
needs of Irish society. Examples include the equitable doctrines of proprietary
estoppel and constructive and resulting trusts.181
Rajoy has explored the risks to legal certainty and the impact this has on
investment in the property market.182 He identiﬁes two risks. The ﬁrst is allowing
public administrations to decide who holds property rights and the potential abusive
or arbitrary use of this authority for political gain and the second is the opposite
extreme in allowing the traders in the market to assign, deﬁne and decide the order

of rights.183 He implies that there are only two markets, primary and secondary.184
This is a simplistic view as it could be said that there are in fact four markets.185
Firstly a primary market in buying and selling land. A secondary market in
non-acquisition, but involving secured lending on land. This market meets the
needs of these who want to unlock equity and who borrow to spend cash by using
their house as collateral. This may involve a secondary mortgage and during the
boom this type of lending became socially and economically viable with its focus
on wealth creation and consumption. As a result of this free availability of credit
many land owners now ﬁnd themselves overextended and in ﬁnancial difﬁculty. A
tertiary market may be a derivative of the ﬁrst and second and then fourthly a
complex commodities market involving the re-sale of mortgage books. This market
is reﬂected in the reﬁnancing and securitisation or repackaging of loan books and its
failure to deal adequately with risk is reﬂected in the subprime186 crises being
suffered by many jurisdictions.187
Thus there are many difﬁculties besetting private legal certainty in the property
market. How a jurisdiction deals with the competing demands of certainty and
ﬂexibility will have an impact on the market. Greater certainty will lead to a strong,
secure market but lack of ﬂexibility may restrict investment and lead to interests
being traded off the register. A great degree of ﬂexibility will allow changes to meet
the needs of owners but may also restrict investment as it would be difﬁcult to
establish the threats to ownership. Thus the extremes of both certainty and ﬂexi-
bility would be detrimental to the market and a balance must be achieved
between them.

A Stricter Numerus Clausus
Arrun˜ada identiﬁes the danger that contractual constraints188 may be imposed if a
stricter numerus clausus is necessary to make an automated system viable.189 In

printed forms and, no others, acts as a clog upon the dispositive powers of the
owner.190 He could in fact have been talking about the move to eConveyancing.
Constraints on contractual autonomy may be required for rationalisation of the
system. In addition to the speed versus legal-quality trade off, Arrun˜ada refers to the
“hidden dilemmas” relating to the standardisation of property rights.191 While there
is no doubt that there will be winners and losers in a move towards standardisation
and the reclassiﬁcation of property rights this trade off is not just about speed versus
legal-quality. There may be rights protected as a result of a social or political
environment which no longer exists. There may be fundamentally sound reasons
why such rights should no longer have the importance that they once had.
For example the Irish family home protection legislation192 was introduced at a
time when non-owning spouses could ﬁnd the family home sold out from under
them. This primarily disadvantaged women who were at home with the children
and had no independent means of support. The social protection imperative for this
legislation no longer exists and lending policy now dictates that the family home be
registered in joint names. Should this legislation now be revisited in light of the
changing nature of our society? Though the lending policy was implemented purely
to avoid lenders being caught by the spouses’ right and, if the protection is removed,
lending policy may revert thus exposing these parties to risk. These are the type of
policy issues that will need to be explored in any reclassiﬁcation of property rights.
If the register is all then the distinction between legal and equitable interests
would disappear. A contract for the sale of registered land would not confer an
equitable right.193 “Either a disposition is registered and takes full effect, or it is not
and has no effect at all. There is no intermediate position. . ..the centuries old
categorisation of legal and equitable interests in land will have no meaning.”194
The categorisation of interests into legal and equitable will, in eConveyancing, “be
devoid of any meaning, other than that given by the land registration legislation
itself.”195
Merrill and Smith do not see much distinction between the numerus clausus
explicit doctrine of the civil law world and the common law principle that property
rights must conﬁrm to certain standardised forms.196 They argue that what we want

Act 2002 at p. 574. He notes at p. 554 that legal and equitable interests have a life of their own
outside any registration system but under eConveyancing they may not. He notes also at p. 554 that
the traditional distinction and dividing line between ‘personal’ and ‘property’ interests will
change.

from a social point of view is optimal standardisation with the objective of
minimising the cost of measuring the attributes of the right, frustration costs and
administrative costs.197
By permitting a signiﬁcant number of different forms of property but forbidding courts to
recognize new ones, the numerus clausus strikes a balance between the proliferation of
property forms, on the one hand, and excessive rigidity on the other. . .. Permitting free
customization of new forms of property would impose signiﬁcant external costs on third
parties in the form of higher measurement costs. On the other hand, insisting on a “one size
ﬁts all” system of property rights would frustrate those legitimate objectives that can be
achieved only by using different property rights that fall short of full ownership. Optimal
standardization is the solution, and the numerus clausus moves the legal system closer to
the optimum, although we do not claim it generates a perfect mix of forms.198
Hansmann and Kraakman refer to Merrill and Smith’s optimal standardisation as
a “trade-off between the utility of having more forms and the confusion that more
forms would engender” and they disagree with this analysis.199 In their view the
restriction on the creation of property rights that deviate from the recognised forms
in each jurisdiction serve not to standardise rights but rather serve to aid veriﬁcation
of the ownership of rights offered for conveyance.200 Transferees need security as
to the interest they are purchasing otherwise they will spend time and resources on
investigations of title in an attempt to remove the insecurity and this will drive up
transaction costs.
The achievement of this optimal standardisation according to Merrill and Smith
is best done through legislative decision making201 rather than by the courts. The
rule change will be quicker and more informed than when it “must be teased out of
court opinions”,202 such changes will be universal in their application which
decreases the costs of ascertaining the rule and comprehending its meaning, the
change will be more stable and less likely to be transitory, legislation will be
prospective whereas judicial changes apply retroactively to the parties and legis-
lated change can devise the means for compensation whereas courts are endowed
with a limited set of options for devising remedies.203
For Van Erp the numerus clausus doctrine “if strictly applied, creates the risk
that innovation takes too much time, which might hamper the further development
of new categories of property rights that are being developed in legal practice.”204
He argues that ﬂexibility is required which enables property law to be more
responsive to economic developments in the law. However he also notes that

closing legal categories creates more legal security and reduces information
costs.205
There is no doubt that eConveyancing would work more easily with a numerus
clausus system. Standardisation, simpliﬁcation and certainty come more readily
when there is a ﬁxed list of property rights recognised as being capable of regis-
tration and when the law dictates that only those rights on the register bind the
world. This would cut down the enquiries that have to be carried out as no right
would exist off the register. Land owners would be required to actively protect their
rights by registration and could not rely on the law to protect them otherwise.
According to Lyall “[i]n a more secular age it may no longer be regarded as a moral
requirement to avoid taking advantage of the failure of others to protect their own
interests where they are able to do so.”206
For example in England and Wales under section 93 of the Land Registration
Act 2002 certain dispositions will only have effect if they are electronically
registered. Thus “failure to observe mandatory electronic formalities will not
even result in the creation of an equitable right, let alone one existing at law.”207
Non owning spouses or those in possession would not be protected without the
positive act of registration. The law would not intervene by default as a back up to
any failure to register. The matter would be clear cut; the register would be all.
Conclusion
eConveyancing with its increased emphasis on registration poses a threat to
the ongoing existence of the overriding interests that can be asserted. Legis-
lative reform will likely trigger an examination of all overriding interests and
their possible rationale. This could lead to such rights being devalued,
undermined or completely lost. Third parties such as U may be required to
bring their rights on to the register. At the moment there is no incentive for
those holding overriding interests to register them. This may change in an
eConveyancing environment.
Even in 1995 Fitzgerald advised that a revision of the formidable list of
overriding interests in Ireland might be timely.208 There is no doubt but that
some of the overriding interests in section 72 of the 1964 Act are relics of the

past.209 Examples include those relating to the Land Purchase Acts, Land
Commission and Labourers Act 1936.210 Similarly there may be no necessity
for those in occupation under a short term tenancy to be given the status of an
overriding interest as such tenancies are now required to be registered with
the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) under the Residential Ten-
ancies Act 2004.211 Given the reforms implemented by the 2009 Act it is also
questionable as to whether any customary rights arising from tenure still
exist212 and those overriding interests relating to fee farm grants will now
become obsolete as such interests can no longer be created.213
These particular overriding interests could likely be removed without
giving rise to injustice or practical difﬁculties. The position may be less
clear cut in respect of others, such as the rights of those in occupation or
covenants which continue in force after enlargement.214
While there may not be compelling social or economic reasons to remove
overriding interests entirely there is certainly merit in a reexamination of their
value
as
part
of
the
ongoing
reform
process.
The
move
toward
eConveyancing provides a landscape against which this reform can be
measured.
U will be at increased risk if the greater emphasis on registration means
that he has to register in order to protect his interest against a bona ﬁde
purchaser for value. Otherwise the interest will fall into the category of
interests that are destroyed by a transaction for value.
However there is a cost to enforced registration and because the cost is not
rolled into a transaction, it is highly visible and will be resented by U. If the
enforced registration costs ten million a year but B and C only save ﬁve
million in reduced legal and search fees then there is no overall cost saving.
Given that U is likely to be a non-commercial land user any imposition of
increased cost is likely to be resisted.
If eConveyancing leads to an increased emphasis on registration and
further standardisation of property rights then a registered transaction may
be given more impact, with an increase in its destructive effects. Additional

overreaching provisions may be introduced. Alternatively if the operation of
provisions, such as section 21 of the 2009 Act, are found to be overly complex
and detrimental in practice, then the legislature may move towards more clear
cut and deﬁnitive legislation along the lines of Ontario’s section 62(1). While
this does not destroy the trust there is the danger of the money being more
readily lost from the beneﬁciary’s reach.
Standardisation of rights puts the focus on policies which decide how
many interests and how those interests are to be protected from transactions
or dealings with the title. The legislature may require the courts to limit the
availability of equitable relief and this will lead to a reduction in successful
claims impacting on the ownership of land. The strengthening of the register
with its all encompassing remit will require parties to register to have any
entitlement. This will herald the reduction or even elimination of third party
interests held by U and successful property claims by V.
The power of the courts to recognise novel claims would be fettered. In the
choice between certainty and ﬂexibility, eConveyancing pushes towards a
stricter numerus clausus which facilitates ease of transaction, security of
registration and the commoditisation of ownership of land. Thus certain rights
may be reclassiﬁed into the category of rights that are not recognised and not
capable of registration.
Such major changes can have unintended consequences on risk. Chapter 9,
the concluding chapter, looks at the shift in risk and identiﬁes suggestions for
reform and research in the move towards eConveyancing. As Ireland is in the
early stages of its eConveyancing programme there remains the potential to
minimise any adverse consequences for participants in the land market while
maximising the beneﬁts of an electronic system.

Conclusion

Introduction
This analysis has examined the management of risk in conveyancing transactions in
the context of the move from paper based to electronic conveyancing. Legal,
descriptive, analytical and comparative techniques have been deployed in order to
determine the likely impact of technological change on the distribution of legal risk
with particular reference to Ontario and Ireland. The impact is the extent to which a
change in transactional process may unintentionally affect risk. Risk being the
consequence of change and the likelihood of that consequence having a negative
effect.
The particular focus has been on risks that impact on title registration and the
security, protection or lack thereof that this registration offers to land owners, third
parties and property claimants. The methodological approach to this investigation
of risk has been by use of a model of two conveyancing transactions.
This chapter is the concluding chapter. It provides an overarching view on the
impact of eConveyancing on risk and examines potential mechanisms for remov-
ing, minimising or distributing the risk or takes the view that the risk is worth
bearing given the other beneﬁts accrued. Finally it seeks to draw conclusions to
inform the reform process in Ireland.
9.2
Risk Versus Reward
In implementing technological change there is a change in the distribution of risk in
conveyancing transactions as the protection offered to different property rights is
strengthened or weakened. “Any major business process re-engineering of a long

established system such as conveyancing will raise the question for all participants
of costs and beneﬁts and changes to risk proﬁle.”1
If the risk cannot be removed, minimised or distributed is it worth bearing given
the other beneﬁts of eConveyancing? Even if the risk can be mitigated, is there
some factor, such as time, money or complexity that would make it undesirable?
Generally when risk is allocated it should not fall on those least able to bear the
consequences. This is a policy driven area where standards may be set, though this
often results in the risk being borne by banks and bureaucracies with the beneﬁt
falling on consumers. Compensation may not be a feasible option, as not all risks
are directly comparable when realised in monetary terms.
eConveyancing has the potential to deliver numerous beneﬁts. There may be a
reduction in the cost of title registration and greater accuracy of the register with the
priority of interests more readily apparent and more transparent. There will be
increased access to live register data and the possibility for quicker completion and
registration. The protection of registration will be granted at an earlier stage, closer
to completion, and if the register is all encompassing then there will be less
searching required which will lead to lower costs.
Legal rules should minimise and balance the risks between present and would-be
owners but Baird and Jackson point out that rules which increase the information
about property ownership, presumably reducing the risks, bring their own costs and
these must be weighted against the beneﬁts.2 Improvements in transparency how-
ever beneﬁt all participants.
Transaction time may be reduced. Electronic messaging will be virtually instan-
taneous versus postal delivery which takes at least a day. If lawyers are able to
deliver information and documentation more readily to each other, then they will be
able to respond in a more timely manner and while the details of the transaction are
fresh. Less administration will be required as documentation can be pre-populated;
it will be sufﬁcient to type data in once. This data will then be validated by the
registering authority so that any difﬁculties can be addressed before completion.
The improved efﬁciencies and improved collaboration between stakeholders will
beneﬁt all participants in the process.
There is no merit in governments, registries or citizens attempting to halt the
march of technology. That argument has already been lost and technology is now an
integral part of daily life. Instead it is preferable to make technological advances
work to the advantage of processes that require improvement.
There is no doubt that the move towards electronic conveyancing will continue unabated.
The information technology experts have an unshakeable grip on the psyche of society and
the need to reduce the human element in transactions. In conveyancing terms, this offers a
promise of greater accuracy, more certainty of title, and provided the security concerns of
access to central databases can be overcome, the opportunity for reduced claims on the
assurance fund.3

Conclusion

The achievement of the savings and efﬁciencies from eConveyancing will, if
realised, accrue to all land owners however this comes with increased risk for some
participants.
While this analysis focused on the management of risk in relation to land
owners, third parties and property claimants it must not be forgotten that
eConveyancing offers considerable beneﬁts to the state through its title register.
There may also be beneﬁts to professionals involved in the conveyancing process.
Those beneﬁts may however come at the cost of increased risk for those pro-
fessionals and this would merit further study.
9.3
Impact of eConveyancing on Risk
eConveyancing will move risk from one participant to another by the substantive
and procedural rules it imposes. Conveyancing itself is a risk distribution system
and this does not change in an eConveyancing environment. As Keating notes
“[c]onveyancing is a process which requires an ability to recognise and minimise
risks; the risk that the vendor is acting fraudulently or the risk that another party
such as a lender may have a greater form of interest or estate in the property.”4
Chapter 5 set out a model in order to provide a transaction unit analysis. This
involved the creation of two abstracted conveyancing transactions; an arms length
transaction for value and a gift. This schematic allowed risk to be allocated to the
abstract participants in order to determine how each risk is impacted by the move to
eConveyancing. Some conclusions can now be drawn from the analysis of each risk
category.
9.3.1
Registration Gap
The elimination or compression of the registration gap does have an impact on risk
in conveyancing transactions. It lowers risk for B, Y and C. There is less delay in
achieving the protection of registration and reduced possibility for an intervening
interest to be registered.
While the risk to B, Y and C is reduced there is increased risk for U and V. They
have less time to register their right or claim before it may be destroyed by a
registered transaction.
Y will still be subject to all unregistered rights to which X held the land unless
his status is improved. There are law reform proposals in other jurisdictions
suggesting this but it has not been proposed in Ireland and would be unlikely to
be adopted. From the perspective of a complete register it would make sense to treat
4 Keating (2012), p. 7.

291

Y the same as B. However, X would then be able to use the gift of Whiteacre to Y to
destroy valuable unregistered interests and there would be no direct market interest
to counter balance. Also there is no market claim for Y and there are many instances
where X has attempted to use a gift to Y to circumvent his creditors so treating Y
and B the same is not recommended.
Given that the registering authority is to remain the gatekeeper of the title
register it is unlikely that the registration gap in Ireland can be eliminated entirely
but there is merit in reducing it as much as possible. There is discussion in Ireland
about bringing priority entries5 into the next phase of eRegistration which may
reduce some of the current risk between completion and registration but this has a
cost associated with it. Also if a priority entry becomes standard practice, does it
remove the incentive to reduce the registration gap? It would be preferable to
reduce or eliminate the registration gap in so far as this is feasible while not
implementing an automatic system. As a small gap will remain a priority entry
could be used to seal this gap.6
The reduced risk to B, Y and C afﬁrms the value of title registration as a feature
of the Irish land administration system and enhances the security of the market. This
provides increased protection to land owners at the expense of U and V.
9.3.2
Formalities for Registration
Initial indications are that electronic systems with more streamlined formalities
result in less errors in applications for registration. In built system prompts provide
the opportunity for problems to be corrected in advance of completion. If there are
less registry errors all parties who participate in the registration system will beneﬁt
from the increased accuracy. The registering authority will also beneﬁt from a
reduction in claims.
This will decrease the risk for all participants as applications for registration are
less likely to be rejected. It will also facilitate closing of the registration gap. The
beneﬁts of standardisation and simpliﬁcation must, however, be balanced against
any contractual constraints that might result. If eConveyancing prevents new
interests in land, that currently cannot even be conceived, then this will fetter
land owners, make the market less responsive to changes in society and limit new
U interests and V claims.
5 This would provide a mechanism for a priority period to bridge the registration gap. See Sect. 6.2.
6 According to Deeney it is arguable that such an entry ought to be the norm as such a registration
“effectively safeguards” the position of an intending purchaser or chargee against transactions for
value that might defeat them. See Deeney (2014), p. 377.

Conclusion

9.3.3
Error in Register
It is difﬁcult to establish if eConveyancing of itself will lead to increased fraud.
There is no evidence that more fraud occurs in an electronic environment7 though
this is one of the reasons most often cited for caution in implementing
eConveyancing. An increase in property fraud may be attributable to the increasing
globalisation of our society, new methods of squeezing cash from land ownership
and property booms and busts rather than being in any way directly attributable to
electronic systems. The disassociation of dealing with a virtual environment may be
in part to blame but there is a strong argument that it is linked to predatory lending
practices as much of the case law on fraud relates to mortgage fraud and particularly
identity theft perpetrated on lenders.8 This is one reason why many jurisdictions
including Ontario have moved to introduce more stringent controls on lending
practices with speciﬁc provisions around the necessity for due diligence.
The analysis of the system in Ontario provides grounds for determining how the
Irish courts might deal with similar challenges and provides a framework for writers
and academics to explore how the nature of indefeasibility might develop in
Ireland. This research opens this debate in advance of any consideration by the
courts. The low levels of fraud claims against the LTAF in Ontario may be due to
the nature of the claim system and the proﬁleration of title insurance rather than
proof that electronic systems can be robust enough to withstand fraud. This aspect
requires further research.
Who bears the risk under this heading will be determined by whether the Irish
courts ﬁnd the register defeasible or indefeasible and if it is the latter whether this is
immediate or deferred. In the absence of a subsequent transaction the law allows the
court to rectify in favour of A but it by no means certain that this would occur if B is
in occupation.
A policy of immediate indefeasibility would beneﬁt B and C at the expense of A
who would only be entitled to compensation. Y is however likely to lose out to a
claim of prior ownership by X. If there is a subsequent transaction a policy of
deferred indefeasibility would beneﬁt D and C2 at the expense of A, who again
would only be entitled to compensation. This is presuming that the courts will not
distinguish between the title of B and C or that of D and C2. As one is a purchaser
and the other a lender the courts may choose to give them differing levels of
protection rather than bundling their interests together.
In relation to errors there is the potential to reduce these through the system
design. eConveyancing may not, of itself, create more errors and increased loss but
may reveal errors and losses already in the conveyancing system. Those errors and
7 HM Land Registry does not accept any link between eConveyancing and fraud noting that the
rise in fraud in England has occurred during a period when apart from a small number of electronic
charges it was not possible to use or submit electronic documents for registration.
8 See Tufﬁn (2009), pp. 280–310 and O’Connor (2009), pp. 133–159. Both explore risk arising
from bad lending practices and particularly the lack of due diligence by lenders.

losses may previously have been hidden from the general public and policy makers
and illumination provides the opportunity for them to be acknowledged and
addressed. Thus the system can be designed to close off some current risks in the
process. This would beneﬁt all parties who rely on registration and also beneﬁt the
registering authority through reduced claims.
9.3.4
Interests Off the Register Which Affect Title
eConveyancing with its increased emphasis on the title register leads to an exam-
ination of which interests should be protected by the register and which should not.
Overriding interests as a category of property rights require a review and, if this
category is to be retained, the individual interests should be examined to determine
whether reform is required. Some of these interests are out of date and may no
longer have the same relevance. The efﬁciency resulting from the removal of this
category of rights needs to be balanced against any injustice that might be caused to
those holding such rights.
The general rationale for this category of rights is that they keep the register
ﬂexible and applicable but many of the individual rights, when examined closely,
do not fulﬁll these criteria. If these rights are reduced or removed as a category this
will increase risk for U and V. This may not immediately correspond to any
decreased risk or lower costs for other participants but will impact future trans-
actions when B and C don’t have to enquire about such rights.
9.3.5
Destructive Effects of a Registered Transaction
With the increased emphasis on the register the power of a registered transaction is
likely to increase. This will have a negative impact on the interests of U and
V. Their interests may become rights that have no impact on the ownership of
land. An assessment would need to be carried out to determine if there is some other
means of providing sufﬁcient protection for those holding such rights or are there
some interests which should survive a registered transaction.
A claim that was previously a property claim may become a personal claim. This
would change the nature of some claims fundamentally but will have less impact on
others. For example, could the claim to an easement or reliance on a restrictive
covenant exist without some link to the title? In relation to trusts and equitable
charges the claim will continue to exist provided there are funds to meet the claim.
Other rights are temporary such as an option to purchase but if they are not
recognised then there is no market as they cannot be bought and sold. This may
close off areas of the land market that currently exist.
294

Conclusion

9.3.6
Rights Not Recognised
The re-classiﬁcation of interests in land has already commenced and is likely to be
driven further by the demands of standardisation and simpliﬁcation to make an
electronic system viable. The impact of any re-classiﬁcation of rights needs to be
carefully assessed and should form part of an overall reform strategy.
Such a re-classiﬁcation may put the right of certain participants at risk. In
particular the interests of U and V may be open to scrutiny. Third party rights are
most at risk of being downgraded to personal rights or rights which can be defeated
by a registered transaction. If it is the latter and the registration gap is eliminated or
compressed then there is little possibility of such rights intervening between the
registered interests of A and B. If overriding interests are also downgraded to rights
which can be overridden by a registered transaction then U and V will have few, if
any, opportunity for enforcing their right or claim against the land.
9.4
Risk to U and V
Thus the parties who are most at risk in any move towards eConveyancing will be U
and V. There is the potential for all other parties to beneﬁt from efﬁciencies in the
system of title registration. This is indicative of the fact that all other parties are
already participants whose interests are embedded in the title register. As a general
rule all the other participants (A, B, C, X and Y) will seek to have their interest
protected by the registration system. Whereas U and V may seek to rely not on the
register but on some other factor such as:
(a)
the status of their interest as an overriding interest;
(b)
a personal claim against the grantor of the interest;
(c)
some personal relationship with the registered owner; or
(d)
occupation of the property.
The registered owner may accept that the right or claim held by U and V has
merit as often the facts speak for themselves. U is in occupation. V is married to
A. U did contribute to the purchase monies or X did give V an option to purchase
the land. A conﬂict between U and V and the other participants in the land market
may not be about the existence of the claim or right but instead be a conﬂict about
the breadth and depth of the claim.
The existence of such a claim or right may not, in reality, have any impact on the
title register but in seeking to ensure priority of registration B and C are required to
carry out enquiries about potential claims or rights held by U and V. This adds to the
cost of conveyancing and undermines the effectiveness of the title register.
When examining the key objective of each participant as set out in Chap. 5 it
appears that eConveyancing may defeat the resilience sought by U the third party
9.4
Risk to U and V

and V the property claimant. The extent to which this occurs will depend on how U
and V are to be dealt with and there are a number of options.
U rights and V claims may be reduced or downgraded to personal rights or rights
which can be defeated by a registered transaction. This would make the system
cleaner and easier, reduce risk and cost for B and C but adversely affect U and V.
Alternatively U and V could be brought onto the register. This imposes cost on U
and V. If these rights or claims would previously have been personal rights or
defeated by a registered transaction, then bringing them onto the register will have a
detrimental effect on the interest of land owners. If however they were overriding
interests that affected without registration then it would beneﬁt future land owners
to have these reﬂected on the register.
Another option is to provide compensation for U and V if their interest or claim
is downgraded or defeated or compensation for purchasers if U and V cannot be
disposed of or brought onto the register.
Requiring U or V to register or downgrading their interest or claim would be an
interference in the land market and this should be considered carefully. There is a
general acceptance of De Soto’s argument that a secure and efﬁcient land market
creates more credit and investment and thus generates economic growth.9 If we
accept this argument we interfere with the market at our peril.
9.5
Interference in the Land Market
Property rights are maintained and enforced through governmental support via
legislation and the operation of state agencies such as the registering authority
and all land ownership will incur some form of regulation.10 However the practical
and economic implications must also be considered when major changes are being
introduced, particularly if this is done within a short period of time.
Rapaczynski notes that every jurisdiction engages in regulation that impairs or
encroaches on the value of people’s investments and most are not considered
“compensable takings” however the political system and economic pressure groups
will ensure the state does not go “too far” in interfering with an owners control over
his assets.11 This may be true of lenders or investors but is less true of consumers.
They are a dispersed group with diverse interests and have less organised repre-
sentation. Often it is the state that ﬁnances and controls the consumer lobby.
Thus a conﬂict may arise. On the one hand consumers are seen as being more
vulnerable than other participants in the land market and often merit increased
protection which manifests itself in consumer protection legislation. On the other
9 De Soto (2001).
10 Gray and Gray note that title “as self-authenticating social reality has given way to title as state-
regulated bureaucratic fact.” See Gray and Gray (2009), p. 180.

Conclusion

hand consumers do not have the same level of representation at policy level and this
may make it easier for a government to subvert the interests of the consumer to
economic or public policy considerations. The legislation may go too far in one
direction or the other and as a result may not achieve either objective.
Any enhanced reliance on registration of title will need to factor in the mainte-
nance of security of title so that the market can operate efﬁciently and effectively.
Sneddon notes the importance of ensuring continued conﬁdence in the marketplace
for conveyancing.12 “If the right land administration system is deﬁned, it will show
‘emergent properties’, in this case ‘trustworthiness’; the fact that people can and
will rely on and contribute to the system.”13 The Irish registering authority currently
has this trustworthiness and maintaining it is vital.14 As Deeney notes “[i]t is
essential that the system of registration of title maintains the conﬁdence of the
Court, the legal profession and the general public.”15
According to Ruoff the Torrens system has ﬁve objects, namely, reliability,
simplicity, cheapness, expedition and suitability.16 This is equally true of all title
registration systems and eConveyancing will only succeed if it moves land regis-
tration closer to these fundamental objectives. The challenge is that these objectives
may not be totally congruous and the move towards eConveyancing may reveal
tensions between them. One object may need to take precedence over another. For
example if the register is to be completely reliable all interests should be registered,
including those held by U, but this will impose cost on those holding overriding
interests, for example, who are now required to register.
Such interference in the land market may be more acceptable where the
increased risk can be mitigated. The question arises as to whether this is possible.
Third parties and property claimants like U and V could be given a period of time to
register their right and thereafter it would be lost. If U or V were successful in
registering, then their interest is protected as a property right and if their claim is
unsuccessful and fails then the interest is destroyed. After a period of time no new
interests or claims of that nature would be allowed.
As Holmes points out in referring to statutes of limitation and the law of
prescription “what is the justiﬁcation for depriving a man of his rights, a pure evil
as far as it goes, in consequence of the lapse of time?” but he also notes that “[s]
ometimes it is said that, if a man neglects to enforce his rights, he cannot complain
if, after a while, the law follows his example.”17 This may be a useful argument
when depriving an individual of rights that he has failed to protect but has less merit
when used to justify the removal or downgrading of an entire category of rights.

9.5
Interference in the Land Market
297

To extend a prohibition to all new interests or claims would be a drastic move by
the legislature which throws up public policy and justice issues. This may, in effect,
mean a deﬁnitive move towards the civil law numerous clausus, the removal of the
Courts and land owners discretion to create new interests in land thus introducing a
lack of ﬂexibility into the common law system that would overturn centuries of
tradition.
The gains would be certainty, the register becoming all encompassing and the
state having a more direct role in the nature and existence of title. Estates, rights and
interests whether legal or beneﬁcial would be of no relevance as the registered legal
title would be all. This may have been the original aim of the Torrens registered title
system but the reality of such a system would send shock waves through the
common law world.
Despite this clear moves are already afoot in various jurisdictions with the
limiting or removal of adverse possession claims, reduction in overriding interests,
trusts being moved off the register and the attempt to move easements onto the
register. Dematerialism also throws any interest dependent on the holding of paper
evidence of the interest into doubt.18
None of the risks to the parties holding those interests have been mitigated by a
general compensation scheme19 or through insurance but interference in the land
market can be softened by indemnifying parties adversely affected by change. Thus
it is important to consider the merits of this as a risk avoidance mechanism.
Title registration systems use a combination of risk management strategies to
reduce the incidence of conﬂicts between different interests. O’Connor refers to the
generation of publicity for interests to reduce the likelihood of conﬂict, establish-
ment of new priority rules that provide an incentive to register, the transfer of some
risks to the State and the spreading of risk through an indemnity scheme.20
Thus mitigation of risk can be done by existing insurance or compensation or
new provisions may be required. However new insurance must be paid for and
additional claims on existing insurance will be paid for by increased premiums.
Additional claims on the registering authority compensation fund will come from
central exchequer and will likely be passed on to land owners through higher
registration fees. The question arises as to whether the state should bear the loss
or is there a role for private insurance?

Conclusion

Indemnity for Loss
9.6.1
Title Insurance Versus State Compensation
Title insurance is a form of insurance that generally protects a land owner’s title
against loss incurred as a result of unknown or undetected title defects for as long as
the land owner owns the title. Depending on the nature of the policy it can protect
against fraud, errors in title registration and overriding interests. It is “an after-the-
fact indemnity.”21 Thus an actual loss must occur.
Title insurance is insurance purchased privately by the land owner and may add
an additional cost to the transaction though this may be offset by other costs which
are removed from the process. For example, if B is relying on title insurance his
lawyer may see no need to carry out the same level of detailed enquiries about
encumbrances.
The question arises as to whether the use of title insurance encourages title
defects to be hidden. In a system where title insurance is standard it provides no
encouragement for title defects to be remedied before a conveyancing transaction is
concluded. Comprehensive searches may not be done to identify potential difﬁcul-
ties with the title that would properly inform the transferee B or acquisition lender
C. This may reduce the cost of the transaction but is it worth it? As Moore and
Globe point out
[s]imple reliance on title insurance as protection against ﬁnancial loss and a narrowed focus
on the bottom line can interfere with a purchaser’s awareness of the personal and ﬁnancial
values of being fully informed on all matters relating to land ownership and enjoyment.22
Is ﬁnancial compensation likely to be adequate compensation for loss of title,
possession or enjoyment of the property? In the case of a family home this is
unlikely to be the case.
Manthorpe is of the view that the title insurance system
seems to be an inferior system offering less protection and at greater expense than the land
registration systems in other countries. . ..Although it provides ﬁnancial recompense if title
is later to be found to be invalid this is usually only to the value of the purchase price at the
time the property was bought. It does not protect the owner’s possession of a property
bought in good faith.23
Not every commentator is as critical. Bucknall is of the view that in Ontario title
insurance provides a useful and economic supplement to conventional conveyanc-
ing practices.24 He asks if “title insurance [should] be put in place as a private
protection against losses created by the statutory registration scheme? Should

landowners expect to protect themselves when statutory protection is obviously
inadequate?”25
Donahue et al. listed the beneﬁts as including less searching, avoiding surveys,
insuring existing defects, providing broad coverage and the covering of post-
closing events.26 However one could be forgiven for being skeptical about these
claims. Surely if all of these beneﬁts could be realised the entire world would have
adopted title insurance?
There are some searches or enquiries that cannot, or it is argued, should not, be
covered by title insurance. For example O’Hara and Husa note that “title insurance
is not a substitute for a survey prepared by a professional land surveyor.”27 This was
made abundantly clear by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario v. Syvan
Developments Ltd.28 When the title to the property was converted from the
unregistered to the registered system a right of way was inadvertently included
and the error was not discovered until after the transaction closed. It was argued that
a prudent developer in the plaintiff’s position would have obtained an up to date
survey prior to completion and this would have disclosed that the right of way no
longer existed and the court agreed.
Thus
an act or omission that would otherwise be a neglect or default within the meaning of the
provision [i.e. s 59(1)(c)] will not cease to be so if is [sic] has been insured against. In other
words, a defect is a defect is a defect. While title insurance may indemnify a party from
defects in title, it does nothing to guarantee title or cure defects. . .Title insurance is not a
substitute for due diligence.29
The lawyer is still required to properly advise their client and to disclose material
information that would affect the client’s decision to enter into the transaction.30
Also title insurance only protects a transferee and may be provided only for a
certain period of time. It is not “a one-size-ﬁts-all policy that eliminates the need for
searches or surveys”.31
In Bertrand v. Trites32 the court denied a claim for compensation partly on the
grounds that the purchasers choose to obtain title insurance but not a land survey
prior to closing. “[T]he Plaintiffs elected to take title insurance rather than obtaining
a survey to inform themselves. . .. By doing so, they undertook the risk, and
sequentially the cost, if necessary, of relocating the barn and garage or obtaining
a minor variance” as their location infringed local set back provisions.

Conclusion

Title insurance can cover a wide range of risks including errors or defects in the
title, imperfect legal services, reimbursement for legal fees and expenses and losses
caused by fraud or forgery.33 However MacInnes and Pinnington warn that title
insurance will not protect if there has been a “valid fraud” i.e. the lender will be
protected if the charge is fraudulent and invalid but not if the ﬁnancing is greater
than justiﬁed by the true value of the property.34
Title insurance is the business of accepting risk in return for payment of a
premium. A title insurance company that does not collect more premiums than
claims paid will quickly go into liquidation. Thus there may be strict requirements
to be met before compensation is paid. It is not a failsafe last resort as contributory
negligence will be taken into account and the policy will provide for subrogation.
Thus title insurance will not protect in every instance. Each policy will have
differences in relation to covered risks, due diligence requirements, exclusions
and time periods. Title insurance
provides owners and lenders with comprehensive no-fault protection against both title and
legal services risks inherent in real estate transactions. . .[however like all forms of insur-
ance] coverage is subject to numerous detailed exclusions, exemptions and endorsements.35
The view could also be taken that the risks protected by title insurance rarely
occur and thus it is of no value however its merits must be compared as against
other methods of closing off the same risk.36
State compensation similarly does not cover everything. There are exceptions in
the legislation, overriding interests, in personam claims, interests incapable of
registration and also dangers faced by volunteers who have less protection. State
compensation will generally only arise if the state is responsible for the loss or the
operation of the system overrides someone’s interest; it is not a blanket insurance
against risk but neither is title insurance.37 In personam claims are not likely to be
covered
by
title
insurance
and
certainly
not
claims
arising
from
post
completion acts.
It could be argued that title insurance is used by lawyers purely as a means of
diminishing their own exposure to negligence38 however Irish lawyers have chosen
not to use title insurance in this manner and in Ontario title insurance has not
resulted in less claims by clients against their lawyers.39

New Zealand. See Flaws (2003), pp. 407–413. It should be remembered however that this system
provides for automatic registration. See p. 414.
38 Reevy notes that by getting the client to use title insurance the risk to the practitioner of a
subsequent negligence action is diminished. See Reevy (2003), p. 902. However Rolph is of the
view that title insurance is not the panacea solicitors in Ontario had hoped for. See Rolph (2010).

Indemnity for Loss
301

Moore and Globe noted in 2003 that
real estate transactions, and more particularly title, execution and adjoining lands searches,
give rise to a disproportionate number of negligence claims against lawyers. Traditionally,
real estate claims have accounted for almost one half of all claims made annually against
LawPRO, the Lawyers Professional Indemnity Company.40
This statement is not supported by the ﬁgures produced by LawPRO but
conveyancing malpractice claims are the second highest after civil litigation and
these claims account for a higher percentage of claims costs.41 Over the 10 years
prior to 2010 the claims averaged 29 % of claims and 30 % of claims costs.42
The penetration of title insurance in the Ontario conveyancing market has an
impact on risk however it is worth noting that title insurance is not a standard
feature of conveyancing in Ireland. In Ireland it may be used where there is a
particular defect on title that cannot be remedied until some time has passed. It was
previously used by sub-prime lenders for re-mortgages during the property boom
however most of these lenders are no longer lending and only retain a presence in
Ireland for enforcement purposes.
The experience in other jurisdictions shows that there are dangers in the wide-
spread adoption of title insurance as a means of mitigating risk in conveyancing. If
title insurance is introduced:
[t]he insurers’ strategy of risk assumption could result in increased claims upon the. . .
indemnity fund, by reducing standards of due diligence in conveyancing. If changed
conveyancing practices induced by title insurance adversely impact upon the fund, it is
likely that governments will propose measures to shift the risks back to the insurers.
Legislatures will bar title insurers from exercising the subrogated rights of the insured to
claim. . .and exclude claims on the fund by privately insured persons for losses covered by
their policies.43
O’Connor provides examples of jurisdictions where the state indemnity pro-
visions have been limited effectively shifting risk to claimants and their represen-
tatives particularly where there has been fraud or negligence.44
If private title insurance is used to mitigate risk there is a danger that this will
result in the statutory scheme operated by the registry being downgraded. This will
result in further increased emphasis on private title insurance with a corresponding
decrease in claims against the indemnity fund. A continual shift has the potential to
eliminate the indemnity fund entirely with only title insurance remaining. This
private title insurance will be optional and thus some participants may choose not to
pay and assume the risk instead. This shift in risk assumption from the state to
individuals can be seen in Ontario.

Conclusion

Title insurance prevails and dominates the conveyancing system in both the
United States45 and Ontario.46 In Ontario the consideration of title insurance is now
a required step in both purchase and lending transactions.47 Waters estimated in
2010 that 95 % of residential purchase transactions in Ontario were title insured.48
This may account in part for the low level of claims against the LTAF as set out in
Chap. 7 but it is also an indication of lack of public conﬁdence in the system of title
investigation and transfer. In a system where title insurance is standard it provides
no encouragement for the defects to be remedied before a conveyancing transaction
is concluded.
The proﬁleration of title insurance in the market has led to this area being
regulated by legislation and also by rules of professional conduct laid down by
the Law Society of Upper Canada.49 Indeed the rules themselves may have con-
tributed to the penetration as rule 2.02 of the Rules of Professional Conduct relates
speciﬁcally to title insurance in real estate transactions.50
The LTAF and title insurance co-exist but the LTAF will not pay out if the claim
is covered by title insurance. Thus the state indemnity has been diluted with the
penetration of title insurance in the market. Though as a matter of public policy and
equity, surely the state indemnity fund should pay out if the loss is due to inbuilt risk
in the system regardless of fault and regardless of whether the claimant has another
recourse. The state should not be encouraged to avoid liability for its errors and
place the onus on individual land owners.
Title insurance as a method of socialising risk puts the onus on individuals rather
than on the state. If a land owner chooses not to take out title insurance he may have
recourse to the LTAF for some losses and he avoids the cost of title insurance. He
must pay for registration but this is a cost that has to be incurred independent of any
potential claim. Alternatively if he chooses to take out title insurance, he may have
recourse to the title insurer for losses not covered by the LTAF, but he paid for this
via a premium. Of course some losses may not be covered at all.
Flaws suggests that private insurance and state compensation are complemen-
tary and that such insurance is not a threat to the quality of conveyancing.51
Rather, it can be used as a commercial tool to cover the gaps created by many of the
limitations and exceptions of state compensation and to provide economic protection
against a broad range of property law risks that the state has no business or interest in
covering.52

9.6
Indemnity for Loss
303

However in a choice between state compensation and title insurance, state
compensation is to be preferred for many reasons. The social insurance model
operated via the state compensation fund facilitates distribution of risk by
maximising the pool of insured persons and allows for cross-subsidisation.
O’Connor describes this as “[t]he right to indemnity is not conﬁned to contributors.
Persons who have had no dealings with the registry may suffer loss through a
registry error or omission”.53 By contrast only those who take out title insurance
will be able to claim against the policy.
While acknowledging that private title insurance may be able to transfer to an
insurer certain risks
[t]he worst scenario would see governments abandoning universal social insurance in
favour of optional private insurance, many people opting to go without cover and the
occasional person suffering disastrous loss without recourse to compensation.54
The experience in Ontario and other jurisdictions shows that the penetration of
title insurance allows the government to narrow its liability and this is to be
avoided. While there might be some argument for a reduction in the state liability
where an automatic eConveyancing system is being implemented, and the regis-
tering authority is no longer responsible for changes to the title register, there is no
such argument in the implementation of an automated (but not automatic)
eConveyancing system.
Regardless of whether compensation is provided via title insurance or state
compensation it is not a perfect remedy. A land owner will likely not consider
money to be adequate compensation for loss of title, possession or enjoyment of the
property particularly in the case of a family home. As Ziff points out title insurance
is not a guarantee of title but rather a source of indemnity55 and coverage can be
limited in several ways.56
Similarly monetary compensation may not be adequate for U and V if their right
or claim cannot exist independently of the land. The real merit of the state
compensation lies in its complimentary interaction with the rectiﬁcation provisions.
Any attempt to decouple these and insert title insurance between them is surely
likely to allow certain claims to fall through the cracks.
If the increased risk to U and V is to be mitigated by private insurance or the
general compensation scheme then loss allocation rules may provide assistance in
examining which, if any, mechanism should be used to compensate U and V.

Imposition of Loss
These
have

been
considered
by
Sneddon
in
the
context
of
eConveyancing.57 In
looking
at
maintaining
conﬁdence
in
the
move
to
eConveyancing in Australia, he set out three principles, from the economic efﬁ-
ciency approach to liability and loss allocation rules, as follows:
1. liability should be allocated to the party or parties that can reduce the incidence
of losses at the lowest cost (‘least cost avoider’)58;
2. liability should be allocated to the party or parties best able to spread the losses
(liability for substantial losses may be spread over a wide class by insurance or a
claim fund to which all members of the class contribute)59; and
3. liability allocation rules should be simple, clear and decisive so as to minimise
the costs of administering them and disputes about their application.60
He refers to Cooter and Rubin who explain rules of loss imposition, loss
spreading, and loss reduction.61 Cooter and Rubin note that most people are risk
averse and when facing a possible loss will pay out more than the loss’s average
value to eliminate the risk and the widespread use of insurance is evidence of this.62
Griggs and Low note that the principle of loss imposition asks who should
enforce or have the loss imposed on them and the clearest solution is to let the
loss lie where it occurs but this fails to take into consideration that the consumer is
less likely to be able to enforce their rights.63
Loss reduction would mean identifying the least cost avoider and this would be
B and C.64 The party who can guard against the loss most easily should incur the
cost. This would in effect maintain the current position but provide compensation to
57 Sneddon (2007).
58 This ‘cheapest cost avoider’ principle introduced by Guido Calabresi is widely used in the
interdisciplinary ﬁeld of law and economics. See Calabresi (1970). See also Coleman (2005),
pp. 337–354; and Posner (2005), pp. 12–23.
59 Griggs and Low (2011), pp. 285–308 are of the view that the guiding economics behind loss
allocation and loss spreading is that the risk should be borne by the person who can achieve risk
neutrality at the lowest level i.e. a ﬁnancial institution or insurer. See p. 289.
60 Sneddon (2007), p. 10.
61 Cooter and Rubin (1987–1988), p. 70. Griggs and Low refer to this as the seminal article on loss
spreading, loss reduction and loss imposition. See Griggs and Low (2011), pp. 285–308.
62 Cooter and Rubin (1987–1988), pp. 70–71.
63 Griggs and Low (2011), p. 290.
64 O’Connor notes that the Ontario Court of Appeal invoked the cheaper cost avoider analysis in
support of deferred indefeasibility thus placing the burden of the fraud on the lender rather than the
innocent homeowner. See O’Connor (2009), p. 141. She notes at p. 134 that very few jurisdictions
extend immediate indefeasibility to mortgagees and argues that there are sound policy reasons for
denying immediate indefeasibility to mortgagees even if the rule is adopted for transferees. As
between the mortgagee and land owner the mortgagee can at the least cost avoid identity fraud by
adjusting their behaviour in the transaction. The courts in British Columbia adopt a similar
approach; see Keating (2012), pp. 94–96. In British Columbia unless a mortgage is granted by

B and perhaps C if U and V cannot be disposed of or brought onto the register. Such
compensation would likely be subject to due diligence putting the onus on B and C
to enquire about U and V. This due diligence or notice requirement would maintain
the status quo as it applies to overriding interests except that compensation would
be payable in the event that U and V were undiscoverable as this would be a
systematic risk. This makes sense as B and C should not be at risk due to
undiscoverable U interests and V claims. This option however retains the cost of
off register enquiries and searches and mitigates against a complete all
encompassing register. In the current recessionary climate any suggestion that the
state compensation scheme be extended is likely to be rejected. In addition the
option of compensation for B and C provides less incentive for U or V to make and
register their interest or claim.
In referring to the lowest cost avoider Griggs and Low note that in Australia
there are obligations imposed on mortgagees to verify identity yet little is imposed
on the owners of real estate.65 They question what it is reasonable to expect of
owners of land noting that if responsibility and liability is solely imposed on
ﬁnancial institutions then there is little incentive for homeowners to take precau-
tions and requiring them to
take precautions will only be of use if the behaviour of those people alters. If it does not,
imposing liability makes little sense. For this reason, whereas loss spreading clearly
favoured the imposition of liability on the bank in a land transaction, the result is not as
clear for loss reduction.66
Loss spreading could also mean to either impose such loss on the state, paid for
by all citizens, or on all those who avail of the protection of title registration through
increased fees.
A scheme to compensate U or V for any loss, however it occurred, would be
difﬁcult to justify. Compensation for losses caused to U and V by the registration
system is more justiﬁable when there is a gain for other users of the system, in
disregarding the interests of U and V, particularly when there is an overall public
beneﬁt. Such a scheme would avoid human rights issues by giving compensation
for the de facto expropriation of the property interest.
The downgrading or destruction of U’s interest may bring a net public gain and
thus it seems fair to compensate U, however V is more problematic as the nature of
the interest may be subject to dispute. Any compensation scheme would have to
resolve the validity of the claim before its value could be assessed.
The existing, or a new compensation fund, could be utilised with payment of
compensation dependent on the taking of reasonable action by U and V. For
example U or V may be required to bring their interest or claim to the notice of
land owners, or those engaged in a transaction, or, U and V may be required to make
the true owner of a property the mortgage is invalid and the owner’s title will be returned to its
original state. See BC OnLine.

Conclusion

their claim within a set time scale to avoid the difﬁculty of unquantiﬁable liabilities
to the system. A claimant with sufﬁcient claim against the land owner may not be
eligible so as to avoid the potential for land owners to be relieved of obligations
they had undertaken. Instead the land owner could be required to compensate U and
V directly.
U and V could be given an opportunity to assert their right so as to reduce the
incidence of losses and if a new simple, efﬁcient and cost effective scheme was put
in place this would fulﬁl the loss reduction rule. Currently if there is a dispute
between a land owner and third party or property claimant this can only be resolved
by a court case which is expensive and lengthy. A new scheme would beneﬁt U and
V if the rules were simple, clear and precise.
Alternatively private insurance could be offered but this would be an imperfect
solution as it would likely not cover all claims or claimants. In addition, as noted
already, there are dangers associated with the penetration of title insurance as it has
the potential to unravel the state compensation scheme adversely affecting all
participants in the land market.
From the standpoint of those relying on the register it would be better to bring U
rights onto the register. They are likely to be interests that already exist and bind but
are just not shown on the register. The advantage of having them on the register for
future transactions is that they are less likely to be overlooked. This would also
beneﬁt U and V where their interest or claim is vulnerable to the effects of a
transfer.
As a general principle it is reasonable to ask people to protect interests that are of
value to them. Thus U and V should be asked to produce formal and veriﬁable
documentation and to lodge those with the registry in order to bring such interests
onto the register. It would be preferable not to have interests arising without such
documentation.
U and V, however, are a disparate group and include some parties who would not
be able to avoid the loss. For example those holding family interests or contributory
rights in a family setting may, in the absence of legal advice, not know that they
have a claim. If they do not know they have a claim, they cannot act to protect
it. Also some claims do not produce documents. For example those based on
adverse possession or prescription and informal interests generally. A problem
with proofs will make registration difﬁcult to achieve. Questions arise as to who
pays for the cost of proving the claim, what mechanisms for poof are needed and
what if the proof accepted by the registering authority is then challenged in court?
Thus a signiﬁcant claimant group may suffer if U and V are disposed of or
required to come onto the register. Any solution designed for a particular type of U
interest or V claim is likely to throw up issues for another type of U interest or V
claim. An overarching mechanism for dealing with all U interests and V claims is
likely to have unintended consequences for other participants in the land market.
Without examining each potential interest or claim it is not possible to be prescrip-
tive in making recommendations for how to deal with U and V. Instead some key
principles are set out in the context of asking if the advantages of eConveyancing
9.6

307

are sufﬁcient to merit the injustice that might be caused to individual third parties or
property claimants.
9.6.3
Grounds for Increased Risk to U and V
The beneﬁts of eConveyancing to land owners are signiﬁcant and may provide
grounds for the increased risk to U and V. In particular it appears that many of the
beneﬁts of eConveyancing can only be realised by increased reliance and certainty
in land registration. This lends itself to the elimination of exceptions to indefeasi-
bility. Moving U and V onto the register may be a desirable and feasible solution
that provides the beneﬁts of eConveyancing and allocates the reduction in risk in
the longer term among the greatest number of participants in the land market. B, C
and to a lesser extent, Y would beneﬁt.
In Mason’s view the essence of the system, the Australasia Torrens system in his
commentary, must be to provide a regime of registration that provides security of
title, is inexpensive and enables prompt registration of interests.67 eConveyancing
may provide the means to achieve all of these to a greater degree than heretofore. In
eConveyancing the participants who already register their interest will continue to
do so and they will be able to achieve the protection of registration in a more timely
manner. Such protection will then be of increased quality. This will likely lead to a
more secure and effective land market.
As eConveyancing drives towards simpliﬁcation and standardisation of property
rights, certainty of the register will be valued above ﬂexibility. Security of regis-
tered title is likely to be enhanced and this will lead to a reduction in the exceptions
to indefeasibility. In personam claims, equitable interests, adverse possession and
overriding interests may be limited or eliminated. eConveyancing may achieve
what has eluded the title register to date; the register and the register alone becomes
the arbiter of title.
9.7
Recommendations
The following recommendations are made in order to maximise the beneﬁts of
eConveyancing while also mitigating the potentially harsh effect of these changes
on participants in conveyancing transactions:
(a)
An automated eConveyancing system retains the role of the registering author-
ity and keeps the state compensation scheme intact.68
67 Mason (2003), p. 18.
68 See conclusion to Chap. 7.
308
9
Conclusion

(b)
Reduce or eliminate the registration gap without implementing an automatic
eConveyancing system.69
(c)
Priority entry is a useful tool to seal any remaining registration gap.70
(d)
The lesser protection given to a volunteer should be maintained.71
(e)
Robust system design provides the opportunity to reduce the risk of non
compliance with the formalities for registration however this must be balanced
against any contractual constraints that might be imposed.72
(f)
Further research is required to establish if eConveyancing of itself will lead to
increased fraud.73
(g)
The nature of indefeasibility as it applies to the title register in Ireland requires
debate and discussion. Examining the results of various measures across the
common law world may provide some guidance to the courts in assessing the
impact of risk to participants in the conveyancing process.74
(h)
Robust system design has the potential to reduce registry errors.75
(i)
Review overriding interests as a category of property rights to establish how
this category will operate in an eConveyancing environment or to determine if
these rights should be reclassiﬁed. If this category is to be retained review all
overriding interests individually to update but where possible overriding
interests should be abolished, subject to the policy imperatives of the law,
the practicalities of the conveyancing and land administration processes and
the due protection of property rights under the Irish Constitution and the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms.76
(j)
Further research is required to determine the impact of the increased emphasis

(m) It must be acknowledged that eConveyancing will copper fasten registration of
title and registration of title will enhance eConveyancing.80
(n)
Given the success of the initial eRegistration initiatives and the move towards
a complete title register the timing is right for Ireland to implement
eConveyancing.81
(o)
While the experience in other jurisdictions provides valuable insights Ireland
must develop its own system.82
Conclusions
Treacy and O’Sullivan are of the view that while any model of how an
electronic service should work “can draw heavily from experiences in other
countries, especially other common law jurisdictions, it must also be designed
to take account of practices and procedures unique to Ireland.”83 Thus an
eConveyancing system must accommodate local conditions and practice
variations. A unique case in point is the federal system in Australia which
has to meet the needs of all states and territories84
Countries have a wide range of different cultures, sizes, politics,
populations, traditions, philosophies, resources, development needs, stake-
holders, systems, regional and geopolitical requirements and thus what is best
for one may be unworkable for another.
The development and maintenance of land markets involves the interaction of
complex political, economic, social and cultural issues, legal frameworks, ﬁscal
policies and environmental controls. Their impact on society and the local economy
varies from nation to nation and depends much upon what is happening in other parts
of the national and global economies.85
Best practice must be society speciﬁc and no one size ﬁts all. While
lessons can be learned from other countries only each individual jurisdiction
can decide what is best for its citizens.
The Irish conveyancing process has speciﬁc practices and procedures that
will need to be taken into account in designing any model of eConveyancing.
Such contextual factors will make some elements of the model more vital and
others less important when compared with models developed elsewhere. For
example, closing the registration gap may be less of an imperative in juris-
dictions where completion and registration are closely aligned.

Conclusion

There is merit in further legislative reform to review the category of
overriding interests but also to align and consolidate the registration of title
statute, the 1964 Act, with the primary piece of conveyancing legislation; the
2009 Act. Also the current recessionary climate in Ireland has introduced
additional delay in the conveyancing process86 and tight constraints on
lending.87 The high percentage of home ownership and afﬁnity for land
means that the security of the conveyancing process and registration system
is an essential part of the social fabric in Ireland and cannot lightly be
tinkered with.
In many jurisdictions progress towards eConveyancing has been slower
than previously anticipated. Developing the technology has been more difﬁ-
cult and costly than expected and the costs have proved harder to justify
whilst the beneﬁts have seemed less assured in the context of government
retrenchment, a slow land market and a general economic recession. Thus
empirical data must be gathered to clearly show the merits of the business
case for all stakeholders. In order to do this more progress has to be made in
developing methodologies and ontologies. This will allow the deﬁnition of
concepts and terminology for further research and establish appropriate
indicators to compare conveyancing and eConveyancing systems and
processes.
Any conceptualisation must take into account conceptualisations already
established in other domains such as economics, political sciences and
geosciences, given the relationship of land to other socio-economic ﬁelds.
In referring to research on the cadastre Sliva and Stubkjær point out that the
methodologies used are largely those of the social sciences as the cadastre
relates as much to people as it relates to land and that cadastral systems,
which in their view includes the land register,88 are shaped by social, political
and economic conditions, as by legal and technological factors.89 Thus the
conveyancing system must not be viewed in isolation.
Taking into account the overall tenets of eConveyancing it is possible to
design a system that introduces new controls on existing risks and provides
for a net reduction in risk for land owners compared with paper based
conveyancing. Any increase in a speciﬁc risk will be compensated by an
overall increase in beneﬁts however there must be a recognition that no
(continued)
86 Among other changes, additional property taxes and charges have been introduced which add to
the enquiries that need to be carried out by a transferee.
87 Loan offers are valid for shorter periods and can be withdrawn at any time. Loan to value ratios
have reduced. Only those in very secure employment are in a position to obtain loan funds so
generally the market is restricted to cash purchasers.

commercial activity is completely without risk. Each jurisdiction will need to
assess the risk and reward and this will be judged in light of the aversion to or
appetite for risk.
The arguments for and against eConveyancing has resonance in many
spheres be they cultural, political, social, judicial, economic or constitutional.
Principles about the ownership of property and the protection of interests in
land impact on every citizen and every activity and thus major changes should
not be lightly implemented. Sufﬁcient thought must be given to the overall
strategy and impact of the goals of reform. Thought must be given to the fact
that conveyancing is not just a process of transferring land but it has a wider
remit as a tax and social control mechanism.
However,
[o]nce we have. . .[eConveyancing], it is a safe bet that few would want to be without
it. It will become a part of life, just like electronic rail tickets or theatre bookings.
Reluctance will become the province of the few because any streamlining exercise
has its victims, and it will be a tremendous challenge. . .to ﬁnd an acceptable way to
safeguard those whose interests appear to be squashed by the new requirements....As
electronic conveyancing is implemented, we may well be able to say that we have
moved from a state of general reluctance with a few enthusiasms, to one where a few
are reluctant and enthusiasm is general.90
To date such enthusiasm has manifested itself primarily in the develop-
ment of eRegistration systems. These provide an easier route to reform
through the control and force of central government. While this demonstrates
the art of the possible, it is eConveyancing that provides the potential for
re-engineering of the conveyancing process for the twenty-ﬁrst century.
The experience in Ontario provides valuable insights into how Ireland
might move into such unchartered territory but ultimately Ireland must decide
for itself how it will balance the risks and rewards of implementing
eConveyancing.
