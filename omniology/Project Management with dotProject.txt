About the Author
Lee Jordan is a web developer with a large collection of web technology acronyms 
on her resume that sound like the names of laundry detergent and cause glazed 
expressions in school children. She designs and maintains internal and external 
enterprise-level websites and web-based applications as part of a project team for a 
privately held technical services company. Her work includes proposing, writing, 
and editing web content and user guides people actually read.
She began her career in 1997 as a web designer after graduating from Florida State 
University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, where she swears that she missed at least 
one home football game while in the computer lab. Lee later convinced Seminole 
Community College to give her a Web Programming degree in 2003, even though her 
final project was a Java-based application that actually contained a usable help file. 
Web development topics or whatever she can think of at the time are posted on her 
blog at http://leesjordan.net.
To Nanda Padmanabhan, Abhijeet Deobhakta, and everyone else 
at Packt Publishing. Their patience, professionalism, and guidance 
throughout this project have made all the difference.

To the creators and developers of dotProject whose focus and 
dedication to dotProject and the Open Source community is 
overwhelming.

To my children for their hugs and curiosity. There are few things as 
humbling as trying to explain a technical topic to a six year old. 

To Brian Kershner for listening to my ideas being critical when I 
needed it.

My husband Brian (not the same one, a different and unique Brian): 
Always, always, always.

To my Mom and Dad. They encouraged me to read, read, read when 
I was growing up.

discusses standard navigation paths, navigation shortcuts, and tips on how to move 
around dotProject. 
Chapter 4 covers the general modules used in dotProject and shows how to get things 
done: setting up and maintaining companies, contacts, projects, and file areas of 
dotProject from a user perspective. dotProject uses a sophisticated version control 
system for files, which this chapter covers in detail.

Preface
[  ]
Chapter 5 examines all the areas of system administration within dotProject: language/
translation management, system configuration, PostNuke and LDAP authentication, 
module management, and user administration including permission setup.
Chapter 6 focuses on customizing the look and feel of a standard dotProject system. 
We explore different ways to modify the appearance and settings of dotProject to

with dotProject.
What You Need for This Book
You will need Apache web server (version 1.3.x or 2.x), MySQL server (version 3.23.
x), PHP 4.1 or higher, and dotProject. 2.0.4 or later is ideal. 
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
There are three styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can 
include other contexts through the use of the include directive."
A block of code will be set as follows: 
A:link{
         color: #006600;/*was 08245b*/
         text-decoration: underline;/*was none*/
      }

Preface
[  ]
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the 
relevant lines or items will be made bold:
BODY{
       background-color: #cc66cc;/*was #f0f0f0*/
       margin-top: 0px;
       margin-left: 0px;
       margin-right: 0px;
       margin-bottom: 10px;
       font-family: Osaka,verdana,Sans-Serif;
       font-size: 10pt;ss
    }
New terms and important words are introduced in a bold-type font. Words that you 
see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in our text like this: 
"clicking the Next button moves you to the next screen". 
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Introducing dotProject
dotProject is an open-source Project Management Application (PMA), maintained 
by committed volunteers with the goal of providing a project management 
environment that is free for everyone. The volunteers use the term "project 
management environment" to describe their philosophy behind dotProject. To them, 
dotProject is not another collaboration tool or groupware application. They see 
dotProject as the forest and project information as the trees. dotProject is not just a 
place to put all the project documentation and contact information; it is the hub of all 
project activity.
This chapter will introduce you to dotProject, and covers the following:
What a project management application is and why you need one
What the core features of dotProject are
Why dotProject is the right PMA for you
How to find and get to know the dotProject community
What is a Project Management 
Application? 
If you walked up to someone and asked them to quickly name a project 
management application they might say "Email," or "Microsoft Project", or "You 
mean our intranet, right?" Actually what they would probably do is stare at you 
blankly and say, "Huh?"
A project management application is an intimidating term for a simple concept: 
keeping an eye on all projects using a single program.

Introducing dotProject
[  ]
What are the Features Required of a PMA? 
Project management applications should all contain certain core features to be useful 
to users. A PMA usually has the following characteristics:
Projects are created in a central location, using a standardized process. All 
users involved in project planning and creation create and store their project 
information in the same place, the same way every time. 
Information about progress can be tracked using automatically created charts 
and alert systems. Color-coded time alerts and email notifications keep 
everyone involved in a project easily informed of the status of assignments. 
Projects can be categorized and tasks defined deeply or loosely. A user can 
create a project about a small task that has a short time frame, such as a minor 
site upgrade, or a large year-long project, that will require resources from 
multiple departments, many files, and a carefully planned list of activities.
Measurement tools such as calendars, resource allocation, and time 
calculators assist users in managing projects. These tools should be easy to 
use and located close to where they are needed. A resource allocation tool 
should be accessible as a tab or window when a new task is created. 
So are project management applications useful, or are they just something else 
to take up our time during the day? There are many benefits of using a project 
management application. The stakeholders and users have a centralized place for 
project information. Well-designed systems include some type of project team 
contact system, a place to store project files, version control, project status in graph or 
chart form, and a place to discuss project topics. Motivating project team members to 
add new projects and update information is the key to a system being useful. 
The stakeholders of the project management system, be they the vice-president of 
the company or a department manager, should be champions of the application and 
encourage others to use it. Without their support, it may be difficult to persuade 
people not on the core project team to see updating the application as worth their 
time. Users need to be shown how it will actually save them time and be a tool for 
them to use.
Communication between project members is a crucial part of any project 
management system. Email works fine until someone is sick, goes on vacation, or 
leaves the company; the project information is trapped in email limbo. If a project 
management system was used, members could still email each other from within the 
system, but all the key information would be stored in a central location. Other forms 
of communication are available at any time: forums, file repositories, or task logs. 
Any serious PMA should provide communication tools such as these.

What is dotProject?
dotProject enables you to create, track, and maintain your projects online. It provides 
enterprise-level project management tools that include contact management, an 
email notification system, and an online system to create and manage projects. 
The intuitive color codes indicate if you are headed for hot water. It is created, 
maintained, and developed by volunteers like you and me. 
dotProject is free to use. The software license is BSD, GNU General Public License 
(GPL), which means it is free software provided as is with no warranty. The 
full license should be available in the folder where your installation of dotProject 
resides. You can learn more about this type of license at 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.
When a user first logs in, they will see a personalized view of dotProject. The screen 
will display the events and tasks they are members of, including a full list of specific 
projects and tasks they are assigned to. The user can navigate to different areas as 
specified on the navigation bar, which will be displayed on the top or the left side of 
the screen. 
dotProject is an online project management application. You will need a browser and 
either intranet or Internet access. 

Introducing dotProject
[  ]
dotProject is surprisingly versatile. A few of the many things you can do in 
dotProject are: 
Set up a project and its tasks
Communicate with everyone on the project team from within dotProject
See projects as Gantt charts
Check task progress quickly with Calendar and Events 
dotProject has great features for communicating with your contacts and 
resources. Even so, it is not intended as a groupware tool. Groupware is generally 
used to describe desktop or web-based applications that enable users to work 
collaboratively. There are often forums, chat environments, wikis, or email tools that 
are all-purpose in nature. Choosing a groupware over a focused application could 
be compared to offering a guest a wide variety of pies, cakes, and cookies for dessert 
when you know they have a deep and abiding love for cheesecake with raspberry 
and chocolate sauce. 
dotProject is focused specifically on project management instead of being a generic 
groupware application. It does contain forums, calendar, and email functionality 
that are often associated with groupware tools, so that users can collaborate 
for the purpose of project management. The phrase, "for the purpose of project 
management" is the key difference between dotProject and groupware. The narrow 
focus on the needs of those involved in managing projects makes dotProject more 
useful to users than a generic tool. No project is too large or too small, whether you 
are trying to get the band back together or developing enterprise software projects. 
dotProject is useful in many ways. There are features of dotProject that make using 
it a much more pleasant experience, like user-specific to-do lists and events: when a 
user logs in, they immediately see what project events they are involved in and what 
tasks are assigned to them. 
What are the Core Features of 
dotProject?
The answer will actually depend on what your company uses dotProject for. A 
user with admin access has a great deal of control over what modules are active, 
displayed, or hidden, and who can use them. If a particular set of modules are not 
needed, they can be deactivated. There are 10 key features that make up the core 
of dotProject.

These are central to the dotProject philosophy of creating an environment for users: 
1.	 User Management
2.	 Email-based Trouble Ticket System 
3.	 Client/Company Management
4.	 Project Listings
5.	 Hierarchical Task List
6.	 File Repository
7.	 Contact List
8.	 Calendar
9.	 Discussion Forum
10.	 Resource-Based Permissions

please refer to the following link:

Core Features in Detail
User Management: A simple feature, for tracking user activity, adding users, and 
managing users. User sessions showing date last logged in and other information 
are available.
Email-based Trouble Ticket System, (Integrated voxel dot net's Ticketsmith): 
A ticket‑tracking system. Some use dotProject as a helpdesk or combination CRM 
(Customer Resource Management) tool. 
Email notification for assignees: This feature is on by default whenever a new task 
is created. User assignees will receive information about the task they were assigned 
to unless you choose not to have the notification sent.
Client/Company Management: A digital rolodex of contact information that can 
be used to identify projects that directly affect customers or external clients. Basic 
default classifications and categories are already set up in the Companies module. A 
tabbed interface allows users to quickly see how many vendors, suppliers, and other 
types of companies are on the list. See screenshot overleaf.

Introducing dotProject
[ 10 ]
Project listings: Lists of projects are broken down by what state they are in, such as 
all projects, proposed, planning, in progress, on hold, complete, template, archived, 
not defined. You can quickly move from tab to tab to view the state of the projects. 
The number of projects listed in each state is in parenthesis on each tab. 
Layered project and task details: The minimum amount you need to know is 
displayed. Text links allow the user to drill down into the project or task for more 
information if required. Tasks can also be organized by precedence, dependencies, 
and time.

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Hierarchical Task List: Tasks are organized in a hierarchy, not just arbitrarily listed. 
This is a very useful feature. Tasks can be dependent on other tasks. 
Instant Color-Coded Progress: Instantly see if your project is in danger with 
intuitive color codes. If your task is highlighted with dark pink or red, it is past due.
File Repository: The file repository is a central place to store project documents. 
They can be viewed from the central repository or from the project they are stored 
under. Files can be uploaded without being associated with a specific project. They 
will appear under the All Projects heading in the repository. 
The file system strictly controls how files are downloaded and uploaded. All files can 
be assigned a version number. The check-in and check-out process can be confusing. 
We will spend some quality time covering it in Chapter 3, where I will help you 
avoid the embarrassing mistakes I have made using this feature.
Contact List: The contact list can be used intuitively within project listings themselves. 
This is a feature I am thankful for every time I have to edit or create a new task.

Introducing dotProject
[ 12 ]
Calendar: The calendar has several display options, including a three-month 
mini-calendar view, a day view, week view, and a comprehensive month view. A 
full screen version of the calendar is only a click away on the navigation bar. There 
you can see a holistic view of all the projects and tasks. There is also a three-month 
mini-calendar that displays on the Today screen. 
Discussion Forum: The forum module can be used to share project-specific news 
and information. It is integrated into dotProject. Everyone can view what is said in 
the forum. Threaded discussion forums can be created to discuss particular projects. 
All forums must be associated with projects. Forums can be moderated, and follow a 
standard post topic, reply, add new topic format. 
Resource-Based Permissions: The permissions system in versions 2.0 and above 
is role based. It is granular, meaning there are many variations that can be used to 
specify access to the areas you want and to prevent access. Users can have read-only 
access to certain modules by role. Role-based permissions are intuitive. If most of 
the people using dotProject will be project managers, a project manager role can be 
created, and then individual users can be added to the system. Roles must be in place 
before a user is added. Think of it as a job. A job must be created, and then a person 
hired to fill the job position. This is a very important feature. 
User-specific to-do lists and events: When a user logs in, they immediately see what 
project events they are involved in and what tasks are assigned to them.
Why dotProject is the Right PMA for You
So far we have examined what project management applications are, what they 
should do, and taken a high-level look at what features dotProject has to offer. 
Determining what project management tool best suits an organization calls for 
awareness of which features are critical and which are negotiable.
dotProject is the right choice for organizations that need a project management 
application that has no fees, has a generous license agreement, is stable, works on all 
the major browsers, has a supportive community, has permissions that are granular, 
and is scalable. It is open source, not a commercial application. There are no license 
fees, maintenance fees, or purchasing fees. For organizations on a tight budget, the 
price is right. 
It has a history of integration with other popular open-source projects such as 
PostNuke. It's modular. Use only the modules you need. Don't want to use the 
Forums module? Disable it. It shares many advantages of other open-source, 
developer-maintained applications, in that it is relatively lightweight and can be 
customized by users or by contracting with its developers.

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
dotProject does have limitations. Its focused approach may turn off those looking for 
an all-in-one project development suite. There is no module for creating diagrams, 
for example. The ability of dotProject to integrate with other applications as part of a 
larger, customized group is a potential solution.

Instead of creating projects arbitrarily as we move through the book, we will stick 
to "ProjectRUs", an imaginary project that will help us illustrate the concepts we 
learn. ProjectRUs is a technology company that has an extensive list of services, 
including consulting, Web development, Internet marketing and of course Project 
Management Services.
Even fictitious companies have employees, so in the course of the examples seen 
in the book; you will meet Lee Jordan, who moonlights as a System Administrator 
when she is not writing technical books. You will also bump into Happy UserPerson, 
happily designing some new modules for clients of ProjectRUs, and many others.
Summary
This chapter gives an overview about dotProject. dotProject can be easily set up 
within a day, yet has many complex attributes that a casual setup might miss. The 
true usefulness of this feature-rich application is both its surface simplicity and its 
hidden depths. We've defined what a project management application is and types of 
things they typically do.
Here we also demonstrated how dotProject fits in PMA landscape and what makes 
dotProject a popular tool. If we are in trouble and cannot figure out how to proceed 
with the tool, we can get assistance from the dotProject community, which has 
been introduced here. This book will gradually unfold the advantages of working 
with dotProject. And to do that we first need to install dotProject, which has been 
discussed in detail in the next chapter. We will start really getting things done with 
dotProject after that, covering the distinctive dotProject interface. 


Installing dotProject
If you already have dotProject installed, you probably don't even need to skim 
this chapter, unless something has gone horribly wrong. We will cover the key 
information you need to know to successfully install dotProject, what to do if things 
are not working right, and how to avoid common pitfalls and hours of frustration. 
This chapter will include:
dotProject setup options including server, database, and browser issues
Prerequisites for installation of the tool
The process for control panels and browser-based installations
Troubleshooting your installation
Installing dotProject is usually an automated process if your server and database 
are already installed and configured. dotProject is packaged with an installation 
wizard that walks you through the basic setup process. It is always wise to have an 
understanding of the process and the setup options before you begin. 
Prerequisites
It is important to make sure that everything is ready and in place for dotProject to 
be installed. Let's go over what we need to have prepared for a successful installation 
of dotProject.

Installing dotProject
[ 16 ]
Before you Install 
It seems redundant to review the requirements again, doesn't it? There are a few 
last-minute things to discuss, especially if a control panel installation is not possible. 
First, make sure that the software required to run dotProject is already installed. 
Installing a web server, MySQL, and PHP is beyond the scope of this book. 
There are many fine books and online materials that explain the installation of 
web servers, MySQL, and PHP in detail. The dotProject team recommends the 
following environment: 
Apache web server (version 1.3.x or 2.x). 
MySQL server (version 3.23.x). 
A downloaded copy of dotProject. 2.0.4 or later is ideal. The most recent 
stable release can be downloaded from SourceForge. 
MySQL should be set up first, so that a dotProject user can create temporary 
tables during installation. Specifically, the database user should have ALTER 
and DROP permissions. 
In the section on browser-based installation, we will go over how to deal 
with the config.php file. If your installation already contains a config.php 
file (not a config_dist.php file, etc.), then dotProject will assume you are 
trying to upgrade. 
Your PHP installation should have register_globals set to OFF in order for 
dotProject to run in an optimized and more secure mode. The dotProject installer 
automatically detects the state of register_globals. dotProject will work with 
register_globals set to ON, but it is not recommended. 
LAMP, WAMP, or WIMP?
There are several key requirements to run dotProject. You must have an active web 
server running PHP and MySQL, and an Internet browser. There are three main 
web-server setups that people running dotProject use. Which one you pick depends 
on what you already have and whether you have a preference for one over the 
other. If you use an Internet Service Provider (ISP) you may not have a choice on 
which to use.
LAMP : Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
WAMP : Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP
WIMP : Windows, IIS, MySQL, PHP 
LAMP is the most popular in the open-source community. 
Using LAMP provides an entirely open-source environment.

Web Server
Most web servers used today are either Apache or Microsoft IIS. Apache version 
1.3.x or 2.x should be used. Your ISP or that clever person in the IT department 
knows which one your organization is using. There are always exceptions, so check 
the dotProject forums if you are using a different web server.
Apache is the preferred environment for running dotProject.
PHP
To install dotProject 2.0, you must be using version 4.1 or higher of the very popular 
online programming language PHP. If you are using an Internet Service Provider, 
check your service details to see if PHP is provided. PHP can be downloaded from 
http://www.php.net/downloads.php. PHP 4.46 is the last stable version of PHP 4. 
PHP 5 is not recommended for use with version 2.0.4.
MySQL
dotProject uses the MySQL database system. You will need to have it installed before 
you begin as well. Version 3.23.x is recommended for use with dotProject. MySQL 
can be downloaded from http://www.mysql.org/downloads/. The dotProject 
team recommends that MySQL version 5 and above should not be used with version 
2.0.4 of dotProject.
The recent release of dotProject, version 2.1.0-rc 1 has been made 
more compatible with PHP 5 and MySQL 5; however, the changes 
incorporated does not take care of this completely. The features of 
this release are discussed in http://docs.dotproject.net/
index.php/What%27s_New_-_2.1.0_-_rc1.
Windows
Using a bundled combination of PHP/Apache/MySQL is the best way to go if 
you do not already have them installed. This will save you the time and headache 
of installing them one at a time. The dotProject volunteers list the Apache2Triad 
available at http://apache2triad.sourceforge.net. Since there are limitations 
of dotProject being compatible with PHP5, version 1.2.3 is the download that 
is advisable. 

Installing dotProject
[ 18 ]
Browser
dotProject works best with browsers that support cascading style sheets (CSS) 
and JavaScript. JavaScript and cookies should be turned on for full functionality. 
Most recent browsers such as Internet Explorer (version 5.5 or better), Mozilla 1.2, 
Netscape 7.x, and Firefox will work just fine. dotProject's PNG image files with 
alpha-transparency render best in Internet Explorer 6.0 and above. Internet Explorer 
7 provides increased support for PNG image files. 
Mail Server
As of version 2.0, sending mail is not a requirement. Administrators can set up the 
outgoing mail in the Administration panel. 
Fonts
TrueType fonts are used for JpGraph, which is in turn used by the Gantt charts 
module. Most of the fonts JpGraph uses should already be installed on your system. 
All the fonts are not provided with dotProject because some of them have very 
specific licenses. If the Gantt charts module is insisting that font files are missing 
and you don't already have a spare copy of the files, search SourceForge or another 
reliable site for available fonts.
Memory Limit
The Gantt charts module can eat up your allocated memory. If the Gantt charts won't 
appear, and there is no error, chances are, you've reached your memory limit as set 
in the php.ini file. If your service is hosted, you will need to talk to your Internet 
Service Provider about increasing the memory limit set in your php.ini file.
Installation
There are two methods of dotProject installation:
1.	 Online control panel installation
2.	 Browser-based installation
The most recent versions of dotProject, 2.0 and later, are not meant to be manually 
installed. The online control panel method is very simple and usually takes between 
five and ten minutes. The browser-based installation generally takes a little longer, 
roughly ten minutes to an hour.

Chapter 2
[ 19 ]
Which should you choose? If you already have an ISP who hosts your domain, 
they probably already provide you with an installation script for dotProject using 
one of the popular online control panels such as cPanel or Plesk. If they do not 
have the script available, they may be willing to install it for you if you make the 
request. dotProject can also be installed using a browser-based installation wizard. 
I recommend the online control panel installation for people who want a quick 
installation or are not technically inclined. The browser installation method is best 
for IT administrators or those who are comfortable installing web applications. If 
your only choice is a browser installation, don't worry; we will walk through one 
later in this chapter
Backup First
It is always smart to take back up of any crucial files or databases that might be 
affected by a new installation. Always have a backup plan when a new installation is 
about to be performed.
Installing with an Online Control Panel
Most control panel installations can be completed in a few steps. Be sure to write 
down or otherwise make a note of any file, folder paths, or other crucial information 
as you go. We will walk through a control panel installation using cPanel/Fantastico. 
If you have never used cPanel before, this is a great opportunity to get your feet wet. 
Your ISP should have provided you with a link to your cPanel when you first set 
up your service. You will need a user name and password provided by your ISP to 
log in to cPanel. Once you are logged in you will see a screen with icons for different 
online tools.
1.	 Log into your cPanel control panel.
2.	 Select Fantastico (double mouse-click). The Fantastico icon is usually located 
at the bottom right corner of the screen.

Installing dotProject
[ 20 ]
3.	 Scroll down the Fantastico screen until the Project Management category 
appears�.
Left mouse-click on dotProject. There will be a short description about 
dotProject. Make a note of the version of dotProject available. The latest 
stable installation should be listed. The version of dotProject is in parenthesis 
by the new installation link. We will be using version 2.0.4 in the examples.
4.	 Click on the New Installation link to begin the installation process.
Type in the name of the subfolder, where your dotProject installation 
should be installed. If you leave it blank, then dotProject will be installed 
in the root folder of the URL path. For example, if I had left the folder field 
blank, the install tool would have placed the dotProject files directly in the 
public_html folder of www.leesjordan.net. I do not recommend leaving 
the folder field blank unless you already have a special URL set aside or are 
using a sub-domain.

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
Enter the �����������������������������
username ��������������������
for your dotProject admin, and the Password. You can 
add more administrators after dotProject is installed. Choose the username 
carefully. It is very difficult to change it. 
5.	 Enter the email address of the dotProject administrator. A copy of the 
installation information will be sent to this email address.
6.	 Type the first and last name of the administrator.
7.	 Click the Install dotProject button when you are ready to continue. 

Installing dotProject
[ 22 ]
8.	 The second installation screen gives you confirmation of the installation 
process so far. You should see information about your dotProject database, 
your subdirectory folder or other location where dotProject is being installed, 
and the URL from which dotProject will be accessed. Click the Finish 
installation button for the final installation screen. 
9.	 The first thing you should see on the final installation screen is information 
about your config.php file and data.sql file. They should both have been 
successfully configured. The ���������������������������������������
username and password ��������������������
 chosen on screen 1 
should be ����������������������������������������������������������������
listed ����������������������������������������������������������
 again. Make note of them now if you haven't already. The 
administrator URL, which in this case is the same as the URL everyone 
will use, is displayed as well. The option to email a copy of the installation 
information is available. It is best to go ahead and send this information to 
a stakeholder or an alternative email address for backup purposes. If you 
choose not to send the information to another email address, then this is your 
last screen. Your installation process is done.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
An email confirmation screen will be displayed, after sending installation 
information to an additional email address. 

Installing dotProject
[ 24 ]
10.	 Now it is time to check the URL where dotProject was installed and to make 
sure it is up and running. Type the URL into the browser. The login screen 
should appear.
Warning: If you want to install a version that is not provided by 
your ISP, you will need to download the version from SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotproject/) and 
follow the browser installation process instead.
Browser-Based Installation 
How long will it take? A standard installation should take approximately 10 
minutes to an hour. Does this seem like a large range of time? If things go well, the 
installation will go quickly. If corrections have to be made, it will take a little longer. 
To prepare for installing dotProject, you will need:
The latest stable version downloaded from SourceForge either as a tar.gz or 
zip package at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotproject�/. 
A web server as described earlier in the chapter.
PHP 4.4 or above (but not 5) already installed on your server. If you have 
PHP 5 or greater, visit the dotProject forums if you run into any problems.
A database ready for your dotProject installation, preferably MySQL.
An Internet browser such as Firefox or Internet Explorer.

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
Carefully follow the instructions for installing PHP and a database on your server 
if they are not already provided by your service provider. If you do not know what 
version of PHP you have, you should be able to find out by running a PHPInfo() 
script. Be sure to delete the script after you have used it. Visit php.org to learn more 
about PHP if you are not sure how to do this. 
Database management and PHP information should be available on your control 
panel, if your ISP provides you with one. The database and PHP must be installed 
before trying to install dotProject. 
Hopefully no one has been scared off by the preparation necessary to manually 
install dotProject. Usually ISPs will already have PHP and MySQL available. 
We're going to walk through the installation using the zip file. Those of you who 
want to use the tar.gz version just need to unpack the tar ball where you want your 
installation to be. Why are you advanced people even reading this chapter? Beats 
me. OK, while the gifted students show-off the rest of us will take it slow, and do the 
install step by step. 
1.	 Unpack the zip file. By default it has the thrilling name of dotProject. 
You can do better than that, can't you? Yeah, I'll wait while you go ask 
permission. After you've chosen a name for your installation, we're ready to 
begin. Now for the easy stuff.
2.	 Fire up your FTP program and place the folder where you need it to go. 
If you are using a sub-domain, then you can install directly underneath 
it. If you are using a subfolder for your installation, place it under the 
public_html folder. Example: For this installation I am using the 
browserdp folder so the URL for my dotProject installation will be 
http://leesjordan.net/browserdp/. 
3.	 After the files are uploaded, point your browser at the installation subfolder. 
For this example it will be: http://leesjordan.net/browserdp/install/.
4.	 The Check for Requirements screen will be displayed. It should look similar 
to the one displayed overleaf. Notice that under Database Connectors there 
are many red 'X's with the phrase Not available. It is a very long screen, 
and shows many optional configurations. The only requirement under 
Database Connectors is for the MySQL database to be prepared. If any of the 
mandatory requirements are not met, the installation will not be successfull. 
The config.php file can actually be uploaded after the installation is done.

Enter the name of your database, the admin user, and the admin database user 
password. Click on install db & write cfg button. Be sure to have the drop existing 
database checkbox checked if you have a database you want to reuse. Make sure that 
the database name matches the one created in MySQL.

Installing dotProject
[ 28 ]
5.	 If your database was successfully created, a green success message Database 
successfully setup will be displayed������
. The config file creation feedback may 
display an error message in red. This is normal.
6.	 If the database setup was not successful, a screen like the following one will 
be displayed. Click the ��������������������������������������������������
back ����������������������������������������������
 button and double-check that you entered the 
database information correctly. Syntax is very important. The error screen 
looks like this:

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
Still having trouble? See the troubleshooting section in this chapter for 
more help.
7.	 Copy and paste the configuration file text into a text editor such as Notepad 
and save it as config.php. Upload the file to the server in the /includes/ 
subfolder of your dotProject folder.
The config file's properties should be set so that it is writable to the server or 
755 should do it. After you have uploaded the configuration file, it is time to 
take a look at the installed application.
8.	 Open a new browser window and type the full URL of your dotProject 
installation. For this example we would type: http://leesjordan.net/
browserdp/. A login screen like the one below should appear. The dotProject 
installation scripts create a default administrator username and password for 
you. Log in using the username as "admin" and the password as "passwd". 
You will want to change the password as soon as possible for security. 

Installing dotProject
[ 30 ]
You should now be finished with installing dotProject. The next section covers secure 
install with SSL, an optional method.
Secure your Installation with SSL 
Sensitive information is stored by many organizations on websites. If your company 
stores and/or shares project information, it may be necessary to encrypt it. Banks, 
medical organizations, government entities, or any other groups who have 
proprietary or private information can benefit from secured sites. 
Using an SSL certificate will provide an encrypted, more secure way to access 
dotProject. ���������������������������������������������������������������������������
Having an SSL certificate is not required for installing dotProject. Since 
there may be situations where a more secure installation is required, the dotProject 
volunteers have provided a code snippet for those using Apache servers. It is 
recommended that the SSL certificate be installed after dotProject. The installation of 
an SSL certificate is beyond the scope of this book.
Digicert, an SSL certificate provider, has detailed instructions for installation of 
certificates on many different servers. Visit http://www.digicert.com/ssl-
certificate-installation.htm for more details Your ISP may already provide 
secured hosting as part of your service package. Contact them for more information 
if you are not sure. If you see a /httpsdocs/ folder when you FTP into your domain, 
then a secure folder has already been prepared for you. 
The dotProject volunteers suggest that the following code be added to the end of the 
.htaccess file where the dotProject installation is located.
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !443$
RewriteRule ^(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
The code snippet will cause requests for http://sitedomain/ to be redirected 
to https://sitedomain/ instead, where sitedomain is the location of your 
dotProject installation.
Example: If http://www.leesjordan.net/browserdp/ was changed to an SSL site, 
the following steps would need to be followed:
1.	 Obtain an SSL certificate.
2.	 Install the certificate. 
3.	 Paste the code snippet above at the end of the web server's .htaccess file if 
using an Apache server.
4.	 The redirection should be to� https://www.leesjordan.net/browserdp/.

Troubleshooting
You faithfully followed the installation instructions and something horrible 
happened. Or, you went ahead and tried to install dotProject without reading the 
instructions and now want to know how to fix what went wrong. We will take a look 
at the most common issues that can occur when installing dotProject��. 
Database Installation Fails
The installer will create a database if you have checked the Create Database box 
and the MySQL user you have nominated has sufficient permission within MySQL 
to do so.
If the user does not have permission, it will fail.
 
If the database already exists (i.e. you have used some other means of creating it), 
you do not need to check the Create Database box. 

Installing dotProject
[ 32 ]
config.php Not Created
A config.php file must be in place for dotProject to operate properly.
Since this file is not automatically included as part of the installation, it is 
recommended that the config.php code shown in steps 5 and 7 (under the section 
Browser-Based Installation) should be copied and pasted into a text file then uploaded 
to the server. This should be done before attempting to log in to dotProject. The 
PHP file shown in the section on browser installation should work fine as long as 
the Database Name, Database User Name, and Database Password information 
are modified. So, don't use the exact ones I used in the example. If you are using an 
online control panel to manage your database, it will usually append the same group 
of letters to each new database you create. For example, you can see during the 
installation that my database began with "rumour", which happens to be the name 
of my cat. 

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
Using a Different Web Server/OS/Setup
Many different setups run dotProject successfully. Visit the dotProject forums at 
http://dotproject.net/vbulletin/ for installation help with a particular setup. 
Be sure to list all the details, including the operating system, web server, database, 
and programming language. Version numbers of these should also be included. 
Please read carefully about the compatibility of MySQL 5 and PHP 5.
dotProject Pages Display Differently for Me
Your dotProject installation pages do not look the same as the examples in this book. 
There are several different situations where this can happen. 
What browser and operating system are you using to view dotProject? dotProject 
uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files for presentation and formatting of most of the 
data. While most pages should display the same in all browsers, it is possible that 
there may be some differences between how they look on a Mac running Safari and 
for a Windows XP user running Internet Explorer 7.
What theme is being used as the default theme? The classic dotProject default theme 
is being used in this book. There are other themes available, which will alter the way 
dotProject looks.
The skin or "look" of dotProject can be further customized by altering the files in 
the styles folder. Back up any files before you attempt to make changes. We will 
discuss customizing dotProject in further detail in Chapter 6.
JpGraph/Gantt Fonts Error
An error message displays when the user attempts to go to the Todo section of 
dotProject or view Gantt charts. The actual error will depend on the web server and 
system configuration, but it will probably look similar to this:
Errors of this type usually occur when the font file cannot be found. dotProject does 
not install the fonts for JpGraph by default. This issue is discussed fully in Appendix 
B of this book. 

Installing dotProject
[ 34 ]
Summary
In this chapter we installed dotProject in several different ways and covered what 
to do when things go wrong. The quickest way to install dotProject was using a 
control panel. Installing dotProject using the browser took more time, and required 
a little bit more technical know how. Now you should be able to install dotProject 
successfully using a control panel or a browser. This chapter also delves into 
common installation issues and how we can elude them.
At the end of this chapter, dotProject has been successfully installed. The user 
interface and navigation system will be covered in Chapter 3.

dotProject User Basics
To understand the tool better and increase our proficiency, we will start with 
examining the interface and navigation components of dotProject in this chapter. 
dotProject uses a graphical user interface, commonly called a GUI (pronounced 
gooey), that includes image and text links for navigation. There are many different 
ways to get to the more popular features in dotProject. We will talk about navigation 
shortcuts and tips as well as the standard navigation paths.
This chapter will include:
A detailed look at the dotProject interface
How to use the navigation menus
Tips on getting around in dotProject
The dotProject Interface
Let's take a look around. Logging in to dotProject shows the Today screen in Day 
View mode by default. Unfortunately, there is no way for users to set their own 
unique default screen at this time. The actual default page you see after logging 
in will be different if your system administrator has altered the default setup. 
For example, the administrator could set the default sub-module to be Todo. The 
Todo screen will then display every time users log in. Why did the developers of 
dotProject make the Today screen in the� Day View mode the default view? Most 
users who log in to dotProject will be working on project tasks as part of their 
regularly scheduled work.

dotProject User Basics
[ 36 ]
Modules = Sections
The different sections of the dotProject application are divided into 
modules. Modules are self contained mini-applications that can be 
disabled, activated, and configured to customize dotProject. 
Each menu item shown on the main navigation menu is a 
dotProject module.
There is no one central "home" screen for dotProject. Instead, each modular area has 
its own section. The core areas can all be accessed using the main navigation menu 
located on the top or left, depending on the dotProject theme being used. 
Too many tasks displayed?
If there are too many tasks on one screen, we can check select boxes 
to filter tasks.
The actual navigation links you are able to see will depend upon the user rights 
assigned to you by the administrator of your dotProject application. We will discuss 
the default interface in this chapter. Most users will see the following menu items 
listed on the navigation bar: Companies, Projects, Tasks, Files, Contacts, Forums, 
and Tickets. Users with administrative rights will also see the User Admin and 
System Admin menu items.
dotProject looks similar to a website. There is a "header area" for a company logo 
or banner, a top navigation area, and a content area known as the work pane in the 
central portion of the page, which changes depending on what section of dotProject 
the user is in.
The header area, top navigation area, and the user menu do not change from section 
to section in dotProject. They will be the same on every page. The work pane will 
change depending on what section of the dotProject application the user is in.
A dynamic menu is displayed below the work pane heading of each page. This 
menu will change depending upon what page the user is currently on or what access 
rights the user has been given. On the screenshot opposite the Day View screen is 
displayed. Dynamic content such as the choice of month view or week view, the 
current date, and tabs for different sections of the work pane are shown. The Tasks 
tab is the active area displayed. This dynamic content area stretches from below the 
page title heading Day View to the end of the content area window. 

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
The user can view tasks assigned to them and control what tasks are displayed using 
the selection boxes. Tasks can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon to the left of 
each task. The tasks or companies can be viewed by clicking on their titles. See the 
following screenshot:
Get to Assigned Tasks Quickly
Click on the Task name or on the pencil icon to the left of the task.
Need to create new items such as Companies, Contacts, Files, or Tasks? There is 
a quick-start drop-down menu in the uppermost right corner. All items that a user 
has permission to access will appear in the drop-down menu. A user menu is in the 
upper, right corner of the screen. The user menu provides quick links to each user's 
personal work and preferences within dotProject. We will discuss it in more detail in 
the next section. The new event button shown below the user menu is a contextual 
button that will change depending upon the screen a user is on. On the projects 
screen it will become the new project button. The small, circular life preserver icon 
is a way to reach the help menu. The work area begins just below the section title on 
every dotProject screen.

dotProject User Basics
[ 38 ]
User Menu
The user menu provides a quick way for users to go to different screens containing 
information just for them. The main navigation system is for areas central to all 
users, while the user menu displays mainly information of particular concern to that 
user. With the exception of the Help link, all the other user menu links are that user's 
personal area of dotProject. 
There are four links in the user menu by default:
Help: Links to online help with dotProject.
My Info: User information such as name, department, birthday, email, and 
other contact details.
Todo: Tasks assigned to the users and Gantt chart items. The user's own 
tasks are shown by default. Other users' tasks can also be viewed using the 
drop‑down menu if the user has access.
Today: Day View displaying tasks and events assigned to the user. The Day 
View is shown by default. A month or week view is also available to view.
The user menu is available from anywhere in dotProject. It is always one click away 
from any screen the user is currently in.

Change Password
You can change your dotProject password by clicking on the 
change password link on the right side of the View User screen
Help (Online)
The help screen appears as a pop-up window or as a content page within dotProject. 
It lists different online resources available to dotProject users. The Help screen is 
available from the main navigation menu, the user menu, and by clicking on the life 
preserver icon just below the user menu. The help icon looks like a floatation device 
and has a red background .
The Help screen, also known as dotProject Online Assistance, lists five main sources 
of information about dotProject.

dotProject User Basics
[ 40 ]
My Info
The My Info screen, also known as the View User screen, shows information 
specific to the user such as their user name, company, department, IM, email, and 
other contact information. Only the Real Name and Email are required fields, while 
the others are optional. There is also a quick overview of Projects available on the 
bottom section of the screen, with different filters.
Users can also change their personal preferences as long as the system administrator 
has given the user edit access. How can a user check their permissions access? 
Clicking on the Permissions tab will display what rights a user has in dotProject.

A typical user has access to non-admin modules: Companies, Projects, Tasks, 
Calendar, Files, Contacts, and Forums. Below we can see after clicking on the 
permissions tab for Happy UserPerson that Happy can see all non-admin modules 
(referred to as allow). Happy can also Add, Edit, and View the Companies, Projects, 
Tasks, Files, Contacts, Forums, and Events tabs��. Happy cannot add new users, 
since that is an administrative function and Happy does not have access to any 
administrative modules. Permissions will be discussed in depth in Chapter 5.

Edit User Preferences (for Users)
Want to change your date format? Set your tabbed box view to flat or tabbed on 
all your screens? Change the notification settings for Tasks? Liven up the GUI 
style? The edit preferences option will give the user the options shown in the 
following screenshot:
Locale: Choose from several versions of English including US (American) 
and AU (Australian). Other languages will be available if the language packs 
have been added to the dotProject installation. This is covered in detail 
in Chapter 5.
Tabbed Box View: Users can view tabs, a flat link view, or either. This does 
not change the links themselves. It changes how they appear.
Short Date Format: Choose from several different formats for dates.
Time Format: Twelve hour (hour:minutes), twenty-four hour (hour:minutes), 
and twenty-four hour detailed (hour:minutes:seconds).
Currency Format: Choose from several different international currencies. The 
choices will depend upon the language packs installed.

Yes, dotProject shouldn't display buttons or links users cannot use, but as a safety 
measure, the warning message is displayed and the user is unable to perform the 
action they attempted. 
The Todo List
There are two main tabs on the Todo list: the My Tasks tab and the My Gantt tab. 
Both tabs give users a quick way to see what tasks have been assigned to them, when 
they are due, and whether the task is on schedule. The My Tasks tab provides users 
with a choice of which tasks they prefer to view. Clicking on the selection boxes 
above the tasks will change the tasks shown. Clicking the pencil icon to the left of a 
task will open the edit screen for that task. 
Filter the tasks
Clicking any of the select boxes above the tasks list on the My Tasks 
tab will filter the task view. Multiple boxes can be selected. The boxes 
shown to the right of each task do not have a function on this screen.

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
The round dots to the left of the pencil icon are used to flag or "pin" tasks. This is a 
way for users to visually mark the tasks. A link to the log for each task is listed next, 
along with completed percentage under the Progress heading. Tasks and Projects 
are listed by their name. Each is a link to view that specific task or project. The Start 
Date, Duration, Finish Date, and hours Due In are displayed next. To the extreme 
right is a checkbox that updates task on the Task List screen. It is not used on the My 
Tasks tab.
The My Gantt tab displays tasks in a visual format independent of projects. Users 
can view their tasks and the tasks assigned to other users in the form of a graphical 
chart with optional choices for dates and other display information. The Gantt charts 
may take a few seconds to load. 
Users may experience a JpGraph font error when clicking on the Todo tab. That is 
what happened to me after I installed dotProject. Fixing this issue can be done by 
those with administrative access and is covered in Appendix B of this book.
Today
The default view when you log in to dotProject is the Day View of the Today 
section, also listed as Today on the user menu. Users can choose from a month view 
and week view as well. ������������
It displays Events and Tasks the user has assigned to them 
in a tabbed menu format. Task progress, title, project title, dates, and duration can be 
viewed at a glance. Users can edit a task, if they have the rights to do so, by clicking 
on the pencil icon next to the task. Task information is highlighted according to the 
color key at the bottom of the task list. The colors are intuitive: green is on-time and 
red is overdue. The color coding is consistent throughout dotProject. 

dotProject User Basics

A three month mini-calendar is available on the right side of the screen, as illustrated 
in the following screenshot:
Main Navigation Bar
The navigation bar usually appears at the top of the screen by default. There are 
dotProject templates and system administration settings that allow this to be changed. 
The menu items covered are those that are turned on for most dotProject installations. 
What do the terms Companies, Projects, ����
and� Tasks mean? As has been stated 
before, dotProject is a Project Management Application. It uses terms specific to 
project management. A company in dotProject is an organization or group. It can be 
a customer, client, vendor, contractor, donor, or any other entity.

Chapter 3
[ 47 ]
Changing Company
If the word Company is awkward for your group, it can be changed 
using a hack proposed by Karen, a dotProject administrator on the 
dotProject community forums. We will discuss changing the company by 
hacking the Translation Management module in Chapter 6 of this book. 
The term Project in dotProject refers to a group of scheduled work being performed 
in a series of steps with a defined long term goal. Saving money for the down 
payment on a house is a long term goal that can be broken down into smaller tasks, 
such as set up direct deposit for savings account, create a budget, and so on.
Tasks are Parents too
Tasks in dotProject can have smaller "child" tasks. The "parent" task is 
usually a milestone (defined date or goal); the child task is an important 
step towards completing the parent task. 
Tasks in project management are smaller portions of work that when combined 
together make up a project. Tasks can be projects themselves if the overall project is 
large enough. Writing a book can be both a task and a project. The book can be a task 
as part of a larger project to provide documentation for a product. The steps needed 
to plan, write, edit, and print the book are tasks.
As with all other areas of dotProject, what the user can do depends upon 
the permissions set up by their system administrator. 
Companies
The Companies link on the main navigation menu will take you to the Companies 
screen. The user will see the companies they have permission to see. This is 
especially important to know if you have a customer who has access to dotProject. 
The customer will see their company only listed. The All Companies tab is chosen 
by default. Users can view the company name, number of projects, and company 
type at a glance. Companies are shown according to the user's access rights. A user 
can search����������������������������������������������������������������������
, filter by owner, add a new company, or view companies based on what 
type they have been categorized as by clicking on different tabs. We will discuss the 
tabs in detail in the next chapter. 

dotProject User Basics
[ 48 ]
The following screenshot gives a view of what the Companies screen will look like:
Projects
Clicking on the Projects link in the main navigation menu will take you to the 
Projects screen. The projects are organized by status into tabs. The All Projects list 
will be chosen by default. 
Clicking on a Status tab will show you only the project(s) with the same status. The 
projects shown can be filtered by Company/Division using the drop-down list on 
the right side of the screen.

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
What's your Status?
Status in dotProject is the state of the project. Just like water goes 
through a cycle of different physical states of solid, liquid, or gas, a 
project has a status life cycle composed of states such as planning, 
proposed, and complete.
New projects can be created from the Projects screen by clicking on the new project 
button on the right. Online help is available by using the icon on the right. Below 
the projects list is the Update projects status button. By checking one or multiple 
projects in their selection row, a project or group of projects can be quickly updated. 
Tasks
The Tasks link goes to the Tasks screen. Tasks is a more generalized screen than 
Today or Todo. It shows tasks assigned to different users with filters and submenus. 
The screen displays tasks by user. Notice the search box to the right of the screen 
heading. Different users can be selected with the user drop-down list. The Company 
drop-down list is set to All Companies by default. The Task Filter is set to 
unfinished tasks by default.
Below the Tasks heading is a submenu. It will display individual user lists, inactive 
tasks, and tasks per user. Clicking on a submenu link will cause a new screen to 
display. The filters will not be available on the submenu screens.

dotProject User Basics
[ 50 ]
The Reports button below the task list goes to a Project Reports screen. Users 
can choose from a variety of reports to run. These will be covered in more detail in 
Chapter 4.
A Gantt chart is also available by clicking the Gantt Chart button. The following 
screen shows the type of Gantt chart that will be displayed. 
Files
The Files repository is displayed when the Files link is chosen. The Files screen also 
uses a tabbed menu. Users can choose from a list of All files, Unknown, Document, 
and Application (see the screenshot in the following page). 
Most common file types such as spreadsheets, documents, images, code snippets, 
and text files can be uploaded into dotProject. These include the following file 
formats: xl, csv, pdf, doc, txt, png, jpg, gif, and php. Compressed files can also be 
uploaded when file size is a concern. Files that are compressed will not be available 
for preview in the browser window. Users can preview most file types in a browser 
window, check a file out to revise or review the content by downloading it to their 
computer, and search for files. Files that are downloaded must be checked back in 
before they can be checked out by other users. The disk symbol next to each file 
listing changes according to whether a file is checked out. 

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
Check it out, check it in
When I first started using the file repository, I had no idea that 
downloading a document prevented anyone else from editing it, 
until the project manager called me and wanted to know why the file 
had been checked out for over a week. 
The Files repository is discussed in detail in Chapter 7 of this book.
Contacts
The full Contacts screen is shown when the Contacts link is clicked. All ��������������
contacts that� 
the user has rights to see will be displayed as seen in the screenshot overleaf.
Contacts can be Private
Contacts created by the user can be set to private on the Edit Contact 
screen by selecting the checkbox next to the Private 
Entry field.

dotProject User Basics
[ 52 ]
The filter is set to "All" by default. Contacts can be viewed by an alphabet link-list or 
searched for. Users can edit the contact list as long as they have edit rights. Clicking 
on the Edit link next to a Contact will open up the Edit Contact screen. Using the 
Edit Contact screen is covered in Chapter 7 of this book. 
Summary
This chapter covered how to navigate to different areas within dotProject, and 
what navigation options are available to most users. We have highlighted the two 
main navigation systems, the main navigation menu and the user menu, and have 
explored deeper. 
The Help menu is available from any screen using the Help link on the user menu, 
the life preserver icon, or the Help link on the main navigation menu. The user menu 
can be accessed from any dotProject screen and it has information based on user 
permissions. The rights to the menu items are reserved based on the user permission 
rights. The main navigation menu contains a series of links leading to different 
sections of dotProject.
In the next chapter we will probe further into each tab. Now that we have covered 
where to go, we are ready to get things done.

Getting Things Done
We want to make progress and achieve results by getting things done. dotProject 
gives users a central place to share and manage all project-related information. No 
more wondering if Ken in Marketing got a copy of the latest project tasks. �����������
Most users 
will find this chapter helpful in their day-to-day use of dotProject.
Chapter 4 will cover setting-up and maintaining the Companies, Contacts, Projects, 
and File areas of dotProject from a user perspective. We will look at examples 
based on real-world situations in project planning and maintenance. Remember, 
project management is a big topic, so in-depth project planning is beyond the scope 
of this book.
This chapter will include:
Managing Companies in dotProject
Managing Contacts 
Managing Projects and Tasks
The dotProject File Repository
Time-saving tips
The sections in this chapter are divided on a functional basis, so the user can quickly 
find the information needed. Most of the forms used by dotProject are easy to use, 
but there are some quirks and some special areas that we will discuss in detail. 
Managing Companies
Why list companies first? It turns out that in dotProject, you must have at least one 
company in order to create projects. External companies should be added if they 
are related to projects. This makes it easier for the users to know whom to contact. 
Departments, Files, Users, and other information can all be managed from the 
individual view Companies screen. First we need to make sure we have a company 
added before we add any projects related to it.

Why the term "Companies"?
Why not use a more generic term such as group or organization? 
The original developers of dotProjects are business people 
themselves. dotProject's initial audience was businesses looking for 
an open-source project management solution. We will walk through 
a hack to change the phrase "Companies" to a more flexible term in 
Chapter 6. 
When we visit the Companies page of the ProjectsRUs dotProject installation, notice 
a list of companies has already been added. Search and the Owner filter dropdown 
allow the user to further control what companies are listed on the screen.
The ProjectsRUs company is listed under the All Companies tab and the Internal tab. 

Chapter 4
[ 55 ]
dotProject installations do not contain any companies by default. The first company 
added is the internal company. The Companies screen just after installation is shown 
in the following screenshot:
Adding New Companies
New companies are added by clicking on the new company button located on the 
right side of the Companies list screen. When the new company button is clicked, an 
Add Company form will appear as shown in the screenshot overleaf. 
Which comes first—The Contact or the Company?
Contacts can be added without any Companies listed in a 
dotProject installation. Companies can be added without any 
Contacts also. The best practice is to create the basic company, add 
contacts to the contacts list, then edit the company information as 
needed. This way each contact will be tied to a company. 
Only the name of the company is required. Filling most of the form is simple data 
entry. Type in the URL of the company's website if one exists. It can then be tested by 
clicking on the test link next to the form field. The Company Owner field will show 
a drop-down list of people already entered into the dotProject contact list. If the 
company owner or contact person is not already listed, you may want to add them to 
the Contacts list. Click on the submit button to finish the process.

[ 56 ]
Although the Company Owner dropdown does not have a "none" 
option, if no name is actively chosen from the dropdown before 
clicking the submit button, the Company Owner field will be blank.
Viewing Companies
Individual companies can be viewed by clicking on their listing in the companies list 
on the main Companies page or by clicking on the tab (name of the tab as defined 
under Type tab) adjacent to the All Companies tab. Company Type is an optional 
way to identify different types of companies in dotProject. 

Chapter 4
[ 57 ]
To view ProjectsRUs, �����������������������������������
 either click the name on the main Companies list or click the 
Internal tab and then the company name. 
Internal Companies
An internal company is usually the organization or group who 
has installed dotProject. A company can have multiple additional 
branches or companies within itself. These should all be given the 
Internal dotProject company type.

Getting Things Done
[ 58 ]
The View Company page has many options. 
Links to the company list and edit this company are directly below the 
page title.
New companies can be created using the new company button on the right.
The details section gives basic company information that was entered when 
the company was created. 
The description section gives an optional paragraph about the company.
Below the box with company information is a series of navigational tabs: 
Active Projects, Archived Projects, Departments, Users, Contacts, and Files. 
View Company Tabs
The tabbed section of the View Company page allows users to manage information 
tied to the company from one central area. The break down of what each tab does is 
as follows: 
Active Projects: Shows a list of all active projects related to the company. 
This is a quick way to see what active projects are associated with the 
company, without having to visit the projects area. 
Archived Projects: List of all archived projects of the company are shown on 
this tab. It is another way for managers and project workers to view project 
information related to a specific company.
Departments: Lists all departments and allows new departments to be 
created in the company.
Users: Lists all users assigned to the company. Detailed user information can 
be viewed by clicking on the user name. 
Contacts: Lists the name and email address of all contacts that are part of the 
company. New contacts can also be added.
Files: Lists all files associated with the company. Files can be attached to 
all projects or a specific project. It is recommended that you already have a 
project and task set up before attaching files. 
Updating Companies
Information about Companies does not stay the same. Phone numbers change, new 
departments are added, and companies move. The information changes over time. 
dotProject provides a form-based screen for updating information about individual 
companies at any time. The Edit This Company screen can be accessed from the 
View Company screen in dotProject.

We are going to walk through updating a company step by step. The ProjectsRUs 
company needs to be updated. There are no departments. Other information should 
be added as well, to better organize the internal contacts. 
Preparing to Edit
To edit the ProjectsRUs company:
1.	 First click on the company name on the Internal tab if you are not already on 
the View Company screen.
2.	 The View Company screen will appear. Different information can be edited 
depending on what links or tabs are chosen. 
What can be edited?
All general company information, including the company name.
Departments can be created.
Contacts can be added.
Files can be attached.
The step-by-step examples will be organized by topic. The section Updating General 
Company Information will cover the different fields of information that can be 
updated, as well as tips on the form itself. We will cover what to do when a company 
has no departments listed in the Adding a New Department section. Managing contacts 
will be discussed after adding departments. Files will be covered later on in the File 
Management and Version Control section of this chapter. 
Updating General Company Information
Choose the edit this company link under the page title. The Edit Company screen 
contains the same form as the Add Companies screen. Refer to the Adding New 
Companies section earlier in this chapter for step-by-step instructions on making 
changes to company information.

Adding a New Department 
New departments are easy to add to dotProject. The only required field is the 
department name. If departments are being organized in a hierarchy, add the 
highest-level departments first, then the ones below them. Be sure to select the 
Department Parent for departments lower on the hierarchy.
1.	 Click on the Departments tab below the details box. Choose the new 
department button on the right. 
2.	 The Edit Department screen will appear. The companies list or the 
individual company can be returned to by clicking on the links below the 
Edit Department title. 
3.	 Type the name of the new department into the Department Name field. This 
field cannot be left blank. In the example opposite, Project Management has 
been typed into the field.

Chapter 4
[ 61 ]
4.	 Enter the rest of the department information in the fields if it is available. If 
there is no more information to enter, click the submit button at the bottom 
left corner of the screen. 
5.	 The Department Parent dropdown allows the user to make the new 
department a sub-department of another department.
6.	 The Owner field is where the manager or person responsible for the 
department can be chosen if one exists on the user list.
7.	 The last field gives the user the option to enter a description of 
the department.
8.	 Clicking on the submit button will return the user to the Departments tab on 
the View Company page.
Each new department will appear on the departments list under the Departments 
tab. To edit a department, click the notepad and pencil symbol to the right of the 
department name on the list. The Edit Department screen is exactly the same 
as before. The department name and all other fields can be altered. To view a 
department, click on the department name. The View Department screen will 
appear with a similar format to the View Company page. The only tab below the 
details area will be the Contacts tab.

Managing Contacts
Contacts can be internal, such as employees, or external such as clients, vendors, 
and contractors. Maintaining the contact list is an important part of successfully 
using dotProject. Assigning tasks and notifying others on the project team is easier 
if an accurate list is maintained. The administrator or head of the project managers 
usually maintains this list, though most of the time users have access to add more 
contacts. The actual rights you will have will vary depending on those granted to 
you by the administrator. 
The entire contacts list can be downloaded as a .csv file. The file can 
then be opened in a spreadsheet program or used for other purposes. 
Importing a .csv file may be available as an option in future releases.
vCards can be imported one card at a time. This can speed up the process 
of including detailed contact information. vCards are contact information 
of individuals stored in an email or address book program. Think of them 
as virtual business cards.
Downloading Contacts as a CSV
The dotProject Contacts module provides a time-saving way to store and manipulate 
contact information. User contact files can be downloaded in CSV format and 
saved as a spreadsheet. This data can then be added to a database, imported into 
another application, or kept as a backup file, or added to an existing spreadsheet, 
or document. 

Chapter 4
[ 63 ]
CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, a phrase that refers to the way each data 
item is separated from other data by commas. We will download a CSV and view it 
in Microsoft Excel as a spreadsheet. 
1.	 Click on the CSV Download link on the main Contacts screen.
2.	 A dialog box will appear prompting you to choose whether to open the file 
or save it to disk.

[ 64 ]
3.	 Click on the OK button to save the file.
4.	 When the download is complete, open the file. It will be automatically saved 
to display in your default spreadsheet program. The downloaded file as it 
appears saved on a computer desktop is shown in the following screenshot. 
Note the lowercase "a" followed by a comma that shows the file format.
5.	 View the file. Notice it displays the contact information in a structured 
spreadsheet format. 
Adding New Contacts
New contacts can be added from many screens in dotProject, wherever there is a 
Contacts tab or link. This makes adding a new contact easier for users. We will go 
directly to the Contacts screen in dotProject using the main navigation bar. 
The Contacts screen shows all public contacts and the user's private contacts. Links to

1.	 Click the new contact button to the right of the search box and you will see 
the Add Contact form as shown in the following screenshot. 
2.	 Type in a first name, and then a last name in the fields marked. These are 
required fields. If you leave either of them blank and click the submit button, 
an error message will appear.

3.	 When all the contact information is entered, click the submit button.� 
Adding a Contact as a vCard
Users who have taken the time to store contact information in an address book will 
want to save time by uploading their contacts as vCards. The actual process will vary 
depending upon the address book or email program used. We will upload a vCard 
from Microsoft Outlook in this example.
1.	 Click on the Import vCard link on the main Contacts screen. The Import 
vCard screen will appear.

2.	 Click on the Browse button to locate a .vcf file on your computer. When 
vCards are saved, they should be in .vcf format. 
Click Open to load the file location into the import screen.
3.	 The path to the vCard file has now been added. Click on the submit button 
to complete the import. 

Chapter 4

4.	 The Contacts screen will display a success message. The contact has been 
added to the lower section of the contact list. Notice that the name is the 
same as another contact. Multiple contacts with the same name can be added 
with no conflict.
Save contacts as vCards
You can also save dotProject contacts as vCards by clicking on the (vCard) 
link next to their name on the Contacts screen.

[ 69 ]
Managing Projects
This is the central purpose of the dotProject application. Projects can be created with 
many details and optional field entries, or with the bare minimum of information. 
This section will cover the best practices for creating and editing projects. Tasks are 
smaller projects that fit under the umbrella of a project. Tasks are usually extremely 
focused on one goal, such as creating documentation for the new version of a product.
The projects view on the Projects screen can be altered in three different ways:
1.	 Sorting the projects list by Color, Company, Project Name, etc. by clicking 
on a title header under the sort by tab.
2.	 Selecting one of the nine project status tabs.
3.	 Filtering by Company/Division using the drop-down list above the tabs.
Keep to the Color Code
Projects can be given unique color codes when edited or upon creation. 
Color coding makes project identification easier. Projects that are part of 
a particular grouping or a much larger company goal, or for any other 
logical reason can all be given the same color code. Sorting the project 
list by color will then display all the projects with the same color code 
in sequence. The color code can be edited by the system administrator 
in the System Lookup Values area. This will be covered in Chapter 5 of 
this book.

in the project row under the Selection heading, choosing the new status from the 
drop‑down menu below it, and clicking on the Update projects status button to the 
left of the drop‑down menu. 
Adding and Editing Projects
Projects can be added from the main projects list or when viewing a company. We 
are going to create a new internal project for ProjectsRUs.
1.	 Click on the new project button and the New Project screen will appear. 
The only required fields are the Company, Priority, Short Name, Color 
Identifier, Project Type, and Status. All other fields, including the Project 
Name are optional. It is best practice to include a unique project name.
2.	 Each project should have a unique name. We are adding a project, titled 
"Intranet". We could also have given it other titles like "PRU Intranet" or 
"Company Intranet Initiative", or "Intranet 2.0". The first twelve characters of 
the name entered will automatically be used to create a short name, which 
acts as a nick-name for the project. 
3.	 The project priority can be normal, low, or high. The default is normal. 
Choosing high will cause a special arrow symbol to show in the "P" column 
of the listed project. The actual options can be changed by the system

administrator in the System Admin section. Priorities are system wide, and 
cannot be personalized to an individual company or project.
4.	 The Company must already have been added to the company list to appear 
in the drop‑down list. 
5.	 The Start Date is chosen by clicking on the calendar icon. A new window 
will pop up. Clicking on a date will add it to the date field and return to the 
New Project screen. The Target Finish Date is chosen the same way.
6.	 Color Identifier shows the color code in hexadecimal format. Users familiar 
with HTML will recognize the default color FFFFFF ������������������������
as white. The color can 
be changed by clicking on the color box next to the change color link. A 
color box will appear. The best practice is to use the pre-set colors defined by 
the system administrator. Users can also choose from the Color Selector by 
clicking on a color. An alternative method is to enter a different hexadecimal 
code in the Color Identifier box manually on the Add Project screen.
A hexadecimal color code is a set of six hexadecimal characters 
(numbers and letters) that each represent a unique color. White 
is always #ffffff. Black is always #000000. The color code 
indicates to the Internet browser or application what color should 
be displayed. The actual appearance of the color may vary slightly 
depending upon the user's screen, browser, or operating system.

7.	 The Status drop‑down box is the main way that projects are organized. A 
project's status represents its place in the project life cycle. The status chosen 
determines how the project is sorted in the Projects list. The options are In 
Planning, Proposed, In Progress, On Hold, Complete, Template, and Not 
Defined. The status chosen will sort the project under a tab of the same name 
on the Projects screen.
8.	 Import Tasks From: Tasks can be imported from another project, reducing 
repetitive work when projects share some of the same set of tasks. 
9.	 URL is a text field where the IP address or website of a project can be added.
10.	 The Staging URL is the test site for a project, if any exists.
11.	 Description: Enter a brief text description of the project goals or purpose.
12.	 Click on the submit button once all the new project information has 
been entered.
Best Practices for Creating Projects
The best practices for creating projects will help us to work swiftly and save time; we 
will cover the art of creating projects in a few steps:
Use a unique project name. 
Have your contacts and the associated company already entered 
into dotProject.
Short Name will suggest a short name. It can be altered by typing in the 
text field.
Click on the change color link or the color box next to it to choose a unique 
color for your project or group of projects. It is useful to set up a color scheme 
for projects that are part of a larger company objective or goal.
If you already have a list of standard tasks in a project, you can copy them to 
another project to use the same tasks again.
View the project before adding a new task to avoid duplication. 
dotProject does not require unique project names. This can 
cause duplication unless the project team agrees to use unique 
names for projects.

Adding and Editing Tasks
A project needs tasks to make it effective. Tasks are key units of work. They are 
often classified as milestones or smaller goals on a project timeline. If this book 
was defined as a project, then the first draft of each chapter could be broken down 
as a task. The actual decision of how exactly to break a project into tasks can be 
complicated, but a general rule of thumb is to take a time-sensitive and functional 
approach. Projects can usually be broken down into a series of steps that lead to the 
goal and completion of the project.
Adding and editing tasks is done on the same screen, using the same structure as 
with the Companies and Departments screens. Tasks can be edited by viewing a 
task and then choosing the edit this task link. Adding a task is usually done from the 
Project where the new task is needed. 
The project "Intranet" needs tasks added. The following example will show how to 
fill out the different task areas easily and efficiently. There are many tabs: Details, 
Dates, Dependencies, and Human Resources. Each tab has unique functions 
that define the task in greater detail. It can be overwhelming to a new user. The 
complexity has the advantage of giving users better control and focus on the actual 
progress of their project. 
Basic Task Creation
The procedure for creating a Task is as follows:
1.	 Task Name: Enter the Task Name in the text box. This is a required field. Be 
clear and descriptive, so the title will make sense on a list.
2.	 Status: Select a status from the drop‑down menu. The choices are active or 
inactive. Unchecking the Active select box will set the overall status of the 
task to Archived and place it under the Tasks (inactive) tab. The task will 
not automatically display on a user's Todo or Today task lists if it is inactive. 
Users will have to choose to display inactive tasks by selecting the Show: 
Archived Projects checkbox on the Todo or Today screen.
3.	 Priority: Determine the Priority of the task: high, low, or normal. The default 
is normal. Normal and high priority tasks will display automatically on the 
assigned user's Todo and Today task lists. High priority tasks have a red 
arrow in the P column. If a task is low priority, it will not display on the 
user's Todo and Today task lists unless the user checks the Low Priority 
Tasks select box to show them.

[ 74 ]
4.	 Percentage Complete: The progress of the task is a drop‑down list that 
allows the user to display the percentage of work already done. If the task 
is already in progress, go ahead and estimate how close it is to completion. 
Changing the percentage will affect the overall calculation of the project's 
completion status.
5.	 Project Milestone: Is the task a project milestone? Some project management 
teams only want tasks that are project milestones documented. Whether all 
tasks are included is an issue to be decided on within your project team.
6.	 The Dates tab: The next important information to include is a valid end date. 
Scroll down if you need to and click on the Dates tab. The dates section will 
appear in a blue box below the tabs. 
7.	 Select a finish date: There are two ways to select a finish date. The first 
method is more precise. Click on the small calendar square next to the Finish 
Date field to choose a valid end date. A monthly view calendar will appear.
8.	 Click the date or navigate to the month needed using the arrows by the 
month title. The date must be on or after the start date. We will learn more 
about Dates tab in the following section.
9.	 Early Submit: If you are done, and do not want to enter any more 
information, click on the save button as shown in the following screenshot. 
The progress and duration information displayed may be inaccurate.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
Task Dates Tab
We need to add more information, so let's continue:
Duration: To select the duration of the task, type in the number of hours or 
days the task is expected to take. It is also possible to let dotProject calculate 
the duration or finish date for you.
To calculate the duration automatically, make sure to have the finish date 
chosen and click on the Calculate Duration button. 
Working Hours: If the daily working hours are different for your team, you 
can adjust them on the Dates section as well. The date format and range of 
time is controlled by the system administrator.

Task Details Tab
The Task Owner, related departments, and other basic information are 
defined here. The active user who created the task is selected as the task 
owner by default. 
Task Type: Task Type choices are limited to Administrative, Operative, or 
Unknown. The default status is Unknown.
Access: The task creator can restrict access to the task. The choices are Public, 
Protected, Participant, or Private. 
Public tasks will be viewable to all users who have access to the project.
Protected tasks are viewable to users assigned to the task or for those in 
the same company as the task owner. 
Participants are defined as those assigned to the task. If participant access 
is selected, only users assigned to the task can view the task.
Private tasks are viewable only by the task owner. 
A Web Address or URL for a task can be entered if appropriate. 
Task Parent: Some tasks in more complex projects are sub-tasks. Tasks can 
be arranged in a hierarchy by choosing task parents. 
Target Budget: If a budget has been set for the task, the amount can be 
entered here.
Description: A brief text description of the task can be entered. This will be 
viewable from the main page of the task.
The dotProject developers have stated that dependencies are still a work 
in progress. They work best in situations where all tasks have a start and 
finish date assigned.
Task Dependencies Tab
Dependency Tracking is off by default. Turn Dependency Tracking on only 
if it is needed.
The Dynamic Task option is used when there are child tasks that will refer 
to the current task as a parent. The parent task will then derive its start date, 
finish date, and duration time from the child tasks.

Do not track this task: Clicking on this checkbox will remove it from the set 
of dependencies, even if the other dependency settings are on.
Set task start date based on dependency: Checking this box will cause the 
start date to be recalculated based on the tasks before it. Leaving this checkbox 
empty means the start date will be recalculated only when the task before it is 
marked as completed and the end date is reset as part of the task log.
Make a task dependent: Tasks can be selected from the All Tasks box by 
clicking on the task box and using the arrow keys below the boxes to move a 
task to the Task Dependencies box. 
Task Human Resources Tab
The Human Resources tab lists the available users on the left in a box by the same 
name. The task creator is listed in the Assigned to Task box on the right by default. 
Notice the percentage is listed as 100%. To change this, select the task creator 
name and click on the left arrow below the boxes to return the user to the Human 
Resources box. Unfortunately, this is the easiest way to have control over the 
percentage of work on a task the user will perform. 
1.	 To assign a user to a task, select the user name, the percentage, then click on 
the right arrow.
2.	 A brief email message can be added to send to all users. 
3.	 The notify assigned users of task by email checkbox is selected by default. 
Uncheck the box if you do not want the assigned users to be emailed about 
the task.
4.	 If the task has not already been saved, click on the save button. The task can 
be edited at a later time as needed.
Task Logs
Task logs are brief updates about the progress of a task. They are a quick way for 
everyone on the project team and task assignees to track the activity within a task.
File Management and Version Control
dotProject uses a sophisticated and often confusing version control system for files. 
Many different file types can be stored in the File repository, including images, PDF 
documents, snippets of code, and Microsoft Office documents. The confusion usually 
occurs during the document checkin/checkout process.

Adding New Files
Files are associated with tasks and projects in dotProject. The Files screen allows 
the user to filter the files list by project, as well as view all files, Unknown file 
types, Documents, and Applications. The color code of each project is prominently 
displayed in the files list. The pencil and notepad symbol takes the user directly to 
the Edit File screen. The floppy disk icon with an orange arrow means the file is 
available for checkout. 
File Repository Terms
The following terms are commonly used when managing files in dotProject:
Checkin: Uploading a revised file to the dotProject file repository. 
Checkout: Downloading a file for review or revision.

add files. 
1.	 Go to the Files screen and click on the new file button. The Add File screen 
will be displayed.
2.	 The default file version is 1. This will dynamically increase each time the file 
is checked out and back in.

9.	 Click on the submit button to finalize adding the file. 
Viewing Files
Project workers and managers may want to view files associated with a project or 
task as part of their work. Files in the dotProject file repository can be viewed in an 
Internet browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Users are able to look at the file 
contents of documents, but not edit them. This is a quick way to preview or examine 
a file without going through the process of checking out the file. ������������������
To view a file in 
your Internet browser, click on the file name. When we click on the ent_logo.png 
file name on the File repository list, it opens the file in the browser window as shown 
in following screenshot: 

Getting Things Done
[ 82 ]
Here we see the original logo of Enthusiastic Entrepreneurs. 
Images and text files will display in a browser window, even if they are categorized 
as unknown. 
To download the file on the local system, right-click on the file and choose "Save 
as…". Spreadsheets and most other documents will give you the choice to open them 
or save them. This will not check the file out. The best practice is to check the file out 
using the process described later in Editing Files. 
Updating Current Files
One thing project managers can count on is change. Project tasks change, people 
involved in projects change, and project information changes. Project workers and 
users with non-admin rights can add and update files. If you are not able to update 
a file, and it is part of your responsibility, contact your administrator to have your 
permissions updated. Files can be checked out or edited in dotProject.
File Checkout/Checkin
First we will explore the Checkout/Checkin process.
1.	 To update a current file, check it out by clicking on the file checkout symbol. 
2.	 The Checkout screen will appear. Make a brief note about why the file is 
being checked out, then click on the submit button.

Chapter 4
[ 83 ]
3.	 The file will be downloaded to your computer. 
4.	 Make any changes needed to the file.
5.	 Upload the file by clicking on the checked out symbol. It will appear as a 
square floppy disk with an arrow on top as seen in the following screenshot:
6.	 When checking the file back in, you must type in a brief text description.
7.	 Browse for the file on your computer.
8.	 If this is the final version of the file, check the Final Version checkbox. You 
cannot check the file out again once it is marked as the final version as shown 
in the following screenshot: 
9.	 Click on the submit button to check the file back in. Other users will not 
be able to view the file until you have done this.

[ 84 ]
Even if no changes are physically made to the file, you must at 
least have the Minor Revision radio button selected. Be sure to 
briefly note if no changes were made. 
Editing Files
Checking out files is not the same as editing files in dotProject. Checkout limits users 
to editing the file content, updating the version number, changing the category, 
description, and task. Files cannot be deleted during checkout. Editing files in 
dotProject gives the user access to change settings related to the file itself. We can 
perform many different actions on the edit screen, including changing the version 
number, category, project, task, description, and even deleting the file. The best 
practice is to limit user's access to the Edit File screen using permissions as discussed 
in Chapter 5.

Let's try this out for ourselves. We will change the task and upload a new file to 
replace the ent_logo.png file.

Summary
We learned in this chapter how to really get things done with dotProject. We created, 
edited, and managed companies, contacts, projects, and files. We learned there are 
many ways to view dotProject information, including filters, sorting, and searches. 
We discovered projects can be created from almost any main page within dotProject. 
Creating a task was the most complicated process, involving multiple sub-screens 
and careful thinking about the details of the task.
This chapter covered the modules a user is most likely to use daily with dotProject. If 
you want to find out more about a particular module, Chapter 7 covers each standard 
module in more detail. In Chapter 5, we will discuss dotProject administration. 

Administering dotProject
dotProject uses a highly centralized administration system. Except for the database 
connection information, all other areas of dotProject are controlled from system 
administration and user preferences. This grants the administrator greater control 
over the dotProject environment. 
Administrators have granular control over permissions, modules, and the dotProject 
system as a whole. This flexibility allows administrators to mold dotProject into a 
project management application that suits their needs. 
We will examine all the main areas of system administration within dotProject. The 
ProjectsRUs installation will be modified by using different tools within the system 
administration interface of dotProject. The actual settings used by administrators will 
vary depending upon the situation. We will focus on the main uses and issues that 
users experience when administering dotProject. 
This chapter will include:
System configuration
LDAP authentication
User administration
Setting and managing permissions
System Administration
There are four main areas under System Administration: 
Language Support: This ���������
contains Translation Management, an 
administrative tool to manage strings and controls which are language 
specific. For example, system administrators can change the control 
Employee to Associate in the English translation.

Administering dotProject
[ 88 ]
In dotProject Strings are phrases of text; Controls are phrases that 
name or describe actions in dotProject. 
Preferences is the main system configuration area. It includes default user 
preferences, custom fields, and overall system settings.
Modules is an administration panel where module activity is controlled. 
Modules can be installed, made active, disabled, and managed in other 
logical ways.
Administration: User Roles and Contacts can be managed here. There is a 
special tool in place for the import of contacts from LDAP.
Language Support
The Language Support area of System Administration in dotProject contains the 
Translation Management application. Translation Management not only allows 
administrators to customize text phrases for translation purposes, but is also the place 
to change the labels applied to dotProject modules such as the Companies module.

Chapter 5
[ 89 ]
There are many languages that can be used with dotProject. The default installation 
of dotProject available usually contains only the English language pack. dotProject 
language packs can be downloaded directly from the dotProject site at: 
http://www.dotproject.net/index.php?name=CmodsDownload.
dotProject refers to languages and language variations as Locales. An 
example of this is the differences between American English, British 
English, and Australian English. Each of these languages has its own set 
of grammar rules and turns of phrase.
Adding a Language to dotProject
dotProject is installed with English as the default language. In a multi-lingual 
workplace, or in situations where a different language is preferred, an additional 
language pack needs to be added. Let's download a language pack to get a better 
idea of how the process works.
1.	 From the homepage of the dotProject site click on the Language Packs 
link on the far top right. You will be able to choose from over twenty-five 
languages. Scroll down until you see French listed. Click on the language 
name to view the download choices.

Administering dotProject
[ 90 ]
2.	 Clicking on French will take us to a choice of several different downloads. 
French Translation - 2.x compatible is the first one on the list. Click the title 
to begin the download. 
3.	 Selecting the most recent one will open up a download dialog box that will 
give an option to save it to the system. 
4.	 The zipped language pack will be downloaded to your computer. Unzip 
the folder to view the contents. The language pack should include a folder 
named according to ISO689-2 language standards containing the language 
files and installation instructions in that language.
A list of the two-letter language abbreviations that adhere to the ISO689-2 
standards can be viewed and downloaded from the United States Library 
of Congress: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/
code_list.php.

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
5.	 If the language pack does not contain a folder using the two-letter language 
abbreviation, create a new folder under the locales directory of your 
dotProject installation. 
Example: To create a directory for a French language pack I would create a 
folder named fr and upload it to the locales directory: 
yourwebteam/locales/fr/
6.	 Upload the contents of the language pack to the locales directory of your 
dotProject installation. If the language folder is already labeled with the two 
letter ISO689-2 standard abbreviation, upload that folder into the locales 
folder. Otherwise, upload the contents of the language folder to the properly 
labeled folder you created in step five. The following screenshot shows the 
FTP directories:
Don't upload the language pack folder
Uploading the language pack folder that contains the language-file folder 
will prevent the language pack from working properly. Language pack 
folders usually have descriptive names such as fra_locales_2001.
What's in the language folder? Let's take a look. When we open up the fr folder 
in Windows XP, each default module and all popular modules have their own 
translation files. 

Administering dotProject
[ 92 ]
The files found in the fr folder are displayed as shown in the screenshot below:
Locales and Lang Required
A locales.php file must exist in the uploaded language folder for each 
language. If your language folder does not contain a locales.php file, 
copy the locales.php file from the /en/ folder. Also a lang.php file is 
required in the folder. If you don't find the lang.php file in the fr folder 
then you can copy it from the /en/ folder and the syntax of the php file 
would be almost the same except for some minor changes as demonstrated 
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
Setting Language Preferences
After a language pack folder has been uploaded to the dotProject installation, the 
language can be chosen by users or administrators in the Edit User Preferences 
screen. The System Administration screen for editing user preferences is shown in 
the following screenshot:
Why System-wide or Individual User Preferences for Locales?
dotProject gives administrators the ability to set a language as default 
system wide or to let individual users choose their own language. Beware 
that setting the language at the system level does not guarantee that users 
will automatically see the new language appear as the default if the users 
were created before the language was set by the administrator.
Now that the language files have been uploaded to the dotProject installation, the 
language will need to be set as the default, if it is to be the primary language.
1.	 Log out of dotProject and log in again as an administrator.
2.	 Navigate to Edit User Preferences under Preferences on the System 
Administration screen.
3.	 Select a language from Locale dropdown in Edit User Preferences.

Administering dotProject
[ 94 ]
4.	 Log out of dotProject then log in—you should see the language already 
applied to the login screen.
5.	 Once logged in, if the language does not appear to have been applied to the 
rest of the installation, the individual user preferences have to be re-set.  
6.	 Click on the My Info link at the top right of the dotProject screen to navigate 
to the View User screen.
7.	 Click the Edit User Preferences link. 

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
8.	 Change the language in the Locale dropdown.
9.	 Log out of dotProject then log back in.
10.	 Now changes should be visible as shown in the following screenshot�.

Administering dotProject
[ 96 ]
To set the new language as the system default, change the Host 
Locale variable in the System Configuration screen under System 
Administration. This will be covered in the System Configuration section. 
Translation Management
The Translation Management screen allows administrators to edit the text strings 
of most of the titles and messages found in dotProject. After the language pack files 
have been uploaded under the Locales directory of your dotProject installation, 
you are ready to begin editing. This is an optional task and is not required for the 
translations to work within dotProject. 
Make sure the permission properties for the language files in the FTP 
directory of the language folder are set so dotProject can write to the 
files. The files can temporarily be set from 644 to 777 if you receive the 
following error message: 
1.	  Click on the Translation Management link under the Language Support 
section of the System Configuration screen. The Translation Management 
screen will appear. The administrative module information is listed 
by default.

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
2.	 To select a different language, use the dropdown on the upper right. When 
French is selected from the Language dropdown, as shown in the previous 
screenshot, the Translation Management screen will refresh with an updated 
String column containing the French language strings. 
3.	 Click the submit button to save the French translation.
Editing Module Text Strings in Translation Management
The text strings for different languages may not be precise translations, or they may 
not fit your company's current terminology. The text strings for individual modules 
can be edited for more consistency and customization.
1.	 Choose the module you wish to edit using the Module filter dropdown on 
the right side of the screen. 
2.	 The screen will refresh and show just the information for that module. 
3.	 Make any edits as needed. Click the submit button when the String phrases 
of a module have been edited. 
User Preferences determines which language is displayed to a user 
by default. If you are receiving errors and have properly loaded 
the php include files for the language under the locales directory of 
your dotProject installation, check the dotProject support forum for 
additional information about bugs or other issues. 

Administering dotProject
[ 98 ]
If you do not see a language you are looking for, why not volunteer to help translate? 
The language packs are translated by volunteers. You can also help improve the 
language packs by reporting any translation errors you find in dotProject. Additional 
language packs are also available for download from sourceforge.net at http://
sf.net/projects/dotproject/ and http://sf.net/projects/dotmods/.
Preferences
The Preferences section of the System Administration screen contains choices 
that configure the core technical features of dotProject. Changing certain values or 
configurations in this part of the environment can be very risky. Be sure to take a 
back up before altering any critical configuration settings.
Backing Up: The dotProject database and the installation folders should 
be saved before any critical or major changes are made. Detailed 
instructions on back-up procedures are in Appendix A of this book.
System Configuration
The System Configuration screen is where the core settings of dotProject can be 
altered. In most cases administrators need not change these settings. Before making 
any changes, review the variable options and have a backup plan in case of any 
problems. You will notice that the developers of dotProject take up a full paragraph 
of the screen explaining the danger of altering values carelessly. 

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
There are quite a few items on the screen to discuss. We will examine each one 
and discuss best practices for system configuration of dotProject. The following 
screenshot shows the system configuration variables that are viewable without 
scrolling. Notice that each variable field has a question mark link in parenthesis to 
the right. The (?) links to a help pop-up menu that describes what each field is for. 
General Settings
The general settings for system configuration are as follows.
Host Locale
The default host locale is English, shown as variable en in the variable field. This 
sets the default locale in User Preferences and resets the default language for all 
new users added after it is set. Instead of administrators or users having to select 
the preferred default language by scrolling the drop-down list, it will appear at 
the top of the Locales drop‑down list and already be set for all new users without 
administrators having to specify the language in User Preferences.
The ISO 689-2 standard for two letter language identification standards must be used 
for any variable entered. Even though you can type other words into the field such 
as "French", they will not work properly. The variable must be the same language 
identification code as the locale/language installed under the locales directory in 
your dotProject installation; in this case it would be fr for French.
To change the default locale, delete the current variable and replace it with a value 
from the drop-down list. To view changes we need to log in to dotProject again. The 
changes can be viewed in Edit User Preference screen under the Preferences section 
in System Administration.

Administering dotProject
[ 100 ]
The new selection made will be the default language. Users created before the locale 
was changed will have the previous language (in this case English) as their default.
Overallocation Checking
The Overallocation Checking checkbox will allow administrators to control 
the maximum percentage a worker can be assigned to a project. This function is 
currently incomplete. 
Currency Symbol
If currency is not displaying properly even after localization has been applied 
(displaying British Pounds symbol instead of American Dollars for example), the 
currency symbol can be set system wide by entering the appropriate variable. 
HTML entities are a series of special characters that if used properly 
and consistently display symbols commonly used in the presentation of 
mathematics, languages, and other specialized information.
A currency symbol must be entered to represent different forms of currency. The 
suggestion next to the Currency Symbol field in the help pop-up will not work. At 
this time currency symbols cannot be represented in the Currency Symbol text field 
using HTML entities. For example, to display the Euro currency symbol, copy and 
paste it into the Currency Symbol text field and click on the submit button. 
dotProject HTML issue
The Euro symbol (€) will not display correctly if we enter its HTML code 
(&#8364;). Instead, dotProject will attempt to display the information as 
it is typed into the text box. It does not convert it from HTML code into a 
useful symbol.

Default User Interface Style
The Default User Interface Style sets the look of dotProject system wide. What we 
usually think of as website templates or themes are referred to in dotProject as User 
Interface Styles. This setting works the same as the Host Locale settings. Users who 
are already created in dotProject will not be affected by the change. 
Unfortunately, instead of a drop-down menu of available themes, the administrator 
must type the User Interface Style into the text field. Once again, changing the name 
of the User Interface Style here will not result in a visual change for current users. 
The style will show up as the default choice on all User Preferences screens.
If you want to change the User Interface Style shown, navigate to the Edit User 
Preferences screen, copy the name of the style exactly, and then paste it into the text 
field. Click on the submit button to finalize the change. We will cover the application 
of this setting in more detail in Chapter 6, when we customize the look of dotProject. 
Company Name
The Company Name field sets the name that appears on the login screen when users 
log in to dotProject. Any short phrase can be entered here and then applied instantly 
system wide by clicking the submit button. 
Page Title
The text that appears at the top of the browser window and in the header area of the 
dotProject installation is edited here. The text entered in the Page Title text field will 
appear in the dotProject header just below the main navigation area and the site title 
at the top of the browser window will immediately change.
Site Domain
The value in the Site Domain text field is set to the dotProject installation by default. 
Its purpose is to form a correct email address if a user's email address was incomplete.
Email Prefix
The characters in the Email Prefix field will be sent as the first phrase in the subject 
of any email sent out through dotProject. 
Admin Username
The Admin Username preference is not used to change the primary dotProject 
administrator. Instead, it is used to propose a dotProject user as an administrator 
of dotProject. I tried to see how this would be used and even after research and 
experimentation it is not clear what purpose this really serves. 

Administering dotProject
[ 102 ]
Minimum Username Length
This preference sets the minimum length for usernames in dotProject. It is a best 
practice to create usernames that contain at least four characters. 
Minimum Password Length
The minimum password length field controls the minimum length required for 
user passwords. It is also a best practice to create passwords that contain at least 
four characters.
Enable Gantt Charts
Gantt charts can be enabled or disabled system wide by selecting or not selecting the 
checkbox and clicking the submit button. 
JpGraph Locale
The JpGraph Locale should be left blank. It is not necessary to specify the path to 
the locale. 
Log Changes
The Log Changes checkbox should be selected if the administrator wants changes 
automatically added to the History log. This may take up extra database and 
system resources. The choice of whether to do this depends upon the needs and 
any business requirements related to the collection of such information. Most 
organizations should be able to keep this box unchecked by default. 
Check Task Dates
When the Check Task Dates checkbox is selected, users must always enter a start 
and end date for tasks when they are created.
Translation Warning
Selecting the Translation Warning checkbox will cause warnings to appear if 
a phrase in the dotProject installation has not been automatically translated. I 
recommend setting this only on test or development installations, not in production 
environments. It should be used for testing and debugging purposes only.
Translation Alert String
Sets the default warning text for Translation errors. This string can be a single 
character or a short phrase. It will be added to any text that has not been properly 
converted during the automatic translation process.

[ 103 ]
Daily Working Hours
The average number of hours in a working day for project management purposes 
can be set in the Daily Working Hours text field. It should be formatted as a decimal, 
such as 8.0 or 9.5.
Show Debug Messages
The Show Debug Messages setting should only be selected in testing or 
development environments. It should not be turned on if the Debug Level described 
below is set to higher than one.
As we scroll down the System Configuration screen, we see many other items 
to configure. The following screenshot shows the configuration items we will 
discuss next: 
  
Allow Ticket Relinking
This setting is used only if the TicketSmith module is activated. It allows tickets in 
TicketSmith to be re-linked to a parent ticket. 
Show All Task Assignees
Set this option on if you wish to show all assignee names in the project task list or 
switch it off, if you would prefer to see just the main assignee name and a count in 
brackets of the number of other assignees.

Administering dotProject
[ 104 ]
Edit Multiple Task Assignments
Turning this option on will allow you to edit task assignments and other options (per 
task block) in the main Task Module view.
Restrict Project Colour Selection
The Restrict Project Colour Selection checkbox is used to limit project workers to 
selecting only the preset colors for their projects. This is ideal for when users are not 
adhering to guidelines for project colors. When users create or edit a project, they 
will be unable to select from the full color palette.
Show MiniCals in Day View
Three month miniature calendars will always appear on the right side of the Day 
View screen, if this option is checked. It is selected by default. 
Calendar Start Hour
Similar to the Daily Working Hours, the Calendar Start Hour field requires a 
positive integer such as 6 or 22 to set the start time for each calendar day. 
Calendar End Hour
The Calendar End Hour should be a positive integer between 0 and 23.
Calendar Minute Increment
The amount of time in minutes to show as blocks of time on the calendar. 
Calendar Working Days
Lists the number of weekdays that are considered working days. Lists the required 
working days in a comma separated list where 0 is Sunday. The default is 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5. Users who have a longer or shorter weekday schedule can modify it by typing the 
correct sequence of numbers in the text field. 
Restrict Task Time Editing
Check this box to prevent project workers who are not project or task owners from 
changing the task time. 
Default Module
The Calendar module is the default module that displays when users log in 
to dotProject. To change the module that users first see when they log in, type 
the exact name of the module, all in lower case. Most modules do not have a 
default sub-module that can be used. Leave the Default Submodule field blank 
in those cases. 

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
After making the changes click the submit button and log out. The new default 
module will be in effect the next time a user logs in. 
Default Submodule
The Default Submodule is the ����������������������������������������������
day view ��������������������������������������
 submodule of the calendar view. If a 
submodule is not available for a module, this field should be left blank. 
Default Tabbed Subview
This setting is supposed to enable a personalized start page. I can't find any 
documentation and have uncovered no practical application of this in my research. 
The best practice is to keep this value set to 1. 
Maximum File Size for Indexing
This variable is set to -1 by default, which will allow all files of all sizes to be indexed. 
Unless there is a situation where file size is a concern, I recommend leaving this 
value at its default setting. 
Debug Level
The debug level can be set to an integer value of 0 to 10. It can be very helpful in 
testing. Setting the value to 0 will display no debug messages. The complete range 
of messages will be available if the debug level is set to ������������������������������
10����������������������������
, but this can cause severe 
performance issues. The recommended level for normal use is 1.
Default File Indexing Parser, MS Word Indexing Parser, 
HTML File Indexing Parser
Each of the above items usually have their variable path set to the same location 
of usr/bin/strings. This path variable tells the dotProject code where to look to 
process the files. 
PDF Indexing Parser 
The PDF indexing parser variable also is a path to the location of a parser. dotProject 
looks in the specified path for information on converting PDF documents to text 
for indexing. 

Administering dotProject
[ 106 ]
Preserve File Settings on CI
This setting is selected by default. It provides an extra measure of security by 
preventing users from changing the file name, project, and file type an uploaded file 
has on check in.
Allow Editing of Previous Versions
This variable is also related to the Files module. It restricts users from editing 
previous versions of files if it is checked. 
Memory Limit for Gantt
The memory limit is set to "8M" (8 Megabytes) by default. If there are problems 
displaying the Gantt charts, set this to a higher value such as "64M" or "128M". The 
Gantt charts should then appear properly.
User Authentication Settings
User Authentication Settings consists of the user authentication method and 
PostNuke standard login, which are explained next.
User Authentication Method 
There are different ways to authenticate users in dotProject. The three choices 
available without adding additional integration modules are Standard dotProject, 
PostNuke, and LDAP. 
PostNuke Login Also Allows Standard Login
Administrators who also use the PostNuke content management system can select 
this checkbox to allow users to log in to dotProject separately from PostNuke.
PostNuke Authentication
dotProject can be set up to authenticate against the PostNuke databases, which 
is very handy for those who are already using PostNuke. A special module, 
dplink, will need to be installed. �����
 The dplink module is available from within the 
[dotproject installation root]/misc/postnuke/ subfolder. It is also available 
from a developer Cas Nuy's site: http://www.nuy.info/downloads/index.php?di
r=Developments%20by%20CMS/DotProject/Postnuke/.

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
It allows administrators to control dotProject authentication in the PostNuke 
environment. It is for versions of dotProject 2.0 and above. A side benefit of the 
module is administrators can leverage an HTTP authentication system as well. 
You must be an administrator of PostNuke in order to fully set up the dPLink 
module. Those of you who are very comfortable with adding new modules to 
PostNuke can go ahead and transfer a copy of dPLink to your modules directory in 
PostNuke and install it normally. The rest of us will need to take it one step at a time. 
1.	 Copy the dplink folder from the /misc/postnuke/ subfolder in your 
dotProject installation. The files are included in dotProject versions 2.0.1 and 
above. There should also be a readme file included in the PostNuke folder. It 
contains instructions from the creator of the module.
2.	 Upload the dplink folder to the modules folder of your PostNuke 
installation.
3.	 Log in to dotProject as an administrator and navigate to the System 
Configuration settings from within the System Admin module. Select 
PostNuke as the User Authentication Method.
4.	 Log in to PostNuke as the administrator. Go to Modules administration 
and click the regenerate link. Scroll down to the dplink listing and choose 
initialize, then activate.

Administering dotProject
[ 108 ]
5.	 Go back to the main PostNuke administration screen. The dPLink icon 
should be there. Click on the link and go to the admin area of dPLink. 
6.	 Type the full URL of the dotProject installation. Using http:// will ensure 
that PostNuke will not choose attempt to use a relative link instead.

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
7.	 Go to Blocks under the Administration menu of PostNuke. Select edit by the 
menu block. Add a menu link with the exact URL of {dplink}. The bracketed 
text is a way PostNuke links to modules internally. The {dplink} will be 
parsed by PostNuke and the actual link will be automatically created for you. 
It is important at this point to determine how you want users to continue to 
log in to dotProject. If you want them to still be able to log in to dotProject 
outside of PostNuke, go to the System Configuration screen and check the 
box by Postnuke login also allows Standard Login.
8. 	 Log in to dotProject as an administrator and navigate to the System 
Configuration settings from within the System Admin module. Select 
postnuke as the login_authenication method.
LDAP Settings
LDAP Authentication
Versions of dotProject 2.0 and greater allow administrators to 
set up LDAP authentication instead of using the default SQL 
database authentication. 
Special variables in the System Configuration screen as shown in the previous 
screenshot several pages back, must be set in order for LDAP authentication to 
work properly with dotProject. 

Administering dotProject
[ 110 ]
A list of each variable followed by brief description is below:
auth_method—Must be set to ldap on the LDAP server in order for 
dotProject users to be authenticated. 
ldap_host—Should be set to the hostname or IP address of the LDAP Server 
to be contacted for authentication of users. The default setting is localhost. 
ldap_port—The port number of the LDAP service. The default (port 389) is 
appropriate for most configurations where there is no concern about possible 
security breaches related to using the default port.
ldap_version—The version of LDAP being used should be set here. The 
correct version will depend upon which directory system is being used. 
LDAP Version 3 is the default support version for OpenLDAP. The version 
might have to be changed to integrate properly with the directory system 
being used. If you receive a protocol error, change the version number. The 
default is 3, which should work in most cases. 
ldap_base_dn—This setting will be different for different LDAP 
installations. It searches for users of dotProject. The LDAP bind 
authentication process also uses this variable. 
ldap_user_filter—LDAP entries are found by using this filter. Like many 
of the other variables the actual setting relies upon which LDAP installation 
is being used. The default filter works under the assumption that each 
user will have a posixAccount object class from the NIS schema (default is 
(uid=NaV)). The string NaV should be used to indicate where the username 
parameter should be applied. In some cases when the default string does not 
work, the string (uid=%USERNAME%) may work instead.
ldap_search_user—This variable represents the Full DN of the user the 
administrator wants to bind as for searching purposes. Make sure the user 
chosen has permission to search the users directory. 
DN is the acronym for Distinguished Name. 
ldap_search_pass—The search user password is represented here.
ldap_allow_login (Allow standard logins)—It is recommended that 
this setting be used so that SQL users as well as those in the LDAP system 
can log in. 
LDAP users will be able to log in to dotProject after the system configuration 
variables are properly set. Users are given the default role of "Anonymous" 
by the system. Administrators will need to alter permissions for users in the 
User Admin module. Roles or customized access can be set.

To learn more about LDAP, consult the documentation of your current installation 
or visit http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/quickstart.html for more 
information about how LDAP works. 
The following email configuration settings depend upon whether the administrator 
wants to use the default PHP mail settings or an SMTP server. SMTP stands for 
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Check with your email administrator or Internet 
service provider if you are not sure which settings to use. 
Email Settings
The email settings for dotProject consists of email transport and SMTP settings.
Email Transport
Select PHP Default or SMTP, depending on whether there is an SMTP server 
available to transport and process the email. 
SMTP Host 
When using PHP Default this should be set to localhost. It should contain the host 
name of the SMTP server if using SMTP.
SMTP Port
The standard port used for SMTP is 25. This is the default setting and will usually 
work fine unless a different port has been reserved by the email administrator. 
Host Requires Login
If your email host requires authentication, this box will need to be selected. 
SMTP Username, SMTP Password 
If host authentication is selected, enter the username and password in their 
respective text fields. These fields are usually left blank. 

Administering dotProject
[ 112 ]
Queue Email for Later Sending 
Mail can be sent later instead of immediately upon creation. The best practice is to 
keep this option unselected. Selecting the option will require setting the Scan Event 
Queue option in Session Handling. 
SMTP Server Timeout 
The variable in the SMTP Server Timeout text field shows the time in seconds 
dotProject will wait before declaring a time-out and stating failure to contact the 
SMTP server. 
Session Handling Settings
This extends the session handling of PHP to beyond browser-based sessions and 
stores the session information in the database. This allows for prolonged sessions 
with lower overheads.
Session Handler 
Administrators can choose from PHP Default or dotProject Extended Sessions for 
their session handling. dotProject Extended Sessions is active by default. It allows 
dotProject to use the database when handling sessions. The best practice is to use 
dotProject Extended Session handling. 
Session Idle Time 
Sessions have a maximum idle time in dotProject. For security purposes, it is a good 
practice to restrict session idle time to no more than 10 hours or the average period 
of time a user is expected to be logged in. Idle time is the amount of time before the 
session is considered to be inactive. Values for this text field are set in seconds but 
can be appended with letters. Only one character can be included in a string. This 
means that while the maximum number of days can be set, the maximum number of 
days and hours cannot. 1d2h is an invalid entry. 26h is a valid entry for the text field. 

Chapter 5
[ 113 ]
The characters used to indicate days, hours, months, and years are as follows: 
h = hours
d = days
m = months
y = years
Session Maximum Lifetime 
The maximum amount of time before a session is ended by the dotProject 
application, no matter what time is set in the Session Idle Time field. The lower the 
number, the better it is. The default is one month. It is a best practice to limit this to 
no longer than one week (7d).
Scan Event Queue on Session Garbage Collection 
This checkbox should be selected if the administrator needs to queue email for 
later sending.
Task Reminder Settings
These are email reminders set for a task.
Send Task Reminders 
Users will be reminded every day that a task is due until the task is completed. This 
is unchecked by default. 
Number of Days Warning for Due Tasks 
The value in this field will determine how many days beforehand a user will be 
reminded of a due task. The default value is 1. 
•
•
•
•

Administering dotProject
[ 114 ]
Maximum Number of Reminders to Send 
The total number of reminders to be sent about a task can be set here. 100 is a large 
number. I recommend setting this value no higher than 25. 
Click the Save button to finish editing the System Preferences. 
Default User Preferences
The Edit User Preferences screen allows administrators to set global preferences 
for users. Think of it as how the user will experience dotProject. You can change the 
User Interface, select a different locale, alter the date and time formats, and more. 
The changes are all fairly intuitive. I will mention again that if a new language pack 
has been added, and you want to now use it as the default, it should be chosen as the 
Locale on the Edit User Preferences screen. 

Chapter 5
[ 115 ]
We will discuss the User Preference items in detail. However, certain tabs �����������
like date, 
time, and currency have been exempted as these are self-explanatory:
Locale: The default language setting for dotProject installations is English 
with a locale of English (Aus). The requisite changes can be made by 
selecting a language from the drop-down list.
Tabbed Box View controls whether all users see tabs, flat links, or either in 
all areas of dotProject that display links as tabs. The Projects list and Task 
submenu below the main content area are examples of modules in dotProject 
that display links with tabs, plain links, or display tabs by default and give 
the user a link to switch to flat list view.
User Task Assignment Maximum sets the maximum percentage of a task a 
user can be assigned to. This can be set for all users here. If users have been 
created after this value is set, they can override it if they have edit access to 
their personal user preferences.
The User Task Assignment Maximum setting controls what percentage of a 
task any user can be assigned. It is useful to change this setting if most project 
workers will not be responsible for 100% of a task. For smaller teams, keeping 
the setting at the default 100% will work just fine. 
Default Event Filter: The event filter has a default setting of My Events on 
installation. Administrators can change the setting to Events created or All 
Events as well. Which filter setting to choose depends upon which makes 
sense for users in the organization.

Administering dotProject
[ 116 ]
Task Notification Method: The Task Notification Method gives the 
administrator the option to have the task/event owner notified along with all 
other task assignees. The default setting is to not include the owner. 
Task Log Preferences: The Task Log Preferences are a series of settings that 
control different features of the Task Log. They may be left as is or leveraged 
to keep a more detailed record of email records related to tasks.
Task Log Email Defaults: The Task Log Email Defaults is a series of three 
checkboxes. They are all unchecked by default. Checking any of the boxes 
causes an email to be sent automatically. Users who do not want an email 
sent when a task is managed will need to uncheck the notify box on the 
individual task.
Email Assignees
Email Task Contacts
Email Project Contacts
Task Log Email Subject: You can include an email subject for task logs 
by typing it into the text field provided. This subject will be included in 
every task email sent out, so it should be generic enough to be appropriate 
for all tasks. 
Task Log Email Recording Method: There are two choices for recording 
email task logs: None, which is the default, and Append to Log. Append to 
Log will make a record of who the email was sent to for a particular task.
Lookup Values
Have you been wondering where to change the names in various drop-down lists 
throughout the dotProject application? System Lookup Values is the place to change 
values for select lists and other system lookup key types. The information listed on 
tabs in the Companies screen (Client, Guest, Supplier, Consultant, Government, 
and Internal) is controlled here. Notice that the values contain a number separated 
from a text phrase. The number values tell the dotProject code the size and order of 
the list the items are put into. Programmers will recognize these as key-value pairs. 
Before any changes are made, the administrator should make sure that the database 
and installation of dotProject have been backed up. Appendix A contains details on 
backing up your dotProject installation. 
Important information about System Lookup Values:
Any changes made could possibly be overwritten by an upgrade to 
dotProject, or by installation of add-on modules.
Changes to any titles must be made also in the PHP code of dotProject. This 
will be done through a find/replace of the code.

Modifying the values must follow a specific 'number|value name' format as seen in 
the following screenshot:
The syntax is n|somevaluename. �����������������������������������������
 It can also be reversed as shown in the 
following example. 
In ColorSelection the Lookup Value controls preset color values for the 
Project colors. They can be changed to fit the organizational structure and 
color preferences. The default values are:

Click the edit �������������������������������������
button when the changes are complete.
Since the changes may not be permanent, it is usually not worth it to change the 
values or titles unless doing so has a definite benefit for the users.
Custom Fields
Need to store company information different from what is provided by default 
in dotProject? Do your projects, tasks, or calendar events require that specialized 
information be collected or shared? Custom Fields give administrators a way to add 
additional form fields to specific areas of dotProject. 
Custom Fields can be added to:
Companies
Projects
Tasks
Calendar Events
Adding a custom field is a simple, six-step process. After the information 
surrounding the purpose of the field has been gathered and approved, the 
administrator goes to the System Administration screen and clicks on the Custom 
field editor link.

Let's add a custom field to the Projects module. Currently, there is no way to know 
if a client has approved overtime, paid for a rush job, or made other special requests 
unless that information has been added to the files or the description. We'll add 
a special form field to notify project workers when special circumstances apply to 
a project. 
1.	 The first step to adding a new field is to navigate to the Custom Field Editor 
from the System Administration screen. When the Custom Field Editor 
screen appears you will see multiple choices for custom fields divided into 
sections by module. Click on the Add a new Custom field to this Module 
under the Projects section.
2.	 In the Custom Fields screen, type in a unique field name in the New Custom 
Field in Projects module. It is important that the name still be descriptive 
enough to identify the new field. The name should be short and use only 
alphanumeric characters. Any spaces or punctuation used will be removed 
by the editor. This field will be hidden from the user. Let's give it the 
descriptive code name CustomScripting.
3.	 Next, type in the Field Description. This text will appear next to the form 
field as a label. We will label this field Custom Scripting.

Administering dotProject
[ 120 ]
4.	 Choose a field display type. Here we are selecting the type of input box we 
want. The process for all but the select list is the same. Select lists will have 
a separate entry field for each item in the drop-down list. We are creating a 
checkbox, so no special item entry field will appear.
5.	 The HTML tag options section is meant to add additional styling using 
HTML. I have found through experimentation that it does not work reliably. 
A better practice is to add tags to the description box or use CSS tags and add 
them to the style sheet in the dotProject installation.
6.	 Click the submit button. 
The custom field has now been added to the Project module. The custom field 
checkbox Custom Scripting will be available on both add and edit forms of 
each project as shown in the following screenshot: 

Chapter 5
[ 121 ]
Custom Field Notes
The new custom field will appear on all Company, Project, and Task screens 
created before the custom field was added.
The custom field will appear in the general section of the Company, Project, 
Tasks, or Event screen. 
As of version 2.0.4, there is not a way to control the location where the 
custom field appears within a module. 
It is also not possible to create a required field using the Custom Field form.
All form widgets created as a custom field will appear on the module edit 
screen or add screens. The actual data will appear as text information under 
the general section of a module's view page.
Billing Code Table
The Billing Code Table is located under Preferences on the System Administration 
screen. Billing Codes are customized flags used to control how project time is 
budgeted. There can be separate billing codes for departments, and types of work 
(administrative, operative, and consulting). The most common method to use is to 
define the codes by department for budgeting purposes. Billing codes are an optional 
feature of dotProject. There is no requirement to use them for projects.

for each field is described:
Billing Code: Alphanumeric phrase that briefly describes the code. 
Value: The amount charged for the service described. This is usually an 
hourly amount.
Description: A full descriptive phrase can be entered here to explain the 
purpose of the billing code. 
Billing codes can be specific to companies. If a company-specific billing code is 
required, first select the company from the drop-down list.

In this example the ProjectsRUs company has been selected. This already has a 
billing code for web content. 
We want to add an additional billing code for our administrative staff. Notice a 
numerical code is now being used instead of a text string for the Billing Code. The 
value is a positive integer, 25, and the description shows what department the billing 
code applies to. 
Once the billing code has been successfully entered by clicking the submit button, 
the screen refreshes to display the new billing code. 
Module Management
Modules are very easy to administer in dotProject. If you have used a content 
management system such as PostNuke before, the process will be very familiar. 
dotProject installations have most standard modules turned on by default. 
Administrators can turn off unnecessary modules, activate disabled modules, and 
install other modules from one interface. Administrators can also determine module 
order from the same screen. 
Installing Modules
dotProject has a group of modules listed in the Modules section of System 
Administration that are not installed by default. This is similar to PostNuke's 
method of handling Modules. Modules that are present in the system, but not yet 
initialized or activated are considered to be in an uninstalled state. We will install the 
Smart Search module to practice module installation. 
1.	 To begin installation, go to the Modules screen under System 
Administration. 
2.	 Click the install link to the right of the module. 
3.	 The SmartSearch module now has a blinking yellow bubble icon with a 
disabled link to the right. Notice that the module can also be removed.

[ 124 ]
If you want to install a module that is not on the list, you will need to upload the 
file to the dotProject installation. There is no method to directly upload module files 
from within the dotProject application itself. 
Activating Modules
Activating modules is a simple process:
1.	 The module is set to active by clicking on the disabled link. The link in the 
Status column will change from disabled to active and the circle 
will change from orange to green. Notice that the module is still hidden. 
Setting the module's status to active makes it available for users in the 
dotProject installation. 

Chapter 5
[ 125 ]
2.	 The Menu Status column indicates whether a module is visible on the main 
navigation menu. A green circle and the word visible means a link to the 
module is listed on the menu. If you see a red circle and the word hidden 
then the module is not shown on the menu. Click on the hidden link under 
Menu Status to make the module visible. It should now appear in the main 
navigation menu as seen in the following screenshot: 

Administering dotProject
[ 126 ]
Re-Ordering Modules
Re-ordering modules in dotProject is as easy as clicking an arrow. Click on the up or 
down arrows to the left of a module name to move it. The module name will show 
up in a different location on the main navigation menu. 
1.	 We want to move the Files module to a new location underneath the 
Companies module. Click the up arrow next to the Files module.
2.	 Click the arrow one more time. The Files module will now be located directly 
beneath the Companies module. 
The Modules can be ordered in any way needed, by use, alphabetically, etc. All the 
standard modules that are active upon dotProject installation will be listed first, then 
disabled modules, and then modules waiting for installation. 
Administering Users
Users are administered in the User Management area within dotProject. The User 
Management screen can be reached by clicking on the User Admin link in the main 
navigation screen. The current users will then be displayed as well as information 
about their activity with dotProject. 
There are several different ways for an administrator to pull up information about a 
user or group of users:
Search for users by typing in a name or value into the search box.
Click the All link next to Show: to display all users.
Click one of the alphabetical links to view all users whose first name, last 
name, or user name begins with a particular letter of the alphabet.

The tabbed content area allows administrators to view Active Users, Inactive 
Users, and User Log. The user log is organized by date. The default date range is 
the current date. Click the submit button to view activity under the current date, or 
follow these steps to specify a date range:
1.	 Click on the User Log tab.
2.	 Click on the small calendar icon next to the Start Date to specify a different 
date to begin the user activity log results. The calendar will appear.
3.	 After a date is selected, the administrator will be returned to the User 
Log screen.
4.	 Follow the same process to alter the End Date as necessary.

5.	 Click the Submit button to view the results. 
Viewing Users
The tabbed content area displays users who can then be sorted by Login History, 
Login Name, Real Name, and Company. The individual user information can also 
be viewed by clicking on the yellow lock icon in the same row as the user listing. The 
View User screen will then appear. Individual user log can then be viewed, as well 
as the permissions and roles for that user. 

Chapter 5
[ 129 ]
Adding Users
Adding users in dotProject requires simply filling out a short form. There are 
additional portions of the user information that will need to be added later to the 
contact portion of the site. 
1.	 To begin, click on the Add User button in the top right portion of the User 
Management screen. The Add User screen will appear. 
2.	 All fields except the Department and Email Signature fields are required. 
3.	 Click the edit contact info link if you want to go ahead and alter the contact 
information for the user as well. 
4.	 Click the submit button when you are done. 
The View User screen will appear once the user has been added. A reminder to add 
permissions and roles for the user is at the top of the screen. 

Administering dotProject
[ 130 ]
Editing Users
dotProject users can be edited by clicking on the notepad and pencil icon on the 
left side of the user listing in the User Management window. The Edit User screen 
is almost exactly like the Add User screen. Notice that the user password now is 
in an encrypted format. The password can still be changed. Type the password in 
the Password field, and then again in the Confirm Password field. Just as on the 
Add User screen, the Department and Email Signature fields are the only ones not 
required. User Preferences can be edited by clicking on the edit preferences link 
underneath the Edit User page title. You can also view the user by clicking on the 
view this user link in the same location. 
Deleting Users
It is very simple to delete users in dotProject, perhaps too simple. Once they are 
deleted, they are gone. dotProject will automatically reflect this change as soon as 
the administrator confirms the deletion. All projects the user was owner on will 
be assigned automatically to another user within the company. The user will be 
deleted from any tasks he or she was assigned to. This can cause confusion and 
disorganization for users. There is not a way to assign a user as a replacement for 
projects and tasks when the other user is deleted. You will also not be prompted to 
assign another user in their place. 

Chapter 5
[ 131 ]
An Alternative to Deleting Users
There is currently no option to disable a user. If you are trying to restrict 
or disallow user access, the best practice is limiting their permissions and 
altering their role. Remember that without a role assigned, a user cannot 
log in to dotProject. 
We are going to delete a user from the YourWebTeam dotProject installation. Marvin 
Starnowkowitz has left the company, so we no longer need to keep his user listing 
in dotProject. 
1.	 The trash can icon to the left of the User name will begin the deletion 
process. Click on the trash can icon to the left of Martin's listing on the User 
Management screen.
2.	 A pop-up window will appear asking you if you want to delete the user. 
3.	 Click the OK button to confirm that the user should be deleted. 
4.	 The User Management screen will reload with a special red triangle and the 
message User Deleted at the top of the screen. The user will no longer be 
listed under User Management, in any of their former projects, or as a contact. 
Setting Permissions
Before getting started with permissions in dotProject, it is important to have a clear 
plan for managing access to dotProject. It is important to consider who will be 
accessing dotProject and what they will need to be able to do. The best practice when 
planning permissions is to set up a chart or grid containing representative users' 
roles, and modules. We will work through several different examples of permissions 
using realistic access situations.
The good news is dotProject comes with several default permission sets for users 
requiring different access levels. It may be that you can get away with using the 
default roles and not have to create any new ones. Understanding how permissions 
work in dotProject will give administrators the freedom to customize the 
environment to match their own needs.

Administering dotProject
[ 132 ]
dotProject uses a permissions system based on the open-source package phpGACL. 
The "php" stands for the programming language used. The GACL is an acronym for 
Generic Access Control List.
Roles
A user must be assigned a role as well as any other permission. Without a role, 
a user will ����������������������������������������������������������������������������
 ���������������������������������������������������������������������������
not be able to log in. dotProject requires the use of roles as part of the 
permissions system. The roles should be determined before most users are added. 
Creating a chart with representative users or groups will help an administrator 
decide what roles need to be created and which default roles from dotProject will 
be used. Administrators may want to use an organization chart or have users sorted 
into functional groups. 
Users
Every user in dotProject must be assigned a role. The user will be inactive until a role 
is assigned. Roles contain default permission sets. Customized permissions can be 
granted to individual users. These should be the exception, not the rule for ease of 
maintenance. Users must first be created in the User Administration section. As you 
will recall, when a user is created dotProject will automatically redirect the creator to 
the View User screen. This is the best time to go ahead and assign roles and add any 
other additional permissions. 
Here we see that Ruth Sharpe has been assigned the role of project worker. To assign 
the role the following steps were taken: 
1.	 Click on the security lock icon next to the user name under the inactive user 
tab in the User Management screen. 
2.	 Click on the Roles tab on the View User screen.
3.	 Select a role from the drop-down list under Add Role.
4.	 Click the add button.
5.	 The role will appear on the right. 
6.	 The user will now be able to log in to dotProject.

Chapter 5
[ 133 ]
Roles are the easiest way to set up user permissions. dotProject comes with four 
roles by default: 
Administrator—Has access to all administrative and non-admin modules.
Anonymous—Can view the navigation menu and various screens, cannot 
see any information such as projects, files, etc. 
Guest—Can view non-admin modules that match their company.
Project Worker—Can view non-admin modules of any company, can add 
new projects and edit projects.
Users can have multiple roles assigned to them. Administrators can also expand 
the Permissions set by the roles. Adding permissions to specific items on the 
Permissions list will grant or deny access. Permissions can be set by individual 
module, all modules, or sets of modules. 
We can get very detailed and make this a very complicated topic; using common 
sense and having a plan in mind when creating and assigning roles and permissions 
will help prevent it from being overwhelming. Thinking about what individual 
users need to do will keep it all in focus. We will explore other examples of roles and 
permissions later in the chapter under Common Permission Setups.

Adding New Roles
Administrators who feel limited by the default dotProject Roles can alter them or 
add their own roles. I recommend not altering the default roles unless they clash 
with the security standards of your organization. Instead, create new roles to 
customize access to your requirements. 
To add a role, navigate to the System Administration area and choose the User 
Roles link under the Administration section. The Roles screen will display with 
options to edit, view, delete, and add roles.
When you are charting out permissions access, if several users require the same type 
of access, a custom role should probably be created for them. 
To ��������������
create ��������
 a role:
1.	 Type in a role ID to represent the role. Let's use "developer" since that is the 
position of the users who will be using this role in the company.
2.	 Type in a Description of the role. This will also be the title of the role. We are 
going to use Developer for our new role description text.
3.	 Click the add button to add the role to the Roles screen.
The role has been added, but no custom permissions have been assigned. It is as if 
we have created the pastry crust for a pie and not yet added the filling. It may seem 
strange that we do not set up the access levels when the role is created, but that is 
how it has been designed. It does give us a chance to reflect on what permissions we 
will be setting for a role. 

Chapter 5
[ 135 ]
The icons on the Roles screen operate a little differently than on other screens. 
Clicking on the notepad icon will take the administrator to a screen to edit the role ID 
and role description. To edit a role, administrators need to click on the security lock 
icon. The deletion is done by clicking on the universal trash can icon. 
So we've created a role and have nothing but a new name to show for it. Let's 
add permissions to the role so it is ready to use. We are creating a new role called 
Developer for our dotProject installation. The developer mainly does coding and 
other development work. They need to be able to view, add, and edit the Projects, 
Tasks, Files, and the Calendar. They will not need the right to delete any modules.
A chart mapping out the modules, access type, and status required has been created 
prior to setting any permission. This is a good way to keep track of specific sets of 
permissions when documenting processes. 
1.	 Click on the security lock icon to bring up the View Role screen. 
2.	 First we will add permissions to the Projects module. Select Projects from 
the module dropdown.
3.	 Set the Access ������������
dropdown ����
 to Allow. Check the Access, View, Add, and Edit 
checkboxes. Click the add button.

Administering dotProject
[ 136 ]
4.	 The Projects permission set will appear on the left side of the screen.
5.	 Repeat the process for the Files, Tasks, Task Log, and Calendar modules.

Chapter 5
[ 137 ]
The Developer Role is now ready to be used for any programmers, or other users, 
whose roles are largely technical without administrative access.
Common Permissions Setups
Here we will explore permission setups that most administrators will need to 
consider when using permissions in dotProject. Don't forget that unless access to a 
module is specified, it is denied by default. dotProject permissions are designed with 
a focus on granting rights instead of taking them away in order to set permissions. 
The only situations where administrators should need to deny access is when they 
are customizing a role at the user level. 
Basic permissions situations include: 
Full access to all modules
Access to administrative modules only
Access to non-administrative modules only
User administration access
Restricted file viewing
Specialized project worker access
We already worked through an example of a restricted project worker role when we 
created a new role called Developer earlier in the roles section of this chapter. Now 
we will take a look at examples of the basic situations most administrators encounter 
when setting up permissions in dotProject. These can be applied at the User Access 
level as permissions or created as specialized roles and then applied. If you know 
that you will use the same set of permissions repeatedly, it will save time to create a 
role for that permissions set.
Full Access to All Modules
ProjectsRUs has hired a new IT manager Ruth Sharpe who wants full access to 
dotProject. We will set up a full access role for her.

Click the add button to add the new permissions set to Ruth Sharpe's user listing. 
The new set of permissions will appear on the left side of the screen directly under 
the Permissions tab. ��������������������������������������������������������������
Ruth will now have full administrative access to all modules. 
Administrative Roles
Sometimes there are users who only need access to the administrative portions of 
dotProject. Email administrators, IT managers, and administrators whose role is to 
maintain and back up the dotProject installation. They do not need to work with the 
projects themselves. We will create a role that will streamline user permission setup 
of administrative users.

Click on User Roles under the Administration section of System Administration.
The Roles screen will appear. To add a new User Role, we will enter text into 
the form fields at the bottom of the screen. Type in a unique role ID such as 
adminmodonly in the text field contained in the Role ID column. Type Admin 
Module Worker in the text field at the bottom of the Description column. Click the

Restricted Administrator: Users Only
Administrators may be further separated by function. Examples of this are the 
administrator who specializes in user administration, administrators who only 
work on System Configuration, or those who work with modules exclusively. The 
following steps show how to set up a restricted administrator in dotProject. We will 
set up a User Administration role. 
1.	 Click on User Roles under the Administration section of the System 
Administration screen as illustrated above under Administrative Roles.
2.	 Type in a unique role ID. We'll use useradmin this time. Type User 
Administrator in the Description field. Click the add button.
3.	 After the Role screen refreshes, click on the view role icon to set the 
permissions for the User Administrator role.

Restricted File Access
It is not always a good idea to allow all users in a company to view files stored in 
the file repository. To restrict file access to users assigned to a particular project, the 
following specialized access can be set up. It does require additional permissions 
masking at the individual user level, so it should be used only when necessary.
1.	 Click on User Roles under the Administration section of System 
Administration.
2.	 Type the unique role ID projectfileobserver. Type Project File Observer in 
the Description field. Click the add button. 
3.	 After the Role screen refreshes, click on the view role icon to set the 
permissions for the Project File Observer role.
Select Projects from the Module dropdown. Leave allow selected on the 
Access dropdown. Check only the Access box. Save the change.

Select Tasks from the Module dropdown. Check only the View box. Save 
the change.
4.	 Select Files from the Module dropdown. Check the Access and View boxes. 
Save the changes. Check only the View box.
Go to User Administration and select a user who needs file access restricted. 
We will use ProjectsRUs employee Ken Vandiver, who is an intern who 
already has his permissions restricted to Non-Admin modules. He will be a 
good example of a user who might need limited access to Files.

8.	 Before we set the user's access to a specific project, we must deny him access 
to other projects. Click on Projects in the Module drop-down list, leave 
Item set to All, set Access to "deny", and select the View, Add, Edit, and 
Delete checkboxes.

11. Finally we need to apply the Project File Observer role we created before 
to our user Ken Vandiver. Click on the Roles tab and select Project File 
Observer from the Roles drop-down list. Click the add button to apply the 
role to the user. 
12.	 The new user role now appears on the left side of the screen under the

Restricted Company Access
A user may require access to projects only listed under a specific company or 
companies. The role created in this example will limit employees of the ProjectRUs 
client Enthusiastic Entrepreneurs to viewing their projects. They will not be able to 
edit or create new projects. This selective setup is relatively easy to do. 
1.	 Click on User Roles under the Administration section of System 
Administration.
2.	 Type the unique role ID companyproject. Type Company Project in the 
Description field. Click the add button.
3.	 After the Role screen refreshes, click on the view role icon to set the 
permissions for the Company Project role. Select Projects from the Module

the add button to save the role. 
7.	 Susan Frances will now be able to view only projects for her company when 
she logs in to dotProject as shown in the following screenshot: 
After assigning a role to a user, the administrator can further customize the user's 
access by going to the individual user's View User page and allowing or denying 
access generally or to specific modules. There are standard permissions setups that 
most organizations find useful. More information about permissions and roles, and 
other sample permissions setups can be found at the dotProject course on Permissions 
for dotProject 2.x at the URL� http://sites.sakienvirotech.com/moodle/.
The permissions course is only ten USD and can be paid online with a PayPal 
account. This is a great way to directly support the creators of dotProject and have 
unlimited access to topical information. The information is well organized and 
written in a way that non-technical users can quickly get up to speed on permissions 
in dotProject.

[ 153 ]
Summary
We discussed many different areas of dotProject administration, including system 
configuration, user administration, setting up companies, and setting permissions. 
dotProject uses a logical process for system configuration where modules can be in 
different states from disabled to active. dotProject's modular framework allows most 
modules to be turned on and off, giving the administrator great flexibility. 
Administering users in dotProject is very simple. The most important point to 
remember is that users must be assigned a role or specialized permissions before 
they will be considered active in dotProject. Permissions in dotProject can be done 
with pre-set roles, or by using a very detailed rights system. Permissions must be 
set for each user of dotProject. Each user should have at least one role assigned to 
them. Users cannot log in to dotProject without a role assigned. dotProject uses a 
permissions philosophy that grants user access on a group or individual basis.
Changing the values in the System Configuration area can cause severe problems in 
the dotProject environment if not done carefully.
In the next chapter we will explore other ways to customize dotProject. We will 
examine themes, using different image icons and other methods of tweaking the look 
and feel of dotProject.


Customizing the 
Look-and-Feel 
I like to think of this chapter as "trick my dotProject". This chapter focuses on the 
presentation layer of dotProject. We will explore different ways to customize the 
looks of dotProject. We will alter icons, change images, customize themes, and do 
other things to personalize the dotProject environment.
This chapter will include:
Customizing themes
Using different icons
Stylesheet editing
Customizing module text strings
By the end of this chapter you will be able to give your dotProject environment a 
look that blends in better with your website or business. 
Setting User Preferences
User Preferences are found under the System Administration screen. We discussed 
them in detail, earlier in Chapter 5. They have the same structure as the personal user 
preferences available to each user. Even though these are global settings, they may 
not apply to current users. Determine and configure these settings before creating 
any additional users if at all possible. Let's take a closer look at the User Interface 
Style themes that can be set for users.

Customizing the Look-and-Feel
[ 156 ]
User Interface Style
dotProject installs with three available interface styles. These control the 
appearance of the tabs, the background colors, and the overall look of the dotProject 
environment. Which one to use is a matter of site requirements and user preference. 
Users can also change the style they see when they log in. I have not yet discovered 
a way to prevent users from changing their style except for blocking their access to 
User Preferences using permissions as shown in Chapter 5.
Users created before the User Interface Style is changed in System 
Administration will not have the new theme instantly applied.
Grey Slimline Style: Shiny, sleek, and silver, this style has a clean, modern 
look that mimics the Apple.com site.

Default Clean Style: A blue and gray interface with minimal images. 
Screenshots of this theme have been used almost throughout this book.
Classic DotProject Style: The original dotProject theme uses a left-hand
menu system which has a mint green background. It has a clunky interface 
compared with the Default Clean style. It may not load properly on all 
installations. The following screenshot gives an overview of what the GUI 
would look like:
Finding Other Themes
There are other themes available to use with dotProject. Mats Djärf is a theme 
creating machine. He has several themes available for free download:

Custom Themes
In this section we will learn how to customize themes to suit our requirements.
Altering an Existing Theme
Altering an existing theme is a great way to become comfortable with the different 
presentation elements in dotProject.
1.	 Download an existing theme you want to alter.
2.	 Copy the theme. Use the original as a backup.
3.	 Rename the copy. Webteam_style is the name given for the YourWebTeam 
theme.
4.	 Make any changes you want. Do you not like the background color? Want to 
replace the dotProject logo with your own? Just want to add your logo? It can 
be done by altering the theme.
5.	 The next sections will include information on changing background colors, 
replacing fonts, and other aspects of customizing a theme. We will end up 
with an altered theme similar to the one shown in the following screenshot. 
It is a version of the WPS-Light theme with the background of the title 
header area and the logo area on the right altered using techniques learned 
in this chapter. 
Is it a Style or a Theme?
Even though the skins or themes of dotProject are referred to as User 
Interface Style in the User Preferences, most people familiar with content 
management systems such as PostNuke are more comfortable with the 
term "Theme". Both the names refer to a centralized group of files that 
change the look-and-feel of dotProject. 
Changing Images
Administrators often want to change the images to match a company style-guide 
or to create a customized look. How difficult it is to do will depend on what images 
need to be changed. Altering the icons of individual modules is a more involved task 
than altering the background behind the title of the entire dotProject environment. 
Altering Icons
Icons are the small images usually stored in the images file of individual module 
folders or in a special icons folder within a dotProject style. The icons can be easily 
downloaded, altered in an image editing program, and then uploaded back to the 
original folder.

Replacing Icons
Mats Djärf has packaged up a slick set of icons labeled Novola ���������������������
for dotProject. This 
is available for download at� www.w8.se/dotProject. The original author David 
Vignoni, also known as the Icon King, has many more icons available at 
www.icon-king.com.
Replacing icons involves a series of careful steps: 
1.	 Download an icons package. They are usually available packaged in tar.gz.
2.	 Unpack the package in a new folder on your computer. Use a program such 
as WinRar.
3.	 Back up the original images folder of the dotProject installation located 
under the root folder of the dotProject installation (such as /public_html/
dotProject installation/images/) and of every module subfolder.
Example: The YourWebTeam dotProject installation is located in a subfolder. 
Its image path is as follows: /public_html/yourwebteam/images/.
The images folders for the modules can be found under each module name in 
the modules subfolder. In the YourWebTeam installation, the images folder 
for the admin module can be found at this path: 
/public_html/yourwebteam/modules/admin/images/.
4.	 Upload the images folder within the icons package to the root of 
the dotProject installation. It should replace the original dotProject 
installation/images/ folder.
A safer image files replacement method
To avoid deleting any other images, select all the image files in 
the new images folder, then drag and drop them to the dotProject 
images folder or select 'upload' using your FTP client to send them 
to the images folder.
5.	 Navigate to the sub folder of each individual module in the core_images/
modules/ folder of the icons package. 
6.	 Upload the images folder of each individual module to the respective images 
subfolder of the module in the dotProject installation under /modules/your 
module/. This should replace the images folder of each module.

7.	 Clear your browser cache and examine the results. 
Replacing the dotProject Logo
The YourWebTeam administrator has been given a logo that is being used on every 
YourWebTeam site. The administrator decides the logo should go in the top right 
corner of the dotProject installation. This will replace the dotProject logo. The larger 
the logo is, the more space the header area will take up. 
1.	 ��������������������������������������������������
Back up the original logo. It can be found in the /dotProject 
installation/theme name/images/ as file dpicon.gif. Note that the size is 
120 by 20 pixels in gif format.
The YourWebTeam dotProject installation has the logo located at the 
following path:/public_html/yourwebteam/style/default/images/.

[ 162 ]
2.	 ������������������������������������������������������������������������������
Crop the new logo to closely match the original size. The larger the logo is, 
the more space the header area will take up. The YourWebTeam logo will 
display without distorting at a size of 120 by 39 pixels.
3.	 �����������������
Save the logo as dp_icon.gif.
4.	 ����������������������������
Upload the new image to the /style/your theme/images/ folder of the 
dotProject installation.
5.	 Refresh the browser and view the results.
Replacing the Header Background
Is the dark blue gradient stripe of the default dotProject theme clashing with your 
company colors? Change the color of the title background in a few easy steps.
1.	 �������������������������������������������������������������������������
Create a new image file in an image editor such as Photoshop, Paint Shop 
Pro, or Gimp. Set the width to 2048 pixels and the height to 2 pixels. You 
can create an image with greater height, as long as you remember to reduce 
the height to 2 pixels later. The file will repeat horizontally in the header 
space once it is uploaded.
2.	 ������������������������������������������������������������������������
Fill the background image with any color or gradient. Save the image as 
titlegrad.jpg in your personal theme folder.
3.	 ����������������������������
Upload the new image to the images folder of your dotProject theme 
(dotProject installation/images/). ����������������������������������������
 Refresh the screen. The new image will 
tile (repeat continuously) behind the dotProject Installation title in the header 
area as in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 163 ]
Easy Header Background
Download the titlegrad.jpg image. Open it in any image 
editing program. Make any cosmetic changes to the image file, 
including changing the color, adding patterns, or a different 
gradient. Save the changes in a new folder, and then upload the file 
to the dotProject installation as described above.
I Don't Want to See an Image There
If you do not want to see an image in a certain area at all, there is a simple hack to 
prevent an actual image from being seen. Any image in dotProject can be "hidden" 
this way. It is a smart idea to download a copy of the original image file and save it 
in case you change your mind later. 
The easiest way:
1.	 Create a transparent background image with the same width and height as 
the original background image. Save it as the same type of file and with the 
same name. 
2.	 Upload it into the image folder of the old image. This will replace the original 
image in the dotProject installation. The original image will no longer be 
visible. The placeholder image will take its place, acting as a clear film.

[ 164 ]
Editing the Style Sheet
dotProject uses style sheets extensively for design markup. Be sure to back up any 
files you want to change. Beware of changing the names of any existing style sheets 
as well. Comment changes you make. It will make things easier a month from now 
when you have forgotten what color the background used to be.
We will explore making changes to the existing styles in the style sheets, and perhaps 
adding a few of our own. If you already have styles from other web projects that you 
think would be a good fit, you can incorporate them into the altered style sheet.
Altering Existing Styles
Before any changes are made, the style sheet should be backed up. Being able to revert 
back to the original style sheet is a real-world necessity. Documenting changes made 
to style sheets is another good practice to use. Weeks or months later when the reasons 
why styles were changed have been forgotten, you will be glad the notes were made.
There are many styles and tags that can be altered in a style sheet. Describing each 
one in detail is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, several basic styles that 
frequently need to be altered will be explored.
Changing Fonts
Does your company use a preferred font? Do the fonts in dotProject need to closely 
match the fonts used on other company sites? Changing the font in the style sheet is a 
simple procedure that will reap big rewards. The default font of the dotProject default 
theme is Osaka. We will be replacing it with a different font in the following steps. 
1.	 Save a backup version of the main.css style sheet. It is located in the theme 
name subfolder of your /styles/ folder of the dotProject installation. For 
example the stylesheet for the default theme of YourWebTeam is located at: 
/public_html/yourwebteam/style/default/main.css.
2.	 Open the style sheet in an editor such as HTML-Kit or even a basic text editor.
3.	 If you are using a Windows PC, click Ctrl + H to activate the find and replace 
function. Type Osaka in the find portion of the window and enter the font 
you want to use in replace. Click the Replace All button. All instances of the 
Osaka font will be replaced with the new font. There are only about thirteen 
occurrences of the font, so they can also be replaced by cutting and pasting. 
4.	 Save the CSS file in a special folder.
5.	 Upload the file to the /styles/theme name/ folder of your dotProject 
installation.

Chapter 6
[ 165 ]
6.	 Refresh the screen to see the change. Lucinda Console has a distinct look 
and is shown in the following screenshot. Any web-safe font such as Arial, 
Georgia, Courier, Trebuchet MS, and Verdana can be used. 
Why use a web-safe font?
Web-safe fonts can be boring, since there are only a few of them to choose 
from. Any font can be used, but be aware that not all users may have the 
font installed on their computers. Fonts such as Tahoma, Calisto MT, and 
Century Gothic are relatively safe alternatives.
Adjusting Links
We will change the color of the default link style and also set its text decoration 
element to underline. The default link style of the default dotProject theme uses a 
dark blue color with a hexadecimal value of 08245b:
1.	 To change the color, begin by opening the main.css style sheet in an editing 
program such as HTML-Kit.
2.	 Go to line number 36 and replace the current hexadecimal code 08245b with 
a new color. We will use#006600 in the following example 006600— a bright 
web-safe green. ��������������������������������������
Change the text decoration value from none to underline.

Customizing the Look-and-Feel
[ 166 ]
   A:link�{
           color: #006600;/*was 08245b*/
           text-decoration: underline;/*was none*/
         }
3.	 Save the CSS file.
4.	 Upload the file to the /style/your theme/ folder of the dotProject 
installation.
5.	 Refresh the browser. The calendar, links under the page title, and many other 
areas are affected by this change. 
Commenting Style Sheets
Style sheets can be commented, and it is a best practice to add comments 
when changes are made, especially in development. The example above 
is commented. The forward slash and asterix symbols '/*' are typed in 
order begin a comment block. The asterix and forward slash symbols '*/' 
in reverse order together indicate the end of a comment block. 
What Styles Should I Leave Alone?
If you have a test installation of dotProject, and you have backed up the style sheets, 
then go ahead and experiment. It is the best way to become comfortable with 
dotProject and CSS. Do not remove any of the required dotProject styles. All the 
original style names should be left in the dotProject main.css stylesheet. Any of the 
information within the styles contained in the brackets '{}'can be changed.
The colors and other attributes such as background colors and margins 
can be altered, but beware that altering margins and other positioning 
elements can cause errors and disrupt the display of modules and 
information. 

Chapter 6
[ 167 ]
Currently I only have a production copy of dotProject (well several production 
copies) running on my web server, so I won't make any changes that cannot be 
fixed by uploading a copy of the backup file. Some of the styles in dotProject control 
the framework of the site itself. It is possible the site will break and strange things 
happen. Sounds fun. Let's try it. 
Changing the Required Body Style
The background color, font, or other styles can easily be changed. A backup copy 
should be set aside in case the altered style sheet needs to be replaced. We will be 
replacing the background of the body tag.
1.	 Open up the main.css style sheet from the copied theme folder.
2.	 The required dotProject body style is located on line number 2 of the main.
css file. The default dotProject body style has a light gray background color. 
Change the background color to a medium purple with the code #cc66cc. 
The bright hue of the color will be easy to see on the screen against the other 
objects in the dotProject environment.
BODY {
       background-color: #cc66cc;/*was #f0f0f0*/
       margin-top: 0px;
       margin-left: 0px;
       margin-right: 0px;
       margin-bottom: 10px;
       font-family: Osaka,verdana,Sans-Serif;
       font-size: 10pt;
     }
3.	 Save the changes in a special folder labeled "altered" or in a new styles folder. 
I like to comment my changes in the CSS code as well to avoid confusion. If 
compression is an issue, save a special uncompressed version with comments 
for editing purposes.
4.	 Upload the changed style sheet and take a look. Wow! Even in black and 
white the change should look dramatic. It is easy to see what portions of 
the dotProject environment are affected by the background color style in 
the body tag. Any color can be used for the background, as long as it is in 
hexadecimal format. 

Customizing the Look-and-Feel
[ 168 ]
Replacing the Background Color with an Image
Images can also be used in the background style. Using a small image will work best. 
The same image is printed recursively on the background of the page. Images ideally 
should be no larger than 16 pixels by 16 pixels. Using larger images can cause display 
problems on the screen, including module information not displaying properly.
1.	 Alter background style in the body tag of the main.css file. We will replace 
the background-color attribute with the more general background attribute 
and add an image element to the background attribute.
Replace the background-color attribute on line number 3:
background-color: #f0f0f0;
With this new background attribute:
   BODY {
          background-image:url(images/ywt_bg.png)
        }
2.	 Make sure the image path is to the images folder of the style. Save and 
upload the altered CSS file.
3.	 Upload the new image into the style/theme name/images/ folder of the 
dotProject installation.

Chapter 6
[ 169 ]
4.	 Refresh the page. This background image is dramatic so the change 
can be easily seen. A more subtle background would be easier on 
everyone's eyesight.
Adding New Styles
New styles can be added to affect the appearance of text, links, and other 
components that control the presentation of dotProject elements. Always back up 
the original style sheet before making any changes. Styles "cascade" in a style sheet, 
meaning if two styles are specified for the same element then style listed last will be 
used. This is important to remember when altering fonts or links in a style sheet. 
Tips for Creating a New Theme
Creating a custom theme can be a difficult process. It is much easier to alter a copy of 
an existing theme. Before creating a custom theme, look at the files of other themes 
such as wps_light and wps_redmond. Make a note of the changes made by the theme 
author compared to the dotProject default theme. 
If the different examples are followed in this chapter, the fundamentals of creating a 
new theme will already be in progress. Altering the icons, colors, fonts, and images 
of dotProject will create a unique look for your own dotProject environment.

Customizing the Look-and-Feel
[ 170 ]
Why am I making such a big issue of this? Creating a new theme or converting a 
dotProject theme to a complete CSS-driven one has several obstacles to overcome. 
There are images and other elements embedded into the code of the dotProject 
environment, making replacing certain colors difficult for theme creators. Theme 
creation can take a great deal of time. dotProject does a good job of using CSS, but 
it does use tables extensively. It may not be possible to have full control of how the 
environment looks without a great deal of effort. 
Customizing Module Text Strings
When is a company not a company? When it is a group, government entity, club, 
or any other organized association of people. It is possible to change the titles, 
labels, messages, and other strings of text in modules to better suit the needs of an 
organization. Karen, an active dotProject developer originally proposed how to do 
this on the dotProject forums. We will walk through how to customize the company 
module as an example.
1.	 Log in to dotProject as an administrator and navigate to the System 
Administration screen. Click on the Translation Management link under 
Language Support.
2.	 The language dropdown should already have English selected. Choose 
common from the Module dropdown. 
3.	 Enter the word Company in the Abbreviation text field and the word Group 
in the English String text field.
Scroll down the list of text strings until the word Company is found. Select 
the checkbox next to the word in delete column. 

Chapter 6
[ 171 ]
4.	 Click the submit button to finalize the change. The screen will refresh with 
the success message Locales file saved and the new English string displayed 
in the English String column.
If there are multiple instances where a word, such as Companies, is combined with 
another string in a text field listing in the English String column, such as Clients & 
Companies, the text string Companies would be deleted from the text field listing 
leaving only the word Clients using the method described above.
To replace English String text field entries that contain more than one word, the 
full phrase must be entered in the Abbreviation field. So Clients & Companies 
would be typed into the Abbreviation field, and Clients & Groups would be typed 
into the English String field in the new entry location. The current text string entry 
would then be found by scrolling down the list and replaced by selecting the delete 
checkbox. Clicking the submit button would finish the process.
It is repetitive, but this must be done for each instance of an English String under the 
common selection of the Module drop-down where a text string such as Companies 
is combined with other words.

Summary
We explored many different ways to customize how dotProject looks. We went from 
using the default themes and settings to a new unique skin with customized settings. 
You can use your own images and icons with most of dotProject. Styles can be edited 
on the default dotProject style sheets to enhance existing themes. Customized looks 
can be created by copying the default folder, renaming it, and making changes to the 
new folder contents. The identifying text strings in modules such as Company can 
be altered and customized. Set default user preferences and customize your theme 
before adding any users. 
The dotProject environment is very malleable. We have learned new ways to 
mold the dotProject environment so it matches our requirements as users and 
administrators. In the next chapter we will extend dotProject even further and learn 
more about dotProject reports and Gantt charts.

Beyond Projects: Charts, 
Reports, and Extensions
There is more to an effective project management application than managing 
projects. Managers rely on charts and reports in dotProject to capture high-level 
views of projects and tasks. Developers use a variety of modules to enhance and 
extend dotProject. We will go beyond projects in this chapter, exploring the charts, 
reports, and additional modules that extend the functionality of dotProject. 
This chapter will include:
Gantt Charts
dotProject Reports
Installing, configuring, and using add-on modules
Do-It-For-Me modifications
Resources for developers
Information about module support and deprecation

More Standard Modules
Standard modules are modules that are present in dotProject by default. We do not 
activate or configure these modules. We will discuss these modules in detail in the 
sections that follow.

Gantt Charts
Gantt Charts are provided as a default module in dotProject using the third-party 
extension JpGraph to process and display the Gantt Charts. There are two types of 
Gantt charts available. The combined view displays all project levels. The Project 
Detail view is accessible from within individual projects. The charts provide a 
visual graph of progression. Administrators occasionally experience errors with 
fonts and locales. These issues are well documented within the dotProject forums 
and on the JpGraph site http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/ by volunteers, users, 
and developers. Most of the solutions will work fine for users who host their own 
installations of dotProject. Users with shared hosting may have additional difficulties 
with configuration. Those issues are covered in Appendix B of this book. 
The Combined Projects View
The ������������������������������������������������������
Combined Projects �������������������������������������
 view is accessed by clicking on the Gantt tab in the Projects 
screen. Users can filter by date, projects shown, and other details. Gantt Charts show 
task progress over time. Making adjustments to the date range will "zoom in" on 
precise segments in the project timeline. 

Chapter 7
[ 175 ]
The Individual Project View
The �����������������������������������������������������������������������
Individual Project view ������������������������������������������������
 is very similar to the combined view. The main 
difference is users can view overall progress at the task level. Task dates, durations, 
and activity for the whole project can be seen at a glance.
The ToDo View—New in Version 2.1.0
The newest version of dotProject released in February 2007 contains an additional 
Gantt ���������������������������
 Chart view for users. The ToDo view in version 2.1.0 includes a ������������
Gantt Chart� 
for users.
Project Reports
The features of the Project Reports module are in a state of transition. The module 
is being updated in stages. What this means for users is that some reports are 
embedded within the code during the transition period.
Overall Report and Overdue report are yet to be fully 
functional. dotProject is still working on it, and we hope to see the 
improvements in the near future.

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 176 ]
Reports are available for every project by clicking on the Reports link on the View 
Project screen. The Project Reports index screen will load and display a list of 
available reports as seen in the following screenshot:
The reports do not all work consistently in version 2.04. The 2.1.0-rc1 version of 
dotProject has fixed several bugs including errors to do with the Allocated User 
Hours report not displaying consistently. As of version 2.04 the Project Reports 
module is not a fully functioning module. 
A variety of reports are currently available on the Project Reports screen. Reports for 
different projects can be run from the Project Reports screen by selecting a project by 
name from the Projects drop-down list. Selecting a new project will cause the screen 
to reload and return to the reports index screen shown above. We will look at two 
very different and useful reports that show how most reports in dotProject can be 
generated and viewed. 

Chapter 7
[ 177 ]
Generating Reports
dotProject Project Reports are typically generated by clicking on the report name 
from the main Project Reports screen and then selecting a date range. Selecting the 
Log All checkbox will generate a report for all projects or tasks of that company, 
depending on the type of report chosen. The report results will appear in a table as 
seen in the screenshot below when the report requires a range of dates to be selected.
Not all reports require that choices be made before generation. The Overdue, 
Upcoming (tasks), and Project Statistics reports automatically generate output. 
While the first two reports create a PDF document to download, the Project Statistics 
generates a report with many distinct areas of information. We will take a closer look 
at it below in the following section.
Viewing Reports
Most of the Project reports display simple tabular results. The report title is usually 
displayed first on a dark background at the top of the table. The results of the report 
are shown in a grid format below the report title. The Project Statistics report 
displays multiple reports on one screen, both tabular and color coded. We will take a 
closer look at the results to learn more about viewing reports in dotProject.
The PDF files for the Overdue and Upcoming reports may not 
display properly when downloaded. This appears to be an issue with 
the PDF generation tool within the dotProject code. 

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 178 ]
The Progress Chart report displayed first shows the percentage of the project 
complete in green, the tasks in progress in blue, and tasks that should have started 
in orange. We can quickly see that over 60% of the project is complete by the large 
rectangle of green. The Time Chart has a disturbingly large rectangle of red. Over 
30% of the tasks in the Ajax Mania project are past due. 
Next a series of tables are displayed that include information on the Current Project 
Status, user task completion information, the number of people on the project team, 
and the file space used in the file repository. The different tables give a higher-level 
picture of how the project is doing when viewed together on one screen. 
Resources
Resources in dotProject refer to furniture, equipment, rooms, and any other type 
of physical entity that may need to be allocated for a task. Resources must first be 
added in the Resource module before they can be associated with a task.

Chapter 7
[ 179 ]
Adding Resources
Resources are added by clicking on the NEW RESOURCE button on the Resources 
screen. They are classified as All Resources, Equipment, Tools, or Venue. The 
only required portion of the Add Resource screen is the name of the resource. 
Administrators may want to restrict access to this module to prevent users from 
clogging the resource list with clerical errors and inaccurate information. 
Forums
The Forums module creates a basic discussion forum for use with individual 
projects. Users can use forums to record discussions, share notes, and distribute 
project news. 

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 180 ]
The forums module can be turned off if not being used by the system administrator 
in the modules area of the System Administration section of dotProject.
Those with access to the Forums module can view all the forums as their permissions 
allow. Forums can be added to a watch list so the user can be notified of any new 
posts or activity. 
Forums for each project are accessible from that project's main screen on the tabbed 
section below the main display area. 
Topics can be added to individual projects. Each topic can be watched for updates. 
Last posts, replies, and the post author are viewable from each forum's main screen. 

Chapter 7
[ 181 ]
Calendar
The Calendar module displays different views depending on how it is accessed. A 
month view is the default view when accessed using the main navigation menu. The 
current day is shown on user login. A week view can be seen when users click on the 
icon of the numeral seven surrounded by a blue square at the beginning of each week. 
The Week view of the Calendar module gives users the option to filter the events 
seen. This reduces clutter when there are many tasks listed. The week and year are 
listed at the top of the view, but not the month. Hopefully future versions of the 
calendar will show the name of the month as well. Users can access the Month view 
underneath the Week view title. The Today view can be reached below the view. 
Each task can be directly reached by clicking on its listing.

SmartSearch
The SmartSearch module allows users to search across all the modules within 
dotProject. Search features within individual modules are limited to their own 
module. This module can be activated within the module management area of the 
System Admin module.
To use SmartSearch on any available screen, type a word or phrase into the text box 
and click the Search button. The results will display once the page refreshes. Each 
active module is listed with links to any results returned from within it. Clicking on 
a result will take the user to a view of the result item. Users will have the option to 
search again as well.

[ 183 ]
Backup
The Backup module is a new feature of dotProject 2.0. It gives administrators 
the option of creating an XML backup of the dotProject database. The files and 
other information of dotProject not stored in the database will not be backed up. 
Administrators should have a regularly scheduled backup system running in 
addition to the use of this module. 
Backups are run from the Backup area within dotProject. The Backup module 
must first be installed before it can be used. Backup is considered to be both a 
standard module and an add-on. It can be downloaded from the dotProject mods on 
SourceForge.net at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_
id=70930.

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 184 ]
To install the Backup module, unzip or un-tar the file then upload it to the modules 
subfolder of the dotProject installation. The module will then need to be installed just 
like all other modules. Once active it will appear on the main navigation menu. At 
this time it is only possible to back up the dotProject database. There is not a way to 
backup individual modules at this time. 
TicketSmith Module
TicketSmith is a depreciated legacy module. It will not be maintained 
past dotProject 3.0. It was originally included in dotProject to provide a 
helpdesk support feature. There are other add-on modules that provide 
the same functionality; we will discuss more about this in the later section 
about TicketSmith.
Add-On Modules
Have you wanted to add a ticketing or issue-tracking system into dotProject? 
Wondered where the risks assessment features were? ������������������������������
The dotProject add-on modules 
are an easy way to extend dotProject to do all those things and more. Most of the 
add-on modules can be found at SourceForge.net at the dotProject mods project. 
Language packs can also be found at the same location: http://sourceforge.net/
projects/dotmods/.

Chapter 7
[ 185 ]
You can also search the Internet for other third-party modules. Before installing a 
module not listed on the SourceForge or dotProject sites, be sure to check the forums 
and see if anyone has posted any issues related to the module. Any third-party 
module is a potential security risk. Read any available documentation carefully. If 
the information is not clear, post on the forums or check the module creator's site for 
additional information.

Installing Add-Ons
dotProject modules can usually all be installed using exactly the same method. 
Be sure to check the readme file of a module before installation for any special 
instructions. 
1.	 After the module is unzipped, upload it to the /modules/ folder of the 
dotProject installation.
2.	 Log in to dotProject and go to the System Administration screen.
3.	 Click on the View Modules link.
4.	 The View Modules screen will appear. The module should now be displayed 
on the modules list. If the module is disabled, click on the disabled link 
to activate it. If the module has a configure link, click on it to make any 
additional changes. To make the module visible on the main navigation 
menu, click the hidden link in the Menu Status column.

Eventum is an enterprise-level ticketing and issue tracking system. The dotProject 
developers created an add-on module that integrates Eventum with dotProject. 
Eventum should be installed before the dotProject module (also known as Eventum) 
is added to your dotProject installation.
Eventum being a very useful feature has been covered in this book. 
However, it will be worth noting that this feature is redundant in 
dotProject 2.0.4 and is applicable in 2.0.1.

Installing the Eventum Module
After the Eventum integration folder has been uploaded to the dotProject 
installation, additional steps need to be taken to configure it to work properly 
in dotProject. 

Chapter 7
[ 189 ]
1.	 Install the module by clicking on the disabled link next to Eventum on the 
modules list.
2.	 Click the configure link and you will see the following screenshot:

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 190 ]
3.	 Type the installation directory into the Eventum Installation Directory 
text field.
4.	 Check Enable Customer Support Levels if the module will be used to help 
track customer issues and tickets.
5.	 A new series of choices will appear if the Enable Customer Support Levels 
checkbox is selected. The Customer Support Grace Period can be set 
by day(s).
6.	 The Defined Support Levels section sets up various levels of response time 
for support issues. Custom levels can be added using the form fields. 
7.	 When configuration is completed click the Apply Changes button.
8.	 A final configuration screen will appear with links to .zip and .tar 
gz compressed versions of the evlink folder. Download the folder, 
then upload it to the Eventum installation and unzip it to complete the 
integration. The files can also be unzipped locally and then uploaded 
according to the folder paths. 
9.	 If the Eventum configuration file is not writable from the dotProject 
installation, a text file to copy and then paste at the end of the Eventum 
config.inc.php file will be displayed as shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 Log out of dotProject and log back in. An Issues tab should appear in the 
ToDo area and in the bottom tab section of individual project screens.

[ 191 ]
Using Eventum
Once Eventum has been successfully installed and the dotProject Eventum module 
has been configured, the combined support contracts system should be ready to use. 
The integration works by sharing dotProject companies and contacts who have a 
support contract defined with the Eventum installation. Projects in Eventum and 
dotProject can be linked to each other individually, but not in a group. Users who 
have a login set up for Eventum that is the same as their dotProject login can view 
issues assigned to them on the Today tab in dotProject. 
Eventum is currently available only for version 2.01 
of dotProject.
Eventum is primarily used for bug tracking and support ticket issues. It provides 
additional functionality to dotProject users who need a ticketing solution. 
Enabling Support Contracts in dotProject
Support contracts can be enabled for each company on the Eventum Support 
Contracts screen. Click on Support Contracts from the main navigation menu. The 
Eventum Support Contracts screen will be displayed as in the following screenshot: 

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 192 ]
Five tab choices are displayed by default: No Contract, Standard, Gold, Platinum, 
and Contract Expired. Until support contracts are added, all companies will be listed 
under the No Contract tab. There is currently no way to assign contracts to multiple 
companies at the same time. 
1.	 To add a support contract to a company, click on the new support contract 
button in the Change column next to the Company Name. The Add/Edit 
Eventum Support Contract screen is shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Select a date range for the company by clicking on the calendar next to each 
date field. Select a contract type from the drop-down list then click the save 
button to apply the support contract to the company. 
Helpdesk
Helpdesk is a ticketing and support desk module. It is recommended as a 
replacement for TicketSmith by the developers of dotProject. There is still a great 
deal of work being done on Helpdesk. It is recommended that users download the 
latest version or individual code patches from the CVS on SourceForge.net, which 
can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_
id=70930. 
To download, click on the HelpDesk link on the page. It will take you to the 
HelpDesk download screen. Choose which compressed file format you prefer 
and click the file name to begin the download—helpdesk_20040507.tar.gz or 
helpdesk_20040507.zip.
If there are problems users can update files from the CVS: http://dotmods.cvs.
sourceforge.net/dotmods/helpdesk/ or visit http://www.packtpub.com/
support, and select this book from the list of titles to download.
Attempting to install the tar.gz version on the main portion of the dotmods project 
will most likely result in a blank content area of the dotProject installation. 

Chapter 7
[ 193 ]
Installation and Configuration
The module should install normally. It can be configured before being activated by 
clicking on the configure link. Make sure that the config.php file is writable before 
making any changes. 
The Helpdesk module is highly configurable. It is a more advanced ticketing tool 
than TicketSmith. Administrators have many choices that tailor the module to suit 
the needs of the users. 

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 194 ]
Using Help Desk
The user view is much cleaner than TicketSmith and has many options of bug 
tracking software such as Bugzilla that users should be familiar with. The types of 
tickets are clearly organized and contain useful icons. The tickets are categorized by 
status, when opened, closed, and if watched on the progress of the solution. New 
items can be added by clicking on the NEW ITEM button.
Clicking the NEW ITEM button will take users to the ADDING HELP DESK ITEM 
screen. Users creating new items have many options to choose from. All required 
fields are clearly marked. Once the ticket has been created, clicking the SUBMIT 
button will return the user to the Help Desk screen.

Chapter 7
[ 195 ]
Invoice
The Invoice module was designed for everyday users to have a way to create 
invoices from within dotProject. Professional accountants may find it lacking 
in features. If you are having trouble with the Invoice module, the latest version 
may need to be installed (invoice_alpha2.tar.gz as of May 2007) from 
SourceForge.net. 
Installing the Invoice module follows the basic installation method given at the 
beginning of this chapter. The Invoice module is designed differently than many 
other dotProject modules. Invoices can only be created from within a project. Users 
are not able to create invoices from the main Invoice screen. Invoices can only be 
sorted and viewed from that location. 
Using Invoice
New invoices can be created from the individual project screens by clicking on the 
new invoice button underneath the Invoice tab. Users will then be taken to a New 
Invoice screen. After filling out the invoice information, clicking the submit button 
will save the invoice.

Beyond Projects: Charts, Reports, and Extensions
[ 196 ]
TicketSmith
TicketSmith is a basic ticketing system which is expected to be replaced by Helpdesk 
in version 3.0 of dotProject. The developers will not be updating TicketSmith for 
versions of dotProject 3.0 and above. If you are going to commit to using dotProject 
for any length of time, Helpdesk is a better investment of time.
TicketSmith installs easily. Upload the unzipped folder to the modules folder of your 
dotProject environment. The module will display as Tickets on the View Modules 
list. Click the update link if necessary and then make the module visible by clicking 
on the hidden link. 
Using TicketSmith
TicketSmith uses a simple form to add issue tickets in a forum style format. 
More details can be set for a ticket after it is created. Tickets do not have to be 
associated with a project, but they can only be assigned to a person who as a 
dotProject user account. 

Chapter 7
[ 197 ]
Internal notes can be added to tickets. They will appear with a blue background in 
their own box below the ticket notes. The actual ticket information is kept separate 
from staff notes. Follow-up information can also be posted. Posting follow-up 
information will automatically email the client.

Custom Modification and Integrations
Short on time or developer resources? Think dotProject would be a great solution 
for your situation if you could just change a particular thing about it? Customized 
modification may be for you. Developers and support resources are available to 
customize dotProject at a price. Customization projects are priced individually 
according to complexity and the developer's rate. 
What are the advantages?
A developer who is experienced with dotProject code 
Specialized programming resources
Quick development time
Another option to having a dotProject-approved developer work on your installation 
is to purchase courses through dotProject for your own developers or consultants. 
The courses were created by key dotProject developers and cover a variety of topics. 
Developer Resources
There are many types of developer resources available for dotProject. Programmers 
can find extensive information about contributing to dotProject on the documentation 
wiki in the Programmer docs section. Information about the framework, module 
creation, CVS access, as well as other in-depth documentation is provided. 
How do I Volunteer?
If you are looking to volunteer with dotProject, there are three key areas where you 
can contribute that may eventually lead to being able to directly contribute to core 
development:
1.	 ��������������������������������������������
Become and active contributor on the forum (http://www.dotproject.net/
vbulletin/).
2.	 ����������������������������������������������
Report bugs and submit patches or suggestions.
3.	 �������������������������������������������
Create a useful module for everyone to use.
4.	 �������������������������������������������
Translate dotProject into another language.
Being listed as a Professional Developer on the dotProject site is limited to 
authorized core developers. Showing commitment to the project as a whole is the 
first step to becoming a trusted contributor.

Chapter 7
[ 199 ]
The dotProject community is international and made up of users from a variety of 
backgrounds and levels of experience. The primary location of community activity is 
the dotProject forum site. No issue is too big or too small to answer. Registering as a 
member of the dotProject forum gives participants access to email notifications when 
threads are updated, different statuses based on posting frequency and helpfulness, 
and free membership in a global community of dotProject users. 
What should I Know?
Developers should be familiar with PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, XHTML 1.1, and 
CSS 2.0. Documentation of changes made and version control is a must. They 
should be willing to follow the basics of code contribution as described in the 
Contribution Basics section of http://docs.dotproject.net. ���������������������
 dotProject is coded 
in a platform-independent methodology. 
If you cannot find a language pack for your particular dialect or language, consider 
translating dotProject and contributing the language pack. 
Summary
Having a basic understanding of their purpose allows users and administrators 
to make informed decisions about what modules are necessary in their dotProject 
environment. 
The twelve core modules can be disabled but not removed. There are four main 
types of modules: Issue Tracking, Project Enhancements, Business Modules, 
and Language Packs. Not all modules will continue to be supported by dotProject 
in version 3.0. Modules such as the Department and Reports are not yet fully 
functional. Third-party tools such as JpGraph enable the dotProject developers 
to spend more time focusing on improving the core modules. A new version of 
dotProject is available as a public beta: 2.1 RC1. It is not ready for production �����
use. 
Review the documentation at http://docs.dotproject.net/index.php/Release_
Notes_-_2.1.0_-_rc1.
In addition to installing ready-made modules, users can hire experienced dotProject 
developers for "Do-It-For-Me" customization and integration. Users can take a 
variety of courses that will show them how to further extend dotProject. Serious 
developers can use the many resources available to delve into the back-end 
functionality of dotProject to make further modifications.
The dotProject team has always been committed to the project functionality of 
dotProject. They continue to focus on improving the core features.


Upgrading dotProject
The core developers regularly update dotProject. If your version of dotProject is 2.03 
or below, upgrading to version 2.04 will make your installation more secure. Version 
2.04 contains a major security patch. The process of upgrading dotProject is usually 
routine. There are several precautions that should always be taken with any upgrade: 
Back up the dotProject database.
Back up the dotProject files.
Review the release notes for the planned upgrade.
Have a rollback plan in place.
Test the upgrade in a development "sandbox" first.
The most recent public version of dotProject is available at:  

http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotproject/
Those who want the very latest stable version can download it from the CVS, which 
is also located at the above URL. 
If you are already using a control-panel-based tool such as Fantastico, you will 
automatically be prompted to upgrade when you visit the Fantastico tool.
Other users will need to upload the new files to their dotProject installation. Always 
download the most recent version possible to avoid conflicts with modules and 
possible security risks.

Backing Up dotProject
Things don't always go according to plan. Natural disasters, hardware failures, and 
other unforeseen circumstances occur. Risk management is a crucial part of any 
project. A dotProject administrator who prefers to manage and minimize potential 
risk takes measures to safeguard data against loss, whether from a planned upgrade 
or a random disaster.
Backing up environment files and database is a best practice, no matter 
what application you use.
The actual process followed to back up files and databases will depend upon what 
system architecture dotProject is installed on. That is a fancy way of saying, if a 
control panel such as cPanel or Plesk is used, then backing up is fairly easy. Both 
the popular control panel environments have applications that do the hard work for 
administrators and have a friendly GUI environment. Advanced administrators can 
use command-line interfaces to create automatic backups. Using a command-line 
interface is beyond the scope of this book. We will instead cover how to back up files 
and databases using cPanel, a popular control-panel environment provided by most 
Internet Service Providers who host domains. 
The screenshot opposite shows the three tools of cPanel we will discuss in this 
appendix: Backups, Cron jobs, and Fantastico.

Appendix A
[ 203 ]

Upgrading dotProject
[ 204 ]
Using cPanel Backups for Easy Manual 
Backups
It is easy to create and restore manual backups of databases and files using the 
Backups tool in cPanel X. No coding or messing with databases or FTP is required. 
The screenshot below shows the Backups tool as it appears in a browser window. 
Clicking on the Download a home directory Backup link under the Home Directory 
heading creates a manual backup of the dotProject installation. Restore the backup 
under the Restore a Home Directory Backup heading by browsing and then 
uploading the backup file.
Manually back up a MySQL database by clicking on the name of the database 
under the Download a MySQL Database Backup heading������
. The Restore a MySQL 
Database area is where a backup copy of a database can be restored by browsing to 
the backup file and then uploading it. 

Appendix A
[ 205 ]
Back Up the dotProject Database 
Automatically with Cron Jobs
Knowing how to back up the dotProject database manually and automatically gives 
administrators flexibility. Even though we can restore the dotProject database using 
the Backup module discussed in Chapter 7, being able to back up a database is a 
crucial administrative skill. It is the same process no matter what application is using 
the database. The fictitious ProjectsRUs company uses MySQL for its dotProject 
database. We will walk through setting up an automatic back up for a MySQL 
database since that is the database most users are likely to use.
1.	 Create a folder for the dotProject backups. It should be just under the /home/
root name/ (the site root) folder on the server, and not in the /public_html/ 
folder. In the following screenshot, a folder for the ProjectsRUs backups 
called dotProject_backups has been created and placed just under the root 
folder of the site. 

Upgrading dotProject
[ 206 ]
Placing any backup file in the public_html folder is a security risk. It is 
much easier for unscrupulous people or malicious Internet bots to snatch 
sensitive database files if they are left in the public_html folder. 
2.	 Log in to cPanel and click on the Cron Jobs icon. It looks like a folder with a 
clock leaning against it. The Cron Jobs experience menu will appear. Click on 
the Standard button to open the Cron Jobs screen. 
The word Cron is a shortened version of the term "chronological". Cron 
Jobs are tasks done within a specified time frame. They are often repeated 
on a regular schedule.
3.	 The Cron Jobs screen will display a form with a text field entry for commands 
as seen on the screenshot on the page opposite. This may look intimidating for 
administrators who have never run a Cron Job before. cPanel environments 
use UNIX terms for Cron Job commands. If you have never used UNIX 
before, don't worry, we will discuss each step in detail. First, enter an email 
address where Cron Jobs can send information about the backup. 

Appendix A
[ 207 ]
4.	 The mysqldump is a special MySQL command to backup databases. We will 
enter a string of text that will tell Cron Job to back up the dotProject database 
every month on Friday mornings at 3 AM. Type the following text into the 
Command to Run text field: 
      mysqldump -user=rumour_dpb3c729 -password=zm5891y rumour_dprj2 | 
      gzip>/home/rumour/dotproject_backups/weekly_backup.sql.gz
What did it all mean? The mysqldump command comes first, followed by -u 
or -user. The username for a database user who has full permissions to the 
database is listed, followed by -p or -password for that user's password. 
The next information entered is the database name. In the example above 
the database name is rumour_dprj2. A pipe symbol separates the database 
name from the gzip function. The gzip function will compress the database 
to reduce bandwidth and storage costs. The final information listed is the 
path and name of the backup file. Notice the file will be created by the gzip 
program and then given the name weekly_backup.sql.gz. It will be stored 
in the dotProject_backups folder we created in step 1. 
5.	 The time settings are next. Each selection will highlight when it is chosen. 
Following the screenshot above, set the Minute(s) to 0, Hour(s) to 3- 3AM, 
Month(s) to Every Month, Day(s) to 7 and Weekdays(s) to Friday for the 
Cron Job. 

Upgrading dotProject
[ 208 ]
6.	 Scroll down and click the Save Crontab button at the bottom of the browser 
window when the set up is complete. The compressed backup file will 
automatically be sent to the backup folder on the scheduled date and time. 
Knowing UNIX is not required to use Cron Jobs. I do recommend that 
you learn more about Cron Jobs if you are new to the tool. ������������������
 Visit the cPanel 
site for more in depth information: http://www.cPanel.net/docs/
cPanel/Cron_jobs.htm.
Backing Up the dotProject Installation Files 
for Automatic Upgrades
cPanel makes it easy to back up files before an automatic upgrade. If it is an upgrade 
suggested by a cPanel tool such as Fantastico, the administrator will be prompted 
on the main Fantastico screen to upgrade the installation when a new version of the 
program is available. All upgrades for programs listed in the Fantastico tool follow 
the same procedure. The current installation can be updated by clicking on the 
'�������������������
Upgrade to…' �������
 link. 
Before clicking the Upgrade button on the Upgrade screen, make sure that copies 
of any modules or modifications added after the installation are available or 
documented. The Upgrade screen will back up the files automatically as part of the 
upgrade process. 
Fantastico will run an upgrade script for the installed program. When the installation 
is complete the screen will refresh with updated information about the upgrade. It is 
important to document the file names and restoration process in case there are any 
problems with the new upgrade.
cPanel also enables administrators to back up their files and directories using the 
Backup tool as described earlier. A third way to backup the installation files is to 
download a copy of the installation using FTP.
Review the Release Notes for the Planned Upgrade
dotProject upgrades usually come with release notes or readme files. If it 
is an automatic upgrade using a control panel such as cPanel, review the 
upgrade notes on the dotProject site before upgrading. Most releases such 
as 2.04, the most recent version, provide important security patches and 
bug fixes.

Appendix A
[ 209 ]
Have a Rollback Plan in Place
The files and database were backed up, the release notes were read, but something 
went wrong. Returning to the way the environment was previously is a time-saving 
method to recover from problems. Before any upgrades are done, plan what should 
happen if there is a critical failure. 
A simple plan might involve:
Backing up the database and files
Deploying the upgrade
Testing the upgrade
Applying any patches, additional files, or other fixes as described in the 
troubleshooting documentation for the upgrade
Rolling back to a previous database and/or set of installation files if there is a 
critical failure
Test the Upgrade in a Development "Sandbox"
A development environment, also often referred to as a sandbox, is a safe way 
to test how upgrades will affect the current dotProject environment. The process 
for creating a development is the same as for installing a production version of 
dotProject. Set aside a subfolder or sub domain where the environment will exist, 
then proceed with the installation as described earlier in this book. 
Troubleshooting Upgrades
The main errors seen during an upgrade are database or installscript errors. 
Even if you are upgrading by clicking a button on a control panel such as Fantastico, 
take the time to document and back up your database files and information. If the 
installation fails, your Internet Service Provider may be able to help you if 
you have saved information such as the database names, and other backup 
information. You should be prompted during a Fantastico upgrade to copy the 
backup information.

Database and Install Errors After Upgrade
First roll back the changes to the previous installation. You did back up the database 
and files, right? If you are upgrading from dotProject 2.0.2 to 2.0.4, just upload the 
new 2.0.4 files. Do not run the upgrade scripts in the install folder. The same 
problems will just occur again. If you grabbed your upgrade from the dotProject 
CVS, check Sourceforge.net and make sure you are using the most recent version 
from the stable_2 branch. The other dotProject branch is for development only. 
It is important to upgrade dotProject to version 2.04 to patch security issues. Full 
details can be found at the dotProject.net website and on the user forums. 
Contacts Issues or User Details Lost During 
an Upgrade
If you have a small number of users, you can connect them to their information on 
the contacts list. Connecting the users to their contact information should correct 
the issue. dotProject installations serving a large number of users will require an 
SQL script. If the database was backed up, as discussed earlier in this appendix, 
then it should be possible to upload the correct information to the new database. 
Administrators may need to insert a backed-up copy of the user table rows into the 
dotProject database if user information is missing. User and contact information can 
also be loaded and exported using CVS formats. Further details about resolving this 
issue can be found in the dotProject forums. 

Troubleshooting
There are many different types of errors that can be encountered during installation 
or use of a program. Always take the time to test the installation before deploying 
it into production. Appendix B will cover the most common type of error users 
experience after dotProject has been installed—Gantt Chart error. A variety of 
patches, fixes, and other solutions are available in the dotProject user forums at 
http://dotProject.net/vbulletin/. They will contain the most up-to-date 
information about errors and other issues. 
Resolving Gantt Chart Errors
Font Error ���������������������������������������������������������������
 is experienced when users click on the Gantt chart tab on the Projects 
screen or within individual projects. It is a source of great frustration for users 
and administrators. 
If you see an error as shown in the previous screenshot there are two fixes for this. 
Well three if you do a combination of the two. 

Troubleshooting
[ 212 ]
Method 1
You will need to upload a new fonts folder with the Arial fonts into the locales/
language/ folder of your dotProject installation. 
Then, update the jpGraph_config.inc file located in the /lib/jpGraph/src/ 
folder by adding the following line after the cache definition:
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
// DEFINE(“CACHE_DIR”,”/tmp/jpgraph_cache/”);
// DEFINE(“TTF_DIR”,”/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype/”);
//edited font source
DEFINE(“TTF_DIR”,”/home/leesjordan.net/public_html/yourwebteam/
locales/en/fonts/”); 
// end edited font source
// DEFINE(“MBTTF_DIR”,”/usr/share/fonts/ja/TrueType/”);
For most hosted solutions the generic format would be: 
DEFINE(“TTF_DIR”,”/home/mydomainname/public_html/
mydotprojectinstallation/locales/en/fonts/”);
Save the file and upload it back to the original jpGraph/src directory. Log in to the 
dotProject installation and attempt to view a Gantt chart on the projects list and on 
an individual project. You should see a result similar to the following screenshot:

Appendix B
[ 213 ]
Method 2
If the combined view of all the projects is not displayed and you do not want to 
download font files, then do the following. 
Download the gantt.php file from the modules/projects/ folder in the dotProject 
installation. Save it as a backup. Create a test folder, then find and replace FF_ARIAL 
with FF_FONT1. This will replace Arial with the internal system font and we need to 
upload the file. The combined projects Gantt chart should now display. 
Individual Project/Task Gantt Display Error (Fonts)
If your projects list combined view displays fine but you get an error similar to the 
following screenshot:
Then do the following:
Download the gantt.php file from the modules/tasks/ folder in the dotProject 
installation. Save it as a backup. Create a test folder, then find and replace FF_ARIAL 
with FF_FONT1. This will replace Arial with the internal system font. To see the 
changes we have to upload the file. This is what I had to do for individual Gantt 
charts to display properly.
