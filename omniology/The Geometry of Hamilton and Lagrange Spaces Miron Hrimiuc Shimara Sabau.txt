PREFACE
The title of this book is no surprise for people working in the field of Analytical
Mechanics. However, the geometric concepts of Lagrange space and Hamilton space
are completely new.
The geometry of Lagrange spaces, introduced and studied in [76],[96], was exten-
sively examined in the last two decades by geometers and physicists from Canada,
Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Romania, Russia and U.S.A. Many international
conferences were devoted to debate this subject, proceedings and monographs were
published [10], [18], [112], [113],... A large area of applicability of this geometry is
suggested by the connections to Biology, Mechanics, and Physics and also by its
general setting as a generalization of Finsler and Riemannian geometries.
The concept of Hamilton space, introduced in [105], [101] was intensively studied
in [63], [66], [97],... and it has been successful, as a geometric theory of the Hamil-
tonian function the fundamental entity in Mechanics and Physics. The classical
Legendre’s duality makes possible a natural connection between Lagrange and Ha-
milton spaces. It reveals new concepts and geometrical objects of Hamilton spaces
that are dual to those which are similar in Lagrange spaces. Following this duality
Cartan spaces introduced and studied in [98], [99],..., are, roughly speaking, the
Legendre duals of certain Finsler spaces [98], [66], [67]. The above arguments make
this monograph a continuation of [106], [113], emphasizing the Hamilton geometry.

The first chapter is an overview of the geometriy of the tangent bundle. Due to its
special geometrical structure, TM, furnishes basic tools that play an important role
in our study: the Liouville vector field C, the almost tangent structure J, the concept
of semispray. In the text, new geometrical structures and notions will be introduced.
By far, the concept of nonlinear connection is central in our investigations.
Chapter 2 is a brief review of some background material on Finsler spaces, in-
cluded not only because we need them later to explain some extensions of the subject,
but also using them as duals of Cartan spaces.
Some generalizations of Finsler geometry have been proposed in the last three
decades by relaxing requirements in the definition of Finsler metric. In the Lagran-
IX

The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
ge geometry, discussed in Chapter 3, the metric tensor is obtained by taking the
Hessian with respect to the tangential coordinates of a smooth function L defined
on the tangent bundle. This function is called a regular Lagrangian provided the
Hessian is nondegenerate, and no other conditions are envisaged.
Many aspects of the theory of Finsler manifolds apply equally well to Lagran-
ge spaces. However, a lot of problems may be totally different, especially those
concerning the geometry of the base space M. For instance, because of lack of the
homogeneity condition, the length of a curve on M, if defined as usual for Fin-
sler manifolds, will depend on the parametrization of the curve, which may not be
satisfactory.
In spite of this a Lagrange space has been certified as an excellent model for
some important problems in Relativity, Gauge Theory, and Electromagnetism. The
geometry of Lagrange spaces gives a model for both the gravitational and electro-
magnetic field in a very natural blending of the geometrical structures of the space
with the characteristic properties of these physical fields.
A Lagrange space is a pair 
where
is a regular
Lagrangian.
For every smooth parametrized curve 
the action integral may be
considered:
A geodesic of the Lagrange Space (M, L) is an extremal curve of the action integral.
This is, in fact, a solution of the Euler–Lagrange system of equations
where 
is a local coordinate expression of c.
This system is equivalent to
where
and
Here
are the components of a semispray that generates a notable nonlinear con-
nection, called canonical, whose coefficients are given by

XI
This nonlinear connection plays a fundamental role in the study of the geometry of
TM. It generates a splitting of the double tangent bundle
which makes possible the investigation of the geometry of TM in an elegant way, by
using tools of Finsler Spaces. We mention that when L is the square of a function
on TM, positively 1–homogeneous in the tangential coordinates (L is generated by
a Finsler metric), this nonlinear connection is just the classical Cartan nonlinear
connection of a Finsler space.
An other canonical linear connection, called distinguished, may be considered.
This connection preserves the above decomposition of the double tangent bundle and
moreover, it is metrical with respect to the metric tensor 
When L is generated
by a Finsler metric, this linear connection is just the famous Cartan’s metrical linear
connection of a Finsler space.
Starting with these geometrical objects, the entire geometry of TM can be ob-
tained by studying the curvature and torsion tensors, structure equations, geodesics,
etc. Also, a regular Lagrangian makes TM, in a natural way, a hermitian pseudo-
riemannian symplectic manifold with an almost symplectic structure.
Many results on the tangent bundle do not depend on a particular fundamental
function L, but on a metric tensor field. For instance, if 
is a Riemannian
metric on M and 
is a function depending explicitly on 
as well as directional
variables 
then, for example,
cannot be derived from a Lagrangian, provided 
Such situations are often
encountered in the relativistic optics. These considerations motivate our investiga-
tion made on the geometry of a pair 
where 
is a nondegenerate,
symmetric, constant signature d–tensor field on TM (i.e. 
transform as a
tensor field on M). These spaces, called generalized Lagrange spaces [96], [113], are
in some situations more flexible than that of Finsler or Lagrange space because of
the variety of possible selection for 
The geometric model of a generalized
Lagrange space is an almost Hermitian space which, generally, is not reducible to
an almost Kählerian space. These spaces, are briefly discussed in section 3.10.
Chapter 4 is devoted to the geometry of the cotangent bundle T*M, which fol-
lows the same outline as TM. However, the geometry of T*M is from one point
of view different from that of the tangent bundle. We do not have here a natural
tangent structure and a semispray cannot be introduced as usual for the tangent
bundle. Two geometrical ingredients are of great importance on T*M: the canonical
1-form 
and its exterior derivative 
 (the canonical symplectic

strucutre of T*M). They are systematically used to define new useful tools for our
next investigations.
Chapter 5 introduces the concept of Hamilton space [101], [105]. A regular Ha-
miltonian on T*M, is a smooth function 
such that the Hessian
matrix with entries
is everywhere nondegenerate on T*M (or a domain of T*M).
A Hamilton space is a pair
where H (x, p) is a regular Ha-
miltonian. As for Lagrange spaces, a canonical nonlinear connection can be derived
from a regular Hamiltonian but in a totally different way, using the Legendre trans-
formation. It defines a splitting of the tangent space of the cotangent bundle
which is crucial for the description of the geometry of T*M.
The case when H is the square of a function on T*M, positively 1-homogeneous
with respect to the momentum Pi, provides an important class of Hamilton spaces,
called Cartan spaces [98], [99]. The geometry of these spaces is developed in Chapter
6.
Chapter 7 deals with the relationship between Lagrange and Hamilton spaces.
Using the classical Legendre transformation different geometrical objects on TM are
nicely related to similar ones on T*M. The geometry of a Hamilton space can be
obtained from that of certain Lagrange space and vice versa. As a particular case,
we can associate to a given Finsler space its dual, which is a Cartan space. Here,
a surprising result is obtained: the L-dual of a Kropina space (a Finsler space) is a
Randers space (a Cartan space). In some conditions the L-dual of a Randers space
is a Kropina space. This result allows us to obtain interesting properties of Kropina
spaces by taking the dual of those already obtained in Randers spaces. These spaces
are used in several applications in Physics.
In Chapter 8 we study how the geometry of cotangent bundle changes under
symplectic transformations. As a special case we consider the homogeneous contact
transformations known in the classical literature. Here we investigate the so–called
”homogeneous contact geometry” in a more general setting and using a modern
approach. It is clear that the geometry of T*M is essentially simplified if it is
related to a given nonlinear connection. If 
the push forward of a
nonlinear connection by f is no longer a nonlinear connection and the geometry of
T*M is completely changed by f. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the
vertical distribution is not generally preserved by f. However, under appropriate
conditions a new distribution, called oblique results. We introduce the notion of
connection pair (more general than a nonlinear connection), which is the keystone
of the entire construction.

The last two decades many mathematical models from Lagrangian Mechanics,
Theoretical Physics and Variational Calculus systematically used multivariate La-
grangians of higher order acceleration,
[106].
The variational principle applied to the action integral
leads to Euler–Lagrange system of equations
which is fundamental for higher order Lagrangian Mechanics. The energy function
of order k is conservative along the integral curves of the above system.
From here one can see the motivation of the Lagrange geometry for higher order
Lagrangians to the bundle of acclerations of order k, (or the osculator bundle of
order k) denoted by 
and also the L-dual of this theory.
These subjects are developed in the next five chapters.
A higher order Lagrange space is a pair
where
M is a smooth differentiate manifold and
is a regular Lagrangian
or order k, [106]. The geometry of these spaces may be developed as a natural
extension of that of a Lagrange space. The metric tensor,
has to be nondegenerate on 
A central problem, about existence of regular
Lagrangians of order k, arises in this case. The bundle of prolongations of order k,
at 
of a Riemannian space on M is an example for the Lagrange space of order
k, [106].
We mention that the Euler–Lagrange equations given above are generated by
the Craig–Synge covector
that is used in the construction of the canonical semispray of

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
As a particular case, a Finsler space of order k is obtained if L is the square of
a positive k–homogeneous function on the bundle of accelerations of order k. Also
the class of generalized Lagrange spaces of order k may be considered.
Before starting to define the dual of 
we should consider the geometri-
cal entity 
having enough properties to deserve the name of dual of
The space 
should have the same dimension as 
should carry a natural
presymplectic structure and at least one Poisson structure. Although the subject
was discussed in literature (see [85]) the above conditions are not full verified for
the chosen duals.
Defining [110]:
then all the above conditions are satisfied. The two-form 
defines a
presymplectic structure and the Poisson brackets 
 a
Poisson structure.
The Legendre transformation is
where 
It is a locall diffeomorphism.
Now, the geometry of a higher order regular Hamiltonians may be developed as
we did for
The book ends with a description of 
the Cartem spaces of order 2, and
the Generalized Hamilton space or order 2.
For the general case the extension seems to be more difficult since the L–duality
process cannot be developed unless a nonlinear connection on 
is given in ad-
vance.
We should add that this book naturally prolongates the main topics presented in
the monographs: The Geometry of Lagrange Spaces. Theory and Applications (R.
Miron and M. Anastasiei), Kluwer, FTPH no.59; The Geometry of  Higher Order La-
grange Spaces. Applications to Mechanics and Physics (R. Miron), Kluwer, FTPH,

Chapter 1
The geometry of tangent bundle
The geometry of tangent bundle 
over a smooth, real, finite dimensional
manifold M is one of the most important fields of the modern differential geometry.
The tangent bundle TM carries some natural object fields, as: Liouville vector field
tangent structure J, the vertical distribution V. They allow to introduce the
notion of semispray S, which is a tangent vector field of TM, having the property
We will see that the geometry of the manifold TM can be constructed
using only the notion of semispray.
The entire construction is basic for the introduction of the notion of Finsler
space or Lagrange space [112], [113]. In the last twenty years this point of view
was adopted by the authors of the present monograph in the development of the
geometrical theory of the spaces which can be defined on the total space TM of
tangent bundle. There exists a rich literature concerning this subject.
In this chapter all geometrical object fields and all mappings are considered of
the class 
expressed by the words ”differentiate” or ”smooth”.
1.1 
The manifold TM
Let M be a real differentiable manifold of dimension n. A point of M will be denoted
by x and its local coordinate system by 
The indices i, j, ... run
over set {1, ..., n} and Einstein convention of summarizing is adopted all over this
book.
The tangent bundle 
of the manifold M can be identified with the
1-osculator bundle 
see the definition below.
Indeed, let us consider two curves 
having images in a domain of
local chart 
We say that 
and 
have a ”contact of order 1” or the ”same
tangent line” in the point 
if: 
and for any function

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
The relation ”contact of order 1” is an equivalence on the set of smooth curves in
M, which pass through the point 
Let 
be a class of equivalence. It will be
called a ”1–osculator space” in the point 
  The set of 1–osculator spaces in
the point 
will be denoted by 
and we put
One considers the mapping 
defined by 
Clearly, 
is
a surjection.
The set 
is endowed with a natural differentiable structure, induced by
that of the manifold M, so that 
is a differentiable mapping. It will be described
below.
The curve 
is analyticaly represented in the local chart
by 
taking the function f from (1.1),
succesively equal to the coordinate functions 
then a representative of the class
is given by
The previous polynomials are determined by the coefficients
Hence, the pair 
with 
 is a
local chart on 
M. Thus a differentiable atlas 
of the differentiable structure
on the manifold M determines a differentiable atlas
on 
 and therefore
the triple ( 
M) is a differentiable bundle.
Based on the equations (1.2) we can identify the point 
 with the
tangent vector 
Consequently, we can indeed identify the 1–osculator
bundle with the tangent bundle (TM, 
M).
By (1.2) a transformation of local coordinates 
on the manifold
TM is given by

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle

One can see that TM is of dimension 2n and is orientable.
Moreover, if M is a paracompact manifold, then TM is paracompact, too.
Let us present here some notations. A point 
whose projection by 
is
   x, i.e. 
will be denoted by (x,y), its local coordinates being 
We
put 
where {0} means the null section of
The coordinate transformation (1.3) determines the transformation of the natural
basis
of the tangent space 
TM at the point 
the
following:
By means of (1.3) we obtain
Looking at the formula (1.4) we remark the existence of some natural object fields
on E.
First of all, the tangent space 
to the fibre 
in the point 
is locally
spanned by 
. Therefore, the mapping V :
provides a regular distribution which is generated by the adapted basis
(i = 1, ..., n). Consequently, V is an integrable distribution on TM. V is called the
vertical distribution on TM.
Taking into account (1.3), (1.4), it follows that
is a vertical vector field on TM, which does not vanish on the manifold 
It is
called the Liouville vector field. The existence of the Liouville vector field is very
important in the study of the geometry of the manifold TM.
Let us consider the              –linear mapping
Theorem 1.1.1. The following properties hold:
1°   J is globally  defined on TM.
2°

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
3° J is an integrable structure on E.
4°
The proof can be found in [113].
We say that J is the tangent structure on E.
The previous geometrical notions are useful in the next sections of this book.
1.2 Homogeneity
The notion of homogeneity of functions 
with respect to the variables
is necessary in our considerations because some fundamental object fields on E
have the homogeneous components.
In the osculator manifold 
a point 
has a geometrical meaning,
i.e. changing of parametrization of the curve 
does not change the space
Taking into account the affine transformations of parameter
we obtain the transformation of coordinates of 
in the form
Therefore, the transformations of coordinates (1.3) on the manifold E preserve
the transformations (2.2).
Let us consider
the group of  homoteties of real numbers field R.
H acts as an uniparameter group of transformations on E as follows
where 
is the point 
Consequently, H
acts as a group of transformations on TM, with the preserving of the fibres.
The orbit of a point 
is given by
The tangent vector to orbit in the point 
is given by
.

This is the Liouville vector field 
in the point u0.
Now we can formulate:
Definition 1.2.1. A function 
differentiable on 
and continuous
on the null section 
is called homogeneous of degree r, 
on the
fibres of TM, (briefly: r–homogeneous with respect to 
) if:
The following Euler theorem holds [90], [106]:
Theorem 1.2.1. A function 
differentiable on 
and continuous on
the null sections is homogeneous of degree r on the fibres of TM if and only if we
have
being the Lie derivative with respect to the Liouville vector field
Remark. If we preserve Definition 1.2.1 and ask for 
 to be differentia-
ble on TM (inclusive on the null section), then the property of 1–homogeneity of f
implies that f is a linear function in variables
The equality (2.4) is equivalent to
The following properties hold:
1°
2°
3°
Definition 1.2.2. A vector field 
is r-homogeneous if
It follows:
Theorem 1.2.2. A  vector field 
is r-homogeneous if and only if we
have
(2.5)
Of course, 
 is the Lie derivative of X with respect to
Consequently, we can prove:

6 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
1° The vector fields 
are 1 and 0-homogeneous, respectively.
2° If 
is s-homogeneous and 
is r-homogeneous then f X
is s + r-homogeneous.
3° A vector field on
is r–homogeneous if and only if 
are functions ( r – l)-homogeneous and
are functions r-homogeneous.
4° 
is r-homogeneous and 
is s-homogeneous, then
is a (r + s – 1)-homogeneous function.
5° The Liouville vector field 
is 1-homogeneous.
6° If 
is an arbitrary s-homogeneous function, then 
is a (s – 1)-
homogeneous function and 
is (s – 2)-homogeneous function.
In the case of q-form we can give:
Definition 1.2.3. A q-form 
is s-homogeneous if
It follows [106]:
Theorem 1.2.3. A q-form 
 is s-homogeneous if and only if

are 1-homogeneous 1-forms.
The applications of those properties in the geometry of Finsler space are num-
berless.

1.3 
Semisprays on the manifold
One of the most important notions in the geometry of tangent bundle is given in
the following definition:
Definition 1.3.1. A semispray S on 
is a vector field 
with the
property:
If S is homogeneous, then S will be called a spray.
Of course, the notion of a local semispray can be formulated taking
being an open set in the manifold
Theorem 1.3.1.
1° A semispray S can be uniquely written in the form
2° The set of functions
(i = 1, ..., n) are changed with respect to (1.3) as
follows:
3° If the set of functions 
  are a priori given on every domain of a local chart
in 
so that (3.3) holds, then S from (3.2) is a semispray.
Proof. 1° If a vector field 
is a semispray S, then
implies 
and
So that 
are uniquely determined and (3.2) holds.
2° The formula (3.3) followsfrom (1.3), (1.4) and the fact that S is a vector field
on    i.e.
3° Using the rule of transformation (3.3) of the set of functions 
it follows that
is a vector field which satisfies
q.e.d.
From the previous theorem, it results that S is uniquely determined by
and conversely. Because of this reason, 
 are called the coefficients of the semispray
S.

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 1.3.2. A semispmy S is a spray if and only if its  coefficients 
 are
2-homogeneous functions with respect to
Proof. By means of 1° and 3° from the consequences of Theorem 2.2 it follows
that  
is 2-homogeneous and 
is 0–homogeneous vector fields. Hence, S is
2–homogeneous if and only if 
are 2–homogeneous functions with respect to
The integral curves of the semispray S from (3.2) are given by
It follows that, on M, these curves are expressed as solutions of the following diffe-
rential equations
The curves 
solutions of (3.5), are called the paths of
the semispray S. The differential equation (3.5) has geometrical meaning. Con-
versely, if the differential equation (3.5) is given on a domain of a local chart U
of the manifold M, and this equation is preserved by the transformations of local
coordinates on M, then coefficients 
obey the transformations
(3.3). Hence 
are the coefficients of a semispray. Consequently:
Theorem 1.3.3. A semispray S on 
with the  coefficients 
is characte-
rized by a system of differential equations (3.5), which has a geometrical meaning.
Now, we are able to prove
Theorem 1.3.4. If  the base manifold M is paracompact, then on 
there exist
semisprays.
Proof. M being paracompact, there is a Riemannian metric g on M. Consider
the Christoffel symbols of g. Then the set of functions
is transformed, by means of a transformation (1.3), like in formula (3.3). Theorem
1.3.1 may be applied. It follows that the set of functions 
 are the coefficients of a
semispray S.

is a remarkable geometrical object field on 
(called non-
linear connection).
Finally, in this section, taking into account the previous remark, we consider the
functions determined by a semispray S:
Using the rule of transformation (3.3) of the coefficients 
we can prove, without
difficulties:
Theorem 1.3.5.   If 
        are the coefficients of a semispray S, then the set of
functions   
from (3.6) has the following rule of transformationwith respect
to (1.3):
In the next section we shall prove that 
 are the coefficients of a nonlinear
connection on the manifold E = TM.
1.4 
Nonlinear connections
The notion of nonlinear connection on the manifold E = TM is essentially for study
the geometry of TM. It is fundamental in the geometry of Finsler and Lagrange
spaces [113].
Our approach will be two folded:
1° As a splitting in the exact sequence (4.1).
2° As a derivate notion from that of semispray.

10 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Let us consider as previous the tangent bundle (TM, 
M) of the manifold M.
It will be written in the form (E, 
M) with E = TM. The tangent bundle of the
manifold E is (TE, 
E), where 
is the tangent mapping of the projection
As we know the kernel of 
is the vertical subbundle  (VE, 
E ). Its fibres are
the linear vertical spaces
A tangent vector vector field on E can be represented in the local natural frame
on E by
It can be written in the form 
or, shorter, 
The
mapping 
has the local form
The points of submanifold VE are of the form (x, y, 0, Y). Hence, the fibres 
of
the vertical bundle are isomorphic to the real vector space
Let us consider the pullback bundle
The fibres of 
are isomorphic to 
We can define the following
morphism of vector bundles 
It follows that
By means of these considerations one proves without difficulties that the following
sequence is exact:
Now, we can give:
Definition 1.4.1. 
A nonlinear connection on the manifold E = TM is a left
splitting of the exact sequence (4.1).
Therefore, a nonlinear connection on E is a vector bundle morphism
with the property
The kernel of the morphism C is a vector subbundle of the tangent bundle
(TE, 
E), denoted by (HE, 
E) and called the horizontal subbundle. Its
fibres 
determine a distribution 
supplementary to the
vertical distribution 
Therefore, a nonlinear connection N
induces the following Whitney sum:

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle 
11
The reciprocal property holds [112]. So we can formulate:
Theorem 1.4.1. A nonlinear connection N on E = TM is characterized by the
existence of a subbundle (HE, 
E) of tangent bundle of E such that the Whitney
sum (4.2) holds.
Consequences.
1° A nonlinear connection N on E is a distribution
with the property
and conversely.
2° The restriction of the morphism 
  to the HE is an isomorphism
of vector bundles.
3° The component 
 of the mapping 
is a morphism of vector bun-
dles whose restrictions to fibres are isomorphisms. Hence for any vector field X
on M there exists an horizontal vector field 
on E such that
is called the horizontal lift of the vector field X on M.
Using the inverse of the isomorphism 
 we can define the morphism of vector
bundles 
such that 
 In other words, D is a right
splitting of the exact sequence (4.1). One can easy see that the bundle Im D coincides
with the horizontal subbundle HE. The tangent bundle TE will decompose as
Whitney sum of horizontal and vertical subbundle. We can define now the mor-
phism 
on fibres as being the identity on vertical vectors and zero
on the horizontal vectors. It follows that C is a left splitting of the exact sequence
(4.1). Moreover, the mapping C and D satisfy the relation:
So, we have
Theorem 1.4.2. A nonlinear connection on the tangent bundle 
is
characterized by a right splitting of the exact sequence (4.1), 
 such
that
The set of isomorphisms 
 defines a canonical isomorphism
r between the vertical subbundle and the vector bundle
Definition 1.4.2. The map 
given by 
is called the
connection map associated to the nonlinear connection C, where p2 is the projection
on the second factor of

12 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
It follows that the connection map K is a morphism of vector bundles, whose
kernel is the horizontal bundle HE. In general, the map K is not linear on the fibres
of  ( E, 
 M ).
The local representation of the mapping K is
Let us consider a nonlinear connection determined by C and K the connection map
associated to C, with the local expression given by (4.3). Taking into account (4.3)
and the definition of C, we get the local expression of the nonlinear connection:
The differential functions 
defined on the domain of
local charts on E are called the coefficients of the nonlinear connection. These
functions characterize a nonlinear connection in the tangent bundle.
Proposition 1.4.1. To give a nonlinear connection in the tangent bundle (TM, 
M)
is equivalent to give a set of real functions 
 on every coor-
dinate neighbourhood of TM, which on the intersection of coordinate neighbourhoods
satisfies the following transformation rule:
Proof. The formulae (4.4) are equivalent with the second components
of the connection map K from (4.3) under the overlap charts are changed as follows
Applying Theorem 1.3.5 we get:
Theorem 1.4.3. A semispray S on 
with the  coefficients 
  determines
a nonlinear connection N with the coefficients
Conversely, if 
are the coefficients of a nonlinear connection N, then
are the coefficients of a semispray on
The nonlinear connection N, determined by the morphism C is called homoge-
neousand linear if the connection map K associated to C has this property, respec-
tively.

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle
13
Taking into account (4.3) and the local expression of the mapping 
it follows
that N is homogeneous iff its  coefficients 
are homogeneous.
Exactly as in Theorem 1.3.4, we can prove:
Theorem 1.4.4. If the manifold M is pracompact, then there exists nonlinear
connections on

Now, let 
be the inclusion and for 
consider the usual
identification 
 We obtain a natural isomorphism

it follows
The canonical isomorphism 
is the inverse of the isomorphism
defined by
Explicitely, we have
Consequently, we can define 
–linear mapping 
by
Proposition 1.5.1.
1° The mapping (5.1) is the tangent structure J investigated in
2° In the natural basis J is given by
In the same manner we can introduce the notion of almost product structure
on TM.
Based on the fact that direct decomposition (4.2)' holds when a nonlinear con-
nection N is given, we consider the vertical projector 
  defined
by

14 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Of course, we have 
The projector v coincides with the mapping C considered
as morphism between modules of sections. So, N is characterized by a vertical
projector v.
On the same way, a nonlinear connection on TM is characterized by a
linear mapping 
for which:
The mapping h is called the horizontal projector determined by a nonlinear connec-
tion N.
We have h + v = I.
Finally, any vector field 
can be uniquely written as follows X =
hX + vX. In the following we adopt the notations
and we say 
is a horizontal component of vector field X, but 
is the vertical
component.
So, any 
can be uniquely written in the form
Theorem 1.5.1. A nonlinear connection N in the vector bundle (TM, 
M) is
characterized by an almost product structure 
on the manifold TM whose distri-
bution of eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalue –1 coincides to the vertical
distribution on TM.
Proof. Given a nonlinear connection N, we consider the vertical projector v deter-
mined by N and set 
It follows
  Hence 
is an almost product
structure on TM. We have
Conversely, if an almost product structure 
on TM is given, and 
has the pro-
perty (*), we set 
It results that v is a vertical projector and therefore
it determines a nonlinear connection N.
The following relations hold:
Taking into account the properties of the tangent structure J and almost product
structure 
we obtain

15
Let us consider the horizontal lift determined by a nonlinear connection N

Denote the horizontal lift of vector fields

Moreover,

Consequently, it follows that

Lemma 1.5.2. Under a transformation of coordinates (1.3) on TM, we obtain
Consequently, the tensorial equations 
have geometrical mean-

Therefore, we get:
Lemma 1.5.3. The horizontal distribution HTM is integrable if and only if we
have on TM:
Indeed, from (5.12), the Lie brackets 
give an horizontal vector fields

The previous property allows to say that

Let N be a nonlinear connection on the manifold E = TM. We have the direct

belongs to the horizontal distribution HTM.
Taking the adapted basis 
to the direct decomposition (4.2)' we can

So, ifthe functions

A horizontal curve c with the property 
is said to be an autoparallel
curve of the nonlinear connection N.
Proposition 1.6.1. An autoparallel curve of the nonlinear connection N, with the
coefficients 
 is characterized by the system of differential equations
Now we study shortly the algebra of the distinguished tensor fields on the ma-
nifold 
TM = E.
Definition 1.6.1. A tensor field T of type (r, s) on the manifold E is called distin-
guished tensor field (briefly, a d-tensor) if it has the property
For instance, the components 
and 
from (6.1) of a vector field X are
d–tensor fields. Also the components 
and 
of an 1-form 
from (6.2) are
d-l-form fields.
Clearly, the set 
of the d-tensor fields of type (r, s) is a             module and
the module
 is a tensor algebra. It is not difficult to see that any
tensor field on E can be written as a sum of d-tensor fields.
We express a d-tensor field T from (6.5) in the adapted basis 
and
adapted cobasis 
From (6.5) we get the components of T:
So, T is expressed by
Taking into account the formulae (5.7) and (6.5)', we obtain:
Proposition 1.6.2. With respect to (1.5) the components 
 of a d-tensor
field T of type (r, s) are transformed by the rules:

20 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
But (6.7) is just the classical law of transformation of the local coefficients of a
tensor field on the base manifold M.
Of course, (6.7) characterizes the d-tensor fields of type (r, s) on the manifold
E = TM (up to the choice of the basis from (6.6)). Using the local expression (6.6)
of a d-tensor field it follows that 
, (i = 1, ..., n), generate the d-tensor
algebra

and 
from (5.12), (5.13) are d-tensor fields of type (1,2).
2° The Liouville vector field 
is a d-vector field.

N–linear connections
Let N be an a priori given nonlinear connection on the manifold E = TM.
The adapted basis to N and V is 
and adapted cobasis is its dual
Definition 1.7.1. A linear connection D (i.e. a Kozul connection or covariant
derivative) on the manifold E = TM is called an N–linear connection if:
1° D preserves by parallelism the horizontal distribution N.
2° The tangent structure J is absolute parallel with respect to D, that is DJ = 0.
Consequently, the following properties hold:
We will denote
Thus, we obtain the following expression of D:

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle 
21
The operators 
and 
are special derivations in the algebra 
of d-tensor fields
on E. Of course, 
are not covariant derivations, because
However the operators 
and 
have similar properties
to D. For instance, 
and 
satisfy the Leibniz rule with respect of tensorial
product of d-tensor fields. It is important to remark that 
and 
applied to
d-tensor fields give us the d-tensor fields, too. We can see these important properties
on the local representtion of 
and 
in the adapted basis 
 and
will be called the h-covariant derivation and v-covariant derivation, respectively.
Remarking that 
we obtain:
Proposition 1.7.1. In the adapted basis 
an N–linear connection D
can be uniquely represented in the form:
The system of functions 
gives us the coefficients
of the h-covariant derivative 
and of the v-covariant derivative 
respectively.
Proposition 1.7.2. With respect to the changes of local coordinates on TM, the
coefficients 
 of an N–linear connection D are transformed as
follows:
Indeed, the formulae (7.4) and (5.7) imply the rules transformation (7.5).

the operator of v-covariant derivative and remark that
is a d-tensor field with one more index of a covariance.
The operators 
and 
have the known properties of a general covariant
derivatives, applied to any d-tensor field T, taking into account the facts:
for any function
An important application can be done for the Liouville vector field
The following d-tensor fields
are called the h- and v-deflection tensor fields of the N-linear connection D.
Proposition 1.7.3. The deflection tensor fields are given by
Indeed, applying the formulae (7.7), (7.8) we get the equalities (7.9)'.
The d-tensor of deflections are important in the geometry of tangent bundle.

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle

A N–linear connection D is called of Cartan type if its tensor of deflection have
the property:
From the last proposition, it follows
Proposition 1.7.4 The N–linear connection 
is of Cartan
type if and only if we have
We will see that the canonical metrical connection in a Finsler space is of Cartan
type.
We can prove [113]:
Theorem 1.7.1. If M is a paracompact manifold then there exist N–linear connec-
tions on TM.
1.8 
Torsion and curvature
The torsion of a N–linear connection d is given by
Using the projectors, h, and v associated to the horizontal distribution N and to
the vertical distribution V, we find
Taking into account the property of  skew-symmetry of       and the fact that
0 we find
Theorem 1.8.1. The torsion 
of an N–linear connection is completely determined
by the following d-tensor fields:

24 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Corollary 1.8.1. The following properties hold:
a) 
is an integrable distribution.
b)
We shall say that 
is h(hh)–torsion of D, that 
is v(hh)–
torsion, etc.
Since the Lie brackets of the vector field from the adapted basis are given by the
formula (5.12), we obtain
Theorem 1.8.2. 
The local components, in the adapted basis 
of the
torsion 
of an N –linear connection are as follows:
Proof. These local coefficients are provided by the five formulae (8.2) if we consider
instead of X and Y the components of the adapted basis
The curvature of a N–linear connection D is given by
It is not difficult to prove the following theorems:
Theorem 1.8.3. The curvature tensor 
of the N–linear connection D has the
properties:
Theorem 1.8.4. The curvature of an N–linear connection D on TM is completely
determined by the following three d-tensor fields:

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle 
25
Remark. The curvature 
has six components. But the property
shows that only three components, namely the one in (8.6) are essential.
In the adapted basis, the local coefficients of the d-tensors of curvature are given
by
Now, using Proposition 1.7.1, we obtain:
Theorem 1.8.5. In the adapted basis the d-tensors of curvature 
 and
of an N–linear connection 
are as follows:
where | denotes, as usual, the h-covariant derivative with respect to the N–linear
connection
The expressions (8.6) of the d-tensors of curvature
and 
in the adapted basis lead to the Ricci identities satisfied by an
N–linear connection D.
Proposition 
1.8.1. 
The Ricci identities of the N–linear connection
are:
where 
is an arbitrary d-vector field.
The Ricci identities for an arbitrary d-tensor field hold also.

26 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
For instance if 
is a d-tensor field, then the following formulae of the
commutation of second h- and v-covariant derivative hold:
Applying the Ricci identities(8.9) to the Liouville vector field
we
deduce some fundamental identities in the theory of N–linear connections. Taking
into account the h- and v-deflection tensors 
we have from (8.9):
Theorem 1.8.6. For any N–linear connection 
the  following
identities hold:
Corollary 1.8.2.    If 
     is an N–linear connection of Cartan type, then the
following relations hold:
The d-torsions and d-curvature tensors of an N–linear connection
are not independent. They satisfy the Bianchi identities[113], obtained
by writting in the adapted basis the following Bianchi identities, verified by the
linear connection D:
where 
means the cyclic sum over X, Y, Z.
1.9 Parallelism. Structure equations
Consider an N–linear connection D with the  coefficients 
in
the adapted basis

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle 
27
If c is a parametrized curve in the manifold
with the property 
then its tangent vector field 
 can
be written in the form (6.3), i.e.
The curve c is horizontal if 
and it is an autoparallel curve of the nonlinear
connection
We denote
Here 
is the covariant differential along with the curve c of the N–linear con-
nection D.
Setting 
we have
Let us consider
The objects
are called the ”1-forms connection” of D.
Then the equation (9.3) takes the form:
The vector X on TM is said to be parallel along with the curve c, with respect to
N–linear connection D if 
A glance at (9.3) shows that the last equation
is equivalent to 
Using the formula (9.5) we find the following
result:
Proposition 1.9.1. The vector field 
  from            is parallel
along the parametrized curve c in TM, with respect to the N–linear connection

28 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
if and only if   its   coefficients 
and
are solutions of the linear system of differential equations
A theorem of existence and uniqueness for the parallel vector fields along with a
curve c on the manifold TM can be formulated.
A horizontal path of an N–linear connection D on TM is a horizontal parametrized
curve 
with the property
Using (9.1) and (9.5), with 
we obtain the following
theorem:
Theorem 1.9.1. The horizontal paths of an N–linear connection
are characterized by the system of differential equations:
Now we can consider a curve 
in the fibre 
It can be repre-
sented by the equations
The above 
is called a vertical curve of TM in the point
A vertical curve 
is called a vertical path with respect to the N–linear connec-
tion D if
Again the formulae (9.1), (9.5) lead to:
Theorem 1.9.2. The vertical paths in the point 
with respect to the N–linear
connection 
are characterized by the system of differential e-
quations
Obviously, the local existence and uniqueness of horizontal paths are assured if
the initial conditions for (9.6) are given. The same consideration can be made for
vertical paths, (9.7).
Considering the 1-form of connection 
from (9.4) and the exterior differential
of the 1-forms from the adapted dual basis 
we can determine the structure
equations of a N–linear connection D on the manifold TM.

Ch.1. The geometry of tangent bundle 
29
Lemma 1.9.1.
The exterior differentials of  1-forms
are given
by
where
Indeed, a straightforward calculus on the exterior differential 
 leads to (9.8).
Remark. 
from (9.8)' are the h-coefficients of an N–linear connection, called
the Berwald connection.
Lemma 1.9.2. With respect to a changing of local coordinate on TM, the following
2-forms
are transformed like a d-vector field and the 2-forms
are transformed like a d-tensor field of type (1,1).
Indeed, taking into account Lemma 1.9.1 and the expression of 1-forms of con-
nection 
the previous lemma can be proved.
Now, we can formulate the result:
Theorem 1.9.3. The structure equations of an N–linear connection
on the manifold TM are given by
where 
and 
are the 2-forms of torsion

30 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
and the 2-forms of curvature 
are expressed by
Proof. By means of Lemma 1.9.2, the general structure equations of a linear con-
nection on TM are particularized for an N–linear connection D in the form (9.9).
Using 1-forms connection 
from (9.4) and the formula (9.8), we can calculate,
without difficulties, the 2-forms of torsion 
and the 2-forms of curvature
obtaining the expressions (9.10) and (9.11).
The geometrical theory on the manifold TM of tangent bundle will be used in
next chapters for studying the geometries of Finsler and Lagrange spaces.

Chapter 2
Finsler spaces
The notion of general metric space appeared for the first time in the disertation of
B. Riemann in 1854. After sixty five years, P. Finsler in his Ph.D. thesis introduced
the concept of general metric function, which can be studied by means of  variational
calculus. Later, L. Berwald, J.L. Synge and E. Cartan precisely gave the correct
definition of a Finsler space.
During eighty years, famous geometers studied the Finsler geometry in connec-
tion with variational problem, geometrical theory of tangent bundle and for its
applications in Mechanics, Physics or Biology. In the last 40 years, some remarkable
books on Finsler geometry were published by H. Rund, M. Matsumoto, R. Miron
and M. Anastasiei, A. Bejancu, Abate–Patrizio, D. Bao, S.S. Chern and Z.Shen, P.
Antonelli, R.Ingarden and M. Matsumoto.
In the present chapter we made a brief introduction in the geometry of Finsler
spaces in order to study the relationships between these spaces and the dual notion
of Cartan spaces.
In the following we will study: Finsler metrics, Cartan nonlinear connection,
canonical metrical connections and their structure equations.
Some special classes of Finsler manifolds as          –metrics, Berwald spaces will
be pointed out. We underline the important role which the Sasaki lift plays for
almost Kählerian model of a Finsler manifold, as well as the new notion of homoge-
neous lift of the Finsler metrics in the framework of this theory.
2.1 
Finsler metrics
At the begining we define the notion of Finsler metric and Finsler manifold.
Definition 2.1.1. A Finsler manifold (or Finsler space) is a pair
where M is a real n-dimensional differentiable manifold and 
a scalar
function which satisfy the following axioms:
31

32
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
1° F is a differentiable function on the manifold 
and F is con-
tinuous on the null section of the projection
2° F is a positive function.
3° F is positively 1-homogeneous on the fibres of tangent bundle TM.
4° The Hessian of 
with elements
is positively defined on
Proposition 2.1.1. The set of functions 
 from (1.1) is transformed, with
respect to (1.3) in Ch.l, by the rule
Indeed, in virtue of (1.4) in Ch.l we have:
and
Consequently (1.2) holds.
Because of (1.2) we say that 
is a distinguished tensor field (briefly d-tensor
field). Of course, 
is a covariant symmetric of order 2 d-tensor field defined on
the manifold
The function F(x, y) is called fundamental function and the d-tensor field 
 is
called fundamental (or metric) tensor of the Finsler space
Examples.
1° A Riemannian manifold 
determines a Finsler manifold
where
(1.3)
The fundamental tensor of this Finsler space is coincident to the metric tensor
of the Riemann space
2° Let us consider the function

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
33
defined in a preferential local system of coordinate on
The pair 
with F defined in (1.4) satisfies the axioms 1-4 from
Definition 2.1.1. So, 
is a Finsler space. The fundamental tensor field 
 can be
easy calculated.
Remark. This was the first example of Finsler space from the literature of the
subject. It was given by B. Riemann in 1854.
3° Antonelli–Shimada’s ecological metric is given, in a preferential local system
of coordinate on 
by
( 
are positive constants),
where 
being even.
4° Randers metric. Let us consider the function of a Finsler space
where 
is a Riemannian metric and 
 is a dif-
ferential linear function in 
This metric is called a Randers metric and was
introduced by the paper [135]. The fundamental tensor of the Randers space
is given by [89]:
and one can prove that the fundamental tensor field 
is positive definite
under the condition 
(see the book [24]).
The first example motivates the following theorem:
Theorem 2.1.1. If the base manifold M is paracompact, then there exist functions
which are fundamental functions for Finsler manifolds.
Regarding the axioms 1-4 formulated in Definition 2.1.1, we can prove without
difficulties.
Theorem 2.1.2. The system of axioms of a Finsler space is minimal.
However, the axiom 4° of this system is sometimes too strong in applications of
Finsler geometry in construction of geometrical models in other scientific disciplines,
for instance in theoretical physics.

34 
The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Let us consider the fibre 
in a point 
of the tangent bundle
It is known that 
is a real n-dimensional vector space. The
set of points
is called the indicatrix of Finsler space 
in the point
The restriction 
of the fundamental function F to the fibre 
de-
termines a Riemann metric 
in the submanifold 
immersed in the
manifold TM. Since 
is positively defined, the following property holds,
[139]:
Theorem 2.1.3. If a Finsler manifold 
has the property: in every
point 
the indicatrix 
is strictly convex, then the axiom 4° is satisfied.
If one retains the axioms 1°, 2°, 3° from the Definition 2.1.1 of a Finsler manifold
and add the following axiom 4´:
4´ a. rank 
on
b. signature of d-tensor field 
is constant,
it results the notion of Finsler manifold with semidefinite metric. If the axioms 1°,
2°, 3°, 4´ are satisfied on an open set 
we will say that we have a
Finsler space with the semidefinite metric on the open set
In general, Randers metric 
(without the condition 
) give rise to
Finsler spaces with semi–definite Finsler metrics.
In the following sections of chapters of the present monograph we refer to the
Finsler spaces with the definite or semidefinite metric without mention the difference
between them.
2.2 Geometric objects of the space
The property of 1-homogeneity of the fundamental function F(x, y) of the Finsler
space 
induces properties of homogeneity of the geometrical objects derived from
it.
Theorem 2.2.1. On a Finsler manifold 
the following properties hold:
1° The components of the fundamental tensor field 
are 0–homogeneous, i.e.,
2° The functions

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
35
are 1–homogeneous.
3° The functions
are (–l)–homogeneous.
In the same time we have some natural object fields:
Proposition 2.2.1.
1° The quantity Pi from (2.2) is a d–covector field.
2° The set of functions 
from (2.3) is a covariant of order 3 symmetric d–
tensor field.
3° 
is a scalar field, if 
is a d-vector field.
4° 
is a scalar field, 
being d-vector fields.
The proof of previous properties is elementary. 
is called the square of norm
of vector field X and 
is the scalar product (calculated in a point
Assuming 
the angle 
in a point
between vectors 
are given by the solution 
of
the trigonometric equation
The number 
is uniquely determined, because in a Finsler space with the definite
metric cos 
from (2.4) satisfy the condition
Other properties are given by
Proposition 2.2.2. In a Finsler manifold 
the following identities
hold:
1°
2°
3°
4°

36 
The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Some natural object fields are introduced in the following:
Theorem 2.2.2. In a Finsler manifold 
we have the following natural
object fields:
1° The Liouville vector field
2° The Hamilton 1-form
3° The symplectic structure
Proof. 1° The Liouville vector field 
exists on the manifold TM independently of
the metrical function F of the space
(cf. 
Ch.l).
2° By means of Proposition 2.2.1 and on the fact that with respect to (1.1) it
follows that 
does not depend on the changing of local coordinates.
3° 
is a closed 2-form on 
and
q.e.d.
Definition 2.2.2. A Finsler space 
is called reducible to a Rie-
mannian space if its fundamental tensor field does not depend on the directional
variables
The previous definition has a geometrical meaning, since the equation
does not depend on the changing of local coordinates.
Theorem 2.2.3. 
A Finsler space 
is reducible to a Riemannian space iff the
tensor 
is vanishing on the manifold
Proof. If 
does not depend on 
thus from the identity

the condition 
implies 
Conversely, 
on 
and (2.8)
implies 
on
Let us consider another geometrical notion: the arc length of a smooth curve in
a Finsler manifold
Let c be a parametrized curve in the manifold M:
U being a domain of a local chart in M.
The curve c has an analytical expression of form:
The extension 
of c to 
is defined by the equations
Thus the restriction of the fundamental function F(x, y) to 
 is
We define the ”length” of curve c with extremities c(0), c(l) by the number
The number L(c) does not depend by the changing of coordinates on 
and,
by means of 1-homogeneity of the fundamental function F, L(c) does not depend
on the parametrization of the curve c. So L(c) depends on c, only.
We can fix a canonical parameter on the curve c, given by the arclength of c.
Indeed, the function 
given by
is derivable, having the derivative:

38
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
So the function 
is invertible. Let 
be its inverse. The
change of parameter
given by 
has the property
So, we have:
Theorem 2.2.4. In a Finsler space 
for any smooth curve
exists a canonical parameter s with the property (2.11).
2.3 Geodesies
Let us consider a smooth parametrized curve 
 having
the ending points c(0) and c(l). Its length is given by the formula (2.10). We will
formulate the variational problem for the functional L(c). Consider a vector field
along the curve c with the properties 
Let 
be a
set of smooth curve given by the mappings
such that the analytical expression of 
being
with 
small, 
being real number. So, the curves 
have the same end points
c(0), c(l) and same tangent vectors in this points with curve c. The length of the
curve 
is given by
The necessary condition for L(c) to be extremal value of 
is as follows
This equality is equivalent to
Integrating by parts the second term one obtains

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
39
Since 
is an arbitrary d-vector field we get from the previous equation the following
Euler–Lagrange equations
Definition 2.3.1. The curves 
solutions of the Euler–La-
grange equations (3.1) are called geodesies of theFinsler space
Since 
the equations (3.1) are equivalent to the system
of equations
Substituting 
    we get the following form of the previous Euler–Lagrange
equations
where
the functions 
being the Christoffel symbols of the fundamental tensor field
This is
Changing now to the canonical parameter s, we have 
The equations
(3.2) become
Theorem 2.3.1. Geodesics in a Finsler space 
in the canonical parametrization
are given by the differential equations (3.5).
A theorem of existence and uniqueness of the solutions of differential equations
(3.5) can be formulated.

2.4 
Canonical spray. Cartan nonlinear connec-
tion
For a Finsler space 
we can define a canonical spray S and an impor-
tant nonlinear connection. Noticing that the function 
is a regular Lagrangian,
we introduce its energy by:
Thus, integral action of the Lagrangian L(x, y) along with smooth parametrized
curve 
is given by the functional
The Euler–Lagrange equations are given by:
Remark. Starting from the property that 
is energy function
of the regular Lagrangian 
we will prove in the next chapter the following two
properties.
Theorem A. Along with the integral curves of the Euler–Lagrange equations
we have:
Theorem B. (Noether) For any infinitesimal symmetry
( 
const.) of the regular Lagrangian 
and for any 
-func-
tion 
the following function
is conserved along with the integral curves of the Euler–Lagrange equations

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
41
Proposition 2.4.1. The Euler–Lagrange equations (4.1) can be expressed in the
form
where 
is given by
Proof. The same calculus as in the previous section, taking
shows us that the equations (4.2) are equivalent to (4.3).
Remarking that the equations (4.3), (4.4) give the integral curve of the spray
The vector field S is called canonical spray of the space.
Proposition 2.4.2. The spray S of (4.5) is determined only by the fundamental
function F(x,y). Its integral curve are given by the equation (4.3), (4.4).
Consequently, we have:
Proposition 2.4.3. 
In a Finsler space 
the integral curves of the
canonical spray are the geodesies in canonical parametrization.
Indeed, the equations (3.5) of geodesics in the canonical parametrization are
coincident with the equations (4.3), (4.4).
Now, applying the theory from the section 4, ch.l, one can derive from the canoni-
cal spray S the notion of the nonlinear connection for the Finsler space
Definition 2.4.1. The nonlinear connection determined by the canonical spray 5
of the Finsler space 
is called Cartan nonlinear connection of the Finsler space
Theorem 2.4.1. The Cartan nonlinear connection N has the coefficients
It is globally defined on the manifold 
and depends only on the fundamental
function F(x,y).

42 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
From now on we will use only the adapted basis 
to the distributions
N and V, determined only by the Cartan nonlinear connection.
The coefficients of 
from (4.5)’ are 1–homogeneous functions with respect to
and have the properties
where
We have
Theorem 2.4.2.
1) The horizontal curves 
with respect to Cartan nonlinear connection
are characterized by the following system of differential equations:
2) The autoparallel curves of the Cartan nonlinear connection are characterized
by the system of differential equations:
2.5 Metrical Cartan connection
The famous metrical Cartan connection in a Finsler space 
can be
defined as an N–linear connection metrical with respect to the fundamental tensor
field 
and with h- and v-torsions vanish, N being Cartan nonlinear connection.
Indeed, we have:
Theorem 2.5.1. The following properties hold:
1) There exists a unique N –linear connection D on 
with coefficients
satisfying the following axioms:
Al D is h-metrical, i.e.
A2 D is v-metrical, i.e.
A3 D is h-torsion free, i.e.
A4 D is v-torsion free, i.e.

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
43
2) The coefficients 
are given by the generalized Christoffel
symbols:
3) D depends only on the fundamental function F of the Finsler space
The proof of the theorem is made by using the known techniques. It was initiated
by M. Matsumoto [88].
The connection 
from the previous theorem will be called the canonical
metrical Cartan connection.
Taking into account this theorem one can demonstrate without difficulties the fol-
lowing properties of the Finsler spaces endowed with the canonical Cartan nonlinear
connection and the canonical metrical Cartan connection.
Proposition 2.5.1. The deflection tensor field of the Cartan metrical connection
CT(N) satisfies the following equations:
Remark. If we consider the following Matsumoto’s system of axioms A1–A4 and
the axiom
we obtain the system of axioms which uniquely determined the Cartan metrical
connection 
Miron, Aikou, Hashiguchi proved the following result:
The Matsumoto’s axioms A1–A5 of the Cartan metrical connection 
are
independent.
Proposition 2.5.2. The following properties hold with respect to Cartan metrical
connection:
1.

44 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proposition 2.5.3. The Ricci identities of the metrical Cartan connection
are:
where the torsion tensors are:
and the curvature d-tensors are:
Hereafter we denote the metrical Cartan connection 
by 
or by
Let us consider the covariant d-tensors of curvature
Proposition 2.5.4. The covariant d-tensors of curvature satisfy the following i-
dentities:
Indeed, the last two identities are evident.
Applying the Ricci identities to the fundamental tensor 
and taking into ac-
count Theorem 2.5.1, we get the first three identities.
Proposition 2.5.5. The Cartan connection 
has the following properties:

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
45
where 
means the cyclic sum in the indices i,j,k..
Indeed, by applying the Ricci identities to the Liouville d-vector field 
and
looking at the tensor of deflection 
and 
we get the first iden-
tity (5.6). For the other identities, we will write the symplectic structure
in the form 
and write that its exterior differential vanishes,
2.6 Parallelism. Structure equations
Let 
be a metrical Cartan connection of the Finsler space 
The coefficients
of 
are given by the formula (5.1). As usually, the adapted basis
of Cartan nonlinear connection N and vertical connection V and the
dual adapted basis 
we can study the notion of parallelism of the vector
fields in Finsler geometry.
Let 
be a parametrized curve of the manifold TM and
be the tangent vector field along with the curve 
Then, we can write
As we know 
is horizontal curve with respect to the nonlinear connection N if
Also, 
is autoparallel curve of the nonlinear connection N if
We denote the tangent vector field along with 
by 
and taking
into account (6.1), we can set for the vector field X along with
is called the covariant differential along with the curve
Setting 
we get

46
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Let us consider
where 
are the 1-forms connection of D. Then the equation (6.3) can be written
in the form:
Definition 2.6.1. We say that the vector field X on TM is said to be parallel along
with the curve 
with respect to Cartan mectrical connection 
if
By means of (6.3), the equation
is equivalent with equations
From the formula (6.5), one obtains the following result:
Theorem 2.6.1. 
The vector field 
 is parallel along with the
parametrized curve 
with respect to the metrical Cartan connection if and only if
its coefficients 
are solutions of the linear system of the differential
equations
A theorem of the existence and uniqueness for the parallel vector field along with
a given curve on TM can be formulated.
A horizontal path of the metrical Cartan connection D on TM is a horizontal
parametrized curve 
with the property
Using (6.5) for 
and taking into account the previous theorem, we get:
Theorem 2.6.2. The horizontal paths of Cartan metrical connection in Finsler
space 
are characterized by the system of differential equations
If we describe the initial conditions of the previous system, we obtain the exis-
tence and uniqueness of the horizontal paths in the Finsler space

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
47
Now let us consider a curve 
in the fibre 
of TM. It can be represented
the equations:
The curve 
is called a vertical curve in the point
A vertical curve 
is called a vertical path with respect to metrical Cartan
connection 
if 
Now, applying equation (6.5), we have
Theorem 2.6.3. In the Finsler space 
the vertical paths in the point
with respect to metrical Cartan connection 
are characterized by the system of
differential equations
Now, taking into account the theory of structure equations of N–linear connec-
tion given in the section of chapter 1, we can apply it to the case of metrical Cartan
connection 
We get the following result:
Theorem 2.6.4. The structure equations of the Cartan metrical connection
are given by
where the 2-forms of torsion 
and 2-form of curvature 
are as follows:
Now, the Bianchi identities of the metrical Cartan connection 
can be
obtained from the system of exterior equations (6.8) by calculating the exterior dif-
ferential of (6.8), modulo of the same system (6.8) and using the exterior differential
of 2-forms 
and of 2-form of curvature
We obtain:

48 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 2.6.5. The Bianchi identities of the Cartan metrical connection
of Finsler spaces 
are as follows:
where 
means the interchange of the indices j, k and subtraction and 
means
the cyclic permutation of indices j,k,l and summation.
Remark. The structure equations given in Theorem 2.6.4 are extremely useful in
the theory of submanifolds of the Finsler manifold
2.7 Remarkable connections of Finsler spaces
Let us consider an N–linear connection D with the coefficients
To these coefficients we add the coefficients 
of the nonlinear connection and we
write D with the coefficients 
For metrical Cartan connection
we have the coefficients 
given by the formulae (4.5)’ and
(5.1).
To the metrical Cartan connection 
we associate the following
N–linear connections:

Ch.2. Finsler spaces

1° Berwald connection
2° Chern–Rund connection
3° Hashiguchi connection
These remarkable connections satisfy a commutative diagram:
obtained by means of connection transformations [113].
The properties of metrizability of those connections can be expressed by the
following table:
Remark. It is shown that the Chern connection (introduced in [25], [42]) can be
identified with the Rund connection (cf. M. Anastasiei [7]).
2.8 
Special Finsler manifolds
Berwald space is a class of Finsler spaces with geometrical properties similar to
those Riemann spaces. Based on the holonomy group of Berwald connection Z.
Szabo made a first classification of Berwald spaces. Other important classes of
special Finsler spaces are Landsberg spaces and locally Minkowski Finsler spaces.
In this section we briefly describe some of the main properties of these spaces.

50 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Definition 2.8.1. A Finsler space is called Berwald space if the connection coef-
ficients 
of the Berwald connection 
are function of position alone,
i.e.
We denote by 
a Berwald space.
The space 
can be characterized by the following tensor equation.
Theorem 2.8.1. A Finsler space is Berwald space if and only if
Proof. It is not difficult to prove that the Cartan connection
and Berwald connection 
are related by the formulae:
From here we obtain:
where
From the second expression of (5.5), we have
It follows that the condition 
is equivalent to
Eliminating the term 
from (8.3) and (8.4), we find
where we used

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
51
Permutating now the indices (ilj) in (8.5) and taking into account the identity
one obtain:
Contracting this by 
we obtain
which means 
So the equation (8.5) reduces to
On the other hand, in general, the hv–curvature tensor 
of 
can be written
as, [88]:
Taking into account of 
from (8.8) we obtain:
Hence, from (8.7), (8.9) we have
Conversely, from 
we obtain 
Therefore, (8.3) gives
and then 
i.e. 
q.e.d.
Corollary 2.8.1. A Finsler space is Berwald space if and only if the hv–curvature
tensor 
of 
vanishes identically.
Another important class of Finsler space is given by the Landsberg spaces [88]:
Definition 2.8.2. A Finsler space is called Landsberg space if its Berwald connection
is h–metrical, i.e.
where the index 0 means contraction by
Theorem 2.8.2. A Finsler space is Landsberg space if and only if the hv–curvature
tensor 
of Cartan connection 
vanishes identically.

52 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proof. From Proposition 2.5.6, a Landsberg space is characterized by 
In
general, from the equation 
we obtain
where we used the Ricci identity (5.3) and
Taking into account equation (8.8) and the above equation we obtain:
From (8.11), if 
hold good, then we obtain
Conversely, from the relation 
(cf. (5.6)), we can conclude the
assertion. 
q.e.d.
The following result is now immediate.
Corollary 2.8.2. If a Finsler space is Berwald space, then it is a Landsberg space.
The locally Minkowski Finsler space are introduced by the following definition.
Definition 2.8.3. A Finsler space 
is called locally Minkowski if in
every point 
there is a coordinate system 
such that on
its fundamental function F(x,y) depends only on directional variable 
Such a
coordinate system 
is called adapted to a locally Minkowski space.
Theorem 2.8.3. A Finsler space is locally Minkowski if and only if the covariant
tensor of curvature 
of the Cartan connection 
vanishes and the tensorial
equation 
holds.
Proof. In an adapted coordinate system, first two coefficients of the Cartan con-
nection 
are given by 
Hence from the definitions of 
and
taking into account of (5.4), (5.5), respectively, we obtain
Next, we see easily that under the adapted coordinate system
Conversely, if 
and 
from (5.6) and (8.8) we obtain
Hence from (8.8) we obtain 
Hence,
So,

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
53
the first equation of (5.5) reduces to
This implies Riemannian flatness. Hence there exists a coordinate system 
such
that 
from which
Consequently, from the axiom of h-metrizability, we obtain
from which we obtain 
q.e.d.
Since we have an example given by Antonelli of a locally Minkowski space [11],
that means:
On the paracompact manifolds there exists locally Minkowski Finsler spaces.
So, we obtain the following sequences of inclusions of special Finsler spaces:
where 
is the class of Landsberg spaces,
the class of the Berwald spaces, 
the
class of the locally Minkowski spaces, and 
the class of Riemannian spaces.
We remark that 
is the class of flat Riemannian spaces.
In 1978, Y. Ichijyo has shown the geometrical meaning of the vanishing hv–
curvature tensor using the holonomy mapping as follows:
Theorem 2.8.4. (Ichijyo) Let us assume that (M, F) is a connected Finsler space
with the Cartan connection 
Let p and q be two arbitrary points of M, and let
be any piecewise differentiable curve joining p and q. In order that the holonomy
mapping from 
to 
along with 
with respect to the nonlinear connection N,
be always a C–affine mapping, it is necessary and sufficient that the hv –curvature
tensor 
vanishes identically.
It still remain an open problem: If there exists Landsberg space with vanishing
hv–curvature tensor.
In [68], Y. Ichijyo introduced the following interesting fundamental function
where 
is a fundamental Finsler function, the function 
is 1–positively homo-
geneous in 
and 
are linearly independent differentiable
1–forms.
Definition 2.8.4. The Finsler metric (8.12) is called 1-form Finsler metric and the
space (M, F) is called 1-form Finsler space.
There are some special 1-form metrics:

54 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
1. Berwald–Móor metric:
which is a typical Minkowski metric
in a local coordinat system. G.S.Asanov introduced a more general form:
where 
are linearly independent 1-forms.
2. m–th root metric: 
which was studied by
Shimada [152] and Antonelli and Shimada [19] for the case
3. A special Randers metric: 
where k
is a constant. This example was given by Y. Ichijyo.
Using the Cartan connection, Matsumoto and Shimada proved the following
result for a 2-dimensional 1-form Finsler space [91]:
Theorem 2.8.5. If a 2-dimensional 1-form Finsler space is a Landsberg space, then
it is a Berwald space.
In order to introduce the notion of Douglas space, let us observe first that the
geodesies of a Finsler space 
can be written in the form:
where
Definition 2.8.5. A Finsler space 
is called Douglas space if the functions
are homogeneous polynomials in
of degree three.
This is equivalent to the fact that the Douglas tensors of 
vanishes. M.
Matsumoto and S. Bacso [23] proved:
Theorem 2.8.6. If a Landsberg space is a Douglas space, then it is a Berwald space.
Theorem 2.8.7. A Randers space 
is a Douglas space if and
only if the differential 1-form 
is a closed form.
We will describe in the sequel the Finsler spaces with constant curvature.
Definition 2.8.6. The quantity K(x,y, X) given by
is called the scalar curvature at (x, y) with respect to X, where 
is the h-curva-
ture tensor of the Berwald connection 
[88].

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
55
One can remark that the h-curvature tensor of the Berwald connection 
is
([88][p.ll8])
From Definition 2.8.6 it can be said that the scalar curvature K(x,y,X) is defined
as the sectional curvature of a 2-section spanned by y and X, with
and 
in general.
Definition 2.8.7. If the scalar curvature K for a Finsler space of scalar curvature
is a constant, the Finsler space is called a space of constant curvature K.
The following theorem is known ([88]):
Theorem 2.8.8. A Finsler space is of scalar curvature if and only if
where 
is the torsion tensor of the Cartan connection
The left hand of (8.14) is also called flag curvature:
The flag curvature is one of the important numerical invariants because it lies in
the second variation formula of arc length and takes the place of sectional curvature
from the Riemannian case.
In 1975 the following interesting result concerning scalar curvature was obtained:
Theorem 2.8.9. 
(Numata [129]) Let 
be a Berwald space of scalar
curvature K. 
Then 
is a Riemannian space of constant curvature or a locally
Minkowski space, according 
or 
respectively.
Lastly in this chapter we remark that Finsler spaces with
–metric were
studied in the paper [89]. And using the invariants of a Finsler space, was made
a classification of some Finsler spaces with 
-metric, namely Randers class,
Kropina class, Matsumoto class, etc. The classes are providing new concrete exam-
ples of 
–metrics.
2.9 
Almost Kählerian model of a Finsler mani-
fold
A Finsler space 
can be thought as an almost Kähler space on the
manifold 
called the geometrical model of the Finsler space

56 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
In this section we present the Sasaki–Matsumoto lift of the metric tensor 
of
the space 
and a new lift, given by R. Miron [109], which is homogeneous and
allows us to study problems concerning the global properties of the Finsler spaces.
In this way the theory of Finsler spaces gets more geometrical consistence.
If we consider the Cartan nonlinear connection 
of the Finsler space
then we can define an almost complex structure IF on TM by:
It is easy to see that IF is well defined on 
and it is determined only
by the fundamental function F of the Finsler space
Theorem 2.9.1.
The almost complex structure IF
is integrable if and only if the
h-coefficients 
of the torsion of 
vanishes.
Let 
be the dual basis of the adapted basis 
Then, the
Sasaki–Matsumoto lift of the fundamental tensor 
can be introduced as follows:
Consequently, G is a Riemannian metric on 
determined only by the fundamen-
tal function F of the Finsler space 
and the horizontal and vertical distributions
are orthogonal with respect to it.
The following results can be proved without difficulties, [113]:
Theorem2.9.2.
(i) The pair (G, IF) is an almost Hermitian structure on
(ii) The almost symplectic 2-form associated to the almost Hermitian structure
(G, IF) is
(iii) The space 
is an almost Kählerian space, constructed only
by means of the fundamental function F of the Finsler space
The space 
is called the almost Kählerian model of the Finsler
space
Theorem2.9.3. The N-linear connection D with the coefficients
of the Cartan connection is an almost Kählerian connection, i. e.:

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
57
Hence, the geometry of the almost Kählerian model  
can be studied by means
of Cartan connection of the Finsler space 
For instance, the Einstein equations
in 
are given by the Einstein equations in the previous model 
One can find
it in [113].
Remarking that the Sasaki–Matsumoto lift (9.2) is not homogeneous with re-
spect to 
a homogeneous lift to 
of the fundamental tensor field 
was
introduced by R. Miron in the paper [109].
We describe here this new lift for its theoretical and applicative interest.
Definition 2.9.1. We call the following tensor field on
the homogeneous lift to 
of the fundamental tensor field 
of a Finsler space
where a > 0 is a constant, imposed by applications (in order to preserve the
physical dimensions of the components of 
) and where 
is the square of the
norm of the Liouville vector field:
with
We obtain, without difficulties:
Theorem 2.9.4.
1° The pair 
is a Riemannian space.
2° 
is 0–homogeneous on the fibers of TM.
3° 
depends only on the fundamental function F (x, y) of the Finsler space
4° The distributions N and V are orthogonal with respect to
We shall write 
in the form
where

58 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Consequently, we can apply the theory of the (h, v)–Riemannian metric on TM
investigated by R. Miron and M. Anastasiei in the book [113].
The equation 
determines the so called indicatrix of the Finsler space
in the point
Therefore, we have:
Theorem 2.9.5. The homogeneous lift 
of the metric tensor 
coincides
with the Sasaki–Matsumoto lift of  
on the indicatrix 
for every
point
A linear connection D on 
is called a metrical N–connection, with respect
to 
if D 
and D preserves by parallelism the horizontal distribution N.
As we know,[113] there exist the metrical N–connection on
We represent a linear connection D, in the adapted basis, in the following form:
where 
are the coefficients of D.
Theorem 2.9.6. There exist the metrical N–connections D on 
with respect
to 
which depend only on the fundamental function F(x, y) of the Finsler space
One of them has the following coefficients
where 
is the Cartan connection of the Finsler space
is the Berwald connection and means the h–covariant derivation
with respect to
Of course, the structure equations of the previous connection can be written as
in the books [112], [113].
In order to study the Riemannian space 
it is important to express the
coefficients

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
59
To this aim, expressing in the adapted basis the conditions:
and using the torsions 
and 
of the Cartan connection 
we get by a
direct calculus:
Theorem 2.9.7. The Levi–Civita connection of the Riemannian metric 
have in
an adapted basis the following coefficients
The structure equations of the Levi–Civita connection (9.11) can be written in
the usual way.
Let us prove that the almost complex structure IF, defined by (9.1) does not
preserve the property of homogeneity of the vector fields. Indeed, it applies the
1–homogeneous vector fields 
onto the 0–homogeneous vector fields
We can eliminate this incovenient by defining a new kind of almost complex
structure 
setting:
Taking into account that the norm of the Liouville vector field 
and the Cartan
nonlinear connection N are defined on 
it is not difficult to prove:

60
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 2.9.8. The following properties hold:
1° 
is a tensor field of type (1.1) on
2°
3° 
depends only on the fundamental function F of the Finsler space
4° The 
–linear mapping 
preserves the property of
homogeneity of the vector fields form
It is important to know when 
is a complex structure.
Theorem 
2.9.9. 
is a complex structure on 
if and only if the Finsler space
has the following property:
Proof. The Nijenhuis tensor
vanishes if and only if the previous equations hold.
Remark. If 
is a Riemann space, the equation (9.13) is a necessary and sufficient
condition that it to be of constant sectional curvature.
The pair 
has remarkable properties:
Theorem 2.9.10. We have
1° 
is an almost Hermitian structure on 
and depend only on the fun-
damental function F of the Finsler space
2° The associated almost symplectic structure 
has the expression
where 
is the symplectic structure (9.3).
3° The following formula holds:

Ch.2. Finsler spaces 
61
4° Consequently, 
is a conformal almost Kählerian structure and we have
Remarks.
1° The previous theorem shows that 
is a special almost Hermitian struc-
ture.
2° There exist the linear connection compatible with the conformal almost Kä-
hlerian structure
The conformal almost Kählerian space 
is another geometrical model
of the Finsler space 
It is based on the homogeneous lift 
(9.5).
The previous considerations are important for study the Finslerian gauge theory,
[22], [177], and in general in the Geometry of Finsler space 
The importance of
such kind of lift was emphasized by G.S. Asanov [22]. Namely he proved that some
(h,v) metrics on 
satisfy the principle of the Post Newtonian calculus. The
metric 
belongs to this category, while Sasaki–Matsumoto lift has not this proper-
ty.
The theory of subspaces of Finsler spaces can be found in the books [112], [113].

Chapter 3
Lagrange spaces
The notion of Lagrange space was introduced and studied by J. Kern [76] and R.
Miron [96]. It was widely developed by the first author of the present monograph
[106], Since this notion includes that of Finsler space it is expected that the geometry
of these spaces to be more rich and applications in Mechanics or Physics to be more
important.
We will develop the geometry of Lagrange spaces, using the fundamental notions
from Analytical Mechanics as: integral of action, Euler–Lagrange equations, the law
of conservation of energy, Noether symmetries, etc. Remarking that the Euler–La-
grange equations determine the canonical spray of the space, we can construct all
geometry of Lagrange space by means of its canonical spray, following the methods
given in the Chapter 1. So the geometry of Lagrange space is a direct and natural
extension of the geometry of Finsler space.
At the end of this chapter, we emphasize the notion of generalized Lagrange
spaces, useful in the geometrical models for the Relativistic Optics.
3.1 
The notion of Lagrange space
At the begining we define the notions of differentiable Lagrangian using the mani-
folds TM and 
where M is a differentiable real manifold of dimension n.
Definition 3.1.1. A differentiable Lagrangian is a mapping
of class 
on manifold 
and continuous on the null section
of the projection
The Hessian of a differentiable Lagrangian L, with respect to 
has the ele-
ments:
63

64 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Exactly as in the Finsler case we prove that 
is a d–tensor field, covariant of
order 2, symmetric.
Definition 3.1.2. A differentiable Lagrangian L(x, y) is called regular if the fol-
lowing condition holds:
Now we can give:
Definition 3.1.3. A Lagrange space is a pair 
formed by a
smooth real n-dimensional manifold M and a regular Lagrangian L(x, y) for which
d-tensor 
has a constant signature over the manifold
For the Lagrange space 
we say that L(x,y) is fundamental
function and 
is fundamental (or metric) tensor. We will denote, as usually,
by 
the contravariant of the tensor
Examples.
1° The following Lagrangian from electrodynamics [112], [113]
where 
is a pseudo–Riemannian metric,
a covector field and U(x) a
smooth function, m, c, e being the known constants from Physics, determine a La-
grange space
More general:
2° The Lagrangian
where F(x, y) is the fundamental function of a Finsler space
is a covector field and U(x) a smooth function gives rise to a remarkable
Lagrange space, called the Almost Finsler–Lagrange space (shortly AFL–space).
In particular, 
the pair 
is a Lagrange
space.
In other words,
Proposition 3.1.1. Any Finsler space 
 is a Lagrange space
Conversely, any Lagrange space 
  for which fundamen-
tal function L(x, y) is positive and 2-homogeneous with respect to
and
is positive definite determine a Finsler space

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
65
The previous example proves that:
Theorem 3.1.1. If the base manifold M is paracompat then there exist regular
Lagrangians L(x, y) such that the pair 
is a Lagrange space.
3.2 
Variational problem Euler–Lagrange equa-
tions
The variational problem can be formulated for differentiable Lagrangians and can
be solved in the case when we consider the parametrized curves, even if the integral
of action depends on the parametrization of the considered curve.
Let 
be a differentiable Lagrangian and
a curve (with a fixed parametrization) having the image in the domain of a
chart U on the manifold M. The curve c can be extended to 
as
Since the vector field 
vanishes nowhere, the image of the mapping
c* belongs to
The integral of action of the Lagrangian L on the curve c is given by the func-
tional
Consider the curves
which have the same end points 
as the curve c, 
being
a regular vector field on the curve c, with the property 
and 
a
real number, sufficiently small in absolute value, so that
The extension of curves 
to 
is given by
The integral of action of the Lagrangian L on the curve 
is given by

66 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
A necessary condition for I(c) to be an extremal value of 
is
Under our condition of differentiability, the operator 
is permuting with operator
of integration.
From (2.2)' we obtain
A straightforward calculus leads to:
Substituting in (2.4) and taking into account the fact that 
is arbitrary, we
obtain the following.
Theorem 3.2.1. In order that the functional I(c) be an extremal value of 
it
is necessary that c be the solution of the Euler–Lagrange equations:
Some important properties of the Euler–Lagrange equations can be done.
Introducing the notion of energy of the Lagrangian L(x, y), by:
we can prove the so called theorem of conservation of energy:
Theorem 3.2.2. 
The energy
of the Lagrangian L is conserved along to every
integral curve c of the Euler–Lagrange equation
Indeed, along to the integral curve of the equations 
we
have:

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
67
Consequently, we have 
q.e.d.
Remark. A theorem of Noether type for the Lagrangian L(x, y) can be found in
the book [106].
3.3 Canonical semispray. Nonlinear connection
A Lagrange space 
determines an important nonlinear connection
which depends only on the fundamental function L(x, y). Remarking that
from (2.5) is a d–covector and that the fundamental tensor of the space, 
is
nondegenerate we can establish:
Theorem 3.3.1. If
 
is a Lagrange space then the system of differential
equations
can be written in the form:
where
Indeed, the formula
holds. Hence (3.1) is equivalent to (3.1)' , 
being expressed in (3.2).
Theorem 3.3.2. 
The differential equation (3.1)' gives the integral curves of the
semi–spray
where 
are expressed in (3.2).

68 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Indeed, the differential equations (3.1)' do have a geometrical meaning and there-
fore it follows that 
are the coefficients of a semispray S from (3.3). The integral
curves of S are given by
hence the differential equations (3.1)' are satisfied. 
q.e.d.
The previous semispray is determined only by the fundamental function L(x, y)
of the space 
It will be called canonical semispray of Lagrange space
Corollary 3.3.1. The integral curves of the Euler–Lagrange equations
are the integral curves of the canonical semispray S from (3.3).
Indeed, we can apply Theorems 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 to get the announced property.
As we know, (Ch.1), a semispray S determines a nonlinear connection. Applying
Theorem 1.4.3, we obtain:
Theorem 3.3.3. In a Lagrange space 
there exists the nonlinear con-
nections which depend on the fundamental function L. One of them has the coeffi-
cients
Proposition 3.3.1. The nonlinear connection N with coefficients 
is in-
variant with respect to the Carathéodory transformations
where 
is an arbitrary smooth function.
Indeed, we have 
So,
determine the same canonical spray with 
Thus, the previous theo-
rem shows that the Carathéodory transformation (3.5) does not change the nonlinear
connection N.
Because the coefficients of N are expressed by means of the fundamental func-
tion L, we say that N is a canonical nonlinear connection of the Lagrange space

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
69
Example. The Lagrange space of electrodynamics,
being given by (1.3), with 
has the coefficients 
of the canonical
semispray S, of the form:
where 
are the Christoffel symbols of the metric tensor 
of
the space 
and 
is the electromagnetic tensor
Therefore, the integral curves of the Euler–Lagrange equation are given by solution
curves of the Lorentz equations:
The canonical nonlinear connection of 
has the coefficients (3.4) of the form
It is remarkable that the coefficients 
of the canonical nonlinear connection N of
the Lagrange spaces of electrodynamics are linear with respect to 
This fact has
some consequences:
1° The Berwald connection of the space, 
has the coefficients
2° The solution curves of the Euler–Lagrange equation and the autoparallel curves
of the canonical nonlinear connection N are given by the Lorentz equation
(3.8).
In the end part of this section, we underline the following theorem:
Theorem 3.3.4. The autoparallel curves of the canonical nonlinear connection N
are given by the following system of differential equations:
where 
is expressed in (3.4).
This results from Section 3, Ch.1.

70 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
3.4 Hamilton–Jacobi equations
Let us consider a Lagrange space 
and 
its canonical non-
linear connection. The adapted basis 
to the horizontal distribution N
and the vertical distribution V has the vector fields
Its dual is 
with
The momenta 
of the space 
can be defined by
Thus 
is a d–covector field. We can consider the following forms
Proposition 3.4.1. The forms 
and are globally defined on 
and we have
Proof. 1° Indeed, 
and 
from (4.4) do not depend on the transformation of
local coordinates on
Because of a direct calculus shows that
Theorem 3.4.1. The 2–form 
 from (4.4), determines on 
a symplectic struc-
ture, which depends only on the fundamental function L(x,y) of the space

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
71
Proof. Using the previous proposition results that  
is integrable, i.e. 
and
q.e.d.
Corollary 3.4.1. The triple 
is a Lagrangian system.
The energy 
of the space 
is given by (2.6), Ch.3. Denoting
we get from (2.6), Ch.3:
But, along the integral curve of the Euler–Lagrange equations we have
And from (4.6), we have also
So, we obtain:
Theorem 3.4.2. Along to the integral curves of Euler–Lagrange equations we have
the Hamilton–Jacobi equations
Corollary 3.4.2. 
The energy 
is conserved along to every integral curve of the
Hamilton–Jacobi equations.
3.5 The structures 
and 
of the Lagrange space
The canonical nonlinear connection N determines some global structures on the
manifold 
One of them is the almost product structure 
It is given by the
difference of the projectors h and v
It follows

72 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 3.5.1. The canonical nonlinear connection N of the Lagrange space
determines an almost product structures 
which depends only on
the Lagrangian L(x, y). The eigensubspace of 
corresponding to the eigenvalue  –1
is the vertical distribution V and eigensubspace of 
corresponding to the eigenvalue
+1 is the horizontal distribution N.
Conform to a general result, we get from Ch.1.
Theorem 3.5.2. The almost product structure 
determined by the canonical non-
linear connection N is integrable if and only if the horizontal distribution N is
integrable.
This condition is expressed by the equations
where
Proof. It is not difficult to see that the Nijenhuis tensor of the structure 
vanishes
if and only if 
Taking 
in the adapted basis we have that
hold iff 
But 
is a d-tensor field, so the
condition 
is verified on the manifold 
q.e.d.
On the manifold 
there exists another important structure defined by the
canonical nonlinear connection N: It is the almost complex structure, given by the
-linear mapping
or by tensor field
It follows:
Theorem 3.5.3. We have:
1° 
is an almost complex structure globally defined on themanifold

3.6 
The almost Kählerian model of the space
Following the construction of the almost Kählerian model from geometry of Fin-
sler space, we extend for Lagrange spaces the almost Hermitian structure
determined by the lift of Sasaki type 
of the fundamental tensor field 
and by
the almost complex structure
The metric tensor 
of the space 
and its canonical
nonlinear connection 
allows to introduce a pseudo–Riemannian structure
on the manifold 
given by the following lift of Sasaki type:
We have:
Theorem 3.6.1.
1° 
is a pseudo–Riemannian structure on the manifold 
determined only by
the fundamental function L(x, y).

For the pair 
we get:

the fundamental function L(x, y).
2° The almost symplectic structure associated to the pair 
is given by (4.4),
i.e.
3° The space 
is almost Kählerian.
Proof. 1° is evident. 
from (6.1) and 
from (5.5) depend only on L(x,y) and

hold.
2° Calculating in the adapted basis 
we obtain (6.2).
3° Taking into account Theorem 3.4.1, it follows that  
is a symplectic structure.
q.e.d.
The space 
is called almost Kahlerian model of the Lagrange
space
We can use it to study the geometry of Lagrange space 
For instance, the
Einstein equations of the Riemannian space 
can be considered as ”the
Einstein equations” of the space
G.S. Asanov showed [22] that the metric 
given by the lift (6.1) does not satisfy
the principle of the Post–Newtonian calculus. This fact is because the two terms of
has not the same phyisical dimensions. This is the reason to introduce a new lift
[109] which can be used in a gauge theory.
Let us consider the scalar field:
It is determined only by L(x, y). We assume 
As in the case of Finsler
geometry (cf. Ch.2), the following lift of the fundamental tensor field

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
75
where a > 0 is a constant, imposed by applications in theoretical Physics. This is
to preserve the physical dimensions of the both members of
Let us consider also the tensor field on
and 2–form
where 
is given by (6.2).
As in the Finslerian case we can prove:
Theorem 3.6.3. We have
1° The pair 
is an almost Hermitian structure on 
depending only on
the fundamental function L(x, y).
2° The almost symplectic structure 
associated to the structure 
is given
by the formula (6.5).
3° 
being conformal to symplectic structure 
the pair 
is conformal almost
Kählerian structure.
We can remark now that the conformal almost Kählerian space
can be used for applications in gauge theories which implies the notion of the regular
Lagrangian.
3.7
Metrical N–linear connections
Now applying the methods exposed in the first chapter, we will determine some
metrical connections compatible with the Riemannian metric 
determined by the
formula (6.1). Such kind of metrical connection will give the metrical N–linear
connections for the Lagrange space 
These connections depend only on the fun-
damental function L(x, y) and this is the reason for the N–metrical connection to
be called canonical.
Applying the theory of N–linear connection from Chapter 1, one proves without
difficulties the following theorem:
Theorem 3.7.1. On the manifold 
there exists the linear connection D which
satisfy the axioms:

76 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
1° D is metrical connection with respect to 
i.e.
2° D preserves by parallelism the horizontal distribution of the canonical
nonlinear connection N.
3° The almost tangent structure J is absolute parallel with respect to D, i.e.,
From this theorem it follows that we have 
and the h–component
and v–component 
have the properties
Moreover,
Consequently, D is an N–linear connection and has two coefficients
which verify the following tensorial equations:
where 
is the h (v)–covariant derivative with respect to 
respectively. And
conversely, if an N–linear connection with the coefficients 
verifies
the properties (7.3), at (7.4) then it is metrical with respect to 
i.e. the equations
(7.2) are verified.
But if (7.2) are verified then the equation 
is verified also. So we can
refer the (7.4). We shall determine the general solution 
of the tensorial
equations (7.4). First of all we prove
Theorem 3.7.2.
1° There exists only one N–linear connection 
which verifies
the following axioms:
N is canonical nonlinear connection of the space
(it is h-metrical).
(it is v-metrical).
(it is h-torsion free),
(it is v-torsion free).

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
77
2° The coefficients 
and 
are expressed by the following generalized Chris-
toffel symbols:
3° This connection depends only on the fundamental function L(x, y) if the La-
grange space
This theorem can be provided in the usual way (see [113]). And this metrical
N–linear connection will be called canonical and will be denoted by
Similar as in the case of Finsler spaces one can determine all N–linear connections
which satisfy only the axioms 
from the previous theorem.
Now we can study the geometry of Lagrange space 
by means of canonical
metrical connection or by the general metrical connections which satisfy the axioms
In this respect we can determine as in the Finsler geometry, the structure
equations of the metrical N–linear connection
Moreover, Ricci identities and
Bianchi identities can be written in the usual manner.
Therefore, by means of 
Ch. 1, the connection 1-forms 
of the canonical
metrical N–connection 
are
where 
are given in (7.5).
Theorem 3.7.3. The connection 1-forms 
of the canonical metrical N–connection
satisfy the following structure equations
and
where the 2-forms of torsion 
are as follows

78 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
and the 2-forms of curvature 
are
the d–tensors of curvature 
and d-tensor of torsion 
having
the known expression (see Ch.1, 5).
We notice that starting from the canonical metrical connection
other remarkable connections like the connection of Berwald
Chern–Rund
and Hashiguchi 
have the coefficients
respectively. The following commutative diagram holds.
The corresponding transformations of connections from this diagram may be
easily deduced from the Finslerian case.
Some properties of the canonical metrical connection 
are given by
Proposition 3.7.1. We have:
1° 
is totally symmetric.
2°
3° The covariant curvature d-tensors 
(with
etc.) are skew-symmetric in the first two indices.
4°
These properties can be proved using the property 
 where 
is the sym-
plectic structure (6.2), the Ricci identities applied to the fundamental tensor 
of
the space and the equations
By the same methods we can study the metrical N–linear connections
which satisfy the axioms 
and have a priori given d-tensors
of torsion 
and

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
79
Theorem 3.7.4.
1° There exists only one N–linear 
connection which satis-
fies the following axioms:
N is canonical nonlinear connection of the space
( 
is h-metrical).
( 
is v-metrical).
The h-tensor of torsion 
is apriori given.
The v-tensor of torsion 
is apriori given.
2° The coefficients 
and 
of the previous connection are as follows
being the coefficients of canonical metrical N–connection
The proof is similar with that of Theorem 3.7.2.
From now on 
will be denoted simply by
Proposition 3.7.2. The Ricci identities of the metrical N–connection 
are
given by:
Indeed, we can apply Proposition 1.8.1.
Of course, the previous identities can be extended to a d-tensor field of type (r, s)
on the ordinary way.
Denoting
we have the h-deflection tensor field 
and v-deflection tensor field
The tensors 
and 
have the known expressions:
Applying the Ricci identities (7.12) to the Liouville vector field 
we obtain:

If     
 is a metrical N–linear connection then the following
identities hold
We will apply the previous theory in next section, taking into account the ca-
nonical metrical N–connection 
and taking 
Of course, a
theory of parallelism of vector field with respect to the connection 
can be
done taking into account the considerations from 
Ch.1.

Gravitational and electromagnetic fields
Let us consider a Lagrange space 
endowed with the canonical
metrical N–connection
The covariant deflection tensors

can be introduced by
Obviously we have

Theorem 3.8.1. The covariant deflection tensor fields 
and
of the canonical
metrical N–connection

Some considerations from the Lagrange theory of electrodynamics, lead us to
introduce:

are called h- and v-electromagnetic tensor field of the Lagrange spaces 
respec-
tively.

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces

Proposition 3.8.1. With respect to the canonical metrical N–connection
the v-electromagnetic tensor 
vanishes.
The Bianchi identities of 
and the identities (8.2) lead the following im-
portant result.

is a Finsler space 
then 
and equations (8.4)
simplifies.
2° If the canonical nonlinear connection N is flat, i.e. the distribution N is
integrable, 
and the previous equations have a simple form.
If we put

then we can prove:

Remark. The electromagnetic tensor field 
and the Maxwell equations were
introduced by R. Miron and M. Radivoiovici, [113]. Important contributions have
M. Anastasiei, K. Buchner, 
(see Ref. from the book [113]).
The curvature d-tensors of the connection 
have the
following Ricci and scalar curvatures

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Let us denote by 
the components in the adapted basis
of the energy momentum tensor.
Using the almost Kählerian model 
of the Lagrange space and
taking into account the canonical metrical connection 
(see Theorem 3.7.2)
we obtain[113]:
Theorem 3.8.4.
1° The Einstein equations of the almost Kählerian space 
(n > 2), endowed
with the canonical metrical connection 
are the following
where k is a real constant.
2° The energy momentum tensors 
and 
satisfy the following laws of con-
servation
The physical background of the previous theory was discussed by S. Ikeda in the
last chapter of the book [112]. All this theory is very simple if the Lagrange spaces
have the property
Corollary 3.8.1. If the canonical metrical connection 
has the property
then we have
1° For n > 2, the Einstein equations of the Lagrange space 
have the form:
2° The following laws of conservation hold:
In the next section, we apply this theory for the Lagrangian of Electrodynamics.

The Lagrange space of electrodynamics
The Lagrange spaces 
with the Lagrangian from Electrodynamics
which is obtained from the Lagrangian L(x, y), (1.3) for 
is a very good
example in our theory. It was studied in the book [113]. We emphasized here only
the main results. The space
with the fundamental function (9.1) is called the
Lagrange space of electrodynamics.
The fundamental tensor of the space 
is
and its contravariant is
The canonical spray of the space 
is given by the differential equations
where
and
Let us denote
The canonical nonlinear connection N has the coefficients
As we remarked already we have:
Theorem 3.9.1. The autoparallel curve of the canonical nonlinear connection (9.4)
are the solutions of the Lorentz equations

84 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
The canonical metrical connection 
has the coefficients
It follows that the curvature d-tensors are
where 
is the curvature tensor of the Levi–Civita connection
The covariant deflection tensors are
Proposition 3.9.1. The h- and v-electromagnetic tensor field of the Lagrange space
of electrodynamics are
Consequently, the v-covariant derivative of the tensor 
vanishes. We obtain
Theorem 3.9.2. The generalized Maxwell equations (8.4) of the Lagrange space of
electrodynamics reduce to the classical ones.
Since 
implies 
and 
 implies 
we
get from Corollary 3.8.1.
Theorem 3.9.3. The Einstein equations (8.10) in 
reduce to the classical Ein-
stein equations associated to the Levi–Civita connection.
3.10 Generalized Lagrange spaces
The generalized Lagrange spaces were introduced by the first author, [95], and then
was studied by many collaborators (see [113]). The applications in the general
Relativity or in the relativistic optics was treated too [115].
A detailed study of these spaces one finds in the books [113].
In this section we give a short introduction in the geometrical theory of gene-
ralized Lagrange spaces, since they will be considered in the geometry of Hamilton
spaces.
Definition 3.10.1. A generalized Lagrange space is a pair
where 
is a d-tensor field on the manifold 
covariant, symmetric, of rank
n and of constant signature on

Ch.3. Lagrange spaces 
85
is called fundamental tensor or metric tensor of the space
Evidently, any Lagrange space 
is a generalized Lagrange space,
whose fundamental tensor field is 
But not any generalized Lagrange
space 
is a Lagrange space.
Definition 3.10.2. We say that 
with fundamental tensor field 
is
reducible to a Lagrange space if the system of partial differential equations
has solutions with respect to L(x, y).
In order to a space 
be reducible to a Lagrange space is necessary that the
d-tensor field 
be totally symmetric. So we have
Proposition 3.10.1. A generalized Lagrange space 
for which
the tensor field 
is not totally symmetric is not reducible to a Lagrange space.
Example 1. The space 
with
with nonvanishing d-covector field 
and 
a Riemannian metric is not re-
ducible to a Lagrange space.
This example is strongly related to the axioms of Ehlers–Pirani–Schield and
theory Tavakol–Miron, from General Relativity [121]. This example was also studied
by Watanabe S., Ikeda, S. and Ikeda, F. [171].
Example 2. The space 
with the fundamental tensor field
where 
is a Riemann or Lorentz metric tensor, 
and 
is
a refractive index, is not reducible to a Lagrange space.
This metric was introduced in Relativistic Optics by J.L. Synge [156]. It was
intensively studied by R. Miron and his collaborators [113], [115].

86 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
These two examples show that the nonlinear connection with the coefficients
being Christoffel symbols of the metric tensor 
can be associated to
the fundamental tensor 
of the space 
But, generally, we cannot derive a
nonlinear connection N from the fundamental tensor
So, we adopt the following postulate:
The generalized Lagrange space 
is endowed with an a priori
given nonlinear connection N.
In this situation, we can develop the geometry of the pair 
by using the
same methods as in the case of Lagrange space
For instance, considering the adapted basis 
 to N and V, respectively,
we can prove:
Theorem 3.10.1.
1° For a generalized Lagrange space endowed with a nonlinear connection N,
there exists a unique N–linear connection 
satisfying the
following axioms:
 2° 
has the coefficients given by the generalized Christoffel symbols:
For more details we send the reader to the books [113].
Let us end this chapter with the following important remark. The class of Rie-
mannian spaces 
is a subclass of the Finsler spaces 
and this is a subclass of
the class of the Lagrange spaces 
Moreover, the class of Lagrange spaces 
is
a subclass of the generalized Lagrange spaces 
Hence, we have the following
inclusions:
This sequence of inclusions is important in applications to the geometric models in
Mechanics, Physics, Biology, etc., [18].

Chapter 4
The geometry of cotangent
bundle
The geometrical theory of cotangent bundle (T*M, 
M) of a real, finite dimen-
sional manifold M is important in the differential geometry. Correlated with that of
tangent bundle (TM, 
M) we get a framework for construction of geometrical mod-
els for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics, as well as, for the duality between
them – via Legendre transformation.
The total space T*M can be studied by the same methods as the total space
of tangent bundle TM. But there exist some specific geometric objects on T*M.
For instance the Liouville–Hamilton vector 
Liouville 1-form 
the canonical
symplectic structure and the canonical Poisson structure. These properties are fun-
damental for introducing the notions of Hamilton space or Cartan space.
In this chapter we study some fundamental object fields on T*M: nonlinear
connections, N-linear connections, structure equations and their properties. We
preserve the convention that all geometrical objects on T*M or mappings defined
on T*M are of
4.1 The bundle (T*M, 
M)
Let M be a real n-dimensional differentiable manifold and let (T*M, 
M) be its
cotangent bundle [175]. If 
is a local coordinate system on a domain U of a chart
on M, the induced system of coordinates on 
are
The coordinates 
are called ” momentum variables”.

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
A change of coordinate on T*M is given by
Therefore the natural frame 
are transformed by (1.1) in the form
Looking at the second formula (1.2) the following notation can be adopted
Indeed (1.2) gives us:
The natural coframe 
is changed by (1.1) by the rule:
The Jacobian matrix of change of coordinate (1.1) is
It follows
We get:
Theorem 4.1.1. The manifold T*M is orientable.
Like in the case of tangent bundle, we can prove:

Ch.4. The geometry of cotangent bundle 
89
Theorem 4.1.2. If the base manifold M is paracompact, then the manifold T*M
is paracompact, too.
The kernel of the differential 
of the natural projection
is the vertical subbundle VT*M of the tangent bundle TT*M.
Associating to each point 
the fibre 
of VT*M we obtain the vertical
distribution:
This distribution is locally generated by the tangent vector field 
So it is
an integrable distribution, of local dimension n.
Noticing the formulae (1.2) and (1.2)' we can introduce the following geometrical
object fields:
Theorem 4.1.3. The following properties hold:
1° 
is a vertical vector field globally defined on T*M.
2° The forms 
and 
are globally defined on T*M.
3°

Proof. 1°. By means of (1.1) and (1.3)' it follows that 
belongs to the distribution

and 
do not depend on the changes of coordinates on T*M.
3°. 
  is a closed 2-form on T*M and
will be called the Liouville–Hamilton vector field on T*M,
is called the
Liouville 1-form and 
is the canonical symplectic structure on T*M.
The pair (T*M, ) is a symplectic manifold.
4.2 The Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian sys-
tems
Let us consider the Poisson bracket { , } on T*M, defined by

90 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proposition 4.2.1. We have
Proof. By means of (1.1), (1.2), 
and
Therefore we deduce

 Consequently, 
q.e.d.
Theorem 4.2.1. The Poisson bracket { , } has the properties
1°
2° { f , g } is R-linear in every argument
3°
4°
By a straightforward calculus, using (2.1), l°–4° can be proved. Therefore { , }
is called the canonical Poisson structure on T*M. The pair ( 
{ , }) is a
Lie algebra, called Poisson–Lie algebra.
The relation between the structures 
and { , } can be given by means of the
notion of Hamiltonian system.
Definition 4.2.1. 
A differentiable Hamiltonian is a function
which is of class 
on 
and continuous on the zero section
of the projection
Definition 4.2.2. A Hamiltonian system is a triple (T*M, 
H) formed by the
manifold T*M, canonical symplectic structure 
and a differentiable Hamiltonian
H.

Let us consider the

vectors and covectors fields on T*M, respectively.
Thus, the following 
mapping:

mapping and bijective, because

We can apply this property to prove:
Theorem 4.2.2. The following properties of the Hamiltonian system (T*M, 
H)
hold:
1° There exists a unique vector field 
having the property

are given by the Hamilton–Jacobi
equations:

Corollary 4.2.1. The function H(x, p) is constant along the integral curves of the
Hamilton vector field
Indeed,
The structures 
and { , } have a fundamental property given by the theorem:
Theorem 4.2.3. The following formula holds:
Proof. From (2.6)' we deduce
q.e.d.
Corollary 4.2.2. The Hamilton–Jacobi equations can be written in the form
One knows, [167], the Jacobi method of integration of Hamilton–Jacobi equations
(2.5). Namely, we look for a solution curve 
in T*M, of the form
where
Substituting in (2.5), we have

Ch.4. The geometry of cotangent bundle 
93
It follows
Consequently, 
which is called the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
(of Mechanics). If integrated, it defines S and 
is obtained by the integration of
the first equation (*).
Remarks.
1° In the next chapter we will define the notion of Hamilton space
H being a differentiable regular Hamiltonian and we shall see that the Legen-
dre mapping between the Hamilton space 
and a Lagrange spce
(M, L(x,y)) sent the Euler–Lagrange equations into the Hamilton–Jacobi e-
quations. This idea is basic for considering the notion of 
[66], [67],
[105].
2° The Poisson bracket { , } is also basic for quantization. The quantization of
a Mechanical system is a process which associates operators on some Hilbert
space with the real functions on the manifold T*M (phase space), such as
the commutator of two such operators is associated with Poisson bracket of
functions (Abraham and Marsden [3], [167]).
4.3 Homogeneity
The notion of homogeneity, with respect to the momentum variables 
of a func-
tion 
can be studied by the same way as the homogeneity of functions
defined on the manifold TM (see Ch.l, §2).
Let 
be the group of homotheties on the fibres of T*M:
The orbit of a point 
by 
is given by
The tangent vector at the point 
is the Liouville–Hamilton vector field
A function 
differentiable on 
and continuous on the zero
section is called homogeneous of degree r, 
with respect to the variables
(or on the fibres of T*M), if

94 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
This is
Exactly as in the case of the homogeneity of the function f : 
one can
prove:
Theorem 4.3.1. A function f : 
differentiable on 
and continuous
on the zero section of 
is r-homogeneous with respect to 
if and
only if we have
where 
is the Lie derivation with respect to the Liouville–Hamilton vector field
But (3.2) can be written in the form
A vector field 
is r-homogeneous with respect to 
if
It follows :
Theorem 4.3.2. A vector field 
is r-homogeneous if and only if we
have:
Evidently,
Consequently:
1° 
are 1– and 0–homogeneous with respect to
2° If

f X is 
homogeneous.
3° A vector field X given in the natural frame by

is r-homogeneous with respect to 
if and only if 
are 
homogeneous
and 
are r-homogeneous with respect to

is 1-homogeneous.
5° If X is r-homogeneous vector field on T*M and f is a function, s-homogeneous,
then X f is 
-homogeneous function.
6° 
are 
homogeneous and 
are 
homogeneous, if f is s-ho-
mogeneous.
A q-form 
is called s-homogeneous with respect to 
(or on the
fibres of T*M) if:
All properties given in Ch. 1, §2, for q-forms defined on the tangent manifold
TM, concerning their homogeneity are valid in the case of q-forms from
We get:
Theorem 4.3.3. A q-form 
on T*M is s-homogeneous on the fibres of T*M if
and only if
Consequences.
1° 
s- respectively s'-homogeneous, imply

2° 
s-homogeneous and 
r-homogeneous vector fields de-
termine the function

3° 
are 0- respectively 1-homogeneous.
4° The Liouville 1-form 
is 1-homogeneous.
5° The canonical symplectic structure 
is 1-homogeneous.
The previous consideratiosn will be applied especially, in the study of Cartan spaces.

4.4 
Nonlinear connections
On the manifold T*M there exists a remarkable distribution V :
As we know V is integrable, having the adapted basis 
and it is
of local dimension n.
Definition 4.4.1. A nonlinear connection on T*M is a differentiable distribution
N : 
: 
 which is supplementary to the vertical distribution
V, i.e.:
Consequently, the local dimension of the distribution N is
N will be called also the horizontal distribution.
If N is given, there are uniquely determined a system of functions 
in
every domain of a local chart 
such that the adapted basis to the distribution
N has the form
The functions 
are called the coefficients of the nonlinear connection N.
Theorem 4.4.1. A change of coordinate (1.2) on T*M transforms the coefficients
of a nonlinear connection N by the rule:
Conversely, a system of functions 
defined on each domain of local chart
from T*M, which verifies (4.3) with respect to (1.1), determines a nonlinear con-
nection.
Proof. By means of (1.1), (1.2), it follows from (4.2) the formula (4.3). Therefore,
generate a distribution N, which is supplementary to the vertical
distribution V, V being generated by 
q.e.d.

Now we can give a necessary and sufficient condition for the integrability of the

P. Antonelli and D. Hrimiuc in the paper [14] and will be studied in a next chapter
of this book.
Let us consider a Riemannian (or metrical) structure 
on the manifold T* M.
The following property is evident:     uniquely determines an orthogonal distribu-

given by the geometry of the manifold T* M.
If a tensor 
covariant, symmetric and positively defined on T* M and a
nonlinear connection N with coefficients 
are given, then we can consider
the following Riemannian structure on T* M:

It follows that the addition of d-tensors and tensor product of them lead to the
d-tensor fields. So, the set (1, 
) generates the algebra of d-tensors over the ring
of functions
Other examples 
are d-covector and d-vector fields, respectively.
Clearly, with respect to (1.1) the coefficients 
of a d-tensor fields are
transformed by the classical rule:
the notion of N-linear connection can be defined in the known manner (see Ch.l).
In the following we assume N is a symmetric nonlinear connection.

its coefficients of Levi-
Civita connection. Then

In the adapted basis 
the Ricci identities (8.8), using the operators ”|” and

Etc.
Proposition 4.10.1. The following formule hold:

The proof can be given by a direct calculus, using the formula (8.5) and the
equations (8.6).
As usually, we extend the Ricci identities for any d-tensor field, given by (7.2).
For instance, if

with respect
to N-linear connection 
are
In particular, if the N-linear connection

of the system of differential equation (5.9), i.e.
Definition 4.11.2. An horizontal path of an N-linear connection D is a horizontal
autoparallel curve with respect to D.
Theorem 4.11.4. The horizontal paths of an N-linear connection D are characte-
rized by the system of differential equations:
Indeed, the equations (11.13) and 
lead to (11.14).
A parametrized curve 
is called vertical in the point

Chapter 5
Hamilton spaces
Based of the conception of classical mechanics, the notion of Hamilton space was
defined and investigated by R. Miron in the papers [97], [101], [105]. It was studied
by D. Hrimiuc and H.Shimada [63], [66] et al.
The geometry of Hamilton spaces can be studied using the geometrical method
of that of cotangent bundle. On the other hand, it can be derived from the geometry
of Lagrange spaces via Legendre transformation, using the notion of –duality.
In this chapter, we study the geometry of Hamilton spaces, combining these two
methods and systematically using the geometrical theory of cotangent bundle.
We start with the notion of generalized Hamilton space. And then we detect
from its geometry the theory of Hamilton spaces.
5.1 
The spaces
Definition 5.1.1. A generalized Hamilton space is a pair
where M is a real n–dimensional manifold and 
is a d-tensor field of type
(2,0) symmetric, nondegenerate and of constant signature on
The tensor 
is called as usual the fundamental (or metric) tensor of the space
In the case when the manifold M is paracompact, then there exist metric tensors
positively defined such that 
is a generalized Hamilton space.
Definition 5.1.2. A generalized Hamilton space 
is called
reducible to a Hamilton one if there exists a Hamilton function H(x, p) on T*M
such that

Let us consider the d-tensor field
In a similar manner in the case of generalized Lagrange spaces (cf. Ch.3) we can
prove:
Proposition 5.1.1. A necessary condition that a generalized Hamilton space be
reducible to a Hamilton one is that the d-tensor 
be totally symmetric.
Theorem 5.1.1. 
Let 
be the fundamental tensor of a space 
0-ho-
mogeneous. Thus a necessary and sufficient condition that 
be reducible to a
Hamilton space is that the d-tensor field 
be totally symmetric.
Indeed, in this case the Hamilton function 
satisfies the
conditions imposed by Definition 5.1.2.
Remarks.
1. The definition of Hamilton spaces is given in a next section of this chapter.
2. Let 
be a Riemann metric tensor. It is not difficult to prove that the
space 
with the fundamental tensor
is not reducible to a Hamilton space.
The covariant tensor 
determined by 
is obtained from the equations
Let us consider the following tensor field:
Proposition 5.1.2. 
The d-tensor 
gives the v-coefficients of a v-covariant
derivation with the property:
The proof can be obtained easily.
We use the coefficients (1.4) in the theory of metrical connections with respect
to the fundamental tensor

5.2
N–metrical connections in
In general, we cannot determine a nonlinear connection from the fundamental tensor
of the space 
Therefore we study the N-linear connections compatible with
N being a priori given (cf. Ch.4).
If the nonlinear connection N has the coefficients 
then an adapted basis
to the horizontal distribution N and vertical distribution V on T*M is of the form
And an N-linear connection D has the coefficients
Definition 5.2.1. An N-linear connection 
is called metrical with respect
to the fundamental tensor 
of the space 
if:
In the case when 
is positively defined we obtain the geometrical meaning of
the conditions (2.2). In this respect we can consider ”the length” of a d-covector
given by 
as follows
We can prove without difficulties the followings:
Theorem 5.2.1. An N-linear connection 
is metrical with respect to the
fundamental tensor 
of the space 
if, and only if, along any smooth curve
and for any parallel d-covector field 
i.e., 
we have
Using the condition (1.3), the tensorial equations (2.2) are equivalent to:
Now, by the same methods as in Ch.3 we can prove a very important theorem.
We have:
Theorem 5.2.2. 1) There exist an unique N-linear connection
having the properties:
1° The nonlinear connection N is a priori given.
2° 
is metrical with respect to the fundamental tensor
of the space

3° The torisons 
and

2) The previous connection has the v-coefficients 
from (1.4) and the h-coef-
ficients 
expressed by
For a generalized Hamilton space 
Obata’s operators [113] can
be defined:
We can prove:

is given by
where 
is from (1.4), (2.3) and 
are arbitrary d-tensor
fields.
It is important to remark that the mappings 
determined by
(2.5) and the compsotion of these mappings is an Abelian group.
From the previous theorem, we deduce:
Theorem 5.2.4. There exist an unique metrical N-linear connection
with respect to the fundamental tensor 
having a priori given torsion
d-tensor fields 
The coefficients of 
have the
following expressions:
Moreover, if we denote 
etc. and apply to fundamental tensor
the Ricci identities taking into account the equations (2.2) we obtain:
Proposition 5.2.1. For any metrical N–linear connections 
with respect to
the fundamental tensor 
of the space 
the following identities hold:

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
123
The expressions of the curvature tensors are given in the formulae (10.3), Ch.4.
The notions of parallelism, horizontal or vertical paths, as well as the structure e-
quations for an metrical N-linear connection with respect to the fundamental tensor
can be studied, using the results obtained in the last section of Chapter 4.
5.3 
The N–lift of
Let 
be a generalized Hamilton space and 
an apriori given
non–linear connection on the manifold T*M. Thus 
from (2.1) is an adapted
basis to the distributions N and V. Its dual 
basis is expressed by the
1-forms 
and by
Definition 5.3.1. The N-lift of the fundamental tensor 
is:
Theorem 5.3.1. We have:
1° The N-lift 
is a tensor field of type (0,2) on 
symmetric, 
nonsingular
depending only on 
and on the nonlinear connection N.
2° The pair 
is a pseudo–Riemannian space.
3° The distributions N and V are orthogonal with respect to
Indeed, every term from (3.2) is defined on 
and is a tensor field. In the
adapted basis (2.1) the tensor field 
has the components
It follows that 
is symmetric, nondegenerate of type (0,2) tensor field. Obviously
we have 
q.e.d.
Now, assuming that the nonlinear connection 
is symmetric, i.e.
we consider the 
–linear mapping 
defined
in (6.7), Ch.4

is globally defined on T*M.
2°
is the tensor field
3° 
is an almost complex structure determined by the fundamental tensor
and by the nonlinear connection N.
4° The pair 
is an almost Hermitian structure determined only by 
and
N.
5° The associated almost symplectic structure to 
is the canonical symplec-
tic structure
It follows that the space 
is almost Kählerian. It is called the
almost Kählerian model of the generalized Hamilton space
5.4 Hamilton spaces
A Hamilton space 
is a particular case of a generalized Hamil-
ton space 
in the sense that the fundamental tensor derived from a
regular Hamilton function
Since the triple 
forms a Hamiltonian system, we can apply the theory
from Chapter 4.
Definition 5.4.1. A Hamilton space is a pair 
where M is a real
n-dimensional manifold and H is a function on T*M having the properties:
1° 
is differentiable on the manifold 
and
it is continuous on the null section of
2° The Hessian of H (with respect to the momenta 
), given by the matrix
is nondegenerate:
3° The d-tensor field 
has constant signature on

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
125
Of course, 
from (4.1) is a d-tensor field, cf. 
Ch.4. It is called the fun-
damental tensor, or metric tensor of the space 
and the Hamilton
function H is called the fundamental function for
From the previous definition we obtain:
Theorem 5.4.1. Every Hamilton space 
is a generalized Hamilton
space.
Indeed, 
where 
is given by (4.1), is a generalized Hamilton
space.
The converse is not true (see Proposition 5.1.1).
Theorem 5.4.2. If the base manifold is paracompact, then there exists a Hamilton
function H on T*M, such that 
is a Hamilton space.
Indeed, M being a paracompact manifold, let 
be a Riemannian metric
tensor on M. Then we can consider the Hamilton function on T*M:
where 
and c is speed light. The properties l°–3° from the last definition can
be proved directly. 
q.e.d.
Let us consider the canonical symplectic structure 
on T*M:
By means of  Definition 4.2.2, we obtain that the triple 
where H is
the fundamental function of a Hamilton space 
form a Hamilton system. Thus
the mapping 
defined by (2.2), Ch.4, 
is an
isomorphism. Applying the Theorem 4.2.2 we obtain:
Theorem 5.4.3. For any Hamilton space 
the following proper-
ties hold:
1° There exists a unique vector field 
with the property:
2° The integral curves of the vector field 
are given by the Hamilton–Jacobi
equations:

126 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Indeed, from (2.6)', the Hamilton vector field 
can be written as:
Also, we have:
Corollary 5.4.1. The fundamental function H(x, p) of the space 
is constant
along the integral curve of the Hamilton vector field
Now it is easy to observe that the following formula holds:
Therefore, by means of Poisson brackets, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations can be
written in the form:
We remark that the Jacobi method of integration of Hamilton–Jacobi equations,
mentioned in 
Ch.4, works in the present case as well.
One of the important d-tensor field derived from the fundamental function H of
the Hamilton space 
is:
Proposition 5.4.1. We have:
1° The d-tensor field 
is totally symmetric.
2° 
vanishes, if and only if the fundamental tensor field 
does not
depend on the momenta
Let us consider the coefficients 
from (1.4) of the v-covariant derivation.
From (4.7) it follows
Of course, these coefficients have the properties
In the next section we will use the functions 
as the v-coefficients of the
canonical metrical connection of the space

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces

5.5 
Canonical nonlinear connection of the space
An important problem is to determine a nonlinear connection 
for a Hamilton
space 
depending on the fundamental function H, only.
A method for finding a nonlinear connection with the mentioned property was
given by R. Miron in the paper [97]. This consists in the transformation of the
canonical nonlinear connection N of a Lagrange space 
via Le-
gendre transformation: Leg : 
into the canonical nonlinear connection of
the Hamilton space 
This method will be developed in the Chapter 7, using the
notion of -duality between the spaces 
and
Here, we give the following result of R. Miron, without demonstration, which
can be found in 
of Chapter 7.
We have:
Theorem 5.5.1.
1° The following set of functions
determines the coefficients of a nonlinear connection N of the Hamilton space
2° The nonlinear connection with the coefficients 
depends only on the fun-
damental function H of the Hamilton space
The brackets { } from (5.1) are the Poisson brackets (2.1), Ch.4.
Indeed, by a straightforward computation, it follows that, under a coordinate
change on the total space of cotangent bundle 
from (5.1) obeys the rule of
transformation (4.3), Ch.4. Hence, the point 1° of Theorem 5.5.1 is verified. Taking
into account the expressions of the coefficients 
given in (5.1), the property 2°
is also evident.
The previous nonlinear connection will be called canonical.
Remark. If the fundamental function H(x, p) of the space 
is globally defined
on T*M, then the canonical nonlinear connection has the same property.
Proposition 5.5.1. The canonical nonlinear connection N of the Hamilton space
has the following properties

128 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
where 
is given by (4.12), Ch.4.
Proof. 1° The proof follows directly by (5.1); 2° is a consequence of the formula
(4.12), Ch.4. 
q.e.d.
Taking into account the fact that the canonical nonlinear connection N is a
regular distribution on 
with the property:
it follows that 
is an adapted basis to the direct decomposition (5.4), where
The dual basis of 
is 
where
Therefore, we can apply the theory of N-metrical connection expounded in 
of the
present chapter for study the canonical case.
5.6 
The canonical metrical connection of Hamil-
ton space
Let us consider the N-linear connections 
with the property
that N is the canonical nonlinear connection with the coefficients (5.1). It can be
studied by means of theory presented in
Consequently, we have:
Theorem 5.6.1. 1) In a Hamilton space 
there exists a unique
N–linear connection 
verifying the axioms:
1°  N is the canonical nonlinear connection.
2° The fundamental tensor 
is h-covariant constant
3° The tensor 
is v-covariant constant, i.e.
4° 
is h-torsion free, i.e.

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
129
5° 
is v-torsion free, i.e.
2) The connection 
has its coefficients 
given by (5.1) and
by the following generalized Christoffel symbols:
3) This connection depends only on the fundamental function H of the Hamilton
space
The proof of this theorem follows the ordinary way.
A such kind of connection, determined only by the fundamental function H is
called canonical and is denoted by 
or by
Now we can repeat Theorems 5.2.3 and 5.2.4, using the canonical metrical con-
nection
Proposition 5.6.1. The Ricci identities, with respect to the canonical connection
are given by
where the d-tensors of torsion are 
and
respectively, and the d-tensors of curvature of 
are given by (10.3), Ch.4.
The Ricci identities can be extended as usual to any d-tensor field.
For instance, in the case of a d-tensor field 
we have
Applying the identities (6.4)' to the fundamental tensor 
of the Hamilton space
we obtain

130 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proposition 5.6.2. The canonical connection 
has the properties (2.7), i.e.
The Ricci identities applied to the Liouville–Hamilton vector field 
lead
to some important identities.
Proposition 5.6.3. The canonical metrical connection 
of the Hamilton space
satisfies the following identities
where 
and 
are the deflections tensors of
are given by (9.9), Ch.4.
The canonical metrical connection 
is of Cartan type if 
From
(6.7) we obtain the following
Proposition 5.6.4. If the canonical metrical connection of the space 
is of
Cartan type, then the identities (10.8), Ch. 4, hold good.
Applying again the Ricci identities to the fundamental function H of the Hamil-
ton space 
we obtain:
Proposition 5.6.5. The following identities hold:
5.7 Structure equations of 
Bianchi iden-
tities
For the canonical connection 
the 1-form of connection 
are
given by (11.6), Ch.4:

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
131
The structure equations of 
are given by Theorem 4.12.1. In this case, we
have:
Theorem 5.7.1. The canonial metrical connection 
of the Hamilton space
= (M, H) has the following structure equations
where 
are the 2-forms of torsion:
and where 
are the 2-forms of curvature:
The previous theorem is very useful in the geometry of Hamilton spaces and
especially in the theory of subspaces of Hamilton spaces.
We can now derive the Bianchi identities of the canonical metrical connection
taking the exterior differential of the system of equations (7.2), modulo the
same system.
We obtain a particular case of Theorem 4.12.2:
Theorem 5.7.2. The canonical metrical connection 
of the Hamilton space
satisfies the Bianchi identities(12.4)–(12.8), Ch.4, with
5.8 Parallelism. Horizontal and vertical paths
The notion of parallelism of vector fields in the Hamilton spaces
endowed with the canonical metrical connection 
can be stud-
ied as an application of the theory presented in 
Chapter 4.
Let 
be a parametrized curve with the analytical expression
Then it results

132 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
where
Here 
are the coefficients (5.1) of the canonical nonlinear connection. We say
that the curve 
is horizontal if
For a vector field X on 
given in adapted basis by
along of the curve 
we have the covariant differential D of 
of the form (11.7),
Ch.4:
where 
are 1-forms connection of
It follows:
Theorem 5.8.1. The vector field 
is parallel along the parametrized
curve 
with respect to the canonical metrical connection 
if and only if its
coordinates 
and 
are solutions of the differential equations (11.8), Ch.4, where
are the 1-forms connection of
In particular, (see Theorem 4.11.2), we have:
Theorem 5.8.2. 
The Hamilton space 
endowed with the canonical
metrical connection 
is with absolute parallelism of vectors if and only if the
d-curvature tensors of 
and 
respectively vanish.
We say that the curve 
is autoparallel with respect to 
if
Taking into account Theorem 4.11.3, we have
Theorem 5.8.3. A curve 
is autoparallel with respect to the canonical
metrical connection 
if and only if the functions 
are the so-
lutions of the system of differential equations (11.13), Ch. 4, in which 
are the
1-forms connection of
By means of Definition 4.11.2, a horizontal path of the canonical metrical connec-
tion 
of Hamilton space 
is a horizontal autoparallel curve. Theorem 4.11.4
gives us:

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
133
Theorem 5.8.4. The horizontal paths of the Hamilton space 
endowed with
the canonial metrical connection 
are characterized by the system of differential
equations:
We recall that 
is a vertical curve in the point
if 
Hence, its analytical representation in local coordinates is of the form
Thus, a vertical path in the point 
is a vertical curve 
in the point 
which
is autoparallel with respect to
Theorem 4.11.5 leads to:
Theorem 5.8.5. The vertical paths in the point 
with respect to the canonical
metrical connection 
of the Hamilton space 
are characterized by
the system of differential equations
In next section we apply these results in some important particular cases.
5.9 
The Hamilton spaces of electrodynamics
Let us consider some important examples of Hamilton spaces.
1) Gravitational field
The Lagrangian of gravitational field 
(see Ch.3) is transformed,
via Legendre transformation ,in the regular Hamiltonian
Therefore the pair 
is a Hamilton space. Its fundamental tensor field
is given by

134 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
It follows that 
is a Hamiltonian system. Using Theorem 4.2.2, we
obtain
Proposition 5.9.1. The Hamilton–Jacobi equations of the space 
with the fun-
damental function (9.1), are:
Let us denote 
the Christoffel symbols of the metric tensor 
we
obtain:
Proposition 5.9.2. 
The canonical nonlinear connection N of the space
(M, H), (9.1)  has the following coefficients
Indeed, the coefficients 
are given by the formula (5.1). Therefore (9.4) holds.
Proposition 5.9.3. The canonical metrial connection of the Hamilton space
has the coefficients
Now we can apply to this case the whole theory from the previous sections of
this chapter.
2) The Hamilton space of electrodynamics
The Lagrangian of electrodynamics (9.1), Ch.3, is transformed via Legendre
transformation in the following regular Hamiltonian
where 
have the meanings from (9.1), e is the charge of test body,
is the vector–potential of an electromagnetic field, and
The first thing to remark is:
Proposition 5.9.4. The pair 
(9.6) is an Hamilton space.

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
135
Indeed, a direct calculus leads to the d-tensor
This is the fundamental tensor the space 
Its covariant is 
 The
Hamilton–Jacobi equations, (2.2), Ch.4, can be easily written.
The velocity field of this space can be written:
And the canonical nonlinear connection is given by
Proposition 5.9.5. The canonical nonlinear connection of the space 
with the
Hamiltonian (9.6) has the following coefficients:
where
Indeed, to prove the formula (9.9) we apply the formula (5.1) to the fundamental
function (9.6).
Now, remarking that 
we get:
Proposition 5.9.6. The canonical metrical connection 
of the Hamilton space
with the fundamental function H(x, p) with the Hamiltonian (9.6), has the fol-
lowing coefficients:
These geometrical object fields: 
allow to develop the
geometry of the Hamilton space of electrodynamic.
3) In the case when we take into account the Lagrangian
where U(x) is a force function, applying Legendre mapping we get the following
Hamiltonian

136 
The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
It follows
Proposition 5.9.7. The pair 
with the Hamiltonian (9.10) is a Ha-
milton space, having the fundamental tensor field:
We can prove also:
Proposition 5.9.8. The canonical nonlinear connection of the space 
(9.10)
has the coefficients
Proposition 5.9.9. The canonical metrical connection of the space 
(9.10), has
the coefficients
Now the previous theory of this chapter can be applied to the Hamilton space
(9.10).
5.10 
The almost Kählerian model of an Hamil-
ton space
Let 
be a Hamilton space and 
its fundamental tensor
field.
The canonical nonlinear connection N has the coefficients (5.1). The adapted
basis to the distributions N and V is 
and its dual basis
sis
Thus the following tensor on
gives a pseudo-Riemannian structure on 
which depends only on the fun-
damental function H(x, p) of the Hamilton space 
These properties are the

Ch.5. Hamilton spaces 
137
consequences of Theorem 5.3.1 and of the fact that 
is the canonical nonlinear
connection.
The tensor 
is called the N-lift of the fundamental tensor
The distributions N and V are orthogonal with respect to 
because the for-
mulae (3.3) hold.
Taking into account the mapping 
defined in (3.4) with
respect to the canonical nonlinear connection, we obtain the following properties:
1° 
is globally defined on
2° 
is an almost complex structure: 
on
3° 
is determined only by the fundamental function H(x, p) of the Hamilton
space
Finally, we obtain a particular form of Theorem 5.3.2:
Theorem 5.10.1.
1° The pair 
is an almost Hermitian structure on the manifold
2° The structure 
is determined only by the fundamental function H(x, p)
of the Hamilton space
3° The associated almost symplectic structure to 
is the canonical symplec-
tic structure
4° The space 
is almost Kählerian.
The proof is similar with that from Lagrange spaces (cf. Ch.3).
The equality 
 follows from the fact
that the torsion 
 of the canonical nonlinear connection vanishes
(cf (5.1)).
The space 
is called the almost Kählerian model of the Hamilton
space 
This model is useful in applications.

Chapter 6
Cartan spaces
The modern formulation of the notion of Cartan spaces is due of the first author [97],
[98], [99]. Based on the studies of E. Cartan, A. Kawaguchi [75], H. Rund [139], R.
Miron [98], [99], D. Hrimiuc and H.Shimada [66], [67], P.L. Antonelli [21], etc., the
geometry of Cartan spaces is today an important chapter of differential geometry.
In the previous chapter we have presented the geometrical theory of Hamilton
spaces 
In particular, if the fundamental function H(x,p) is
2-homogeneous on the fibres of the cotangent bundle (T*M, 
M) the notion of
Cartan space is obtained. It is remarkable that these spaces appear as dual of the
Finsler spaces, via Legendre transformation. Using this duality several important
results in the Cartan spaces can be obtained: the canonical nonlinear connection, the
canonical metrical connection etc. Therefore, the theory of Cartan spaces has the
same symmetry and beauty like Finsler geometry. Moreover, it gives a geometrical
framework for the Hamiltonian theory of Mechanics or Physical fields.
6.1 
The notion of Cartan space
As usually, we consider a real, n-dimensional smooth manifold M, the cotangent
bundle (T*M, 
M) and the manifold
Definition 6.1.1. A Cartan space is a pair 
such that the fol-
lowing axioms hold:
1° K is a real function on T*M, differentiable on 
and continuous on the
null section of the projection
2° K is positive on T*M.
3° K is positively 1-homogeneous with respect to the momenta
4° The Hessian of 
with elements
139

140
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
is positive-defined.
It follows that 
is a symmetric and nonsingular d-tensor field, contravari-
ant of order 2. Hence we have
The functions 
are 0–homogeneous with respect to the momenta
For a Cartan space 
the function K is called the fundamental
function and 
the fundamental or metric tensor.
At the beginning we remark:
Theorem 6.1.1 If the base manifold M is paracompact, then on the manifold T*M
there exist functions K such that the pair (M, K) is a Cartan space.
Indeed, if M is paracompact, then T*M is paracompact too. Let 
be a
Riemann structure on M. Considering the function
we obtain a fundamental function for a Cartan space
Examples.
1. Let (M, 
) be a Riemannian manifold and
Assuming 
on an open set 
it follows that
are the fundamental functions of Cartan spaces.
The first one, (1.4), is called Randers metric and the second one, (1.4)´, is called
the Kropina metric. They will be studied in Chapter 7.
Remark. More generally, we can consider the Cartan spaces with 
–metric.
They are given by the definition 6.1.1, with 
being
a function 1-homogeneous with respect to 
and

Ch.6. Cartan spaces 
141
2. The pair 
where
in the preferential charts of an atlas on T*M, is a Cartan space.
The function
and K(p) from (1.5) is the so–called Antonelli ecological metric [11].
A general remark is imporant:
Theorem 6.1.2. 
Every Cartan space 
uniquely determines a
Hamilton space:
Indeed, by means of the axioms l°–4° from Definition 6.1.1 it follows that the
pair (M, 
) is a Hamilton space.
We can apply the theory from previous chapter. So, considering the canonical
symplectic structure 
on T*M:
we deduce that the triple (T*M, 
) is a Hamiltonian system. We can apply
Theorems 4.4.3 and 5.4.3. Therefore we can formulate:
Theorem 6.1.3. For any Cartan space 
the following properties
hold:
1° There exists a unique vector field 
with the property
2° The integral curves of the Hamilton vector field 
are given by the Hamil-
ton–Jacobi equations
Indeed, 
is of the form
and (1.8) gives us its integral curves.
Corollary 6.1.1. The function
is constant along the integral curves of Hamilton
vector field
The Hamilton–Jacobi equations (1.8) of the Cartan space 
are fundamental
for the geometry of 
They are the dual of the Euler–Lagrange equations of the
Finsler space. Therefore (1.8) are called the equations of geodesies of the Cartan
space 
This theory will be developed in the next chapter.

Properties of the fundamental function K of
Cartan space
Proposition 6.2.1. The following properties hold:
1° 
is 1-homogeneous d-vector field on
2° 
is 0-homogeneous d-tensor field.
3° 
is (–1)-homogeneous, symmetric d-tensor field.
Indeed, if f(x,p) is r-homogeneous with respect of 
then 
is r – 1–
homogeneous.  Therefore l°–3° follows.  Let  gij be the covariant tensor of gij, i.e.:
Proposition 6.2.2. We have the following formulae:
These formulae are consequences of l°-3° from the previous proposition.
The fundamental tensor 
depends only on the point 
if
and only if 
In this case the pair (M, 
) is a Riemannian space. So
we have
Proposition 6.2.3. The Cartan space 
is Riemannian if, and
only if, the d–tensor field 
vanished.
Indeed,
holds, if and only if
Let us consider the coefficients 
from (1.4), Ch.5, of the v-covariant deriva-
tion. They are given by (4.8) Ch.5 for a Cartan space, i.e.:
Naturally, these coefficients have the following properties:
Other properties of the fundamental function K of the Cartan space 
will be
expressed by means of the canonical nonlinear connection and canonical metrical
connection.

6.3 
Canonical nonlinear connection of a Cartan
space
Since the Cartan space 
is Hamilton space 
 the canonical
nonlinear connection of the space 
has the coefficients 
from (5.1), Ch.5.
If we consider the Christoffel symbols of 
 given by
then the following contractions by 
or
lead us to
Theorem 6.3.1.  (Miron [98], [99]) The canonical nonlinear connection of the Car-
tan space 
is given by the following coefficients
Proof. By means of formula (5.1), with 
and 
we obtain
But 
The two last equations imply the formula (3.3). 
q.e.d.
Remark. The coefficients (3.3) can be obtained from the coefficients of the Cartan
nonlinear connection of a Finsler spaces by means of the so called 
–duality (see
Ch.7).
Let us consider the adapted basis 
to the distributions N and V where
N is determined by the canonical nonlinear connection of the Cartan space 
Its
dual basis is
Then the d-tensor of integrability of N is (4.12), Ch.4:
By a direct calculus we have:

144
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proposition 6.3.1. In a Cartan space 
the following properties hold:
Proposition 6.3.2. The distribution N determined by the canonical nonlinear con-
nection of a Cartan space 
is integrable if and only if the d-tensor field
vanishes.
Other consequence of the previous theorem is given by
Proposition 6.3.3. 
The canonical nonlinear connection of the Cartan space
depends only on the fundamental function K.
6.4 The canonical metrical connection
Let us consider the N-linear connection 
of the Cartan space
in which N is the canonical nonlinear connection, with the coeffi-
cients 
from (3.3). The h- and v-covariant derivatives of the fundamental tensor
of the space 
are expressed by
In particular, in the case of Cartan spaces, Theorem 6.6.1 implies:
Theorem 6.4.1. 1) In a Cartan space 
there exists a unique
N-linear connection 
verifying the axioms:
1° N is the canonical nonlinear connection of th espace
2° The equation 
holds with respect to
3° The equation 
holds with respect to
4°
is h-torsion free:
5° 
is v-torsion free:

Ch.6. Cartan spaces 
  145
2) The connection 
has the coefficients given by the generalized Christoffel
symbols:
3) 
depends only on the fundamental function K of the Cartan space
The connection 
from the previous theorem will be called the canonical
metrical connection of the Cartan space
The connection 
is called metrical since the conditions
hold good. But these two conditions have a geometrical meaning.
Let us consider ”the square of the norm” of a d-covector field 
on
and a parametrized curve 
 given in a local chart of 
 by
We have the folowing
Theorem 6.4.2. 
An N-linear connection 
on 
has
the property 
along any curve c, and for any parallel covector field
on c, if and only if the following equations 
hold.
Proof.
But
Or, the curve c being arbitrary we get
Conversely, if 
then 
and (*) imply
q.e.d.
We will denote 
by 
pointed out all
coefficients of the canonical metrical connection.
The first property of 
is as follows:

146
    The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proposition 6.4.1.  The coefficients
of the canonical metrical con-
nection 
are homogeneous with respect to momenta 
of degree 1,0, –1, respec-
tively.
Indeed, 
are 0–homogeneous imply 
are 0-homogeneous, 
are 1-homoge-
neous and, using (3.3), it results 
are 1-homogeneous etc.
Proposition 6.4.2. The canonical metrical connection 
of the Cartan space
is of Cartan type. Namely its deflection tensors have the property
Proof.  First of all we remark that the h-coefficients            of        give us
But 
can be calculated from (3.3). We obtain 
Therefore
Similarly, 
q.e.d.
The first equality (4.4) is an important one. It can be substituted with the axiom

Let us consider the following N-linear connections of

Now, it follows easily.
Proposition 6.6.2. The following diagram holds good
The existence of this commutative diagram shows us that the N-linear connec-
tions 
and
are important in the geometry of Cartan
spaces.

The Berwald connection 
of the Cartan spaces has d-tensors of
the torsion:
and
The d-tensors of curvature of 
are:
where
are the coefficients of the 
–connection.
The Bianchi identities of the Berwald connection 
are given by Theorem
4.12.2.
Now, let us give the following definition:

Ch.6. Cartan spaces 
153
Definition 6.7.1. A Cartan space 
 is called Berwald–Cartan space if the coeffi-
cients 
of Berwald connection 
are functions of position alone:
The Berwald–Cartan spaces can be characterized by:
Theorem 6.7.1. A Cartan space is a Berwald–Cartan space if and only if the
following tensor equation holds:
The proof is similar with the one of Theorem 2.3.1.
From the formula (7.1) we obtain:
Corollary 6.7.1. A Cartan space is a Berwald–Cartan space if and only if the
d-tensor of curvature 
vanishes.
Definition 6.7.2. A Cartan space is called a Landsberg–Cartan space if its Berwald
connection is h-metrical, i.e.
Theorem 6.7.2. A Cartan space is a Landsberg–Cartan space if and only if the
following tensor equation holds:
As in the case of Landsberg–Finsler space we can prove:
Theorem 6.7.3. A Cartan space is a Landsberg–Cartan space if and only if the
d-curvature tensor 
of the canonical metrical connection 
vanishes iden-
tically.
Corollary 6.7.2. If a Cartan space is a Berwald–Cartan space, then it is a Landsberg–
Cartan space.
Remark. We will study again these spaces, in next chapter using the theory of
duality of Finsler spaces and Cartan spaces. Also, it will be introduced the Cartan
space of scalar and constant curvature.
Definition 6.7.3. A Cartan space 
is called locally Minkowski–
Cartan space if in every point 
there is a coordinate system 
 such that

the fundamental function K(x,p) depends only on the momenta
Exactly as in the case of Finsler spaces we can proof the following important
result:
Theorem 6.7.4. A Cartan space 
is a locally Minkowski–Cartan
space if and only if the d-tensor of curvature 
of the canonical metrical connec-
tion 
vanishes and
Examples.
1° The Cartan spaces 
where K is given by (1.5), is a locally
Minkowski–Cartan space.
2° The Cartan spaces 
with the fundamental function (Berwald–
Moór)
is a locally Minkowski–Cartan space.
6.8 Parallelism in Cartan space. Horizontal and
vertical paths
In a Cartan space 
endowed with the canonical metrical connection
the notion of parallelism of vector fields along a curve
can be studied using the associate Hamilton space
(cf.§5.8, Ch.5).
Let 
be a parametrized curve expressed in a local chart of
by
The tangent vector field 
is
where

Ch.6. Cartan spaces 
  155
The curve 
is called horizontal if 
So, an horizontal curve 
is
characterized by the equations:
Taking into account that 
it follows that:
Proposition 6.8.1. The horizontal curves 
in the Cartan space 
are characte-
rized by the equations:
The first consequence is follows:
Theorem 6.8.1. The geodesies of the Cartan space 
are the horizontal curves.
Proof. The geodesies of the space 
are given by the Hamilton–Jacobi equations
Therefore, we have 
q.e.d.
Corollary 6.8.1. The geodesies of the space 
are characterized by the equations:
For a vector field 
which is locally expressed by:
we have:
Theorem 6.8.2. The vector field X, given by (8.7) is parallel along the curve
with respect to the canonical metrical connection 
of the Cartan space 
if and
only if its coordinate 
are solutions of the differential equations (11.8), Ch.4,
where 
is the 1-forms connection of
In particular, Theorem 4.11.2 can be applied:

156                                                           The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 6.8.3. 
The Cartan space 
endowed with the canonical
metrical connection 
is with the absolute parallelism of vectors, if and only if the
d-tensors of curvature 
and 
vanish.
Theorem 4.11.3 can be particularized, too:
Theorem 6.8.4. 
The curve 
given by (8.1) is autoparallel with respect to the
canonical metrical connection 
of the Cartan space 
if, and only if, the func-
tions 
are the solutions of the system of differential equations
As is known, the horizontal autoparallel curves of the Cartan space 
are the
horizontal paths.
Theorem 6.8.5. The horizontal paths of the connection 
of a Cartan space are
characterized by the system of differential equations
Now, taking into account Theorem 4.11.5, we get:
Theorem 6.8.6. The vertical paths in the point 
with respect of a Cartan
space 
are characterized by the system of differential equations
6.9  The almost Kählerian model of a Cartan space
To a Cartan space Cn = (M, K (x,p)) we can associate some important geometrical
object fields on the manifold           .   Namely, the N-lift
of the fundamental tensor
the almost complex structure 
etc. If N is the canonical nonlinear connection
of 
thus 
determine an almost Hermitian structure, which is derivated only
from the fundamental function K of the Cartan space. This structure gives us the
so-called [99] geometrical model on 
of the Cartan space
Let 
be the adapted basis to the distribution N and V, N being the cano-
nical nonlinear connection of the space 
Its dual basis is
The N-lift of the fundamental tensor field 
 of the space 
 is defined by
We obtainas usual

Theorem 6.9.1. The following properties hold:
1° 
is a Riemannian structure globally defined on
2°     is determined only by the fundamental function K of the Cartan space
3° The distributions N and V are orthogonal.
Now, considering the covector fields 
in every point 
we can
define the 
–linear mapping 
defined in (6.7),
Ch.4, by
By means of Theorem 4.6.2, we obtain
Theorem 6.9.2. We have the followings:
1° 
is globally defined on
2° 
is the tensor field of type (1,1) :
3° 
is an almost complex structure on
4° 
depends only on the fundamental function K of the Cartan space
Theorem 4.6.4 lead to
Theorem 6.9.3.
1° The pair 
is an almost Hermitian structure on
2° The almost Hermitian structure 
depends only on the fundamental func-
tion K of the Cartans space
3° The associate almost symplectic structure to the structure 
is the cano-
nical symplectic structure
Corollary 6.9.1. The space 
is almost Kählerian and it is determined
only by the Cartan space
Finally, we remark:

158 
    The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 6.9.4. The N -linear connection D, determined by the canonical metrical
connection 
of the Cartan space 
is an almost Kählerian one, i. e.
Due to the last property, we call the space 
the almost Kählerian
model of the Cartan space
It is extremely useful in the applications in mechanics, theoretical physics, etc.

Chapter 7
The duality between Lagrange
and Hamilton spaces
In this chapter we develop the concept of    –duality between Lagrange and Hamilton
spaces (particularly between Finsler and Cartan spaces) investigated in [66], [67],
[97] and a new technique in the study of the geometry of these spaces is elaborated.
We will apply this technique to study the geometry of Kropina spaces (especially the
geometric objects derived from the Cartan Connection) via the geometry of Randers
spaces.
These spaces are already used in many applications.
7.1 
The Lagrange-Hamilton 
duality
Let L be a regular Lagrangian on a domain 
and let H be a regular
Hamiltonian on a domain
Hence, the matrices with entries
and
are everywhere nondegenerate on D and respectively D*,
Note: The metric tensors (1.1) and (1.2) used in this chapter are those of Chapter
3 and Chapter 5 multiplied by a factor 2. This notation allows us to simplify a certain
number of equations and to preserve the classical Legendre duality encounterd in
Mechanics (see[3]).

If 
is a differentiable map, we can consider the fiber derivative of L,
locally given by
which will be called the Legendre transformation.
It is easily seen that L is a regular Lagrangian if and only if 
is a local diffeo-
morphism [3].
In the same manner if 
the fiber derivative is given locally by
which is a local diffeomorphism if and only if H is regular.
Let us consider a regular Lagrangian L. Then 
is a diffeomorphism between
the open sets 
and 
We can define in this case the function
where 
is the solution of the equations
Also, if H is a regular Hamiltonian on M, 
is a diffeomorphism between same
open sets 
and 
and we can consider the function
where 
is the solution of the equations
It is easily verified that H and L given by (1.5) and (1.6) are regular.
The Hamiltonian given by (1.5) will be called the Legendre transformation of the
Lagrangian L (also L given by (1.6) will be called the Legendre transformation of
the Hamiltonian H.
Examples:
1. If L is m–homogeneous,
regular Lagrangian, then locally,

then its Legendre transformation is the
Hamiltonian

and
In the following, we will restrict our attention to the diffeomorphisms
(where 
is the Legendre transformation associated to the Hamiltonian given in
(1.6)).
We remark that U and U* are open sets in TM and respectively T*M and
generally are not domains of charts.
The following relations can be checked directly

Using the diffeomorphism 
(or ) we can pull–back or push–forward the geome-
tric structures from U to U* or from U* to U.

and 
are indeed linear
connections on U* and U.
For the torsion and curvature tensors of

(or 
and 
) are dual by the Legendre
transformation or are –dual.
In the next section we will look for geometric objects on U and U* which are
–dual. These geometric objects will be obtained easily each one from the other.

Definition 7.2.1. Let HTU and HTU* be two nonlinear connections on the open
sets U and U*. We say that HTU and HTU* are 
–dual if

7.2.1, (ii), and the above relation we get 
Conversely, from

Example. For a Lagrange manifold the geodesies are extremals of the action inte-
gral of L and coincide with the integral curves of the semispray

This semispray generates a notable nonlinear connection, called canonical, whose
coefficients are given by
(see Section 3.3, Ch. 3).
Using (ii) from Theorem 7.2.1, we get the coefficients 
of its

Remark. As we have seen from the last two sections there exists many geometric
objects (nonlinear connections, linear connections, metrical structures and so on)
which can be transfered by using –duality from U to U* and also from U* to U.
Now let suppose we have a regular Hamiltonian defined on a domain
The Legendre transformation 
is a diffeomorphism between some open
subsets U*, U of D* and TM. Taking the Lagrangian
we can construct a Lagrange geometry restricted to U and then
we pull–back by 
the geometric objects on U, to U*. These will depend only by
Hamiltonian, therefore we will be able to extend them on the whole domain D*.
7.4 
The Finsler–Cartan –duality
In this section we will give an idea for the study of the geometry of a Cartan space
using the –duality and the geometry of its associated Finsler space.
Let H be a 2–homogeneous Hamiltonian on a domain of T*M,
the Legendre transformation and
its associate Lagrangian.
We remark, using the 2–homogeneous property of H, that

and thus 
is 1–homogeneous so, L is 2–homogeneous.
Therefore, using the theory made in the previous sections we may carry some
geometry of Finsler spaces on 2–homogeneous Hamilton manifolds.
Remark. For 2–homogeneous Hamiltonian we have

Then (4.8) becomes
But we can write:
and substituting it in the above equality we get (4.7).
Among Finsler connections, the Cartan connection is without doubt very impor-
tant.
The following result is also well known [88].
Theorem 7.4.2. On a Finsler space there exists only one Finsler connection which
verifies the following axioms (Matsumoto’s axioms)
The coefficients of this Finsler connection are:
and the nonlinear connection is given by (4.6).
The Finsler connection given by (4.9), (4.6), (4.10) is the Cartan connection of
the Finsler space
Using the results of the previous sections we can state the 
–dual of Theorem
7.4.2 for the Cartan space
Theorem 7.4.3. On a Cartan space (M, ) there exists only one N-connection
which satisfies the following axioms:

The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
It is the 
–dual of  the Cartan connection above. That is:

Proof. The connection given by (4.11), (4.12) and (4.7), verifies

connection 
and 
(Proposition 7.3.4).
This connection is unique. Indeed, if there exists another one, taking the  –dual
of it we will get two Finsler connections (restricted to an open set) which satisfy
Matsumoto’s axioms.
The linear connection of Theorem 7.4.3 is just the Cartan connection of the
Cartan space 
We remark that conditions 
 are all the
 –duals
of
Consequently, all properties of  the Cartan connection from Finsler spaces can be
transfered on the Cartan spaces only by using the –duality.
Remark. When we look for a –dual of a d–tensor field we must pay attention to
the vertical indices; in this section (and sometimes in the other sections) for the sake
of simplicity we have omitted to use indices a, b, c, d, e, f  to stand out the vertical
part.

The next results will give us an interesting field where the

applied.
As we know a Randers space is a Finsler space where the metric has the following
form
(Randers metric) and a Kropina space is a Finsler space with the fundamental func-
tion
(Kropina metric) where 
is a Riemannian metric and 
is
a differential 1–form.
We can also consider Cartan spaces having the metric functions of the following
forms
or
and we will again call these spaces Randers and, respectively, Kropina spaces on the
cotangent bundle T*M.

every associated Finsler space is locally Landsberg (Berwald) space.
The following theorems characterize Cartan spaces which are Landsberg and
Berwald spaces.

Proposition 7.5.4. A Cartan space (M, 
) is a locally Minkowski space if and only
if every locally associated Finsler space is locally Minkowski space.
The following result characterizes the Cartan spaces which are locally Minkowski
spaces.

Therefore
(i) and (ii) hold.
If (ii) is true, using the

Minkowski space (see also [130]).
If (i) is true,

     The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Now, using (5.5), we obtain the proof.
Remark. We can get some similar results as in Proposition 7.5.3, Proposition 7.5.4
and Theorem 7.5.6 for a Finsler space, considering Cartan spaces, locally associated
to it. Therefore, some nice results in Finsler space can be obtained as the 
–dual
of those from Cartan spaces.
7.6 
Applications of the -duality
In this section, we shall give some applications of the 
–duality between Finsler
and Cartan spaces.
In terms of the Cartan connection a Landsberg space is a Finsler space such that
the hv–curvature tensor 
[90].
A Cartan space is called Landsberg if 
Using the –duality it is clear
that a Finsler space is a Landsberg space iff its –dual is a Landsberg one.
In [151] (see also [90], [77]) was proved that a Randers space is a Landsberg
space iff 
(here “;" stands for covariant derivative with respect to Levi-Cività
connection of the Riemannian manifold (M, 
)).
For Kropina spaces we have a “dual” of the above result:
Theorem 7.6.1. A Kropina space is a Landsberg space if and only if
Proof. The Randers metric
is a Landsberg metric  iff
(here 
stands for covariant derivative with respect to the Levi-Cività connection
of  the Riemannian manifold (M, 
).
Hence, we have the following equivalent statements:
The Kropina space is Landsberg 
its –dual is Landsberg

So we get
which also was obtained in [90], [77] by a different argument.
We can obtain other properties of Kropina spaces from those of Randers by using
the 
–duality.
Theorem 7.6.2 i) Kropina space is a Berwald space if and only if
ii) Kropina space is locally Minkowski space if and only if the condition (6.2) above
holds and also
where

connection of
Proof of the Theorem 7.6.2. We take the  –dual of the Kropina metric (4.14)
and we get the Hamiltonian (4.18). We have
Therefore, Riemannian manifolds (M, 
) and (M, 
) are conformal and the coef-
ficients of Levi-Cività connections are related as follows:
The condition (6.4) is written as (6.2).
Also, for the conformal metrics, we have
For our position 
and using the above equality,
we get (6.3). Finally, we apply the results of the previous section.
Remark. (i) The results of Theorem 7.6.2 were obtained by Kikuchi [77] in a
different form and also by Matsumoto [90] in this form, by using of totally different
ideas.
(ii) A Finsler space with a Kropina metric is Berwald space if and only if (6.2) is
true. Indeed, it is easily checked that the Cartan space with Randers metric (4.15)
is a Berwald space if and only if 
(see [151] for Finsler spaces with Randers
metric). Therefore, we follow the same idea as in Theorem 7.6.2.
Let us now give another example of using of –duality (see also [63]). If (M, F)
is Finsler space with
(m–th root metric [11], [152]), its 
–dual is Cartan space having fundamental
function

The geodesies of (M, F), parametrized by the arclength, are just the ecological
equations (see [11], [12], [18], [152]). The –duals of these equations have a simpler
form:

(Hamilton-Jacobi equations), where 
The solutions of (6.5) are h–paths
of (M, 
)  [66].

Chapter 8
Symplectic transformations of the
differential geometry of T*M
It is well-known that symplectic transformations preserve the form of the Hamilton-
Jacobi equations. However, the natural metric tensor (kinetic energy matrix) is not
generally invariant nor is its associated differential geometry. In this chapter we ad-
dress precisely the question of how the geometry of the cotangent bundle changes un-
der symplectic transformation. As a special case, we also consider the homogeneous
contact transformations. The geometry of spaces admitting contact transformations
was initiated and developed by Eisenhart [53], Eisenhart and Knebelman [55], where
the first contact frame was introduced. Muto [122] and Doyle [52] introduced inde-
pendently, the second contact frame and the geometry of the homogeneous contact
manifolds was intensively studied by Yano and Muto [173, 174]. The chapter is
based on [14].
8.1 Connection-pairs on cotangent bundle
Let M be a n–dimensional
 –differentiable manifold and
the
cotangent bundle. As we have seen (Chapter 4) a nonlinear connection on T*M is
a supplementary distribution HT*M of the vertical distribution
( 
is the tangent map of

connection as an almost product structure 
on T*M such that

geometrical structure which nevertheless is an extension of the above definition for
connections.

The dual bundle of a k-osculator
bundle
The cotangent bundle T*M , dual of the tangent bundle carries some canonical
geometric object field as: the Liouville vector field, a symplectic structure and a
Poisson structure. They allow to construct a theory of Hamiltonian systems, and,
via Legendre transformation, to transport this theory in that of Lagrangian systems
on the tangent bundle. Therefore, the Lagrange spaces 
appear as
dual of Hamilton spaces 
(cf. Ch.7).
In the theory of Lagrange spaces of order k, where the fundamental functions are
Lagrangians which depend on point and higher order accelerations, we do not have
a dual theory based on a good notion of higher order Hamiltonian, which depend on
point, higher order accelerations and momentum (of order 1, only). This is because
we have not find yet a differentiable bundle which have a canonical symplectic or
presymplectic structure and a canonical Poisson structure and which is basic for a
good theory of the higher order Hamiltonian systems.
The purpose of this chapter is to elliminate this incovenient. Starting from the
k-osculator bundle 
identified with k-tangent bundle
we introduce a new differentiable bundle 
called dual bundle of k-
osculator bundle (or k-tangent bundle), where the total space 
is the fibered
product:
We prove that on the manifold 
there exist a canonical Liouville 1–form, a
canonical presymplectic structure and a canonical Poisson structure. Consequently
we can develop a natural theory of Hamiltonian systems of order k, for the Hamilton
functions which depend on point, accelerations of order 1,2,..., k – 1 and momenta.
These properties are fundamental for introducing the notion of Hamilton space
of order k.
We will develop in the next chapters the geometry of second order Hamilton
219

220 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
spaces and we remark that this is a natural extension of the geometry of Hamilton
spaces, studied in the previous chapters.
All this theory is based on the paper [110] of the first author.

q.e.d.
Now, let us consider the system of Poisson brackets:
defined by
We obtain:
Theorem 9.1.4. Every bracket 
defines a canonical
Poisson structure on the manifold
Proof. We prove that the Poisson bracket 
 is invariant
under the transformations of coordinates (1.5) on 
 Indeed, by means of (1.6)

226 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
we have
But the first formulae, by means of (1.5)', can be written as follows:
And also, taking into account the identities:
we obtain:
Consequently
It is clear that:
is R-linear in every argument
holds.
Finally, we prove that the Jacobi identities hold, i.e.:

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
227
Finally, by a direct calculus, it is not difficult to prove the Jacobi identities (1.8)"
for every Poisson bracket 
q.e.d.
For more clarity, all these considerations will be applied in the case 
in
order to study the geometry of  Hamilton spaces of order 2.
9.2 
The dual of the 2–osculator bundle
The theory from the previous section can be particularized to the case
We obtain in this way the dual of the 2-tangent bundle 
given by
where 
can be identified with
Notice that the last one is exactly the Whitney sum of vector bundles
We have
where 
is the tangent bundle of the manifold M and 
its
cotangent bundle. A point 
can be written in the form
having the local coordinates 
The projections
are defined by 
and
is given by 
Let us denote 
We get
the following commuttive diagram:
A change of local coordinates is given by

228 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
The dimension of the manifold 
is 3n.
For every point 
the natural basis
of the tangent space 
transformes, with respect to (2.1), as follows:
The Jacobian matrix of the change of coordinates (2.1) is given by
Theorem 9.2.1.
The differentiable manifold 
is orientable if and only if the
base manifold M is  orientable.
The nul section 
of the projection 
is defined by
we denote by
Let us consider the tangent bundle of the differentiable manifold 
It is given
by the triade 
where 
is the canonical projection. Taking
into account the kernel of the differential 
of the mapping 
 we get the vertical
subbundle
This leads to the vertical distribution
The local dimension of the vertical distribution V is 2n and V is locally
generated by the vector fields 
As usually, let us
denote

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
229
It follows that the vertical distribution V is integrable. By means of the relation
(2.3), we can consider the following subdistributions of V:
locally generated by the vector fields 
It is an integrable distri-
bution of local dimension n
Let us consider also the subdistribution
locally generated by the vector fields 
Of course, 
is also an
integrable distribution of local dimension n
Clearly, we have
Proposition 9.2.1. The vertical distribution V has the property
Now, some important geometrical object fields can be introduced:
(i) the Liouville vector field on
(ii) the Hamilton vector field on
(iii) the scalar field
We remark that 
and
Also, let us consider the following forms
Then, Theorem 9.1.3 leads to the following result:
Theorem 9.2.2.
1° The differential  forms 
 and 
are globally defined on the  manifold

230 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
2° The 2-form 
 is closed and rank 
is 2n.
3° 
is a presymplectic structure on
The Poisson brackets 
can be defined on the manifold 
by:
Therefore, Theorem 9.1.4 can be particularized in:
Theorem 9.2.3. Every bracket 
and 
defines a canonical Poisson struc-
ture on the  manifold
Now, it is not difficult to prove that the following         
–linear mapping
defined by
has geometrical meaning.
It is not difficult to prove:
Theorem 9.2.4. The following properties hold:
1°. J is a tensor field of type (1,1) on the manifold
2°. J is a tangent structure on 
i.e.
3°. J is an integrable structure.
4°.
We are going to use these object fields to construct the geometry of the manifold

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle

9.3 Dual semisprays on
An important notion suggested by the geometrical theory of the Lagrange spaces of
order 2 is that of dual semisprays.
Definition 9.3.1. A dual semispray on 
is a vector field S on 
with the
property:
Taking into account (2.6) and (2.11) it follows:
Proposition 9.3.1. A dual semispray S on 
can be represented locally by
The system of functions 
is called the coefficients of the dual
semispray S. However, they are not any arbitrary functions. In fact, 
 and
are important geometrical object fields.
Theorem 9.3.1. With respect to the transformation law (2.2) on 
 the func-
tions 
and 
transform as follows:
Conversely, if on every domain of local chart on 
are given the systems of
functions 
 and 
such that, with respect to (2.2), the formula
(3.3) and (3.3)' hold, then S given by (3.2) is a dual semispray on
The proof is not difficult. It is similar with the proof given by semisprays on the
osculator bundle
Two immediate properties are the following:
Proposition 9.3.2. The integral curves of the dual semispray S, from (3.2), are
given by the solution curves of the system of differential equations:

232 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Proposition 9.3.3. Every dual semispray S on the  manifold 
 with the coef-
ficients 
determines a bundle morphism
defined  by
Moreover, it is a local diffeomorphism if and only if rank
We shall see in Chapter 10 that the bundle morphism 
defined in (3.5)', is
uniquely determined by the Legendre transformation between a Lagrange space of
order two, 
and a Hamilton space of order two,
(M,H(x, y, p)).
Consequently, if the bundle morphism 
 defined in (3.5)' is apriori given, the
dual spray S, denoted by
is characterized only by the coefficients
We have, also:
Proposition 9.3.4. The formula:
holds.
An important problem is the existence of the dual semisprays on
Theorem 9.3.2. If the base manifold M is paracompact, then on 
there exist
dual semisprays 
with apriori given bundle morphism
Proof. Assuming that the manifold M is paracompact by means of Theorem 9.1.2,
it follows that the manifold 
is paracompact, too. We shall see (Ch.10) that a
bundle morphism 
defined in (3.5)' exists. Now, let 
be a Riemannian
metric on M and 
its Christoffel symbols.
Setting
we can prove that the rule of transformations of the systems of functions 
with
respect to the transformation of local coordinates (2.2) are given by (3.3)'.

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
233
Indeed, we have
The contractions with 
and 
lead to
which is exactly (3.3)'.
Therefore 
from (3.7) are the coefficients of a dual semispray.
As a consequence, we have:
Theorem 9.3.3. The following systems of functions
are geometrical object fields on 
having the following rules  of transformations,
with respect to the changing of local coordinates (2.2):
These properties can be proved by a direct computation starting from the for-
mulae (3.3)'.
Remarks.
1°. We will see that the system of functions 
gives us the coefficients of
a nonlinear connection on
2°. With respect to (2.2), the system of functions
is transformed like a skew symmetric, covariant d-tensor field.

9.4 Homogeneity
The notion of homogeneity for the functions f (x, y, p), defined on the manifold
can be defined with respect to 
as well as, with respect to 
 respectively. Indeed,
any homothety
is preserved by the transformation of local coordinates (2.2).
Let 
be the group of transformation on
The orbit of a point 
by 
is given by
The tangent vector in the point 
is the Liouville vector field
Definition 9.4.1. A function 
 differentiable  on
and continuous on the null section of the projection 
 is called
homogeneous of degree 
 with respect to 
if
It follows[106]:
Theorem 9.4.1. A function 
differentiable on 
and continuous
of the null section is r-homogeneous with respect to 
if and only if
where 
is the Lie derivation with respect to the Liouville vector field
We notice that (4.1) can be written in the form:
The entire theory of homogeneity, with respect to 
exposed in the book [106], can
be applied.
However, in our case it is important to define the notion of homogeneity with
respect to variables
Let 
be the group of homotheties

Ch. 9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
235
The orbit of a point 
by 
is given by
Its tangent vector in the point 
is the Hamilton vector field
A function 
differentiable on 
and continuous on the null
section is called homogeneous of degree r, 
with respect to the variables 
if
In other words:
It follows
Theorem 9.4.2. A function
differentiable on 
  and continuous
on the null section is r–homogeneous with respect to 
if and only if we have
Of course, (4.2)' is given by
A vector field 
is r–homogeneous with respect to 
if
We have:
Theorem 9.4.3. A vector field 
is r–homogeneous with respect to
if and only if
Corollary 9.4.1. The vector fields 
  are 1, 1, 0–homogeneous with re-
spect to 
respectively.

236 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces

if and only if
is r – l homogeneous,
is r – l homogeneous,
is r homogeneous.
It results:
Proposition 9.4.1.  If
arer– and s–homogeneous
with respect to 
respectively, then f X is r + s–homogeneous.
In particular:
1°. The Hamilton vector field 
is 1–homogeneous.
2°. A dual semispray
is 1–homogeneous with respect to 
if and only if  its  coefficients 
 are 0–ho-
mogeneous  and 
are 1–homogeneous with respect to
Proposition 9.4.2.    If
is r–homogeneous and f is s–homogeneous
with respect to 
then X f is r + s – l – homogeneous with respect to
Corollary 9.4.3.  If r       
is r–homogeneous with respect to 
and  differ-
entiable on 
then
1°. 
are (r – 1)–homogeneous.
2°. 
is (r – 2) –homogeneous.
A q–form
is called s–homogeneous with respect to 
if
Corollary 9.4.4. If  the functions f,
are r – and s – homogeneous with
respect to 
respectively, then the functions given by the Poisson brackets
and 
are (r + s – 1) –homogeneous, respectively.

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
237
The following result holds:
Theorem 9.4.4. A q–form 
is s–homogeneous with respect to 
if
and only if
It follows:
Proposition 9.4.3. The  1–forms 
are 0, 0, 1 homogeneous
with respect to 
respectively.
In the next section we will apply these considerations for study the notion of the
Hamilton spaces of order 2.
Finally, we remark:
Proposition 9.4.4. A dual semispray 
is 2–homogeneous with respect to 
if and
only if the  coefficients 
 are 2–homogeneous and 
 are 1–homogeneous with respect
to
A dual semispray 
which is 2–homogeneous with respect to 
 is called a dual
spray.
9.5 Nonlinear connections
We extend the classical definition [97] of the nonlinear connection on the total space
of the dual bundle
Definition 9.5.1. A nonlinear connection on the manifold 
is a regular dis-
tribution N on 
supplementary to the vertical distribution V, i.e.
Taking into account Proposition 9.2.7 it follows that the distribution  N has the
property:
Therefore, the main geometrical objects on 
 will be reported to the direct sum
(5.2) of vector spaces.
We denote by

238 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
a local adapted basis to 
Clearly, we have
The systems of functions 
are the coefficients of the nonlin-
ear connection N.
With respect to the coordinate transformations (2.2), 
are trans-
formed by the rule:
It is not difficult to prove the following property
Theorem 9.5.1. The coefficients 
of a nonlinear connection N on
obey the rule of transformations (3.10) with respect to a changing of local coordinates
(2.2). 
Conversely, if the systems of functions 
are given on the every
domain of local chart of the manifold 
such that the first two equations (3.10)
hold, then 
are the coefficients of a nonlinear connection on
It is convenient then to use the basis (5.3), if the coefficients 
and 
are
determined only by the coefficients 
of the semispray
It is not difficult to prove the following theorem:
Theorem 9.5.2.  If 
   is a dual semispray with the  coefficients 
  then the systems
of functions
are the coefficients of a nonlinear connection.
Conversely:
Theorem 9.5.3.   If    
are coefficients of a nonlinear connection N, then
the following systems of  functions
are the coefficients of a dual  semispray 
where 
are apriori given.
Taking into account Theorems 9.3.2 and 9.5.2, we can affirm:

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
239
Theorem 9.5.4. If  the base manifold M is paracompact, then there exist nonlinear
connections on the manifold
From now on we denote the basis (5.3) by:
The dual basis of the adapted basis (5.3) is given by
where
With respect to (2.2), the covector fields (5.6) are transformed by the rules:
Also, we remark that the differential of a function 
can be written in
the form
9.6 
Distinguished vector and covector fields
Let N be a nonlinear connection. Then, it gives rise to the direct decomposition
(5.2). Let h, 
be the projectors defined by the distributions N , 
They
have the following properties:
If 
we denote:
Therefore we have the unique decomposition:
Each of the components 
is called a d–vector field on

240 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
In the adapted basis (5.3) we get
By means of (5.4) we have
But, these are the classical rules of the transformations of the local coordinates of
vector and covector fields on the base manifold M [97]. Therefore 
 are
called d–vector fields and 
is called a d–covector field.
For instance, the Liouville vector field 
and Hamilton vector field 
have the
properties:
A dual semispray 
from (4.4), in the adapted basis (5.2), has the decomposition
where:
being a d–vector field and 
a d–covector field.
Assuming that the nonlinear connection N provides from a dual semispray
with the coefficients 
we get
It follows that the vector 
and covector 
 are given by
A similar theory can be done for distinguished 1-forms.
With respect to the direct decomposition (5.2) a 1-form 
can be
uniquely written in the form:
where

Ch.9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
241
In the adapted cobasis (5.6) and (5.6)', we have
The quantities 
are called d-1-forms.
The coefficients 
and 
are transformed by (2.2) as follows:
Hence 
and 
are called d-covector fields and 
will be called d-vector field.
If the nonlinear connection N is apriori given, then some remarkable d-1-forms
can be associated in a natural way. Namely, let us consider:
We will use these d-forms for studying the Hamilton geometry of order 2 on
Proposition 9.6.1. The following properties hold:
If 
 is a dual semispray, as in (6.5), and nonlinear connection N is determined
by 
as in (6.6)', then we have
Now, let us consider a function f on 
Its differential can be written in the
form (5.7). Therefore
Let us consider a smooth parametrized curve 
such that
It can be analytical represented by:

242 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
The tangent vector 
in a point of the curve 
 can be written in the form:
where
The curve in (6. 3) is called horizontal if 
in every point of the curve
Proposition 9. 6. 2. An horizontal curve on 
is characterized by the following
system  of differential equations:
Clearly, the system of differential equations (6. 15) has local solutions, if the
initial points 
 on 
are given,
9. 7 Lie brackets. Exterior differentials
In applications, the Lie brackets of the vector fields 
 from the adapted
basis to the direct decomposition (5. 2), are important.
Proposition 9. 7. 1.
The Lie brackets of the vector fields of the adapted basis are
given by

Ch. 9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
243
where
The proof of this relations can be done by a direct calculus.
Now we can establish:
Proposition 9. 7. 2. The exterior differentials of the  1-forms
which
determine the adapted cobasis (5. 6)', are given by
Indeed, from (5. 6)' we deduce
Using (6. 11) for 
and 
we have the formula (7. 3).
Now, the exterior differentials of the 
 from (6. 9), can be easily determined.
Let us consider the following coefficients from (7. 1):
By means of (3. 10) it follows:
Proposition 9. 7. 3. The  coefficients 
  have the same rule of transfor-
mation with respect to the local changing of coordinates on 
This is

244 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
We will see that these coefficients are the horizontal coefficients of an N–linear
connection.
We obtain also:
Proposition 9. 7. 4. The  coefficients:
are d-tensor fields.
9. 8 The almost product structure 
The almost
contact structure
Assuming that a nonlinear connection N is given, we define a
–linear map-
ping
by defined
We have also,
Theorem 9. 8. 1. A nonlinear connection N on 
is characterized by the exis-
tence of an almost product structure 
on 
whose eigenspaces corresponding
to the eigenvalue –l coincide with the linear spaces of the vertical distribution V on
E.
Proof. If N is given, then we have the direct sum (5. 1). Denoting by h and v
the supplementary projectors determined by (5. 1) we have 
with the
properties 
  So, the imposed condition is verified.
Conversely, if 
and 
then let 
and
We verify easy that 
So N = Kerv. It follows 
q. e. d.

Ch. 9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle

Proposition 9. 8. 1. The almost product structure 
is integrable if, and only if,
the horizontal distribution N is integrable.
Proof. The Nijenhuis tensor of the structure
gives us for
Therefore 
if and only if 
But
allows to say that the horizontal distribution N is integrable.
The nonlinear connection N being fixed we have the direct decomposition (5. 1),
(5. 2) and the corresponding adapted basis (5. 4).
Let us consider the
–linear mapping:
determined by
Then, we deduce:
Theorem 9. 8. 2. The mapping 
has the following properties:
1°. It  is  globally  defined  on
2°. 
is  a  tensor  field of type (1, 1).
3°.

and 
So
and
We can say that 
is a natural almost contact structure determined by the
nonlinear connection N.
The Nijenhuis tensor of the structure 
 is given by:
and the normality condition of 
reads as follows:
Of course, in the adapted basis, using the formula (7. 3) we can obtainthe explicit
form of the equation (8. 5).
9. 9 The Riemannian structures on
Let us consider a Riemannian structure 
on the manifold
The following problem is arises:  Can the Riemannian structure 
 determine a
nonlinear connection N on 
Also, can 
 determine a dual semispray 
on
In order to determine a nonlinear connection on 
by means of      it is
sufficient to determine a distribution N orthogonal to the vertical distribution V.
The solution is immediate. Namely, it is important to determine the coefficients
and 
of N.

Ch. 9. The dual bundle of the k-osculator bundle 
247
In the natural basis, 
is given locally by
where the matrix 
is positively defined.
Let 
(i = 1, ..., n), be the adapted basis of N:
The following conditions of orthogonality between N and V:
give us the following system of equations for determining the  coefficients 
and
where, the matrix
is nonsingular.
Therefore the system (9. 4) has an unique solution.
Whether, take into account the rule of transformation of the coefficients
 from      we can prove that the solution 
of (9. 4) has the rule of trans-
formation (3. 10), by means of the transformations of local coordinates on
Consequently, we have:
Theorem 9. 9. 1. A Riemannian structure 
on 
determines uniquely a non-
linear connection N, if the distribution of  N is orthogonal to the vertical distribution
V. The coefficients 
of  N are given by the system of equations (9. 4).
Remarking that 
are the coefficients of a dual spray 
we have:

248 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 9. 9. 2. A Riemannian structure  
on 
determines a dual semispray
with the  coefficients
being determined by the system (9. 4).
Let 
be the natural almost contact structure determined by the previous non-
linear connection N.
The following problem arises: When will the pair 
is a Riemannian almost
contact structure?
Of course, it is necessary to have:
Consequently, we get:
Theorem 9. 9. 3. The pair 
is a Riemannian almost contact structure if and
only if in the adapted basis determined by N and V the tensor 
has the form
Corollary 9. 9. 1. With respect to the Riemannian structure (9. 5) the distributions
are orthogonal respectively.
Remarks.
1° The form (9. 5) will be used to define a lift to 
 of a metric structure given
only by a nonsingular and symmetric d–tensor field
Namely, we have
These problemes will be studied in a next chapter.
2° Using the metric 
on 
we can introduce a new almost contact structure
defined by
We will prove that 
is a Riemannian almost contact structure and its
associated 2-form 
is given by
The pair 
will be studied in the Chapter 11 about the generalized Hamilton
spaces of order 2.

Chapter 10
Linear connections on the
manifold
The main topics of this chapter is to show that there are the linear connection
compatible to the direct decomposition (5.2) determined by a nonlinear connection
N, on the total space of the dual bundle
We are going to study the distinguished Tensor Algebra (or d–Tensor Alge-
bra), N-linear connections, torsions and curvatures, structure equations, autoparal-
lel curves, etc.
10.1 
The d–Tensor Algebra
Let N be a nonlinear connection on 
Then N determines the direct decom-
position (5.2), Ch.9. With respect to (5.2), Ch.9, a vector field X and an one form
can be uniquely written in the form (6.3) and (6.7), Ch.9, respectively, i.e.
Definition 10.1.1. A distinguished tensor field (briefly: d-tensor field) on
of type (r, s) is a tensor field T of type (r, s) on 
with the property:
for any 
and for any
For instance, every component 
and
of a vector field
is a d-vector field.
249

250 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Also, every component 
and 
of the 1-form 
is a
d-l-form.
In the adapted basis 
and cobasis 
to the direct decompo-
sition (5.2), a d-tensor field T of type (r, s) can be written in the form:
It follows that the set 
generates the algebra of the d-tensor fields over
the ring of functions
For example, if 
then 
are d-1-covectors and
is a d-vector field.
Clearly, with respect to a local transformation a coordinates on 
the coef-
ficients 
of a d-tensor fields are transformed by the classical rule:
10.2
N-linear connections
The notion of N-linear connection will be defined in the known manner [97]:
Definition 10.2.1. A linear connection D on 
is called an N-linear connection,
if:
(1) D preserves by parallelism distributions N,       and
(2) The 2-tangent structure J is absolute parallel with respect to D.
(3) The presymplectic structure 
is absolute parallel with respect to D.
Starting from this definition, any N-linear connection is characterized by the
following:
Theorem 10.2.1. A linear connection D is an N –linear connection on          if
and only if:
(1) D preserves by parallelism every of distributions N,
(2)
(3)

Ch.10. Linear connections on the manifold 
251
The proof is similar with the case given in the book [106].
We remark that 
is trivial, because
and that by means of the property (1), it follows
We obtain also:
Theorem 10.2.2. For any N–linear connectionD we have
Indeed, from 
if 
and
we obtain 
Similarly, we get
Now, taking into account the expression (8.2), Ch.IX, of    it follows
The last equality 
can be proved in a similar way.
Let us consider a vector field 
written in the form (1.1). It follows,
from the property of an N–linear connection that
We can introduce new operators of derivation in the d-tensor algebra, defined by:
These operators are not the covariant derivations in the d-tensor algebra, since
(etc.). However they have similar properties with the covariant
derivatives.
From (2.3) and (2.4) we deduce
By means of Theorem 10.2.2, the action of the operator 
on the d-vector fields
is the same as its action on the d-vectors 
This property holds for the
operators 
and 
too.
Theorem 10.2.3. The operators 
have the following properties:
1) Every 
maps a vector field belonging to one of distributions
N, 
in a vector field belonging to the same distribution.
2)
3)
4)

252

6)
7)
8) 
being the presymplectic structure from
Theorem 6.7.1.
9) The operators 
have the property of localization on the manifold
i. e. 
etc. for any open set
The proof of the previous theorem can be done by the classical methods [106].
The operators 
will be called the operators of h–, 
and
covariant derivation.
The actions of these operators over the 1-form fields 
on 
are given by
Of course, the action of the previous operators can be extended to any tensor
field, particularly to any d-tensor field on
Now, let us consider a parametrized smooth curve
having the image in a domain of a local chart.
Its tangent vector field 
can be uniquely written in the form
In the case when is analytically given by the equation (6.12), Ch.9, then
are given by (6.13), Ch.9. And we can define the horizontal curve.
A vector field Y defined along the curve 
has the covariant derivative
The vector field 
is called parallel along the curve 
if
In particular, the curve 
is autoparallel with respect to an N–linear connection

10.3 Torsion and curvature
The torsion 
of an N-linear connection D is expressed, as usually, by
It can be characterized by the vector fields
Taking the h– and 
–components we obtain the torsion d-tensors
Since D preserves by parallelism the distributions H, 
and the distribu-
tions 
are integrable it follows
Proposition 10.3.1. The following property of the torsion 
holds:
Now we can express, without difficulties, the torsion d-tensors by means of the
formula (3.1).
The curvature of D is given by
We will express   by means of the components (2.5), taking into account the de-
composition (1.1) for the vector fields on
Proposition 10.3.2. For any vector fields
the following pro-
perties holds:
The previous properties have an important consequence:

1° The essential components of the curvature tensor field  are
and
2° The vector field 
is horizontal.
3° The vector field 
belongs to the distribution
4° The following properties hold
Of course, we can express the d-tensors of curvature by means of the operators
of h–, 
covariant derivatives (2.5)".
From (3.4) we get the following Ricci identities
As a consequence, we obtain:
Theorem 10.3.1. For any N –linear connection D there are the following identities
where 
is the Liouville vector field, and 
is the Hamilton vector field on the
manifold
Using the previous considerations we can express the Bianchi identities of the N–
linear connection D, by means of the operators 
taking into account
the classical Bianchi identities

10.4 
The coefficients of an N-linear connection
An N–linear connection is characterized by its coefficientsin the adapted basis
These coefficients obey particular rules of transformation with respect to the chang-
ing of local coordinates on the manifold
Taking into account Proposition 10.3.2, we can prove the following theorem:
Theorem 10.4.1.
1° An N-linear connection D can be uniquely represented, in the adapted basis
in the following form:
2° With respect to the coordinate transformation (1.1), Ch.6, the coefficients
obey the rule of transformation:
3° The coefficients 
and 
are d-tensor fields of type (1,2)
and (2,1), respectively.
Indeed, putting
and taking into account Theorem 10.2.3, it follows
The statements 2° and 3° can be proved by a direct calculus, taking into account
the rule of transformations (5.4)’, Ch.9, for 
and
The system of functions

256 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
are called the coefficients of the N–linear connection D.
The inverse statement of the previous theorem holds also.
Theorem 10.4.2. If the systems of functions (4.3) are apriori given over every
domain of local chart on the manifold 
having the rule of transformation
mentioned in the previous theorem, then there exists a unique N –linear connection
D whose coefficients are just the systems of given functions.
Corollary 10.4.1. The following formula hold:
Indeed, the formula (4.1), the condition of duality between 
and
leads to the formula (4.4).
10.5 
The h–, 
covariant derivatives in lo-
cal adapted basis
Let us consider a d–tensor field T, of type (r, s) in the adapted basis 
and
its dual (see (1.3)):
For 
applying (4.1), (4.4) and using the properties of the operator
we deduce:
where
The operator 
is called h–covariant derivative with respect to
Now, putting 
we obtain for the d-tensor field T from (5.1),
the formula:

The operator 
will be called ”the 
–covariant derivative” with respect to
Finally, taking 
then 
has the following form

The operator 
will be called the
–covariant derivative.
It is not difficult to prove:

are d–tensor fields. 
The first two are of type 
and the last one is of type
Proposition 10.5.2. The operators 
and 
have the properties:
1°.
2°.  They are distributive with respect to the addition of the d–tensor of the same
type.
3°. They commute with the operation of contraction.
4°. They verify the Leibniz rule with respect to the tensor product.
As an application let us consider ”the (y)–deflection tensor fields”
Proposition 10.5.3. The (y)-deflection tensor field have the expression

258 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
These equalities are easy to prove, if one notice
Now, we consider the so called ”(p)-deflection tensor fields”:
Proposition 10.5.4. The (p)-deflection tensors are given by
A particular class of the N–connection with the coefficients 
is given by
the Berwald connectioin.
Definition 10.5.1. An N–linear connection D with the coefficients (4.3) is called
a Berwald connection if its coefficients are:
This definition has a geometrical meaning if we take into account Proposition
9.7.4.
The existence of the Berwald connection is an interesting example of N–linear
connection.
Remarking that the Berwald connection is uniquely determined by the nonlinear
connection N and the fact that the nonlinear connection exists over a paracompact
manifold 
(cf. Theorem 9.3.2), we can state:
Theorem 10.5.1. If the base manifold M is paracompact, then on the manifold
there exists the N –linear connections.
Of course, the (y)–deflections and (p)–deflection tensor fields of the Berwald
connection
are very particular.
We get
Hence, 
if and only if the coefficients 
are 1-homogeneous with respect
to

Ricci identities. The local expressions of
curvature and torsion.
In order to determine the local expressions of d–tensors of torsion and curvature of
an N–linear connection we establish the Ricci identities applied to a d–vector field,
using the covariant derivatives (4.5)', (4.6)' and (4.7)'.
Theorem 10.6.1. For any N –linear connection D the following Ricci identities
hold:
and
where the following tensors
and
and
are torsion d-tensors.

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
The d-tensors of curvature are given by
and
Proof. By a direct calculus we have
Interchanging j and k and subtracting, we get
And since the Lie brackets 
are given by (7.1), Ch.9., the previous equalities
give us the first identity (6.1), the coefficients being given by (6.3), (6.3)' and (6.4).
The identities (6.1) and (6.2) can be proved in the same manner. 
q.e.d.
Remark. Cf. Proposition 9.7.4, the d-torsions 
are d-tensors.
As usually, we extend the Ricci identities for any d-tensor field, given by (1.3).

Ch.10. Linear connections on the manifold 
261
As a first application let us consider a Riemann d-metric
which is covariant
constant, i.e.:
Then we have:
Theorem 10.6.2. If the Riemann d-metric 
verifies the condition (6.5), then the
following d-tensors
are skew-symmetries in the first two indices (ij).
Indeed, writing the Ricci identities for d-tensor 
and taking into account by
the equations (6.5) we deduce
And using (6.5)', we get 
etc.
The Ricci identities (6.1), (6.2) applied to the Liouville d-vector field 
and to
the Hamilton d-covector field 
lead to the same fundamental identities.
Theorem 10.6.3. Any canonical N –linear connection D satisfies the following
identities:
and

and
In the case of Berwald connection 
the previous theory is a very simple
one.
Also, if the (y)–deflection tensors and (p)–deflection tensors have the following
particular form
then, the fundamental identities from (6.6), (6.6)' and (6.7), (6.7)' are very impor-
tant, especially for applications.
Proposition 10.6.1. If the deflection tensors are given by (6.8), then the following
identities hold:

in
the adapted basis
Let us consider a smooth parametrized curve 
having the image

The tangent vector field 
by means of (6.13) and 
Ch.9, can be written
as follows:
where
Let us denote
The quantity DX is the covariant differential of the vector X and 
is the
covariant differential along the curve
If X is written in the form
and we put
then, after a straighforward calculus, we have

Here, 
are called 1–forms of connection of D.
Putting
the covariant differential along the curve 
is given by
The theory of the parallelism of the vector fields along a curve 
presented in Sect.2
of this chapter can be applied here. We obtain:
Theorem 10.7.1. 
The vector field 
is parallel along the
parametrized curve 
with respect to D, if, and only if, its coordinates
are solutions of the differential equations
The proof is immediate, by means of the expression (7.7) for
A theorem of existence and uniqueness for the parallel vector fields along a given
parametrized curve in 
can be formulated in a classical manner.
The vector field 
is called absolute parallel with respect to the
canonical N–linear connection 
if 
for any curve 
It is equivalent
to the fact that the following system of Pfaff equations
is integrable.

Ch.10. Linear connections on the manifold
265
The system (7.9) is equivalent to the system
which must be integrable.
Using the Ricci identities, the previous system is integrable if and only if the
coordinates 
of the vector X satisfy the following equations
and
The manifold 
is called with absolute parallelism of vectors with respect to D,
if any vector field on 
is absolute parallel.
In this case the systems (7.10), (7.11) are verified for any vector field X. It
follows:
Theorem 10.7.2. The manifold 
is with absolute parallelism of vectors, with
respect to the N–linear connection D if, and only if, all d–curvature tensors of D
vanish.
The curve 
is autoparallel with respect to D if
By means of (7.2) and (7.7) we deduce
Theorem 10.7.3. A smooth parametrized curve (7.1) is an autoparallel curve with
respect to the N –linear connection D if and only if the functions

266 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
verify the following system of differential equations
Of course, the theorem of existence and uniqueness for the autoparallel curve
can be easily formulated.
We recall that 
is an horizontal curve if 
The horizontal curves are
characterized by
Definition 10.7.1. An horizontal path of an N –linear connection D is a horizontal
autoparallel curve with respect to D.
Theorem 10.7.4. The horizontal paths of an N –linear connection D are characte-
rized by the system of differential equations:
Indeed, the equations (7.14), (7.6)' and (7.13) imply (7.15).
A parametrized curve 
is 
–vertical in the point 
if its
tangent vector field 
belongs to the distribution
Evidently, a 
–vertical curve 
in the point 
is represented by the
equations of the form
and a 
–vertical curve 
in the point 
is analytically represented by the
equations of the form
We define a 
–path 
in the point 
with respect to D to be
a 
–vertical curve 
in the mentioned point, which is an autoparallel curve with
respect to D.
By means of (7.16), (7.16)' and (7.12) we can prove:

Ch.10. Linear connections on the manifold 
267
Theorem 10.7.5.
1°. The 
–vertical paths in the point 
are characterized by the system of
differential equations
2°. The 
-vertical paths in the point 
are characterized by the system of
differential equations
Remark. We assume that there exists the coefficients
In the case of the Berwald connection 
(5.8), the previous characteriza-
tions of 
-paths appear in a very simple form.
10.8 
Structure equations of an N–linear connec-
tion
For an N –linear connection D, with the coefficients 
in the
adapted basis 
we can prove:
Lemma 10.8.1.
1°. Each of the following geometrical object fields
are d-vector fields. However, the last one is a d-covector field, with respect to
the index i.
2°. The geometrical object field
is a d-tensor field, with respect to indices i and j.
Using the previous Lemma we can prove, by a straightforward calculus, a fun-
damental result in the geometry of the Hamilton spaces of order 2.

Remark. The previous theorem is extremely important in a theory of submani-
folds embedding in the total space 
of the dual bundle
endowed with a regular Hamiltonian of order 2.

Chapter 11
Generalized Hamilton spaces
of order 2
One of the most important structures on the total space of the dual bundle
is the notion of generalized Hamilton metric of order two,
[110]. It is
suggested by the generalized Hamilton metric, described in the section 1 of Ch.
5, which has notable applications in Relativistic Optics of order two. We define
the concept of generalized Hamilton space as the pair
and study a criteria of reducibility, the most general metrical connections, lift of a
GH–metric, the almost contact geometrical model. We end this section with some
example of remarkable 
–spaces.
11.1 The spaces
Definition 11.1.1. A generalized Hamilton space of order two is a pair
where
1°
is a d–tensor field of type (2, 0), symmetric and nondegenerate on the ma-
nifold
2° The quadratic form 
has a constant signature on
As usually 
is called the fundamental tensor or metric tensor of the space
In the case when 
is a paracompact manifold then on 
there exist
the metric tensors 
positively defined such that 
is a generalized
Hamilton space.
Definition 11.1.2. A generalized Hamilton metric 
of order two (on short
GH–metric) is called reducible to an Hamilton metric (H–metric) of order two if
271
GH(2)n.

272   
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
there exists a function H(x, y, p) on 
such that
Let us consider the d-tensor field
We can prove:
Proposition 11.1.1. A necessary condition for a generalized Hamilton metric
of order two to be reducible to a Hamilton metric of order two is that the d–tensors
is totally symmetric.
Theorem 11.1.1. Let 
be a 0–homogeneous GH–metric with respect to
Then a necessary and sufficient condition that it to be reducible to an H–metric
is that the d–tensor field 
is totally symmetric.
Proof. If there exists a GH–metric 
reducible to a H–metric, i.e. (1.1) holds,
then 
is totally symmetric (Proposition 11.1.1.).
Conversely, assuming that 
is 0–homogeneous with respect to 
taking
into account the formula 
and the fact that
is totally symmetric, it  follows 
 q.e.d.
Remark. Let 
be a Riemannian metric. Then it is not difficult to prove that
the d–tensor field
is a GH–metric which is not reducible to an H–metric of order two, provided
does not vanishes .
The covariant tensor field 
is obtained from the equations
Of course, 
is a symmetric, nondegenerate and covariant of order two, d-tensor
field.

Indeed, the d-tensors 
have the properties (1.6). By a direct calculus we
can prove (1.5) taking into account of (1.3).

Remarks.
1° The tensors 
and 
are the 
– 
–covariant derivatives of the funda-
mental tensor field 
respectively.
2° The tensors 
and 
are the 
and 
–coefficients of a canonical metrical
N–linear connection D, respectively.
Some particular cases
1. Let 
be the fundamental tensor field of a Finsler space
and let 
be its contravariant tensor field. Let us consider 
defined
on 
by
The tensors 
are given by the first formula (1.4) and by
It follows 
The GH–metric 
has the covariant metric
reducible to a particular metric:
We have:
Theorem 11.1.3. The nonlinear connection N of the space
has the coefficients:
They are determined only on the fundamental function of the Finsler space
Proof. The tensors 
is exactly the Cartan non–linear connection and 
is its
Berwald connection. A straightforward calculus shows that the rule of transforma-
tion of 
is exactly (3.10), Ch. 6. 
q.e.d.
2. Let 
be the fundamental tensor field of a Cartan space
[97]. It follows 
 and therefore we obtain that H is 1–homogeneous
with respect to

274
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
We consider the extension 
of the tensor 
to
The tensor         vanishes and
 is given by the second formula (1.4), where
In this case, we can determine a nonlinear connection N depending only by the
fundamental tensor 
[see Ch.6]. Indeed, let 
the Christoffel symbols of
and let us put
Theorem 11.1.4. 
The space 
determined by the Cartan
space 
has a nonlinear connection N with the following coefficients deduced only
from
To a generalized Hamilton space of order two 
we associate the
Hamilton absolute energy
and consider the d-tensor field
The space 
is called weakly regular if:
We can prove the following fact:
The weakly regular          –spaces have a nonlinear connection N depending only
on the fundamental tensor field
11.2 Metrical connections in
–spaces
If a nonlinear connection N, with the coefficients 
is a priori given, let us
consider the direct decomposition (see (5.2), Ch.7):
and the adapted basis to it, 
where

Ch.11. Generalized Hamilton spaces of order 2 
 275
The dual adapted basis is 
where
An N–linear connection 
determines the h–,
covariant derivatives in the tensor algebra of d–tensor fields.
Definition 11.2.1. An N–linear connection 
is called metrical with respect
to GH–metric 
if
In the case when 
is positively defined we can introduce the lengths of a
d-covector field Xi by
The following property is not difficult to prove:
Theorem 11.2.1. An N–linear connection 
is metrical with respect to GH–
metric 
if and only if along to any smooth curve 
  and for any
parallel d-covector field X, 
we have
The tensorial equations (2.4) imply:
Now, using the same technique as in the case of  Ch. 5, we can prove the following
important result:
Theorem 11.2.2.
1. There exists a unique N–linear connection 
having
the properties:
1°. The nonlinear connection N is a priori given.
2°. 
is metrical with respect to GH–metric 
i.e. (2.6) are verified.
3°. The torsion tensors 
and 
vanish.
2. The previous connection has the coefficients 
and 
given by (1.4) and
 are the generalized Christoffel symbols:

276 
  The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
The known Obata’s operators, are given by
They are the supplementary projectors on the module of d-tensor fields
Also, they are covariant constants with respect to any metrical connection
Exactly as in Ch.5, we can prove:
Theorem 11.2.3. The set of all N–linear connections
which are metrical with respect to 
is given by
where 
is given by (1.4), (2.7) and 
are arbitrary
d-tensor  fields.
Corollary 11.2.1. The mapping 
determined by (2.9) and the
composition of these mappings is an Abelian group.
Remark. It is important to determine the geometrical object fields invariant to the
previous group of transformations of metrical connections [105].
From Theorem 11.2.3 we can deduce:
Theorem 11.2.4. There exists a unique metrical connection
with 
respect 
to 
GH–metric 
having 
the 
torsion 
d–tensor 
fields
a priori given. The coefficients of 
are given by the following
formulas
We obtain:

Ch.11. Generalized Hamilton spaces of order 2 
277
We can introduce the notions of Rund connection, Berwald connection and Ha-
shiguchi connection as in Chapter 2, and prove the existence of a commutative
diagram from the mentioned chapter.
Finally, if we denote 
etc., then applying the Ricci identitiesto
and taking into account the equations (1.6), we get
Theorem 11.2.5. 
The curvature tensor fields 
etc. are skew
symmetric in the indices h, i.
11.3 
The lift of a GH–metric
Let the nonlinear connection N be given, then the adapted basis 
and its
dual basis 
can be determined.
Therefore, a generalized Hamilton space of order two 
allows
to introduce the N–lift:
defined in every point
Theorem 11.3.1.
1°. The N–lift 
is a nonsingular tensor field on the manifolds 
symmet-
ric, of type (0,2) depending only by the GH–metric 
and by the nonlinear
connection N.
2°. The pair 
is a (pseudo)–Riemannian space.
3°. The distributions N, 
are orthogonal with respect to 
respectively.
Indeed, every term from (3.1) is defined on 
because 
 is a d-tensor field,
and 
have the rule of transformations (5.6)", Ch. 9. The determinant of
is equal to the determinant of matrix 
Hence det 
Now it is clear
that 
is a (pseudo)–Riemannian metric. And it is evident that the distributions
N, 
  are orthogonal with respect to 
respectively.
The tensor 
is of the form
Here 
is the restriction of the metric 
to the distribution H, 
is its restriction
to 
and 
is its restriction to the distribution 
Moreover
are d-tensor fields.

278 
  The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
It is not difficult to prove:
Theorem 11.3.2. The tensors 
are covariant constant with respect
to any metrical N–linear connection
Therefore, the equation 
is equivalent to
The same property holds for the d-tensors
The geometry of the (pseudo)–Riemannian space 
can be studied by
means of a metrical N-linear connection.
Let IF be the natural almost contact structure determined by N and is given in
the section 8, Ch.9.
Theorem 11.3.3. The pair (
IF) is a Riemannian almost contact structure de-
termined only by GH–metric 
and by the nonlinear connection N.
Proof. In the adapted basis 
it follows that the equation
is verified.
The 2-form associated to the structure (     IF) is given by
Since 
we get that
In the local adapted basis 
 has the expression:
Theorem 11.3.4. The 2-form 
determines an almost presymplectic structure on
the manifold 
It is not an integrable structure if the metric 
depends on the
moments
Indeed, 
is a 2-form of rank 2n < 3n and for 
the exterior diferential
of does not vanish.
The last theorem suggests to consider another almost contact Riemannian struc-
ture on
In order to do this, let us consider some new geometrical object fields on

Ch.11. Generalized Hamilton spaces of order 2 
   279
Let us define the 
–linear mapping
given in the local adapted basis by
Theorem 11.3.5. The mapping 
has the following properties:
1°. 
is globally defined on
2°. 
is a tensor field of type (1, 1) on
3°. Ker 
Im
4°. rank
5°.
The proof is completely similar with the one of exactly like Theorem 9.8.2. The
mapping 
will be called the (p)–almost contact structure determined by 
 and
by N. The Nijenhuis tensor of the (p)–almost contact structure is
and the condition of normality of 
is as follows
The relation (8.3) can be explicitely written in adapted basis.
Theorem 11.3.6. The pair 
is a Riemannian almost contact structure de-
termined by 
and by N.
Indeed, we have verified the property:
The 2-form associated to 
is

280                                                               The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
As we know, if the torsion
of the nonlinear connection vanishes
(Ch.9), then we have:
Hence for
the 2-form
is canonical presymplectic structure. It does not
depend on the nonlinear connection N (see, Theorem 9.1.3).
Theorem 11.3.7. The associated 2-form 
of the almost contact structure
has the properties:
1°. 
is globally defined on
2°. rank
3°. 
 depends by 
and by N.
4°.
defines an almost presymplectic structure on
5°. If the torsion 
of the nonlinear connection N vanishes, then 
is canonical
presymplectic structure:
6°. 
is covariant constant to any N–linear connection
The Riemannian almost contact space
will be called the geomet-
rical model of the generalized Hamilton space
11.4 Examples of spaces
We shall consider a generalized Hamilton space of order two,
whose fundamental tensor is as follows:
where 
is the fundamental tensor of a Finsler space 
is its
contraviant tensor field and 
 is a smooth function.
In the particular case where 
and 
is a Lorentz metric,
this structure was used for a constructive axiomatic theory of General Relativity by
R. Miron and R. Tavakol [121].
In the adapted basis    is given by

If 
is a locally Minkowski Finsler space and 
then (4.1) gives a
class of a generalized P.L. Antonelli and H. Shimada metric [19].
In order to study the 
spaces with the metric (4.1) in the general case
when the d–vector field 
does not vanish, we prove at the beginning that this
metric is not reducible to an H–metric.
Theorem 11.4.1. The generalized Hamilton space of order two with the metric
(4.1) is not reducible to an Hamilton space of order two.
Proof. Taking into account Proposition 11.1.1 is sufficiently to prove that  if
then the tensor field 
is not totally symmetric. 
 q.e.d.
From the formula (4.1), we deduce
Consequently, 
is totally symmetric if and only if
Let us consider the Cartan nonlinear connection of the Finsler space 
with the
coefficients
Thus, using Theorem 11.1.3, we can a priori take the nonlinear
connection N with the coefficients (1.7) as the nonlinear connection of the considered
space
Proposition 11.4.1. The nonlinear connection N, with the coefficients
from the formulas (1.7) depend only on the GH–metric (4.1).
Now we can determine the metrical connection 
of the space 
using
Theorem 11.2.3. This metrical N–linear connection will be called canonical.
It is not difficult to prove:
Theorem 11.4.2. The canonical metrical connection 
of the space
with fundamental tensor field (4.1), has the coefficients:
where 
is the Cartan metrical connection of the Finsler space
Now, applying the theory from the previous chapters and using Theorem 11.4.2,
we can develop the geometry of  the spaces 
 with the metric (4.1). For instant,
we can write the structure equations of the canonical connections (4.2), etc.

Other important example suggested by the Relativistic Optics is given by the
following GH–metric of order two:
where

and 
is contravariant tensor of a
fundamental tensor field 
of a Finsler space
In this case we can prove that 
with the metric (4.3), is not reducible to
a Hamilton space of order two.
Taking into account the nonlinear connection N with coefficients (1.7) we can
determine, by means of Theorem 11.2.3, a canonical metrical connection
depending only by the considered space
As a final example, we can study by the previous methods ”the Antonelli–
Shimada metric” defined in the preferential charts of an atlas on the manifold
by
where
Finally, we remark that the theory exposed in this chapter will be useful in the next
chapters for study the geometry of Hamilton spaces of order two.

Chapter 12
Hamilton spaces of order 2
The theory of dual bundle ( 
M) mentioned in the last three Chapters
allows to study a natural extension to order two of the notion of Hamilton spaces
studied in the Chapters 4,5,6. A Hamilton space of order two is a pair
(M, H(x, y, p)) formed by a real, n-dimensional smooth manifold M and a regular
Hamiltonian function 
The geometry of the
spaces 
can be constructed step by step following the same ideas as in the
classical case of the spaces 
by using the geometry of manifold
endowed with an regular Hamiltonian H(x, y, p).
12.1 
The spaces
Let us consider again a differentiable manifold M, real and of dimension n and the
dual bundle 
of the 2-osculator bundle
Definition 12.1.1. A regular Hamilton of order two is a function
differentiable on 
and continuous on the zero section of the projection
whose Hessian, with entries
is nondegenerate.
In other words, the following condition holds
Moreover, since 
being a d-tensor field, of type (2, 0), the condition (1.1)´
has geometrical meaning.
283

284 
The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Of course, if the base manifold M is paracompact, then on 
there exist the
regular Hamiltonians.
The d–tensor 
is symmetric and contravariant. Its covariant d-tensor field
will be denoted by 
and it is given by the elements of the matrix
Hence we have:
Definition 12.1.2. A Hamilton space of order two is a pair
where H is a regular Hamiltonian having the property that the tensorfield
has a constant signature on the manifold
As usually, H is called the fundamental function and 
fundamental tensor field
of the Hamilton space or order two,
In the case when the fundamental tensor field 
is positively defined, then the
condition (1.1)´ is verified.
Theorem 12.1.1. If the manifold M is paracompact then always exists a regular
Hamiltonian H such that the pair (M, H) gives rise to a Hamilton space of order
two.
Proof. Let 
be a Finsler space having 
as fundamental
tensor. Then, the function defined on the manifold 
by
is a regular Hamiltonian or order two, and the pair 
is an Ha-
milton space of order two. Its fundamental tensor is 
Obvi-
ously,
M 
being 
paracompact, 
a 
Finsler 
space
= (M, F(x, y)) exists and therefore H(x, y, p) exists. 
    q.e.d.
One of the important d-tensor field derived from the fundamental function H of
the space 
is:
Proposition 12.1.1. We have:
1° 
is a totally symmetric d-tensor field.
2° 
vanishes, if and only if the fundamental tensor field 
does not depend
on the momenta

Ch.12. Hamilton spaces of order 2 
285
Other geometrical object fields which are entirely determined by means of the
Hamiltonian of order two, H(x, y, p), are the 
and 
coefficients of a metrical
connection, respectively.
Theorem 12.1.2. The d-tensor fields
have the following properties:
1° They depend only on the fundamental function H.
2° They are symmetric in the indices jk.
3° The formula
holds.
4° They are the coefficients of the 
and 
metrical connection. So we get:
The proof is not difficult.
The curvature d-tensor fields 
and 
expressed in formulae (6.4)",
Ch.10, depend only on the fundamental function H.
The 
and 
paths of the Hamilton space of order two are given by
Theorem 10.7.5, respectively. Namely
Theorem 12.1.3.
1° The 
paths of the space 
in the point 
are characte-
rized by the system of differential equations
2° The 
of the space 
in the point 
are characterized by
the system of differential equations
The horizontal paths of the Hamilton space of order two will be studied after a
canonical nonlinear connection will be introduced.

12.2 Canonical presymplectic structures and ca-
nonical Poisson structures
As we know on the total space 
of the dual of 2-osculator bundle there exist
different remarkable canonical structures and object fields. Namely:
where 
is a presymplectic structure on 
of rank 2n.
There exist, also, the canonical Poisson structures 
and 
defined for any
by
Each of these Poisson brackets are invariant with respect to changes of coor-
dinates on the manifold 
they are 
with respect to each argument,
skewsymmetric, satisfies the Jacobi identities and the mapping
is a derivation in algebra of the functions
Proposition 12.2.1. The following identities hold:
1°
2° For any 
we have:

Ch.12. Hamilton spaces of order 2 
 287
Assuming that the manifold 
is endowed with a regular Hamiltonian H
such that 
is an Hamilton space of order two, we get an Hamiltonian
system of order 1 given by the triple (T*2 M, H (x, y, p), θ) and we can treat it by the
classical methods [cf. M. de Leon and Gotay [85]]. In this case, evidently only the
Poisson structure 
will be considered.
Therefore we will study the induced canonical symplectic structures and the
induced Poisson structures on the submanifolds 
and 
of the manifold
where 
and 
will be described below.
Let us consider the bundle 
and its canonical section,

Then, the following 
mapping

A glance at the formula (2.8)´, gives:
Proposition 12.2.2. The mapping 
is an isomorphism.

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Let us consider the space 
and denote 
Then
the pair (M, 
) is a classical Hamilton space (see Ch. 5) having the funda-
mental tensor field
The Proposition 12.2.2 shows that there exists a unique vector field
such that
In local basis, we get

The integral curves of the vector field 
are given by the

Theorem 12.2.3. The following formula holds
Proof. Indeed, we have
Now, taking a canonical 2-form 
on the fibres of the bundle 
we
can obtain a similar relation for the Poisson structure

For two functions f, 
let

Ch.12. Hamilton spaces of order 2 
289
We can prove, without difficulties, that the following expressions give rise to
geometrical object fields on the manifold
Consequently, we get:
Theorem 12.2.4. The following properties hold:
1° 
is canonical symplectic structure on the manifold
2° 
is a canonical Poisson structure on
The relationship between these two canonical structures can be deduced by the
same techniques in the case of the pair of structures
Indeed, the mapping
defined by
has the properties
Proposition 12.2.3. 
is an isomorphism.
That means that there exists an unique vector field 
such that
where 
is the regular Hamiltonian,
Locally, 
is given by
and its integral curve are as follows

The Geometry of Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
These are called ”the 
-canonical equations” of the space 
Therefore, we can
state:
Theorem 12.2.5. The integral curve of the vector field 
are given by the
canonical equations (2.18).
Finally, we can prove:
Theorem 12.2.6. The following formula holds
The previous theory shows the intimate relations between symplectic structures
and the Poisson structure 
on the manifolds
12.3 
Lagrange spaces of order two
We shall prove the existence of a natural diffeomorphism between the Hamilton
space of order two,
and the Lagrange spaces of order two
To this purpose, we shall briefly sketch the general
theory of the space 
(see, §1,2, Ch.6, of the book [106]). The fundamental
function of the space 
is a Lagrangian of order two,
which is regular and the fundamental tensor field
has a constant signature.
On the manifold 
there exist two distribution 
and 
The distribution
is the vertical distribution of dimension 2n and 
 Clearly,
A transformation of local coordinates on

where
Of course, for every point 
the natural basis of the tangent
space 
transforms as:
By means of these formulae one can prove that the vector fields
determine a local basis of the distribution 
and
is a local basis of the vertical distribution 
These distributions are integrable and
Let us remark that there are two Liouville vector fields:
with the properties that 
belongs to the distribution 
and 
belongs to the

are linear independent.
There exists a 2-tangent structure J, on

Noticing that

Some of the previous results hold even in the case when L is not a regular Lagran-
gian. If L is the fundamental function of a Lagrange space of order 2,

Now, applying the theory from Ch.9, we can write the structure equations of the
metrical N-connection 
Ricci identities and Bianchi identities. The paral-
lelism theory as well as, the theory of the special curves, horizontal paths etc. can
be obtained.
We can conclude that the geometry of the second order Hamilton spaces, can be
constructed from the canonical connections N and
The geometrical model of the space 
is determined the N-lift 
((3.1),
Ch.11) of the fundamental tensor 
and by the (p)-almost contact structure

We obtain, without difficulties:
Theorem 12.8.2. The pair 
is a Riemannian almost contact structure de-
termined only by canonical nonlinear connection N and by fundamental function H
of the space 
If N is torsion free (i.e. 
), then its associated 2-form
is canonical presymplectic structure

Canonical presymplectic structure of space
The natural geometrical object fields on the manifolds 
in the case of Cartan
space of order two, together with the fundamental function K(x, y, p) of space
give rise to some important properties, especially in the case of canonical equations

It is clear that the Jacobi method, described in Section 2, ch.4, for
integration of  the equations (2.8), can be used in this case.
Now, let

Cartan space of order two, 
Then the canonical nonlinear
connection N of the space 
will be called the canonical nonlinear connection

Therefore, we can apply the theory from the section 7 of
the previous chapter.

Now, using an already very known method, we can prove:
Theorem 13.4.1.
1) In a Cartan space of order two, 
there exists a unique N-linear
connection 
which verifies the following axioms:
1° N is the canonical nonlinear connection with coefficients (3.11).
2°
is metrical with respect to fundamental tensor
  of space
i.e.
3° The d-tensor of  torsion 
vanish.
2)  This connection has the coefficients:
The N-connection
(4.3), is called the canonical metrical connection of
the space
Let us consider the covariant curvature tensors (6.5)', Ch.10 of 
Then,
applying the Ricci identities (see 9.7) to the covariant of fundamental tensor field,
and taking into account the equations
we obtain:
Theorem 13.4.2. The tensors of  curvature 
and
are skew–symmetric in the first two indices.
The (y)–deflection tensors of 
are given by (5.5)', ch.10, and (p)–deflection
of the same connection are

316
The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Now, let us solve the problem of determination of a metrical N-linear connection
for which the p-deflection tensor 
vanishes.
Theorem 13.4.3.
1) In a Cartan space 
there exists a unique N-linear connection
for which the following axioms hold:
1° 
and the coefficients 
of the nonlinear connection
are given a priori.
2° 
is metrical with respect to 
i.e. (4.2) holds.
2) 1°. The coefficients 
of 
are given by (4.3).
2°. The coefficients 
of the nonlinear connection N are expressed by:
where
 are the Christoffel symbols of                  and the index ”0”
means the contraction by 
or by
Proof. If the nonlinear connection N 
is known, then The-
orem 13.4.1 can be applied and it follows the existence and uniqueness of the coef-
ficients 
from (4.3) which satisfy the axioms 2° and 3°. Let us
determine the coefficients 
of N in the condition of  axiom 1°, i.e.
Taking into account (4.4), 
is equivalent to 
Since the
operators 
have the expressions
the equations
leads to
Thus

A new contraction by 
leads to
Substituting in the formula (4.7) we have the solution (4.5) of  the equation
and the theorem is proved. 
q.e.d.
For the canonical metrical connection 
(4.3) the Ricci identities are given
in Theorem 10.6.1, taking into account the axiom 3°, i.e.:
The torsions are given by (6.3), (6.3)'' and the curvature tensors are expressed by
(6.4) and (6.4)'.
Theorem 10.6.3 gives some important identities for 
in which we take
into account (4.6) and (4.4).

Parallelism of  vector fields. Structure equa-
tions of
Let us consider the canonical metrical connection 
(4.3), and let
be a smooth parameterized curve as in section 7, Ch.10.
For a vector field 
given in the adapted basis 
by
the covariant differential DX is expressed by:
where the 1-forms of connection 
of the Cartan space of order two are:
Therefore, Theorem 10.7.1 gives the necessary and sufficient condition for the paral-
lelism of vector field X, (5.1) with respect to 
along the parametrized curve
Theorem 10.7.2 states that the Cartan space 
is with the absolute parallelism
of  vectors if, and only if, all d–tensors of  curvature vanish:

318
The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
We recall Theorem 10.7.3, also:
Theorem 13.5.1. A smooth parametrized curve
is  autoparallel
with respect to the canonical metrical connection
of Cartan space 
if
and only if the system of differential equations (7.13), Ch.7, is verified.
Of course, a theorem of existence and uniqueness for the autoparallel curve one
can formulate without difficulties.
Taking into account Theorem 10.3.3, and (7.15), Ch.10, we get:
Theorem 13.5.2. The horizontal paths of  the canonical metrical connection
of the space 
are characterized by the system of differential equations:
Finally, Theorem 10.7.5 has as consequence:
Theorem 13.5.3.
1° The 
–vertical paths of 
in the point 
is characterized by the
system of differential equations
2° The 
–vertical paths of 
in the point 
is characterized by
Remark. We assume that the restrictions of the coefficients 
to the zero section
of 
exist.
The structure equations of the canonical metrical connection 
of the Car-
tan space of order two, 
are given in the section 7 of Ch.7,
taking into account the particular properties of  this connection.
So, we obtain:
Theorem 13.5.4. The canonical metrical connection 
of the Cartan space
of order two, 
has the following structure equations:

Ch.13. Cartan spaces of  order 2 
319
and
where the 2-forms of torsion 
and 2-forms of curvature 
are given by
the formulae (8.6), ch.7, and (4.8).
The Bianchi identities of the connection 
can be obtained taking the
exterior differential of the system of equations (5.4), (5.5) modulo the same system.
Remark. Using the structure equations, we can study, without major difficulties,
the theory of Cartan subspaces of order two in a Cartan space
13.6 
Riemannian almost contact structure of a
space
Consider a Cartan space of order two, 
and its canonical
nonlinear connection N, with coefficients 
from (3.11). The adapted basis
and its dual 
are determined by N.
The associated 
space of 
is uniquely determined.
Therefore, using the theory from section 3, ch.11, we can investigate the notion of
Riemannian almost contact structure of the space
We introduce the N-lift to 
of the fundamental tensor 
by:
which is defined in every point
Theorem 13.6.1.
1° 
is a tensor field on the manifold 
  of type (0, 2), nonsingular depending
only on the fundamental function K of 
 and by the nonlinear connection
2° The pair 
is a Riemannian space.
3° The distributions N, 
are respectively orthogonal with respect to
Proof. Since 
and 
are d-tensor fields, symmetric and positively defined, it
follows that 
has the properties 1°, 2° and 3°.
Applying Theorem 11.3.2, we deduce:

320
The Geometry of  Hamilton & Lagrange Spaces
Theorem 13.6.2. 
The tensor 
is covariant constant with respect to canonical
metrical connection 
of the space 
i.e.
In other words, the canonical metrical connection 
 is an N-linear metrical
connection with respect to the Riemannian structure
Let us consider the 
-linear mapping
defined by
Theorem 13.6.3. The mapping 
has the following properties:
1° 
is globally defined on
2°
is a tensor field of type (1, 1) on           i.e.
3° ker
4° rank
5°
The proof  is exactly like the case of  Theorem 9.8.2.
Hence, 
is called the (p)-almost contact structure determined by 
 and by
The Nijenhuis tens or
and the condition of normality of 
can be explicitely
written in adapted basis (see ch.11).
Now if we remark the tensor (6.3) and the fact that 
and 
are covariant
constant with respect to the canonical metrical connection, it follows:
Theorem 13.6.4. 
The tensor field 
is covariant constant with respect to the
canonical metrical connection 
i.e.
Finally, let us notice that the pair 
has some remarkable properties.

Ch.13. Cartan spaces of  order 2 
321
Theorem 13.6.5.
1°
The pair 
is a Riemannian almost contact structure on the manifold
determined only by the space 
and by the nonlinear connection
2° The tensor fields 
and 
are covariant constant with respect to canonical
metrical connection 
of the space
3°
The associated 2-form of the structure 
is the canonical presymplectic
structure on
Indeed, we have 
and
In adapted basis we get 
But the torsion
vanishes, hence as consequence 
and therefore Theorems 13.6.2 and
13.6.4 implies 2°, etc.
The Riemannian almost contact space 
is called the Riemannian
almost contact model of the Cartan space of order 2,
It is extremely useful in applications.
