Introduction
What is a warehouse?
A warehouse should be viewed as a temporary place to store 
inventory and as a buffer in supply chains.
It serves, as a static unit – in the main – matching product 
availability to consumer demand and as such has a primary 
aim which is to facilitate the movement of goods from 
suppliers to customers, meeting demand in a timely and  
cost-effective manner. 
adapted from Van den Berg (2013)
Primarily a warehouse should be a trans-shipment point where all goods 
received are despatched as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.
The basic processes of warehouse management remain the same over time. 
We receive goods into the warehouse, we process orders, we replenish, we in-
clude some value-adding services and then we despatch the product. Advances 
in warehousing tend to relate to the increased use of technology and auto­
mation, improved performance measurement and the effective management 
of resources.
In the second edition of this book we have retained the core concept of 
discussing each warehouse process in turn together with putting the role of the 
warehouse into context within the overall supply chain.
However, in this edition we have increased the number of case studies from 
companies who have achieved improvements and cost savings through the 
introduction of new technology and equipment, leaner processes and environ-
mental initiatives.
The saying goes that a picture paints a thousand words, so in this edition we 
include more photographs of the equipment and also links to videos where you 
can see the equipment and technology in action.

equipment or process discussed: 
The warehouse continues to play a major role within supply chains and will 
continue to do so for the foreseeable future, although these warehouses will 
appear in different guises.
The growth in fulfilment centres for e-commerce, for example, is certainly 
changing the warehousing landscape. Finished stock needs to be held as close to 
the point of consumption as possible to reduce ever increasing transportation 
costs and to meet increasingly demanding customer delivery requirements. This 
has led to many warehouses transforming into cross-dock and transhipment 
centres, fulfilment centres, sortation and consolidation points, reverse logistics 
centres as well as fulfilling their roles as storage facilities.
As a result, managers need to have a greater understanding of the various 
roles that warehouses can fulfil and how these affect the business and the supply 
chain as a whole.
No two operations are exactly the same, even within the same company, 
although the underlying principles remain. This book aims to share these prin-
ciples and enable managers to get a better understanding of how to achieve 
best-in-class status.
This book aims to further update readers on current and potential future 
advances in warehouse management whilst tackling the issues that are chal-
lenging today’s managers.
These include the pressure on managers to increase productivity, reduce 
cost, improve customer service at least cost to the environment whilst ensuring 
the health and safety of staff employed in the warehouse.
The author and contributors have a number of years’ experience in manag-
ing and consulting on warehouse operations. This book is written from the 
perspective of hands-on operators and aims to share past experiences and 
knowledge gathered over recent years.
Having moved into consultancy, the author is continually updating his 
knowledge in this rapidly changing sector of logistics. This book also draws on 
the knowledge and experience of colleagues and the results of recent bench-
marking studies and surveys from Europe and the United States.
Warehouses evolve. Technology has moved on apace and as a result, oppor-
tunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness within the warehouse are con-
stantly being introduced. This, together with increasing demands from customers 
and internal pressures to reduce costs yet improve service levels, can prove a 
significant challenge to warehouse and logistics managers everywhere.
The introduction of sophisticated automation, robotics and advanced software 
systems into warehouse operations can potentially have an effect on logistics 
operations comparable to the introduction of the wheel millennia ago. These

advances in technology are likely to lead to a significant reduction in staff and 
improved efficiency. This comes at a cost, however.
Not all warehouse operations are likely to benefit from such advances or 
can afford large investments in technology. This book will examine the basic 
processes required to manage a warehouse effectively. In fact, these processes 
need to be in place in all warehouses prior to any thoughts of introducing new 
technology.
Automating a bad process might make it quicker but certainly doesn’t make it 
more efficient. The author recognizes the huge diversity of warehouse operations 
globally and although the book discusses current concepts and technologies it 
concentrates in the main on how all warehouses can become more efficient and 
effective, irrespective of budget.
Logistics is very much about trade-offs. This book will examine these in detail 
as they will affect how warehouse and logistics managers approach their jobs 
and the decisions they take.
Major trade-offs include:
●
●cost versus service;
●
●storage capacity versus speed of retrieval;
●
●speed versus accuracy;
●
●lower inventory versus availability;
●
●efficiency versus responsiveness; and
●
●volume purchases versus storage cost and availability.
These trade-offs appear both within the warehouse itself and also between the 
warehouse operation and other logistics services.
This book has been written in such a way that it will be a useful reference 
point for staff involved in the day-to-day operations of a warehouse; senior 
managers who require a basic understanding of warehouses; designers and 
planners; external agencies needing a basic understanding; and, finally, those 
who are considering a career in warehousing and logistics.
Through the use of case studies and examples, the author shares fundamental 
tools and processes that have been prevalent in the industry over the years and 
have been instrumental in assisting managers to increase efficiency and reduce 
costs.
The book concentrates on the areas that challenge today’s warehousing and 
logistics managers. These include:
●
●improving efficiency and productivity whilst reducing costs;
●
●improving quality and accuracy;
●
●reduced lead times from customers;

●
●technological advancements;
●
●workforce availability and management;
●
●health and safety; and
●
●effects on the environment.
Chapters 1 and 2 of the book discuss the roles of the warehouse and ware-
house manager in today’s supply chain. Within these chapters we also examine 
one of the main challenges for warehouse managers – attracting and retaining 
quality staff.
Chapters 3 to 7 analyse the individual processes within the warehouse, 
outlining areas where costs can be reduced whilst productivities increase 
through the use of technology and improved methods.
Chapters 8 to 10 explore in detail equipment utilized within the warehouse, 
including warehouse management systems, handling and storage equipment.
Chapters 11 and 12 discuss how to resource and calculate the costs of a 
warehouse.
Chapters 13 and 14 look at performance measurement in detail and also the 
opportunities afforded by outsourcing.
Chapters 15 and 16 provide an insight into areas that currently take up a 
significant percentage of a manager’s time today. These include health and safety 
and the continuing pressure on companies to reduce the effects of logistics 
operations on the environment.
The final chapter looks at current advances in warehousing and attempts to 
predict the future.
The book has been written by a UK-based author and has contributors from 
both the United Kingdom and the United States. They have all worked and 
lectured in many different countries. It is hoped that this book will be read 
globally and that the information provided will resonate with warehouse 
operators, students and management teams worldwide.
Books such as this are an excellent resource for today’s managers. However, 
they need to be used in conjunction with other, easily accessible resources. 
These include your peers, staff on the warehouse floor, the suppliers of ware-
house equipment and consultants – all of whom have a wealth of experience to 
share with today’s managers.

The role of  
the warehouse
If I don’t have room for an item I put it in warehouses.
Ursula Andress (1936–)
Introduction
Warehouses have, in the past, been constantly referred to as cost centres and 
rarely adding value. The movement of production to the Far East, the growth 
of e-commerce and increasing demands from consumers has seen a step change 
in warehouse operations. Warehouses are now seen as a vital link within today’s 
supply chains. In fact, as stated in a recent survey by Motorola (2013):
fewer organizations continue to view warehouses and DCs simply as commoditized 
links between endpoints of the supply chain. Warehouses are no longer necessary 
evils that are fundamentally cost centers. The movement from linear to complex, 
multi-node supply chains recognizes this shift in perception, and is being driven 
by greater volatility, constrained capacity, evolving regulations, major shifts in 
customer demographics and buying patterns, and increasingly demanding customer 
and supplier requirements. Warehouses today can drive competitive differentiation 
and, by doing so, increase profitable growth.
The pressure remains on managers to increase productivity and accuracy, reduce 
cost and inventory whilst improving customer service.
As an introduction to the main aspects of the book we set the context by 
examining the role of the warehouse in today’s economy and its likely place 
within future supply chains.
We will also look at the factors involved in choosing a suitable location for 
a warehouse and how many warehouses might be required.
We have also taken three examples of specialist warehousing and expanded 
on these. We realize there are other areas such as hazardous goods storage and 
maintenance stores, but the need to cover all the fundamental areas precludes 
us from going into these areas in detail.

We believe, however, that the same underlying principles apply, albeit with 
greater emphasis on both legal and safety aspects. The role of a supply chain  
is to deliver the right products, in the correct quantity, to the right customer,  
at the right place, at the right time, in the right condition, at the right price.
The warehouse plays a significant part in this. Delivering the right product 
in the right quantity relies on the warehouse picking and despatching products 
accurately. Delivering to the right customer at the right place, on time, requires 
the product to be labelled correctly and loaded onto the right vehicle with 
sufficient time to meet the delivery deadline. The warehouse also has to ensure 
the product leaves the warehouse clean and damage free. Finally, at the right 
price requires a cost-efficient operation that delivers value for money.
The warehouse is therefore crucial in delivering the perfect order. This can 
be done in many ways.
In the past, warehouses were seen mainly as stockholding points, attempting 
to match supply to demand and acting as a buffer between raw material and 
component suppliers and the manufacturers and between the manufacturers 
and the wholesalers and retailers and/or consumers. Stock visibility along the 
supply chain was limited and information flow was very slow, resulting in 
companies holding more stock than necessary.
Warehouses also fulfilled a major role in storing raw materials. As land and 
buildings were relatively cheap, the cost of holding significant quantities of 
raw materials and finished stock was seen as the norm and totally acceptable.
Production runs in those days were very long as it was an expensive process 
to change models, colours, styles, etc. The economy was also seen as supply 
driven with manufacturers producing products in the hope that retailers would 
stock them and consumers would buy them.
As a result there was a large proliferation of warehouses and stockholding 
increased appreciably.
In today’s market with expensive land, buildings, labour and energy costs, 
together with the introduction of concepts such as just in time (JIT), efficient 
consumer response (ECR) and quick response (QR), companies are continually 
looking to minimize the amount of stock held and speed up throughput. The 
use of tools such as postponement – where products are completed in the ware-
house, not at the manufacturing location – are becoming common place.
We have gone from a ‘push’ to a ‘pull’ supply chain over recent years. In fact, 
the phrase ‘supply chain’ can be a bit of a misnomer and rather it should be 
called a demand chain, with consumers holding sway.
In the past, manufacturers produced goods and passed them on to the retailers, 
expecting them to sell as many of their products as possible. The manufacturers 
operated a large number of local warehouses and delivered product direct to store.
This situation changed in the 1980s when retailers took partial control of their 
supply chains and began to build national and regional distribution centres. This 

The Role of the Warehouse

changed the face of warehousing with a move towards larger, multi-temperature 
sites owned by the retailers and in many situations operated by third-party 
logistics companies.
These sites continue to grow, with Tesco recently building a 1.2 million square 
foot warehouse at Teesport in the United Kingdom, and Marks & Spencer have 
commissioned a 900,000 square foot distribution centre at London Gateway, 
the UK’s new super port. The location of these warehouses are also part of  
a movement towards port-centric logistics.
The trend towards outsourcing Western production to India and Asia has 
resulted in companies having to hold higher levels of finished goods stock than 
previously. This is to cover the extended lead time between production and 
final delivery.
Containers from Shanghai to the United Kingdom, for example, can take 
upwards of 31 days, not including clearance at the port of entry. As can be seen 
in Figure 1.1, there is a requirement for some form of warehouse operation 
throughout the supply chain.
Types of warehouse operation
There are many different roles for a warehouse in today’s supply chain. As can 
be seen in Figure 1.1, warehouses can be operated by raw materials suppliers, 
component and finished goods manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and com-
panies involved in reverse logistics. The warehouses can be owner operated or 
subcontracted to third-party logistics providers.
These warehouses fulfil the following roles:
Raw materials storage
These warehouses store raw materials and components either close to the point 
of extraction or close to the manufacturing point. Raw materials must be held 
in order to ensure continuous production. These materials include plastics, 
precious metals, sand, aggregates, etc.
Intermediate, postponement, customization  
or sub-assembly facilities
These warehouses are used to store products temporarily at different stages 
in production. These centres are also used to customize products before final 
delivery to the customer.

Postponement and sub-assembly activities can include the following:
●
●specific packaging or labelling being changed or added, eg for store-
ready items or printing in different languages;
●
●computer assembly to include different graphics cards, memory chips, 
software, etc;
●
●product bundling for promotional activity;
●
●country-specific items being added such as electrical plugs; and
●
●special messages being added, eg stencilling of greetings messages on 
mobile phones.
Finished goods storage
These warehouses store products ready for sale, on behalf of manufacturers, 
wholesalers and retailers. They provide a buffer or safety stock for companies, 
enabling them to build up stock in preparation for new product launches, ex-
pected increases in demand and to deal with seasonality.

This video shows how Samsung products are moved through the supply 
chain via a number of finished goods warehouses including the store’s own 
warehouse.
Consolidation centres and transit warehouses
Consolidation centres receive products from different sources and amalgamate 
them for onward delivery to the customer or onto a production line. This can 
include just-in-time centres where automotive parts are delivered to a ware-
house where they are brought together and sequenced for delivery onto the 
production line.
They can also be retail stock consolidation warehouses where products 
from different suppliers are consolidated for onward delivery to the stores. 
Rather than deliver part-loads to the Retail Distribution Centres (RDC), manu­
facturers deliver to these facilities where their stock is consolidated with other 
suppliers for onward delivery to the RDC. These differ from cross-dock centres 
in that product can remain in the centre for a period of time awaiting call-off 
from the final destination. Many of these consolidation centres are operated by 
third parties.

Warehouse Management
10
Transhipment or break-bulk centres
Transhipment centres receive products in large quantities from suppliers and 
break them down into manageable quantities for onward delivery to various 
locations.
Cross-dock centres
Cross-dock centres are seen as being the future for warehousing. Efficient con-
sumer response and quick response within retail require operations to be able 
to move goods quickly through the supply chain. Cross docking requires deliv-
eries into these centres to be already labelled and ready for onward delivery. 
Here the items are identified and consolidated with other deliveries, ready for 
despatch. Items should remain in the warehouse for as short a time as possible. 
Same-day receipt and despatch is the target.
Although companies are beginning to realize the efficiency of cross docking, 
there are a number of barriers to a successful introduction. These can include 
warehouse management systems support, quality control systems, reliability 
and cooperation of suppliers and carriers, warehouse design and uncertain  
demand. Cross-dock warehouses or transhipment centres are also utilized in 
outlying geographic areas to transfer products onto local, radial distribution 
vehicles. This transhipment process can take place either inside or outside the 
warehouse. Typical cross-dock products are perishable items such as fruit and 
vegetables, meat and fish, which need to be moved quickly through the supply 
chain. Motorola’s recent study (2013) showed that 31 per cent of companies 
practised cross docking and this was expected to increase to 45 per cent by 2018.
Sortation centres
Sortation centres are used in the main by letter, parcel and pallet distribution 
companies. Goods are collected from all parts of the country, delivered into 
hubs or sortation centres, sorted by zip or post code, consolidated and delivered 
overnight to their respective distribution areas for onward delivery.
Today’s retailers are also moving towards automated sortation centres with 
pallets being de-layered on entry, the use of mini-load systems for temporary 
storage and retrieval and finally automated pallet build on exit.
Fulfilment centres
The growth of e-retailing has seen an increase in the number of customer fulfil-
ment centres. These warehouses have been designed and equipped specifically

to manage large volumes of small orders. The video shows the fulfilment 
operation of an internet retailer called i-herb.com.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAsl8-UQJFI (Dematic Corp)
These centres can also double up as returns processing centres as e-commerce 
has a larger percentage of returns than normal retail activities. This area is 
covered in greater detail later in this chapter.
Reverse logistics centres
The growth of e-retailing and specific environmental legislation such as the 
European Union’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive 
(2007) has compelled companies to focus time and energy on reverse logistics. 
Today, companies recognize that returning product to stock or disposing of it 
quickly can positively affect cash flow.
As a result, a number of warehouses have been set up specifically to deal 
with returned items. Third-party contractors are providing a service to retailers 
where customers return unwanted or defective items to the stores; the items are 
then consolidated and sent to the returns centre, where they are checked and 
either repackaged, repaired, recycled or disposed of.
Waste legislation has also resulted in large quantities of returned packaging 
having to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. This includes 
sortation by type and use as fuel or recycled material. There are case studies in 
the environmental section that go into more detail on this subject.
Other reverse logistics processes include the return of reusable transit pack-
aging equipment such as roll cages, barrels, kegs, pallets, tote boxes and trays. 
When used in the food industry added services include washing and sanitizing 
the items before they re-enter the supply chain.
For example, Norbert Dentressangle, a 3PL, service and maintain more than 
a million roll cages, as well as 230 million trays and flower buckets and dollies 
for Tesco.
Public sector warehousing
Outside the commercial world there are also warehouse operations which 
support the public sector, armed forces and the third sector.
The increasing number of natural disasters such as earthquakes, droughts 
and tsunamis is resulting in third-sector organizations opening up warehouses 
in strategic locations across the globe. This ensures that they are closer to the 
disaster areas and thus able to react quicker.

Warehouse Management
12
Other public sector warehouses will store supplies for local government 
facilities such as schools and offices. Products will include stationery, uniforms, 
furniture, computer hardware and software, etc.
All the warehouse operations mentioned above can be owned, leased or operated 
by third-party companies on behalf of a principal.
Warehouses operated by third-party logistics providers are either dedicated 
operations on behalf of a single customer or can be shared-user or public ware-
houses where a number of different customers share resources and are accom-
modated under one roof.
These include:
●
●companies with different products but with common customers such as 
retailers or automotive manufacturers;
●
●companies with the same or similar products delivering to common 
customers, eg tyre manufacturers; bicycle manufacturers, pharmaceutical 
companies and multimedia companies (a typical example is where  
Sony, Universal and Warner share a warehouse in the United Kingdom);
●
●companies needing similar types of service, eg fulfilment or returns 
processing; and
●
●companies requiring the same environmental conditions, eg hazardous 
goods, explosives or temperature controlled.
Users of shared-user warehouses are, in the main, companies looking for 
economies of scale through sharing facilities, equipment and labour costs.
Why do we hold stock?
A supply chain with the minimum amount of stock within its pipeline is utopia. 
Unfortunately this happens very rarely. Our society and our markets are not 
predictable and therefore we need to hold stock at various stages within the 
supply chain. Increased consumer demand for greater choice has resulted in  
a proliferation of product ranges and sizes leading to unprecedented demands 
on storage capacity.
Reasons for holding stock are as follows.
Uncertain and erratic demand patterns
Suppliers of ice cream, suntan lotion, umbrellas and the like will potentially 
experience erratic demand patterns based on the changeability of the weather. 
Other unpredictable sales can revolve around the launch of a new product and

baseball’s World Series events.
Trade-off between transport and shipping costs, 
justifying larger shipments
The ability to move product in large quantities tends to attract lower costs 
per unit. The trade-off here is between the cost of storing additional units 
compared with the higher cost of transport for smaller, groupage-type deliveries. 
If the transport cost is very attractive then additional storage space will be 
required. There also has to be a strong conviction that all the items purchased 
will be sold.
Discounts via bulk buying
The possibility of reducing the unit rate through buying in greater quantities is 
always an attractive proposition for buyers. This can, however, have a negative 
effect overall if the company fails to sell all of the additional units purchased 
or has to sell at a loss to clear the warehouse. In this situation it is our conten-
tion that the whole-life cost of the item is calculated before the decision is 
made to purchase additional quantities. These costs will include additional 
storage and handling costs, working capital interest, possible discounted sales 
and disposal costs. A trade-off exists between lower unit purchase costs and 
increased storage costs per unit. I’m sure there are many warehouses out there 
holding obsolete stock due to the overenthusiasm of procurement and sales 
staff!
Distance between manufacturer and the end consumer
As mentioned earlier, the distance finished stock has to travel today requires  
a greater amount of stock to be held in the warehouse. Lead times can be any-
thing between four and eight weeks depending on the manufacturer’s location. 
The trade-off here is between more expensive local suppliers and producers 
and increased costs in transport and inventory holding costs.
Cover for production shutdowns
Many manufacturing companies and sectors continue to shut down their  
operations for vacations, machine maintenance and stock counts. As a result 
retailers and wholesalers need to build up stock prior to the shutdown period 
to ensure stock availability for their customers. Manufacturers will also build 

Warehouse Management
14
up a stock of components to ensure that their production lines are not brought 
to a standstill as a result of supplier shutdowns.
Ability to increase production runs
Changing or adjusting production lines in order to accommodate changes in 
models, colour, design features, etc is expensive. The longer the production run, 
the lower the cost per unit to produce. However, the trade-off here is between 
the lower cost per unit versus the additional cost per unit for storage.
To manage seasonal production
Certain food and drink products are produced at specific times of the year and 
therefore need to be stored until required.
High seasonality
Seasonality can be a period of time such as summer and winter or a specific 
date in the calendar such as Easter, Valentine’s Day, Independence Day or the 
Chinese New Year. Figure 1.2 shows the stock build-up for a chocolate manu-
facturer in the run-up to Easter. As can be seen, pallet storage ranges from 
500 pallets to a staggering 10,000 pallets at peak.
Large sporting events can also have an impact on the requirement for addi-
tional storage. This includes the World Cup, the Olympics, Super Bowl final and 
World Series baseball, etc. Figure 1.3 shows the activity of a clothing manufac-
turer leading up to the two distinct seasons of summer and winter collections.
Spare parts storage
To ensure an uninterrupted production line operation, manufacturers need  
to hold stock of spare parts just in case an item becomes defective. This can  
be expensive but the trade-off here is between the cost of the part together with 
its holding cost and the potential breakdown of the production line and the 
consequences that brings with it. This doesn’t mean, however, that these 
items should not be reviewed regularly and decisions taken as to whether to 
stock them or not. Things to take into account include supplier lead time and 
machine failure rate.
Work-in-progress storage
Many companies will part-build products in anticipation of orders. The choco-
late manufacturer mentioned above produces the two halves of the Easter egg

prior to receiving any firm orders. This enables them to complete the process  
at a later date, once they know the type of packaging, style and insertions  
required.
Investment stocks
A number of products can increase in value the longer they are held in storage. 
These include fine wines and spirits, cigars, precious metals and stones, antiques 
and fine art.
Document storage
Both public bodies and private companies have an obligation to store documents 
over a period of time. These can include correspondence, invoices, accounts, etc. 
This can be a legal requirement. Other examples include evidence storage and 
patient records by the emergency services.
Warehouse location
Locating a warehouse strategically and in the most cost-effective geographic 
location is one of the most important decisions a company will make. For ex-
ample, in terms of fulfilment centres, because of the nature of deliveries, an 
important criteria is the need to be located near to the motorway network to 
delay the latest collection time from the parcel companies and therefore enable 
companies to introduce a later order cut-off time for next day delivery. Grocery 
retailers with online sales will have a requirement to be much closer to their cus-
tomers due to the different temperature regimes of the products being delivered.
The selection of a warehouse location requires multiple criteria to be assessed, 
including both quantitative and qualitative data.
Many companies will look at the location and size of customers which, 
although relevant, is not as important as it would be when locating a retail 
outlet. Other factors include land cost, labour availability, travel minimization 
and total cost. The environment will also play a part in the decision-making 
process. The following are specific factors that need to be taken into account 
when deciding on a warehouse location:
●
●cost of land, rent and rates;
●
●access to transport networks;
●
●availability of affordable skilled labour;
●
●transport links for staff;

The Role of the Warehouse
17
●
●availability of funding, grants, etc;
●
●availability of existing buildings;
●
●availability and cost of utilities including telecoms;
●
●availability of finance and resources;
●
●goods traffic flows;
●
●proximity to ports and airports;
●
●location of suppliers and manufacturing points; and
●
●the potential neighbours (eg proximity to oil storage depots can be  
a negative factor).
A recent report by DTZ (2013) stated that the global top five least expensive 
markets for warehousing are dominated by the Chinese Tier II cities of Wuhan, 
Shenyang and Chengdu, with Atlanta and Marseille completing the top five. 
Costs in all these markets are below US $70 per square metre per annum. 
Meanwhile, London Heathrow remains the most expensive area globally – at 
US $313 per square metre per annum, followed by Hong Kong, Zurich, Singapore 
and Oslo. Hong Kong is projected to see the biggest cost decline in the next five 
years, with occupiers continuing their migration to more affordable premises 
in mainland China.
In the Savills (2013) survey, the top nine requirements for e-retailing opera-
tions in terms of location were as follows:
●
●land/rent/lease costs;
●
●access to affordable labour;
●
●expansion space available;
●
●close proximity to parcel hub;
●
●close to motorway network;
●
●central location (covering all United Kingdom);
●
●close proximity to consumers;
●
●government incentive; and
●
●close proximity to higher skilled labour.
Fortunately the decision on where to site a warehouse does not have to be 
totally manual as there are a number of software programs available which 
will take the majority of these criteria into account and produce a number of 
viable alternatives.
Many of these systems work on the basis of volume centre of gravity calcu-
lations which locate the warehouse at the centre of supply and demand by 
minimizing distances to customers and from suppliers.

Warehouse Management
18
A more accurate method is to utilize the cost centre of gravity calculation 
which locates the warehouse at the centre of supply and demand by minimizing 
transport costs to customers and from suppliers.
Route planning and optimization software will produce a viable location; 
however, supply chain optimization tools will further enhance this decision.

Number of warehouses
There is an ongoing debate as to whether companies are going to increase or 
reduce the number of warehouse operated within the supply chain. A recent survey 
by Motorola showed that 35 per cent of the respondents planned to increase 
the number of warehouses operated whilst 36 per cent looked to increase the 
size of their existing facilities.
A survey by Savills (2013) in the UK showed that warehouse take-up by 
retailers only, will total 50 million square feet over the next five years and that 
is 21 per cent up on take-up in the last five years. Some 13 million square feet 
of this future take-up will be within e-tailing specific property, driven by online 
sales. There is no doubt that the move to multichannel retailing is having an 
effect on the number and size of locations operated.
The increasing cost of fuel, a move towards near-shoring and a requirement 
to be nearer the customer could see the number of local warehouses and distri-
bution centres increasing with cross-dock operations being favoured by more 
companies.
As with most areas of the supply chain there is a trade-off here. We can see 
from Table 1.1 that most costs are higher if multiple warehouses are chosen; 
however, all of these costs can be off-set by a significant reduction in local 
transportation costs and improved service.
In terms of inventory we need to be able to calculate by how much we will 
increase or reduce our safety stockholding when we change the number of 
warehouses operated.

The Role of the Warehouse
21
One way of doing this is by using the Square Root Rule which was first  
introduced by David Maister in 1976. Maister’s rule enables companies to quickly 
calculate the reduction or increase in safety stock required when the number  
of warehouses is changed.
It states that the total safety stock in a supply chain is proportional to the 
square root of the number of locations at which a product is stored. The calcu-
lation is as follows:
Reduction in stockholding (%) = [1 − (√x ÷ √y)] × 100 
Where ‘y’ is the original number of warehouses and ‘x’ is the proposed number 
of warehouses.
This calculation cannot be used in isolation. Other factors, such as supplier 
and customer lead times, the product itself (different types of electrical plug  
for example), transport costs and distribution centre costs also have to be taken 
into account.
The rule is based on the assumption that the amount of safety stock in each 
existing warehouse in the system is approximately the same.
Supply chain trends affecting warehouses
This section examines current trends within today’s supply chain and how 
these are likely to affect warehouse operations.
The e-commerce phenomenon will continue to grow both for business-to-
business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors. From a convenience 
point of view and under greater environmental pressure, grocery home shop-
ping and delivery will also grow significantly.
This will necessitate more fulfilment centres and returns processing facilities.
Retailers and manufacturers will continue to look for further cost savings as 
markets become even more competitive. Warehouses will be expected to be 
more efficient and cost-effective, with the likely closure of inflexible buildings 
and inefficient operations.
Retailers will continue to take stock out of the supply chain, leading to increases 
in stockless depots, transhipment and consolidation centres and cross-dock 
operations.
The cost of transport and stock-reduction targets could potentially bring 
manufacturing closer to the consumer. Eastern Europe has recently become a 
centre for manufacturing within automotive and electronics and near-shoring 
is becoming a distinct possibility with US and European companies bringing 
some production back to their shores.

Warehouse Management
22
The increase in port-centric logistics has resulted in companies building 
large warehouses as close to the ports of entry as possible. As mentioned, 
Tesco’s 1.2 million square foot warehouse at Teesport UK is a typical example.
The miniaturization of products such as mobile phones, DVD players and 
computers, together with the increasing use of electronic media for listening  
to music and reading books via downloads, is likely to result in less space 
required for these types of products.
The sustainability agenda will also play its part within the supply chain. This 
will result in the development of further brown field sites, linkages to rail and 
potentially canal and river networks, and self-sufficiency in terms of energy use.
Future warehouses will be expected to be carbon positive which will be 
backed up by legislation in the future. UK retailer John Lewis built a new dis-
tribution centre in the UK with a view to significantly reducing its carbon 
footprint. Early results showed savings of 18 per cent in energy costs, 45 per 
cent in water usage, an overall reduction of 40 per cent in CO2 emissions and 
a cost saving of circa £250,000 per annum.
It is expected that new warehouses will be targeted with having their own 
means of power generation, be it solar or wind, and may also convert waste 
into power. See page 360 on the environment for further information.
Greater collaboration within the supply chain both vertically and horizon-
tally will lead to greater consolidation and an increase in shared-user operations. 
This is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of warehouses and the con-
struction of purpose-built centres.
The ability for companies to work closely with each other and trust each 
other will be a major factor as to how quickly this collaboration takes place.
The growth of e-fulfilment and its effect  
on the warehouse
According to Forrester (2013) online retail sales in the United States in 2013 
will reach $262 billion – a rise of 13 per cent over 2012’s $231 billion represent-
ing 8 per cent of the total retail market and will reach $370 billion by 2017. 
In the United Kingdom online retail sales accounts for approximately 10 per 
cent of overall sales and is likely to grow between 10 and 15 per cent over the 
next few years. The growth in countries such as China is closer to 75 per cent.
Internet retailing is still in its infancy and there are no signs of this rapid 
growth slowing. According to Goldman Sachs, the global e-commerce market 
could be worth around $1 trillion by the end of 2013.
With regard to warehousing, pure internet traders have had an advantage  
in developing purpose-built facilities according to a recent TI report for Savills 
(2013) whereas existing retailers and manufacturers who are selling online 

The Role of the Warehouse
23
need to adapt existing logistics systems and facilities to meet these new demands 
or create new ones to accommodate the move to multichannel retailing.
The report suggests that the tipping point for dedicated e-commerce fulfil-
ment centres is approximately 200,000 orders and that warehouses are in the 
region of 20–60,000 square feet.
There are significant challenges for warehouse managers when operating  
an e-fulfilment warehouse.
These warehouses are significantly impacted by seasonality. The demand on 
staff and equipment varies tremendously with the seasons: large, bulky items 
such as barbecues and garden furniture during spring and summer and much 
smaller electrical products during the run-up to Christmas. These have very 
different impacts on handling and storage equipment.
Second, the wide range of products stored requires warehouse managers  
to efficiently process low-value, single-item orders. This is one of the main chal-
lenges facing all warehouses today but in particular those dealing with internet 
orders. Picking and packing low-cost items utilize the same amount of labour 
and equipment as for high-cost items but the margin is going to be significantly 
different.
Third, as consumers flex their muscles in the market, accuracy and on-time 
delivery become paramount if companies are to retain the loyalty of their 
customers.
Inventory management is another challenge for the warehouse manager.  
The increase in the number of product lines will put pressure on the number  
of pick locations whilst slow-moving and obsolete lines can take up much-
needed space in the warehouse. From a picking point of view the proliferation 
of product lines will result in warehouse managers having to look at alterna-
tives to ground-floor pick locations such as mezzanine floors, flow racking and 
carousels.
In order to release vital space to the warehouse operation, stock turnover 
has to be managed well and decisions made quickly regarding the disposal of 
non-moving stock.
As discussed earlier, one of the main by-products of e-commerce is a large 
percentage of returns. This can be between 30 and 40 per cent of outward 
volume. Significantly, many of the returns are good stock which can be resold 
but have to go through a thorough quality check.
Mark Hewitt, ex-chief executive of iForce in the United Kingdom, sees this 
developing interest in returns:
There will be a growing demand for outsourcing e-fulfilment to companies that 
can also offer returns processing from the same facility, as this will drive down costs 
by enabling a more efficient process for putting returned goods straight back into 
stock.
(Supply Chain Standard)

Warehouse Management
24
A number of the third-party providers are now assisting their clients with the 
disposal of the returned goods through having their own eBay stores.
Next-day delivery is seen as the norm, which puts further pressure on the ware­
house manager to balance speed with accuracy. Allied to this is the requirement 
to be able to integrate systems with couriers and customer services to be able to 
track and trace the progress of each order.
According to Savills (2013) there is no current ‘blue-print’ for the optimum e-
fulfilment centre design. Different retailers adopt very different strategies.
Companies such as Amazon have developed unique systems that are capable 
of handling extremely large volumes of different types of products (ranging from 
relatively small in size to larger goods).
Smaller businesses will carry out fulfilment in their retail premises until the 
volume makes this unmanageable. Many small logistics providers and mail fulfil­
ment firms now offer e-fulfilment, typically in general warehouse premises used 
for other aspects of the business.
A number of multichannel operators have developed dedicated e-fulfilment 
centres, once online sales volumes have become large enough.
Others have adopted a strategy of keeping e-retail volumes and traditional 
store volumes together, either as an opportunity to utilize spare capacity or due 
to minimal advantage in separating channels.
To summarize, there are three types of fulfilment centre:
●
●integrated fulfilment, where internet sales are carried out alongside 
existing retail operations;
●
●dedicated fulfilment, carried out in a purpose-built facility; and
●
●store fulfilment, which involves picking online orders from existing 
retail shelves for separate delivery ex store. A same-day courier service 
provided by Shutl boasts a record delivery time of 13 minutes 57 seconds 
for an online order using this channel!
The third option has been favoured in the past for launching the service and 
establishment of e-fulfillment but is least favoured for a substantive operation.
In this section we briefly discuss three specialist types of warehousing, customs 
warehousing, refrigerated storage and fashion logistics.
Specialized warehousing
Customs warehousing by Mike Hodge and Gwynne 
Richards
This section is written specifically for the United Kingdom. However, most 
countries will have some form of customs warehousing.

The Role of the Warehouse
25
The operation of running a customs warehouse can bring huge benefits to 
an international trade business by delaying the payment of import duty and 
VAT and avoiding the payment of these taxes altogether if the imported 
merchandise is exported outside the EU. This is particularly useful if the com-
pany is unsure of the ultimate destination of the product. This section deals 
only with customs warehousing, which is a regime for the importation and 
storage of products imported from outside the EU which are liable to customs 
duty, VAT, anti-dumping duty, etc. It does not deal with excise duty products – 
beer, wines, spirits, tobacco, which are covered by other specific regulations.
In the customs ‘area’, there are basically two types of warehouse. There is a 
Type A warehouse which is operated by a warehouse keeper who has goods 
belonging to a number of companies in the warehouse. All customs responsi-
bilities lie with the warehouse keeper. There is also a Type C approval which is 
granted for one importer to store his own goods in his own warehouse. No 
special security measures (eg barred windows, separate areas, etc) are required. 
There is also a Type E approval whereby a number of warehouse sites are 
included in the same authorization.
As an example of a Type C operation, consider a business importing forklift 
trucks that are manufactured in China. The rate of import duty at importation 
would be 4.5 per cent of the landed cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value.  
If the annual import value is £20 million, the duty cost will be £900,000 and 
the VAT impact, £4.18 million – a not inconsiderable sum. By obtaining an ap-
proval to operate a customs warehouse (on the importer’s own site), the duty 
and VAT payments are delayed until such time as the forklift trucks are sold 
into the UK market. At that stage an import declaration is made and the duty 
and VAT is paid. By using the duty and VAT deferment scheme, a further six 
weeks of cash flow benefit can be obtained. If the trucks are sold into the EU, 
only the customs duty is payable as long as the EU customer can provide an EU 
VAT registration number. If the forklift trucks are exported outside the EU, no 
duty or VAT is payable. The cash flow savings and duty saving opportunities are 
obvious and significant.
It is true to say, however, that obtaining approval to operate a customs  
warehouse is not without its difficulties. The EU is in the process of re-writing 
the legislation (known as the Union Customs Code), which covers all customs 
matters. In 2016 or so, when the new legislation takes effect, it is highly likely 
that a customs warehouse operator will require a financial guarantee to cover 
the potential duty and VAT on all products stored in the warehouse. There  
is a way to avoid this requirement and that is for the applicant to obtain a 
different (safety and security) approval called authorized economic operator 
(AEO). An AEO is an economic operator who, by satisfying certain criteria,  
is considered to be reliable in their customs related operations throughout the 
European Community. The introduction of AEO status is the EC’s response to 

Warehouse Management
26
the need to secure international supply chains and the introduction of Customs-
Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) in the United States and the 
development of the Safe framework of standards in the World Customs 
Organization.
The aim is to provide businesses with an internationally recognized quality 
mark which will indicate that their role in the international supply chain is 
secure and their customs controls and procedures are efficient and compliant. 
An operator with AEO security and safety status implies that apart from being 
reliable in the traditional financial and customs terms, they are also compliant 
in respect of security and safety standards and can therefore be considered as  
a ‘secure’ trader and thus a reliable trading partner.
Effectively, to obtain approval to operate a customs warehouse, the appli-
cant has to reach the AEO standards so that achievement automatically grants 
a waiver from the need for a financial guarantee.
The customs warehouse operator will have to invest in a duty management 
system which interfaces directly with the HMRC’s computer system known as 
CHIEF (Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight).
Customs warehousing can bring substantial benefits both in controlling 
the flow of merchandise and savings in tax. A first step is to look at the business 
case where the costs and benefits can be established. The use of a customs expert 
in this area is strongly advised.
Refrigerated warehouses (by Chris Sturman)
The growth in the refrigeration market, due to demand for food that can retain 
its freshness as opposed to produce with a shelf life, has placed increasing pressure 
on cold-store operators.
The key function of a refrigerated warehouse is to maintain the temperature 
of products at the level at which they were received. Blast freezing and temper-
ing chambers are used for managing any change of temperature required and 
these activities should take place away from the main storage areas to mini-
mize the risk of temperature deviation (+/–) to goods being held in stock. Cold 
chain management and maintenance of food quality and safety whilst manag-
ing significant energy and materials handling cost levels are priorities.
At the same time, boards of directors and management need to assess the risks 
which relate to fire and business continuity, these being major issues facing 
both the food processing and storage and distribution industries in the United 
Kingdom. A business continuity and disaster recovery plan should be a core 
requirement of the business regime, with staff involvement and training being 
prerequisites.

The Role of the Warehouse
27
Materials handling and storage in a temperature-
controlled environment
A wide range of storage media is used, all with the intention of optimizing 
storage capacity with accessibility, given the high fixed and variable costs pre­
valent in the sector. The most popular are:
●
●Wide, narrow and very narrow aisle racking. Used in faster-moving 
operations, particularly in order picking by case and by unit. These suit 
secondary distribution layouts, where access to a wide range of stock-
keeping units (SKUs) is required, and delivery lead times are short. Often 
reserve stock is held in a national or primary distribution centre (NDC 
or PDC).
●
●Drive-in racking. Used for bulk pallet storage and more frequently for 
longer-term storage, to suit seasonal production and supply peaks or 
production/packaging operations to meet different packing formats.
●
●Mobile racking. Buildings must first be constructed with mobility in 
mind, as the building needs substantial steel runners set flush into the 
insulated cold-store floor surface. Popular with smaller companies that 
have higher volumes to store but also need accessibility for range and 
stock rotation.
●
●Automated storage. More common in continental Europe, although 
recent developments on behalf of multinational food processors in the 
United Kingdom have seen two further high bay stores built and 
commissioned for primary/national pallet storage and distribution. 
These are very economical for customers if volume related, and best 
attached or contracted to a high-volume production plant. However, 
they are totally dependent on design and WMS software for operational 
capability and capacity/speed, and these demand high standards of 
presentation within the design pallet gauge. Reliability is key, with 
benefits in low manpower and energy costs.
The most recently constructed frozen food facilities are highly automated sites, 
with high-density storage areas. These types of storage media result in less air 
circulation and as a result reduced energy usage.

Case study 
Fredericks Dairies
Fredericks Dairies are the UK’s leading manufacturer of ice cream. Fredericks has a 
reputation of excellence, providing the highest quality products and services possible 
in the industry.
When business expansion necessitated they expand their warehousing facility, 
Fredericks looked to pallet racking industry leaders to create a solution that would be 
ecologically friendly, efficient, cost-effective and fit within strict building guidelines. 
Fredericks knew what they wanted; at least 13,000 pallet spaces in a building with 
imposed size limitations that could move 600 pallets within an eight-hour shift, all in 
a freezing –28  °C environment.
RediRack developed a revolutionary automated pallet storage, retrieval and 
sequencing solution using a pallet buffer and sequencing system. Using this 
technology, RediRack were able to increase the storage density by up to 90 per cent 
whilst reducing annual running costs by a similar amount. In new build situations, the 
same storage capacity can be provided with a 45 per cent reduction in the building 
footprint giving substantial savings in construction costs.
This solution produced a storage capacity of 13,500 pallets. Terry Haigh, Operations 
Director, said: ‘Traditional solutions such as VNA, crane systems and mobile racking 
just couldn’t achieve what Fredericks needed.’
www.reditechnix.com/solutions/RediLogX/
The UK’s largest frozen food logistics facility to date was opened in Wisbech, 
Cambridgeshire in 2010. The store, operated by Partner Logistics, has space 
for 77,000 pallets, operates at temperatures of –27 degrees centigrade, and 
measures 175 metres by 88 metres by 36 metres high.
The density of storage is achieved by drive-in racking. This uses the cube  
of the building efficiently and is important in terms of economies for energy 
usage.
All these cold stores require specific types of MHE equipment, which have  
to be specially adapted by the manufacturer to be able to operate efficiently  
in chilled and sub-zero environments. Key aspects include:
●
●heavy-duty batteries designed for a minimum eight-hour shift life;
●
●special hydraulic oils to withstand sub-zero temperature levels; and

environment
●
●electronic and electrical systems encased or coated to prevent moisture 
ingress.
In some cases, trucks are fitted with heated cabs to avoid driving staff having 
to wear special temperature-controlled clothing. This enables them to work 
longer since they no longer need the in-shift warming breaks (see Figure 1.6, 
courtesy of Bendi).
Energy management and plant maintenance
Energy is a large proportion of operating costs, ranging from 12 to 30 per cent 
on average. The actual amount will depend first on the age and condition of  
the building, relative thermographic integrity and the age and management of 
refrigeration plant, and second on equipment management and maintenance.
Buildings flex naturally, but cold stores more so, because of the temperature 
and humidity range between the inside and outside environments. The most 

Warehouse Management
30
important area of focus is the avoidance of heat ingress into the cold space 
through panel joints, door frames and structures. An annual thermographic 
scan with immediate attention to panels and joints is essential. The second 
priority is to ensure that no condensation is allowed to settle on top of cold 
boxes which, depending on the time of year, can repeatedly freeze and melt,  
with potential ingress through surrounding joints into the panel structure, thereby 
allowing delamination and subsequent structural strength decay.
The shifting of energy loads to more suitable and cost-effective periods, 
thereby reducing the tariff rate or alternatively agreeing to be cut off at peak 
load periods, are methods of energy-cost reduction. An alternative and latest 
version of this is to be paid to agree to have supply curtailed for a fixed period 
on a timed basis.
The focus on energy and carbon reduction has resulted in significant research 
in techniques by which to generate even greater improvement. These include:
●
●a reduction in cooling demand by ensuring that product enters at the 
correct temperature;
●
●improved plant design;
●
●improved operational management and maintenance;
●
●recovery of heat to use elsewhere in the business – hot water, space 
heating, etc;
●
●examination of the use of CHP (combined heat and power) –  
tri-generation; and
●
●consideration of low carbon electricity – wind, wave or hydro-electric.
In addition, there are more radical approaches; with more positive and closer 
store management attention. These are as follows:
●
●carefully review the cold-store room layout and thereby change the 
temperature flows;
●
●raise refrigeration evaporating temperature for a potential 11 per cent 
or more cost saving;
●
●reduce refrigeration condensing temperature;
●
●seasonally adjust refrigeration to take account of external ambient 
temperature;
●
●where fitted, split cold-store and blast-freezer refrigeration systems;
●
●install and use variable-speed drive fans; and
●
●focus on and manage more closely door opening design and  
operations.

The Role of the Warehouse
31
Safety and risk assessment:
There are two different types of refrigerants used in temperature-controlled 
stores. These are either Hydro Chloro Carbon (HFC/HCFC) or ammonia based, 
with sometimes a brine or Freon secondary refrigerant, to minimize the ammonia 
charge.
HFC based refrigerants are currently being phased out, as a consequence of 
legislation following the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, to reduce Ozone 
Depleting Substances (ODS) or those with high Global Warming Potential (GWP).
The only economically realistic alternative is ammonia, a naturally available 
chemical. However, ammonia has dangerous and explosive attributes that 
require specific risk assessment and management (EU/UK ATEX/DSEAR Regu­
lations 2002 or equivalent in other countries).
Additionally, legionella risk assessment and management of condensers are 
required to ensure the safety of workers and occupiers of adjacent properties.
Stock management and housekeeping
In addition to the normal stock-management processes found in conventional 
warehouses, the following specific processes can be found in the temperature-
controlled sector:
●
●Traceability. EU 178/2002 sets out specific requirements for food safety, 
traceability and recall of unsafe foods. Warehouse operators should 
carefully consider whether they can be classed as food business 
operators (most public cold-store operators are) and register accordingly. 
Food Standards Agency Guidance Notes are available, which should be 
considered along with the Food Safety Act 1990 (Amendment) 
Regulations 2004 and the General Food Regulations 2004, along with 
requirements for marks and labels which differ depending on whether 
the product has been prepared for final consumption. Food Labelling 
Regulations 1996 (Regulation 35) also need to be considered.
Subsequently, EU Regulations 852 on the hygiene of foodstuffs and 
Regulation 853 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal 
origin require (inter alia) the maintenance of cold chain, implementation 
of procedures based on HACCP principles, consultation of good 
practice guides, and establishment of microbacterial and temperature-
controlled requirements based on scientific risk assessment, albeit that 
this requirement applies to storage and transport but not to retail 
establishments.
●
●Temperature checks. All stores need to be fitted with temperature-
monitoring equipment that is checked on a shift or am/pm basis and 
records kept for regulatory and operational analysis.

Warehouse Management
32
●
●Product checks. All products should be checked on intake to ensure that 
the product is sound and to specification. They should then be checked 
outbound to demonstrate to the collecting company and final receiver 
that they were at the specified temperature level on despatch. Care 
should be taken not to damage product at any time.
●
●Segregation. All damaged or unfit product should be labelled or marked 
and removed to ensure it cannot move further down the food chain.
●
●Date codes. Particularly with fast-moving chilled products, codes need 
particular attention to ensure correct rotation and 100 per cent 
acceptance at retail RDC or other final delivery point.
●
●Product spills. Need quick response, to avoid crushed product and 
packaging from spreading across the working space, and ingestion into 
the working parts of equipment.
Health and safety issues
Additional hazards are particularly harsh at zero degrees or below, but can still 
apply in certain cases to the chilled chain.
Specific issues surround the effect of cold temperature and the cold environ-
ment on people, and will also vary by type and size of facility and operations 
being undertaken.
Specific hazards:
●
●accidental lock-in risk, requiring alarms and quick-release equipment;
●
●the effect of cold on people and use of PPE require specific advice and 
training for staff to wear appropriate thermal clothing, drink lots of 
water, protect bare skin (particularly fingers, noses and ears), taking 
greater care if smokers or drinkers;
●
●accidental release of refrigerant, particularly ammonia;
●
●use of materials-handling equipment in slippery floor areas where ice 
build-up may occur, particularly around door openings. Slip and trip 
hazards are ever present along with the risk of skidding and overturning;
●
●ice build-up on panels present an ice-fall hazard, and can, if left, cause 
roof panels to fall, risking injury to operators below;
●
●product falls from pallet racks, due to displaced product;
●
●working at heights: the use of non-integrated platforms using forklift 
trucks has effectively been eliminated from all stores other than in 
sub-zero temperatures, and the use of mechanized elevating working 
platforms (MEWPs) is obligatory. However, these items of equipment 

The Role of the Warehouse
33
are not equipped for sub-zero temperatures. Here the practice is closely 
scrutinized as agreed between the industry and the Health and Safety 
Executive.
●
●The Food Storage and Distribution Federation, British Frozen Foods 
Federation and Health and Safety Executive have worked together to 
deliver a Supplementary Guidance (PM 28) during 2010 to help manage 
these risks.
Transportation issues
These revolve around the loading dock, where operational regimes need to 
ensure the maintenance of the cold chain, preventing temperature migration 
between the cold store, the outside temperature and the open vehicle whilst 
loading and unloading.
Solutions include the use of dock ports and shelters, with close-fitting seals 
around the door apertures of the vehicle, and air curtains to prevent the ingress 
of warm air.
Summary
Overall housekeeping regimes in any environment require the provision of a 
safe, clean, clear, unobstructed floor or work space to allow for the safe move-
ment of goods, vehicle equipment and people. The temperature-controlled 
environment requires that extra care is taken to address condensation and ice 
build-up on equipment, floors and walls, and that operational processes are 
designed with the care of people and product in mind.
Risk assessments and operational methods and instructions need to be 
developed with that as the first priority.
Fashion logistics
With large and fast-changing product ranges, as well as dramatic seasonal 
fluctuations, the fashion industry has demanding logistics requirements.
The need to balance distribution capacity between replenishing retail stores, 
fulfilling online orders and dealing efficiently with returns is making warehouse 
automation an increasingly attractive option for the fashion industry.
Fashion products are either boxed or travel as hanging garments. This mix 
of items requires different handling capabilities and ensuring that expensive 
items of clothing are not creased or crushed in transit through the supply 
chain provides supply chain and warehouse managers with some interesting 
challenges.

Companies are able to store coats and dresses on moveable rails within the 
warehouse; however, a more efficient and space effective method is to use some 
form of automation.
Product profile fashion logistics
With e-commerce presenting the challenge of large numbers of orders that each 
have a small quantity of items, KNAPP has developed a new concept that looks 
to bridge the gap between hanging and boxed product. Pick-it-Easy Pocket is  
a solution that allows flat-packed goods and hanging garments to be processed 
together, for the first time, on the same system. The system consists of hanging 
pockets – suitable for flat-packed clothes, shoes, accessories, books, DVDs or 
toys – that are conveyed to a matrix sorter so that they arrive at the packing 
stations in the correct sequence to collate each customer’s order. The pockets 
can be fitted with RFID tags and the solution can process up to 10,000 items 
an hour.
The utilization of a hanging garment sorter means that the cube of the build-
ing can be fully utilized with rails travelling above the work and storage areas.
Summary and conclusion
There are many types of warehouses operating within very different supply 
chains. No longer are they simply stockholding points.
The transfer of supply chain control from manufacturers to retailers in 
the 1980s and 1990s has seen a significant change in the operation of storage 

The Role of the Warehouse
35
facilities worldwide. Warehouses are, in the main, no longer seen as static 
storage units. Concepts such as consolidation, cross docking and postpone-
ment have become commonplace with the ultimate goal of stock reduction and 
increased throughput within the whole supply chain.
Retailers are continually looking to move stock back through the supply 
chain thus releasing more sales space in store. This requires more control over 
the supply chain, improved forecasting and accurate and timely information 
flow.
The advent of e-commerce has also changed the warehouse landscape ap-
preciably, as has the necessity for cost reduction and the growing pressure to 
reduce the impact of logistics operations on the environment.
Companies are continually striving to reduce inventory within the supply 
chain and the continuing use of offshore manufacturing, increasing consumer 
choice and a predilection for instant gratification ensure that stockholding  
remains a necessity even in these days of just-in-time, efficient consumer re-
sponse and quick response.
Warehouses remain a crucial link within today’s supply chains. As a result, 
warehouse managers and their colleagues need to be better equipped to man-
age a constantly changing environment and also need to work closely with 
their counterparts in their wider supply chains.

“
Role of the 
warehouse 
manager
Managers today have to do more with less, and get better 
results from limited resources, more than ever before... A 
manager’s job is to provide the environment where individuals 
are internally motivated to do the very best job possible, in the 
very best spirit possible, to make the very best contribution 
possible.
(Brian Tracy)
Introduction
Today’s warehouse managers no longer patrol the warehouse in brown 
coats clutching a clipboard and pencil. They are more likely to be in a suit or 
corporate uniform, use a personal digital assistant (PDA) and more often than 
not are seen hunched over a laptop deciphering the latest cost and productivity 
figures.
This chapter examines the challenges facing today’s warehouse manager and 
the attributes required to deal with them. Each challenge is introduced to the 
reader and is further examined in detail in the remaining sections of the book.
One of the main challenges for the warehouse manager before we begin to 
look at the warehouse itself is whether they and their colleagues see themselves 
as the right person for the job.
Nick Weetman, commenting in Retail Week (2009), said:
It is a neglected area. The effort expended on developing warehouse management is 
not proportionate to the importance of the warehouse as a business... We see a lot 
of warehouse management where people have just been promoted and don’t really 
understand how to run warehouses. Those (retailers) that do have it in-house need 
to understand it’s a critical part, and retail is just the end of the supply chain.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
37
A recent job description for a distribution centre manager required the fol-
lowing key skills and outlined core accountabilities which are typically sought 
from today’s senior warehouse managers: these included an ability to negotiate, 
information technology skills, basic finance and business acumen, people manage-
ment skills and an ability to motivate and lead large numbers of employees 
through communication and engagement.
These are very much people skills and as Lee Iacocca (1984) said, ‘Management 
is nothing more than motivating other people.’
The job description and the core accountabilities were as follows:
●
●the provision of a responsive and cost-efficient warehouse that is aligned 
with the current and long-term requirements of the global business strategy;
●
●responsibility for the leadership and direction of the warehouse team;
●
●to ensure that the warehouse is capable of delivering the volume 
requirements of the business;
●
●to drive continuous improvement in the cost-efficiency of the 
operations;
●
●to set the long-term vision for the warehouse in line with the strategic 
plan and to ensure that future volumes and customer service 
requirements can be met;
●
●to safeguard the human and physical assets employed in the warehouse;
●
●the management of projects and introduction of new initiatives;
●
●to maintain strong relationships with suppliers; and
●
●the development and management of industrial relations within the 
warehouse environment.
The people aspect is very important and a job description for a distribution 
centre manager produced by WERC suggested that the manager needs an  
ability to:
●
●develop and maintain a productive work team by creating programmes 
for hiring, training and professional development;
●
●match the skill and background of personnel to the work required;
●
●apply sound communication and motivational techniques, create 
programmes to supervise, counsel and discipline associates; and
●
●implement an appropriate performance evaluation system for 
recommending promotions, wage increases and terminations.
The warehouse manager has a number of operational challenges and is also 
expected to understand and implement company strategy in relation to ware-
house activity.

Warehouse Management
38
Again we see the trade-offs that the warehouse manager has to deal with. 
These include cost versus responsiveness, and cost-efficiency versus volume 
throughput.
It is good to see that safeguarding human assets is included in the list of core 
accountabilities as this is a common worry for warehouse managers.
Today’s manager has to maximize the effective use of his/her operational 
resources whilst satisfying customer requirements. This can be done effectively 
through motivating and managing staff effectively. People are a warehouse’s 
most valuable assets and should be used appropriately.
The above job description is reasonably typical of the requirements of a 
warehouse manager in today’s fast-moving economic environment. The expect­
ation is that the manager will achieve high customer service levels but also 
reduce cost through improved productivity and performance. Added to this is 
the constraint of lower inventory, reduced customer lead time and the pressure 
to ensure the safety and security of staff, equipment and stock.
The six basic tenets of warehouse management can be summed up as follows:
●
●accuracy;
●
●cost control;
●
●cleanliness;
●
●efficiency;
●
●safety; and
●
●security.
Warehouse trade-offs
Managing trade-offs within the warehouse is fundamental to the role of ware-
house manager.
The main trade-offs are shown in Figure 2.1.
Warehouse managers are also expected to recognize and balance other 
trade-offs within the warehouse, examples of which are as follows:
●
●increased throughput versus reduction in labour costs;
●
●storage density versus quicker pallet extraction;
●
●manual versus automated processes;
●
●increased pick rates versus accuracy;
●
●inventory holding costs versus cost of stock outs; and
●
●speed versus safety.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
39
Today’s challenges are many and varied and require additional skills from the 
warehouse manager.
The next section examines these specific challenges.
The warehouse manager’s challenges
Pressure on today’s warehouse manager comes from many different directions. 
These are both internal and external pressures.
A recent survey carried out by Intermec suggested the following:
●
●Nearly 3,000 hours per year are lost in warehouses and DCs through 
inefficient processes.
●
●80 per cent of managers have been tasked with finding cost savings in 
existing operations.
●
●On average managers have been tasked with finding nearly 20 per cent 
cost savings across their organizations.
●
●The majority of managers suggested the following areas were most 
inefficient:
–– inventory control (53 per cent);
–– picking (47 per cent);
–– putaway and replenishment (45 per cent).
One surprising fact that came out of the survey was that one in six managers 
will not review their workflow processes until they receive a customer complaint 
(Intermec 2012).
The main pressures and challenges are as follows:

Pressure to reduce operating costs
Companies are targeting the supply chain as an area where costs can be re-
duced further and as a result pressure is increasing on transport and warehouse 
managers to reduce costs whilst also increasing customer service.
This has resulted in companies evaluating outsourcing options as well as 
reviewing their own logistics operations.
Achieving the perfect order
A recent key performance indicator (KPI) introduced into the supply chain 
is the perfect order metric. A perfect order is deemed to be one that has been 
delivered on time, in full, in perfect condition and accompanied with the 
correct paperwork. This metric includes many of the current supply chain per-
formance measures, and providing everybody uses the same parameters it can 
be adopted as one of the leading supply chain measures and a differentiator 
between companies and supply chains. If we ever get to a paperless transaction 
we may need to replace the fourth metric.
Shorter order lead times and stock availability
Order lead time is the length of time between the placing of an order and the 
receipt of the item by the customer. Order lead time can be a significant dif-
ferentiator between competitors. For example, if your favourite cereal is not on 
the shelf of the supermarket, you are unlikely to wait for the next delivery but 
will look for it in another store or choose the closest alternative, whether from 
the same brand or a different brand. Online consumers are likely to choose the 
quickest delivery method providing the quality and costs are alike.
The quality of products is such that competitive advantage is gained 
through fast, timely and accurate delivery. With the internet providing price 
transparency through a proliferation of price comparison websites, com-
petitive advantage is now gained through offering the best service by whatever 
channel the consumer decides.
The most effective warehouses are those that have reduced lead times whilst 
maintaining quality at a reduced cost.
Delivery through multiple channels
Companies are increasingly delivering via multiple channels to reach custom-
ers more effectively. The pressure on the warehouse is brought about through 
having to present goods in a variety of different ways.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
41
These include direct delivery of single items to the end user, multiple SKU 
orders direct to store and bulk orders to retail distribution centres. Each has its 
own different pick requirement and is likely to rely on different equipment. 
Order lead times will also vary, as will the method of delivery.
Steve Smith of Manhattan Associates (Supply Chain Standard) summed this 
up when he said: ‘Moving from a comparatively uncomplicated process of 
supplying and replenishing high street stores – with some added complexity 
around special promotions – to an online presence with fulfilment from either 
a store or a warehouse, be that dedicated or part of an existing facility, creates 
complexities associated with “singles” picking, small order volume, the number 
of deliveries, time limits, availability issues, and so on.’
Smaller, more frequent orders
Manufacturers and retailers are continually striving to reduce inventory whilst 
retail stores are looking to increase floor sales space and thus reduce the amount 
of inventory held in stock rooms. Just-in-time methods, increasing internet sales 
and initiatives such as efficient consumer response (ECR) and quick response 
(QR) are resulting in smaller, more frequent orders. This again necessitates 
changes in warehouse operations, with a move away from full-pallet picking to 
carton and individual-item picks.
Greater fluctuations in demand
The days of predictable sales are long gone, with consumers rather than manu-
facturers flexing their muscles in the marketplace. Seasonality remains a factor 
in terms of market sectors such as fashion, while pre- and post-Christmas sales 
are now stretching warehouse resources to the limit as the rush to get product 
to stores intensifies.
Companies have to be able to ramp up resources during the peak periods 
and have a much leaner operation during slower, quieter periods.
The clothing manufacturer shown in Figure 1.3 on page 15 operates with 
a core team of seven warehouse staff, which can increase to over 40 during 
busy periods.
Increases in stock-keeping units
The proliferation of product lines gives the consumer choice; however, it is 
a major challenge for warehouse managers in terms of having sufficient, 
cost-effective pick locations. Once operators have to pick items at height, 
productivity rates reduce significantly.

Warehouse Management
42
Retailers continue to seek differentiation and as a result are continually 
looking to introduce product variants, not only in terms of the product itself 
but also in pack size, the type of packaging, labelling and product combinations. 
Retailers are also introducing more of their own-brand labels to provide con-
sumers with even greater choice.
This has led to a number of companies introducing postponement into the 
warehouse. This entails holding stock of the basic product and only adding the 
‘extras’ once orders have been received. Examples include loading specific soft-
ware onto personal computers, adding additional memory or including extras 
such as monitors and keyboards – known as bundling.
Labour cost and availability
During periods of high employment many countries are seeing labour rates 
steadily increasing and coupled with the fact that a number of countries have 
an ageing population it is becoming harder to source experienced warehouse 
operatives. Additionally, working in a warehouse is not seen as being the most 
glamorous of occupations and this deters a number of young people from 
entering the industry.
Warehouse managers need to come up with ways to attract new staff.
Many workforces have been supplemented with the introduction of staff from 
abroad. In these circumstances companies need to look at employing bilingual 
supervisors and contemplate the use of new technology such as voice-directed 
processes. There is also the added challenge of health and safety, ensuring that 
foreign staff are able to read and understand instructions.
Another way to attract staff is to be flexible on working hours. This can 
include shifts that coincide with school hours or with spouses’ work hours, 
such as twilight shifts. The length of shift can also be varied to coincide with 
worker preferences. This can also attract student workers. Although potentially 
difficult to organize, this can prove beneficial in the long run.
Parkinson’s Law suggests that work expands to fill the time allowed. This 
can be a problem in many warehouses when volumes are low. The introduction 
of annualized hours or even zero hour contracts allow companies to match 
resource to demand as and when required.
Environmental issues
Warehouse managers are not only tasked with cost savings but also the reduc-
tion of the warehouse’s impact on the environment.
This includes areas such as energy consumption, affecting areas such as 
lighting, mechanical handling equipment (MHE), cooling and heating.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
43
Managers need to set examples by switching off lights and heaters when 
they are not in use and ensuring that MHE is operating optimally.
The issue of waste is also high on the environmental agenda. The warehouse 
can generate a great deal of waste in its daily operation. This includes stretch-
wrap, cardboard, tape, pallets, etc. These need to be closely controlled and, 
where cost effective, recycled, reused or turned into energy.
Data and information transfer
One of the warehouse manager’s greatest challenges is how to manage data. 
Today’s supply chain produces vast amounts of data and it is up to the ware-
house manager among others to analyse this data and use it effectively.
A further challenge is ensuring that data is transferred to the correct location. 
It has been said that supply chains are all about the transfer of information and 
products are a secondary thought. The ability to track items throughout the 
supply chain is paramount, especially in the food and pharmaceutical market 
sectors.
As can be seen from this list and Figure 2.2, the role of warehouse manager 
has expanded significantly over the years and, as a result, the warehouse man-
ager has become an important link within the supply chain.
Lean warehousing
One way of overcoming some of the above challenges is the introduction of 
‘lean’ concepts into the warehouse operation.
The concept of ‘lean’ comes from the manufacturing sector, more specifically 
the automotive industry, and is very much associated with Toyota and the 
Toyota Way.
‘Lean’ is now being applied not only in manufacturing but also within the 
public sector and the supply chain. The idea behind lean is to remove any activity 
that uses resources but doesn’t create any additional value.
In this short section we will look at how lean principles are likely to be 
applied within a warehouse operation.
According to Wild (2010), warehousing operations by definition are not 
lean. However, cross-dock centres and fulfilment centres can be, provided stock 
is moved quickly through the facility.
This is where lean techniques can be used within a warehouse environment. 
The idea is to identify the activities within the warehouse that absorb resources 
but don’t create additional value.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
45
Waste can be found in many areas of the warehouse, none more so than in 
the use of space. Many managers will say they are running out of space and 
require additional storage facilities, yet when you walk around the warehouse 
you may see obvious signs of waste. During a recent warehouse audit we were 
told that space was at a premium, yet there were many examples of wasted 
space. These included:
●
●half-height and quarter-height pallets taking up space in two-metre-high 
locations;
●
●part pallets of the same product spread over a number of different 
locations;
●
●over 10 per cent of the stock was obsolete.
In the first case there were opportunities to move the smaller pallets to other 
locations or alternatively invest in more rack beams to increase the number of 
available locations.
In the second, providing there weren’t issues with FIFO, batch numbers or 
best before dates, the pallets could have been consolidated. Although there is  
a labour cost involved it would have been more than compensated by the  
availability of more empty pallet locations.
In the third case, the warehouse was storing software products that had 
been superseded by new versions and were very unlikely to be sold. Decisions 
have to be made in conjunction with the finance department to dispose of  
obsolete product as soon as it is identified.
Other potential areas of waste in terms of both space and time are at the 
receiving and despatch bays. If companies are confident about the service re-
ceived from their suppliers and confident in the picking accuracy of their staff 
there should not be a requirement for product to be staged and checked before 
put away or despatch.
Gooley (2013) talks about the seven wastes or muda that lean management 
seeks to eliminate.
Examples in the warehouse include the following:
●
●transportation (driving an empty forklift);
●
●defects (time spent correcting errors such as misspicks);
●
●inventories (congestion at the inbound and outbound areas);
●
●motion (interrupting movement such as staging product before put-away);
●
●waiting time (bottlenecks at pick locations);
●
●overproduction (holding too much inventory); and
●
●overprocessing (performing unnecessary steps such as labelling  
and checking).

Warehouse Management
46
Other wastes include ignoring employee creativity and knowledge and over-
engineering a process.
Lean thinking revolves around having a clean and streamlined operation 
and removing non-value-adding processes. Waiting time is one of the biggest 
and most expensive wastes.
The 5S concept that underpins lean thinking can be easily applied to the 
warehouse as follows: The first S (Sort or Seiri or Clear out) concentrates on 
removing any unnecessary items from the work area. This can include obso-
lete and damaged stock, over stocks, defective equipment, broken pallets, 
waste packaging, etc. It can also refer to unnecessary movement within the 
warehouse. For example, the introduction of a cross aisle within the picking 
area will reduce the amount of travel undertaken by the operators.
You can also look to replace manual paper picking systems with radio 
frequency technology such as scanning, voice or pick to light.
Items marked for disposal can be put into a holding area until a consensus 
is reached as to what should be done with them.
The second S (Straighten or Seiton or Configure) focuses on efficient and 
effective placement of items, eg location labelling and putting frequently used 
items in easy to access locations. Directional signs in the warehouse are also 
part of this as it should reduce the amount of time taken to find items.
Items such as empty pallets and packaging should be placed in easily acces-
sible areas close to the point of need.
Finally parking areas for handling equipment need to be set up with re-
minders to staff to put the equipment on charge if required.
The third S (Shine or Seiso or Clean) comes after you have cleared the area of 
any unnecessary items. Thoroughly clean the area and produce a timetable for 
cleaning. This can be done at the end of each shift with defects to equipment 
reported immediately.
Staff take pride in a clean work area; they work better and from experience 
clean warehouses tend to be more efficient!
Suggestions include putting bins at the front of each aisle to capture waste 
paper, packaging and broken pallets and making brooms and dust pans easily 
accessible.
The fourth S (Standardize or Seiketsu or Conform) is all about creating 
standards for each work area. Walk through each process with the relevant 
staff and then produce, document and display best practice procedures within 
the warehouse.
Make them simple to read and understand. A photograph displaying the 
process with minimal text works well in this situation.
The fifth S (Sustain or Shitsuke or Custom) ensures continuous improvement. 
Staff are encouraged not to return to previous work practices but to accept 
change and take things to a new level.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
47
Regular checks and audits need to be carried out with the potential for 
bonus payments on achieving high performance scores.
More recently companies have introduced a sixth S which covers safety. It 
can be argued that safety is at the heart of the operation and therefore is a 
valuable addition to the 5S mentality.
5S needs to be carried out in the correct order. You need to give individuals 
responsibility for each task and for their respective work areas within the 
warehouse.
People management
During the past few years as I’ve been running warehouse management courses, 
one of the main topics of discussion has been how to attract, manage and 
motivate staff.
This section concentrates on what we believe to be the lynchpin of the 
warehouse operation: the people. Technological advancements have brought 
increased productivity and higher accuracy into the warehouse operation; 
however, warehouse managers still rely heavily on their staff to ensure a cost-
effective and efficient operation.
In all industries, companies face identical workforce management challenges. 
These include:
●
●identifying, attracting and retaining good supervisors, first line 
managers and team leaders;
●
●retaining and attracting new employees;
●
●an ageing and constantly changing workforce, including the 
introduction of foreign staff;
●
●identifying training needs;
●
●the need to provide safe, comfortable working conditions;
●
●employment contract negotiations;
●
●compliance with employment and health and safety legislation; and
●
●staff discipline.
People challenges
Warehouse supervisors are seen as the cornerstone of warehouse operations. 
They can be in charge of large numbers of staff within a warehouse depending 

Warehouse Management
48
on the type of work carried out, the size of the warehouse and the capabilities 
of the supervisors and their staff.
In our experience, a ratio of one supervisor to 12–15 staff members is the 
optimum. Any higher and supervision becomes less effective, whilst any lower 
and costs increase and there is more onus on the supervisor to assist in the 
tasks. This is not always a bad thing as it provides the supervisor with a greater 
insight into the job at hand and facilitates progression. However, it can reduce 
overall effectiveness.
A survey carried out by Cranfield University (Baker and Perotti 2008) 
showed the average number of operators per supervisor were as follows:
●
●small warehouse (<  10,000 square metres): 1 supervisor 
per 8 operators; and
●
●large warehouse (>  10,000 square metres): 1 supervisor 
per 15 operators.
As discussed previously, the role of the warehouse and that of its staff has 
changed appreciably over the last 10 years. Warehouse staff roles are changing 
to include more tasks that were once undertaken by staff in administration, 
inventory control and customer service.
McMahon et al (2007) undertook research into the various logistics func-
tions and found that warehouse supervisors work in the difficult middle. They 
must understand and often do the work of operators and clerical staff but 
also perform management tasks. These jobs are complex, calling for frequent 
decisions and almost constant activity.
In today’s warehouse, supervisors need a comprehensive knowledge of the 
operation along with significant management skills.
These changes have altered the way companies hire, train and develop ware-
house supervisors. They require higher education standards, better training 
and ongoing personal development.
Supervisors are the people at the sharp end as the warehouse managers are 
usually found at their desks in front of computer screens evaluating reports 
and planning future activity.
Warehouse supervisors therefore need high-level supervisory, training and 
interpersonal skills. They also need to know about supplier and customer 
procedures that affect warehouse operations.
Supervisors also need to manage by example. A previous director of mine 
was often seen picking up litter within the warehouse, setting an example to 
the rest of the staff. This simple task shows how important housekeeping is 
within a modern warehouse. Having been around warehouses all my working 
life, I have yet to find an untidy warehouse that is likely to figure within the top 
10 best-performing warehouses in the country.

Role of the Warehouse Manager
49
Taking pride in the way the warehouse looks tends to mean that staff take  
a pride in their work, leading to an efficient warehouse.
According to Ackerman (2000), effective supervisors and managers encour-
age an open exchange of ideas and have frequent discussions with their staff 
and peers. They should have nine critical attributes:
1	 Excellent communication skills
The ability to receive and convey messages clearly and explicitly. 
Miscommunication leads to confusion, wasted effort and a missed 
opportunity.
2	 An ability to delegate effectively
This is a hard skill to master but very effective when achieved. Once a 
task is delegated, managers and supervisors must not oversee the task 
too closely but neither should they abrogate responsibility. They need to 
monitor how the task is progressing and give feedback on performance.
3	 Motivational skills
Supervisors and managers need to understand their staff and adapt their 
approach to motivation and feedback according to each person’s needs. 
Providing staff with consistent feedback, even when they are performing 
well, is as important as the feedback to less well-performing staff.
According to Gavin Chappell, supply chain director at Asda Walmart 
in the United Kingdom, ‘if you get the culture right and the atmosphere, 
structure and progression right it’s not that difficult to get a motivated 
team’ (Retail Week 2009).
4	 Problem-solving skills
Problem-solving and decision-making skills are closely aligned and each 
requires a person to identify and develop options, and having done so, 
act decisively.
One example provided by Gagnon (1988) is that ‘hidden lost time 
accounts for about 80 per cent of lost time, yet attracts only about  
20 per cent of management’s problem-solving attention’.
He said that ‘it’s easy to see operators standing around because they 
have no work to do; much harder is to see delays in operations that are 
the result of system issues, poor data, bad processes, etc – but that time 
can really add up’. Supervisors should be alert to these situations.
When walking around your warehouse, look for staff who are 
waiting for something to happen before they can do their own job – 
find out what’s causing the bottleneck and change the process.
According to Goldratt (1984) every operation has some kind of 
constraint that stops it from operating optimally – the weakest link in 
the chain. You need to identify the constraint and change the way you 
work to overcome it.

Warehouse Management
50
The five steps in the process are as follows:
●
●identify the constraint;
●
●exploit the constraint (get the most that you can out of the current 
situation);
●
●subordinate everything to the constraint (avoid producing more than 
the constraint can handle);
●
●elevate the constraint (focus on eliminating it); and
●
●identify the next constraint.
Congestion at a pick face can be an example of a bottleneck:
●
●identified by people waiting in turn to pick items;
●
●try to maximize productivity under the current situation;
●
●don’t overload the system by sending too many pickers to the same 
location;
●
●increase the number of pick locations for that product.
If cured, return to step 1.
5	 Flexibility
Supervisors in today’s fast-moving warehouse environment need to be 
flexible, react quickly to urgent requests and shift priorities easily. They 
are asked to oversee and undertake many different tasks and they need 
to be able to handle stress caused by the pressure to meet deadlines.
6	 A comprehensive knowledge of company processes and procedures
Warehouse supervisors need to have a comprehensive understanding of 
the company’s policies and procedures in order that they can effectively 
train warehouse operatives and coordinate their work. Supervisors are 
likely to be called upon to oversee and undertake many different tasks 
within the warehouse. As such, they need to spend time in all sections to 
get a working knowledge of all operations within the warehouse.
Supervisors need to be involved in and be party to the compilation of 
warehouse procedures and processes. They need to know both the 
administrative and operating procedures.
7	 Ability to train others
Supervisors need to be able to pass on their knowledge effectively to 
their staff to ensure consistency and continuity. Well-trained staff are 
more likely to stay and provide the supervisors of the future.
8	 Be customer oriented
Today supervisors need to be fully aware of customer requirements and 
manage the operation in such a way that customer satisfaction is 

Role of the Warehouse Manager
51
achieved within the parameters set. However, they also need to be 
mindful of costs and the potential trade-offs involved.
9	 Teamwork skills
Supervisors need to be able to set out the goals of the company to their 
team and outline how the team is going to contribute to these goals.
Team-working skills and capabilities include:
●
●ability to work in a group;
●
●ability to build relationships;
●
●ability to cope under pressure;
●
●negotiating skills;
●
●ability to cooperate;
●
●coordination and allocation of tasks;
●
●influencing skills;
●
●ability to compromise where necessary;
●
●ability to make decisions.
Supervisors are paramount to the success of any warehouse operation. They 
are the liaison between employees and management. Needless to say, they also 
need to receive suitable, ongoing training.
One pitfall to avoid is not to promote your best operative without assessing 
their supervisory abilities. Many companies use promotion to award ability; 
however, the best person in a particular job is not always management mate-
rial. This is sometimes called the Peter Principle, where staff are promoted as a 
result of their capability in particular job aspects. This can have a number of 
consequences. For example, by promoting your best picker not only are you 
taking them away from the shop floor but you may also be promoting them to 
a position at which they are no longer competent (they have reached their ‘level 
of incompetence’). Here they stay – or may leave, being unable to earn further 
promotions and potentially harming the company’s operations.
Attracting and retaining warehouse 
employees
Competition between companies in high-density warehouse areas can be fierce 
with staff moving between companies for very little increase in hourly rates. 
This puts a great deal of pressure on management.

Warehouse Management
52
Although many firms see monetary incentives as being key to staff recruit-
ment and retention, a number of surveys – including one by Min (2004) in the 
United States – suggests otherwise with active employee involvement in pro-
ductivity improvement, management commitment to staff, job security and a 
sense of community being seen as high on the list.
Flexible hours, recognition of a job well done, clean and safe working con-
ditions, access to training and open communication are all seen as crucial to 
attracting and retaining staff. Other areas include staff benefits and bonus 
payments. The opportunity to follow jobs through to their conclusion can also 
give staff a sense of ownership and a greater understanding of the business.
Surveys (eg Gooley 2001) have shown that the primary reasons for staff 
leaving their employment isn’t pay but employee discomfort with, or misunder-
standing of, the corporate culture and the general lack of a sense of belonging.
As Chappell (Retail Week 2009) puts it:
Having motivated, engaged individuals working in warehouses is a must if 
you want to be cost effective. However, it’s also about service. If you need the 
warehouse to work above and beyond in times of peak or change, would you  
want a team who is just doing it for the extra overtime or one who is doing it 
because they want the business to succeed?
An ageing and constantly changing  
workforce
This is a challenge faced by many warehouses throughout Western Europe and 
the United States and is beginning to emerge in China also. Experienced staff 
are nearing retirement age with fewer trained staff to replace them as the posi-
tion of warehouse operative is not seen as attractive for today’s youth.
In order to overcome the challenge of staff shortages, organizations are 
visiting schools to teach pupils about the role of logistics in today’s society and 
trying to burst the myth that warehouses are cold, dirty, noisy places in which 
to work. As warehouses become more technically advanced this will also attract 
a new breed of warehouse employee – those with an interest in technology and 
automation.
Attracting younger workers and increasing their job satisfaction early on 
can be key to early integration into the organization, which in turn can lead to 
improved attitude and job performance. Apprentice schemes are ideal in this 
situation.
Companies are also utilizing agency workers in greater numbers; this pro-

and holiday cover. The use of agency staff can also provide flexibility during 
new contract start-up.
As discussed previously, the use of flexible working hours and annual-
ized hours will attract staff who would not normally consider working in this 
environment.
Operating hours
The legislation that surrounds working hours within the warehouse will vary 
country by country. This section outlines some of the options available to the 
warehouse manager in terms of working hours. However, these need to be 
checked against local legislation.
The operating hours of the warehouse will very much depend on the 
throughput and customer requirements.
The classic three-shift system is still used widely; however, with the increas-
ing requirement for 24/7 working, many warehouses have adopted different 
shift patterns.
The classic shift pattern is as follows:
Shift 1: 0600–1400 hours;
Shift 2: 1400–2200 hours;
Shift 3: 2200–0600 hours; and
Shift 4: 0900– 1700 hours.
This shift pattern works on an eight-hour day with 24-hour coverage. However, 
one of the drawbacks is that there is no overlapping shift for the handover of 
information.
Within these shift patterns we also see staff taking breaks at the same time. 
Studies differ on the effect of group breaks on productivity. Some suggest that 
staff interaction at break times is positive and leads to increased productivity 
whereas others will argue that having equipment inactive and orders stacking 
up can be detrimental to overall performance and adds increased pressure on 
the staff. I tend to lean towards the latter.
With the introduction of 24/7 working, a number of companies have adopted 
a four-day working week for staff based on a 12-hour day on a rotating basis. 
See Table 2.1.
Other companies have utilized part-time workers with flexible shifts, working 
around school hours with staff working between 0930 and 1430 hours, for 
example, in order to supplement full-time staff.

Warehouse Management
54
Where 24/7 coverage is not required, typical shift patterns are as follows:
Shift 1: 0600–1400 hours;
Shift 2: 0900– 1700 hours;
Shift 3: 1400–2200 hours.
There can be variations on the above theme. The ideal situation is to ensure 
that peaks in activity are covered as much as possible. This can include the ar-
rival of inbound trucks in the morning and the normally busy period of picking 
and despatch during late afternoon and early evening.
When shift working is adopted, public transport and catering facilities need 
to be available for the staff.
Other considerations include potential congestion during shift changeovers 
and the effect on nearby residential housing of vehicle movements, noise and 
light pollution. In a seasonal business the system of annualized hours can be 
used to cover periods of unpredictable demand. Staff are paid the same amount 
each month but their hours will vary depending on the work content within the 
warehouse operation. This can include working longer shifts during periods of 
increased activity and being sent home when things become quieter.

The adoption of this system provides increased flexibility, reduces the need 
for agency staff and temporary labour and ensures sufficient labour cover 
when demand is high, as a result providing better customer service. Through its 
flexibility and by working with staff it can also contribute to higher levels of 
employee retention.
Rather than pay overtime during periods of high activity, the company can 
‘call in’ these hours without making additional payments.
This system can work efficiently with the cooperation of staff. Whereas 
overtime relies on the goodwill of the employee and their commitments at the 
time, a system of annualized hours should benefit both parties equally. Costs 
are also reduced as there is no additional cost for each hour.
Temporary labour is expensive, not only in terms of the hourly rate but also 
in terms of training, supervision and the likelihood of lower productivity. 
Where temporary workers are utilized it is always a good idea to strike up a 
relationship with a local agency that can provide staff who have received train-
ing specific to your company’s requirements and have also received some form 
of induction.
Training
A whole book can be written on this topic. However, in this section we will 
cover the basics of warehouse staff training.
First, managers need to ensure that all staff receive an induction. For example: 
‘At Boots we set up a three-day induction programme for colleagues joining the 
warehouse, the highlight of which was a day’s stint working in store, seeing a 
delivery being made and working the stock to shelf. It really helped colleagues 
connect what they do with the store operation’ (Chappell 2009). A simple 
process flow map showing the end-to-end supply chain and how each step 
impacts the final customer will engage warehouse staff and make them feel 
part of the bigger process.
Second, the manager needs to undertake a training needs analysis to identify 
which staff require specific types of training. There are always areas in which 
staff need to be trained – the trick is in identifying them.
Effective training helps to engage staff and should be an ongoing process. 
Training across disciplines not only provides the operator with a sense of pro-
gression but builds flexibility into the operation.
From a productivity, but more importantly a safety, point of view, all staff 
operating mechanical handling equipment must be trained on each individual 
piece of equipment and obtain a licence from the authorities.

Warehouse Management
56
Staff must also be shown how to lift heavy items without causing injury as 
back injuries tend to be one of the most common reasons for absence from 
work.
Warehouse audit
In order to assist the warehouse manager to improve processes we have pro-
duced a warehouse audit which can be found in Appendix I.
These lists of questions are not exhaustive and can be added to by the user to 
mirror their own operations. Audits should be undertaken by an independent 
person either from within the company or an outside consultant.
The purpose of the audit should be explained to staff and a timescale agreed 
to introduce the improvements. Results need to be shared with all the staff and 
staff need to take ownership of the results and the improvements necessary.
The audits which are concerned with the internal processes are based on 
what the authors see as best practice in a warehouse.
These audit forms can also be downloaded from www.appriseconsulting.
co.uk/warehousetools (password – apprise1234).
Quality systems
Finally, in this section we have provided a list of quality standards that ware-
house managers may deem necessary or advantageous for their operations.
These are as follows:
●
●ISO 9001 – a standard of requirements against which your Quality 
Management System can be evaluated;
●
●ISO 14001 – a standard of requirements that defines and establishes 
controls to reduce your company’s impact on the environment;
●
●ISO 50001 – a standard of requirements that deals with the energy 
impact of your warehouse operation;
●
●OHSAS – a standard of requirements against which your Health and 
Safety Management System can be evaluated; and
●
●ISO 27001 – a standard of requirements which deals with all aspects of 
information security (this is particularly useful in the case of outsourced 
warehousing).

Role of the Warehouse Manager
57
Summary and conclusion
If a warehouse is going to operate effectively and efficiently it needs an experi-
enced, knowledgeable, well-trained manager and a motivated team of supervisors 
and operators.
An ageing population and difficulty in attracting new staff pose more challenges 
for today’s manager, together with increased environmental pressures.
The warehouse manager’s challenges are therefore many and varied, not 
least the requirement to reduce costs and inventory levels whilst increasing 
customer service.
A comprehensive and ongoing training programme is essential for both 
managers and supervisors. The warehouse should not be seen as a black hole 
but as an essential part of the supply chain, and the role of its staff in this chain 
needs to be recognized and understood.
Quality of service is what sets companies apart these days and the intro­
duction of audits and quality systems into the operation will enable managers 
to continually assess, evaluate and improve their service both internally and 
externally.
The next section of the book examines in detail the processes within the 
warehouse and suggests where the manager can increase productivity and look 
to reduce costs.

Warehouse 
processes: 
receiving and 
put-away
Almost all quality improvement comes via simplification of 
design... layout, processes, and procedures.
(Tom Peters)
Introduction
As Peters says, improvement comes from simplifying processes and procedures. 
These processes need to be aligned and working optimally if we are to improve 
efficiency and, as a result, reduce cost within the warehouse operation.
Detailed process documents need to be produced and made available to all 
employees. These need to be continually reviewed and updated. According to 
WERC (2010) companies who exhibit good to best practice processes define 
and publish process descriptions and assign ownership of the processes to 
responsible individuals. Supplementing written instructions with photographs 
also improves understanding.
In the next five chapters we examine in detail each of the processes associ-
ated with a warehouse operation. Although warehouses differ in terms of size, 
type, function, ownership and location the fundamental processes remain.
These processes include pre-receipt, receiving, put-away, storage, picking, 
replenishment, value-adding services and despatch. We also include a section 
on cross docking where products are moved across the warehouse without 
actually going through the put-away process. Other warehouse processes such 
as stock counting and inventory control, although undertaken as part of the 
mainstream day-to-day processes, are included in the section on housekeeping.

Warehouse Processes: Receiving and Put-away
59
By ensuring that the correct processes are in place and operating optimally, 
companies can not only improve accuracy and efficiency but also take advantage 
of the new technology available.
Many books on the subject of warehousing will concentrate on the picking 
process as this is the most labour and cost-intensive process and has a direct 
impact on customer service.
This section is no exception; however, we also recognize the importance of 
pre-receipt and the receiving process. Receiving the wrong products or putting 
products in incorrect locations can result in errors just as easily as picking the 
wrong item.
Figure 3.1 shows each main warehouse activity as a percentage of cost, 
emphasizing the importance of the pick, pack and despatch operation. These 
figures will vary significantly depending on the type of operation.
For example, companies which are under pressure to speed up throughput 
are likely to use concepts such as cross docking, thus reducing the amount of 
time spent on put-away, picking and retrieval.
The main activities mentioned above are shown in Figure 3.2 together with 
their relationships.

Receiving
Receiving, goods-in or in-handling is a crucial process within the warehouse. 
Ensuring that the correct product has been received in the right quantity and in 
the right condition at the right time is one of the mainstays of the warehouse 
operation. These elements are often termed supplier compliance.
However, it is our contention that once goods have arrived at the warehouse 
it is usually too late to rectify most receiving issues. We believe there are many 
steps that need to be taken before the actual act of receiving takes place.
Pre-receipt
First we need to ensure that the supplier presents the products to the warehouse 
in the most appropriate way. It is normally the buyer who specifies the product 
and therefore may not have knowledge of the goods-receiving operation.
Our suggestion here is that the warehouse manager is also involved in 
specifying and agreeing the packaging, items per carton, cartons per pallet,

TiHi (cases per layer, layers per pallet) and any specific labelling required, 
together with the mode of transport to ensure that the products ordered are 
compatible with the storage facility.
All too often we see items arriving at warehouses in unsuitable packaging 
that overhangs pallets, has incorrect or badly positioned labels and with the 
goods packed in quantities that do not relate to selling-pack quantities. Our 
proposal here is that samples are ordered and despatched in their transit pack-
aging to ensure full compliance.
All these problems take time to resolve and are better handled at the supplier 
prior to delivery.
Areas that need to be discussed both internally and externally prior to the 
order being placed should include:
●
●size and type of cartons;
●
●type of transit packaging – cardboard, plastic, totes, metal stillages,  
roll cages, pallets;
●
●palletized or non-palletized delivery of product;
●
●size (length, width and height) and type of pallets, eg euro pallet, 
four-way entry;
●
●specific labelling such as product description, barcode and quantities;
●
●position of label on carton and pallet;
●
●carton quantities (inner and outer carton quantities, for example); and
●
●mode of transport, delivery quantity and frequency of delivery.
Delivery in the standard selling quantity is also crucial in assisting the man-
ager to increase the speed of throughput and simplify picking. For example, 
many companies still place orders on their suppliers in multiples of 12 yet most 
customers order in multiples of 10 thus causing considerable extra work in 
computing quantities, opening cartons and re-packaging.
The method of delivery needs to be compatible with the unloading equip-
ment available at the warehouse. The lack of loading bays, for example, will 
necessitate the use of tail-lift-equipped or side-(un)loading vehicles.
The transfer of much production offshore has resulted in a significant increase 
in container traffic. The decision here is whether to loose load or palletize the 
cargo. Another option is to use slip sheets.
The benefits of palletizing product include protection from loss or damage 
during handling and transportation and a reduction in the number of people 
required to load and unload containers. The process of loading and unloading 
is speeded up whilst space required at the loading and despatch bays is also 
reduced.

Warehouse Management
62
The trade-off is the reduction of space utilization in the containers. 
Depending on the number of pallets used, this can be up to 10 per cent of the 
space for the pallets alone. Couple that with the clearance height for the pallet 
and the possibility that pallets cannot be stacked and space utilization is sig-
nificantly reduced.
One potential method of reducing the trade-off effect is the use of slip sheets 
in place of pallets. Slip sheets are constructed from fibreboard, thick cardboard 
or thin plastic in the shape and size of the unit load. The thickness of the sheet 
is approximately 2 centimetres.
The load is placed on the slip sheet within the container and on arrival at the 
final destination the slip sheet together with its load is removed by means of 
a specialist forklift attachment and placed on a pallet for storage.
The increasing legislation (FAO ISPM 15) on the use of wooden pallets 
makes slip sheets a viable option for the transport of goods in containers. They 
increase the loading cube within the container, reduce the time taken to offload 
containers and are easier to clean. They do, however, require both despatch and 
receiving warehouses to purchase a special attachment for the forklift truck.
Depending on the load configuration, shipping costs can increase between 
15 and 33 per cent when using pallets. However, there are notable savings 
made at the point of delivery plus the reduction in potential damage to products 
and injury to staff.
The introduction of high cube containers has provided additional internal 
height and therefore the double stacking of pallets becomes more feasible, 
providing the products are not easily crushed.
Finally, containers with large numbers of product lines will still need to be 
sorted at the receiving bay whether they are palletized or loose loaded. In order 
to reduce in-handling time the supplier needs to be instructed to keep the same 
product lines together in the container.
If products arrive loose loaded in a container they will need to be palletized 
prior to being put away in the racking. Where possible these cartons need to be 
constructed in such a way that there is no overhang and no potential for crush-
ing when they are arranged on the pallet and that as many cartons as possible 
can be accommodated within the cubic capacity of the pallet space.
For example, for a 1200 mm × 1000 mm (48″ × 40″) approx pallet with a 
clearance height within the pallet location of 2000 mm (80″), the cartons might 
measure 300 mm × 200 mm × 250 mm, for example, giving a total potential 
pallet cap­acity of 140 cartons if we allow 15 centimetres for the height of  
the pallet and 10 centimetres clearance between the top of the pallet and the  
underside of the beam. Each layer will have 20 cartons and will be stacked seven 
high. There is no overhang on the pallet on either side and cartons are not 
turned on their sides. The following website provides a tool to calculate TiHi: 
http://onpallet.com/

Warehouse Processes: Receiving and Put-away
63
As can be seen in Figure 3.3, the size of the outer cartons does not allow the 
warehouse operation to optimally stack the pallet and can result in increased 
damage.
Utilizing off-the-shelf software can potentially further improve the load-
building capability where the carton dimensions are not so straightforward, 
both on a pallet and within a trailer or container. Not only do the pallets look 
neat and tidy but the products are less prone to damage.
Currently there is no universally accepted standard for pallet dimensions. 
Different market sectors and organizations utilize many different pallet sizes 
around the globe.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sanctions six pal-
let dimensions, detailed in ISO Standard 6780: Flat pallets for intercontinental 
materials handling – principal dimensions and tolerances. These are shown in 
Table 3.1.
Other pallet sizes are seen in the chemicals and printing industries to accom-
modate drums and printer reels, etc. We are currently working with a client 
who receives stock on single use American pallets which they have to ‘slave’ 
(put on top of another pallet) to enable them to place them in their racking 
safely. This not only requires additional labour but also reduces the cubic 
capacity of the storage location. Another client has two different pallet sizes: 
1200 mm × 1000 mm and 900 mm × 650 mm. This makes it very difficult to 
configure storage racks and decide on optimum locations within the ware-
house. This required the use of decking in the racking to safely stow the pallets.
The size of pallet to be stored determines the rack configuration. Where 
companies store different sizes of pallet the configuration needs to be suitably 
Figure 3.3 
Example of incorrectly sized cartons

flexible. For example, UK companies needing to store both UK and euro pallets 
will be forced down the route of having their racking set at 1100 mm deep with 
each 2.7 metre bay accommodating either two UK pallets or three euro pallets.
Companies can utilize timber or mesh decking to accommodate different sizes 
of pallets but this can prove expensive and reduces the load capacity of the racking.
Other factors to take into account when specifying pallets include whether 
they are two-way (stringer) or four-way entry (block), the type of timber used 
(certain countries have restrictions, such as Australia where wood is required 
to be treated) and the type of nails used.
Certain types of MHE are not able to operate with block pallets, reducing 
warehouse flexibility. These include pallet stackers.
Plastic pallets are also becoming more widely used whilst the automotive 
industry has tended to use metal stillages to transport and store automotive 
parts.
Recent innovations in the pallet sector have included iGPS’s plastic pallets 
that are said to be 100 per cent recyclable as well as being 30 per cent lighter 
than wooden pallets.
iGPS also claim that their pallets are ‘vastly better for the environment’ and 
‘do not absorb fluids that can cross-contaminate food’. One concern that has 
worried food manufacturers is the treatment of wood pallets with pesticides 
and fungicides. iGPS’s plastic pallets do not need treatment, so they claim they 
are more suitable for moving foodstuffs in the warehouse.

They have also embedded RFID tags into the pallets to enable tracking to 
take place and there are also barcode and alphanumeric identifiers. The pallets 
measure approx. 48″ × 40″ (1200 mm × 1000 mm) and are four-way entry 
(logistics.about.com).
Products delivered in outer cartons need to be labelled in such a way that 
they can be easily identified. Information can include barcodes, which need to 
be compatible with your radio frequency (RF) equipment and which hold data 
such as product code, description and pack quantity. Ease of identification 
speeds up the in-handling process.
With regard to carton quantities, many suppliers continue to supply in mul-
tiples of 12, yet customers who have grown up with the metric system tend to 
order in multiples of 5 and 10. There needs to be consistency within the supply 
chain in terms of pack quantities supplied, pack quantities stored and pack 
quantities sold.
The pack quantities will depend on the value, weight and volume of the 
product and, although there is no legal limit, outer cartons should not weigh in 
excess of 20 kilograms (44 lbs) from a health and safety point of view.
Individual unit sales will always necessitate opening cases to satisfy orders; 
however, the fewer times this occurs the more productive the warehouse.
There also needs to be consistency by product line to ensure accuracy during 
stock counts and reduce picking errors. I have come across many instances 
where different suppliers of the same generic product pack in different quantities. 
This leads to inaccuracies and delays both on receipt, picking and despatch.
Discussions between the warehouse, procurement, customer services and 
the supplier should alleviate many of these problems.
The premise is to discuss requirements with the supplier and if you need 
them to do things differently then you need to take the initiative. There may be 
an additional cost. However, this needs to be weighed against the additional 
costs incurred within the warehouse. The supplier may surprise you by chang-
ing the way they present things to you. In fact, there may be occasions when 
this is also advantageous to the supplier. The old adage of ‘If you don’t ask, you 
don’t get’ is very true.
Another truism to bear in mind is the 80/20 rule as it applies to suppliers. 
Not only is it likely that 20 per cent of your suppliers provide 80 per cent of 
your stock but it is likely that 20 per cent of your suppliers cause 80 per cent 
of your goods-in problems.
You need to put measures in place to identify the suppliers who are not 
performing to standard and work with them to introduce improvements. You 
can be reasonably sure that your suppliers aren’t deliberately causing you 
problems. The issues arise because they are not aware of the effects of their 
actions on your operation. You will benefit more from a hands-on approach  
to the problem and work with the supplier to improve the situation.

Warehouse Management
66
In-handling
One of the main challenges for a warehouse manager is to match labour hours 
with work content. Handling a product the least amount of time possible (labour 
touch points) leads to reduced labour hours and as a consequence, reduced cost.
Depending on the operation, labour can be the single biggest cost within a 
warehouse. It can be between 48 and 60 per cent of the total warehouse cost 
depending on the amount of automation utilized. It is also the most difficult 
cost to control.
In-handling makes up approximately 20 per cent of the total direct labour 
cost within a retail warehouse.
Preparation
Prior to the actual receipt a number of processes need to take place. The first 
step is to ensure that suppliers deliver into the warehouse when you decide, not 
when it suits them. There will be exceptions to this. For example, it is difficult 
for parcel delivery companies to adhere to booking times because of the nature 
of their deliveries; however, pallet and full-load delivery companies expect to 
be given specific delivery times, albeit this is not their preferred option.
By providing delivery times for each supplier or their subcontractors, you 
are in control and able to match your work hours to work content. A booking-in 
or dock scheduling system needs to be introduced. Many of today’s WMS have 
a dock scheduling module these days however an Excel spreadsheet will suffice.
Initially you need to decide on when you are going to receive products into 
the warehouse. Are you going to have deliveries throughout the day or limit 
them to a morning shift, for example?
You then need to match the length of the time slots to the time estimated to 
fulfil the task. Standard time slots do not work as each delivery is likely to be 
different. For example, it could take 30 minutes to offload a 13.6 metre (45 foot) 
palletized trailer and a further 15 minutes to check and move the pallets to the 
storage area, whereas a loose-loaded 20 foot container could take up to three 
hours depending on the number of SKUs and staff deployed.
You need to keep records of the time it takes for each type of delivery and 
share this information with your booking-in team. This will give you the 
amount of labour and equipment required to undertake the task, thus making 
planning a great deal easier.
By introducing a dock scheduling system you are able to allocate accurate 
time slots, measure productivity, organize labour and also check demurrage 
and penalty charges.

Warehouse Processes: Receiving and Put-away
67
Warehouse staff need to be aware of the products being delivered, the 
type of vehicle and the equipment required to offload. Once this has been 
ascertained and the time calculated, a suitable booking slot is allocated and a 
booking reference given to the supplier.
Details of any pallet exchange agreements also need to be ascertained. The 
use of pallets within a rental system such as Chep, IPP Logipal, LPR and others 
requires both parties to accurately record movements within the system.
Pre-advice of the products being delivered is also advisable so that the 
details can be entered in the warehouse management system (WMS). This is 
normally in the form of an Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN). An ideal method 
of receipt is to accept the contents of the ASN as correct into the system as 
soon as possible through the use of RFID or barcode scanning. Some WMSs will 
use this information to pre-allocate pallet locations for the products prior to 
arrival. The information is also used to check the delivery.
Offloading
On arrival, the vehicle details need to be checked against the booking reference 
and the vehicle allocated a loading bay or location in the yard. Any vehicle 
seals need to be checked against the delivery paperwork.
Prior to offloading temperature-controlled vehicles, the temperature history 
of the vehicle whilst in transit needs to be checked, together with the current 
temperature of the goods.
Once the vehicle has backed onto the appropriate bay or has been posi-
tioned in the yard for offloading from the sides, the in-handling team should 
have appropriate labour and equipment to hand, to efficiently manage the 
offloading process.
Where vehicles are unloaded in the yard this usually necessitates the use of 
two lift trucks, one to unload the trailer and another to put the product away 
within the warehouse.
The introduction of articulated forklift trucks which can work both inside 
and outside the warehouse is going some way to reducing the requirement for 
two different types of truck for the latter operation.
The most common method of unloading palletized vehicles onto a loading 
bay is with a powered pallet truck, hand pallet truck or pallet jack. Some com-
panies utilize counterbalance forklift trucks; however, the weight of the truck, 
driver and load on potentially weak or damaged container or trailer floors can 
be an accident waiting to happen.
Unloading times will vary depending on the equipment used and whether 
the load needs to be staged prior to put-away.

In order to speed up this process, equipment companies have introduced auto-
matic unloading systems, which means that a 26-pallet trailer can be unloaded 
within five minutes of arriving at the dock. Unloading methods include the use 
of rollers, tracks (see Figure 3.4) and slip chains whilst others use loading plates 
or giant slip sheets. These tend to be operated in high volume situations between 
production plants and off-site storage locations.
Combine these with conveyors or automated guided vehicles (AGV) and the 
requirement for labour within the receiving operation reduces significantly.
Unloading loose-loaded containers has always been a time-consuming 
operation. This normally necessitates having at least two people unloading 
within the container and placing the items onto a pallet. A third person is usu-
ally waiting for the pallet to be stacked before taking it to the checking area 
before put away. This is very unproductive as the staff within the container 
wait for full pallets to be replaced with empty ones whilst the forklift driver is 
waiting for the pallet to be built.
There is no guarantee that the same product is together within the container, 
therefore more sortation needs to take place on the unloading dock. This is very 
inefficient and can be hazardous to the staff, who are continually bending and 
stretching within the container and are in close proximity to the MHE. Lighting 
is usually poor and conditions are not conducive to fast, accurate work.
Added problems arise if the warehouse is not equipped with loading bays 
and is dependent on a container ramp or worst still a forklift truck with an 
operator standing on a pallet, which can slow the process even further and has 
its safety issues.
Figure 3.5 shows a boom conveyor unloading cartons from a container. 
These can be static or can be moved between loading doors as required.

Placing cartons onto a conveyor means that sortation can take place outside 
the container, there is less bending and twisting involved as the conveyor is at 
a manageable height and it provides a continuous, uninterrupted flow.
The person within the container can also utilize a vacuum lift to prevent 
injury through bending, stretching and lifting heavy cartons.
Pallets or stillages can be laid out either side of the conveyor and can be 
stacked with the correct item. These pallets can be placed on platforms that rise 
and fall according to the build height of the pallet, thus reducing the amount 
of bending and stretching by the operators.
In order for this operation to run smoothly, the supplier needs to be in-
structed to load the same items together in the container. There is the potential 
of increasing productivity by up to 50 per cent using this process.
With the increase in automation, there is a greater emphasis on uniform 
cartons as robots are now utilized for building pallets both on intake and for 
despatch (see Figure 3.6 below).
In certain operations robots have replaced the manual unloading of containers 
as can be seen in Figure 3.7 below.
Other equipment includes forklift trucks with clamp attachments for offload-
ing items such as white goods and de-layering pallets, rams or poles for offloading

carpets and similar items, rotating clamps for barrels and tyres and forklift

Checking
Once the goods are offloaded, you need to decide whether they need to be checked 
before put-away. The ideal scenario is to move inbound goods directly from the 
loading bay to the storage area or despatch area if goods are cross docked.

However, trust is an issue here and unless you are 100 per cent certain that 
your suppliers are totally accurate with their deliveries on every occasion,  
some form of checking will need to take place.
This can, however, take the form of a random check of certain product lines 
rather than checking the whole consignment. A count of total pallets may be 
sufficient.
A number of retailers have introduced GFR (good faith receiving) where 
products are accepted into the distribution centre or store without checking on 
arrival. Random checks are undertaken and any discrepancies found are 
charged to the supplier on a pro rata basis. This enables drivers to continue 
with their deliveries and pressurizes suppliers to increase the accuracy of their 
shipments.
This can be extended to other operations, providing agreements can be 
made with the suppliers.
Even if GFR is not introduced, by measuring supplier performance a ware-
house manager can decide on the regularity and comprehensiveness of inbound 
product checks. The rate of checking can be based on the accuracy of recent 
deliveries.
A client we worked with checks 10 per cent of the lines on each incoming 
shipment. If they find a discrepancy they will check a further 10 per cent. 
Further discrepancies result in the whole load being checked.
Where new suppliers are concerned it is likely that you will want to check 
the whole of the consignment initially until you are confident of the accuracy 
of the supplier.
There is a trade-off here between the time it takes to check inbound deliveries, 
the delay in the product being entered onto the system and available for sale, 
the number of discrepancies found and the time it takes to deal with them.
Another decision to be made is whether the delivery notes are used to check 
off the delivery or whether a ‘blind’ count is made (in which operators are not 
made aware of the quantities expected until the count has been completed) and 
the actual delivery cross checked against the paperwork once the whole load 
has been received into the warehouse.
From experience, although it is likely to take longer, it is more accurate to 
count the product and then compare it with the delivery paperwork than use 
the paperwork as a checklist.
The utilization of barcode scanners has speeded up the process significantly 
and improved accuracy. Products can be scanned and the details compared in 
real time (if wireless enabled) with the expected quantities to determine any 
discrepancies. Once scanned, the goods can be moved directly to the next 
staging point, be this quality control, a forward pick face, reserve storage or the 
despatch bay for cross docking.

The introduction of RFID will further reduce checking time at the receiving 
bay. Products that have tags fitted can be recognized and counted immediately 
on entry to the warehouse and details passed in real time to the WMS.
Other equipment can include weighing scales for products that are not easy 
to check or are stored and sold by weight.
Aberdeen Group (2009b) has reported that 70 per cent of best-in-class 
companies are more likely than all other companies to receive goods without 
using paper documents. All have migrated to the use of barcodes, RFID or 
voice technology.
Recording and reporting discrepancies both internally and externally are a 
fundamental part of the receiving process.
Table 3.2 shows an example of a goods received non-compliance report.

Cross docking
The goal of most warehouses is to increase throughput rates and reduce the 
amount of stock held. Cross docking is a process where products are moved 
directly from goods-in to the despatch bays. This replaces the need to place the 
product into store and any subsequent picking operation.
Cross docking needs the full support of suppliers as to how they present the 
product. This includes clear labelling and advance notice of arrival together 
with accurate, on-time delivery.
Cross docking requires systems to identify the product that needs to be cross 
docked and a process needs to be in place to recognize and alert the staff.
Once checked in, the products should be taken directly to the despatch area 
and their floor or temporary rack location recorded on the system, alerting 
staff that the product is now awaiting despatch. The details must be recorded 
in order to provide an audit trail.
Other points to take into account include the amount of space available at the 
inbound and outbound areas. Sufficient space is key to moving products quickly 
and safely. Any congestion in these areas will slow up the process appreciably 
and lead to tension between teams. There also needs to be a well-marked staging 
area where the products can be placed prior to despatch. An area of drive-in 
racking can assist in marshalling loads for particular collections.

Cross docking is used significantly in the movement of perishable goods 
through the supply chain and retailers use this system in their distribution 
centres where they receive products from multiple suppliers and sort and con-
solidate them for onward shipment to different stores. It has been said that 
Walmart in the United States delivers approximately 85 per cent of its mer-
chandise using a cross-docking system. This system is prevalent in many retail 
operations today.
Just-in-time systems also rely on cross docking whereby manufacturers 
deliver parts to a cross-dock or sequencing centre where they are consolidated 
and delivered line-side in sequence.
Recording
Depending on the product, there could be a requirement to record more than just 
the standard data such as product code, description and quantity on arrival. 
Other information could include batch or lot numbers and serial numbers. 
Barcode scanning, which we will look at in the following chapters, is ideal for 
this type of data capture.
Quality control
It is accepted that certain products will require more stringent checking on receipt. 
These include high-value items, food, hazardous goods, temperature-sensitive 
product and pharmaceuticals. New suppliers will also fall into this category.
An area close to the receiving bay should be set aside to spot check items on 
arrival. This needs to be done as promptly and as efficiently as possible so as to 
avoid congestion and to get the products onto the system quickly. If there are 
issues, the items need to be taken to a specific quarantine area or, if space is an 
issue, to the storage area – but must be identified as defective or awaiting the 
results of tests. Most WMSs are able to block access to products on the system, 
making them unavailable for picking until cleared for sale. A physical sign at 
the location is an additional failsafe.
Put-away
Many of today’s WMSs allocate product locations in advance and instruct the 
operator as to where to place the goods. This can be directly to the despatch 

Warehouse Processes: Receiving and Put-away
75
area if the product is to be cross docked as discussed above, to the pick face as 
a form of replenishment or to a reserve or bulk-storage location.
In order for this system to work effectively, a great deal of information needs 
to be programmed into the system. This includes the following:
●
●size, weight and height of palletized goods;
●
●results of an ABC analysis or slotting, where fast-moving goods are 
placed closest to the despatch area (an area we will cover later);
●
●current order data;
●
●family product groups;
●
●actual sales combinations;
●
●current status of pick face for each product;
●
●size of pallet locations; and
●
●weight capacity of racking.
Distance of the locations from the receiving and 
despatch areas
In circumstances where there is an absence of such a system, the warehouse 
manager needs to calculate the optimum location for the goods and instruct 
the operators accordingly.
Another decision to take is whether products are placed into fixed or random 
locations. In utilizing fixed locations you are designating a specific location for 
a particular product. A random location is, as it states, where the pallet is placed 
in the most efficient slot available.
Fixed positions enable the picker to memorize the actual location and speed 
up the picking process. However, if there is no stock for that particular prod-
uct at any time, the slot remains empty and pallet storage utilization reduces 
significantly.
Factors to bear in mind when locating product include their specific char­
acteristics. For example, hazardous items need to be stored in an appropriate 
area. Items of high value will also require special storage conditions, which 
might mean a lockable cage or the use of a secure carousel.
When locating cartons, the fastest-moving items should be placed in the 
middle row of shelving so that the order picker doesn’t have to spend time 
bending and stretching. Slower-moving items should occupy the lowest and 
highest shelves.
The warehouse manager also needs to take into account that items should 
be stored in groups by similarity. For example, within an automotive environ-
ment gearbox parts should be stored together in the same area. Added to this, 

Warehouse Management
76
products that often appear together on a pick list should be located side by 
side. For example, a ½-inch bolt needs to be stored next to a ½-inch nut rather 
than the bolts stored together in one area and the nuts in another.
Finally, some warehouse systems will combine put-away with pallet retrieval. 
This is termed task interleaving. The system will instruct the operator to put 
away a pallet en route to collecting a picked full pallet or one that is required 
for replenishment.
Summary and conclusion
The receiving process is crucial to the efficient and effective operation of the 
warehouse.
The following five quick steps should help to improve productivity in the 
receiving and put-away area:
●
●Ensure that you have booked arrival slots for the majority of your 
suppliers.
●
●Reduce the amount of checking required on inbound deliveries.
●
●Have a system in place to prioritize inbound goods, eg prioritize 
low-stock items and promotional items.
●
●Plan your put-away meticulously and ensure product is located 
accurately and efficiently.
●
●Cross dock as much as possible.

Warehouse 
processes: pick 
preparation
Spectacular achievement is always preceded by unspectacular 
preparation.
(Robert H Schuller)
Introduction
Order picking is the most costly activity within today’s warehouses. Not only 
is it labour intensive, but it is challenging to automate, can be difficult to plan, 
is prone to error and crucially has a direct impact on customer service. Typical 
errors include omitting items from the order, sending the wrong item and 
sending the wrong number of items.
Companies target the picking operation as the area in which productivity 
improvements can make a significant difference to overall costs.
The trade-off in this instance is between speed, cost and accuracy. Managers 
are looking for quick response times, high accuracy rates and high productivity 
but at least cost.
Satisfying these factors will determine the types of picking systems and 
processes chosen.
The picking operation has changed significantly over the past 20 years. 
Previously, full-case and pallet picks tended to be the norm. Today, concepts 
such as just in time, the growth in online shopping and significant reductions 
in order lead times have resulted in smaller order quantities and more frequent 
deliveries.
This type of picking is referred to as item, eaches, broken-case or split-case 
picking.

In a 2012 benchmarking survey, WERC used the key performance measures 
shown in Table 4.1 to distinguish best-in-class picking operations.
The imperative here is to ensure that picking accuracy is measured before 
the order leaves the warehouse in order that operatives can be informed of 
their performance and additional training instigated if required.
So how does the warehouse of today achieve best-in-class standards? As can 
be appreciated, there are many interrelated decisions that need to be made and 
aligned for companies to be effective in this area. Figure 4.1 shows the inter-
relationship between labour, technology, equipment and warehouse layout.

Warehouse Processes: Pick Preparation
79
Preparation
As with any logistics process, preparation is a key element.
According to Frazelle (2002), less than 15 per cent of SKUs within a ware-
house are assigned to the most efficient location, resulting in a 10 to 30 per cent 
cost increase in travel time and underutilized locations.
Prior to laying out a warehouse, deciding on the most appropriate handling 
equipment, installing storage systems and deciding on which form of picking 
system to introduce, a full ABC analysis of stock movements and stock held 
should take place.
Understanding ABC classification begins by understanding Pareto’s Law or 
the 80/20 rule.
This states that roughly 80 per cent of effects come from 20 per cent of 
causes. This rule is not universal but it is surprising how often it can apply. The 
idea therefore is to concentrate time and resources on the important 20 per 
cent or the ‘vital few’.
Examples of the 80/20 rule in relation to the warehouse include the following:
●
●80 per cent of sales come from the top 20 per cent of the product lines;
●
●80 per cent of sales come from 20 per cent of the customers;
●
●80 per cent of profits come from 20 per cent of the customers – not 
necessarily the same customers as above;
●
●80 per cent of profits come from the top 20 per cent of products;
●
●80 per cent of the cube usage within the warehouse comes from 20 per 
cent of the products;
●
●80 per cent of the inventory value is in 20 per cent of the products;
●
●80 per cent of problems come from 20 per cent of your suppliers;
●
●80 per cent of complaints come from 20 per cent of the customers; and
●
●80 per cent of staff problems come from 20 per cent of your workforce.
An 80/20 split isn’t always the case, however. One current client’s profile showed 
that based on our calculations 80 per cent of the total units sold came from 
only 5.9 per cent (144) of the total SKUs sold this year (2,443 product lines). 
A further 202 SKUs (8.3 per cent) provided another 10 per cent of the units 
sold whilst the remaining 86 per cent of lines made up the remaining 10 per 
cent of sales.
These analyses allow you to identify not only the highest-selling products 
but also items that are not selling and may be prime candidates for disposal.
As can be seen in Figure 4.2, this rule can be used to identify relationships 
between sales and product lines, sales and weight or cube and sales and the 
number of units sold.

Warehouse Management
80
Pareto’s Law is widely used in logistics and is an excellent method for catego-
rizing items. This is normally termed ABC classification.
In terms of sales, under this classification, ‘A’ is the most important, with 
20 per cent of products producing 80 per cent of sales, ‘B’ is of medium importance 
with say 35 per cent of items producing 15 per cent of sales, and the remaining 
45 per cent being ‘C’ items producing only 5 per cent of sales.
The precise classification of items will vary between companies and market 
sectors. However, in broad terms they are very similar.
Many companies will use an ABC analysis to produce an effective warehouse 
layout. However, the traditional single ABC analysis will only provide a snap-
shot of the current situation based on one parameter – the level of sales by 
product, the idea being that the A items, as the highest sellers, are placed at the 
front of the warehouse, closest to the despatch area.
Unfortunately, using this analysis alone can lead to a reduction in productivity. 
For example, compare the following two products in Table 4.2.
Although product A is the highest-selling item, it is only picked four times 
during the period, whereas product B appears on 200 orders, necessitating 
200 visits to the pick face. Under these circumstances, in order to reduce travel 
distances and time, it is product B that should be closest to the despatch bay.
Returning to our client the next analysis we carried out was based on 
frequency of pick per product line. Here we found that 80 per cent of picks

came from 15 per cent of the product lines. In fact the top 20 most popular 
lines by order frequency made up 35 per cent of the total picks.
It is our contention that the picking area layout should be based on the 
number of pick-face visits taking into account size and weight of the product 
and any special circumstances such as high security items.
For those who want to take quantity into account as well as pick face visits 
a double ABC categorization allows you to combine these two factors into one 
– in this case volume and frequency. This can be done by producing a nine-box 
grid as shown in Figure 4.4.
In this example, AA products are those that generate the most sales and 
are sold most frequently. CC products on the other hand are defined as slow 
movers in that they sell the least and move less frequently.

In terms of picking, the more frequently you visit a pick location the more 
labour intensive it is likely to be. Products in position AA will generate, on 
average, 50 per cent of your sales yet will only be 8 per cent of your product 
range.
Figure 4.5 shows the relationship between the frequency of sales and the 
value of the product. As can be seen, different strategies can be introduced for 
each of the sectors. These can include factors such as the service level provided, 
stock-ordering frequency and method, stock-counting frequency and customer 
and supplier relationships.
There are sophisticated software programs available to enable you to produce 
these results. However, if you are looking for a quick analysis, the following 
method, utilizing the ‘sort’ feature within Excel, will give you reasonable results.
In Table 4.3, the annual demand is multiplied by the number of times the 
product appears on a pick list to give a weighted volume. If we had used the 
volume figures alone the top two products in terms of pick-list frequency would 
have ended up much further away from the despatch area, thus increasing 
travel time appreciably.
It is likely, for example, that product codes 85866, 77577 and 77212 are 
sold in full-pallet quantities and can be stored in and picked directly from the 
pallet racking away from the forward pick faces.
This also reduces the requirement for replenishment for these particular 
products.
The more times you visit a pick face the higher your labour costs are likely 
to be. Travel time within a pick operation can account for up to 50 per cent of 
the total picking time.
Another part of the preparation process is slotting. This is a tool that calcu-
lates the optimum location for products within a warehouse. The tool is used 
to reduce the amount of travel time for operators by not only placing fast-
moving products close to despatch but also places items that frequently ship 
together next to each other in the pick-face area.
For example, in a maintenance stores environment the natural storage 
method for nuts and bolts is likely to be by family and product code: all the 
nuts in one area and the bolts together in another area, although reasonably

close by. Our suggestion is that the same-size nuts and bolts are stored next to 
each other. This is for two reasons: one, they are normally sold together and 
two, it provides a separation between two similar-sized products, eg 3/8-inch 
nut from a 1/2-inch nut. This should lead to a reduction in travel time and 
potential errors.
Table 4.4 is an example of a simple slotting analysis carried out for a client 
recently which shows how often the same products appear on a pick list. This 
only looked at pairs of items. More sophisticated software can look at multiple 
items.
The system can also identify small groups of products that can complete a 
large number of orders. By examining the popularity of the items combined 
with the orders that they complete, these items can be identified and stored 
within a specific area in the warehouse.

Slotting can also determine how many and what size of pick face is required for 
each product line. Very fast-moving lines will require multiple faces to avoid a 
bottleneck at a single location. These need to be spread efficiently across the 
front of the racking nearest the start and finish of the picking run.
Slotting will also take into account seasonality and suggest product transfers 
such as moving garden furniture from the front of the warehouse, where it is 
stored during spring and summer, to the rear of the warehouse during winter. 
Although there is likely to be a reasonable amount of additional handling 
involved, this should be outweighed by an overall reduction in travel, having 
moved the more popular winter products to the front of the warehouse.
The system can also take into account other parameters such as value, cube, 
weight and crushability. Retailers can also set up the system to pick in sequence 
tailored to store layout, thus minimizing the time spent handling the product 
at store.

This software is integrated within many of today’s WMSs but can also be 
sourced separately; payback is normally less than one year.
By profiling the activity of items and orders received into the warehouse, we 
can determine which pick method to use, how much space to allocate and 
therefore where and how to store the product.
The idea is to place the most popular items in terms of pick frequency in the 
most accessible warehouse locations.
We can analyse orders in a number of different ways. One of the most 
common is lines per order. This examines how many different product codes 
make up an order, and as a result we can calculate how many pick locations we 
will visit for each order.
Table 4.5 shows the number of lines (SKUs) per order on average for different 
family groups and also the average number of units per line for a manufacturer 
in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector.
As can be seen in Table 4.5, the family groups of products have different 
profiles. Family groups 8 and 9 have full-carton picks; however, the other family 
groups are predominantly item picks.

This information can help in determining the type of pick operation and also 
the type of storage medium to be used.
We can also drill down further into this information to determine the 
number of lines per order by family group.
If we take family group 6 as an example, we can see in Figure 4.6 that there 
are a larger number of single-line orders together with some large orders with 
multiple lines. Using averages in these circumstances can therefore be misleading.
With such a large number of single-line orders we also need to determine 
whether these are standard orders or possibly back orders.
If they are standard orders then a batch pick (discussed later) is probably the 
most suitable method of picking. Examples of this type of order profile include 
internet sales, small-parts distribution and engineering spares.
Where items are picked from cases, this suggests that the items could poten-
tially be decanted into smaller receptacles and placed in a specific area within 
the warehouse where picking operations can be consolidated.
Allied to the lines-per-order calculation is the ‘cube per order index’ (COI), 
which calculates the ratio of a product line’s space requirement at the pick face 
to the number of picks per day.
This ratio enables you to decide on which position in the pick run a parti­
cular item should be placed. The lower the COI, the better the space utilization 
of the product and therefore, it should be placed nearer to the despatch bay at 
the front of each run of racking.
By combining the two measures we are able to determine the method of 
picking. Multiple orders with a small overall cube can be picked by means of a 
roll cage or trolley whilst larger cube orders will require pallet trucks or pallet 
jacks, for example.

In order to decide on the method of storage for individual product lines we 
need to examine the cube movement distribution. By detailing the items that 
fall into specific cube movement ranges we can decide on the most appropriate 
storage mode.
Figure 4.7 shows an example of cube movement distribution. Approximately 
15 per cent of the total items ship less than 0.5 cubic metres per month, which 
suggests bin, shelf, flow rack or carousel storage, whereas 12 per cent of the 
items ship in excess of 50 cubic metres per month. This would point in the 
direction of some form of pallet storage.
Demand variation distribution enables you to determine the size of the 
pick face and the quantity held for each type of product, the idea being to limit 
the number of replenishments that take place during a day. The ideal is not 
to replenish but have sufficient stock in situ to cover demand over a shift. 
An approximate figure can be derived by calculating the average daily demand 
and the standard deviation for each item.
Table 4.6 is an example of a client’s pick operation that utilizes flow racking 
and has a mixture of full carton and item picks from carton.
As can be seen from this example, the number of cartons stored in the pick 
faces is nearly optimum providing there is no significant deviation from the 
average.
The issue arises when there is a significant daily deviation in the number of 
items picked. For example, if we take product code 989533 with daily pick

quantities of 11, 13, 19, 5 and 7, although the average pick per day is 11 there 
is a wide variation across the week.
In order to accommodate an average day’s demand with a low possibility of 
replenishment, we need to store the average number of cartons picked plus 
two standard deviations for a 5 per cent chance of replenishment and three 
standard deviations of demand for a 1 per cent chance of replenishment during 
the day. This suggests the pick face should contain either 21 or 26 cases for this 
product.
The issue will be whether there is sufficient space available to accommodate 
this amount of stock in the picking area.
The amount of space made available to the pick operation will very much 
depend on the total available cubic capacity of the warehouse, the floor space 
and the amount of reserve stock needing to be stored.
This takes us into the next section, which examines the pick area layout.

Warehouse pick area layout
Having produced a comprehensive profile of the products and orders, we are 
ready to tackle the layout.
Figure 4.8 depicts a very basic layout that has used an ABC analysis based 
on the frequency of pick-face visits. The next step is to minimize the amount of 
travel through the warehouse when picking an order.
The route followed by the picker when assembling the order needs to take 
into account the following:
●
●The pick instruction will have each pick sequenced as per the most 
effective route beginning at the front of the racking nearest the despatch 
bays.
●
●Heaviest items are picked first.
●
●The picker should be able to pick from both sides when moving up and 
down the aisles. See Figure 4.9 below. In this example the aisles are 
numbered, not the rows of racking which means that the picker can

move from side to side as opposed to travelling up the length of the 
racking and back down the other side.
●
●Shortcuts are programmed into the system to minimize travel. For 
example, a break in a long length of racking (as shown in Figure 4.8) 
enables the picker to shorten the travel distance but allows the storage 
of reserve product above the pathway.
●
●The picker ends up as close to the despatch area as possible. If the 
picker is not operating in real time the picker may need to return to  
the start point to pick up a new assignment. This is not ideal.
●
●Multiple pick locations for the most popular items need to be set up  
to avoid congestion at the pick bays.
A typical warehouse layout will operate with a reserve pallet storage area 
(racked or free standing) which may or may not be above the individual pick 
faces. Whether the storage area is separated from the pick area or not will 
depend on the number of SKUs and the amount of floor space available for 
both reserve and pick locations.
This enables the picker to pick full pallets of a product if the order demands 
it. The picker must not be directed to pick a full pallet from the pick location

as this will increase the amount of work required, as that pallet will have to be 
replaced by another through replenishment immediately.
The worst scenario is where the picker takes 30 cartons from the pick face 
and a further 30 cartons from the reserve stock to complete a full pallet order of 
60 cartons of the same SKU. Unfortunately, some WMSs still work on the prin-
ciple of emptying the pick face first, irrespective of the size of order. A manual 
intervention by the picker normally takes place to overcome this situation.
If during the item and order profiling we see that families of items regularly 
appear on orders together and fulfil a large percentage of these orders, it may 
be cost effective to establish a separate area within the warehouse for these 
products. Examples are large customers who only order a specific number of 
products or customers who have bespoke products with their own labelling 
and packaging. A mezzanine floor may be constructed to increase the number 
of pick locations, specifically for smaller, slower moving items.
Third-party shared-user warehousing is a typical example where a number 
of clients share the building but the picking activities are typically segregated.
Where small quantities of items are picked, the warehouse will also have 
an area of shelving where the product may be held in bins or totes to make 
individual-item picking easier. Gravity-fed shelving or flow rack further en-
hances the picking process, where product is fed in at the back of the shelf and 
as the carton, bin or tote is emptied another slides into its place. The key to this 
type of storage is to ensure maximum utilization of the flow rack and timely 
replenishment.
Depending on the height of the building, these may be situated on a mezzanine 
floor, thus increasing the cubic utilization of the building and minimizing contact 
between MHE and the pickers. Although there is a tendency to use mezzanine 
floors for slow-moving items the floors can be linked by conveyors to quicken 
up the pick process by using a pick by zone method.
An alternative to shelf locations are carousels, which are described in greater 
detail in Chapter 5.
When determining the pick layout, you also need to take into account the 
requirement for space to undertake value-adding services such as labelling, 
kitting, packing, shrink wrapping, promotional packing, etc. This area needs to 
be close to both the picking and despatch areas to avoid excessive travelling and 
handling. It also needs to be segregated from MHE movements to safeguard 
the staff. Again, a mezzanine floor is ideal for this type of work. Constructed 
above the inbound and outbound doors not only ensures proximity to the des-
patch area but also utilizes ‘dead’ space.
As picking is a labour-intensive operation, the welfare of the operator has to 
be taken into account when choosing the most appropriate method of picking. 
This includes safe and comfortable MHE, ergonomically designed storage 
modules, work stations and equipment.

Warehouse Processes: Pick Preparation
93
We will discuss how to approach warehouse layout and the choice of equip-
ment in greater detail later.
In the next chapter we determine the most appropriate picking system based 
on the data we have compiled. Information required to determine the most 
effective picking system includes:
●
●dimensions and weight of the product (item, inner carton, outer  
carton, pallet);
●
●product group (hazardous, temperature sensitive, high value, etc);
●
●total number of SKUs by category (ABC);
●
●total number of orders in a period;
●
●total number of deliveries (there is a difference – orders can be 
consolidated into fewer deliveries);
●
●mode and average number of lines per order;
●
●mode and average number of units per line;
●
●pick-face visits per SKU;
●
●item, case or full-pallet picks by SKU;
●
●typical family groupings; and
●
●items sold together frequently.
This data should be gathered during the profiling exercise. Having compiled 
the data, we can now proceed to determine the most effective picking systems.
Summary and conclusion
In order to be productive and efficient in the picking process, a great deal of 
preparation needs to take place. This includes having a comprehensive under-
standing of the products and their sales patterns and the data available to 
produce ABC analyses.
Placing products in the most appropriate location reduces travel distances 
and strain on operatives and as a consequence leads to improved productivity 
and overall cost reduction.
According to OPS (2009) the ‘Ten Commandments of picking’ are as follows:
1	 Design for flexibility and scalability – things change – build for today, 
design for the future.
2	 Keep pickers picking... not waiting or undertaking other tasks such as 
carton erection, packing, labelling, etc.
3	 Minimize travel.

Warehouse Management
94
4	 Minimize product touches. If you have expert pickers you shouldn’t 
need to check their work.
5	 Never let pickers arrive at an empty location.
6	 Measure, measure, measure (productivity and accuracy but also product 
dimensions).
7	 Pick logically, slot intelligently.
8	 Pick accurately – get it right first time.
9	 Continue to learn and explore.
10	 Advocate continuous improvement.
I will add one more to this list: ensure that you make it easy and comfortable 
for the operator. Provide:
●
●good lighting;
●
●ergonomic equipment;
●
●equipment aids (scanners, voice, RFID);
●
●assistance with heavy items;
●
●placement of product – easy-to-reach shelf locations; and
●
●clear and unambiguous labels.
In the next sections we will look at the different picking strategies and the 
equipment utilized. We will also examine the use of automation in today’s 
warehouses which requires a different kind of preparation.

“
Picking 
strategies and 
equipment
Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it’s about 
deliberately choosing to be different.
(Michael Porter (1947–))
Introduction
In this chapter we examine the different types of picking strategies available 
to warehouse managers and the types of equipment used for storage and 
picking.
One of the main cost areas within the picking operation is the movement 
between pick locations. Depending on the operation, this can account for up to 
50 per cent of a picker’s time. The aim is to reduce the amount of travel. 
Congestion at the pick face is also an issue as it can convert travel time into 
waiting time. This section examines the different methods of picking and the 
equipment utilized to attain these goals of reduced travel and waiting time.
There are a number of dimensions to the picking process. These include how 
and when the orders are presented, how the actual items are picked and the 
equipment required. These dimensions are shown in Figure 5.1.
What we can see from Figure 5.1 is that there are many interrelationships 
and many options. For example, if we decide on a picker-to-goods operation 
this can either be done by, for example, picking individual orders, batch or 
cluster picking, utilizing trolleys or pallet trucks and a choice of paper, voice or 
scanning.
The first point to mention here is that in terms of picking there is no ‘silver 
bullet’ or ‘one size fits all’ solution.

Picking Strategies and Equipment
97
According to an Aberdeen Group report (2009), 46 per cent of best-in-class 
companies are more likely than all others to use advanced pick methodologies 
such as batch, zone and cluster picking as opposed to individual-order picks. 
However, each company has different requirements and these strategies may 
not suit everyone.
A picking operation may require full-pallet picks, pallet-layer picks, outer-
carton picks, inner-carton picks or individual-item picks. In most cases the 
warehouse will be required to pick a combination of the above and, at times, 
these combinations on the same order.
Many managers see advanced technology and automation as the silver 
bullet where picking is concerned; however, they may well be overlooking basic 
improvements that can be introduced to enhance order picking efficiency and 
also the potential lack of flexibility that accompanies automation in certain 
operations.
During many of the warehouse management courses I run I tend to find that 
the majority of attendees do not use ABC analysis and order profiling. There 
are many opportunities therefore to improve basic pick operations before intro-
ducing automation.
Basic techniques such as profiling, slotting, pick-route planning, pick-face 
sizing, accurate and timely replenishment, proper equipment selection and 
documented processes will all help to enhance pick efficiency without having 
to introduce technology and automation in the short term.
Companies are likely to operate a number of different order-picking strategies 
and techniques depending on the nature of the product, the quantity of items 
to be picked and the size of order.
There are usually four types of pick requirement within a warehouse. 
However, they do not always occur individually and can be included on the 
same order. These are as follows:
●
●piece, each, unit, item or broken-case pick;
●
●full-case or carton pick;
●
●layer pick; and
●
●full-pallet pick.
In the following sections we will look at each of the pick strategies in turn and 
discuss their interrelationships.
Pick strategies can be split into three categories. These are:
●
●picker to goods;
●
●goods to picker; and
●
●automated picking.

Warehouse Management
98
Picker to goods
The majority of warehouses continue to operate with minimal automation 
and picker-to-goods operations prevail.
Pick to order (individual order pick or discreet order pick)
Here the picker takes one order or part of an order (assignment) and travels 
through the warehouse either on foot with a cage or trolley or with a pallet 
using a pallet jack or fork lift truck, collecting items until the whole order or 
assignment is completed.
Orders can be for individual items, full cartons, full pallets or even a com­
bination of these.
The picker follows a route or pick path designated by reading a paper pick 
list, reading instructions on a radio data terminal or following voice commands.
All order lines are picked in sequence for a specific customer order. Depending 
on the size of the items, piece pick items are likely to be stored on shelf loca-
tions, in carousels or on flow racks for example. Full cartons can be stored on 
pallets in pick locations, on shelving or in flow racking.
The advantage of picking individual orders is the minimum amount of 
handling involved as the product moves from store to dispatch in one handling 
movement.
This remains the most common method of picking. However, orders with 
multiple SKUs and long distances between picks can be very labour intensive.
There can also be a requirement for a second person to check the order 
before it is despatched. This requirement for checking is discussed in greater 
detail in the chapter on despatch.
Cluster picking (sort whilst picking)
In order to reduce overall travel time, operators can take a number of orders 
out into the warehouse at the same time and pick into individual compart-
ments on their trolleys or cages. Some operations will utilize powered pallet 
trucks that can carry two pallets at a time or utilize tugs or tractors that can 
move multiple pallets through the picking aisles as can be seen in Figures 5.11 
and 5.12.
Figure 5.2 shows a pick cart with pick-to-light technology used for cluster 
picking.

Case study 
Consumer Electronics – cluster pick to cart
The client is a global leader and technology innovator in consumer electronics, 
mobile communications and home appliances.
When it set up its new European central parts operation it installed a mezzanine 
floor with shelving, a conveyor system and the Inther LC Pick to Cart system to 
manage over 70,000 spare parts.
To increase productivity and reliability a total of 10 pick carts were introduced 
initially. These carts are used to cluster pick orders both on and below the mezzanine 
floor. Once picked the orders are transported to the packaging and shipping 
department via a conveyor system.
When an operator logs on to a pick cart the Inther LC system will generate a batch 
of picking instructions from all the available orders in the database. When generating 
the instructions the system will use logic to provide the picker with orders in the 
same area and produce the most efficient picking route through the warehouse.  
It will also instruct the picker to pick the highest priority orders first.
The operator is instructed to load the pick cart with empty totes. Each tote must be 
scanned for the system to register the tote against the pick cart. After loading the 
totes the operator can start picking. The central display on the pick cart will show the 
location to pick from. After the operator confirms the location by scanning its barcode, 
the corresponding pick lights light up with the requested quantities to pick. The 
operator must pick the articles and confirm the pick by pressing a button. Omitting

and shortage functionalities are also available. After the products from the first 
location are allocated to the totes, the next location is shown on the central display.
When all orders are picked the operator unloads the totes from the pick cart onto 
a conveyor that transports the totes to the packing workstations. When the pick cart 
is empty, it is ready to start a new cluster of picks.
Each pick cart can be used, without recharging, during a full eight-hour shift. A 
battery is installed on the pick cart to provide power for the pick lights, hand scanner 
and wireless controllers.
In the above example plastic totes are utilized. These may or may not be the 
final shipping containers. The totes can be replaced by cartons thus reducing 
the number of touch points by not having to decant the totes. A check weigh 
system can be used at the shipping area to ensure accuracy.
Although having the advantage of being able to pick several orders at the 
same time and reducing overall travel, it does need experienced pickers if a put-
to-light system is not utilized. There is a possibility of putting the wrong product 
or wrong quantity of product into a container and therefore a check system 
needs to be in place to ensure picker accuracy.
Cluster picking can also be used with conveyors, where a tote containing 
multiple orders diverts into a pick zone. As the tote passes a barcode reader its 
unique ID is read and all the picks for the current tote are displayed on the 
individual pick-to-light terminals.
Each terminal indicates both the quantity to be picked and the tote location 
where it is to be placed. A pick of eight pieces into the B compartment would 
be displayed as B8. When all picks for all compartments in the current zone are 
complete, the tote is returned to the conveyer belt and it proceeds to the next zone, 
where additional picks for any compartment are required (elogistics101.com).
The number of orders per cluster will depend on the number of lines, units 
per order, total cube and the capacity of the totes, cages or trolleys.
As seen above we have a combination of technologies and pick strategies.
Batch picking
Batch picking is where operators pick products for a number of orders at the 
same time. This is similar to cluster picking however rather than have a cluster 
of separate orders, these orders are consolidated into one pick list and once 
picked are later broken down into their constituent orders. Pickers can be sent 
to the reserve storage area to pick full pallets or layers of pallets to satisfy the 
order quantities.

Picking Strategies and Equipment
101
There are two alternatives: pick by line and pick to zero. Pick by line may 
result in excess items being returned to stock where full pallets or cartons have 
been picked. For example, a batch of 10 orders may require 100 units to be 
picked in total. A full pallet holds 120 units and is brought to the order con-
solidation area. Once the 100 units have been picked the additional 20 units 
are returned to the reserve storage area or possibly transferred to the forward 
pick area. In the case of pick to zero the correct number of items (the 100 units 
in this case) are picked and allocated to customer orders until the lines and 
units are exhausted. This is also termed bulk picking.
Advantages include less travel and potentially increased accuracy as two 
people are involved in the pick and allocation process. The disadvantage is that 
it is a two-stage process and cannot easily manage time-sensitive orders.
Batch picking can significantly increase the number of lines picked per hour; 
however, you also have to take into account the collation of the items.
The system can be utilized within a cross-dock operation where products 
can be picked and allocated on arrival at the warehouse. This removes the put-
away and replenishment aspects of the operation and increases throughput and 
accuracy.
Orders can be batched in a number of different ways. For example, mail 
order or e-commerce operations may well batch by single order lines or single 
items. A typical usage is in televised home shopping such as the QVC channel. 
Different products are promoted at certain times of the day and orders are 
placed for them. This results in a large number of orders for a single product. 
Each order is likely to be for potentially one or two units. It makes sense to con-
solidate these orders into one pick list and pick large quantities of the product 
in one pass. It is then simply a case of attaching a shipping label onto each item 
for despatch.
Orders containing similar items can also be batched together. Finally orders 
can be split, based on where the products are in the warehouse.
Batching orders together can be done manually; however, most warehouse 
management systems (WMSs) today have this capability.
Technology such as put-to-light systems can be used to help ensure accuracy. 
As the bulk picked products are brought to the sorting or consolidation area 
each product line is scanned in turn and lights will indicate how many of each 
product should be placed into a tote or container for shipment. This can be 
used successfully for multiple retail store delivery with each store having its 
own cage, tote or despatch area.
Zone picking
In zone picking, products are picked from defined areas in the warehouse and 
each picker is assigned to a specific zone or zones and only picks items from 

Warehouse Management
102
within those zones. The level of activity will determine the number of zones/pick 
locations allocated to each picker.
Orders are moved from one zone to the next as each zone completes its pick. 
This movement can be undertaken by a cage, trolley or pallet being passed 
from one operator to another but is more commonly done by conveyor. The 
conveyors may be powered or use rollers or gravity to move the cartons or 
totes between the zones.
Orders can be picked simultaneously within the zones and consolidated 
later or they can be picked sequentially. Separate pick instructions are produced 
by the WMS for each zone for simultaneous picking. A single pick list travels 
with each order for sequential picking.
The volume of orders sent to each zone needs to be controlled so that each 
sector has an equivalent amount of picks. The potential for bottlenecks can be 
high with staff having to wait for orders to arrive.
Zones are usually sized to accommodate enough picks for one or two order 
pickers. A picker may look after two zones or more if the volumes are reduced 
on a particular day.
Zone picking can be effective in operations with large numbers of SKUs, 
multiple orders and low to moderate picks per order. DVD and computer 
games retailers are typical examples.
The most popular picking method utilized in the zones is pick by light. 
As an operator scans the next order to arrive in the zone, a number of lights 
illuminate in the section. A digital display denotes the number of items to be 
picked. Once the pick is completed the light is turned off and the picker goes 
to the next illuminated location.
Some companies will also scan the barcode on the product prior to placing 
it in the tote to ensure that the correct item has been picked.
Advantages include the reduction in travel and an increase in the speed of 
pick as multiple lines can be picked at the same time compared with pick by 
order.
This system can be used by companies where there are different zones for 
product families such as pharmaceuticals, hazardous items and food items.
Wave picking
In wave picking, orders are combined and released at specific times during  
the day or to associate them with vehicle departures, replenishment cycles,  
shift changes, product locations, product commonality, value-adding service 
requirements and priorities. The use of wave picking can also balance work-
load by time or by area by logically grouping and releasing orders.
Orders can be released at different times to different zones based on how 
long it takes to pick the orders. The drawback is the requirement for a further 

Picking Strategies and Equipment
103
step in the process, having to bring the partial orders back together. However, 
as discussed with batch and zone picking, it does allow for a second check on 
product codes and quantities.
Goods to picker
Significant benefits can be realized with the use of a goods-to-person system. 
Even though there are many variations on how a system can be configured, 
most of the designs allow the following benefits, according to Dematic (2009):
Eliminate picker travel time, use less labour. Order pickers do not need 
to roam the warehouse walking to and from the dedicated pick faces. 
Travel time is the largest time component of a traditional order picker 
in a person-to-goods arrangement. By minimizing this time component, 
productivity is increased and labour to operate the facility is reduced.
Omit the dedicated pick face. Typically, a goods-to-person system involves 
storing the inventory in very narrow aisle racking or an AS/RS system. 
Each SKU is retrieved when it is required. The system dictates when  
the item is picked and it is less important where it is in the warehouse, 
although having the fastest-moving items closer to the workstation will 
further improve efficiencies.
Reduce system footprint. The space required for a goods-to-person design 
is much less than conventional person-to-goods. If the storage medium 
is high density, significant space savings can be achieved. A typical 
footprint may be 30 to 50 per cent less than conventional storage.
Product security. When the product is placed into a high-density automated 
system (AS/RS), it is secure and not available for access by staff. Product 
security is important to maintain inventory accuracy, reduce theft, and 
assure first in, first out principles.
Ergonomic workstations. The pick stations can be designed for employee 
comfort. Working heights, range of motion and environment (lighting, 
temperature) can be optimized for the employee. Some designs omit the 
requirement to move and lift totes/cartons. Furthermore, workstations 
can be outfitted to support special needs employees, thereby allowing 
universal access.
Speed in order selection. The pick station design allows high worker 
productivity. Since there is little or no travel time and the item to  
be picked is ergonomically served to the worker, high rates of order 

Warehouse Management
104
selection are achieved. Most operations obtain rates of 500 to  
1,000 lines picked per hour per operator. The goods-to-person  
system allows fast- and slow-moving SKUs to be treated equally,  
which removes the need for separate pick areas based on SKU velocity. 
This is important for applications where SKU velocity changes on a 
daily basis.
Accuracy. Order picking using a goods-to-person station tends to be more 
accurate because operators are typically handling one SKU at a time, 
making errors less likely. Most goods-to-person stations utilize put-to-
light technology to indicate quantity and location to place the item, 
further enhancing accuracy. The picking process is performed by one 
person, thereby improving traceability. Accuracy during the inbound 
process is paramount.
Decoupled workstations. Staff can work in parallel, unaffected by 
each other. Stations can be opened and closed according to business  
volume on a particular shift of operation. There is redundancy in this 
configuration since items can be processed at any location as the 
workstations are completely decoupled.
High-utilization workstations. Work flows into the pick station smoothly 
and consistently. Order pickers are highly utilized, since they do not 
need to wait for work. Worker productivity is not affected by the 
structure typical of a traditional pick module (high activity in one  
zone, little activity in another zone, pace issues in a pick-and-pass 
environment, etc).
Sequencing. When building a customer order, a precise sequence of SKUs 
can be achieved. For example, items can be presented to the order 
selector by weight (heavy to light). Or, in another example, orders  
can be built in sequence by family group.
Order profile. The system is not affected by changes in order profile. For 
example, single-item orders and multi-item orders are accommodated 
with equal efficiency. This means that trends such as more orders with 
fewer order lines do not compromise productivity. This feature adds to 
the ability of goods-to-person systems to accommodate change as order 
profiles change in the future.
Efficiently accommodates SKU growth. If more SKUs are added, the 
storage system can absorb the new loads (if sized for growth) or the 
system can be expanded with additional automated storage modules,  
or existing modules can be extended.

Types of automated picking
The requirement for increased speed, accuracy and productivity has pointed 
managers towards automation as a realistic option in today’s competitive 
automated equipment market. A high-volume item pick operation is an area 
where automation can have a high impact. An operation where the despatch 
of upwards of 3,000 cartons per day is worth consideration in terms of 
automation.
The advantages of automation include the following:
●
●increased space utilization and reduced space requirement;
●
●high bay, narrow aisle systems (up to 30 metres high);
●
●random storage;
●
●higher density storage for refrigerated products, leading to cost 
reduction through lower energy requirements;
●
●improved control;
●
●pallet tracking through enhanced WMS;
●
●labour and energy savings;
●
●no heat and light requirement unless required for product integrity;
●
●minimum supervision required;
●
●continuity;
●
●24 hours, 7 days per week operation;
●
●product security;
●
●high bay areas, use of first in, first out principles;
●
●less human intervention;
●
●safety;
●
●elimination of manual handling;
●
●reduction in accidents;
●
●ability to cope with hazardous/harsh environments such as refrigerated 
storage;
●
●integration;
●
●coordination of product flows, avoiding bottlenecks;
●
●constant performance levels; and
●
●continuous review.

Examples of automated picking systems
Compact picking system
The goods-to-picker-based compact picking system by Vanderlande is ideal for 
slow-moving products in retail and wholesale warehouses. It is also cost effective 
for warehouses handling parts and components for sectors such as the automotive 
industry which have a large range of SKUs and very high service levels.
For example, in a manufacturing warehouse product is retrieved from the 
automated storage and retrieval area and taken by conveyor to the operator’s 
workstation. There it is consolidated with other items that do not fit the profile 
such as exhaust systems, gearboxes, body panels, etc. They are then placed in a 
shipping carton, a crate or on a pallet for despatch. The use of ergonomic 
workstations enables operators to achieve a constant high order picking per-
formance (up to 1,000 order lines per operator per hour) over a prolonged 
period of time, without risk of work-related injury.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMAC0b1MlmY#t=41
Order distribution system
An order distribution system is ideal for business processes where a large 
number of order lines are fulfilled from a relatively small number of SKUs. Totes 
or cartons of single-line products are transported to operators who distribute 
goods into order totes controlled by put-to-light displays. This concept works 
efficiently in mail order and e-commerce sectors.
In both the above operations the workstation plays a major part in the overall 
system. The main features include:
●
●optimal ergonomics because of horizontal order picking (one level);
●
●ideal height for the operator using a movable platform;
●
●operator learning curve of only 15 minutes;
●
●constant productivity level through fatigue-free working; and
●
●high accuracy and safety by pick-to-light displays, detection light grids 
and a touch screen.
Mini-load AS/RS systems
A mini-load automatic storage and retrieval system handles loads that are con-
tained in small containers or totes, with load weights typically falling in a range 

Picking Strategies and Equipment
107
of 40 to 250 kilograms. The capacity range can go to 350 to 1,000 kilograms 
at the high end. The system is ideal for storing small quantities of large numbers 
of SKUs. ‘Slave’ trays can also be used to transport shipping cartons to reduce 
the amount of decanting within the warehouse.
One key feature of a mini-load system is that it maximizes the cube of the 
warehouse, saving space whilst increasing throughput. Recent innovations 
include double-deep locations thus further increasing space utilization.
Product is put away in random locations and the system manages the 
put-away and retrieval of the product. Dynamic slotting enables fast-moving 
products to be located in the most accessible locations. When a part is required, 
the system will identify the location and the tote or tray will be transferred to 
the operator, who is standing at a pick station located in front of the rows and 
columns of storage bins.
Once the item has been picked from the tote, it is returned to a position in 
the racks. Different SKUs can be stored in each tote providing the operator has 
the ability to distinguish one part from another. Picking is normally managed 
by put-to-light systems which denote the quantity and into which outgoing tote 
to place the item. Some systems can provide a photograph of the item on screen 
to ensure further accuracy.
Each pick station can have multiple totes arriving and leaving at the same 
time, ensuring an effective flow of goods and increasing productivity. This is 
similar to batch picking by line (350 to 700+ lines per hour). See Figure 5.3.
3D shuttle technology
Although an AS/RS system, the Cimcorp 3D shuttle™ uses gantry robot tech-
nology, combined with an innovative shuttle device integrated into the gantry, 
Figure 5.3

Warehouse Management
108
to store and retrieve goods in plastic crates, totes, bins and containers required 
for order fulfilment. The system creates stacks on entry to the storage area. 
These stacks are then collected by one of the gantry robots and deposited 
somewhere within the robot’s working envelope.
When a particular SKU is required to fulfil an order, a robot retrieves the 
corresponding tote and deposits it on the shuttle device. The shuttle travels 
along the gantry and transfers the tote to the outfeed conveyor, which then 
transports it to a conveyor line that feeds the picking stations.
Once picking from a tote is complete, it is conveyed back to the entry point 
to the storage area.
The system’s advantages are as follows:
●
●Up to six times more efficient than a manual solution.
●
●Productivity of up to 1000 totes/hour.
●
●Low investment cost.
●
●Excellent cost/storage capacity ratio.
●
●No racking required resulting in significant cost savings.
●
●Optimum space utilization with no space wasting aisles.
●
●Exceptionally high storage density.
Example 3D shuttle cell (two robots)
Throughput capacity: up to 5,000 totes in or 1,000 totes out per one hour by one 
cell/two shuttle robots (stacks in/single totes out). Average throughput 500 totes 
in and out/hour.
Storage capacity of 31 totes per m2, tote size (L × W × H) = 600 × 400 × 
250  mm, storage size 25,000 totes per cell.
SKU quantity enables thousands of SKUs (31 SKUs per m2).
The advantage of this system is that it doesn’t require any racking or grid 
structure with 80 per cent of the operational time feeding the pick stations.

Autostore
Autostore is an AS/RS system which stores goods in bins that are stacked 
directly on top of one another in a self-supporting aluminium grid. The grid 
not only guides the bins but also serve as rails for the robots to travel on. The 
battery operated robots are controlled using a wireless system and manoeuvre 
the bins within the grid. They also transport the bins to and from workstations 
for goods to be decanted or picked. Bins containing fast-moving products are 
stored at the top of the storage system whilst slow-moving stock is stored in the 

Picking Strategies and Equipment
109
lower sections. Once the goods are placed in the bins they are ready for picking 
and despatch.
The system uses less energy than a mini-load system and is scalable.
Case study 
 Asda Stores
Founded in the 1960s, Asda is one of Britain’s leading retailers with over 180,000 
dedicated Asda colleagues serving 18 million customers. The second largest 
supermarket chain in the United Kingdom, holding around 18 per cent market share, 
Asda is part of the Walmart group, the world’s largest retail chain.
Asda is unsurprisingly a leading proponent of warehousing innovation. The 
business is constantly looking at ways to improve the use of space within its existing 
distribution centres. Asda selected Swisslog’s AutoStore solution to handle a range 
Figure 5.4 
Cimcorp 3D Shuttle

Warehouse Management
110
of its products in a more space efficient and productive way. An intelligent storage 
and retrieval system for small case lines, the solution provides Asda with flexibility for 
its future expansion. Swisslog worked with Asda at each phase of the project from 
the initial design to the installation and ongoing support. Work started on-site in 2012. 
Before installation of the AutoStore system could commence a robust mezzanine 
level was built on which the new solution would be constructed. Once the preparation 
work was completed, installation and commissioning took place in a matter of months, 
as the rest of the IDC was in full operation.
The operation:
1	 Decant
Pallet loads of inbound goods are conveyed automatically to one of six 
ergonomic decant stations. An Asda colleague working at each station transfers 
products from a pallet into AutoStore bins, whilst lift tables eliminate the need  
for bending, thereby making the whole process highly ergonomic. Each station 
also has a chute for colleagues to dispose of waste.
2	 Picking
The AutoStore robots always work ahead of colleagues to ensure a constant 
stream of bins are presented at the picking port. Reaching required bins usually 
involves a digging process, which temporarily stores those above the required 
bin on top of nearby stacks.
The solution includes carousel picking ports, designed for high throughput 
operations. These ports have three rotating arms which are able to carry three 
bins simultaneously in order to provide seamless delivery to colleagues. With 
10 ergonomic picking stations, where orders are collated for store delivery, the 
site is able to process a large quantity of orders. They’re also aided by the robots 
delivering the bins in sequence. Each colleague has a touch-screen computer 
instructing on how many of each product line to pick for particular orders, moving 
them from the captive AutoStore bin into the store consolidation tote. Once all items 
for a store are picked, colleagues push the tote onto the conveyor for shipping.
3	 The benefits
From the outset, the system enables Asda to manage several thousand different 
product lines, whilst allowing further phased investments to accommodate more 
bins, in line with the retailer’s developing requirements. AutoStore’s key benefit is 
that of space efficiency, allowing for maximum utilization of the area, in this case 
bolstered by its installation on a mezzanine level. This leaves the ground level 
available for other operations.

Ergonomic workstations
As with all goods-to-person systems the comfort and safety of staff are paramount. 
Ergonomic workstations are therefore used in conjunction with goods-to-picker 
solutions.

Warehouse Management
112
The workstations are designed to enable continuous, sustainable performance. 
The goal is to counter the risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI) and fatigue, thus 
increasing effective operator time.
These ergonomic workstations are also important from a disability worker 
point of view. Many warehouse and distribution centres such as those operated 
by M&S in the United Kingdom and Walgreens in the United States are design-
ing their warehouses with disabled staff in mind.

Product profile 
RapidPick workstation
Dematic has introduced a workstation (RapidPick), which can be fully tailored to 
match the individual requirements of the operator. As a first step, operator platforms 
and work tables are adjustable for height. This allows the stations to be optimally 
adapted to different body sizes, whilst also providing flexibility in terms of the volume 
of totes or cartons to be processed. Moreover, the picking stations feature optimal 
workplace lighting, large and comfortable operating controls and acknowledge 
buttons. Height- and rake-adjustable human–machine interaction (HMI) screens are 
also part of the ergonomic equipment package.
The HMI display provides the visual management of the pick processes. Its 
multicolour, high-resolution screen displays simple, intuitively understood symbols 
for article volumes, photos of the products to be picked and a 3D description of the 
positioning of the picks in the order carton. All these features contribute to accurate, 
safe order picking with virtually no error rates. As optional additional verification, 
volume weighing can be integrated into each picking station.
A further distinctive feature adding to the high throughput capacity of RapidPick is 
the possible configuration of the automated sequences in the picking process. In 
addition to the empty tote/carton management for the order cartons, the station can 
be equipped with two conveyor tracks – one behind for the donor totes, one in front 
for the order cartons. The donor totes are automatically presented at a frequency 
that is optimal for the packing sequence of order fulfilment and transferred to the 
picking station by the conveyor system. The totes/cartons are presented ergonomically 
to the operator to ensure that picking access is comfortable. Picking to the order 
carton is directed by the visual parameters shown on the display screen. Each 
placement in the order carton is confirmed via a terminal or an acknowledge button. 
Once the order is consolidated, the superimposed IT system triggers the automatic 

Picking Strategies and Equipment
113
removal of the donor totes and order cartons. If totes become empty during picking, 
they are buffered in the station and used in the ongoing process as order cartons 
when directed to do so by the IT system.
The expectation is that these workstations will pick up to 1,800 units per hour at 
full capacity.

There is still a low take-up of fully automated warehouses. As can be seen in 
Figure 5.7, automation does not figure highly in this sample of warehouse 
operators. Automation is a big step to take and it is a decision that should  
not be taken lightly. A recent survey undertaken by Peerless Research Group 
showed that 70 per cent of the respondents in the United States were plan-
ning on spending less than $250,000 dollars on warehouse equipment this 
year (2013) with only 11 per cent contemplating the purchase or evaluation 
of automated systems.
You should not under any circumstances automate a bad or broken pro­
cess. Always ensure that your warehouse operation is working as efficiently as 
it can without the use of technology. It is only when you are at this stage that 
you should contemplate using technology to further improve the operation.

Processes need to be as streamlined as possible and any unnecessary steps 
eliminated.
The following case study is an example of how a company has fully em-
braced automation to improve efficiency and reduce the total footprint of their 
warehousing.
Case study 
Automated storage Maspex Wadowice, Poland
Maspex Wadowice Group is amongst the leading Polish companies in the food 
industry, being the market leader in the production of juices, nectars and soft drinks 
in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia, and a main player in Hungary, Bulgaria and 
Romania.
Their challenge was to amalgamate operations from different regions in Poland, 
requiring a warehouse with large storage and handling capabilities, mixed pallet 
picking and assembly, full traceability and error-free inventory and deliveries.
Amongst many options evaluated, a highly automated solution proposed by 
System Logistics was selected, as it fulfilled all the requirements and achieves a 
reasonable payback of the investment.

A storage capacity of 54,000 pallets has been obtained within an area of nearly 
9,000 square metres, installing a self-cladding rack, 35 metres high, within which operate 
15 stacker cranes, each one of them able to handle two pallets at a time. In front of 
the rack is a four-floor building. The shipment area is on the ground floor, adjacent to 
the receiving area, and is designed to load over 10 trailers every single hour.
The first floor is connected by a pallet conveyor to the factory located on the other 
side of a public road. Situated on both the first and second floors are the case-picking 
activities, based on the goods-to-man principle, producing double the productivity of 
staff through the use of ergonomically designed workstations.
Layer-picking activity is carried out on the third floor, by means of two automated 
robots which are able to fulfil more than 60 per cent of the total picking volume. To 
cope with the high flow of pallets required, the handling system on each floor uses 
the system vehicle loop (SVL) monorail steering shuttle technology. The result is 
therefore a particularly compact installation.

Automation requires a great deal of preparation and time spent on design, 
evaluation and implementation. Automation can provide significant improve-
ments in productivity and accuracy – but it can also prove to be the wrong 
solution.
In 2004 a major supermarket chain in the United Kingdom had to write off 
over a quarter of a million pounds’ worth of automated equipment and IT 
systems due to the failure of the system to improve on-shelf availability.
Continuing to do what you’ve always done but more quickly and poten-
tially with less paper is not going to improve your overall performance. As 
Drucker (nd) said, ‘Do not believe that it is very much of an advance to do the 
unnecessary three times as fast.’

Automation has its place; however, there are a number of disadvantages. These 
include:
●
●High opportunity cost: could the investment have been spent more 
effectively elsewhere?
●
●High investment costs: building, equipment, information technology.
●
●System failure: operations are entirely reliant on technology.
●

Robotics
Robots are a common sight in manufacturing operations and on automotive 
production lines. However, they are rarely seen operating in warehouses.
Robots in the form of automated guided vehicles utilized for transferring 
pallets within the warehouse have been in use for a number of years, but they 
have been a rarity within picking operations.
However, things are beginning to change and robots have been adapted to 
pack items into boxes and stack those boxes onto pallets in the most efficient way.
The use of robots in the pick process is also beginning to increase. These are 
in areas where labour is scarce or very expensive, where the tasks are reasonably

straightforward or where the operation is undertaken in hazardous conditions 
where manual handling is deemed dangerous.
Examples of the use of robotic arms fitted with suction pads and an optical 
reader being used to pick items from a conveyor and deposit the items into 
their respective containers are beginning to appear.
Product profile 
Schäfer Robo-Pick
Schäfer Robo-Pick is the first fully automatic picking cell that can be smoothly 
integrated into existing warehouse architectures. It is neither necessary to enter 
article characteristics into the system nor to place the articles in special positions in 
the storage tote. An innovative two-step image-processing system automatically 
recognizes the position of the products on the tray and controls the universal picking 
robot. Schäfer Robo-Pick achieves up to 2,400 picks per hour in continuous operation. 
According to SSI Schäfer, the Schäfer Robo-Pick cell is a particularly economic 
system, the investment costs being far below the costs for corresponding conventional 
goods-to-person stations with equivalent picking performance. See Figure 5.9.

Another recent innovation has been the introduction by Kiva Systems of a pick 
operation where mini AGVs or robotic drive units move free-standing shelving (pods), 
arranged in rows and columns in a memory-chip-like grid, from a storage area to  
pick stations. When a consumer submits an order, the robotic drive units deliver  
the relevant shelving units to workers who pack the requested items in a box and

ship them off, utilizing other drive units, to the despatch bay, allowing workers to fill 
orders two to three times faster than they could with conventional methods. Each 
pick station is equipped with a pick-to-light and put-to-light system. The drive units 
can work in parallel, allowing dozens of workers to fill dozens of orders simultaneously.
The robotic system is also faster because the entire warehouse can adapt, in real 
time, to changes in demand by having the robots move shelves with popular items 
closer to the workers, where the shelves can be quickly retrieved while items that 
aren’t selling are gradually moved farther away. This becomes a very sophisticated 
slotting system. This is all controlled by radio frequency with floor labels providing 
the drive units with the location coordinate information they require to navigate the 
warehouse.
According to Kiva, the system is capable of up to 750 picks per hour, per worker. 
The system is modular and scalable but very system dependent and unless a mezzanine 
floor is utilized does not use the cubic space of a building efficiently. See Figure 5.10.

These systems remain expensive and at present require reasonably uniform items. 
A fully equipped 100,000 square foot warehouse reportedly costs between £3 and 
£5 million to fit out. Depending on the operation, payback has been estimated at any­
thing from three to five years or beyond.
Since the first edition of this book was published, the company has been purchased 
by Amazon who had installed the system into some of their DCs.

Picking Strategies and Equipment
119
Handling equipment
Warehouses have a number of different types of handling equipment at their 
disposal to undertake the picking process. These range from relatively cheap trol-
leys through mechanical equipment to large conveyor and automated systems. 
Figure 5.7 shows the results of a survey undertaken by Cranfield University into 
the types of equipment utilized in UK warehouses. As we can see, there remains 
a heavy reliance on picker-to-goods systems with the use of pallet trucks, lift 
trucks and the utilization of shelving and racking as storage media.
In this section we examine some of the equipment used in picking operations. 
A point to note here is that companies utilize a combination of equipment to 
handle different types of products and order profiles.
Manual and mechanical handling equipment
This equipment is the least capital intensive and the most labour intensive.
Trolleys/cages/carts/garment rails
These are pushed along picking aisles or shelving by pickers and have shelves 
or compartments or slots into which the picked items are placed or hung. They 
are used in both item and full-carton picking. The aisles are usually a minimum 
of one metre wide.
Productivity is relatively low (50–80 lines per hour) with pickers spending 
over half their time propelling the equipment rather than picking. Tiredness 
also becomes an issue later in the shift.
Roll cages can also be utilized for transportation, thus reducing the need for 
double handling.
Hand pallet truck, pallet jack, powered pallet truck, 
manual stacker truck
Hand pallet trucks have hydraulic pumps to enable the operator to lift a pallet 
sufficiently to be able to move it across the warehouse floor. They are cost 
effective for transferring pallets across short distances.
Powered pallet trucks are used for loading, unloading and picking full 
cartons (although item picking is possible) and for pallet-transfer duties to 
and from the receiving and despatch areas. They can be supplied as pedestrian, 
stand-on or seated versions.
The choice of truck will depend on pallet throughput per hour and distances 
travelled within the warehouse.
Advances in this area include pallet trucks which have a lift ability up to 
800 mm in height.
Manual stacker trucks have a 1,000 kg lift capacity up to 3 metres, depending 
on the model.

Warehouse Management
120
Forklift trucks
In the absence of pallet trucks both counterbalance and reach trucks can be 
utilized in the picking process and each has the advantage over pallet trucks of 
being able to lift a pallet to a height such that the operator doesn’t have to bend 
down to place cartons onto the pallet. This will of course depend on the width 
of the aisle and the number of orders picked per day. These trucks are also 
utilized to pick full pallets from the racking.
Low-level order pickers (LLOP) and towing tractors
Low-level order-picking trucks are electrically powered and have the facility of 
moving two pallets or up to three roll cages at a time along picking aisles. 
These trucks are able to operate at first and second levels with the operator 
being lifted upwards on a platform as can be seen in Figure 5.11.
The towing tractors are ideal for horizontal transport and low-level order 
picking. These can move or ‘tram’ multiple pallets and cages, long distances 
from the reserve storage and picking areas to despatch. See Figure 5.12.
High-level order pickers (HLOP)
In operations where there is a high number of product lines and insufficient 
floor space to provide enough pallet pick faces, there is a requirement to pick 
from the storage slots that are high above ground level. In these circumstances 
we need to operate high-level order pickers as shown in Figure 5.13.
The advantages of this system are that we end up with a high density of pick 
faces by utilizing narrow aisle racking and trucks; it can also eliminate replenish-
ment if a random storage system is utilized.

However, disadvantages include a much slower retrieval process (<  30 picks 
per hour) and a potential for bottlenecks in the aisles, together with the 
inflexibility of narrow aisle racking. Other issues include the requirement for 
harnesses for staff (in the United States) and the ergonomic issues of reaching 
to the far side of a pallet to retrieve stock.
The system is mainly suited for operations with a large number of slow-
moving items and low numbers of lines per order.
A recent entry into the market is an articulated forklift truck with the ability 
to lift the operator up to 6 metres. This truck, introduced by Translift Bendi, 
has the ability to not only put-away, retrieve and replenish full pallets but is 
also able to pick product from level three in the racking. The truck has the 
ability to work in 1.8-metre aisles and can put-away pallets up to 12 metres. 
Whilst most picking operations are carried out with great efficiency, there 
remains a sticking point when an order picker, picking at ground level reaches 
an empty pallet location. The operator will put out a call for the replenishment 
truck to get another full pallet of stock, which interrupts the picking process 
and causes unnecessary delays or missed picks that are both a waste of space and 
time – both of which cost money. It was here that the idea for an articulated 
order picking truck was born.

Conveyors
Conveyors carry goods by power or gravity. They are an integral part of zone 
picking and goods-to-picker systems as they transfer cartons and totes between 
zones and to the operator workstations.
Powered conveyors tend to be used for transferring goods over longer 
distances and utilize belts, chains, slats and rollers.
Gravity conveyors can be used to transfer picked items from a mezzanine 
floor to the despatch area for consolidation with other picked items or along 
short distances within zones.
Conveyors can have non-powered or powered rollers or belts. The latter tend 
to be less expensive than powered rollers and have the advantage of being able 
to move all types of boxes and bags without fear of jamming up the conveyor.
The disadvantages of conveyor systems include high capital cost, less flex-
ibility, regular maintenance requirements and they are an obstruction to both 
pedestrians and trucks.
Sortation systems
In situations where there is a high degree of commonality in terms of orders 
with a known number of delivery locations such as retail stores, a pick to belt 
system can be used effectively. Here products are picked in bulk using the batch 
picking method and the items are placed on a conveyor belt. As each item 
passes a barcode reader it is identified and diverted to a particular location on 
route. The items can either drop into a bin or slide down a chute. Here the 
items are consolidated and packed into a shipping carton, a cage or loaded

directly onto a vehicle. Examples are cross belt, narrow belt, bomb bay and tilt 
tray sorters. Productivity can range from 6,000 to 20,000 units per hour.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3U5ihEJALo
Storage equipment 
The type of storage equipment utilized within the warehouse for pick opera-
tions will vary substantially depending on the type and size of product, the 
throughput envisaged and available capital.
We also have to take into account the requirement for reserve storage and 
how product is transferred from the reserve storage area to the pick face; this 
is termed replenishment.
Floor/bulk storage
In situations where capital is at a premium and goods are of a low value with 
very few SKUs, the use of the floor area for storage and picking is totally 
acceptable.
The disadvantages, however, are the low utilization of the cubic capacity 
of the building, operators having to bend down to pick from the floor and the 
inability to replace picked pallets without compromising the FIFO rule. This 
leads to what is commonly termed the ‘honeycomb effect’.
Standard and narrow aisle pallet racking
Definitions in this area can be rather confusing. In these examples we see wide 
aisle racking as being used in conjunction with counterbalance trucks or reach 
trucks, narrow aisle with reach trucks and very narrow aisle racking with very 
narrow aisle trucks, articulated forklift trucks and cranes.
Standard or wide aisle (>  3.5 m – 4 m) and narrow aisle (≥  2.5 m) adjustable 
pallet racking (APR) is used to provide ground-floor pick locations and reserve 
storage for full-carton picks. The racking can also be used with high-level order 
picking trucks if there are insufficient ground-floor pick locations.
Pallet locations can also be reduced in height through the use of steel, wooden 
or mesh decking and can also be segmented into bins providing less than full pallet 
locations and enabling companies to have more SKU in a smaller cubic space.
There are issues with picking in racked areas. One is the fact that having  
a 1,000 mm or 1,200 mm deep location makes it more difficult to pick as the 
operator has to stretch in to pick the cartons. There is the potential issue of 
trucks and people operating in the same aisle at the same time and finally there 

Picking Strategies and Equipment
125
is the possibility of congestion at the pick face with a number of operators 
arriving at the pick face at the same time.
Very narrow aisle pallet racking (≥  1.6–1.8 m) metres
This racking can be utilized for the storage of reserve pallets and for pick 
operations. There are a number of issues to bear in mind, however, if picking 
from this area. Along with similar challenges to those mentioned above there 
is also the issue of rail guided narrow aisle trucks which preclude the use of 
pallet trucks or pallet jacks to manoeuvre pallets in and out of the pick locations 
within the racking. This makes picking much more difficult and less productive. 
Some countries require aisles to be wide enough to allow staff to be able to 
pass between the trucks and the racking safely. Another safety concern is when 
narrow aisle truck operators are high up in the racking it is more difficult to see 
the pickers at ground floor level.
The use of automatic cranes in very narrow aisle racked areas precludes 
the picking of individual cartons. Full-pallet, single-SKU picks are however 
undertaken.
Carton flow racking
Carton live storage operates by means of gravity-fed rollers on adjustable 
shelving. Cartons are loaded at the upper end of sloping lanes, in the rear aisle 
and move down under the force of gravity when a carton is removed from the 
picking face. The rollers can be adjusted to take different sizes of cartons and 
can also be fitted with a braking system to protect the more fragile items.
As can be seen by comparing Table 5.1 and Figure 5.16, the occupancy rate 
is high, travel time is reduced and the system is fully FIFO compliant.

If space is an issue, and a second aisle cannot be accommodated, companies 
can use a push-back system, which loads from the front as opposed to the rear. 
However, this will mean a last in, first out (LIFO) as opposed to first in, first out 
(FIFO) system of stock control.
Full pallets of stock can be stored above the carton live storage, thus utilizing 
the cube of the area.
Shelving
Shelving is used to store less than pallet quantities of product. The items can be 
stored in their original cartons or in totes or bins. There are many different 
types of shelving, most of which are adjustable with different widths and 
heights.
Bin or tote storage makes it possible to present a large variety of items on 
a very compact face. These bins or containers are of different sizes, colours and 
shapes, and most have semi-open fronts.
Static shelving is reasonably inexpensive. The hidden cost, according to 
Cisco Eagle, is the cost of labour: the amount of time operators spend picking 
and restocking. Cisco Eagle reports that pickers spend only 15 per cent of their 
time doing productive work using static shelving. By using gravity-flow shelving, 
pickers are a lot more productive.

Gravity-flow shelving does cost more than static shelving; however, this is more 
than made up for by the labour cost savings. Travel time is reduced significantly, 
as is the time spent locating and replenishing products.
Gravity-flow racking uses floor space more efficiently. Fewer aisles are required 
and more product can be stored in the same amount of floor space, as shown 
in Table 5.1. This system can also be retro-fitted into existing racking. One area 
to take into account is the length of run for gravity shelving. Too long a run can 
result in wasted space as each lane can only hold one product line. The option 
is to have one product line across a number of lanes rather than have a long 
run. Two further points to bear in mind are the need for ongoing maintenance 
for the rollers and secondly the fact that different products will have different 
weights and will require different inclines to propel them down to the front.
An alternative to shelving are bin drawers, which provide greater security 
and high-density storage.
Mobile shelving and racking
Where space is at a premium and access to items is intermittent, as in the case 
of archive material and very slow-moving items, mobile shelving and racking, 
which runs on guides or rails and is either manually operated or powered, is a 
potential alternative to static shelving.
Access to each run of shelving is gained by either turning a wheel at the end 
of the run or by accessing it electronically at the touch of a button. This type of 
racking can be utilized in cold-store operations – for long-duration product – 
where its use can effectively eliminate aisles that otherwise have to be cooled.

Carousels
Carousels are designed for medium- to high-throughput environments. They 
are also ideal for small, high-value items. There are two types of carousel: 
horizontal and vertical.
Horizontal carousels
Horizontal carousels work on a similar principle to a merry-go-round. The 
carousel can be made up of shelves, bins or garment holders. These rotate 
and are controlled by an operator who uses a computer keypad to type in the 
location, product code or order number, depending on how the software has 
been set up. If an order number is keyed in, the carousel will stop at the operator 
station in pick sequence.

Picking Strategies and Equipment
129
An operator may look after more than one carousel (pods) in order to limit 
the amount of down time waiting for each carousel to rotate. Goods-to-operator 
systems are designed to keep the operator working as much as possible and 
reduce the amount of travel time.
Horizontal carousels vary significantly in length depending on the nature of 
the product to be stored. They can also range in height from 2 to 8 metres, 
necessitating the use of a platform to access the product or the introduction of 
automatic extractors.
Horizontal carousels are ideal for storing and picking high numbers of SKU, 
small individual items, medium to large cartons and products including hanging 
garments. They are especially effective in low-headroom areas.
According to OPS (2009) a multiple pod (three or more) can be used to pick 
between 200 and 400 lines per hour.
Horizontal carousels are expensive and are limited by the amount of time 
they take to rotate. Cubic space utilization can also be an issue, as can safety if 
the carousel is not enclosed. It is difficult to replenish when picking and they 
are limited in terms of the number of operators. They are also very system 
driven.

130
Vertical carousels 
Vertical carousels are enclosures which have shelves that rotate in either 
direction similar to a Ferris or big wheel at a fun fair, bringing a requested 
item to the operator at a suitable working height. They allow you to use the 
maximum height available within the building, providing the best use of 
space within a very small footprint. Vertical carousels are ideal for small- to 
medium-size parts. The carousel takes up a much smaller footprint than a 
horizontal carousel. The shelving can be adjusted and sub-divided to handle 
different sizes and weights.
Vertical carousels provide added security. However, their effectiveness is 
tempered by the speed of movement. Here the trade-off is between the height 
of the system and therefore its greater storage capacity and the length of time 
it takes the shelves to rotate.
Some carousels will operate with a lift system as opposed to rotating shelves. 
These can handle heavier items.
The software provided with vertical carousels can manage the stock within 
the carousel, pick in sequence, work with pick-to-light systems and provide 
accurate reporting. The system can also work with scanners to confirm the 
correct item is picked every time.
In both examples operators may look after more than one carousel, thus 
reducing downtime. Vertical carousels can also operate with two or more 
openings so that staff at different levels can access the parts stored.
Pick rates vary from 100 to 300 lines per hour. As in the horizontal carousel 
it requires ongoing maintenance and is very system reliant.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ty1gxxAv9U
Vertical lift module (VLM)
Similar to a vertical carousel a VLM is an enclosed storage system consisting 
of two columns of extractable ‘trays’ each able to hold multiple cartons, totes 
or bins. A computer-controlled insertion/extraction device between the two 
columns automatically locates and retrieves the tray containing the item to be 
picked. Trays are delivered to an access window for the picker. A pick-to-light 
system will normally indicate the quantity and the item to be picked, whilst 
slotting software controls the location and number and size of items per tray. 
As with the VC multiple VLMs or pods reduce the amount of dwell time by the 
operator. (OPS/WERC 2009)

Picking Strategies and Equipment
131
A-frames
These machines are similar to vending machines but on a much bigger scale. 
They are ideal for high-volume items of uniform size and weight. This sorting 
and picking equipment operates most efficiently in an environment where these 
two characteristics are present. Typical products include CDs, DVDs, cosmetics 
and pharmaceuticals.
The products are placed in magazines on a frame resembling a letter A and 
are automatically dispensed via a computer controlled trigger system into a 
tote or directly onto a conveyor as it passes through the tunnel created by the 
frame. A section of the conveyor is allocated to each order. As the order reaches 
the end of the A-frame it drops into a tote or carton and is then conveyed via 
conveyor to another picking area if the order is incomplete or to the packing

area. While the machine is operating, manual replenishment activities can be 
performed with no impact on the dispensing operations.
A-frame systems are capable of filling orders quickly: up to 750,000 units per 
day, 3,000 lines per hour, depending on capacity and the replenishment cap­
ability. They can be highly accurate, with operations recording over 99.95 per 
cent accuracy.
However, this system does require manual replenishment and inaccuracies 
can occur when filling the channels.

Summary and conclusion
There are many different picking strategies that can be utilized within a ware-
house operation. Each one will depend on the nature of the product, the 
velocity of throughput and the company budget.
Picker-to-goods strategies remain the most utilized method within today’s 
warehouse operations. However, goods-to-picker methods are gaining ground 
as automation becomes more sophisticated and also more affordable.
It is likely that multiple strategies will be used in today’s warehouses as they 
look to cope with multichannel distribution requirements.
Figure 5.20 provides some guidelines to the type of picking and storage 
equipment to use, based on product size, number of orders, speed of through-
put and size of inventory.
Table 5.2 provides a comparison between the different picking strategies.

Order-picking 
methods
Fast is fine but accuracy is everything.
(Wyatt Earp (1848–1929))
Introduction
This is the area in which advances in technology have transformed the picking 
operation and improved accuracy and productivity significantly. The intro-
duction of barcoding, voice technology and pick-by-light systems is not only 
improving warehouse picking operations but also producing an acceptable 
return on investment.
The following picking methods are currently in use in today’s warehouses:
●
●paper pick lists;
●
●pick by label;
●
●pick by voice;
●
●barcode scanning;
●
●radio frequency identification;
●
●pick by light/pick to light;
●
●put to light;
●
●automated picking.
Paper pick lists
A paper pick list will normally detail the order number, location, product code, 
description and quantity to be picked. If utilizing a WMS, each product line 
will be shown in sequence, enabling the picker to travel the most efficient way 
around the warehouse and ending up as close to the despatch bay as possible.

Order-picking Methods
139
The operator is however at liberty to choose a different route if it is felt that 
it is more direct. The fastest-moving items should be placed close to the des-
patch area to minimize travel. Stock control systems and manual applications 
may not have this ability and therefore some form of manual intervention is 
required to reduce the amount of pick travel undertaken.
The picker will utilize a trolley, cage, pallet truck or possibly a forklift truck. 
The advantage of using a forklift truck is that the pallet can be lifted to a suit-
able height as the picker continues along the route.
Any discrepancies are written onto the pick list. When the pick list is returned 
to the supervisor, the discrepancies should be checked immediately and alter­
native locations provided if there are shortages. Details of the pick are entered 
manually into the system. This can lead to errors if the writing is illegible or 
there is confusion over the way a number is written. This all adds time to the 
operation. Paper picking requires little investment; however, it can have low 
accuracy and may require order validation.
Once an order has been picked the operator has to return to the office for 
further pick lists or instructions. It is not a real-time system.
Pick by label
In this system, pick lists are a series of labels on a sheet, which are printed in 
pick order. The picker attaches a label to each item picked and returns any 
unused labels to the supervisor’s office. Any discrepancies are checked imme­
diately and additional labels printed if the stock is available elsewhere in the 
warehouse. This can eliminate a step at the despatch area as address labels are 
already attached. It’s also more accurate than paper picking as you can soon 
tell if there has been a mis-pick in terms of quantity.
These are both very manual operations and rely on the operator, supervisor 
and administration clerk all playing their part to ensure accurate information 
is recorded.
These manual forms of operation and low levels of productivity and accuracy 
have led to an increase in the use of technology within the warehouse.
Pick by voice
The use of voice technology is gaining ground in warehouses globally, particularly 
for order picking, although other processes such as cycle counting, put-away 
and replenishment also utilize the system. Many companies are moving directly 
from paper picking to voice and bypassing barcode scanning.

Warehouse Management

Operators are issued with a headset and a microphone together with a small 
terminal that is attached to a belt or can be worn on the wrist. The WMS sends 
messages to the computer via radio frequency (RF) transmissions, utilizing 
transmitters installed throughout the warehouse, and these messages are 
converted into voice commands. The operator also uses voice to communicate 
back to the system.
Voice was first employed about 20 years ago for cold-storage applications 
where gloves and extreme temperatures made it difficult to use scanners and 
paper based systems.
The list of benefits are stated as being very comprehensive. They include:
●
●increased accuracy;
●
●increased productivity;
●
●reduction in paper usage;
●
●reduction in errors through elimination of re-keying data;
●
●improved safety through hands- and eyes-free operation;
●
●reduction in damage;
●
●real-time stock updates leading to fast and accurate replenishment;
●
●real-time updates regarding potential shortages;
●
●increased operator time on the warehouse floor;
●
●reduced training times;
●
●multilingual, accommodating a diverse workforce;
●
●easy to integrate with other systems;
●
●potential reduction in employee turnover; and
●
●normally a quick ROI.
In a survey by ARC Advisory Group and Modern Materials Handling magazine, 
nearly 60 per cent of respondents saw productivity gains greater than 8 per cent 
in their picking operations when they adopted voice, whilst another 26 per cent 
saw productivity gains of between 4 and 8 per cent.
More than 83 per cent of the companies who had implemented voice reported 
that their investment had met their financial hurdle goals.

Figure 6.1 shows other benefits identified by the survey.
This system has become prevalent in the food service and grocery retail 
sector. It is particularly suitable for both chilled and frozen environments where 

Order-picking Methods
141
gloves hamper the use of radio data terminals (RDTs) and paper, whilst the 
hands-free aspect of the system has major advantages over paper pick lists, 
labels and barcode scanning.
Increased accuracy can negate the need for additional checks at despatch. 
The reduction in picking errors is significant in most of the companies who 
have adopted this technology. Some companies have, however, introduced a 
failsafe by scanning the item once picked.
For high-volume operations, even small improvements in accuracy can pro-
duce a substantial payback. For example, a warehouse that picks half a million 
cases per week with a 99.8 per cent accuracy level (two errors per thousand) 
incurs 52,000 errors per annum. Increasing accuracy to 99.96 per cent or  
0.4 per thousand, for example, will reduce errors by 41,600 per annum.
If we accept that the cost of a mis-pick is approximately £25 ($39), this can 
be an overall saving of £1,040,000. ($1,627,000)
When UK retailer Waitrose introduced voice into its picking operation it 
recorded an increase in accuracy from 98.68 per cent to 98.88 per cent based 
on sample audits.
Companies that have invested in voice systems are seeing increases in accu-
racy rates of up to 99.9 per cent and a number are recording reduced staff 
turnover and training time.
Perhaps most importantly, voice solutions demonstrate direct benefits to the 
bottom line: payback is typically less than one year. This can be achieved 
through accuracy alone.
As can be seen in Figure 6.2, voice can eliminate a number of steps in the 
pick process, leading to increased productivity and accuracy.

CASE STUDY 
Waitrose
Waitrose was founded in London in 1904. It has since been acquired by the John 
Lewis Partnership, who opened the first Waitrose supermarket in 1955. Today there 
are 280 branches, dedicated to offering quality, value and customer service.
Waitrose combines the convenience of a supermarket with the expertise and 
service of a specialist shop.
Locations range from high streets to edge-of-town sites and vary in size from just 
7,000 square feet to approximately 56,000 square feet.
Waitrose services its stores from four regional distribution centres across four 
sites at Bracknell, Aylesford, Leyland and Brinklow. Having recognized potential 
productivity improvements through the use of voice technology, the Waitrose supply 
chain team decided to research the technology by visiting other UK retailers and 
testing different systems.
Prior to the introduction of voice-picking technology, Waitrose operated with a 
variety of picking methods including pick sheets, pick labels and RDTs.
Having chosen a supplier, the team introduced voice for the pick operations only, 
although there are plans to utilize voice for other operations in the warehouse in future. 
The implementation began at Bracknell and was subsequently rolled out to the other 
sites. The fresh foods department was excluded from this implementation phase.
One reason for the partial implementation was the fact that the existing WMS was 
a bespoke system, didn’t operate in real time and therefore would have required 
greater functionality to be written into the voice software system.
Waitrose utilized their productivity systems team to measure productivities within 
each department prior to the implementation to enable them to compare the different 
methods of picking.
The voice-picking operation was measured after a three-month settling-in period.
In order to introduce voice technology, a business case was produced which, 
based on discussions with other companies who had introduced voice, predicted a 
7.5 per cent increase in productivity.
Having operated the technology across a number of sites and for a reasonable 
period of time, Waitrose has calculated that the overall productivity improvement is 
on average 8 per cent. As the staff become more experienced, the productivity rate 
is likely to improve further. Staff are also able to monitor their own productivity 
through the voice system in terms of cases picked per hour, for example.
In terms of pick accuracy, independent auditors recorded an increase from 98.68 per 
cent to 98.88 per cent accuracy based on sample audits. The system only operates 
with check digits for the location and doesn’t include product confirmation. There is 
pressure therefore on the put-away team to ensure accurate placement.

Warehouse Management
144
The team at Waitrose has been very happy with the implementation to date even 
though the process didn’t run smoothly throughout.
When considering the introduction of voice technology, the Waitrose team came 
up with a list of Dos and Don’ts as follows:
Do:
●
●visit other operations to assess impact of introduction;
●
●work in partnership with these companies where possible;
●
●get a full understanding of the potential technology issues;
●
●ensure sufficient RF coverage throughout the warehouse;
●
●ensure the management team fully understands the benefits and has a full 
understanding of the system;
●
●consult and gain full acceptance from your staff;
●
●explain fully the advantages of voice and allay fears regarding safety and any 
‘Big Brother’ issues;
●
●appoint super users to respond to and react quickly to issues;
●
●ensure training standards and procedures are maintained at a high level;
●
●provide choice to the users in terms of headsets and voices;
●
●provide opportunities for staff feedback;
●
●measure productivities before and after implementation and ongoing;
●
●continually assess and review the processes.
Don’t:
●
●think it’s easy to implement and manage;
●
●assume staff will accept it unconditionally;
●
●implement other systems at the same time.
The main advantages to date include:
●
●improved health and safety as a result of the hands-free operation;
●
●a safer working environment as staff are able to concentrate fully on the job in 
hand;
●
●improved productivity;
●
●greater accuracy;
●
●quicker staff training compared with paper- and RDT-based picking;
●
●ability to use many nationalities in the same operation.

Order-picking Methods
145
The Waitrose case study shows an initial average productivity improvement of 
8 per cent across all the operations.
In order to calculate the benefits you need to measure productivity levels 
before and after implementation.
Increases in productivity can be measured in terms of the average cases per 
hour picked by each worker. Take the cases picked per day divided by hours per 
day worked (eg 7.5 actual hours) divided by number of pickers (in this case 35):
36,000 cases ÷ 7.5 hours per day ÷ 35 operators = 137 cases 
per hour per operator. A 10 per cent productivity gain would raise the cases per 
hour to 151.
To calculate the reduction in operators, take the same equation and solve for 
X as the number of operators:
36,000 cases ÷ 7.5 hours per day ÷ (x) operators = 151 OR  
× = 36,000 ÷ 7.5 ÷ 151 = 32 operators
In this example that means three fewer operators are needed with the switch to 
voice-directed selection based on a 10 per cent improvement in productivity.
Further savings can be made in terms of stationery, the labour involved in 
administrative tasks, the training of personnel, improved safety, reduced sickness 
levels and potential compensation claims and quicker, more accurate stock checks.
Time to full productivity for a new worker using scanning methods is typi-
cally two to three weeks; with voice it can be as little as three to four days.
In terms of expected return on investment, this will vary significantly from 
company to company. It will depend on:
●
●the current level of productivity and scope for improvement;
●
●the current method of picking;
●
●the amount of checking within the system;
●
●the number of picking shifts within the system;
●
●the current level of RF infrastructure; and
●
●whether the WMS can support voice.
Voice on its own may not work in all environments. Where companies require 
the capture of data such as serial numbers or batch codes, voice needs to be 
supplemented by some form of scanning or image-capture technology.
Voice technology, unless used in conjunction with scanning, may not be 100 per 
cent accurate. It does rely on the correct product being in the right location. 
Some companies have supplemented voice confirmation of quantity with prod-
uct recognition by repeating the last four digits of the barcode, for example.

Warehouse Management
146
Even if hands-free picking is a requirement there are other systems on the 
market that can be as appropriate, if not more so.
Overall, voice technology can provide a reasonable return on investment by 
improving accuracy, increasing productivity and improving ergonomics, thus 
reducing staff illness and, as a consequence, improving customer service.
Taking things a step further, a number of manufacturers have introduced 
a combined voice and automated guided vehicle (AGV) or laser-guided forklift 
truck system.
The AGVs feature a laser navigation steering system which charts the picker’s 
route. At the first location the voice system instructs the picker as to which item 
should be loaded onto the empty pallet. The picker informs the system as to 
what has been picked and loaded and the truck continues to the next location 
without the operator having to control it.
Once the truck is fully loaded it transfers to the loading bay while the picker 
moves on to the next order, arriving at the first location where another AGV 
with an empty pallet has just arrived. See Figure 6.3.
By implementing both systems simultaneously, the Swedish Co-op reported 
that it had improved productivity by up to 70 per cent.
Barcode scanning
A barcode consists of a series of vertical bars of varying widths that represent 
letters, numbers and other symbols. Barcodes are used to identify products, 
locations in the warehouse, containers (totes, cartons, pallets), serial and batch 
numbers.

As with many areas of logistics, there is no conformity and thus no universal 
barcode. This can make it difficult to transfer products between companies and 
countries. The main barcode standards include EAN-8, EAN-13 and Code 128. 
Appendix 2 has a comprehensive guide to all the barcode options.
Recent developments include two-dimensional barcodes, the advantage 
being that you can store a greater amount of data within a much smaller space. 
See Figure 6.4.
A current debate is whether the pharmaceutical industry should be investing 
in 2D technology or radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Both are able 
to hold more information than a standard linear barcode; however, certain 
types of RFID tags are rewritable. Currently there is a significant difference in 
price between barcodes and RFID tags.
Barcode readers come in many different forms. They can be hand held, 
static, truck-mounted or wearable.
The hand-held scanner has a screen and a trigger. It scans the barcode, deci-
phers it and stores or transmits it to a computer. These scanners have the ability 
to read a number of different types of barcode, although this will depend on the 
manufacturer, model and cost. Some PDAs and mobile phones also have scanners 
and cameras able to read one-dimensional and two-dimensional barcodes.
Data can be read, stored in the scanner and then downloaded by attaching 
the scanner to the computer via a USB connection. Information can also be 
transferred in real time via RF.
A pen or wand scanner swipes the barcode through contact and reads and 
deciphers the information.
Barcode scanning, utilizing hand-held scanners with real-time data trans-
mission has made data collection faster and more accurate in today’s warehouse 
environment. It has also increased productivity by ensuring that operators 
don’t have to return to the office for instructions each time they complete a 
task. The instructions are on screen in the form of text which the operator 
scrolls through and advances by choosing specific commands.
However, barcode scanning with hand-held devices does have drawbacks. 
These include having to set down the reader whilst tasks are carried out or 
struggling to hold the unit and carry out the task at the same time. Errors tend 
to occur when using hand-held scanners if they are holstered or put down on a 
surface. This movement can cause the picker to pick from the wrong location

or miscount the items. There is potential for greater damage if scanners are 
dropped or mishandled. Safety is also an issue as operators try to read the 
instructions whilst in motion.
A stationary scanner will read the barcode as it passes by on a conveyor, 
for example. This requires the barcode to be easily visible, intact and in a 
uniform position on the item. Static readers tend to be used with belt sorters 
and conveyors for example.
Recent advances in this area include the introduction of hands-free, wear­
able computers that enable the operator to handle product with both hands as 
opposed to having to hold a barcode scanner, paper pick list or roll of labels.
A wireless-enabled, wearable computer allows operators to receive instruc-
tions in real time, scan barcodes, enter data and transmit in real time. Wearable 
computers are typically worn on the wrist or lower arm and feature a screen and 
a small keyboard or touch screen, with the option of a finger-mounted scanner 
that either plugs into the unit or communicates via Bluetooth technology. These 
have gained in popularity within warehouses where heavy items require both 
hands free to execute a task.
Companies choose wearable solutions for a variety of reasons. Wearable 
computers require very little change to existing warehouse operations that 
currently use hand-held computers.
Wearable computers also require little re-training of staff and usually no soft-
ware modification. The existing applications designed for hand-held or forklift-
mounted units can usually run on a wearable device with no modification.
Workers simply need to adjust to putting the wearable components on, 
to the feel of the computer on their wrist, and if chosen, to the use of a ring 
scanner. Today’s wearable units typically weigh just a few ounces, so fatigue and 
comfort are typically not an issue. Power is usually supplied from a battery 
pack worn on the arm or at the small of the back. See Figure 6.5.
By using wearable computers, one task is eliminated, thus making the pick 
process quicker and potentially reducing errors. Productivity and accuracy 
improvements can quickly add up to substantial savings.
To put things into context, imagine a warehouse with 20 order pickers, that 
pick 100 cases per hour (based on an eight-hour day, 253 days per annum).  
An accuracy rate of 99.5 per cent incurs 20,240 errors per annum. An increase in 
accuracy to 99.8 per cent reduces the errors to 8,096 errors. If each error costs 
a conservative £25 ($39) that amounts to an annual saving of £303,600 ($475,000).
The computers can also be supplied with easy-to-read touch screens and 
two-dimensional imagers. They can be configured to be voice enabled, allowing 
pick operations to be even more accurate as items can be scanned to ensure the 
correct item has been picked from the location.
Other advantages include less damage to equipment and less strain on the 
user. Figure 6.6 shows an operator carrying both a scanner and a box. Not all

his fingers are around the box, making it more difficult to grip. This compares 
with the operator in Figure 6.7, who is using both hands to hold the box.
These systems are also providing benefits in other areas including improved 
customer service, decreased training time, a reduction in damages and accidents, 
increased employee satisfaction and increased compliance.
One of the main disadvantages of barcodes is their potential to be damaged, 
thus making reading difficult and/or potentially inaccurate.
A recent advance in hand-held units by companies such as Tecsys is visual 
logistics whereby instead of lines and lines of text operators are being presented 
with a visual warehouse location map to quickly guide them to the assigned 
pick location and a visual guide as to the exact carton or tote into which to put 
the selected products, eliminating the wasteful and time-consuming process of 
searching for the pick slot. They are also being presented with product-specific 
images to enable a visual validation and to ensure that the appropriate quality 
assurance checks are performed.

According to Tecsys the time to pick a product line can be reduced by up to 
30 seconds. Workers are empowered to access critical information to make 
faster decisions and accelerate their workflows, particularly in environments 
where literacy is an issue. It also reduces training time.
Radio frequency identification
RFID is a means of uniquely identifying an item using radio waves. Data is 
exchanged between tags and readers and depending on the frequency, may or 
may not require line of sight. Common uses in today’s world include library 
books, toll passes and access ID cards.
Its use in the supply chain has been limited until recently. However, high-
profile projects within the US military, Asda, Walmart and Tesco have increased 
awareness.
The system enables the simultaneous reading of multiple items as opposed 
to barcodes, which need to be read individually.
There are two types of RFID tags: those that are passive, have no power 
source, limited data storage capacity, are read only and have a limited read 
range, and those that are active, have their own power source, have a larger 
data-storage capacity, have a read/write capability and are readable from a 
greater distance.
Passive tags hold little actual data but are able to identify an item to a data-
base where more comprehensive data is stored. For example, a conveyor-based 
sortation system can identify the item and interrogate the database to receive 
routing instructions.
Active tags have a higher capacity and can have their item’s status updated 
once a task has been completed. They have a shorter writing range than reading 
range and the internal power source is likely to burn out within 5 to 10 years.
Frequency is an important factor in transmission range and speed and not 
all frequencies are available for use globally, which can cause issues from a supply 
chain perspective.
Individual-item-level tracking for the majority of products is unlikely to hap-
pen during the next 10 years or so due to the cost of implementation; however, 
unit-load identification is possible and potentially cost effective. The tracking 
of roll cages, pallets and returnable packaging such as totes, kegs, barrels and 
trays can be made simpler and cost effective through the use of RFID.
The difficulty faced by proponents of RFID is that barcodes are so cheap to 
produce and remain an accurate and cost-effective method of identification.
The cost of operating an RFID system will vary tremendously depending on 
the application, the size of installation, the frequencies used and the quantity of 
tags purchased. As take-up increases, the costs will reduce.

Warehouse Management
152
The following items are required to introduce an RFID application:
●
●RFID readers (from £300 to £1,500);
●
●RFID tags (from £0.05 to £0.10 upwards depending on the frequency 
and method of application to the item);
●
●middleware;
●
●systems upgrades; and
●
●RF network within the warehouse.
Current disadvantages of RFID include:
●
●reading issues when in close proximity to liquids and metal;
●
●dead areas in the warehouse where signals are weak;
●
●tags can be damaged by liquids, static discharges and magnetic  
surges; and
●
●intermittent data capture, with the possibility of some tags not  
being read.
Pick by light/pick to light
Light travels at a speed of 186,000 miles per second (299,792,458 metres per 
second) whereas sound travels at 0.2 miles per second (343 metres per second), 
therefore the human eye can see a light faster than it takes for the brain to 
interpret a voice command.
Pick to light or pick by light uses light-indicator, LED or LCD modules 
mounted to shelving, flow racks, pallet racks or other storage locations.
This system tends to be used in conjunction with zone picking.
To begin the process an operator scans a barcode on an arriving pick tote or 
shipping carton which denotes the next order number to be picked. This com-
municates to the system that the operator is ready to pick. The system then 
sends a message to the zone in which the operator is stationed and all the pick 
locations for that particular order light up at once.
A digital display tells the operator the quantity to pick; once this has been 
picked the operator turns the light off to confirm the pick. The operator can 
then move on to the next location indicated. The pickers continue until the pick 
in their area is completed. Some systems allow the operator to scan the item 
before placing it in the shipping carton to ensure accuracy. This does however 
slow down the process but is a check on the accuracy of the put-away process. 
Other systems provide an image of the product to be picked to increase accuracy. 
The tote is then passed to the next zone for the rest of the order to be picked. 
This is a typical pick-and-pass method of picking.

Order-picking Methods
153
All information is exchanged in real time with the enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) or WMS system.
Unlike scanning and voice picking, which are sequential in nature, all locations 
are indicated to the operator at the same time. This means that the operator 
can choose the best pick path.
Pick by light necessitates operators being stationed in zones looking after a 
certain quantity of SKUs. The order tote moves between zones on a conveyor, 
cart or other transportation method.
As operators are based in a specific area, this reduces the amount of walking 
required within the warehouse.
At the end of the pick an operator will check the order number, possibly 
check the weight of the consignment, attach an address label, add the delivery 
documentation and signify the carrier if multiple carriers are used.
By getting the operator to the right location each time, the picking process 
is greatly improved and productivity increased. Training is relatively simple 
and is conducive to the use of temporary labour and seasonal employees. Some 
companies have introduced portable pick-by-light systems that can be moved 
around the warehouse as required or to a temporary warehouse to cover peaks 
in business.
As with voice, there is very little upheaval when implementing the system. 
The lights can be retro fitted onto shelving and racking. The system can also be 
used in conjunction with carousels.
In terms of systems integration, pick to light is relatively simple. It requires 
the downloading of a file with the order number, product codes, locations and 
quantities. It can easily deal with part cases and individual items.
A further enhancement of the pick-to-light system is the SpeasTech system 
where indicator lights are automatically deactivated by the motion of the pick-
er’s hand through an infrared window in and out of the bin. One less step is 
required of each pick, so pickers can work faster. And if a hand reaches into the 
wrong bin, an audible alarm is sounded.

CASE STUDY 
SSI Schäfer and Yankee Candle
Picking efficiency has improved by 50 per cent and picking errors have significantly 
reduced at Yankee Candle’s European distribution centre in Bristol as a result of SSI

consumer via the internet. They wanted to improve overall picking accuracy and 
efficiency by building upon the existing KDR (push-through conduit shelving) flow-
racking system previously installed by SSI Schäfer.
The original KDR flow racking, designed to hold forward-picking stock in over 
1,800 locations, is divided into pick zones in a U-shaped layout with a conveyor running 
through the centre. Originally supporting paper-based picking, the KDR flow racking 
has been significantly enhanced by the addition of SSI Schäfer’s pick-to-light system.
Yankee Candle is already reaping the benefits of the new paperless system which 
uses the latest in Schäfer’s software technology by providing the advantage of 
flexible zone picking to balance out workload, contributing to increased picking 
efficiency, meaning fewer labour hours and reduced picking errors, resulting in fewer 
missed or low-level product shipments.
Mike Alibone, business development manager, SSI Schäfer, says: ‘As well as 
improving picking efficiency the system is designed to provide enhanced volumetric 
packing, multiple order consolidation, order progress optimization and shipping detail 
transfer to third-party carriers, taking Yankee Candle to a new level in operational 
excellence.’
Bruce Mitchell, operations manager at Yankee Candle, is delighted with the new 
system. He says: ‘The system has lifted picking efficiency by 50 per cent whilst 
significantly increasing the accuracy of the pick. In fact, shipping volumes are up by 
more than 40 per cent on this time last year while the number of errors is down by 
over 50 per cent of last year’s figure.’
In terms of packing, the system calculates the sizes and number of cartons 
required and prints labels in advance with the content. The system is reliant on using 
a database of carton volumetrics/packing parameters and is enabled when the 
operator scans the barcode on the carton label. Multiple orders can be consolidated 
for a single shipment to a customer.
For order progress optimization, all defined pick zones are able to commence 
order picking simultaneously, even when a single large order is split across different 
zones. It relies on operators in each zone picking in the printing sequence of the 
labels, which have been issued to synchronize order progression. For each pick 
wave the system looks at the distribution of the picks and calculates a zone size for 
each operator to work in, thereby spreading the number of picks evenly across a 
maximum of 12 operators.
Shipping detail transfer to third-party carriers allows cartons to be scanned and 
the details of the shipment to be transferred electronically via an interface between 
the SSI Schäfer system to any one of five carrier systems in order for the latter to 
generate their own despatch documentation.
Having installed the original, highly customized ‘flexible zone’ pick-to-light system, 
to improve picking efficiency and reduce picking errors, SSI Schaefer were 
contracted back in to support and work with Yankee Candle® Europe in their move

to a new 175,000 square foot warehouse ensuring the necessary alterations and 
extension to the system within the new site.
In just one month, SSI Schaefer dismantled the existing zone picking system made 
up of carton live storage, pick-by-light picking and conveyor-based carton sortation, 
transported it to the new DC and reinstalled it in conjunction with a complete 
reconfiguration and extension. At 175,000 square feet, this new DC is almost three 
times the size of the old facility and the addition of extra pallet positions has 
significantly increased storage capacity.
There are now more picking locations in the carton live storage, an additional full-
case ‘pick to belt conveyor’, additional ‘sort-to-route’ sortation lanes for completed 
orders and separate shipping carton feeds from two zone picking areas. The whole 
system has also been given a complete software overhaul including additional 
interfaces to contract carriers’ systems.
The extended automated system, which includes additional sortation capability 
and a new automated full-case picking area, has and will enable Yankee Candle® 
Europe to continue increasing its throughput efficiency of the picking operation and 
accommodate with ease, future requirements of its growing internet business.

Put to light
This system is particularly prevalent in retail store replenishment operations.
The WMS will consolidate all the store orders for a particular group of 
stores. This might be done by region or despatch times from the distribution 
centre (DC). The system needs to ensure that each group of stores has similar 
volumes where possible.
Depending on daily volumes, staff can increase or decrease the number of 
locations (stores) that they look after. Large-volume stores may be situated in 
a number of different zones with the totes/containers being consolidated at the 
despatch area.
Individual product lines required by the stores will be picked in bulk and 
transferred to the correct operator station by cart, pallet truck or via a con-
veyor. Each store will have a tote or totes assigned to it.
Once the SKU has arrived at the ‘put’ station the operator scans each item and 
a flashing light displays at each location indicating which containers (relating 
to a particular store) require that product and how many items are required.
Confirmed ‘put’ results are uploaded to the system in real time to update the 
WMS.
With pack-to-light or put-to-light systems there is a requirement to set up 
a central processing area, which can result in the design of a new layout and 
the introduction of further equipment.
In terms of systems, put-to-light technology requires order consolidation 
and a batch pick of products. Part pallets or cases will need to be returned to 
stock if stores do not order in complete cases or the total number of units 
ordered does not equate to full case quantities.
Pack or put to light can be more dynamic and works well with cross-dock 
operations where product can be received, allocated, picked and despatched on 
the same day if required.
One further note to add here, which is also relevant to other picking strategies, 
is the introduction by retailers of pick sequences that duplicate store layouts, 
enabling retail staff to replenish shelves efficiently.

CASE STUDY 
Put to light
A UK clothing retailer installed a put-to-light system at one of its DCs. Twenty stations 
were installed, each with a capacity of up to 24 stores. Product is automatically 
delivered to each station, utilizing an automated storage and retrieval system.
The light display at each location indicates how many items must be placed into 
each of the order totes, which means that a single operator can look after 24 store 
orders at the same time.
Once an order tote is full, the display instructs the operator to push the tote onto  
a conveyor system, which takes it to the despatch area.
The high-rate put stations (up to 1,000 items per hour, depending on order profile) 
significantly reduce the time taken by staff travelling between store orders.
Operators are fed with a continuous supply of products and each workstation is 
ergonomically designed.
A leading sporting goods manufacturer introduced a put-to-light system at a UK 
operation in 2008, investing over £20 million in the project. The company says: 
‘Automation allows us to handle a lot of volume in a relatively small amount of space, 
which keeps overheads down... automation allows us to flex the volume up and down 
accordingly. High-rate put stations enable operators to achieve an average of 500 
units per hour, with a potential capability of 1,500 picks per hour. With over 70,000 
SKUs the pick face for a manual operation would have been massive and given the 
seasonal nature of our business we would have been continually changing it – 
automation improves efficiency fivefold.’
Comparisons
Table 6.1 shows the various methods of picking utilized within today’s ware-
house. These show a combination of picker to goods and goods to picker. In 
section one we tend to have a single-pick operation where the picker collects 
all the items for a particular order and then takes it to despatch prior to picking 
the next order. Picks can be made from a floor-level pick face or, if there are 
significant numbers of SKUs and too few floor locations, from a higher-level 
pick face. In this situation the productivity reduces significantly as soon as the 
operator has to go up into the air.

In section two we have a two-stage process where product is picked in bulk, for 
example by batch, followed by a sortation process into individual orders. 
Although in two stages, the pick rates are reasonably high and it also includes 
a double check of items and quantities, thus improving accuracy. Put-to-light 
systems use batching to collect all the items for specific orders.
In section three we have the use of carousels, conveyors, flow racks and fully 
automated AS/RS systems.
Utilizing this form of picking, we see pick accuracy rates increasing together 
with the ability to handle large numbers of SKUs and items.
Table 6.2 provides a comparison between the different pick methods in 
terms of advantages and disadvantages.
Marc Wulfratt of MWPVL provides the following (Table 6.3) in terms of 
cost and accuracy comparisons. Costs are based on 2013 prices.
The costs are approximate and are based on a 100,000 square foot ware-
house with 25 operators and 2,500 SKU.
Cost of errors
It is an accepted fact that increased errors lead to increased costs.
There are many calculations for the cost of a mis-pick. The elements  
involved in an incorrect pick include:
●
●cost of recovering the item;
●
●labour cost of in-handling and checking the item on its return;
●
●cost of picking the replacement item;
●
●cost of re-packing;
●
●cost of re-delivery;
●
●administration costs of handling credit claims, etc;
●
●cash flow with reference to non-payment of invoice;
●
●potential loss of sale for the product incorrectly despatched;
●
●cost of re-training staff; and
●
●possible stock write-off if the returned product is outside an acceptable 
shelf life or has been damaged in transit.
In addition, if the error is an under-pick then it could result in a lost sale and 
the associated margin. If it’s an over-pick and is reported, there is the cost of 
transport to collect the item and labour costs as above or potentially a loss of 
margin in persuading the customer to keep the item. If not reported, the cost 
becomes the loss of the product and margin.

Estimations of the cost of mis-picks range from £25 to £40 with £25 being 
seen as a significant underestimation. This will, of course, depend on the type 
of product and market sector.
Deciding on type of picking system and 
equipment
This is quite a dilemma for warehouse managers today as they grapple with 
labour shortages and pressure to reduce costs yet increase accuracy, productivity 
and service levels.
The following factors must be taken into account before you make your 
final decision:
The return on investment and payback periods for major capital 
investments will greatly influence the decision as to whether or not to 
choose automation over more manual processes. A three- to five-year 
payback or better is considered a reasonable period when investing in 
warehouse operations.
Ergonomic and green issues are also playing their part in decision making 
within this arena. A greater concern over energy usage and potential 
taxation on environmentally unfriendly equipment is a factor that needs 
to be taken into account.

Warehouse Management
166
The long-term strategy of the company will have a bearing on the decision 
to invest in new equipment. Any potential relocation of the business, 
changes in product profile or distribution channel suggests that any 
investment in hard automation needs to be carefully considered. The 
dismantling and re-installation cost of this equipment is likely to be 
prohibitive.
High volume due to seasonal peaks such as the pre-Christmas period is not 
a signal to fully automate the processes. iForce, a UK-based fulfilment 
centre, has decided against large-scale investment in automation. In a 
recent article, ex-CEO Mark Hewitt said that peak issues may negate 
the use of technologies such as hand-held data terminals because it 
would mean a large number of units sitting redundant for the majority 
of the year.
The availability of labour is also a major factor in determining the level 
of automation. The availability of a large and stable workforce of 
skilled and non-skilled operators at reasonable wages enables you to be 
more flexible, saves on investment and improves cash flow significantly.
Flexibility and automation tend not to go hand in hand and therefore a 
thorough review of your pick operations and a discussion regarding future 
operations are paramount.
Computer simulations can assist in this review. Different types of pick 
operation can be evaluated and both soft and hard automation can be com-
pared quickly and without disrupting the existing operation.
Simulating different types of pick operation enables you to determine which 
one is best suited to the operation. It is cost effective and provides instant 
results.
By comparing picking solutions, such as pick to light and voice picking, for 
example, the simulation software is able to determine performance indicators 
such as operator pick rates and overall order throughput and, based on the 
results, suggest the most cost-effective method. Each of the scenarios is under-
taken in the risk-free environment of a computer screen.
Suppliers include Class, Logistics Simulation Ltd and many of the mechanical 
handling and equipment suppliers.
Finally it is not always a case of having one method per warehouse. Most 
companies will use a combination of pick technologies to further increase 
accuracy and productivity. A typical example is the use of voice technology 
together with finger scanning. This combines hands free picking with accurate 
data collection.

Order-picking Methods
167
Summary and conclusion
You should not under any circumstances automate a bad or broken process. 
Always ensure that your warehouse operation is working as efficiently as it can 
without the use of technology. It is only when you are at this stage that you 
should contemplate using technology to further enhance the operation. Processes 
need to be as streamlined as possible and any unnecessary steps eliminated.
Continuing to do what you’ve always done but more quickly and with less 
paper is not going to improve your overall performance.
There are a plethora of suppliers in this market and all are capable of assist-
ing you in making the right decision for your company. They want a sale but 
they also want a satisfied customer – take advantage of their expertise.
Finally, staff resistance to change is a potential barrier to the successful 
implementation of any new system and therefore all parties need to be on 
board before major decisions are taken.

Warehouse 
processes from 
replenishment 
to despatch and 
beyond
Introduction
In this chapter we examine the remaining processes within the warehouse. 
These include replenishment, value-adding services and despatch, together 
with the peripheral but essential tasks of stock counting and housekeeping.
We also look at security measures that can be taken within the warehouse.
Replenishment
In order to ensure a smooth and efficient picking process we need to ensure 
that the right products and quantities are in the correct pick location. This is 
replenishment.
As in the case of replenishing overall inventory to ensure customer satis-
faction, the warehouse also has to replenish its pick faces regularly to ensure 
picker satisfaction. An empty picking slot, just like an empty shelf location in 
store can mean a lost sale. The result of a poor replenishment process is order 
shortages, increased picking times and therefore increased cost per pick and an 
overall reduction in service level.
Real-time WMSs will recognize the need to replenish pick locations through 
real-time data transfer. These systems are also able to identify the total actual 
order quantities and therefore replenish before the next wave of orders arrive 
on the warehouse floor.

168

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
169
Other systems will rely on a trigger that denotes when the stock level 
within a pick face falls to a certain level. This will rely heavily on timing as 
orders that have generated pick lists may not actually have been picked and 
therefore replenishment has been triggered early. Late replenishment can result 
where staff have picked out of sequence, for example, and emptied the pick 
bays before the replenishment team have had an opportunity to top up the 
location.
Timing is crucial. An early instruction to replenish can cause as many pro­
blems as late replenishment, with potentially overfull pick faces and issues with 
FIFO.
If product can be moved directly to the pick face from the inbound section 
this cuts out a number of processes. This will require a certain amount of pre-
planning to ensure that pick faces are not overfilled. Pallets can be de-layered 
to correspond with expected pick quantities.
In the absence of a warehouse management system the warehouse manager 
will need to first ensure that the pick faces are designed to take the optimum 
quantity of product based on predicted sales per day or per shift and cubic 
volume, and staff need to be trained to identify replenishment requirements 
and inform either the supervisor or the forklift truck driver, depending on how 
the process has been set up.
One other point to note here is that although real time dictates that replenish­
ment and picking can occur simultaneously, there are issues of worker safety if 
forklift trucks and pedestrian pickers are working together in the same aisle.
This can be alleviated by incorporating multiple picking locations for the 
same SKU, the utilization of flow racking where product is replenished from a 
separate aisle and by carrying out the two activities at different times of the day 
if feasible. For example, receiving and replenishment can take place in the 
morning whilst picking takes place in the afternoon.
Alternatively, replenishment can take place during breaks or after picking 
has been completed for the day. This mirrors what happens at retail stores 
where shelf replenishment takes place when stores are closed overnight. Bendi’s 
introduction of their combined articulated truck and picker will also go some 
way to alleviate the problem of empty pick faces whilst picking.
Value-adding services
Many warehouses have introduced areas where value-adding services can 
be carried out. These are common in both dedicated and shared-user or 
public warehouses where third-party logistics companies are providing an all-
encompassing service to their customers.

Warehouse Management
170
These value-adding services include the following:
●
●(re)labelling;
●
●pricing;
●
●tagging and kimballing;
●
●(re)packing;
●
●bundling, as in ‘buy one, get one free’ (BOGOF) offers;
●
●reconfiguration;
●
●sub-assembly;
●
●repair and refurbishment.
Undertaking shop-floor-ready labelling, tagging, bundling and pricing in the 
warehouse removes the task from the retail assistants who can spend more of 
their time selling.
More sophisticated services include some form of production as in the case 
of postponement where items are added once the customer’s order is known. 
This can include the inclusion of graphics cards and the loading of software in 
the case of personal computers and laptops. It can also include the fitment or 
inclusion of a particular part for a specific market. The UK electrical plug is a 
typical example as it differs from the rest of Europe.
Postponement can be described as a delay in the completion of an item until 
an actual order is received from a customer. Postponement not only saves time 
but reduces inventory holding by reducing the total number of SKUs held in 
stock.
Value-adding services can also include returns processing and a repair ser­
vice. This area is covered in more detail at the end of this chapter.
Sufficient space needs to be made available for these tasks, with access to 
power and being close to the despatch area, thus reducing any unnecessary 
movement. An ideal location, if the height of the warehouse allows it, is above 
the despatch bays on a mezzanine floor.
Indirect activities
There are many support activities that occur in warehouses and are crucial to 
the efficient operation of the warehouse. These are, in the main, undertaken by 
supervisory staff, specialist teams and the housekeeping team. These activities 
include:
●
●ensuring optimum staffing levels and providing a pool of suitably 
trained staff for peak periods;

171
●
●managing the allocation of labour for value-adding services;
●
●ensuring optimum space utilization;
●
●monitoring work flow and congestion;
●
●provision, allocation and maintenance of equipment;
●
●identification and replenishment of fast-moving items;
●
●identification of non-moving stock;
●
●stock integrity and dealing promptly with non-conforming, lost or 
found stock;
●
●managing cycle counts and organizing full stock checks;
●
●security of high-value or hazardous stock; and
●
●ensuring the cleanliness of the warehouse and the safety of both staff 
and visitors.
The above tasks can be separated into three distinct sections:
●
●the management of labour, space and equipment;
●
●the control of stock; and
●
●the security and safety of stock and people.
Stock management
Inventory or stock management and warehouse management tend to be two 
very distinct roles.
Warehouse managers are in a position to advise their inventory colleagues on 
levels of safety stock and the specific movements and characteristics of particular 
stock items. However, they tend to stop short of determining stock levels.
This function is a major part of a company’s operation and the theories and 
practices are covered in many books on the subject of inventory management.
Although the majority of warehouse managers are not involved directly in 
the choice, purchase and replenishment of stock, they can play a role in the 
identification of fast-, medium-, slow-, non-moving and obsolete stock.
This can be done using one of the mainstays of a warehouse manager’s 
armoury – an ABC classification. The information can normally be obtained 
from the WMS and as mentioned in Chapter 4 a simple spreadsheet can cate-
gorize stock items by volume and frequency of sales.
A warehouse manager can extend the normal classification to include non-
moving and obsolete stock together with identifying stock that may not require 
storage in the warehouse but can be despatched direct from the supplier to the 
end customer where the lead-time is in line with the customer’s requirement.

Warehouse Management
172
The classification might look something like that shown in Table 7.1.
Table 7.1

45%
O

S

purchases
X

standard items
The percentages will vary significantly by company and by market sector. 
Maintenance stores are likely to have a high proportion of their stock in the C 
to X categories.
The goal is to identify the items in the C to X categories and act accordingly. 
Obsolete or non-moving stock needs to be analysed and one of the following 
tasks undertaken:
●
●Return to seller if the contract allows.
●
●Sell to staff at a discount.
●
●Sell the item at a highly discounted rate either through normal channels 
or via companies who specialize in selling overstocks and obsolete 
items.
●
●Assess whether it is cost effective to break the item down into its 
constituent parts.
●
●Donate to charities.
●
●Dispose of the product as cheaply as possible. This may incur charges 
but it will release space to store other faster-moving product in its place.

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
173
A quick and easy way of ascertaining whether there is an excess of slow-
moving stock in the warehouse is to calculate the stock turn:
Stock turn = cost of goods sold ÷ average cost of goods stored
or:
Annual throughput in units ÷ average number of units held in stock
For example, an annual throughput of 1,200,000 units with an average stock-
holding of 100,000 units gives a stock turn of 12. That is, the stock turns over 
once per month.
A low turn in most operations suggests that stock sits in a warehouse for far 
too long, implying that the safety stock level has been set too high.
Typical examples of stock turn within companies are as follows:
150 +: world class using just-in-time techniques;
120 +: chilled foods;
18 +: retail;
10–30: European manufacturing;
<3: maintenance stores.
The higher the figure, the better the company is performing in terms of inventory 
management. Maintenance stores will always have low stock turns through 
having to hold stock in case of breakdown.
Stock or inventory counting
All warehouses are obligated to undertake some form of stock count. It depends 
on the law of the country and accounting requirements as to how frequent and 
comprehensive the count is.
We have seen over recent years a move towards cycle counting or perpetual 
inventory counts as a replacement for an all-encompassing annual count of 
stock in the warehouse.
A full stock count usually necessitates the closure of the warehouse for a 
period of time when all inbound and outbound movements are suspended. 
A significant drawback of a single annual count is the difficulty in reconciling 
the discrepancy as it could have occurred over 11 months ago.

Warehouse Management
174
The count is normally carried out at the company’s year-end. Some com­
panies will carry out quarterly or possibly half-yearly checks depending on the 
stipulations laid down by the auditors.
More recently, providing the company can prove that its cycle counting is 
accurate, auditors have agreed in some cases that if each stock line is counted 
and audited at least once per annum that will be sufficient for their needs.
Providing the cycle counts are considered to be accurate, the year-end stock 
figures will be taken from the WMS.
Cycle counting or perpetual inventory counts
When undertaking cycle counts it is prudent to use an ABC analysis to ensure 
that your fast-moving and high-value items are counted more frequently than 
your slow-moving, inexpensive items.
Mis-picks are more likely with fast-moving goods, and high-value items are 
prone to shrinkage.
It is suggested therefore that fast-moving and high-value items are counted 
monthly, medium sellers are counted quarterly and slow-moving items either 
once or twice a year. The following percentages can be used to ensure a com-
prehensive count:
●
●8 per cent of A items counted weekly (ensures each SKU is counted 
approximately once per quarter);
●
●4 per cent of B items counted weekly (counted twice per annum); and
●
●2 per cent of C items counted weekly (counted at least once per annum).
The accuracy of the counts will also determine the frequency. A high error 
rate should result in more frequent counts until the accuracy improves. Each 
discrepancy needs to be investigated and procedures put in place to ensure that 
there is no repeat of the problem.
Increasing the frequency to daily ensures a more accurate count; however, 
this will depend on the number of product lines, available resource and the cost 
of that resource.
The trade-off here is the cost of the error against the cost of discovering it in 
the first place.
As mentioned previously, a number of auditors will be happy (or as happy 
as they can be) if stock in the warehouse is counted at least once during the 
year.

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
175
The count itself
All stock counts require organizing. You need to know who will undertake the 
stock count, what you are planning to count, when you plan to undertake the 
stock count, what tools and equipment you need and the timescale allotted. For 
example, if you are counting at height you will need to ensure the safety of the 
warehouse staff. If you are using forklift trucks a suitable safety cage needs to 
be provided. Under certain health and safety legislation and company rules the 
use of cages on forklift trucks are deemed unacceptable and therefore specialist 
equipment is required such as elevated work platforms (cherry pickers).
Prior to the start of the count ensure that all items have been put away in 
their correct location and try to despatch as many items as possible prior to the 
stock take. Secondly, ensure that any obsolete units are disposed of before 
the start of the count. There is no point in counting stock that shouldn’t be 
in the warehouse.
Some companies will affix a different coloured label on pallets during each 
year’s count. One way of identifying non-moving or slow-moving stock is to 
look for the labels from the earliest stock count. In the past we have identified 
stock items that have gone through a significant number of counts and the 
pallets or cartons have never moved.
It is normal to have a counter and a checker for each section if you are using 
a paper-based system. If you are scanning locations and products, one person 
per section should be sufficient. An auditor is likely to be present during a full 
count to make random checks of locations to verify the count is accurate.
In order to complete a full stock count in the shortest possible time to mini-
mize disruption to sales, companies will inevitably use staff who are unfamiliar 
with the products. As these counts normally take place at weekends or over the 
Christmas and New Year vacations, their motivation to do a thorough job 
might also be suspect.
Where there are a significant number of locations and a number of open 
cartons and individual items to be counted, it is likely that additional staff 
will need to be employed from agencies to assist in the count to ensure it is 
completed in time. However, completion on time is rarely the case as the 
number of discrepancies can take days to resolve. As a result, operations resume 
so as not to let customers down but this tends to compound the problems. 
This is why a number of companies are turning to cycle counts as opposed to 
full-blown stock counts.
Outside agencies who are experienced in stock counts can be employed as 
an alternative but can be expensive and the issue of product familiarity is also 
a factor.
Any discrepancies between the system figures and the count figures should 
be checked immediately by a supervisor and this continues until you arrive at 

Warehouse Management
176
two matching figures, be they the last two counts or the count and the system 
figures.
The likelihood of finding the reasons for a discrepancy are low as a year’s 
transactions have passed through the warehouse since the last count. The root 
cause of discrepancy is seldom discovered and as a result cannot be eliminated.
With a paper system it is usual to provide staff with details of locations and 
product codes but with the quantities removed. Quantities are written on the 
sheets together with any changes to the product codes and other comments 
such as damages are recorded.
This can lead to further inaccuracies as the administration staff try to decipher 
each person’s writing whilst typing the results into a spreadsheet or database.
This system of counting is fraught with problems and if agreed by auditors 
a perpetual inventory counting system should be introduced to replace the 
single annual count.
In terms of performance measures companies need to record the number of 
errors found, not the difference in monetary value as this can hide a number of 
problems. A difference of a few hundred dollars may seem acceptable; however, 
there could be hundreds of errors within the system such as the following:
●
●products in incorrect locations;
●
●too many items of one product; and
●
●too few items of another product.
These may balance out but they need to be logged, measured and corrected 
before operations recommence.
Security
Security of product within the warehouse is paramount. The warehouse man-
ager is responsible for the integrity of all the products under his or her care, 
whether they are owned or stored on behalf of other companies as a third-
party contractor.
This can be achieved through good housekeeping, the use of security cages 
and carousels for storage, and through vigilance by staff.
Poor security costs companies in lost inventory, higher insurance premiums 
and personnel turnover.
Loading docks and platforms tend to be the most vulnerable areas – they’re 
very easy places for a thief to remove stolen property, often in partnership 
with an outsider, a delivery driver for example. Security systems tend to be 
designed to protect your facility from people breaking in – but many thefts 
are perpetrated from within.

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
177
Closed-circuit television at strategic points throughout the warehouse is a 
significant deterrent; however, unannounced inspections and walkabouts are 
also effective and much cheaper.
With regard to the loading bays, one common-sense recommendation is that 
you separate them from employee parking areas, making it much more difficult 
to remove items from the warehouse. Searches on entry and exit, whether insti-
gated by staff or by a random system of lights, is also very effective.
Not only is product security important but also the protection of data. WMSs 
hold a large amount of sensitive data that needs to be protected. Internally this 
can be done through the use of password protection for different access levels 
and firewalls for external protection. The data needs to be backed up daily and 
the backup files stored offsite.
Protecting data from being stolen or copied is also paramount. Equipment 
such as servers, computers and laptops need to be protected. These items 
need to be locked with key or code access, and personal computers need to be 
password protected and those passwords changed regularly.
The core attributes of security within a warehouse are as follows:
●
●appropriate recording of inbound and outbound products;
●
●authorizations for all despatches;
●
●accurate audit trails;
●
●regular stock checks;
●
●the use of appropriate storage equipment; and
●
●vigilance.
Returns processing
Returns processing, or reverse logistics as it has become known, involves the 
handling of product returns, transit packaging and surplus items. The processes 
associated with this operation include repair, reuse, refurbishment, recycling 
and disposal. See Figure 7.1.
The processing of returns has gained increasing importance in the ware-
house over the past few years. There is now an increasing awareness of the 
economic value of reusing products and the effect on cash flow of perfectly 
serviceable items that can be repackaged and made available for sale. There is 
also the possibility of fines if products and packaging are not disposed of in an 
environmentally friendly way.
Doing nothing about returns costs money. They take up space, are difficult 
to count during stock takes, difficult to value and, more importantly, could be

back on sale rather than taking up much-needed space within the warehouse. 
The alternative is ordering further stock with all its inherent costs.
There has also been a greater environmental awareness backed up by legis-
lation such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), 
hazardous waste disposal legislation and more stringent waste packaging 
directives.
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive came into force  
in January 2007 in the EU. Its aim is to both reduce the amount of electrical 
and electronic equipment being produced and to encourage everyone to reuse, 
recycle and recover.
The WEEE Directive also aims to improve the environmental performance 
of businesses that manufacture, supply, use, recycle and recover electrical and 
electronic equipment.
The increase in e-retailing has also seen a significant increase in the level of 
returns into the warehouse. Catalogue retailing has always had significant 
amounts of returns, especially in terms of textiles and clothing. These retailers 
have, in the past, set up returns-processing areas to not only receive the items 
but also clean them, iron them and pack them for resale.
Other such returns include products despatched on a sale-or-return basis 
and those where customers are given the option of a 14-day returns policy. 
These items are likely to be good stock and can be returned to stock almost 
immediately.
Other groups of returns include reusable packaging such as barrels, kegs, 
bins, cages, trays, totes and pallets.
Product recalls are also a significant area, needing to be handled carefully. 
These products need to be quarantined on return so that the company can

ensure, firstly, that all items have been received and are no longer a potential 
danger to the public – which is normally one of the main reasons for recall – 
and secondly, that they are not mixed with good product and sent out in error.
Recently introduced legislation, the cost of landfill both in money and 
environmental terms and the realization that returns can be an expensive area 
to neglect have triggered the growth of reverse logistics programmes and the 
establishment of warehouses built specifically to handle the returns process.
This type of warehouse needs to be set up very differently from a stock-
holding facility. Space needs to be set aside for sortation, inspection, repair, 
refurbishment and disposal. The idea behind returns processing is to either 
return stock into the supply chain as quickly as possible in whatever format,  
be it finished goods or spares, or dispose of it efficiently.
Returned items shouldn’t remain in the facility for too long.
Should you decide to operate the returns function within an existing ware-
house operation then you are likely to set up a warehouse within a warehouse. 
This needs to be carefully planned to avoid cross contamination – for example, 
when dealing with damaged or defective items, chemicals and hazardous 
products.
Prior to making any decision regarding a reverse logistics operation you 
need to calculate the following:
●
●percentage and value of goods returned directly to stock and to vendor;
●
●percentage of goods refurbished and returned to stock;
●
●percentage of goods dismantled and used for spares;
●
●percentage of goods destroyed or given away to charity, etc;
●
●percentage of goods returned due to manufacturing defects; and
●
●percentage of goods returned due to sales department, warehouse or 
consumer error.
With regard to the last two points above you need to look at the causes in more 
detail before putting processes in place. For example, with consumer error it 
could be that the operating instructions are not clear enough.
In order to justify a returns processing operation the following needs to be 
calculated:
Total cost of returns processing + cash flow impact versus purchasing/
manufacturing new + cost of disposal and cash flow impact
A final decision to make with regard to reverse logistics is whether to operate 
the function in-house or subcontract to a third-party specialist. This decision 
very much depends on the following factors:

Warehouse Management
180
●
●level of returns;
●
●available space;
●
●available expertise;
●
●cost;
●
●control and efficacy;
●
●capacity and capability of third parties; and
●
●lead time from return to available to ship.
You need to determine how many hours per week you are likely to expend on 
returns processing and how much space you require. You need to calculate the 
amount of space required at peak, which is more than likely the period after 
Christmas.
With regard to disposal, companies will need to produce the relevant certi-
fication to prove that products and packaging, if not recyclable, have been 
disposed of properly.
Reverse logistics has gained momentum recently and has gone from being 
driven by environmental concern to becoming a corporate cost-reduction 
programme.
According to Stock/WERC (2004) ‘the keys to any successful product returns 
program are having the right combination of people, policies, procedures and 
priorities’.
They go on to say that best practice in terms of returns management requires 
the following:
●
●decision-making process before product is physically returned;
●
●the use of returns authorization notes;
●
●ongoing measurement of product return cycle time;
●
●training of employees in returns handling;
●
●cross training of staff in warehouse operations and reverse logistics;
●
●use of software to monitor and evaluate product returns;
●
●time slots allocated for receipt of returns;
●
●two-stage approach for returns handling – initial processing to identify 
quick wins followed by in-depth examination;
●
●use of detailed product return process maps;
●
●availability of packaging material to re-box product;
●
●undertake regular audits; and
●
●achievement of higher recovery rates (>  80%).

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
181
Despatch
The order cycle time or lead time from order receipt to despatch is continu-
ally shortening and there is increased pressure on the warehouse manager to 
coordinate all activities to ensure that product is despatched on time and 
complete.
Packing – pieces/items/eaches
Once product has been picked there is the question of how it is packaged for 
despatch. As previously discussed, with individual order picks the operator 
may well package the product immediately, attach shipping labels and where 
required insert despatch documentation and invoices.
This reduces the number of touch points in the warehouse but does take the 
operator away from the prime task of picking.
Where there is the possibility of damage in transit, material can be added to 
the carton such as polystyrene and foam pellets, shredded paper, corrugated 
paper, air-filled bags, etc. This again increases time at despatch and puts the 
onus on the customer to dispose of the excess packaging on receipt. Where 
possible this material needs to be recyclable. The use of carton erectors which 
cut the cardboard to fit the contents is one way of overcoming this problem. 
The trade-off here is the cost of the machine versus the labour and material 
cost of doing it manually and the cost to the customer.
If orders are required to be checked on despatch this is an ideal time to add 
the paperwork and affix labels. In terms of checking, items can be removed 
from the pick container, checked against the order and returned to the original 
carton or if the order was picked into a tote it can be transferred to a shipping 
carton. Other methods of checking include weighing the carton and comparing 
this weight with a system generated weight. This is preferable, providing the 
information held in the system is 100 per cent accurate. This also reduces the 
labour required in this area and assists with load planning.
The need to check every order before it leaves the warehouse may well be a 
requirement for very high value products and products such as pharmaceuticals 
but I have to question the need to check every despatch order when it comes to 
other products.
Companies need to measure the accuracy performance of their pickers and 
base the amount of checking on this figure. A picking team that is constantly 
achieving >  99.9 per cent accuracy requires minimum checking. Random 
checks will suffice. Where there is a drop in accuracy the amount of checking 
can be increased for a time but so should the training of the operators until the 
accuracy is restored.

Warehouse Management
182
There is a trade-off here between the cost of the operators who are checking 
every order and the overall cost of mis-picks. There is no point in spending 
£20,000 ($31,400) on a checker per annum to save £3,000 ($4,710).
The introduction of automation into this area of the warehouse enables 
companies to use equipment to automatically insert paperwork into a shipping 
container, attach a lid and label it correctly.
Packing – cartons
Full carton despatch is somewhat easier to manage. Individual cartons may 
require the attachment of a shipping label which may be generated from the 
WMS or from a carrier system such as those operated by UPS, Fed Ex, USPS 
and the Royal Mail. In terms of multiple carton dispatch, firstly there is a need 
to establish whether it is more cost effective to despatch via a parcel network 
or a pallet distribution or LTL carrier.
This will decide the means of shipment – loose cartons or a palletized load.
If palletized, the decision here is how to stabilize the cartons on a pallet for 
despatch. Many companies will use stretchwrap to do this. Some companies 
will stretchwrap manually whilst others utilize an automatic stretchwrap 
machine. The trade-off here is the cost of the machine versus the cost of labour 
and the reduction in the use of stretchwrap material.
Velcro has introduced pallet straps to secure cargo. These are more environ-
mentally friendly than stretchwrap but there is the added complication of 
tracking and returning the straps for reuse.
The use of returnable packaging is also growing under environmental 
pressure. The use of plastic totes and pallets, slipsheets and collapsible cages  
is growing; however, there is a trade-off here between the initial cost of these 
items and the cost of returning them to the shipper versus the cost in money 
and environmental terms of cardboard packaging and one-way pallets.
Loading
The efficient loading of containers and trailers is crucial in today’s environment 
of rising fuel prices. Unused space is inefficient and can cost a company a great 
deal of money.
Efficient loading of vehicles and containers begins with the initial packaging 
of the products.
Companies need to ensure that the outer packaging of their products is 
designed to fit perfectly onto the pallets used for both transportation and 
storage. The ideal is to ensure no overhang whatsoever with a reduction in 
unused space. It also needs to be robust enough to travel.

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
183
Pallet loads need to be configured to ensure that product damage is minimized, 
cubic capacity is fully utilized, load stability is ensured and the configuration is 
acceptable to the receiving location.
Fortunately there is software available to not only assist with pallet con-
figuration but also container and trailer loading. The software can optimize 
packing within a container and trailer, on a pallet and even within an individual 
carton.
This sophisticated software optimization not only takes into account the 
cube of the products but also their load bearing strength and location within 
the container.
The latter ensures ease of off-loading at the receiver with all the cartons 
from the same product line being located together. The software also ensures 
that lighter items are packed on top of the heavier items. Examples include 
Cubemaster and CubeDesigner.
Shipping
Many operations are now taking orders late into the evening and despatching 
that same night for next-day delivery. Next, a retailer in the United Kingdom, 
has a cut-off time for internet orders of 10 pm for next-day delivery.
Work plans are now centred around the latest despatch time for orders, and 
managers work backwards from this ensuring that all processes are completed 
and both labour and equipment are made available at the right time to meet 
these deadlines.
The despatch process has to be managed precisely and be aligned with most 
other activities within the warehouse. If, for example, receiving and despatch 
share the same doors, a daily schedule needs to be drawn up to ensure that 
labour and equipment are utilized as efficiently as possible, the work content  
is matched to the number of doors available and congestion is avoided in the 
dock area.
In many operations receiving tends to take place in the morning whilst 
picking and despatch occur during the afternoon and evening as order cut-off 
times continue to be stretched later into the evening.
Depending on the method of picking and the company’s procedures regard-
ing checking product before it leaves the building, sufficient space needs to be 
available at the loading bays to stage the loads and allow for whichever checking 
method is applied – be it full-carton checks or random checks.
If coordinated correctly, the picked orders should arrive at the loading bay 
in the sequence in which they will be delivered. That is, the last delivery on the 
vehicle will be the first order to be loaded.

Warehouse Management
184
Collecting vehicles should be assigned a bay closest to where the orders have 
been accumulated. This requires close coordination between the gatehouse and 
the despatch supervisor.
Many companies have grids marked out on the warehouse floor at the 
despatch area to replicate the floor area of the largest vehicle. For example,  
a UK warehouse handling industrial pallets solely will currently have a grid 
equivalent to 26 pallets. The introduction of longer vehicles in the future with 
greater cubic capacity will necessitate an increase in the amount of floor space 
set aside for marshalling outbound orders. Warehouses handling euro pallets 
will extend this to 36 pallets. Where vehicles are delivering multiple orders, a 
system needs to be in place to segregate these orders and make them easily 
identifiable to the loading team. This can be a simple handwritten pallet label 
or a barcode label.
Companies with sufficient yard space and available trailers can load product 
directly into them and park them up, awaiting collection.
As discussed in the section on inbound, companies need to manage the arrival 
and departure of trucks for outbound goods. A yard management system (YMS) 
can improve inbound and outbound scheduling, increase visibility of trucks and 
trailers, manage cross-docking, reduce congestion and delays and ensure the 
safety and security of both vehicles and operators.
There are both standalone and modular versions of yard management 
systems.
Where full pallet loads are despatched it may be that pallets are pulled directly 
from the bulk or racked area and immediately loaded onto the vehicle. This 
minimizes the amount of double handling and requires precise coordination.
Once the despatch team is ready, vehicles can be called forward onto the 
despatch bay. This can be done either by the driver of the load or a shunt driver 
who is loading trailers in readiness for collection by drivers returning from 
earlier deliveries.
As with the receiving process, the driver’s paperwork needs to be checked to 
ensure that he is collecting the correct load. Loading a vehicle with goods bound 
for Alaska on a truck scheduled to deliver in Florida will be a very costly mistake.
The trailer should also be checked to ensure that it is fit for purpose, ie clean 
and watertight, doesn’t have any odours which could contaminate the product, 
is at the correct temperature if loading refrigerated product, and finally that the 
floor is damage free.
Where products are loose loaded onto a container or trailer, the use of tele-
scopic boom conveyors will assist the loading process significantly.
A tyre manufacturer recognized a number of advantages after introduc­ 
ing three telescopic booms into the operation. These conveyors can also  

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
185
be moved sideways to cover a number of dock doors. The advantages are as 
follows:
●
●safer working conditions;
●
●cleaner working area with better visibility;
●
●separation of forklifts and operators;
●
●improved ergonomics: no more rolling of the tyres, no more lifting  
of the tyres;
●
●improved quality of the tyres;
●
●fewer claims, having introduced a counting and video system on the 
conveyor; and
●
●improved productivity: 42 per cent increase on tyre loading, 32 per  
cent increase on tyre unloading.
ROI and payback can be significant in terms of labour saving, increased accu-
racy and less damage. A fully installed static conveyor will cost in the region of 
£34,000 in the United Kingdom.
Other companies will use automatic pallet loaders as discussed on page 68, 
whilst the majority of companies will use hand pallet jacks or powered pallet 
trucks if loading from a despatch bay. Counterbalance or articulated forklift 
trucks are normally used if loading outside the warehouse.
The increasing use of double-deck trailers presents its own challenge to 
warehouse operations, with some loading bays having to be adapted to accom-
modate the variable heights.
Where loading bays cannot be adapted there are products such as Transdek’s 
double-deck lifts that can be retro-fitted. The product operates with a hinged 
lift platform that doubles as a dock leveller in order to provide a direct run-
through for product from the warehouse to both single deckers and the bottom 
deck of double deck vehicles.
The lift platform also raises up to 3,000 mm to carry product to/from the

Finally, despatch documentation and labelling needs to be completed to ensure 
compliance with customer requirements and government legislation. Different 
countries will have different requirements and these will also differ if shipments 
are within country or for export.
Any errors in the export paperwork can result in non-shipment, seizure, 
fines or delays.

Warehouse Management

When shipping hazardous material it is essential that products are labelled 
accurately and have the correct documentation.
Typical despatch paperwork depending on ultimate destination includes the 
following:
●
●advanced shipping notice;
●
●manifest;
●
●shipping labels;
●
●Bill of Lading;
●
●commercial invoice;
●
●shipper’s export declaration;
●
●export packing list;
●
●certificate of origin;
●
●export licence;
●
●inspection certificate; and
●
●insurance certificate.
As mentioned above each country will have its own requirements in respect of 
the documentation needed.
Role of the driver
In situations where companies operate with their own transportation there are 
no issues with what the driver’s role is in the actual loading process. However, 
when third-party contractors are used there is the age-old dilemma of what to 
do with the driver whilst the loading process takes place.
Some companies insist on the driver assisting with the loading and checking 
the contents of the load, whilst other companies have health and safety issues 
with external staff being on the loading bay. If the latter is the case then the 
driver has to be accommodated elsewhere, preferably not in his cab. The pos-
sibility of the driver moving off the despatch bay whilst the vehicle is still being 
loaded is just as real.
There is also the question of what the driver should sign for once the vehicle 
has been loaded. If he has not seen the products loaded onto the vehicle and the 
vehicle has been sealed prior to leaving the despatch bay, then it is reasonable 
to suggest that he is at liberty to sign the document and preface it with the 
word ‘unchecked’. A time limit needs to be agreed in terms of how long the 
collecting company has to report any discrepancies.

Warehouse Processes from Replenishment to Despatch and Beyond
187
If the vehicle is sealed, the seal number needs to be recorded on the delivery 
paperwork and any other relevant documentation such as hazardous data 
sheets handed to the driver.
Summary and conclusion
This chapter has examined replenishment, value-adding services, support 
functions and despatch.
We have already suggested that both receiving and picking are crucial roles; 
however, within the warehouse, the above operations are no less important.
Well-timed replenishment will ensure an efficient pick operation whilst a 
timely and accurate despatch ensures that customer lead times are achieved or 
at times surpassed.
The warehouse’s ability to undertake value-adding services enables the 
manufacturer to postpone certain activities until the order arrives, resulting in 
fewer stock codes, and it enables retailers to transfer activities from the retail 
store back to the warehouse, freeing up valuable sales time.
Stock counting and security are fundamental to the integrity of products 
stored in the warehouse and are crucial to maintaining credibility whether an 
in-house or outsourced operation.

Trade isn’t about goods. Trade is about information. Goods sit 
in the warehouse until information moves them.
(C J Cherryh)
Introduction
As we have seen in earlier chapters, the introduction of technology can signi­
ficantly improve warehouse productivity, increase utilization, reduce costs and 
increase customer satisfaction.
As customers become more sophisticated, requiring accurate, secure, fast 
data exchange, and as the competition becomes more intense, companies need 
to have the information-technology tools to support the business and build 
reliability, speed, control and flexibility into the warehouse operation. The ability 
to communicate in real time is crucial in today’s fast-moving technological 
world.
Paper-based warehouse management systems or even spreadsheets can fulfil 
a need and manage stock accurately if managed well. However, I still find it 
incredible that companies can operate a warehouse without a location system, 
relying on staff knowing where the items are located in the warehouse.
Other warehouses have stock control systems that tell you where the stock 
is and how much there is of it, but don’t provide optimum pick paths or slotting 
functionality.
If a company is going to compete effectively it needs to introduce a real-time 
warehouse management system.
The cost of these systems has reduced significantly over the past few years 
and today companies are able to rent systems on a month-by-month basis

using software as a service (SaaS) and cloud computing, in which you can pay 
as you go, share resources and only use the functionality you require.
Warehouse management systems (WMSs) can be stand alone or can be part of 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems supporting the latest technological 
advances within the warehouse including automation, RFID and voice recognition.
Although there has been some consolidation within the WMS marketplace, 
there continues to be a myriad of systems to choose from.
This chapter looks at the process of choosing a WMS and the functionalities 
that assist companies in improving productivity and reducing costs.
Why does a company need a WMS?
Although companies operating with paper-based systems are able to introduce 
best practice into the warehouse such as improving warehouse layout and 
minimizing travel time by having the fastest-selling items closest to despatch, 
they can improve even further and become more productive by introducing 
software technology into the warehouse.
Customers are becoming increasingly demanding and the ability to commu-
nicate via electronic data interchange, have online visibility and receive instant 
replies to queries is more of an expectation than a need. A WMS can be part of 
this solution.
Sales and marketing teams are also desperate for real-time information, 
whilst finance departments are chasing data constantly.
Before we discuss the advantages of a WMS we need to point out that a 
stock-control system is not the same as a WMS. We have come across many 
companies who have purchased an inventory management system in the belief 
that it will operate the warehouse efficiently. Stock-control systems will man-
age the inventory at stock location and quantity level, but the majority of these 
systems will not manage productivity within the warehouse.
In our opinion, in order to be productive, warehouse systems need to be able 
to work in real time, manage all the processes within the warehouse and have 
the ability to communicate with other company systems. We will go into more 
detail as to the minimum requirements of the system later in this chapter.
A WMS can process data quickly and coordinate movements within the 
warehouse. It can produce reports and handle large volumes of transactions as 
experienced in e-commerce operations.
The introduction of new technologies into your operation not only improves 
your competitiveness in a challenging market but can also be instrumental in 
meeting ever-increasing customer demands.

The potential benefits of having a WMS in place include the following:
●
●real-time stock visibility and traceability;
●
●improved productivity;
●
●accurate stock;
●
●reduction in mis-picks;
●
●automatic replenishments;
●
●reductions in returns;
●
●accurate reporting;
●
●improved responsiveness;
●
●remote data visibility;
●
●improved customer service; and
●
●minimized paperwork.

Warehouse Management Systems

There is an adage that says that any IT system costs twice as much as quoted, 
takes twice as long to implement and produces half the benefits. In order to 
avoid this, there are a number of simple steps that need to be followed when 
choosing a WMS.
Choosing a WMS
When choosing the right WMS for a company you first need to fully understand 
the needs of the company and the key business requirements, not only today 
but some time into the future.
You need to understand your company strategy, ensure that your specific needs 
are met by selecting the solution that best matches your business objectives.
The solution can either be sourced internally by writing your own software 
or you need to ensure that you choose the right business partner to work with 
to develop the most effective solution.
A final step will be to calculate the return on investment (ROI) on the pur-
chase and ongoing support of the WMS.
The process
It may be argued that not everyone needs a WMS. In fact, one of the greatest 
challenges to introducing a WMS is not choosing the right system but convinc-
ing the management team that one is required in the first place.
During a project to improve the space utilization and productivity within a 
client’s warehouse we were surprised to learn that the warehouse manager had 
not been fully involved in discussions regarding the new ERP system that was 
going to be introduced in the near future.
The vendor was asked whether their system could run the warehouse 
operation and they replied in the affirmative. Unfortunately the system being 
introduced could manage the inventory but was not a warehouse management 
system.
When the new system had been implemented, the finance, sales and market-
ing teams were very happy with it but the warehouse manager was left to operate 
a manual system to manage the workflow through the warehouse. As a result, 
stock visibility improved on the system but productivity didn’t change. When 
we suggested that the warehouse required a WMS to integrate with the ERP 
system we were told that no further investment would be made in the IT 
system as the system was able to manage inventory perfectly well.

Selecting the right WMS
To ensure that the system you choose is the right one for your operation, here 
are some best-practice guidelines courtesy of Business Application Software 
Developers Association (BASDA) (2009) and Sage Accpac (2005):
●
●Form a project team.
●
●Define, record, review and improve current processes. Don’t automate 
redundant or poor processes
●
●Create a list of key functions required of the new system.
●
●Incorporate any future growth plans in your specification.
●
●List the benefits to your company of a WMS.
●
●Research and approach a select number of vendors and select a small 
number with experience of providing solutions for your market sector.
●
●Visit reference sites to look at operational effectiveness and discuss the 
benefits the WMS system has brought about since implementation.
●
●Produce a return on investment (ROI) report.
We will now look at each stage in more detail.
Form a project team
Assemble a team of people capable of logical thinking who will decide what 
your company needs from a WMS and what functionalities it must have and 
those it will be nice to have. The team should include members from finance, 
sales, production (if applicable), IT and of course the warehouse.
Appoint a project leader and define each person’s role, responsibilities and 
their level of involvement in terms of time and decision making during this 
process. Ensure that all participants are able to make available the time and 
resources to ensure the success of the project.
Define, record, review and improve current processes
The first stage of the design process is to collect and collate as much information 
as possible about current processes and procedures. Once this is done you need 
to go through each process to decide whether it is actually required. There is no 
point in specifying an IT solution for a defunct process.
Do not make the error of automating poor processes. You need to get the 
processes within the company right before contemplating introducing a WMS. 
Use a project team and your warehouse staff to identify which processes they 
find frustrating, redundant and inefficient.

Warehouse Management Systems
193
You need to understand which processes are going to be improved by the 
introduction of technology, by how much and whether it is cost effective.
Understand how the warehouse communicates both internally with other 
departments and externally with customers, suppliers and transport companies.
Create a list of key functions
Each project team member needs to compile a list of the key functions required 
of a system and rank them by importance, eg 1, 2 or 3; or essential, greatly 
desired or nice to have.
Produce an agreed list of the essential requirements from the ideas produced 
by the individual team members and document them ready to be included in a 
request for information (RFI).
This list should only have the essential, ‘must have’ functions. This will 
enable you to quickly discard systems that do not meet your fundamental 
requirements.
Incorporate any future growth plans in your 
specification
Although difficult to forecast, you need to take into account likely future events 
when specifying a WMS. For example: are you looking to increase the number 
of SKUs significantly over the next few years; will your future operation require 
a ‘kitting’ operation; will you need to manage a group of warehouses; are you 
contemplating the use of a bonded warehouse, which systems are you likely to 
need to interface with, what technology are you planning to introduce? These 
are just some of the questions that need to be answered prior to specifying a 
new system.
List the benefits to your company of a WMS
The right WMS can maximize the productivity of your labour, increase both 
space and equipment utilization and increase accuracy. All of these need to be 
quantified and presented alongside the ROI report.
Approach a select number of vendors; visit  
reference sites
There are a plethora of WMS vendors in today’s marketplace offering ERP 
systems that incorporate WMS, best-of-breed WMSs, stock-control systems 
and SaaS systems. Fortunately, there is assistance out there for companies. 

Warehouse Management
194
These include consultants, comparison websites and, not to be underestimated, 
the experience of your own staff.
If you are in somewhat of a niche market it is always prudent to look at the 
systems your competitors are operating. When we took on the warehousing 
and distribution operation for a publishing house we realized we needed a 
system that could manage royalties, etc.
Visit reference sites to look at operational effectiveness and discuss the 
benefits the WMS system has brought about since implementation.
Prior to a full invitation to tender, discuss your requirements with a couple 
of vendors and ask to visit some of their operational sites. Discussions with 
existing users will give you further insight into system capabilities and poten-
tially revise your own thinking on systems.
Produce an ROI report
Having undertaken sufficient research, detail your requirements and approach 
a select number of companies to quote.
Having received the quotes and before making any decisions, involve your 
finance colleagues in calculating the potential return on investment. Together 
with an ROI calculation you need to be certain of the following, according to 
Stephen Cross (2010) from ATMS:
●
●the potential for a WMS to give you improved stock accuracy – by 
reducing errors, providing real-time information and enabling perpetual 
inventory;
●
●the potential for increased productivity and cost savings – through 
improved labour and equipment utilization, and better space utilization;
●
●the need for improved traceability – a WMS can give you two-way 
traceability, almost as a by-product of being in place; and
●
●improved customer and client service – through overall improved 
warehouse control, improved pick and despatch accuracy.
The cost of a WMS can be broken down into the following main components:
●
●Licence: the software licence needed to run the system. Typically this is 
charged by user, ie PC user or radio data terminal user, although different 
models are now being offered, including paying by transaction and/or 
paying monthly rather than a single outright payment.
●
●Professional services: the costs for project management, training and 
go-live support.
●
●Development costs: software development costs for requirements not 
catered for in the package, including interfaces to third-party systems.

Warehouse Management Systems
195
●
●Support cost: this is typically an annual cost based on licence costs and 
often development costs; look at this cost carefully: the scope of service 
and cost varies significantly from supplier to supplier.
●
●Hardware and infrastructure costs.
Ask suppliers to indicate which prices are firm and which are variable. Watch 
out for hidden costs such as travel costs, travel time and project management 
time.
Summarize all the costs in a spreadsheet, showing the initial cost and then 
costs for years one to five with accumulated totals. You will find that some 
systems look attractive initially but when costed over a longer period they may 
prove a lot more expensive.
What to look for in a system
In order to be effective, a WMS needs to have the following attributes (adapted 
from Ruriani 2003):
Ability to interface with other systems
The ability to interface with other systems such as accounts packages, ERP 
and MRP systems and transport management systems, is critical. The system 
needs to integrate with back-office tasks such as order entry, inventory control, 
purchase-order modules and invoicing. The system also needs to be able to 
interface with automation systems, conveyors, MHE and the latest in picking 
technology such as voice, wearable scanners, RFID and pick- and put-to-light 
systems. Ensure that these WMS interfaces will not incur excessive costs.
Modular and scalable
Where possible, look for a modular system where you only pay for the func-
tionalities you require and training and implementation can be quicker. Further 
modules can be added at a later date if required.
Ensure that the WMS can be expanded to accommodate growth and/or 
acquisitions. Ensure that it is capable of handling e-commerce transactions 
(if applicable) and can update web page details in real time.
A WMS needs to be able to at least meet your basic current and potential 
future needs. Buying a system that has functionality way beyond your require-
ments only leads to increased training costs, time wastage and as a consequence 
a poor return on your investment.

Warehouse Management
196
Ensure that the system can operate with the maximum number of users 
you are planning on having and can manage multiple sites if required.
Check with other divisions within the company to ensure that the system 
has the capabilities to match requirements in those areas also, should the 
management decide to go company-wide with the solution.
Accessible
With the mobility of staff these days it is essential that the system is accessible 
remotely over the web and that it is secure with access levels being password 
protected. The ability to retrieve data simply is a must for any system. The abil-
ity of the system to produce performance reports, cost-to-serve modelling and 
standard inventory interrogation are expected functionalities and should be 
high on the list of priorities.
Ease of operation
Select a WMS that is user friendly. Choose a system that has a point-and-click 
operating environment and clear, easy-to-read screens. This can lead to enhanced 
staff productivity and system acceptance. Ensure that the system works in real 
time, providing instant inventory updates.
Standard system
Ensure the system supports the widely accepted standards currently in use and 
isn’t limited to a proprietary standard that your customers may not use. Check 
that you receive updates regularly at no additional or at minimal cost.
Meets specific needs
If you are involved in storing Customs and Excise goods, ensure that the system 
is approved or can be approved by the relevant authorities. Second, ensure that 
the system can undertake those tasks that are crucial to your business such as 
tracking lot and serial numbers (if required), managing ‘best before’ dates, 
identifying hazardous goods and being able to calculate royalties, for example.
Capable of supporting warehouse best practice
According to BASDA, to achieve best warehouse practice, systems need to be 
able to optimize movements within the warehouse, eg pallet put-away is cou-
pled with pallet retrieval, known as task interleaving. Other crucial attributes 

Warehouse Management Systems
197
include automated receipt, directed put-away, optimum pick sequences, replenish­
ment tasks, despatch management and warehouse mapping.
Ideally the system will be able to monitor the velocity of items within the 
warehouse and locate them accordingly (slotting) or alternatively provide the 
data in a format that can be transferred to programmes that have slotting 
functionality.
Reporting capabilities
Ensure the system provides comprehensive reporting suites and also reports 
failures.
Selecting a partner
This is not the type of purchase you would make through an e-auction. As with 
many large service offerings such as outsourcing, the likely success of the 
project will ultimately come down to your relationship with the people at the 
software vendor. As a previous manager of mine told me, ‘People buy people’, 
therefore it is very important to meet the vendors, not only the sales staff but 
also the operations and support staff.
The main aspects to look for in a partner include the following:
●
●Experience. Look for providers that employ staff with significant 
operational experience as well as staff with the ability to produce 
best-in-class WMSs. Not only will the operational staff have had  
input into the WMS but they will also be able to understand your  
own requirements better. Choose a vendor who listens effectively  
and understands your organization fully.
●
●Longevity. Check how long the company has been in business and  
what their creditworthiness is like; be assured, they will certainly  
check yours.
●
●Choose a vendor who emphasizes the benefits of the software, not just 
the features. Furthermore, choose a provider that has already installed 
WMS systems with clients in your industry.
●
●Ensure that the vendor can supply not only the system but also the 
installation, training, maintenance and help-desk service.
●
●Verify that your prospective WMS provider is reinvesting significant 
capital into research and development, and future product 
enhancements.

Warehouse Management
198
●
●Choose a vendor you are comfortable working with. Try to find a 
vendor who is culturally similar to your company, is professional and 
well respected in the industry. Ask for a large list of customers and visit 
the customer sites that you decide upon.
●
●Choose a partner that has reasonable modification rates and is willing 
to set up a realistic budget based on your needs assessment, prior to 
formalizing the relationship. Alternatively, look to set up an agreement 
where your own IT staff are able to introduce certain modifications.
●
●Resources. Make sure that the WMS provider can fully support you 
during the implementation phase.
●
●Select a partner that has an adequately staffed help desk and that is 
available during your company’s hours of operation. Time zones can 
cause innumerable problems if they are not taken into account at the 
outset.
●
●Select a partner that has established partnerships with hardware 
providers.
Before the final decision
Ask prospective WMS providers for case studies where they have previously 
interfaced with your organization’s specific ERP, transport management or 
accounting system. Ask to visit sites where this has happened and is currently 
happening.
Prior to making a final selection, ask the WMS provider to share a detailed 
implementation plan that includes an installation timeline and resource 
commitment.
Implementation
The following rules need to be followed prior to implementing the new system:
●
●Discuss with the business a suitable time to introduce a new system.  
The quietest sales period is normally a good time; however, this does 
coincide with staff taking their holidays, so ensure all the key people  
are available.
●
●Agree a realistic implementation plan with the vendor and your project 
team.

Warehouse Management Systems
199
●
●Guarantee the availability of key staff during the implementation  
phase.
●
●Propose deadlines you are confident in achieving.
●
●Have specific milestones in place.
●
●Appoint super users from amongst your staff.
●
●Develop a training agenda for all staff and include it in your new staff 
induction programme.
●
●Don’t look to modify the system until it is in place and working as 
initially specified.
●
●Keep reviewing the timeline and act on any slippage.
Some companies will also look to continue running their existing system in 
parallel until the new system is fully operational, all the functionalities have 
been user tested and any issues have been addressed.
Software as a service
Companies that have identified a need for a WMS but do not have the capital 
to spend on a stand-alone system are turning to alternatives.
Software as a service (SaaS) WMS is an internet-based application that is 
developed, hosted and maintained by a third-party software provider on secure 
servers. The vendor rents out the system to a number of different clients. Those 
clients in turn will choose the various modules within the software they require 
and pay for them as they use them.
The advantages are as follows:
●
●lower cost of entry;
●
●reduced start-up costs;
●
●instant upgrades;
●
●user-driven innovation; and
●
●ability to turn on and off as required, eg to run a temporary warehouse 
operation.
Such a system will be attractive to start-up companies and small and medium 
size enterprises (SMEs), although it could benefit larger companies who are 
looking for a temporary solution.
Potential disadvantages include the possibility of poor internet links between 
the companies and potential worries over data security. Constant upgrades can 
also potentially have repercussions on your own processes.

As with most things in life, rental or leasing can work out more expensive 
than outright purchase, therefore calculating whole-life costs and closely 
examining the advantages and disadvantages are paramount before making 
these decisions. However, as a short-term fix they can be very advantageous.
Cloud computing
With cloud computing, your WMS vendor hosts the software application and 
hardware infrastructure for you. You access the WMS via a web browser and 
gain the functional benefits of a new WMS without the upfront software costs 
(www.highjump.com).
CASE STUDY 
LPT
LPT, the Liverpool-based fresh-produce terminal, has partnered with ATMS, its WMS 
provider, to help to bring the ATMS GlobalTrack service to market.
The ATMS STP WMS is a key part of LPT’s operation, helping to optimize the 
receipting, warehousing and despatching operations. LPT’s warehouse is a state-of-
the-art, brand new, temperature-controlled facility with 5,000 locations and caters  
for cross docking as well as added-value services. ATMS’s system supports and 
optimizes all of these processes, including dock, yard and vessel management.
‘LPT needed to go one step further to provide a level of service for its customers 
far ahead of anything in the market place,’ states Andy Rickard, operations director 
of LPT. ‘One of the reasons we selected ATMS was because of their strategy of 
developing their WMS to become the core of a global tracking and supply chain 
visibility offering – in the form of GlobalTrack; we’re very pleased to be one of the 
first companies to work with them to prove the benefits of GlobalTrack in the real 
world.’
Stephen Cross, ex-managing director of ATMS plc, says: ‘GlobalTrack is a hosted 
solution that provides improved control and visibility across the supply chain. It is 
designed to be exceptionally easy to use and exceptionally low cost; for instance, 
users can pay for system usage on a per transaction, pay as you go basis. It is fully 
multilingual and is supported by offices in UK, Dubai, Singapore, China and Manila.’
The system helps users improve the control of their import-tracking process. 
Order and fulfilment requirements can be logged onto the system. The system then 
allows producers and manufacturers, wherever they are in the world, to log their

production and productivity against these orders and call-offs. A facility is then 
provided for remote labelling of cartons, pallets and unit-load devices. Labelling is 
carried out to the global GS1 standard, the barcode on each label is unique and 
identifies the carton, pallet or other item and its contents; the system records quality, 
traceability and other conformance information. Pack sizes, weights and dimensions 
can also be recorded. The system can then be used to generate and share packing 
lists, manifests and advanced shipping information. Information can also be provided 
to and from customs authorities, freight forwarders and logistics providers.
Pre-labelling and electronic advanced shipment notices help LPT receive stock 
accurately and swiftly. Any errors are alerted automatically.
The system not only assists the upstream operation but can be used downstream 
as well, from the point of despatch from LPT, through re-warehousing and cross-
docking operations, to proof of delivery. GlobalTrack supports proof of delivery and 
has a remote warehouse control module that allows warehouses to be controlled 
with the use of hand-held terminals communicating over mobile phone GPRS 
networks.
The system is designed for in-house and third-party use – for instance, the system 
is designed to allow clients of third-party logistics providers to view their own stock 
and their own supply chain information – and only their own. Information visible 
across the web includes production information, receipt and despatch information, 
stock status, quality control status. Documentation can be downloaded remotely. 
Stock call-offs and other action requests can be entered remotely.
David Hughes, who heads up business development at ATMS, comments: ‘We are 
proud to be a strategic partner of LPT. They are a highly innovative operation with a 
superb management team, with the dedication and focus to deliver a first-class 
service from a first-class facility.’
James Woodward, managing director of LPT, comments: ‘LPT is in a unique 
position geographically to reduce customer costs whilst reducing their carbon 
footprint and now is in a unique position technologically to provide the highest levels 
of visibility, traceability and control.’
Summary and conclusion
As can be seen from the case study, today’s information technology systems are 
no longer purely involved in stock management. They also include dock, yard 
and labour management. They are ultra flexible, provide remote access and 
visibility of stock and tasks and can be operated on a pay as you go basis.

Warehouse Management
202
A WMS is essential in today’s fast-moving environment. Information is the 
key and real-time data is invaluable. The introduction of a WMS can improve 
speed, productivity and accuracy.
The key to a successful purchase and implementation is:
●
●preparation and allocating sufficient time and resource to the project;
●
●getting your processes right before introducing the system;
●
●producing a base level so that the full benefits of the system can be 
compared;
●
●getting the buy-in and involvement of senior management and 
warehouse staff;
●
●choosing the most appropriate supplier; and
●
●ensuring that all staff are trained to an acceptable level.
However, to embark on a WMS project you need to be certain that you are 
going to achieve significant business benefits.
Warehouse efficiency is key to effectively managing a supply chain and achiev-
ing best-in-class performance. Technology can be an enabler in this respect.

Warehouse 
layout
Giving a man space is like giving a dog a computer:  
the chances are he will not use it wisely.
(Bette-Jane Raphael)
Introduction
Today’s highly competitive and constantly changing markets have a significant 
effect on the design of our warehouses and distribution centres. Continually 
evolving products and changing order profiles require our warehouses to be a 
great deal more flexible.
Fortna a company involved in warehouse design argue that there isn’t an 
optimal design solution for each warehouse. The most optimal design in their 
view is one that fully meets today’s operational requirements but has an eye to 
future growth by being flexible, scalable and relatively inexpensive to adapt. 
The idea is to design for the future whilst building for today.
A typical example is the introduction of mezzanine floors at a future date, 
thus fully utilizing the cubic capacity of the building.
The design of a warehouse requires attention to detail and the collection and 
compilation of large quantities of relevant data.
Whether a company is building a new warehouse, moving into an existing 
building or looking to re-design their own facility there are a number of funda-
mental areas that need to be addressed.
In this chapter we will look at the drivers involved in warehouse design, 
the alternatives available in terms of layout and suggest potential areas for 
cost savings through relatively simple changes to existing configurations and

We do not intend to show you how to fully design a warehouse as every

doesn’t work in terms of efficient space utilization. This chapter provides infor-
mation on the type of storage equipment that can be utilized to improve space 
utilization.
The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport has published on this 
subject and provides a step-by-step guide to warehouse design (Baker et  al 
2010). Again, as in many other warehouse areas, design is all about trade-offs. 
Between speed, travel distances, space utilization, handling, access, safety, risk 
and cost.
There are also many consultants, materials-handling and racking companies 
who can assist you in designing the most effective warehouse layout based on the 
available space, your requirements and your budget. There are also simulation 
software packages that enable you to ‘build’ the warehouse on a computer and 
simulate the operation to see which layout is the most effective (see Figure 9.1).
When (re-)designing a warehouse there are a number of factors that need to 
be taken into account. These include the company’s likely growth over the next 
5 to 10 years, the possible change in product profile, total and types of sales 
during this period and the likely sales channels such as online B2B, B2C and 
retailer sales.
There are also a number of things that can be done to facilitate the design 
process. This following section will outline how to approach a warehouse 
(re-)design.

The areas to concentrate on are as follows:
●
●Gather as much data as possible and analyse it.
●
●Try to imagine the business in 5–10 years’ time and build in flexibility.
●
●Concentrate on the cubic capacity of the building.
●
●Ensure the design is sympathetic to the existing storage equipment and 
MHE (if applicable).
●
●Put the health and safety of staff at the forefront of the design.
–– In order to retain a conscientious and motivated workforce ensure 
that the facility has sufficient lighting and ventilation.
–– Provide ergonomic equipment.
●
●Reduce the amount of movement required within the warehouse.
●
●Try to standardize the packaging both for movement and storage.
●
●Understand the local building regulations and floor loading 
requirements.
●
●Don’t forget the outside of the building.
Data collection and analysis
The item and order profiling discussed earlier in the book will provide you with 
an understanding of existing requirements in terms of receipt and despatch 
areas, storage and picking operations and, finally, areas needed for undertaking 
value-adding services and returns processes if applicable.
The profile needs to include the whole product range, the number of items per 
line, the sizes and throughput for each product code. One point to emphasize 
here is to ensure that you have identified non-moving and obsolete stock for 
disposal. There is no point in moving and making space in the new warehouse 
for redundant stock.
Additional data required includes the number of supplier deliveries per day 
and the average intake together with the number of customer deliveries and the 
average order size. You will also need to know the method for loading and 
unloading these vehicles.
A survey by Cranfield University (Baker and Perotti 2008) indicated that 
52 per cent of the warehouse floor area is typically used for storage, 17 per cent 
for the pick/pack operation, 16 per cent for receiving and despatch, 7 per cent 
for value-adding services and a further 7 per cent for areas such as battery 
charging, empty pallet storage and other uses. This of course will very much 
depend on the type of operation envisaged.

Warehouse Management
206
The main floor-space areas within the warehouse that need to be calculated 
are as follows:
●
●receiving area;
●
●quarantine and inspection area;
●
●reserve storage area;
●
●carton-picking area;
●
●item-pick area;
●
●value-adding services area;
●
●packing area;
●
●despatch area;
●
●cross-dock area;
●
●empty pallet and packaging storage area;
●
●MHE charging areas;
●
●warehouse offices; and
●
●restrooms.
The information collected is normally current or historical and therefore future 
volumes and changes in product characteristics also need to be taken into account.
Furthermore, the use of averages can be misleading, and you need to decide 
on how you deal with peaks in the business.
An example of where the use of averages can be misleading is as follows. 
Within an order profile we have 100 orders with a single line item and 100 orders 
with three line items. In total we have 200 orders and 400 lines. If we calculate 
the average we end up with two lines per order which doesn’t feature at all in 
the order profile. Although simplistic in nature we need to be aware of such 
possibilities on a larger scale. In these circumstances we need to determine the 
median and mode so that we can see the most popular line per order profile.
Very few operations have a level volume of storage and activity throughout 
the year. For many companies there are a number of peaks and troughs.
The question is whether we plan for and accommodate peaks in business, 
whether we design for the average activity or somewhere in between. According 
to Frazelle (2002), if the duration of the peak period is short and the ratio of 
peak to average is high, then it is worth considering temporary storage and 
labour for this overspill. If the peaks are extended and the ratio of peak to 
average is much smaller, the warehouse and labour requirements should be 
sized at or near peak requirements.
The suggestion is that you size near to average if the ratio is more than 1:5 
and the peak lasts for less than half a year. You should size near the peak when 
the ratio is less than 1:2 and the peaks last longer.

Warehouse Layout
207
You also need to take into account fluctuations between days of the week 
and not rely on weekly or monthly averages. Chapter 11 examines this in more 
detail.
As mentioned, there are a number of software programs on the market that 
can calculate the amount of space required for specific operations, and storage 
equipment companies are more than happy to assist you in these calculations.
In the absence of sophisticated software or if you are looking for high-level 
calculations at an early stage, there are some rule-of-thumb calculations that 
can assist you in ascertaining the amount of space required for certain opera-
tions and the number of pallets that can be stored in a specific area.
Space calculations
These calculations are based on experience and are not intended to provide 
definitive answers to space requirements.
Receipt and despatch areas
This area is sometimes overlooked in favour of storage space; however, this is 
one of the most important areas in the warehouse. The warehouse operation 
relies on sufficient space both inside and outside the dock bays.
Getting the right balance between the number of doors, equipment and labour 
is difficult to achieve and as discussed in Chapter 3 requires the coordination 
of arrivals and departures with available resources.
A congested dock area can result in arrival and departure delays, lost or 
misplaced product, incorrect despatches and damage to items.
The following rule-of-thumb formula can be used to calculate the likely 
space requirement for staging vehicles on arrival and departure:
Space = 
(number of loads × hours to unload)
Time of shift 
 × (number of pallets × space per pallet)
For example: if we receive 20 vehicles per day, 26 pallets per load with a pallet 
size of 1.2 metres by 1.0 metres and it takes 45 minutes per load to unload and 
30 minutes per load to check and we operate an eight-hour shift:
Pallet floor space = {round-up ((20 × 1.25) ÷ 8) × (26 × (1.2 × 1))} 	 
= 4 × 31.2  
= 124.8 square metres

Warehouse Management
208
In addition to this space we need to add working and travel space around the 
pallets. This space will be determined by the type of forklift or pallet truck used 
to unload and load the vehicles. Potentially this can more than double the 
amount of space required for the pallets themselves and depends on how much 
access to the pallet is required. For example, a full 360-degree access to the 
pallet, allowing 0.5 metres of travel corridor, requires an additional 2.2 square 
metres of working space per pallet.
The ability to preload trailers will reduce the amount of space required at 
the despatch bay. The proviso here is that there are sufficient doors and/or yard 
space to accommodate the number of loaded trailers. The ability to double 
stack pallets will reduce the space required but will also limit the type of pallet 
truck utilized.
There may also be a requirement for a cross-dock area where goods having 
been received into the warehouse but not put away are to be despatched en 
bloc to a customer who has yet to collect the goods. This could take anywhere 
between a day and a month to despatch. Under these circumstances it may be 
prudent to use drive-in racking in the despatch area, for example to minimize 
product damage.
Storage space
Calculating the amount of storage space required and the storage medium de-
pends on a large number of factors.
Each item needs to be evaluated and a table produced to record the different 
item properties and as a result decide on potential storage media.
Having calculated the amount of items stored per product line and con-
verted these into pallet quantities, we are able to calculate the total number of 
pallets we need to store, by product line.
Once this has been calculated, produce a chart detailing the number of pal-
let locations required and the height requirement for each location (Table 9.1).
Depending on the nature of the product in terms of weight, crushability, etc, 
it is likely that the pallet heights will vary between products and some products 
may only require bin or tote storage as the quantities are so low.
The next decision is the type of storage medium to use. This can include 
block stacking, pallet racking, automated storage, shelf and bin locations or a 
combination of some or all.
Table 9.2 shows the characteristics of each individual stock item and the 
possible storage media envisaged.
As can be seen from Table 9.2, we have recorded as much information as 
possible regarding the storage and order profile of the products listed. This 
gives us the opportunity to decide on the most suitable storage and handling

medium. A similar table can be produced to determine the size of the pick face 
location(s) for each product where we need to take into account the average 
and maximum amount of product despatched per day.
The idea is to make sure that we do not have to replenish these locations 
during picking and therefore we need to size the locations appropriately 
based on the number of items picked per day. The number and size of the pick 
locations will depend on the available ground floor locations (initially) and 
cubic capacity of those locations.
Having produced a rule-of-thumb formula for calculating dock space there 
is a formula to calculate the number of pallets that can be stored within a given 
cubic area when using standard adjustable pallet racking. This is as follows:
 (Number of width modules × pallets in a module width) × (number of length 
modules × pallets in module length) × number of height modules
where:
Module width	 =	width of aisle + 2 pallet lengths (short side) +	
 
clearance between back-to-back pallets
Module length	=	width of upright + 3 × clearance + 2 pallets (long side)	
Module height	=	height of pallet + clearance above pallet plus	
 
racking beam height
For example, based on the following dimensions:
Aisle width: 3.0 metres
Pallet size: 1.20 metres × 1.00 metre
Width of upright: 0.12 metre
Clearance (sides): 0.10 metre
Clearance (height): 0.15 metre
Clearance back-to-back pallets: 0.10 metre
Racking beam height: 0.14 metre
Height of goods: 1.20 metres
Height of pallet: 0.15 metre
Warehouse height: 10 metres
Storage area length: 120 metres

Warehouse Management
212
Storage area width: 48 metres
Module width = 3.0 + 2 + 0.1 = 5.1 metres
Module length = 0.12 + 0.3 + 2.4 = 2.82 metres
Module height = (1.2 + 0.15) + 0.15 + 0.14 = 1.64 metres
Number of width modules = 48 ÷ 5.1 = 9
Number of length modules = 120 ÷ 2.82 = 42
Number of height modules = 10 ÷ 1.64 = 6
Total pallet capacity = (9 × 2) × (42 × 2) × 6 = 9,072 pallets
Therefore in a cubic space of 120 metres by 48 metres by 10 metres we have a 
capacity to store 9,072 pallets based on an overall pallet dimension of 1.2 metres 
by 1.0 metre by 1.35 metres and utilizing a reach truck working within an aisle 
width of 3 metres.
The number of pallets that can be stored in this particular area is determined, 
in the main, by the aisle width, type of racking and the size of pallet.
As mentioned earlier, this is a rule-of-thumb calculation and other factors 
need to be taken into account before committing to these figures.
The calculations take into account the aisles between the racking but do not 
take into account aisles and gangways at the front of the racking. They do not 
take into account potential pallet overhang, rear walkways and fire exits.
Other factors that need to be taken into account are:
●
●Planned utilization within the warehouse. It is agreed that once storage 
utilization exceeds 85 per cent, productivity and safety decline. The 
operation will slow appreciably as put-away is delayed whilst space is 
being freed up.
●
●The presence and location of roof columns. Storage equipment 
manufacturers will take this into account when producing plans.
●
●The requirement for space between the backs of pallets (flue) and at  
the sides of pallets.
●
●The presence and location of sprinklers (ceiling or in rack). The 
overhead pipes and sprinklers will limit the height both within the 
warehouse and within the racking itself.
●
●The type of lighting utilized and any heating or cooling systems 
installed.
●
●Lift height of forklift truck. Different types of forklift truck will have 
different lift-height capabilities.

Warehouse Layout
213
●
●Pallet orientation (short facing or long facing). How a pallet is stored 
within the racking has its own trade-off within the warehouse. Storing  
a pallet with the long face parallel to the aisle makes it easier for 
operators to pick, not having to stretch too far across the pallet. 
However, storing the pallet with the short side parallel to the aisle 
means greater flexibility (UK and euro pallets can be stored in the  
same bay) and more pallets can be stored in a length of racking.
Number of pallets per beam (three pallets between the uprights  
will increase the number of pallets stored by removing a number  
of uprights). This can save up to 4 per cent of space. However, the 
maximum weight per beam needs to be adhered to.
●
●The requirement for cross aisles within the racking to reduce travel  
and the need for walkways between the end of the racking and the  
wall to provide escape routes for staff.
●
●Type of racking, for example:
–– Double-deep racking will reduce the number of aisles required.
–– Narrow aisle storage requires less aisle width.
–– Drive-in or satellite racking doesn’t operate with aisles.
–– Flow racks only require two aisles depending on the length of the 
lane or potentially three if they are operated back to back.
If the operation is planning to have pick faces on the floor, ie underneath the 
reserve storage racks, we need to take into account the total number of floor 
locations that will be set aside for carton-pick locations and shelf locations. We 
also need to be aware of part-pallet receipts and part-pallet locations if we 
have to pick from height.
Aisle width
A crucial aspect of warehouse layout is aisle width. This is the distance between 
pallets in adjacent racks. To ensure safety we need to calculate the distance 
between the pallets once they have been put onto the racks.
The aisle width is determined by the turning circle of the forklift truck and 
the size of pallet being carried.
Exceptions to this are narrow aisle and turret trucks which operate in aisles 
which are based on the width of the truck itself whilst articulated forklift 
trucks calculate aisle width based on the distance diagonally across the pallet, 
ie from one corner to another when a pallet is being rotated in the aisle. The 
safety clearance of 100 mm either side (200 mm in total) of a typical pallet 
will need to be added to ensure fast pallet put-away and retrieval. The second 

Warehouse Management
214
dimension is the overall width of the truck chassis when travelling along the 
stacking aisle.
Manufacturers of forklift trucks will provide recommendations on the 
minimum aisle width required for their trucks.
Deciding on the optimal aisle width is a critical part of an overall storage/
materials-handling strategy. Aisle width decisions need to achieve the best 
combination of productivity, space utilization, flexibility, safety and equipment 
costs for the specific application (Piasecki 2002). Other factors include the depth 
of the pallet on the truck and whether there is a requirement for two trucks to 
pass in the aisle.
The decision will also require the user to decide whether speed or storage 
capacity is the main driver.
The advantages and disadvantages of each type of racking system will be 
discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.
Other space
The amount of space set aside for packing, value-adding services and returns 
processing will depend on the level and type of activities envisaged within the 
operation, the number of staff and the type of equipment required.
An area that is regularly neglected when calculating space requirements in 
the warehouse is the area needed to store, recharge and change batteries or gas 
canisters for forklifts, a parking area for equipment when not in use, an area 
for storing empty pallets and packaging and an area for ancillary equipment 
such as stretch wrap machines, pallet inverters, etc.
Office and restroom space will be determined by the number of employees 
required within the warehouse.

Finally we need to ensure that we have sufficient space outside the building 
for the following:
●
●to park vehicles which are either collecting or delivering products;
●
●own fleet vehicles (if applicable);
●
●sufficient turning circle for the largest vehicle;
●
●waste storage and recycling areas;
●
●areas for weather resistant packaging;
●
●parking for staff and visitor cars; and
●
●gas or diesel storage tanks depending on the type of MHE utilized.
Warehouse layout examples
The warehouse layout will very much depend on the size and shape of the 
building, access to it, type of equipment utilized and the operation envisaged. 
As discussed in the section on picking, there is no ‘silver bullet’ warehouse 
layout; however, certain operations lend themselves to specific layouts. For 
example, parcel and pallet sortation centres tend to favour the through-flow 
warehouse as depicted in Figure 9.5.
The most popular warehouse layout tends to be the U-flow shape.
Figure 9.4 shows how receiving and despatch are on the same side of the 
building thus ensuring high dock utilization and facilitating cross docking. The 
fastest-moving items are closest to the despatch bay, thus ensuring minimum 
travel and the opportunity to combine put-away and retrieval. In this example 
reserve storage is held above the actual carton-pick locations.
The design will be heavily influenced by the type of pick operations within 
the warehouse, with separate areas set aside for unit pick and value-adding 
services. This area could, for example, be housed on a mezzanine floor above 
the receiving and despatch bays.
If the warehouse operation has a high incidence of picking and value-adding 
activities then any low height areas within the warehouses should be set aside 
for these activities or, as previously mentioned, mezzanine floors constructed 
either on one or two levels depending on the requirement and the height and 
cube available.
A through-flow warehouse as depicted in Figure 9.5 provides a layout where 
the movement is in straight lines and is more natural. Each layout has its 
advantages and disadvantages. The U-flow design enables greater utilization of 
the loading bays but can result in congestion if both areas are busy at the same 
time. It also makes security easier and access is via one side of the warehouse

only. With a through-flow warehouse there are no issues with congestion but 
travel distances are increased and having doors on both sides of the warehouse 
requires increased security and access either via two separate external gates or 
a perimeter road around the outside of the warehouse.
Having access on more than one side of the warehouse will also restrict 
future expansion.
The increase in multimodal use will also have an impact on future ware-
house design with access required for trainload traffic within the warehouse or 
at least under a canopy at one end of the warehouse.
Finding additional space
When facing a shortage of space within the warehouse there are a number of 
options available, namely:
●
●expanding the warehouse;
●
●renting additional space; and
●
●creating more space within the existing premises.
If the company is unwilling or cannot afford to rent external space and is 
unable to expand the existing warehouse or make significant structural changes 
there are ways of increasing the number of storage locations without major 
upheavals.
Figure 9.6

Warehouse Management
218
A potential solution to increasing available space within a warehouse is to 
reduce inventory levels. Unfortunately, this tends to be beyond the remit of the 
warehouse manager. However, warehouse managers can identify slow and 
non-moving stock with a view to disposing of it in agreement with the sales 
and finance departments.
Although it may sound strange to suggest looking within the existing 
facility, there are options that might have been overlooked. Some potential 
options are as follows:
●
●Change the type of storage medium or mechanical handling equipment 
used. This can include changing from single-deep to double-deep racks, 
utilizing drive-in racking, narrow aisle racking or introducing articulated 
forklift trucks which can operate in narrower aisles.
●
●Consolidation of stock. Unless stock items have different best-before 
codes, batch numbers or expiry dates it is worth checking how many 
part pallets there are of certain items and spending time consolidating 
them. This does require the use of labour but the trade-off is between 
the freeing up of additional space and this cost. The alternative is renting 
space at a third-party warehouse. Some warehouse systems allow the 
storage of different products in the same location. This will require 
careful planning and additional training.
●
●Reducing beam heights within the warehouse to accommodate smaller, 
full or part pallets. How many times have you entered a warehouse to 
see half metre high pallets in 2 metre high locations, not including pick 
locations, of course? Many warehouses prefer to have standard-height 
pallet locations as it is easier to manage and control and is more 
pleasing on the eye. However, the potential for optimum space 
utilization is lost.
●
●As the majority of warehouses operate with adjustable pallet racking 
the most cost-effective method of storage is to have variable height 
locations. These will accommodate 0.5 metre, 1 metre, 1.2 metre,  
1.5 metre and 2 metre pallet heights, for example.
●
●Moving from fixed locations to random locations. In a warehouse with 
fixed locations the same product is always held in the same location, 
irrespective of quantity. With fixed locations if an item is out of stock 
you cannot use that location for anything else.
●
●If there is sufficient space in the yard a temporary storage structure may 
be the answer or the use of sea containers or trailers. Security and the 
potential for water damage are areas that need to be considered before 
embarking on such a solution.

Warehouse Layout
219
Summary and conclusion
An efficient warehouse layout should reduce the amount of travel and labour 
touch points. It needs to avoid bottlenecks and cross traffic where feasible and 
ensure that movements take place in a logical sequence.
The whole cube of the building should be utilized and not just the floor 
space. The introduction of mezzanine floors and carousels provides excellent 
cube utilization where floor space is at a premium. The trade-off here is cubic 
utilization versus potentially slower retrieval times.
There are many opportunities to release additional space within the ware-
house – we just need to look harder and ask more questions.

Introduction
In this chapter we examine the different types of storage systems and manual 
handling equipment used in warehousing today. Although warehouses should 
all be about throughput, the transfer of manufacturing offshore by many 
countries has necessitated an increase in storage requirements.
Counterbalance forklift trucks have been around for over 90 years and 
we are now seeing significant technological advances with laser-guided trucks, 
articulated trucks, hybrid trucks and high-lift, very narrow aisle (VNA) trucks.
Storage equipment
There are many different forms of racking systems available on the market 
today. Each one performs a different role and its use will very much depend on 
the type of operation envisaged.
In terms of storage systems we come across another warehouse trade-off. 
The trade-off here is between speed, cost and capacity.
The greater the storage an operation requires, the greater the density of 
pallet storage needed. The potential option in these circumstances includes the 
introduction of drive-in, double-deep, satellite or very narrow aisle racking.

Storage and Handling Equipment
221
The trade-off is the fact that these systems take longer to access and de-
posit pallets and may require specific handling equipment or a different type  
of racking. Wide aisle adjustable pallet racking on the other hand takes up 
more floor space but products are easier and quicker to access.
There are many different types of pallet racking configurations currently in 
use today. These include the following:
●
●wide aisle adjustable pallet racking;
●
●double-deep pallet racking;
●
●narrow aisle racking;
●
●very narrow aisle racking;
●
●AS/RS racking;
●
●dynamic or pallet-flow racking;
●
●push-back racking;
●
●drive-in racking;
●
●drive-through racking;
●
●mobile racking;
●
●cantilever racking; and
●
●shuttle racking.
There is of course no right answer to the type of storage medium that should be 
used. Put five consultants in a room with stock data, ask them to come up with 
the optimum storage medium and you are likely to get six different answers.
The type of storage will depend on the configuration of the building, the 
type of MHE currently in use and the budget available.
In a 2008 UK warehousing benchmarking study by Cranfield University the 
types of pallet storage systems utilized by the respondents to the questionnaire 
were as shown in Figure 10.1.
Interestingly, even with today’s modern warehouse, the most popular forms 
of storage recorded for this group of companies surveyed are floor storage and 
standard wide aisle racking.
Each storage medium has its advantages and disadvantages as shown below.
Storage options
Block stacking
In circumstances where the warehouse height is reasonably low, where products 
and packaging are robust and budgets are tight, this type of storage is the most

common method of storing large quantities of single SKU products. The goods 
are packed in unit loads, and stacked on the floor to their maximum safe height, 
which is governed by the weight and stability of the stack. This method is also 
used where products do not lend themselves easily to palletization and pallet 
racking is out of the question.
Typical products stored in this way include white goods such as washing 
machines and refrigerators, kegs and barrels, cans and bottles.
Other storage media include metal stillages used for storing automotive 
parts and pallet boxes, for example. Block stacking is a cheap way to store 
robust products where there are a large number of units per SKU.
There are a number of disadvantages associated with block stacking. These 
include:

●Access. Sufficient space needs to be allocated for forklift trucks to  
access each stack. Also, in order to access the bottom pallet you need  
to move the pallets above.
●
●Damage. The items at the bottom can be crushed by the weight of  
the items above. Care needs to be taken with the number of unit  
loads stacked on top of each other. Items such as white goods have  
a maximum number indicated on the packaging.
●
●Stock rotation. Unless product can be accessed at both ends of the  
stack, items can only be despatched on a LIFO (last in, first out) basis.

●
●Space utilization. Utilization can be very poor if stock does not move 
quickly through the warehouse. Picking stock from either the front  
or the rear of the stack can lead to unusable storage areas being left; 
this is sometimes known as honeycombing. Cubic utilization also tends 
to be poor when block stacking items where the clear height of the 
warehouse is significantly higher than the stack itself as can be seen in 
Figure 10.2.
The use of pallet collars and converters can reduce the potential 
damage to underlying pallets and increase the stack height. The  
wooden, plastic or steel surrounds take the weight of the stacked  
pallets as opposed to the product itself. Those with drop-down front 
gates can enable some picking activities to take place. There is also no 
requirement to stretch wrap these pallets.
As can be seen from Figure 10.2, the cube of the building is not used efficiently 
and once a stack has been picked from, you cannot put anything in front of 
that stack until all the cartons have been removed.
Racked storage
The terms adjustable pallet racking (APR) and wide aisle racking (WAR) are 
seen as interchangeable. One point to note here is that APR is also used in 
narrow aisle construction. In this section we will discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages of the types of racking used in today’s warehouses.

Wide aisle or selective pallet racking
This racking is present in the majority of warehouses worldwide. It is the most 
versatile of any racking without the need for any specialized handling equip-
ment. The beam heights can be configured to any height as required.
The racking can also be configured to take pallets in either long side or short 
side configuration. One point to note here is that storing UK/industrial pallets 
(1200 × 1000), short side facing the aisle, means that euro pallets (1200 × 800) 
can also be stored in the same location without the use of decking.
Every pallet is accessible at any time and the racking is easy to install and,  
if necessary, move. Access is also quick and easy compared with most other 
types of racking.
As the description suggests, the disadvantage is in the fact that wider aisles 
are required to allow the forklift trucks sufficient turning circle. The use of 
reach trucks in this area reduces the amount of aisle width required compared 
with counterbalance trucks.
The introduction of articulated forklift trucks has further reduced the 
requirement for wide aisles.
One point to note here is whether you require the option of having two 
trucks operating in the aisle at the same time. If this is the case, aisles will need 
to be at least the width of both trucks plus clearance.
Double-deep racking
Double-deep pallet racking, as the name implies, allows pallets to be stored two 
deep in the racking thus eliminating an aisle. The pallets are still accessible 
from the same aisle. This system does require specialist equipment in the form 
of extendable forks and will require slightly wider aisles. Speed of access is 
slower. A further point to note is that the products on the pallets need to be  
the same otherwise the front pallet will need to be removed to access the rear 
pallet. LIFO applies.
By reducing the number of access aisles and using the space saved to accom-
modate additional racking, a double-deep configuration provides a highly 
space-efficient storage system.
Narrow aisle racking
Narrow aisle racking, as the name implies, utilizes APR and provides storage for 
a greater concentration of pallets by reducing the aisle width to circa 1.6 metres. 
This type of racking configuration requires the use of narrow aisle or turret 
trucks to deposit and access pallets. These trucks are not required to turn in the 
aisles as their forks extend from the side. They are able to access pallets from 
both sides of the aisle.

The trucks are manoeuvred within the aisles via wire-guided systems or guide 
rails. Narrow aisle racking requires a very flat floor, especially if we are looking 
at heights in excess of 10 metres. During construction, companies will use lasers 
to ensure the flatness of the floor.
The use of guide rails prevents the use of powered pallet trucks in this area to 
pick up and deposit pallets in the pick face as they are unable to access the pallets.
Narrowing the aisles too much restricts the speeds at which a forklift can 
travel between picking locations.
The use of articulated trucks in narrower aisle racking means that similar 
aisle widths can be achieved but without the need for wire-guided systems or 
guide rails and a perfectly flat floor.
Drive-in/drive-through racking
Drive-in racking provides a safe and efficient equivalent to block stacking for 
loads that are too fragile or unstable to be stacked on top of each other. In 
place of the longitudinal beams that usually support the pallet and load on 
conventional racking, each upright of drive-through racking has an L-shaped 
rail for the pallets to rest on, between which there is enough space for a forklift 
truck to drive into the racking. The rails are carried on brackets that slot into 
the uprights. The pallets have to be stronger than for normal racking because 
they have to support the weight of the load across the gap between the rails.
With drive-in racking there is no requirement for aisles, therefore floor 
space is fully utilized. Cubic space utilization will depend on the lifting height 
capability of the forklift truck.
Drive-in racking does not allow for first in, first out (FIFO); however, drive-
through racking does enable you to extract pallets from the other end of the 
racking. This does reduce the amount of storage space available, however, and 
also adds to the honeycomb effect as discussed previously.
Drive-in/drive-through racking is a high-density storage medium suitable 
for large quantities of single SKUs. Note that products cannot be mixed in each 
row and stock counting can be very difficult.
Its disadvantages are the increased potential for damage, not only to the 
product but also to the racking, and the low speed of put-away and retrieval.
This type of storage relies on full-pallet picks in the main as there is no scope 
for carton picking from the ground-floor locations.
This type of racking can be used at the despatch area to stage outgoing 
pallets by truck, reducing the amount of floor space required in this area.
Pallet flow/live storage
Pallet-flow racking is driven by gravity. It is perfect for fast-moving product 
with FIFO stock rotation. Pallets are loaded at the upper end of sloping lanes, 

Storage and Handling Equipment
227
and move down by gravity, using heavy-duty skate wheels, when a pallet is 
removed from the pick face. One block of roller conveyor racking requires 
only two aisles: a loading face and a picking face, which means fast cycle times 
and high occupancy rates within your warehouse. Warehouse floor space util­
ization can be further maximized with fewer aisles by storing pallets back to 
back. Disadvantages are the potential reduction in cubic utilization and the 
fact that different products will require a different angle of incline based on 
the weight of the pallet. Each run also requires the same product to be stored 
in it.
Push-back racking
Push-back systems work by placing pallet loads on a series of nesting carts 
fed forward by gravity on rigid structural steel rails. As a pallet is loaded from 
the front, it pushes the pallet behind it back one position. When unloading, 
the front pallet is removed and the rear pallets automatically come forward 
to the front picking position. This allows for easily accessible LIFO inventory 
management.

Operators can store product from two to five pallets deep, with front-only 
loading from a single aisle. Push back offers more versatile storage than drive-
in rack because each lane flows independently and vertical storage operates 
separately from the lanes below. Multiple pick facings for a variety of SKUs can 
be stored and retrieved without disturbing other product above or below in a 
single-lane or double-lane format (Unarcomaterialhandling.com).

Mobile racking
Where floor space is very expensive, a warehouse can be made very compact if 
the units of racking are movable by being mounted on rollers. Only enough 
space for one access aisle is then required, as the operator can ‘move’ the aisle 
merely by moving the units (by power, by hand wheel or by pushing) to create 
a way through to a particular bay. But here, of course, floor space is being 
saved at the expense of a slowing down in the load-retrieving operation.

Satellite or shuttle racking
A recent entrant into the pallet storage market is satellite racking. A satellite 
system is similar to drive-in racking. However, it is operated by placing shuttles 
at the front of the racking, utilizing counterbalance, reach or narrow aisle trucks, 

Warehouse Management
230
depending on the height of the racking. The shuttles are controlled remotely 
via a radio frequency (RF) battery-operated control system and special channel 
rails. There are no aisles and therefore the cube of the warehouse is well utilized, 
with the use of very long lanes. The storage system can store pallets within a 
system that can operate to lengths of 40 metres.
The racking features guide/support rails that run the depth of the rack struc-
ture on which an automated shuttle travels. Pallets are loaded onto a shuttle at 
the front of the lane, which transports the pallet down to the other end. The 
built-in sensors on the shuttle detect the position of existing pallets and place 
the new load at a predetermined distance, before returning to the start face. 
The shuttle is easily moved between lanes by the forklift truck. Multiple shuttles 
can be controlled by one forklift truck.
Unlike drive-in racking, there is no necessity for the truck to enter the racking 
and therefore the potential for damage is minimized and the truck can carry on 
with other duties while the shuttle places the pallet in the correct location.
The system operates in first in, last out mode, allowing racking to be set up 
against a wall of a warehouse, thereby gaining space. It can also operate with 
FIFO, using a system that offers separate entrances and exits. This method 
allows for the loading to be done from one side with a forklift truck and the 
unloading on the opposite side with another. The system automates the place-
ment of pallets in the storage lane, reducing loading and unloading cycle times.
Each level of racking is assigned to a specific product, unlike drive-in racking 
where every level has to contain the same product code.
Satellite racking can also utilize the space above the loading bays. As can be 
seen in Figure 10.9, the pallets are stored on a LIFO basis in this instance. This 
area can be used for marshalling loads prior to despatch.

This racking can also provide picking areas as they do not require a forklift 
truck to enter the area.
Examples of shuttle racking and satellite racking are shown in Figures 10.9 
and 10.10.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JuQjwARtaQ
Shuttle technology with a difference
Taking shuttle technology one step further is Retrotech’s Activ system.
Their patented technology works like a large sliding puzzle with multiple 
layers. Pallets input at one end are deposited onto cable-driven carts that slide 
along deep storage lanes. The software automatically places loads into optimal 
positions based on the order patterns. The difference being that pallets can 
move both horizontally and vertically thus overcoming the need to have the 
same product in each lane.
The ACTIV System can buffer, sort, and stage palletized unit loads in exact 
loading sequence. Fast movers are more accessible and slow movers are posi-
tioned out of the way, so loads can be staged and sequenced for trailer loading 
– 24 hours a day.

Activ users have reported the following:
●
●truck wait times reduced 80 per cent;
●
●80 per cent reduction in warehouse space (five sites consolidated  
into one);
●
●customer service level performances of 99.5 per cent; and
●
●extensive flexibility to accommodate future business needs and 
unanticipated changes.
As can be seen in Figure 10.11 the density of storage is excellent.
As a result of its high-density capability LiDestri Foods were able to absorb 
24 hours’ worth of production, eliminate two outside storage facilities and 
consolidate all operations into their manufacturing facility.

Very high bay warehouses
These consist essentially of massive blocks of racking, built as an integral 
structure to a high degree of precision, and often acting as a support for the

building’s roofing and wall cladding. Warehouse heights can range from 23 metres 
up to 60 metres. Mast cranes built into the racking structure operate in aisles 
little wider than the unit load handled, under computer control, with the unit 
loads moving automatically into or out of the racking.
The costs are high, but so are space utilization and operating efficiency, and 
there is little doubt that more of these warehouses will be built to handle and 
provide quick access to goods where the range of products is wide and stock 
turnover is high.
A typical example is the Quinn Glass High Bay Warehouse constructed by 
Stöcklin, which is 35 metres high and has a footprint of 52,200 square metres. 
It has the capacity to store 280,000 industrial pallets.
Table 10.1 details each type of storage medium and compares it with its rivals, 
based on a number of parameters.
There are of course many variables that will impact on the price. The main 
one being pallet size and type and, for example with drive-in racking, there are 
different design options and alternative support rails available. On double-deep 
racking it would normally be the use of APR but some trucks require a low-
level beam to accommodate reach legs which would increase the price and 
VNA operational costs will fluctuate depending on the guidance system used.
In terms of special MHE required we mean anything other than a counter-
balance or reach truck. Comparison data is supplied by Redirack.

floor locations within a given space in a warehouse based on the type of racking 
utilized.

Mezzanine floors/raised storage areas
Where a warehouse has sufficient height it can be very cost effective to construct 
a mezzanine floor. Typical areas are above the inbound and outbound loading 
bays. This space can be used to construct shelving for storage and can also be 
used to undertake value-adding services or can be used for long-term storage.
If the mezzanine is to be used for product storage, you’ll need to ensure it’s 
properly structured to take the appropriate load, and that the supports are also 
properly specified. The floor that the vertical supports stand on will also need 
to be properly surveyed.
To gain access to your mezzanine you’ll need to consider whether you need 
a lift, conveyor, steps and any gating or barriers that will be required. For ex-
ample, if you need to load pallets on to the mezzanine, you’ll need access for 
your forklifts.
According to Acorn Warehouse Solutions a mezzanine floor can cost appro­
ximately £5.00 per square foot to construct. This needs to be compared to moving 
to a larger warehouse and the costs that will incur.

Summary
The choice of storage medium very much depends on the type of operation 
envisaged and whether storage or throughput is the driving factor.
The decision as to which storage medium to choose also has to take into 
account the type of MHE required to access the racking. The different types of 
equipment will be discussed in the next section.
Warehouse handling equipment
The challenges of a 24/7 operations culture, together with an ageing workforce, 
demands for improved accuracy, shorter lead times and a reduction in cost 
have galvanized manufacturers into producing handling systems that require 
minimal manual input and provide increased throughput levels.
This section reviews equipment currently in use from the humble pallet jack 
through to robotic systems. It examines some of the enhancements that have 
taken place recently and provides comparisons between different types of 
handling equipment within the warehouse.
The key principles of materials handling are as follows:
●
●continuous movement is most economic;
●
●economy is directly proportional to size of load;
●
●standardization reduces costs;
●
●mechanization improves efficiency;
●
●gravity is cheap; and
●
●simplicity is the goal.
In choosing the correct equipment we are looking to:
●
●lower unit materials handling costs;
●
●reduce handling time;
●
●conserve floor space;
●
●prevent injuries to staff; and
●
●reduce energy consumption.
It is essential to consider all aspects of an operation in order to ensure that the 
most suitable equipment is specified and the best handling solution selected.
Important factors include:
●
●the load and the means of transfer, eg type of pallet;
●
●type of storage;

Warehouse Management
240
●
●type of operation;
●
●warehouse dimensions (height and travel distances);
●
●overhead obstructions;
●
●surfaces and gradients;
●
●working area; and
●
●environment.
To be able to decide on how to equip our warehouses with the most efficient 
mechanical handling equipment we need to undertake the following:
●
●define the functions to be performed;
●
●review all stock items and define their handling requirements;
●
●understand the travel distance and speed relationship;
●
●understand the limits of the building and the structures within it;
●
●evaluate staff capabilities; and
●
●evaluate vendors, equipment alternatives and relative costs.
Horizontal movement
Examples of horizontal movement equipment include the following:
●
●hand pallet trucks (HPTs), pallet jacks;
●
●powered pallet trucks (PPTs);
●
●tractors/tugs;
●
●automated guided vehicles (AGVs); and
●
●conveyors.
Hand pallet trucks
An HPT has a hydraulic pump to enable the operator to lift a pallet sufficiently 
to be able to move it across the warehouse floor. It is a cost-effective piece 
of equipment to move pallets across short distances. It can also be used to 
manoeuvre pallets within the racking or on the back of a trailer or container.
Powered pallet trucks
These are battery operated and are used for loading, unloading, picking and 
pallet-transfer duties to and from the receiving and despatch areas. They can be 
supplied as pedestrian, stand-on or seated versions.

Storage and Handling Equipment
241
The choice of truck will depend on pallet throughput per hour and distances 
travelled within the warehouse.
Tow tractors/tugs
These are utilized where distances between points within the warehouse are 
long and there is a requirement to move a number of pallets at the same time. 
Pallets can be loaded onto trailers coupled to each other and towed or trammed 
to the required location.
Automated guided vehicles
The use of automated guided vehicles is growing in popularity as companies 
struggle with a shortage of skilled labour, high labour costs and 24/7 opera-
tional requirements. Couple this with a reduction in cost and AGVs become a 
feasible alternative to man and machine for moving pallets horizontally 
throughout the warehouse and for loading and unloading palletized vehicles.
These AGVs can be wire guided, magnetic or gyroscopic. They can also use 
cameras to record their movements and then memorize them for the next trip.
A recent innovation has been the laser-guided truck. Using special reflective 
surfaces placed throughout the facility, the automated laser-guided vehicle 
continuously checks its position and path as it is controlled by the WMS.
By combining voice picking with laser-guided trucks, productivity increases 
can be up to 80 per cent, with a typical ROI of two years.
There is no requirement for the picker to collect pallets or take completed 
picks to the despatch area. Once a pallet is full, it automatically travels to the 
transfer point at the end of the aisle. While this is happening, another AGV is 
already bringing a new, empty pallet from the store, so that the picker’s actual 
job – picking – is not interrupted. Automatic guided vehicles carry the full 
pallets to a stretch wrapper, where it is wrapped in foil, ready for despatch. The 
system sends all the essential despatch information to an integrated printer, 
which then prints this data onto a label attached to the finished pallet.
Customers using this system are reporting not only a doubling of the pick 
rate to some 400 packages per hour, but also a 60 per cent lower error rate. 
Another advantage of this solution is that the picking pallet can always be 
adjusted to the ergonomically optimum loading height for the picker.
Additional advantages include the automated transport of picked pallets on 
to despatch. Each of these factors contributes to a quick return on investment.
The advantages of automated vehicles are as follows:
●
●computer or hand controlled;
●
●more durable than people;

Warehouse Management
242
●
●long-distance and/or high-density traffic;
●
●fitted with security sensors and guards;
●
●limited potential for damage;
●
●reliable; and
●
●do not cause bottlenecks.
The disadvantages are that they are initially expensive, fully reliant on the 
RF system within the warehouse and may require a specially designed and 
obstruction-free floor area.

Vertical and horizontal movement
In order to take advantage of the cubic capacity of a building, pallets or unit 
loads need to be lifted into position. Forklift trucks are differentiated by their 
lift-height capability, weight capacity and turning circle. These trucks have 
become a great deal more sophisticated with onboard computer screens and 
cameras, as can be seen in Figure 10.18.

These trucks are used for moving pallets around the warehouse and when 
required can lift pallets up to 5 metres. They can be pedestrian, ride-on, stand-in 
or seated.
Case study 
Asda Walmart has recently introduced the pedestrian operated mini Bendi into their 
back of store operations.
As a business, Asda constantly looks at ways to separate pedestrians and forklift 
trucks in order to minimize the risk of accidental collisions. However when segregated 
it can often lead to cube productivity inefficiencies. With the new truck they no longer 
need to compromise. Simon Grass of Asda comments:
The Mini Bendi allows us to significantly drive the use of the cube in our back of house 
areas as it can work in the narrow aisle format and maximise the usable height available 
but due to its way of working that allows us to have pedestrian pick within the same 
area permitting the stores to drop and fill effectively. This supports the reduction in the 
building footprint and thus improves the buildings selling efficiency as we can either 
build a smaller store or increase the selling sq ft. It also allows us to lower the height of 
the building as we can now store as many pallets above ‘pedestrian pick’ in narrow 
aisles, as we could in the reach truck aisles at height, which is especially welcomed by 
the local planning authorities in certain areas of the country.
Counterbalance forklift trucks (CBT)
CBTs are the most common trucks to be found in a warehouse. They are fast, 
flexible and versatile, but the major disadvantage is that in order to stack or 
retrieve a pallet they must approach the face of the pallet at 90° square. Thus 
the turning circle of the truck determines the minimum aisle width.
They are powered by diesel, battery, LPG or CNG. They can operate inside 
and outside the warehouse.
CBTs can carry palletized goods to and from racks up to 7 metres high and 
require aisles of 3.5 metres or more in width. They have been the workhorse of 
the warehouse for over 60 years because of their flexibility in being able to 
work both inside and outside the warehouse.
To increase storage capacity by making better use of the floor space available it 
is possible to reduce aisle widths by utilizing different types of trucks.

Reach trucks
These trucks are ideal for working within narrower aisles. Unlike the CBT they 
carry the load within the wheelbase. They are able to work in aisles of around 
2.7 metres. However, most companies will increase the aisle width to 3 metres. 
They have a maximum lift height of up to 12 metres. They can operate in single 
and double-deep racking environments. As can be seen in Figure 10.21 the aisle 
is reasonably narrow, but not as narrow as those operated within by articulated 
and very narrow aisle trucks.
Narrow aisle or turret trucks
These trucks are designed to operate with little more aisle space than their own 
width. The normal width of a narrow aisle truck is approximately 1.6 metres. 
Operating this type of truck can add approximately 33 per cent to storage cap­
acity through the adoption of narrower aisles.

There are disadvantages, however:
●
●The use of man-up VNA trucks requires large transfer gangways at  
both ends of each aisle to allow these trucks to switch aisles – unless,  
of course, you have the luxury of operating one truck per aisle.
●
●Furthermore, there are safety issues associated with picking because 
reaching out from a fixed cab to pick a carton and place it on a pallet 
some distance away is not ergonomic or efficient.
●
●A man-up VNA truck operator who is working 10 metres in the air  
will often struggle to notice another order picker working at ground 
level in the same aisle, thereby compromising order-picking efficiency 
and health and safety within sites where there is a high degree of 
low-level order picking. This can be overcome by insisting that no truck 
is allowed in the aisle when picking is taking place, although this isn’t 
the most efficient use of resources.

●
●Man-down trucks can, to a degree, overcome the safety problem; 
however, these aren’t as efficient with no capability of picking cartons 
from height and retrieval, and put-away can take longer.
A recent innovation is Junheinrich’s Warehouse Navigation System for Narrow 
Aisle Trucks. The narrow aisle truck continually feeds back its location via trans-
ponders in the floor of the warehouse. Orders received from the warehouse 
management system are transmitted to the truck’s radio data terminal. The 
terminal’s logistics interface translates and passes on this information directly 
to the truck controller (not the driver). This means the truck knows the exact 
destination to approach. The driver simply has to give the travel/lift command 
and the truck approaches the pallet location automatically in diagonal travel.
The advantages are as follows:
●
●efficiency increased by up to 25 per cent;
●
●alleviates driver stress;
●
●automatic responses without scanning;
●
●preventing incorrect put-away and retrieval; and
●
●less damage on the racking.

Articulated forklift trucks (Flexi, Bendi, Aisle Master)
The introduction of articulated trucks has overcome a number of issues, 
including the flexibility of being able to operate the same forklift truck inside 
and outside the warehouse. However, these trucks are akin to a well-known 
yeast extract product – you either love them or you hate them; there doesn’t 
appear to be any centre ground. Training can potentially take longer than for 
an equivalent truck and put-away and retrieval times will vary depending on 
the ability of the driver. Bendi are confident that their trucks can produce 
increased productivity figures in similar aisle widths to a VNA truck.
Until the articulated truck was introduced, companies had little alternative 
but to operate a two-truck system with a counterbalanced truck working  
outside and feeding a reach truck inside the warehouse. With the arrival of 
articulated trucks, users can eliminate this often costly and generally inefficient 
arrangement. Articulated forklift trucks load and unload vehicles and deliver 
pallets directly to the racking in a single operation. By doing so, they increase 
efficiency and productivity while abolishing double handling and the costs 
associated with running a larger truck fleet than is necessary.

The truck manufacturers argue that during a typical work cycle over a one-
hour period a reach truck will move 25 pallets; over the same time and doing 
the same job, an articulated forklift can potentially move up to 35 pallets, 
according to John Maguire of Narrow Aisle Flexi Limited.
CASE STUDY 
Narrow Aisle Flexi
The international automotive supplier Brose has been using Flexi Euro articulated 
trucks in their JIS factory supplying Mercedes in Sindelfingen since August 2008. 
These trucks are suitable for very narrow aisles and have created more space in their 
existing line side warehouse.

The products produced at the Brose factory are door systems for the Mercedes S, 
C and E ranges.
A further order for a new Mercedes range as well as the increasing production 
depth urged manager Jan Francke, who is responsible for the two Brose factories in 
Sindelfingen and Rastatt, to react early enough. An external canopy for the factory in 
Sindelfingen for storing empties had already been planned when head of logistics  
at the Sindelfingen factory, Dana Mühlenhof, came across the concept of the Flexi 
articulated forklift trucks.
Narrow Aisle Flexi had recently adapted its truck for the market in Germany. The 
main advantages of the British-designed Flexi Euro forklift trucks are that they can 
work in an aisle width of only two metres at a capacity of up to two tonnes.
With two Flexis, Brose has replaced two standard forklifts whilst their tests 
showed they would have required at least three reach-type trucks due to the slow 
mast movements.
The reach truck had been dismissed because of its width and low productivity. ‘If 
we used conventional reach trucks we would have had to increase the distance 
between the pallets and consequently would have lost too much space,’ explains 
Dana Mühlenhof.
Since August 2008 Brose has been using two Flexi Euro trucks. In fact, the only 
disadvantage of these Flexi trucks is their comparatively lower speed compared 
with counterbalance forklifts. ‘Due to this we have calculated additional time of  
5 per cent, which is in fact much better than the reach truck tested,’ says Jan 
Francke. This 5 per cent, however, has to be seen in relation to the longer distances 
which would have needed to be travelled, resulting from an expansion of the 
warehouse. ‘By using Flexi we could keep our optimized material flow in the 
factory,’ emphasized Mühlenhof.
The Flexi Euro is unique in that it was developed especially for customers in 
Germany who need to handle the Euro Alliance pallet in a 2-metre aisle without the 
extra cost of guidance systems or special floors and conform to the aisle security 
standards DIN15185 Part 2 required in Germany.
Thanks to the efficiency of the new Flexi Euro trucks, Brose could create a very 
compact storage layout at the factory in Sindelfingen. The remodelling of the storage 
racks was done simultaneously with the introduction of the new trucks. ‘Instead of an 
aisle width of 4 metres we are now mainly working with a distance of only 2 metres,’ 
says Francke.

Automated storage and retrieval systems 
(AS/RS)
This system utilizes fixed path cranes to collect pallets at the front of the racking 
system and transport them to empty locations within the racking. In order to 
improve productivity, the system collects a full pallet from the racking and 
deposits it at the front of the aisle prior to collecting another pallet. This dual-
command system or task interleaving is very efficient. The crane can travel 
horizontally and vertically simultaneously, thus reducing travel time between 
pick up and put down.
The cranes will normally remain in one aisle. However, where storage 
requirements are relatively high and throughput relatively low, the cranes can 
be transferred from one aisle to another using transfer cars.
The racking can be one deep or potentially two deep, necessitating retract-
able forks. To fully automate the process, pallets are collected by AGVs and 
taken to the despatch area.

Table 10.2 provides data to enable the reader to compare the different pallet 
movement trucks.
The aisle width quoted is the minimum requirement. Any operation that has 
more than one truck operating in an aisle at the same time will require wider 
access.

Specialized equipment
Not all unit loads can be moved or picked up by standard pallet forks. There 
are a number of operations and products stored within a warehouse which 
require specialized handling equipment.
Examples of additional equipment are as follows:
●
●extended forks: used for retrieval from double-deep racking and for the 
movement of large pallets;
●
●crane attachment: used for picking up heavy bags, etc;
●
●boom attachment: used for picking up loads with a central coil,  
eg tyres, carpets;
●
●drum grip and clamps: used for moving drums and barrels;
●
●load clamps: used for moving or tilting items;
●
●carton clamps: used for lifting or moving large boxes or white goods;
●
●rotating paper roll clamps: used for moving and lifting paper reels;
●
●double pallet handlers: ability to move two pallets at the same time;
●
●slip sheet attachments: load push/pull mechanism for moving product 
from a slip sheet onto a pallet.
●
●side loading trucks for longer loads (see Figure 10.24).

Recent technical advances
Forklift truck manufacturers are continually looking to introduce new techno­
logy to enhance the capabilities of their forklift trucks.
Jungheinrich recently introduced a new automated pallet scanning and 
identification solution that is an integral part of the forklift truck and brings 
considerable time and efficiency advantages to the supply chain.
The new fork-based scanning process not only results in significant time 
savings compared with manual scanning, but reduces the forklift driver’s 
workload and ensures low picking error rates.
With pressure from the environmental sector and a need to reduce energy 
consumption within the warehouse, manufacturers are also looking to alter­
native energy sources. These include the introduction of hybrid vehicles and 
fuel cells that are used to power lift trucks in high-throughput warehouse 
applications. Hydrogen fuel cells can offer higher productivity in electric lift 
trucks because they can be rapidly refuelled by operators, eliminating the 
need to change, store and maintain batteries. Plus, fuel cells produce constant 
voltage, which means there is no battery drop towards the end of a shift.
A number of trucks are also able to return charge to their batteries through 
regenerative lifting and braking.

Summary and conclusion
The choice of equipment very much depends on the product characteristics, the 
warehouse dimensions and environment, the required velocity of the product 
through the warehouse and the available budget.
Technology within MHE is fast moving and although the counterbalance 
truck remains popular even after all these years it is also being adapted to keep 
up with these advances.
The majority of mechanical handling and storage equipment manufacturers 
have sophisticated systems including simulation software that are able to assist 
companies with their decision as to what type of racking and MHE will efficiently 
suit their operation. This service is normally free and although a potential sale 
is the goal, so is a satisfied customer.

Resourcing  
a warehouse
DAVID CAIRNS AND GWYNNE RICHARDS
The devil is in the detail. 
(Anonymous)
Introduction
Having examined both people and equipment within the warehouse, we now 
turn our attention to how much of these resources we require to operate  
efficiently.
The types of resource found in a warehouse are numerous and will include 
operatives, equipment, consumables, general supplies, etc. In this section  
the focus will be on the two main types generally associated with warehouse  
operations – labour and equipment.
These are generally acknowledged as key, as under-resourcing will usually 
mean failure to meet service requirements, while over-resourcing will mean 
failure to meet financial performance targets. However, while other resource 
types may appear less significant, the effects of inaccurate ordering of con-
sumables can be equally dramatic – for example, running out of stretch-wrap 
may contribute to damaged goods in transit, while no labels to print can result 
in a loss of ability to track product through a warehouse, and potentially an 
inability to fulfil orders.
Resources can be categorized by the principal driver of requirements; there 
are two main categories: determined by level of processing activities; and deter-
mined by other factors.

255

Warehouse Management
256
Processing activities
Processing activities will generally involve handling product and will generate 
‘multiples’ of resource, for example receiving product into a warehouse.  
By contrast, a good example of a resource whose level is determined by other 
factors is site security, where manning is likely to be determined by warehouse 
operating hours.
There is no absolute definition as to how to categorize resources, but a good 
guideline for ‘processing activity’ resources is one where a small change in  
activity level will change the level of resources employed.
For example, Figure 11.1 illustrates the activity of put-away (of pallets to 
racked storage). This is a processing activity: the units measured are pallets 
over a set time period, the work rate (productivity) is the time taken to identify 
and collect a pallet, transport it and lift it into its storage slot, confirm the put-
away (in this case a barcode scan is assumed) and return to the start location 
for the next put-away task.
The time for this single put-away cycle can be expressed as pallets per hour 
(or as minutes per pallet) and the division of the productivity rate into the  
activity level generates a number of hours for the task in the given time period. 
See Table 11.1.
The example in Table 11.1 is based on a simple warehouse operation 
putting away 500 pallets per day. There are three put-away options for  
inbound product:
●
●into high-density storage (in this example drive-in racking);
●
●into standard wide aisle reserve slots (upper levels, above picking slots);
●
●into pick slots (ground-level wide aisle racking – small amount of 
product with no current stock).

Each has a different productivity standard to reflect the different nature of the 
task. To calculate the time for put-away into drive-in racking slots, the calcula-
tion of the workload for the day is:
300 pallets ÷ 16 pallets per hour = 18.75 hours
This activity utilizes an operative and a reach truck and therefore generates:
●
●18.75 operative hours; AND
●
●18.75 reach truck hours.
For this example it is assumed that reach trucks have a truck-mounted terminal 
and barcode scanner. If the operative uses voice technology, 18.75 hours of 
voice terminal use will also be generated.
When constructing a resource model there needs to be a balance between 
creating task lines for every element of work and recognizing where elements 
are interdependent and should be considered collectively. This process is differ-
ent from work study as it is driven by different considerations. For example, in 
the illustration above there is an element of direct put-away. This is intended 
for product which, when received, goes direct to the pick face for replenishment.
In this process it is assumed that the reach truck driver will include this 
process element in his daily work. Alternatively the driver could deliver the 
pallet to the front of the aisle and a second operative, using different equip-
ment, could be employed to place product into the pick face. This is illustrated 
in Table 11.2.
Note that in this example a second unit of measure has been added (cartons) 
along with two other pieces of equipment powered pallet truck and a hand-
held barcode scanner).
In both approaches we can see that each additional unit to be processed 
generates an incremental resource requirement.
Work rates (productivity)
A key element in the resource budget is the productivity rate. There are many 
ways to set productivity rates. Quantitative benchmarks can provide useful 
comparisons; however, no two warehouses are identical.
Productivity rates are driven by multiple factors and where significant 
change or a new warehouse is being considered it may be difficult to establish 
productivity rates accurately. The following three options are regularly em-
ployed to establish budget productivity rates:
●
●synthesis: composite construction of productivity rates for an activity 
from components of each work element;

●
●work study: preferably using an approved work study engineer and 
work measurement techniques;
●
●historical comparison: identification of productivity levels in existing 
operations and factoring in change elements.
The last option is probably the most accessible. It relates to an existing work 
profile and has a number of the inherent characteristics that drive productivity 
(hit rates, order composition, etc). If a key driver for a new warehouse is  
productivity improvement, then understanding and building from the existing 
process can help identify improvements.
Points to bear in mind are the size of the new warehouse and the likely in-
crease in travel time. If the new warehouse is significantly larger, performances 
may reduce as a result of longer travel distances within the warehouse. A 
change of equipment will also have an effect on productivities (for example 
moving from 1 to 2 pallet capacity picking trucks).
Comparison with available productivity benchmarks is useful, as is supplier 
data for envisaged equipment. When options have been reduced to a shortlist 
it is appropriate to invest time and cost by reviewing, in detail, these productiv-
ity rates to confirm assumptions and further refine and subsequently build con-
fidence in the rates.
Techniques such as simulation may also be appropriate at this stage, and 
may be particularly relevant where congestion is a factor in driving change. In 
an established situation there are often common effects. Generally, increased 
activity provides opportunities to improve productivity, through increased 
order sizes and picking full as opposed to part cases and pallets. However, 
growth can also result in bottlenecks and delays occurring while operatives  
are obliged to wait to carry out specific tasks. These delays, and related effects 
can be classed as ‘congestion’ effects. Figure 11.2 shows the typical combined 
influence of scale economies and congestion on work rates.
In practice the scale economy effect is generally easier to identify than the 
congestion effect. As a guide the scale economy effect will progressively flatten 
and an ‘optimum’ productivity rate may be achieved – the congestion effect, 
however, may materialize as minor or substantial deterioration of productivity. 
In these circumstances you need to identify the bottleneck and consider intro-
ducing processes to improve throughput. From a picking perspective multiple 
pick faces for the most popular product line is an example.
For resource modelling/budgeting purposes the work (productivity) rate 
required is one which reflects the actual time taken – this may be different to 
a rate developed by a work study engineer, where the rate may be an absolute 
rate which will have a performance factor applied to generate an expected 
level. Care should also be taken to make sure that matching assumptions are 
made about elements such as authorized and impromptu breaks, collection of 

Resourcing a Warehouse
261
equipment, on the job training, and changes in equipment. This is particu-
larly relevant when considering start up scenarios or introduction of signifi-
cant numbers of new employees, when productivity may build progressively 
to target.
When constructing a resource budget the primary aim is to produce output 
that can be used to set resource levels and feed into the financial budget to 
forecast costs. However, other applications include providing a basis for manag-
ing ongoing operations, to assist in activity costing, and, for some operations, 
constructing charging mechanisms.
The process is subject to ‘the law of diminishing returns’; the effort needed 
to develop and interpret detailed budget information for smaller elements may 
not justify the end result; for basic warehousing operations a rule of thumb 
would be that when more than 80 per cent of total time can be calculated by 
quantifiable activities then the effort required to further develop the model is 
unlikely to be justifiable; for costing or charging applications, a higher percentage 
may be required.
In basic warehouse operations there are a number of core processes: receiv-
ing, put-away, retrieval, picking, replenishment and despatch. In most ware-
houses these will account for over 80 per cent of the handling (touch points), 
and most use of mechanical handling equipment. Specific applications, notably 
the growth of e-commerce, may include packing and value-adding services as 
substantial core processes.

In a standard manual warehouse where the majority of goods are picked as 
cases, the largest component in the resource budget is likely to be case picking, 
which will often account for more than 50 per cent of direct operator hours.  
In e-commerce applications, where the unit of handling is likely to be a single 
sales item, the picking and packing elements combined will account for a 
higher proportion of labour hours.
Seasonality/demand variation
A fundamental characteristic of most businesses is that demand is variable. 
There is a need to model variations in demand to understand how the resource 
requirements will change.
The key to developing an effective resource plan and budget lies in under-
standing when specific warehousing activities are likely to occur. There are 
three main sources of variance in demands on a warehouse:
●
●Seasonal variations through the course of a year. These range from 
clearly recognized seasonal demands, such as barbecues in summer,  
to variations influenced by general purchasing behaviour.
●
●Variations during the course of a week. These are typically influenced  
by sales patterns of customers and associated buying processes; for 
example, there may be a surge in orders following sales at the weekend 
or, by contrast, a push to meet projected sales through promotions.
●
●Variations during the course of a day. This is most obvious when 
considering order placement on the warehouse. Many service businesses 
will seek to place orders up to close of normal trading for next-day 
delivery – in these instances the warehouse is unlikely to see complete 
scheduled orders until late afternoon for despatch by the beginning of 
the next working day.
Activity profiles generated during data gathering or from existing trading pat-
terns should provide a good indication. In many operations there are predict-
able changes in operating profiles at peak periods – there may be larger order 
sizes and a tradition of a longer working day/week; in these circumstances it 
may be appropriate to model ‘peak’ activity alongside ‘average’. Figure 11.3 
below is drawn from a live warehousing situation and illustrates through the 
year variation.
The columns in Figure 11.3 represent order lines and units illustrating vari-
ations in profile composition as well as activity. In this instance there was 
launch (promotional) activity in February, followed by selling pushes in May 
and July with a more sustained peak towards the end of the year. The average 
is 8.3 per cent per month; even with allowances for diseconomies of scale in 

Resourcing a Warehouse
263
productivity, resourcing this profile will need to address a substantially lower 
need for resource in the first half of the year.
Resource modelling
An illustrative example has been used to demonstrate typical modelling tech-
niques. The following profile applies:
●
●Single stand-alone warehouse (ambient goods).
●
●Incoming product received on pallets (side-loaded vehicles) and 
containers (loose loaded).
●
●Storage is palletized (standard wide aisle Adjustable Pallet Rack + 
Drive-In Pallet rack).
●
●Core business is carton/pallet pick, palletized despatch on tailgate 
loaded vehicles.
●
●Additional area for support activities such as relabeling, promotional 
packing, export preparation (Value Add 1). (Product is processed and 
returned to warehouse stock).
●
●Additional area for e-commerce business providing unit pick-and-pack 
for internet customers (B2C). Despatch as parcels through carriers.
Four levels of activity are defined – average (24 weeks), low (18 weeks, includ-
ing some with no working on public holidays); these 42 weeks traditionally 
operate as five-day weeks, while the remaining higher activity periods – high 
and peak (five weeks each) operate six days to meet increased demand.

In this example two profiles have been modelled – for average and peak 
levels of activity – and low and high levels are extrapolated from these core 
profiles. Usually the modelling process begins with producing either an aver-
aged figure (say an average day or week), however an alternative option is a 
typical day/week – where a typical day represents what happens on most days 
of the year, but is not necessarily the average. This is often appropriate where 
there is a prolonged or pronounced peak as found with seasonal products.
 The main activities within the warehouse, with associated productivities 
and volumes for average and peak profiles, are shown in Table 11.3.
The model generates summary information for labour and each equipment 
type, and includes data summarizing activity level. In this illustration the  
modelling will be taken forward using data summarized by area of activity  
and by equipment used, however there is the means to include further variation 
using this source, for example if modelling variable mix between intake and 
despatch, which would reflect a stock build ahead of a peak period.
There is an important need to establish the relationship between the data 
used in modelling and the total volume (measure of activity) that the resource 
budget covers. This will typically be one year, and at various points in the mod-
elling process it is advisable to undertake a reconciliation, by multiplying each 
model activity element by the number of relevant days/weeks and summing to 
generate a (annual) total that the modelling caters for. This can also be achieved 
by including a data line that generates a common figure, eg number of cases 
affected by the components.
The next stage of modelling addresses the second variation category – day-to-
day seasonality. In many businesses, profiles will emerge that show different levels 
of activity on different days of the week, with businesses serving fast-moving 
retail outlets likely to exhibit demand patterns that will reflect purchasing 
behaviour. The precise effect can vary if a business pulls stock (ie replenishes 
sales made) or pushes stock (pre-empting anticipated sales), with busiest days 
(for a warehouse) likely to occur after or before the busiest sales day, depend-
ing on method of supply. Note that for e-commerce the relationship is more 
directly linked to customer demand, with warehouse activity patterns closer to 
the pull model.
In practice, goods receipt is likely to follow a different profile from that  
of despatch in a stockholding operation, so it is recommended to determine 
different daily profiles for discrete aspects of the warehouse operation. In the 
example, the main warehouse operations are split into palletized receipt, loose 
receipt, despatch and other activities, reflecting circumstances in which palletized 
receipt may be determined by production running times, while loose receipt 
reflects shipping and container transfer constraints. Figure 11.4 shows a graphic 
representation of these categories. Table 11.4 shows the daily activity levels for 
the two value-add operations in the warehouse. In both areas it is possible that 
some activities may not be extended (to a sixth day) at peak.

The variance factors are then applied to the core resource model to generate 
daily resource requirements. The primary objective here is to gain an idea of 
overall requirements and extract a base from which to make judgements on 
setting resource levels. In the example, the scope of the modelling has been 
extended to include resource estimates for low and high periods.
It is possible to vary profiles further, and indeed vary productivity rates for 
different periods. For example, there may be periods of the year when case sizes 
vary and it is legitimate to amend the picking rate to reflect this. Similarly

productivity differences can also occur between different shifts. In practice, such 
additions will increase the complexity of the resource model, and care is necessary 
to ensure: the resulting model(s) allows for all aspects of its use to take place 
subsequently, eg KPI measurement and comparison; and the model does not 
become so complex that it loses practical application, including visibility to others.
Table 11.5 shows the application of period and daily variations to the main 
warehouse elements of the model at workgroup level. Similar information is 
available at individual activity level, and for each day of low/high period (one 
day shown as illustration).
The table illustrates the varying requirement for resource through the course 
of the year. For the main warehousing operations the average daily requirement 
is 376.4 hours (direct labour), varying between 351.7 and 405.9 during the 
week; at peak the average daily figure rises to 454.7 hours, with a peak daily 
requirement of 507.0 hours. This implies peak days are around 20 per cent 
busier than average. However, the weekly requirement rises from 1,882 hours 
(average) to 2,728 hours at peak, almost 50 per cent; this statistic effectively 
affirms the logic of extending to a sixth day at peak and illustrates the nature 
of decision guidance that follows from careful resource planning.
Peaks and troughs of activity precipitate changes to the resources required 
in the warehouse. Just as there are times when additional resources are re-
quired and decisions need to be made on how to meet these needs (eg overtime, 
equipment hire, etc), there will also be occasions when there may be insufficient 
work to occupy core resources in the operation (idle time).
The approach can be applied to other elements of the operation, such as the 
value-add operations, and for equipment requirements.
In essence the model progressively reflects the key concept of variability in 
resource planning. The final step to introduce is to look at the process of deter-
mining the actual levels of resource required. This invokes the third source of 
variability – at what times during the day is resource required.

Resourcing a Warehouse
269
As an example consider despatches, which, in turn, largely determines picking. 
In many warehouses it is common to find that intake is biased to mornings to 
allow clear use of loading areas for despatch later in the day. In turn demand is 
placed by customers through the (office) day, with many orders being placed or 
finalized by a ‘cut-off’ time for next-day delivery. In many cases such deliveries 
need to be loaded and en route by early morning to meet deli­very schedules 
and, in essence, the warehouse window for picking and despatch is concen-
trated into the afternoon and evening.
UK retailer Next has recently extended its latest order cut off time to 10 pm 
for next-day delivery.
The total workload (in the example) justifies a two-shift operation and, 
whilst flexibility of labour allows manpower to switch tasks, some equipment 
is very specific in its use. In the example there are 191 hours/day of case pick 
on an average day (210 hours on busiest day) during an average week.
This activity – the only one to use low-level order picking trucks – takes 
place primarily on the late shift as there is limited work available in morning. 
Despatch must be completed by the end of the day, resulting in 80 per cent of 
activity occurring during the second shift.
In this example the requirement for order picking trucks (LLOPs) is four 
times higher in the afternoon than in the morning; the modelling needs to  
reflect this, as using a daily average will lead to a serious shortfall in equipment. 
In the example this is achieved by allocating a proportion of each task to time 
windows (shift) in the working day.
Shorter time windows may be more appropriate for other operations. As the 
critical requirement is likely to occur on the busiest day, it is usual to use this 
requirement to determine equipment needs. In the example this is day 4, for 
both average and peak weeks, but it should be noted that for some equipment 
types the day may vary.
Table 11.6 shows the allocation of hours to shifts, and the subsequent  
derived numbers for equipment – this is based on the greatest required number 
over each of the shifts, and assumes availability of 7.16 hours/shift (to match 
operators’ availability after break allowances are taken into account).
The model in Table 11.6 has generated an estimate of the number of working 
pieces of equipment at average and peak periods. This is a guide to managers 
who are responsible for setting resource levels (equipment and labour) and 
requires full interpretation to finalize. This process should be more of a fine 
tuning effort and will take into account elements such as availability (after 
maintenance/repair), ability to obtain short-term hires and a practical perspective. 
For example, the requirement for two counterbalance trucks may be viewed  
as marginal so that no further provision for maintenance spares is needed  
(particularly if ‘emergency’ hire is readily available). However the requirement 
for 24 LLOPs may translate into 27 to cover repairs and maintenance based on

experience (plus five seasonal hires). These judgements will be determined  
by factors such as history and availability of equipment and will generally be 
specific to the equipment; it should be noted that the more specialized the 
equipment the more likely the requirement to carry peak and maintenance 
cover for the full year.
When calculating the base and supplementary levels of each type of resource 
there are no definitive rules. However, modelling techniques can be used to 
compare alternative scenarios. In our example this is achieved by manual input 
of different core levels of resource. Table 11.7 shows this for the calculation of 
labour resources, where inputs are used for the number of permanent (full-time) 
employees and a maximum proportion of hours worked as overtime. The model 
structure generates paid hours (at base rate) for the full permanent workforce, 
available hours (after allowances for planned and unplanned absence) and then 
identifies any idle hours (where less work is required than base hours available), 
overtime hours and temporary hours (generating overtime use first until the  
pre-set level is achieved, then overtime is capped and temporary labour used for 
remaining requirement). A contingency may also be factored in for unforeseen 
circumstances arising during day-to-day operations (in this model a contingency 
is identified for review purposes as an estimate of daily FTE (full-time equivalents) 
required). The complexity of the modelling process is directly proportional to 
the complexity being modelled, so modelling multiple shift lengths for example 
will increase intensity.
It may be prudent to review aspects of the resource calculations separately 
– for example if, historically, the warehouse management team had a view that 
it was difficult to obtain and/or manage more than 20 temporary employees 
effectively then a review of each day’s work content needs to take place. In this 
example this occurs on three days of peak week operations (over five weeks) 
and an appropriate strategy can be developed. This can either be formally in-
cluded in the model, informally added to the model or implemented outside the 
model, depending on the impact. For example, if a different spread of base 
hours, overtime and temporary hours through the peak week solves the prob-
lem, but makes no material change to the weekly totals it may be simpler to 
leave the model at the simpler level.
As previously noted it is likely that there will be some idle or unused time in 
the quietest periods. This is estimated in the output lines. In practice, particu-
larly for long-established operations, such idle time may effectively appear as  
a reduced productivity standard, ie the productivity standard has become a 
measure of work per attended hour. Care should be taken in understanding 
what the source information consists of, and therefore how it will model reality.
To assist in judging an appropriate resource level, weighted hours for the 
full budget are calculated. This is done by considering likely cost, and estimating 
this by weighting overtime and temporary hours relative to paid base hour.

Resourcing a Warehouse
273
The calculation includes time paid for absence as this will be a factor in the 
financial budget. Figure 11.5 illustrates different levels of permanent resource 
in the main warehouse for our example.
The graph, although specific to the example, illustrates some common 
features in resource modelling. The shape is typical with a ‘flat’ U-shape near 
the optimum number – in this case the difference is negligible between 57 and 
58 permanent employees. (Given these exclude contingency, which was esti-
mated as 1–2 operatives, the model would indicate 59–60 is the optimum level 
in this case). The increases in hours committed on either side of the optimum 
reflect common phenomena:
●
●a higher number of permanent staff will carry a penalty of higher idle 
hours,
●
●a lower number of permanent staff generates higher costs for overtime 
payments and temporary staff.
There is also a potential for lower productivity if excessive overtime is worked 
or large numbers of temporary staff are employed.
Model outputs can be tailored to financial budget inputs, but most of the 
core information is contained in this model – permanent staff, hours worked, 
overtime hours, temporary staff hours, equipment levels, equipment hire, etc.
It may not be necessary or appropriate to use such techniques for all  
resource types, illustrated by the two value-add examples.
Here value-add 1 covers bundling and re-labelling work and is expected to 
be a series of individual jobs. The resource model provides a broad estimate, 
but in practice each job will be an individual cost (or price) and there is likely 
to be more inherent variability.

For such circumstances it may be more appropriate to have a small core of 
staff, supplemented by temporary labour as required for individual jobs. For 
value add 2 there is more consistency in work content, but as this is a more 
volatile business stream then it may be appropriate to consider part-time em-
ployees whose hours can be increased at peak periods then supplemented by 
temporary resource.
Other factors
Other resource requirements are not driven by processing activity. These include 
resources that are determined by time cycles. Examples are clerical, administra-
tive and managerial staff, the equipment they use (system terminals, etc) and 
indirect activities for the operation as a whole, such as canteen staff and secu-
rity. For these resources there may be choices between direct provision and 
bought-in services. The touch-labour modelling will give a forecast of activity 
in terms of volume and numbers employed along with timings, from which 
judgements of levels of such resources can be made.
For example, an operations office will require manning whilst the operation 
is active, but numbers of personnel may vary according to type of activity. 
Factors such as the number of orders, type of paperwork (eg import/export 
documentation) will influence choice, and a key element will be the nature of 
the IT systems employed and the levels of manual intervention envisaged.
A voice picking operation should require less intervention than a paper-
based operation. It is also necessary to consider which functions are the re-
sponsibility of the warehouse. Security could be within the warehouse remit on 
a stand-alone site, but excluded if the warehouse is co-located with production 
or other company functions.
The scale of an operation will drive the management structure along with 
functional responsibility. Reference to historical arrangements can provide a 
good starting point as approaches vary significantly between organizations. 
This is particularly the case for first line management, where responsibilities 
can be incorporated as working supervisors or shared with team leaders.
In these cases some adjustments to the hours required for processing activity 
may therefore be required – in the example it is quite likely that this will apply 
in both value-add operations.
Resource modelling will also generate projected usage data that can be used 
to assist in the procurement process for new MHE, where lease/rental costs 
vary with use. Daily hours of use for equipment will help determine whether 
spare batteries are required.

275
Suppliers can also help advise on availability and cost of equipment hire 
during peak periods – in some instances this element can be incorporated into 
lease/long-term rental arrangements for the main fleet.
Summary and conclusion
Having built up the resource model, you are able to transfer this data into a 
financial budget and will be able to monitor the actual resource requirements 
and costs against those budgeted.
Productivity standards can also be compared with actual achievement and 
the resource model adjusted accordingly.
Finally, the model can assist you in estimating prices for goods and services 
as the model can be adapted to calculate not only the resource for the whole 
warehouse but specific operations or clients within it.

Introduction
The cost of operating a warehouse can average between 1 and 5 per cent of 
total sales depending on the type of company and the value of its goods. For 
example, a pallet of laptops will take up the same amount of space and the 
same amount of handling as a pallet of baked beans, yet the value of goods will 
be significantly different. Hence the variation in the percentage cost of sales. 
Warehousing also makes up around 22 per cent of a company’s total logistics 
costs with inventory carrying costs at a further 23 per cent.
As a result, warehouse managers require a comprehensive knowledge of all 
costs and cost drivers within the warehouse as they are under significant pres-
sure to reduce costs yet continue to produce optimum customer service with 
the added pressure of reduced inventory but increased numbers of SKU.
Managers are also expected to contribute data to the company budget  
and continually reassess the resource and cost budget in line with the actual 
operation.
This chapter looks at the typical costs within a warehouse and aims to assist 
managers in understanding these costs, enabling them to produce budgets,  
calculate return on investment for particular projects and use the information 
for decision making, evaluating performance, activity costing and, in the case 
of third-party logistics service providers, charging.
The chapter also compares traditional costing models with activity-based 
costing.
The chapter goes on to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of costing 
models such as open book, closed book and cost plus.

Warehouse Costs
277
Types of costs
The costs typically associated with a warehouse operation are shown below:
Space costs:
–– rent/leasing costs on building/land and building depreciation 
(depending on how the building and land has been acquired);
–– insurance;
–– rates or local government taxes;
–– utility and telecoms costs;
–– fixtures and fittings depreciation;
–– racking depreciation;
–– refrigeration plant depreciation;
–– repairs and maintenance;
–– cleaning, security, other building equipment depreciation;
–– waste disposal.
Direct labour costs (fixed): warehouse operators:
–– wages including on-costs;
–– personnel insurance;
–– safety wear (PPE);
–– welfare;
–– training.
Indirect labour costs (fixed): warehouse management including supervisors 
and administrators:
–– wages including on-costs;
–– insurance;
–– safety wear (PPE);
–– welfare;
–– training.
Labour costs (variable):
–– overtime, bonuses.
Equipment costs (fixed):
–– depreciation/lease costs/rental costs.

Warehouse Management
278
Equipment costs (variable):
–– running costs, eg fuel, tyres, lubricants, batteries;
–– packaging, pallets, stretch wrap.
Overhead costs (management, finance, human resources, IT and 
administration):
–– salaries and on-costs plus benefits in kind such as mobile phones, 
accommodation, etc;
–– company cars and running costs;
–– office equipment and furniture depreciation/lease/rental costs;
–– information technology costs (hardware and software).
Overhead costs (sales and marketing in 3PLs):
–– salaries and on-costs plus benefits in kind such as mobile phones, 
accommodation, etc;
–– company cars and running costs;
–– marketing spend, eg advertising, exhibitions, brochures, etc.
Miscellaneous costs:
–– communication costs;
–– postage;
–– bank charges and interest payments;
–– funding costs/cost of finance;
–– insurance;
–– legal and professional fees;
–– audit fees.
As well as wages and salaries, total labour costs include employer’s social  
contributions (including national insurance contributions (UK) and pensions, 
paid on behalf of the employee) and other non-wage costs including sickness, 
maternity and paternity costs, vocational training costs and recruitment costs 
plus any benefits in kind which might apply.
As can be seen in Figure 12.1, the costs can be built up to produce a total 
warehouse cost. Third-party logistics companies can add an element of profit 
in order to produce a costing model to charge clients. This model can be used 
in conjunction with the resource model in Chapter 11 to calculate activity rates 
such as handling costs per pallet and/or per case picked and cost per pallet 
stored.

Return on investment (ROI)
This is a measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to com-
pare a number of different investments. ROI is important to calculate because 
if an investment doesn’t have a positive ROI or if there are other opportunities 
with a higher ROI, then the investment should not be made.
The calculation of ROI percentage is as follows:
 (Gain from investment (or savings) – cost of investment) ÷ 
cost of investment × 100
A similar calculation is the payback period. This basically measures how long 
an investment takes to pay for itself. It does have drawbacks, however, as  
it does not properly take into account finance cost and opportunity cost, the 
latter being what must be given up (the next best alternative) as a result of the 
decision.
During a recent voice picking trial a client calculated that their ROI, by  
replacing barcode scan picking, was approximately 25.4 per cent in the first 
year with a payback period of nine and a half months.
The figures were as follows:
●
●pick productivity savings: £52,800;
●
●increased accuracy: £33,600;
●
●total savings: £86,400;
●
●investment in voice: £68,900;
●
●therefore (£86,400 – £68,900) ÷ £68,900 × 100 = 25.4 per cent;
●
●payback period = £68,900 ÷ £86,400 × 12 months = 9.6 months.
This isn’t a totally accurate picture as no account is taken of extra training 
costs, effect on the business during the early stages of implementation, etc.
However, this does give the company a reasonably accurate picture of the 
potential ROI for other similar investments.
Traditional versus activity-based costing 
systems
According to Themido et al (2000), companies in the past could keep unprofit-
able products and customers in the hope that one day they would become 
profitable, because the winners would more than compensate for the losers.  

Warehouse Costs
281
In today’s economy the margin for error is much smaller and pressures are  
increasing on companies to improve their bottom-line performance.
The knowledge of the real cost of a product or service and the cost to serve 
specific channels and customers is very important to a company in today’s 
competitive market.
Christopher (1998) states that logistics costing systems ‘should be capable 
of not only identifying the costs that result from providing customer services in 
the marketplace but also enabling separate cost and revenue analyses to be 
made by customer type and by market segment or distribution channel’.
Managers therefore need to be able to calculate the cost to serve for each 
customer and where possible the warehousing cost for each product.
From experience, smaller customers tend to be high maintenance. The 80/20 
rule can apply in these situations. The 80 per cent of customers generating 20 
per cent of the revenue tend to be the more demanding.
When I joined a third-party logistics shared-user operation I found that we 
had 29 clients in total. The total revenue generated from 20 of the customers 
came to less than 10 per cent of total sales. At the time we didn’t have the systems 
in place to calculate the profitability of each customer, but having evaluated 
each one in terms of future potential we decided to terminate the agreements 
of 19 of the customers and as a result we ended up with an increased profit 
margin.
In this section we will look at two types of costing system which are relevant 
to warehouse operations. These are the traditional costing method and activity-
based costing.
Traditional costing methods
Traditional costing models tend to allocate overhead costs arbitrarily. Table 12.1 
shows a typical warehouse cost structure.
In terms of storage, let us assume that our warehouse has 10,000 × 1.5 
metre high pallet locations. From a cost point of view each location costs 
£167.70 per annum. In order to allocate the overhead cost we need to add a 
further 24 per cent to this figure, which comes to a total cost of £207.95.
In terms of labour, if we assume total labour hours within the warehouse 
each year of 120,000 hours our labour cost is £10.00 per hour. By adding the 
overhead our cost comes to £12.40.
Taking this one step further, if we look at Customer A, who uses a large 
number of warehouse labour hours and space yet his pull on management 
time, for example, is low, he is penalized for the way the overhead costs have 
been allocated. See Table 12.2.
We will look at how shared-user warehouses can calculate storage and labour 
charges later in this chapter.

Warehouse Management
282
With the proliferation of products and service complexity, a single overhead 
rate is no longer sufficient.
In most cases overhead does not reduce as labour or equipment reduces. 
Therefore as volumes reduce, overhead as a percentage of direct costs actually 
increases.
Overhead rates are also based on predicted volumes or utilization and 
therefore as utilization reduces the percentage allocation of overhead needs to 
increase.

Warehouse Costs
283
For example, going back to our shared-user warehouse and Customer A, if 
he decides to reduce his stockholding and it is not replaced by another client, 
the charge per location needs to be increased. Based on a reduction of 500 pallets, 
his overhead contribution reduces by 2.7 per cent (£20,125), yet the overhead 
cost to the company is unlikely to reduce in the short term.
As can be seen, therefore, traditional costing methods have a number of 
weaknesses – which is why many companies are turning to other methods of 
costing. Activity-based costing is one of these methods.
Activity-based costing
According to Griful-Miquela (2001):
Activity-based costing systems are designed so that any costs that cannot be 
attributed directly to a product (or service) flow into the activities that make them 
necessary. The cost of each activity then flows to the product(s) (or service) that 
makes the activity necessary based on their respective consumption of that activity.
Activity-based costing looks to allocate indirect costs to processes in a way that 
accurately reflects how the costs are actually incurred. This is in contrast to 
traditional costing methods.
When looking to introduce an ABC model, you need to have a comprehen-
sive knowledge of the company, its operations and the roles of each of the staff 
members. This is normally carried out by observing the operation for a period 
of time and recording how long it takes for each activity.
A good guideline for selecting the cost drivers that most accurately reflect 
the cost of performing an activity is to ask the people who do that work what 
would increase or decrease the time and effort required to do their job. Table 12.3 
provides an example.
Once all the operational and overhead costs have been calculated and each 
customer’s pull on the services has been documented, companies can calculate 
the profitability of each client and see how they affect the cost structure of the 
business.
The overheads should be allocated based on the actual management time 
dedicated to each activity and customer. Cost of telephone calls, printing, etc 
should also be allocated on a usage basis for example.
This analysis of overheads is likely to be the most complicated to perform. 
This is the main difference between ABC and traditional methods, where in the 
latter overheads are allocated across all activities as a percentage of cost. With 
ABC it is necessary to carry out in-depth studies over a period of time in order 
to find the relationship between overheads, services and customers.
Once all of the activities have been evaluated and costs allocated to custom-
ers there is likely to be some unused capacity.

Warehouse Management
284
For example, a warehouse with a total capacity for storage of 10,000 pallets is 
not going to be 100 per cent occupied. Similarly, not all of the MHE and labour 
hours will be allocated to individual customers in totality.
It is therefore very useful to produce a table indicating the degree of utilization 
for all those areas.
These costs either need to be managed out of the operation through a reduc-
tion in labour and equipment, for example, or taken into account when initially 
quoting the customer or allocating to a particular product, or accepted in the 
short term as an inevitable cost and work towards increasing utilization or 
throughput to allocate these costs to a new product or client.
If all the costs incurred are allocated against individual customers this will 
increase the charges to those customers, which could result in lower sales and 
a further reduction in capacity utilization.
According to Griful-Miquela (2001), whenever unused capacity appears, it 
is necessary to analyse the reasons leading to this situation. Depending on the 
reasons, the actions to be undertaken may differ. For example, the degree of

unused capacity can be an indicator of how the employees are allocated 
among the different activities. It is possible to reallocate some of them with 
this information. For example, the in-handling team may have additional  
capacity and could therefore be allocated to replenishment or picking tasks.  
It is very important to analyse when a constraint appears. This might indicate 
the need for a new investment in the short term or risk being unable to cope 
with future requirements if no action is taken.
As previously discussed, a warehouse cannot operate efficiently if it is 100 per 
cent occupied, therefore there have to be some empty pallet locations. Similarly 
with labour, we have to take into account breaks during the working day.
Table 12.4 shows an example of an ABC model. We have calculated the 
number of pallet spaces occupied and number of labour and MHE hours  
allocated to each customer. We have also allocated the management time in 
hours per customer and allocated other overhead costs such as postage, legal 
expenses, insurance, etc on a percentage basis, based on the administrative 
hours.
The above hours can be further broken down into the individual activities 
within the warehouse and the costs allocated by customer. These costs can then 
be compared to the actual charges levied to the customer and any shortfall 
examined.
Having calculated all of the above, we are also able to see the amount of 
unused capacity within the warehouse.
The disadvantages of using ABC include the amount of work involved and 
difficulty in collecting accurate data. Implementation can take time and there 
needs to be a cost–benefit analysis in terms of the time taken and the benefits 
accrued.
Charging for shared-user warehouse services
A shared-user warehouse is one in which a third-party logistics provider stores 
on behalf of a number of different customers. They may be related in some way 
as suppliers to a particular retailer, for example, or competitors who have decided 
to come together to share resource and save on outbound distribution costs.
Examples of the latter include bicycle manufacturers in the Netherlands 
who saw the storage and handling of their products being specialized and 
potentially costly. Other warehouses can have very diverse clients. When  
operating a third-party warehouse in the 1990s we had three toy companies, 
a book publisher, a drinks manufacturer, two white goods manufacturers, a 
software company, a kitchen utensils manufacturer, a pet food manufacturer 
and a photographic film manufacturer.

Warehouse Costs
287
Products ranged from bulk block-stacked cans and bottles of beer, bulk 
block-stacked washing machines, pallets of cartons containing toys, kitchen 
utensils, cans of pet food and books and shelves of software titles.
So how do you charge these clients for the storage, handling and despatch 
of their products?
Shared-user warehouse customers are normally charged on an activity basis. 
Typical methods of charging are as follows.
Storage charges
Storage charge examples:
●
●rate per pallet per week;
●
●rate per item per week;
●
●rate per square foot per week;
●
●rate per cubic foot per week;
●
●rate per tonne per week;
●
●rate per shelf location per week; and
●
●fixed rental cost per week/month.
In the first six examples the rate is based on the unit of measure (UoM). This 
can cover clients who are storing pallets or items such as white goods which 
can be bulk block stacked, clients who require racked pallet storage or those 
who require smaller locations such as shelving or a combination of all three.
Calculating the total number of pallets to be charged per week can be done 
in a number of ways:
●
●the highest number of pallets in store during the week;
●
●the average number of pallets in stock per week;
●
●opening stock plus intake; and
●
●opening stock plus intake minus despatches.
In scenario 1 (Table 12.5) the charge will be for 200 pallets, this being the highest 
number in stock that week.
In scenario 2 the charge will be for 125 pallets, this being the average over 
the week.
In scenario 3 the charge will be for 400 pallets.
In scenario 4 the charge will be for 70 pallets.
Most companies will look for a minimum charge. In this example the mini-
mum charge is likely to be for 100 pallets.
In the case of a fixed rental cost per week or month, the client pays a fixed 
rate each week or month based on a previously agreed area or number of

UoMs. For example, a client may require an area of 1,000 square feet in which 
to store product and carry out some value-adding services.
If the client does not use the whole space they will still be charged the full 
rate. From the client’s point of view they are able to budget accurately each 
month. If the client exceeds the amount of space agreed they will pay an addi-
tional charge.
Handling charges
These are commonly known as RH&D charges, or receipt, handling and des-
patch. These are normally charged on a rate per pallet in-handled. Companies 
have to be careful here as this only covers full pallets handled in and handled 
out. If items are despatched as cartons an in-handling charge per pallet is nor-
mally used together with a rate per case despatched.
The costs are based on the amount of time calculated to undertake each 
movement plus the cost of the mechanical handling equipment utilized.
A typical example is shown in Table 12.6.
In terms of outhandling costs if it is the same full pallet we can use the same 
costs as above but in reverse. If the despatch is in cartons or individual items 
we need to calculate the amount of time it takes to pick and load an order.
For this rate we need to understand the customer’s outbound operation  
in terms of number of orders, lines and units per order, packing and labelling 
requirements.
The cost build-up will be as follows:
●
●Labour – time
–– collection of order;
–– travel time to each location;
–– pick time at each location;

Warehouse Costs
289
–– travel time to despatch area;
–– labelling and packing time;
–– checking time (if necessary);
–– loading time.
●
●Equipment – time
–– use of powered pallet truck;
–– contribution to voice technology;
●
●other;
–– packing and labelling materials;
–– supervisory and administration costs;
●
●overhead;
●
●profit.
Once calculated and divided by the average number of cases per order we 
should end up with a cost per unit outhandled.

Value-added services
These would normally be charged on an hourly basis until a cost per unit can 
be calculated taking into account the productivity, eg number of units labelled 
per hour. In this case you will also need to take into account the cost of the 
labels and allocate space and equipment costs to the charge. You need to factor 
in the cost of picking the products from their locations together with any ancil-
lary items and the transfer to and from the value-added services area. 
Supervisory costs should also be taken into account.
Logistics charging methods
In both internally and externally operated warehouses, costs need to be pre-
sented to customers – whether these are external customers or internal custom-
ers who have a cost attributed to their products.
As noted earlier, many businesses look at warehousing costs as a percentage 
of sales or production cost. In some instances costs are applied on this basis. 
This can be dangerous unless there is a safety net for the supplier. As through-
put and storage decline it is unlikely that the number of people required will be 
reduced at the same percentage rate. Also it is unlikely that the vacated space 
will be filled immediately. More often, though, costs are presented to the  
customer as an internal or external charge supported, to different degrees, by 
invoices and cost justifications.
The principles discussed earlier in this chapter identify the basis of justifying 
costs and charges for services supplied. In the case of third-party supply this 
will be in the form of invoices. The following sections describe how to con-
struct those invoices or cost allocations.
Open book
An open-book contract is based on total transparency between supplier and 
customer. The client is able to see exactly what costs the third party is incurring 
and is able to discuss these costs and potential cost-reduction strategies.
It is common in these types of contract to agree a management fee that is 
determined by performance. A base fee will be agreed together with set targets. 
If the targets are achieved, the management fee will be increased; if the third 
party falls short due to poor performance, they will forfeit some of their man-
agement fee.
This type of charging allows the client to become involved in the process 
and identify areas where its own performance can have an effect on the overall 

Warehouse Costs
291
cost. Within an internal process the product owner can identify which factors 
have an impact on the total product cost.
Cost-plus contracts
These contracts are similar to open book; however, in most cases the ‘plus’ ele-
ment is based on a percentage increase on cost. This can lead to the perverse 
situation where the higher the costs incurred on the contract, the higher the 
profit earned by the third party.
Cost-plus arrangements historically evolved to counter fears that fixed and 
variable rates masked true costs and allowed third-party providers to extract 
high profits. Cost plus took the first step towards identifying cost and setting 
(at the time) a ‘reasonable’ profit.
In these types of contract there need to be stringent targets and a commit-
ment to reduce overall costs. A gain-share agreement where both parties 
‘win’ when costs are reduced is a potential method of ensuring focus on cost 
reduction.
Closed-book contracts
In these types of contract, charges are based on the activities carried out by the 
third party as discussed above. The charges will include an element for over-
head contribution and profit margin.
As volumes increase, so will the total revenue earned by the third party. 
Conversely, as volumes reduce so will the third-party provider’s revenue.
With closed-book contracts customers get fixed, index-linked prices for 
given volumes and are unable to see the actual third-party costs. Third parties 
will look to cushion some of the fluctuations in volume by imposing minimum 
storage and throughput levels.
This type of charging has its advantages and disadvantages. The main ad-
vantage is that costs are closely related to sales in terms of order throughput. 
Storage costs are based on the number of items stored and therefore can high-
light when stock levels are higher than expected.
The main disadvantage is that it is more difficult to budget as costs will vary 
month by month depending on activities within the warehouse.
Secondly, rate reviews tend to occur annually and therefore do not reflect 
performance improvement as it occurs.

Warehouse Management
292
Hybrid
There are a number of different charging systems which can take elements of 
the above and combine them – for example, charges for fixed items such as 
property rental and IT assets may be paid for on an open-book basis while item 
throughput can be charged for on an activity basis.
Summary and conclusion
Warehouse managers require a comprehensive understanding of the costs that 
relate to their warehouse operation. This is not only to contribute to the com-
pany budget but also to enable the company to allocate costs to products or, 
in a third-party relationship, to charge for the services provided. It can also 
identify loss-making customers or products if we delve deeply enough into the 
figures.

Performance

What you do not measure, you cannot control.
(Tom Peters)
Introduction
In today’s economy it has been said that the customer is no longer king but 
dictator. With the proliferation of websites reviewing products and services it 
has become even more important to match or even exceed customer expectations 
in terms of quality and the service provided.
One example of poor service can far outweigh all of the times where deliveries 
were made on time and complete.
No longer can companies take an order and quote a 28-day delivery ser­
vice; in most cases delivery is expected next day and in some cases even on the 
same day.
The next point to note is that it is far cheaper to keep an existing customer 
than find a new customer. Therefore satisfying your current customer base is 
paramount.
Well-established research by Reichheld and Teal (2001) found that, for 
many companies, an increase of 5 per cent in customer retention can increase 
profits by 25 to 95 per cent. The same study found that it costs six to seven 
times more to gain a new customer than to keep an existing one.
From a warehouse perspective this means that you have to ensure accuracy, 
quality, timeliness and cost effectiveness within the processes you control.  
By doing this, you are contributing to a high-performance operation and as a 
result, contributing to customer satisfaction and retention.
As discussed previously, the warehouse operation is crucial in ensuring that 
the customer gets the right product at the right time and in the right condition.
This chapter looks at why we need to measure, what we need to measure 
and how we can use this information to improve our overall service to our 
customers.

Warehouse Management
294
Why do we need to measure?
There are a number of reasons why we need to measure performance and  
productivity within the warehouse. We measure because we need to:
●
●ensure customer satisfaction;
●
●ensure that there is a culture of continuous improvement within the 
operation;
●
●discover potential issues before they become major problems;
●
●train staff in the right areas; and
●
●reward staff where appropriate.
Unless we measure our performance against our customers’ expectations and 
continually improve on that performance, we are not only in danger of losing 
our customers but we will also incur additional costs.
For example, incorrect item or quantity of items sent will incur the following:
●
●Finance department is affected by delayed payments and possible 
penalties.
●
●Inventory department has to provide extra stock cover.
●
●Sales department has to handle complaints and authorize returns.
●
●Transport department has to effect extra deliveries and collections.
●
●Warehouse has to re-pick, re-pack and duplicate activities.
●
●Returns procedure has to take place.
●
●Possible product disposal/write-off.
●
●Review of processes needs to take place.
●
●Potential additional training required.
●
●Loss of product if client keeps the over-delivered product.
●
●Potential loss of customer.
What should we be measuring?
According to Ackerman (2003), we should be measuring four areas within the 
warehouse:
●
●reliability;
●
●flexibility;
●
●cost; and
●
●asset utilization.

Performance Management
295
Reliability includes on-time delivery, fill rates and accuracy. Order cycle time is 
probably the best measure of flexibility as it covers all aspects of the customer 
order process: how we handle the order initially, whether we have the stock 
available, how quickly we can process the order through the warehouse and, 
finally, how quickly we can deliver to the customer.
Cost measurements include cost as a percentage of sales and productivity 
against labour hours. Asset utilization will include efficient use of warehouse 
space, MHE, staff and storage equipment.
Warehouse utilization is normally measured in the amount of floor space 
utilized. However, it is more realistic to measure the cubic utilization of the 
building. Other companies will look at the number of pallet locations utilized 
against the total number of locations available.
Frazelle (2002) suggests that as occupancy rates exceed 86 per cent utiliza-
tion, productivity and safety decline exponentially with each percentage 
point increase in occupancy. He goes on to say that warehouses managed in 
real time might be able to operate at 90 per cent occupancy, although this is 
wholly dependent on the accuracy of the system and the experience of the 
warehouse team.
Third-party logistics companies will look to increase space utilization to the 
maximum as this is a revenue stream for them. However, productivity reduces 
significantly when space is at a premium. The coordination of pallets out and 
pallets in (in that order) is paramount, otherwise major bottlenecks appear.
In order to ensure that you provide your customers with the service they 
require, you need to understand your customers’ requirements both as a whole 
and individually and, secondly, the limitations you have within your company 
and operation.
Performance is a broad term that covers both overall economic and operational 
aspects. Slack et al (2001) offer the following description of high-performance 
operations that most companies strive to accomplish:
●
●High-quality operations don’t waste time or effort having to redo 
things, nor are their internal customers inconvenienced by flawed 
service.
●
●Fast operations ensure a quick turnaround of orders.
●
●Dependable operations can be relied on to deliver exactly as planned. 
This eliminates wasteful disruption and allows the other micro 
operations to operate efficiently.
●
●Flexible operations adapt to changing circumstances quickly and 
without disrupting the rest of the operation.
●
●Low-cost operations lead to higher profits as well as allowing the 
company to sell their products at a competitive price.

Warehouse Management
296
One of the main things to understand is that in terms of performance measures, 
you need to:
●
●monitor performance against the criteria that are important to your 
customers (delivery of the perfect order);
●
●monitor performance against the criteria that are important to you 
(costs).
As can be seen in Figure 13.1, different players have different ideas as to what 
is important in terms of performance measurement. The figure depicts which 
key performance indicators (KPIs) are important to a retailer and which are 
important to their third-party logistics service provider.
The best measures therefore are those that are aligned to and governed by 
customer expectations. However, they also need to be aligned to your company’s 
resources.
According to Rushton, Croucher and Baker (2010), there is a need to balance 
the level of customer service with the cost of providing that service. They go on 
to say that the cost of providing a given service is markedly higher the nearer 
it reaches the ‘perfect service’, that is, 100 per cent.

For example, 100 per cent next day, on time, in full may only be achieved by 
having sufficient inventory to satisfy every customer’s needs, and every order 
that leaves the building would need to be double or triple checked for accuracy.
They say that the cost of an increase in service from 95 per cent to 100 per 
cent will be far greater than an increase from 70 to 80 per cent, as can be seen 
in Figure 13.2. This may be anathema to certain companies and cultures where 
service is overriding and paramount; however, you have to be realistic and  
accept that 100 per cent on time in full every time is desirable but not always 
achievable.
Productivity is part of the overall performance umbrella: productivity out-
put such as goods and services produced in relation to inputs that include labour, 
finance, material and other resources.
Warehouse managers have a number of inputs and resources under their 
control including labour and MHE. The key to running an efficient warehouse 
is to make best use of these inputs.
The essence of productivity measurement is the recording and analysis of 
the time it takes to perform each handling movement within the warehouse. 
This seems a daunting task. However, if you are to continually improve the 
operation you need to be able to measure it accurately. Not only do you need 

Warehouse Management
298
to measure each activity but also measure it at different times of the day and 
undertaken by different people.
The task, of course, is much easier if you are using technology such as voice 
or radio data terminals, where the system can log start and finish times. As 
previously discussed, this technology can record all the movements and tasks 
performed by operators in the warehouse, providing reports that the ware-
house manager can use to assess and improve performance.
The example in Table 13.1 shows a typical manual record of work.
When measuring these activities you also need to take into account the  
following:
●
●preparation time (collecting, equipment, pallet, paperwork);
●
●human factors (skills, motivation, fatigue);
●
●mechanical factors (battery changing, attachment changes, refuelling); 
and
●
●operational factors (location system, product placement, congestion).
These can be a significant percentage of the time taken to undertake the task.

If you are a third-party operator you need to know how long it takes you to 
undertake the different tasks associated with the warehouse in order to quote 
and charge your customers accordingly. Chapter 12 looks at third-party ware-
housing and how to cost each activity.
The crucial factor in any form of productivity or performance measurement 
is to ensure the cooperation of staff.
The staff need to know how the measures are derived and why they are 
important. They must be made aware of the reasons behind the measurements, 
what the information will be used for and that they will also become benefici-
aries of an improved operation.
Finally, you need to decide whether the measures are individual or taken on 
a group basis.
To put Tom Peters’ remark, quoted at the head of this chapter, another way: 
you can’t manage what you can’t measure.
There are many areas within the warehouse where performance is key to the 
company’s well-being.
As mentioned previously, getting the right product to the right customer in 
the correct quantity and condition, on time and at a competitive price are key 
to retaining that customer.
How to choose the right performance 
measures
Each company will have different priorities, a different customer base and a 
different method of operation. In order to choose the most appropriate measure 
you need to undertake the following:
●
●Understand your business and its strategy.
●
●Decide on the objectives.
●
●Understand which KPIs are likely to assist in meeting the objectives.
●
●Align the KPIs to others within the company.
●
●Ensure that everyone works towards achieving the targets – nominate 
KPI owners.
●
●If targets aren’t achieved, analyse the reasons why and introduce 
processes to enable achievement.
●
●If the target isn’t realistic, replace it.
Vitasek (2004) developed a process that helps to establish department metrics 
that support the overall corporate objectives and links accountability to achieve

goals where the work gets done. It also creates an environment where employees 
use their metrics to drive positive change in the business.
For example, if the company goal is to reduce order lead time and improve 
accuracy the targets shown in Table 13.2 can be set for specific departments.
The first task in any performance measurement system is to understand the 
vision of the company and how your department can assist in achieving the 
company’s goals.
Too often department heads will produce key performance measures which 
they are comfortable with and which are easily achievable but are not aligned 
to the company’s vision and are rarely of interest to senior managers. 
Departments end up with too many measures which detract from the day-to-
day running of the operation.
The measures you choose need to be SMART. That is, they need to be:
●
●Specific. Objectives should specify what they want to achieve. Are they 
clear and unambiguous?
●
●Measurable. Can we put a value on the kpi? Eg How much, how long, 
how many?
●
●Achievable. Are the targets you set achievable and attainable?
●
●Relevant. Are the measures relevant to the overall goal and strategy of 
the company?
●
●Timely. Are the timescales realistic and how often do you measure?
You need to ensure that the data collected is accurate.
Moseley (2004) and Vitasek (2004) suggest that when introducing key per-
formance indicators you should:
●
●use terminology that your staff understand and is meaningful to them;
●
●understand what your staff need to do to improve service or reduce 
costs as identified by the KPIs;

●
●try to use common industry KPIs so that you can benchmark your own 
operation against your peers;
●
●review the data regularly and look for specific trends;
●
●not overreact to a particular data point;
●
●only introduce measures you know you can implement and measure;
●
●only introduce cost-effective metrics, ie ensure that it doesn’t cost you 
more to manage than the likely savings you make;
●
●only introduce measures you know you can change;
●
●not measure what you won’t or can’t change;
●
●be seen to be using the data; there is nothing more frustrating than 
collecting data which isn’t used.
Traditional productivity measures
There are many traditional productivity measures in use in today’s warehouses.
The first of these group measures are based on labour, space and equipment 
utilization:
Labour hours utilization
This measurement looks at the utilization of labour hours within the ware-
house based on the total number of labour hours available to work over a 
particular shift, day or even week. These hours should not include breaks.
The calculation is:
(Labour hours used × 100) ÷ labour hours available
Warehouse area utilization
This can be measured in a number of different ways. We can look at floor space 
utilization but more realistically we should measure the cubic capacity of the 
warehouse.
Alternatively we can measure the number of pallet locations utilized against 
the total possible locations.
The calculation is:
(Space used × 100) ÷ space available

Warehouse Management
302
For example, space utilization = 8,600 pallet spaces occupied ÷ 10,000 pallet 
spaces available = 86 per cent utilization.
If your warehouse has a number of different sections with racking in some 
areas and floor storage in others then a number of calculations will be required.
Note that you need to measure the space that can be specifically used for 
storage. Areas used for goods in, despatch, value-adding services, etc should 
not be included in your calculations.
Although improving space utilization is an important goal for any ware-
house, the key to improving overall warehouse productivity, that is space and 
labour, is to find the best compromise between storage utilization and handling 
efficiency.
MHE utilization
The calculation is:
(MHE hours used × 100) ÷ MHE hours available
The next group of measures looks at cost performance.
In financial terms, measures include cost as a percentage of sales and cost 
per order despatched.
These are calculated as follows:
Cost as a percentage of sales
The calculation is:
(Total warehousing cost × 100) ÷ total sales revenue
Cost per order despatched
The calculation is:
Total warehouse cost ÷ total number of orders shipped
The above performance cost measures need to be handled with care. Cheaper 
products despatched from the warehouse can result in a higher cost per order, 
which is not a reflection of increased costs in the warehouse but a strategic 
decision made by the company.
The third group is based on productivity measures:

Performance Management
303
Units picked per hour
The calculation is:
Units picked ÷ total hours available
The unit in this example can be an individual item, a carton or a pallet.
Dock-to-stock time
This is the time taken from arrival of vehicle on the receiving bay to visibility 
of stock on the system
The final group is based on customer service measures:
Order accuracy
The calculation is:
(Orders picked and despatched accurately × 100) ÷ total orders received
On-time shipments
The calculation is:
Orders delivered as per customers’ requests ÷ total orders received
In terms of performance measures, the 12 metrics most commonly used in dis-
tribution centres, according to a recent survey in the United States by WERC 
(2012), are as follows:
●
●on-time shipments (orders delivered as per customers’ requests);
●
●internal order cycle time;
●
●dock-to-stock cycle time in hours (time from stock arrival to available 
to pick);
●
●total order cycle time;
●
●order-picking accuracy (correct number of lines and units delivered);
●
●lines picked and shipped per hour;
●
●lines received and put-away per hour;
●
●percentage of suppliers’ orders received damage free;
●
●average warehouse capacity used;
●
●order fill rate (orders filled completely on first shipment);

Warehouse Management
304
●
●percentage of supplier orders received with correct documents; and
●
●peak warehouse capacity used.
A full list of warehouse performance measures will be included later together 
with actual metrics from the study.
New performance metrics
One of the most common measures in the United Kingdom today is OTIF (on 
time and in full).
This metric has been joined by the perfect order metric as the most popular 
customer service metric. This not only requires on time in full delivery but also 
the item has to be damage free, have the correct documentation and label and 
finally an accurate invoice.
In the following example all four metrics are measured individually and 
then multiplied together to produce the perfect order percentage:
On-time delivery = 97%
In full delivery = 98.5%
Damage free = 99.5%
Accurate documentation, labelling and invoicing = 98%
Therefore the perfect order metric is 97% × 98.5% × 99.5% × 98% = 93.2%.
In terms of OTIF, we get a result of 95.5% (97% × 98.5%).
Inventory measures
A warehouse manager is tasked with accounting for and measuring inventory 
but has limited influence on the level of inventory held in the warehouse. 
However, you may be asked to produce the following metrics.
Stock cover in days
This can be calculated by dividing the current level of stock by the total annual 
sales and multiplying by 365. This can be done using the actual number of 
units in stock or the value of the stock. This tells us how many days’ cover we 
have of stock.
For example, in Table 13.3 we can see that product code 99172100 has two 
and a half year’s worth of stock in the warehouse. On the other hand, product 
code 90152100 only has five days’ stock in the warehouse.

Performance Management
305
Stock turn
This can be calculated by dividing the total number of units sold by the average 
number of units in stock.
For example, in Table 13.3 product 90132100 has a stock turn of eight, 
which is reasonable, whereas product code 99172100 has a stock turn of 0.4, 
which means that the stock turns over less than once per annum – in fact once 
every 2.5 years.
These calculations can be used to determine stock ordering policy and also 
whether some stock should be returned to the manufacturer, disposed of, or a 
sales campaign organized.
The days’ stock figure should be aligned with the supplier lead time, the 
criticality of the item and the availability of the item from other sources.
As with many aspects of logistics, a balance needs to be reached between 
ensuring the maximum possible service and a minimum stockholding.
Stock/inventory accuracy
Another example of inventory measures includes stock accuracy. Whether 
stock is counted once, twice a year or daily by cycle counting or perpetual

inventory, stock accuracy is an important measure. The more accurate the 
stock the more likely you are to fulfil orders correctly and increase efficiency.
Measures include the following:
Location stock accuracy percentage = 
(number of correct locations ÷ number of locations counted) × 100
Stock line accuracy = 
(number of correct lines counted ÷ total no. of lines counted) × 100
Stock unit accuracy = 
(actual quantity by SKU ÷ expected quantity by SKU) × 100
Many companies compare the value of goods in the warehouse to book stock 
as a measure of stock accuracy.
Reporting a 100 per cent accurate stock count because the stock value is as 
expected and therefore ‘correct’ can hide a number of sins.
Surplus obsolete stock in the warehouse amounting to £10,000 with a cor-
responding shortfall of £10,000 worth of popular items, although potentially 
acceptable from a finance department viewpoint, can significantly affect the 
warehouse operation.
Accuracy by line and by location is therefore paramount for an efficient 
warehouse.
Damaged inventory
This measures the amount of damage caused within the warehouse. It can be 
measured by dividing the total number of damaged items by the total number 
of items processed through the warehouse. It can also be measured in monetary 
terms:
Damaged items percentage = 
items found damaged ÷ items despatched per month
Hard and soft measures
The above forms of measurement are referred to as hard measures. By this we 
mean they are relatively easy to measure, being quantifiable and less ambiguous.
Having been appointed customer services manager for a third-party ware-
house operator, I was constantly being told by our customers how poor our 
service was. I decided to introduce performance measures into the operation to 
enable us to either refute the customer claims or improve the service in the 
areas where we were failing.

Performance Management
307
We looked at which measures were important to our customers.
Once the measures were in place we were able to prove to our customers 
that our service was in line with the Service Level Agreements and reasonably 
in line with their expectations. The problem in the past was that customers 
only remembered the times when service was below standard. Once the meas-
ures were in place this changed the customers’ perceptions immediately.
Staff were tasked with producing key performance indicators for the areas 
which were important to our customers. These were discussed at monthly  
review meetings and any shortfall in service was examined in detail. This took 
the adversarial approach away from the meetings and both the good and bad 
performances were discussed and evaluated.
In contrast, soft measurements are those that deal with intangible attributes.
A typical example is customer satisfaction with accuracy of delivery when 
we ask the question – how are we doing? Soft measures are good at measuring 
perceived changes and will often provide a more complete picture of success 
compared with narrowly focused hard measures.
Soft measures are difficult, but not impossible, to define and measure. For 
example, a survey via a questionnaire can be used to assess several aspects of 
user satisfaction, for example on a scale of 1 to 10. The survey can be repeated 
at appropriate intervals to examine changes in perceived service.
Surveys can be used to improve service quality by asking customers to score 
service quality for the provider against a company thought to be excellent in its 
market.
Research by Landrum et al (2009) has shown reliability and responsiveness 
to be the most important contributing factors to service quality. Reliability factors 
include the following:
●
●providing services as promised;
●
●dependability in handling customers’ service problems;
●
●performing services right the first time;
●
●providing services at the promised time;
●
●maintaining error-free records.
As can be seen, these measures relate very closely to the perfect order metric.
Integrated performance models
Integrated performance models are a mix of actual performance data and cus-
tomer perception. The data is compiled from actual performance reports and 
from questionnaires sent to customers on a regular basis.

Warehouse Management
308
As can be seen from Table 13.4, each category is given a target rating and  
a weight of importance. This produces a target score by multiplying the two 
together.
An actual rating is also given based on the results of the survey and the  
actual performance, which in turn produces an actual score.
Areas which are underperforming against target are highlighted using the 
red, amber and green (RAG) model. The red areas are the ones which will  
require attention.

As can be seen from the table, perfect order completion is given a target rating 
of 5 out of 5, with the highest weighting of 50, giving a target score of 250.
The categories are chosen to reflect the vision of the company and need to 
be SMART.
In any form of performance measurement you need to ensure that your 
measures are aligned with your customers’ requirements and expectations. For 
example, 100 per cent despatch of what’s available from the warehouse is not 
always the same as the quantities ordered by the customer. The order may have 
been adjusted by the sales staff before it reached the warehouse.
Secondly, 24-hour despatch from order receipt at the warehouse may not be 
24 hours from the placement of the order. The order could have been delayed 
in customer services.
Benchmarking
This section looks at benchmarking and how it can assist you in your operation.
Benchmarking has been around since the early 19th century; however, it 
came to the fore in the 1980s when it was championed by Xerox Corporation.
It is a process of comparing performance with operations of other com­
panies, or operations within the same company, identifying high-performance 
or best-in-class operations and learning what it is they do that allows them to 
achieve that high level of performance.
Why should we benchmark?
Benchmarking enables us to:
●
●understand our own performance;
●
●identify any shortcomings;
●
●discover what others are doing better;
●
●identify performance targets that can be demonstrated to be achievable;
●
●accelerate and manage change;
●
●improve processes;
●
●understand what is best practice.
A word of caution. Benchmarking may point to best current practice but not 
to best possible practice. ‘As good as’ is not ‘better than’. It is not a substitute 
for creativity and innovation.

Warehouse Management
310
Benchmarking can be undertaken both internally and externally. There are 
a number of supply chain and logistics related benchmarking clubs. These  
include the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport’s Logmark, Asia’s 
Benchmarking Success, The Best Practice Club and the United States’ WERC, 
CSCR and DLMB Consortium.
In terms of external benchmarking you need to choose your partners care-
fully. To this end there are also industry-specific benchmarking surveys such as 
those produced by the Institute of Grocery Distribution for retailers.
As in performance measurement, there are pitfalls to avoid. Benchmarking 
should not be considered until you have an intimate knowledge of your own 
processes. Secondly, do not select processes to benchmark which don’t have 
sufficient potential for improvement.
The principles of benchmarking are as follows:
●
●collaboration;
●
●confidentiality;
●
●value;
●
●flexibility;
●
●honesty;
●
●openness; and
●
●reputation.
There is always likely to be a reluctance to share information with competitors. 
However, in order to produce meaningful results, honesty and openness are 
paramount.
One potential method of ensuring confidentiality and anonymity is to utilize 
a third party such as a benchmarking group, a consultancy or a university.
The example in Table 13.5 is from Mondeleˉz, who benchmark each of their 
distribution centres Europe-wide. All the centres work towards the same targets 
to enable a comparison across sites and ensure best practice is achieved.
There are eight major areas made up from 34 individual measures. Utilizing 
this benchmarking tool, the Mondeleˉz team is able to compare its own in-
house operations with that of their third-party logistics providers.

Balanced scorecard
The balanced scorecard, developed by Kaplan and Norton (1996), is another 
method of recording performance.
The scorecard looks at a number of dimensions which include finance, cus-
tomer satisfaction, internal processes and staff development and innovation.
Each measure will have objectives and targets which are measured against 
actual performance.
Introducing a balanced scorecard approach should result in better processes, 
a motivated team of people, increased customer satisfaction and improved 
communication.
As can be seen from the Mondeleˉz example, the warehouse operation will 
contribute to the overall company scorecard. The Mondeleˉz scorecard has  
specific sections on warehouse operations, inventory, quality, safety and the 
environment – all of which can be integrated with other departments operating 
within the company.
LTIFR = Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates

The performance metrics shown in Table 13.6 were elicited from WERC 
members and readers of DC Velocity in 2012. We have chosen our top 16 met-
rics with a cross section across customer satisfaction, supplier performance, 
accuracy, utilization, productivity and inventory measures.
The best in class figures are definitely targets to benchmark against however 
this will very much depend on the types of companies who replied to the sur-
vey. 92.2 per cent warehouse space utilization suggests a very slick operation 
with real-time technology at the forefront of operations.

Summary and conclusion
Measuring performance is key to running an efficient operation. However, the 
measures need to be SMART and aligned to the company’s strategic vision.
One important point to note is that traditional KPIs report on the status of 
an operation or step in a process at a particular point in time. They are useful 
in comparing performance over time, but situations change rapidly and targets 
and measures need to change in unison with the changing environment.
There are a large number of performance measures related to warehouse 
operations. However, you should only measure those areas which are important 
to your customers and to your company. Don’t measure just for the sake of it.
Being able to collect data is fine, but it’s what happens as a result of collect-
ing and analysing the data that is important.
These measures have to take you somewhere, as my friend Errol Matthews 
always says.

Outsourcing
BY KATE VITASEK, BILL DIBENEDETTO AND  
GWYNNE RICHARDS
Coming together is the beginning. Keeping together is progress. 
Working together is success.
(Henry Ford (1863–1947))
Introduction
Outsourcing is generally defined as working with a supplier to provide a func-
tion or service that isn’t a part of an organization’s core competence. In other 
words, as Peter Drucker says: ‘Do what you do best and outsource the rest!’ 
The essence is to take advantage of a specialist provider’s knowledge and econ-
omies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed, usually 
at a lower cost but not necessarily.
While Peter Drucker’s call for action sounds logical, are companies really 
using outsourcing as a key strategy to drive operational efficiency and improve 
effectiveness of their warehouse operations? There are various studies on the 
topic – but in general the answer is yes – companies are using outsourcing to a 
lesser or greater degree. A survey by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and 
Transport (CILT) in 2012 in the UK recorded that 61 per cent of their respondents 
outsourced part or all of their warehousing. In a 2013 survey conducted by 
Cap Gemini North America recorded the same figure with mainland Europe 
recording 72 per cent and the Asia Pacific region 59 per cent.
Companies that decide to outsource must ensure that any outsourced processes 
remain seamlessly integrated with the rest of the business and furthermore 
improve performance.

Outsourcing
317
In this chapter we discuss under what circumstances warehousing should be 
outsourced and examine the role of third-party operators in warehousing.
The outsourcing decision
The model by McIvor (2000), shown in Figure 14.1, provides a process com-
panies should adopt when deciding whether to outsource.
McIvor suggests the main areas that need to be assessed are whether the 
activity is core to the business, whether there are political considerations, 
whether potential cost savings are significant enough to make outsourcing viable 
and, finally, whether there are capable and compatible partners in the market.
Vitasek (2010) adds the dimension of whether or not a company has expertise 
or core competence in this area. Specifically, Vitasek recommends if a company 
has internal expertise that creates value for the company beyond what the 
‘market’ can provide – the work should remain in-house while companies that 
do not have the expertise should consider outsourcing as a viable option. In the 
Capgemini survey (2013) the five top reasons for companies not outsourcing 
were as follows:
●
●logistics is a core competence within the company;
●
●cost reduction would not be experienced;
●
●logistics is too important to consider outsourcing;
●
●service level commitments will not be realized; and
●
●corporate philosophy excludes outsourcing.
The reasons for outsourcing are many, as shown in the CILT surveys from 
2011 and 2012 surveys in Table 14.1. Interestingly these are very similar to the 
reasons for retaining business in house – access to expertise, cost reduction and 
service improvement.
As seen in Table 14.1, a shift has occurred from cost the major factor for out-
sourcing to access to greater expertise. The top four reasons remain the same, 
although in a slightly different order.
The need to reduce capital expenditure is up to fourth which is indicative of 
the economic climate.
Any outsourcing decision should be based on the following:
●
●the suitability of the activity outsourced;
●
●the profile and culture of the potential supplier;
●
●impact of outsourcing on the remaining business; and
●
●all costs and risks.

Warehouse Management
320
Before looking at the reasons for outsourcing in more depth, consider the scale 
of the warehouse operation that is likely to be outsourced.
In the majority of cases where the scale of the warehouse does not warrant 
a dedicated operation and where the warehouse is not adjacent to a manufac-
turing facility, companies should seriously consider using a shared-user or public 
warehouse.
This enables companies to benefit from economies of scale by sharing re-
sources and assets, increasing resource capability with no workforce increases, 
while benefiting from industry advances in technology.
We will now look at the main reasons cited for outsourcing warehousing 
operations in a bit more depth.
Core activity/core competence
There is some confusion over these phrases in relation to warehouse operations. 
Warehousing in the majority of companies is regarded as core to the business. 
However, it may not be a core competence and therefore becomes a likely can-
didate for outsourcing.
As discussed previously, warehouses play a major role in providing the ultimate 
in customer service by delivering the right product to the right place at the right 
time in excellent condition, and at an acceptable cost. Thus warehousing is 
often considered a core activity.
However, if we accept the view that core competencies differentiate one 
company from another and are the source of competitive advantage, then is 
warehousing in its basic form a core competence? Maybe not. Logistics opera-
tions can be easily imitated and the majority of companies and third parties 
provide similar levels of service.
According to Prahalad and Hamel (1990), ‘core competencies are the source 
of competitive advantage’. They suggest three useful tests to identify a core 
competence:
●
●It provides access to a wide variety of markets.
●
●It contributes significantly to the end-product benefits.
●
●It is difficult for competitors to imitate.
Gutierrez (2003) states that ‘a core competency is fundamental knowledge, 
ability, or expertise in a specific subject area or skill set’. This suggests more of 
a concentration on people skill; therefore whether a company sees logistics as 
a core competence may depend on the calibre of staff employed.
Companies may not have the management expertise and skills to operate a 
warehouse effectively and therefore outsourcing is a strong option. There can 

Outsourcing
321
also be situations where the warehouse operation requires more management 
time than other areas, which can detract from the main activity of production, 
for example.
It is up to the company to decide whether it should bring in expertise to 
strengthen its management team, train existing staff or outsource.
Improvement in customer service
According to the Capgemini (2013) survey, 56 per cent of respondents said 
their use of third-party logistics had led to year-on-year incremental benefits.
Other surveys by Eye for Transport (in 2010) suggest that more than 80 per 
cent of companies outsourcing their logistics operations are pleased with the 
service they are receiving.
However, many companies churn frequently between third-party providers. 
Most often this is a result of dissatisfaction or a quest for further cost reduc-
tions. Of the companies surveyed by Eye for Transport, 47 per cent had changed 
service provider over the past 12 months.
Cost reduction
According to the Capgemini report those respondents who achieved incremen-
tal benefits saw a reduction of up to 15 per cent in logistics costs, 8 per cent 
saving in inventory costs and 26 per cent saving in logistics assets. Previous 
surveys such as the Aberdeen report of 2008 suggested that only 20 per cent of 
best-in-class companies achieved a cost reduction through outsourcing, with 
an average reduction of 0.3 per cent, whilst others saw a neutral to negative 
position on costs.
Greater cost savings can be achieved when moving from a dedicated facility 
to a shared-use operation where costs are incurred based on volume and fluctuate 
in line with sales.
Labour relations
In the early 1980s many companies outsourced warehousing operations to 
deal with labour relations issues and spiralling wage costs.
Those companies that did outsource for these reasons didn’t always see an 
improvement as legislation meant that workforces had to be transferred under 

Warehouse Management
322
pretty much the same terms and conditions. Cost reduction and productivity 
improvements had to come from better practices, increased morale and improved 
working conditions.
Financial strategy
When companies decide to concentrate on improving their return on assets 
employed, one way of achieving this is to divest their warehouses and capital 
equipment. This can be achieved by moving to an existing third-party ware-
house, contracting with a third party to build a warehouse for your operation, 
or getting the third party to buy your existing warehouse. In this situation,  
if the warehouse is not currently fully occupied, the third party can ‘sell’ the 
surplus space to other potential clients.
In the United Kingdom, retailers outsourced their warehouse operations but 
held on to the real estate and the capital equipment, which has enabled some 
of them to in-source without significant upheaval.
Companies also entered into back-to-back contracts on key assets employed 
in the service provision. Assets were either contracted from third-party suppliers 
in line with the period of the contract or an agreement was made to transfer the 
assets to the customer at the end of the contract. This not only secured specialist 
equipment for the customer but also ensured that the third party was not left 
with equipment it couldn’t utilize at the end of the contract.
Under these circumstances third parties were able to base their contractual 
costs on the expected life of the asset, not the length of the contract period.
Flexibility
An Easter egg manufacturer I consulted for recently saw its finished goods 
stock move from 500 pallets to 10,000 pallets at peak. The difficulty in these 
circumstances is to decide on the capacity of the warehouse. The manufacturer 
decided to outsource the majority of the storage requirement, freeing up space 
for further manufacturing and putting the onus on the third party to find other 
clients to dovetail with the storage availability.
Changing markets can also have an effect on whether to remain in house or 
outsource. I’m sure that most electrical goods, computer and mobile phone 
manufacturers wished they had crystal balls 10 to 20 years ago to enable them 
to predict the significant reduction in the size of their products over time and 
as a result the size of the warehouse operation.

Outsourcing
323
Role of third-party contractors
Third-party contractors can operate dedicated and shared-user warehousing 
on behalf of their clients.
Dedicated warehouses are where a company has decided to either relinquish 
its own warehouse operation to a third party, with the contractor taking over 
the building, staff and equipment or it may be a totally new operation where 
the client has decided to outsource rather than operate the warehouse itself. 
This could be a new build or the use of an existing building.
In shared-user warehousing, a third-party logistics company will acquire a 
warehouse and use it to provide services on behalf of a number of different 
clients who manufacture wide-ranging products.
The warehouses can also operate as fulfilment centres where a number of 
different e-commerce or mail order clients are housed in the same building and 
are provided with similar services.
Other shared-user warehouses may operate on behalf of companies that 
produce the same type of products. Although in competition, the manufacturers 
see the synergy advantages of their products being stored in the same ware-
house and delivered through the same distribution channels.
Staff are experienced in handling the product and the cost of deliveries to 
retail outlets can be shared among the manufacturers.
A variation of this is the retail consolidation warehouse where a retailer’s 
suppliers store and cross dock product destined for the retailer’s DC or even 
direct to store. These centres can either be operated in house or by third-party 
companies.
Preparing to outsource
Having decided to outsource, there are a number of things to do before con-
tacting any third- or fourth-party logistics providers:
●
●Ensure current processes are as efficient as possible: you should never 
outsource a problem – it only gets worse.
●
●Understand your current cost structure.
●
●Benchmark the operation against your peers both internally and externally.
●
●Determine your future strategy.
●
●Understand the third-party market – which third parties are operating 
in your market sector?
●
●Collect the relevant data.

Although very tempting, outsourcing a problem is not a good idea. It’s much 
better and wiser to ensure that all processes are working efficiently prior to issuing 
an invitation to tender. If you do not have the resource internally then utilizing 
consultants is an option.
It’s highly important to understand the total cost of current operations before 
requesting responses from potential partners. How will you compare costs and 
evaluate the viability of outsourcing if you do not know your own costs? 
Involve a number of departments in this exercise so that you understand the 
full cost of your logistics operation.
Furthermore, you need to know what additional costs you will incur after 
outsourcing. For example: do you intend to employ a contract manager; what 
will be the effect on the finance department regarding the checking of invoices; 
what will be the cost of systems integration with the third party? Take all of 
these costs into account.
By benchmarking your existing operation either internally or with some of 
your competitors you will get a better understanding of where you should be 
in terms of cost and performance. You can use these figures to assess the third-
party bids.
One point of caution with regard to benchmarking in this situation is that 
you should not use the tender process to benchmark your operation unless you 
explain fully to the third parties what you are doing.
It costs third parties a great deal of money to put a comprehensive bid  
together and if they eventually realize you have no intention of outsourcing 
they will be very reluctant to put in the same amount of work the next time you 
approach them with a genuine request.
By keeping current with trade press reports, you will know about most of 
the third parties in the market; however, it is also prudent to take advice from 
other colleagues, companies or logistics consultants on which third parties are 
likely to provide the right service for you. It is better to target a small number 
of third parties rather than use a scattergun approach.
Our advice is to approach as few companies as possible to enable you to 
spend as much time as possible evaluating the responses. Time is valuable and 
inviting scores of companies wastes not only your time but also theirs.
Issuing an RFI (request for information) can assist you in shortlisting suitable 
candidates by asking a few pertinent questions. These could include:
●
●experience in and understanding of your particular market sector;
●
●availability of resources;
●
●suitable range of services;
●
●ability to comply with timescales;
●
●financial stability;

●
●geographic coverage;
●
●contract renewal success rates; and
●
●culture.
In order to receive accurate quotations from the third parties you should provide 
them with comprehensive data. This will also enable you to compare the total 
cost of operation and weigh up the benefits of outsourcing.
If you have decided to go out to tender and have chosen a number of third 
parties to respond, follow this simple advice; otherwise you are unlikely to get 
the most competitive and comprehensive quotation:
●
●Provide as much data as possible.
●
●Don’t be too prescriptive – allow scope for ‘blue sky’ thinking.
●
●Allow the third parties to visit the existing operation.
●
●Share the questions and answers amongst all participants.
●
●Allow sufficient time for the third parties to respond.
●
●Ensure that key staff are available during the tender process.
●
●Ask for an estimate of start-up costs.
●
●Ensure that all responses include the third-party assumptions.
●
●Request a timetable for implementation.
Choosing the right partner
Bititci et al (2008) suggest that the following have to be taken into account 
when choosing the right partner:
●
●Strategic synergy: the potential fit of the business model and strategic 
priorities of the partner organization are aligned with your own.
●
●Operational synergy: the potential fit of the relevant business processes 
of the partner organization are aligned with your own.
●
●Commercial synergy: the nature of the commercial, risk management 
and service level agreements between both companies are aligned.
●
●Cultural synergy: the cultural fit between the two organizations at 
strategic and operational level is strong.
A decision table will assist you greatly in deciding on the most suitable third 
party. Having decided on your criteria, weigh their importance and score each 
company against them. Criteria will vary from company to company, as will 
the weighting for each criterion. Table 14.2 shows an example.

Cottrill and Gary (2005–6) suggest that other, somewhat softer issues should also 
be taken into account when choosing a long-term partner, such as the following:
●
●Creativity and ability to innovate:
–– A supplier with a culture of creativity and innovation is normally a 
good problem solver, which can translate into cost-saving operations.
–– Customers look to the third party to be leading edge and challenge 
ways of working.

Outsourcing
327
–– Providers feel that they are not listened to and are boxed into a 
master–slave relationship.
–– Need openness about what the relationship is – partnership or 
supplier?
–– Openness and information sharing are key – you cannot innovate  
in a vacuum.
●
●Ability to communicate and collaborate. Rapid response and being able 
to adapt quickly to market changes are critical in today’s supply chain. 
Communication is at the heart of this.
●
●Trustworthiness. A difficult area to measure. However, you can  
start by looking at factors such as other customers’ experiences  
and the supplier’s openness about its past performance and financial 
footing.
●
●Flexibility and operational agility. For example, can the supplier cope 
with a threefold increase in sales and how will he react to a sudden 
drop in sales? Can he react quickly to a major problem such as a 
product recall or a need to re-box or re-label product? How good are 
they at ‘workarounds’?
●
●Cultural fit. Organizations with similar cultures tend to be more 
successful. Vitasek (2010) has produced a grid which shows three 
characteristics which are relatively easy to measure:
–– Do the companies have a culture of continuous improvement?
–– What are their people management styles?
–– How much emphasis do they place on cross-company training?
Once suppliers are ranked on all of these soft measures you can put them  
together with the hard metrics and develop a matrix of criteria that compares 
the performance of each company.
Having decided on a shortlist of companies based on the above criteria,  
the next step is to visit their operations – your choice, not theirs – meet with 
their operations management and talk to their staff and where possible their 
customers.
You will of course need to respect the sensitivity of certain sites if they are 
operated on behalf of a competitor, and expect not to be allowed access.
Sales staff are great at selling a concept; however, it will be the operations 
staff who will implement and run the contract, therefore it is imperative  
to meet with them and also have a say in the appointment of the contract 
manager.

Warehouse Management
328
The transition
One important area that might be neglected once a contract has been signed is 
the transfer of staff and the potential change in culture.
Change management is an important part of the process and must be handled 
effectively. The third party will have expertise in this area, having taken over a 
number of contracts in its time. Both companies need to work together to ensure 
a smooth transition. The recent transfer of the ASOS fulfilment contract in the 
United Kingdom from Unipart to Norbert Dentressangle is a typical example.
Managing a third-party relationship
As mentioned earlier, an outsourced contract is very much like a personal rela-
tionship. During the early stages there is a great deal of communication and 
agreement on many things. As the relationship matures, conversation falters 
and new ideas become fewer. The threat of another potential relationship often 
will force the parties to talk in earnest again and try to come up with new ideas. 
Figure 14.3 shows the stages that many outsourced relationships experience, 
from both a user and provider perspective.
During a CILT UK seminar on insourcing versus outsourcing in 2009, Ian 
Stansfield of Asda Walmart said in response to a question about relationships:
Relationships matter... but you can’t take me to the races! We need to learn... we 
need inspiration and innovation... show me. Don’t sell me what you want, show 
me what I need. Earn your keep.
Here the third party is seen as the expert and is expected to innovate, fully 
understand the client’s needs and use the management fee to not only ensure 
the best service but introduce a culture of continuous improvement.
Why contracts fail
An Eye for Transport survey found the factors shown in Figure 14.4 as reasons 
why outsourced relationships fail.
In terms of improving relations, the survey suggested the following improve-
ments needed to be made:
●
●Communications were cited by 67 per cent of companies surveyed as an 
opportunity for improvement on both sides.
●
●It was felt by 63 per cent that improved requirements and procedure 
definition would help.

The CILT 2012 survey produced the following reasons for non-renewal of 
contracts:
●
●Loss of trust.
●
●Reluctance to change during contract period.
●
●Promised flexibility not delivered by third-party logistics.
●
●Poor levels of service.
●
●Higher cost than envisaged and rate hikes during the contract.
●
●Failure to deliver as contracted, charging for services they’re already 
contracted to provide.
●
●Cheaper competitors.
●
●Lack of commitment by third-party logistics.
Arms-length management of outsourcing will foster silo behaviour, therefore 
relationships need to be forged at all levels within the organizations.
Outsourcing does not mean that you can walk away from responsibility for 
the outsourced task. The success of the outsourced relationship will depend on 
how well the companies work together to ensure that the initial goals are 
achieved. Trust and openness are key in outsourced relationships.
Outsourcing in logistics is normally based on a transactional relationship 
and as a result can rapidly turn adversarial. In conventional outsourcing the 
client looks to reduce costs and improve service levels whilst the third party is 

Outsourcing
331
looking to increase the size of the contract and maximize profits. Cost to the 
company which outsources is revenue to the service provider.
The future of outsourcing
Kate Vitasek’s book Vested Outsourcing: Five Rules that Will Transform 
Outsourcing (2010) offers some fascinating insights into what will likely 
become the future business model of outsourcing. Vitasek suggests that cost 
reduction, service improvement and overall profits can be increased through 
greater collaboration, creating and sharing value, and by forging a ‘what’s in it 
for we’ (WIIFWe) relationship mindset. Her premise is that companies and 
suppliers/service providers should ‘create a business model where both the 
company that outsources and the service provider are able to maximize their 
profits. Doing this means creating a culture where the parties work together to 
make the end-to-end process efficient, regardless of which party is performing 
activities. This means creating an approach where service providers are  
rewarded for reducing their revenue’. Ultimately this means moving away from 
the old-school transaction-based approach to outsourcing in favour of a col-
laborative, outcome-based structure.
This collaborative, shared-value approach is the basic premise of what 
Vitasek and her fellow researchers at the University of Tennessee have coined 
as ‘vested outsourcing’, or ‘vested’ for short.
Many cost-plus relationships are the antithesis of this approach where any 
increase in cost results in an increase in profits for the service provider unless 
there are suitable targets and rewards and margin reduction for poor performance.
Vitasek continues that the relationships and negotiations must move away 
from the culture of ‘what’s in it for me’, I-win-you-lose culture to WIIFWe.
This follows the lines of Nobel laureate John Nash’s Game Theory and the 
premise of a game show in the UK in which, at the end of each show two 
contestants are left with a pot of money. They have to individually decide to 
take the money or split the pot with the other contestant. If both decide to 
split they share the pot; however, if one decides to take the money and the 
other to split, the former gets the money. If they both decide to take the money 
they both lose.
In these circumstances collaboration results in a win–win situation.
This suggests a move away from transactional payments to suppliers being 
paid for outcomes and innovation.
The premise is that by being innovative, saving the client money whilst im-
proving service levels, the provider will increase the client’s confidence in them 
and as a result is likely to gain more work, thus increasing revenue and margin.

From confrontation to collaboration (Vitasek 2010)
The five rules set the stage of a sound outsourcing partnership, as illustrated in 
Figure 14.7.
Each of the five rules of vested is discussed briefly below.
Rule 1: Focus on outcomes, not transactions
Traditionally, many business and outsource models are transaction-based. 
Most often the transactional approach is coupled with a cost-plus or a com-
petitively bid fixed price per transaction pricing model to ensure that the buyer 
is getting the lowest cost per transaction. Under this conventional method, the 
service provider is paid for every transaction – whether or not it is needed. The 
more inefficient the entire process, the more money the service provider can 

Outsourcing
333
make. Thus, it’s a perverse incentive that rewards inefficiency and unnecessary 
activity.
The transaction-based model can achieve lower costs; however, in an out-
sourcing arrangement it often does not help the company achieve what it really 
wants or needs. This is because the company that has outsourced gets what it 
contracted for – but what it actually needed was an efficient and low-cost total 
support solution. Vested, in contrast, operates under an outcome-based model 
in which the provider aligns its interests to what the company really wants (the 
efficient, low-cost solution).
The vested model fundamentally shifts the way a company buys services. 
Actually it is fairly straightforward. Instead of paying a provider for unit trans-
actions for the various services provided – such as pallets in the warehouse, 
miles travelled, spare parts shipped, technical support hours, and so forth – the 
company and its service provider agree together upon desired performance 
outcomes. Desired outcomes are quantifiable, but take a different form: they 
can be availability, reliability, cost, revenue generation, employee or customer 
satisfaction, or even asset investment targets. Simply put, vested buys out-
comes, not individual transactions.
Rule 2: Focus on the what, not the how
In a vested arrangement, the company specifies ‘what’ it wants; the service 
provider is responsible for determining ‘how’ it gets done. This is the basic reason 
for outsourcing: in-house operations are either too expensive or ineffective (or

both) and a company looks outside for the expert who can do the job  
better. Once the provider is found, let them do the job! The problem that often 
arises, however, is something called the outsourcing paradox. By outsourcing, 
companies basically concede that they are not in the best position to do a  
specific job or jobs. Yet when they turn the work over to someone more com-
petent, they can’t resist the urge to tell the service provider how to do the job. 
Hence the paradox!
The most effective vested partnerships include minimal discussion of the 
processes the service providers must follow to meet requirements. Instead, they 
focus on expectations and outcomes. It’s up to the service provider to figure out 
how to put the supporting pieces together to achieve the company’s goals. The 
central idea is to free each company to do what they do best.
Rule 3: Agree on clearly defined and measurable outcomes
The parties must clearly define and measure desired outcomes. These outcomes 
are expressed in terms of a limited set (ideally, no more than five) of high-level 
metrics. Teams should spend time together defining how the relationship’s  
success will be measured. Attending to this upfront helps ensure that neither 
time nor resources are wasted pursuing the wrong objectives.
Once the desired outcomes are agreed upon and documented, the service 
provider can propose a solution that will deliver the required level of perform-
ance at a pre-determined price. In the third-party logistics arena, one outcome 
might be orders shipped complete and on time at a 98 percent level of service. 
This fundamentally shifts the business model, shifting risk from the company 
that is outsourcing to the service provider. Under the purest form of vested, the 
company only pays for results (namely, orders shipped complete and on time), 
not transactions (picking, packing and shipping). The service provider is paid 
for the value delivered by its overall solution, rather than being paid for each 
activity performed.
Rule 4: Pricing model with incentives that optimize the 
business
A properly structured pricing model incorporates incentives to enable the com-
pany to achieve its desired outcomes. The pricing model is based on the type of 
contract – fixed price or cost reimbursement – that will be used to reward the 
outsource provider.
When establishing the pricing model, businesses should apply two principles:
●
●The pricing model must balance risk and reward for the organizations. 
The agreement should be structured to ensure that the service provider 

Outsourcing

assumes risk only for decisions within its control. For example,  
a transportation service provider should never be penalized for  
the rising costs of fuel, and a property management service provider 
should never be penalized for an increase in energy prices.
●
●The agreement should specify that the service provider will deliver 
solutions, not just activities. When properly constructed, a vested 
agreement will provide incentives to the service provider to solve  
the company’s problems. The better the service provider is at solving 
those problems, the more profits the service provider can make.  
Service providers are thus encouraged to develop and institute 
innovative and cost-effective methods of performing work to drive 
down total cost while maintaining or improving service.
Inherent in the vested business model is a reward for the service provider to 
make investments in process, service, or associated product that will generate 
returns in excess of contract requirements. If the service provider does a good 
job, it will reap the rewards of greater profitability.
When properly constructed, vested will incentivize the service provider to 
solve customer problems proactively.
Vested arrangements should be based on reducing the total cost of the pro­
cess being outsourced – not simply the budget for the outsourced services. The 
interwoven dependencies of business and outsourcing relationships require an 
environment that encourages service providers to push companies to change 
internal processes if they are inhibiting the success of a vested partnership. 
Outsourcing companies also must be open-minded and accountable for driving 
internal process changes that drive total cost reductions that will benefit all. 
But properly structured Vested partnerships can – and do – create paybacks for 
the parties.
Rule 5: Governance structures that provide insight, 
not merely oversight
A vested relationship is based on insight versus oversight governance that  
empowers the parties to pursue improvements that will deliver better perform-
ance, higher profits, and lower total ownership cost. There are still some  
companies today that operate without benefit of a formal contract or any real 
agreement in place. Fortunately, this is a declining minority. Yet some have 
gone to the other extreme: they often have a small army of people, frequently 
referred to as ‘programme managers’, who micromanage the outsource pro-
vider. An effective vested partnership outsources processes to service providers 
that are real experts in those processes. The partnerships should be managed to 
create a culture of insight vs oversight.

Warehouse Management
336
The five key rules of a sound outsourcing partnership set the stage for  
companies to take their outsourcing relationships to the next level – a true 
vested performance partnership.
For many companies a WIIFWe, win–win approach must be learned; they 
have to unlearn conventional approaches and ways of thinking. In a vested 
relationship the organizations must work together upon a foundation of trust 
where there is mutual accountability for achieving the destined outcomes.
Most companies that use vested as an approach for outsourcing do not 
spend much time talking about how it gives their outsource providers the  
opportunity to make more money. Rather, they focus on how it delivers better 
value or better outcomes at the same or lower total cost. Nevertheless, service 
providers who work under vested partnerships often focus on the higher profit 
potential of vested and also note that such successfully designed partnerships 
create happier clients. Because the organizations are working together to 
achieve their goals, vested works as a true win–win relationship, which is what 
a partnership is all about.
Organizations that challenge the WIIFMe mentality are able to achieve true 
vested relationships that deliver outstanding results. Adopting anything less 
than a WIIFWe philosophy will result in less than optimal business relationships.
In order to make an outsourcing partnership work, the parties should take 
the following steps:
●
●Define why you are outsourcing and what success looks like.
●
●Define the value you want to create from outsourcing and test for 
realism.
●
●Tailor the selection process and understand the benefit/cost of  
exam-based tendering if you want a partner.
●
●Align the commercial structures and performance metrics to drive the 
right behaviours.
●
●Invest in the relationship and openly share information.
●
●Outsource for the right reasons, with total buy-in from your business.
●
●Make it work for both companies.
●
●Develop a partnership.
●
●Help your partner understand your business.
●
●Get the right people in key roles.
According to Craig Mulholland (2009) from Norbert Dentressangle:
You need to understand that third parties work to provide excellent service to 
delight their customers, but are commercial organizations that need to make a 
profit. They exist because they are needed. Removing this cynical barrier leaves 
everyone free to focus on solutions.

Outsourcing
337
Summary and conclusion
Outsourcing is a choice and it takes two to make it work: it’s not necessarily 
right for all companies. Care thus needs to be taken on the decision on whether 
to outsource, and on the choice of partner.
Outsourcing is all about creating a relationship and crafting a framework 
for long-term, collaborative success. The steps can be akin to a personal  
relationship:
●
●Dating: talking prior to the contract award.
●
●Engagement: looking forward to a life together after the contract 
award.
●
●Marriage. contract award and early successes.
●
●The in-laws: parent company interventions.
●
●Familiarity: you don’t talk anymore!
●
●Divorce: loss of contract.
But if the outsource partnership is crafted and nurtured correctly, those last 
three items need never occur!

Health and 
safety
GWYNNE RICHARDS AND TIM CULPIN
Health and safety is a fundamental part of business. Boards 
need someone with passion and energy to ensure it stays at  
the core of the organization.
(Health and Safety Executive)
Introduction
During a discussion on LinkedIn, managers were asked which areas in the 
warehouse were high on their priority list. Safety was the most popular answer. 
This chapter looks to inform managers of the potential hazards found within 
the warehouse and how they can make the area as safe as possible for their 
staff. Accidents will happen; however, there are processes that can reduce the 
dangers significantly.
This can also be a high-cost area, not only in providing a safe environment 
but also the cost of not providing a safe and secure place of work.
Warehousing and storage cover a whole range of activities, all of which have 
their own hazards and risks. Employers need to ensure effective health and 
safety management, looking at the risks involved in the workplace and then 
putting in place effective control measures to properly manage health and 
safety.
In 2010/11 in the United Kingdom there was one warehouse-related fatality 
and over 330 major injuries.

Health and Safety
339
The most recent surveys from the United States show that 16 people were 
killed in warehouse-related accidents in 2011. There were 31,200 non-fatal, 
warehouse-related occupational injuries caused by the following:
●
●overexertion (poor lifting, etc) – 45 per cent;
●
●contact with equipment – 31 per cent;
●
●falls and trips – 19 per cent;
●
●transport related – 3 per cent;
●
●harmful substances – 1 per cent.
Thirty-five per cent of the incidents resulted in staff being away from work for 
more than 31 days. 42 per cent of the injuries received were strains, sprains and 
muscle tears. The highest number of accidents occurred on a Monday and most 
accidents took place between the hours of 8 am and 12 pm. The number of 
incidents per 100 employees (5.3) is higher than the national average of 3.8 
(US Bureau of Labour Statistics).
The main causes of major injuries in the warehouse, according to the HSE, 
are shown in Figure 15.1.

OSHA also cite the following:
●
●unsafe use of forklifts;
●
●improper stacking of products;
●
●failure to use proper personal protective equipment (PPE);
●
●failure to follow proper lockout/tagout procedures, ie prevent 
equipment from being accidentally energized;
●
●inadequate fire safety provisions; and
●
●repetitive motion injuries.
In terms of recording injuries received within the warehouse, OSHA require 
companies to record the total recordable incidence rate.
The formula is as follows:
(Total number of injuries and illnesses × 200,000)
Number of hours worked by all employees
 = OSHA incidence rate
This can be included in the list of performance measures.
Another measure can be the number of days since a reportable accident  
occurred.
Depending on the workplace and specific work types, there may be other 
risks on site that need to be considered as well as those set out above. 
Warehousing is a very complex industry that exposes workers to a whole variety 
of risks, and therefore employers must ensure that health and safety is treated 
with the utmost importance at management level.
A health and safety policy is a stepping stone to ensuring health and safety 
in the workplace, and in the United Kingdom if a business has more than five 
employees (this includes directors) there must be a written policy in place. This 
policy should be brought to the attention of all of its employees.
Although it is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom for companies 
who employ less than five staff, a written policy can improve health and safety 
within the business.
Each country will have its own Health and Safety legislation and therefore 
we will concentrate on the aspects we believe to be important and relevant. 
Details of the respective Health and Safety authorities by country are outlined 
in the list of websites.
The Health and Safety at Work Act in the United Kingdom places responsi-
bility for health and safety into three categories:
●
●employer responsibilities:
–– provision of a health and safety statement policy;
–– provision of safety equipment;
–– commitment to train staff.

Health and Safety
341
●
●employee responsibilities:
–– obligation to cooperate with their employer;
–– obligation to undertake training, report issues and not to misuse 
equipment.
●
●manufacturers’ responsibilities:
–– ensure product is safe to use and fit for purpose.
Risk assessments
In today’s atmosphere of increased litigation there is added pressure on manag-
ers to ensure the safety of their employees. Managers have to take appropriate 
steps to identify potential areas where accidents can occur and take steps to 
avoid them.
Note that a hazard is anything that may cause harm, such as chemicals, 
working from height, broken pallets, etc. The risk is the chance, high or low, 
that somebody could be harmed by these and other hazards, together with an 
indication of how serious the harm could be.
A risk assessment is an important step in protecting your workforce and 
your business as well as complying with the law. It helps you to focus on the 
risks that really matter in your workplace, ie the ones with the potential  
to cause harm. For most, that means simple, cheap and effective measures to 
ensure that the workforce is fully protected.
The law does not expect you to eliminate all risk but you are required  
to protect staff and visitors as far as is reasonably practicable. According to 
the HSE, this means that you ‘have to take action on the health and safety 
risks in the warehouse except where the cost (in terms of time and effort as 
well as money) of doing so is “grossly disproportionate” to the reduction in 
the risk’.
A risk assessment is simply a careful examination of what can cause harm 
to people so that you can weigh up whether you have taken enough precau-
tions or should do more to prevent harm. Staff and others have a right to be 
protected from harm caused by a failure to take reasonable control measures. 
You are legally required to assess the risks in your workplace, so you must put 
plans in place to control risks. However, don’t overcomplicate the process. 
Most risks are easily identifiable and the necessary control measures are easy 
to implement.
You also need to decide whether you have the necessary experience in house 
to undertake the risk assessment or whether you need to employ an external 
health and safety expert.

Warehouse Management
342
A risk assessment can be broken down into five stages:
Step 1: Identify the hazards.
Step 2: Decide who might be harmed and how.
Step 3: Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions.
Step 4: Record and communicate your findings and implement them.
Step 5: Review your risk assessment regularly and update if necessary.
Identify the hazards
Walk around the warehouse, internally and externally, and look at what could 
reasonably be expected to cause harm.
Ask your colleagues and staff if they are aware of any potential hazards.
Check the manufacturers’ instructions or data sheets for chemicals and 
equipment as they can be very helpful in spelling out the hazards and putting 
them in their true perspective. Check back on your accident records (ensure 
that near misses are also recorded). See Figure 15.2.
Assess potential long-term affects to health, eg high levels of noise or ex­
posure to harmful substances.
The accident pyramid shows that for every 600 near misses there are 10 
serious injuries and for every 10 serious injuries there can be one fatality. Thus 
every near miss needs to be recorded, investigated, actioned, staff trained and 
the situation reviewed regularly.

Germain 1996)

Health and Safety
343
Decide who might be harmed and how
For each hazard you need to be clear about who might be at risk and poten-
tially harmed; it will help you to identify the best way of managing the risk. 
That doesn’t mean listing everyone by name, but rather identifying groups of 
people (eg in-handling team, visitors).
Remember:
●
●Some workers have particular requirements, eg new staff and people 
with disabilities may be at particular risk.
●
●Include cleaners, visitors, contractors, maintenance workers, etc who 
may not be in the workplace all the time.
●
●In each case, identify how they might be harmed, ie what type of injury 
or ill health might occur. For example, ‘Staff stacking shelves may suffer 
back injury from repeated lifting of boxes.’
●
●Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions.
●
●Discuss your findings with the company’s safety representative.
Having identified the hazards, you then have to decide what to do about them. 
The law requires you to do everything ‘reasonably practicable’ to protect  
people from harm. You can work this out for yourself, but the easiest way is to 
compare what you are doing with good practice.
First, look at what you’re already doing. Think about what controls you 
have in place and how the work is organized. Compare this with good practice 
and see if there’s more you should be doing to bring yourself up to standard.  
In asking yourself this, consider:
●
●Can I get rid of the hazard altogether?
●
●If not, how can I control the risks so that harm is unlikely?
●
●When controlling risks, apply the following principles, if possible in this 
order:
–– Try a less risky option (eg switch to using a less hazardous chemical).
–– Prevent access to the hazard (eg by using guardrails).
–– Organize work to reduce exposure to the hazard (eg put barriers 
between pedestrians and traffic).
●
●Issue personal protective equipment (eg clothing, footwear, goggles).
●
●Provide welfare facilities (eg first aid and washing facilities for removal 
of contamination).
Improving health and safety need not cost a great deal. For instance, placing a 
mirror on a dangerous blind corner to help prevent vehicle accidents is a low-cost 

Warehouse Management

precaution, considering the risks. Failure to take simple precautions can cost 
you a lot more if an accident does happen.
Involve staff, so that you can be sure that what you propose to do will work 
in practice and won’t introduce any new hazards.
Implement your findings and record and communicate 
them
Putting the results of your risk assessment into practice will make a difference 
when looking after people and your business.
Recording the results of your risk assessment and sharing them with your 
staff encourage you to do this. When recording your results, keep it simple: for 
example ‘Tripping over rubbish: bins provided, staff instructed, daily house-
keeping checks’, or ‘Broken pallets in racking: products repalletized, daily 
housekeeping check’.
The HSE does not expect a risk assessment to be perfect, but it must be suitable 
and sufficient. You need to be able to show that:
●
●a proper check was made;
●
●you asked who might be affected;
●
●you dealt with all the obvious significant hazards, taking into account 
the number of people who could be involved;
●
●the precautions are reasonable, and the remaining risk is low; and
●
●you involved your staff or their representatives in the process.
If, like many businesses, you find that there are quite a lot of improvements 
that you could make, big and small, don’t try to do everything at once. Make a 
plan of action to deal with the most important things first. Health and safety 
inspectors acknowledge the efforts of businesses that are clearly trying to make 
improvements.
A good plan of action often includes a mixture of different things such as:
●
●a few cheap or easy improvements that can be done quickly, perhaps as 
a temporary solution until more reliable controls are in place;
●
●long-term solutions to those risks most likely to cause accidents or ill 
health;
●
●long-term solutions to those risks with the worst potential consequences;
●
●arrangements for training employees on the main risks that remain and 
how they are to be controlled;
●
●regular checks to make sure that the control measures stay in place; and
●
●clear responsibilities – who will lead on what action and by when.

Health and Safety
345
Clear signage
Remember, prioritize and tackle the most important things first. As you com-
plete each action, tick it off your plan.
Review your assessment regularly and update if necessary
Few workplaces stay the same. Sooner or later, you will bring in new equip-
ment, substances and procedures that could lead to new hazards. It makes 
sense, therefore, to review what you are doing on an ongoing basis. Every three 
months or after a significant incident, formally review where you are, to make 
sure you are still improving or at least not sliding back.
Look at your risk assessment again. Have there been any changes? Are there 
improvements you still need to make? Have your workers spotted a problem? 
Have you learnt anything from accidents or near misses? Make sure your risk 
assessment stays up to date.
When you are running a business it’s all too easy to forget about reviewing 
your risk assessment – until something has gone wrong and it’s too late. Set a 
review date for the risk assessment. Write it down and note it in your diary as 
a regular event.
During the year, if there is a significant change, don’t wait: check your risk 
assessment and, where necessary, amend it. If possible, it is best to think about 
the risk assessment when you’re planning your change – that way you leave 
yourself more flexibility.

Layout and design
As part of a health and safety regime, steps must be taken to protect the welfare 
of employees and visitors, and therefore a safe and healthy environment must 
be ensured with proper welfare facilities being made available.
In terms of ensuring a safe environment, a warehouse should be designed 
and laid out to allow people to move around it safely. A well-thought-out design 
and layout of a warehouse will help to reduce accidents, particularly those  
involving vehicles and slips/trips. Points to consider when thinking about  
design and layout include:
●
●storage areas, aisles and gangways;
●
●pedestrian traffic routes;
●
●stairs and ramps; and
●
●emergency escape routes.

Included in this should be the regular inspection and maintenance of equip-
ment within the warehouse.
Racking tends to be the largest structure within the warehouse and at times 
the most neglected in terms of inspection. The following racking checklist can 
be drawn up as an inspection sheet, and should be introduced and checked 
regularly:
●
●Is the equipment on sound, level flooring?
●
●Is it still installed correctly?
●
●Are double-sided runs connected properly?
●
●Are the aisles wide enough?
●
●Are the beam connector locks securely fastened?
●
●Are the racks aligned properly?
●
●Are the correct pallets being used?
●
●Are the pallets in good condition?
●
●Is there any visible damage?
●
●When was it last inspected?
●
●Are there signs on the end detailing weight capacities?
●
●Are staff trained properly?
●
●Are there any receptacles for rubbish, eg shrink wrap, packaging, 
broken bits of pallet?
A significant hazard within any warehouse is where improperly stored goods 
can fall and injure staff. Carrying out these checks regularly should minimize 
these occurrences.
Figure 15.3 shows the importance of ensuring that beam connector locks 
are installed for each and every beam to avoid catastrophic damage. The picture 
overleaf shows how damage has been minimized by correct procedures.
Fire safety
Employers need to have an emergency plan that describes what is expected of 
employees in the event of an emergency, including:
●
●provisions for emergency exit locations and evacuation procedures;
●
●procedures for accounting for all employees and visitors; and
●
●location and use of fire extinguishers and other emergency  
equipment.

Warehouse Management

A fire risk assessment must be undertaken to ensure that fire safety procedures, 
fire prevention measures and fire precautions are all in place and correct. The 
five stages of fire risk assessment are:
Step 1: Identify fire hazards.
Step 2: Identify people at risk.
Step 3: Evaluate, remove, reduce and protect from risk.
Step 4: Record, plan, inform, instruct and train.
Step 5: Review and revise risk assessments as necessary.
Having an escape route at the back of the racking is an area often neglected by 
companies.

Slips and trips
Within the storage and warehousing industry, slips and trips are a very serious 
problem. They are responsible for one-third of major injuries and a fifth of 
over-three-days absence injuries in the United Kingdom. According to the  
US Department of Labor, slips, trips and falls make up the majority of general 
industry accidents, which account for 15 per cent of all accidental deaths,  
25 per cent of all injury claims, and 95 million lost work days annually. That’s 
65 per cent of the total of lost workdays. Therefore a working environment 
must be created where they are much less likely to happen.
According to Scott Stone from Cisco Eagle companies need to:
●
●Enforce good housekeeping. Don’t allow spills to stay on the floor. Soak 
up oil or greasy waste, and instantly mop up liquid spills. Be sure you have 
absorbent powders and other cleaning agents on hand. Also, consider 
purchasing spill containment systems and liquid storage cabinets.
●
●Don’t let your aisles become cluttered. Clutter can hide spills and cause 
fall hazards.
●
●Remove or strictly control the use of cell phones. People walking in a 
warehouse or on a plant floor while texting or otherwise paying 
attention to their phone screen are asking for an accident (a slip, or 
worse, collision with an industrial vehicle).
●
●Provide anti-slip mats wherever possible, but in particular in areas 
known for wet or oily conditions. Install carpet mats at entrances to 
reduce wet shoes entering an area where polished concrete can make 
them into ice skates.
●
●Make sure workers wear appropriate footwear on your plant floor. 
Slippery, inadequate shoes are a major contributor to slip and fall 
accidents.
●
●Be sure handrails are installed wherever possible. Use gates and other 
obstructions to slow the pace of walking in critical areas.
●
●Be certain that lighting is adequate.
●
●Train for success. Make sure people understand that running isn’t 
allowed on your floor, nor are other dangerous behaviours.
●
●Keep floors and traffic routes free from obstructions that may present a 
hazard, particularly near stairs, on emergency routes or in/near doorways.
The workplace must be regularly inspected to ensure that flooring remains 
adequate and repairs are undertaken wherever necessary. Any spillages must be 
cleaned up immediately.

Warehouse Management
352
Manual handling
In warehousing, manual handling can often cause work-related problems,  
including back pain and neck pain. If there is a risk from a manual handling 
task, a risk assessment must be undertaken and the potential risk should be 
avoided. If this risk cannot be avoided, the risk of injury occurring must be 
minimized as far as possible. When considering a manual handling operation, 
the following must be taken into account:
●
●the task;
●
●the load;
●
●the working environment; and
●
●individual capacity.
Wherever possible, you should try to use mechanical handling devices such as 
lift trucks, pallet trucks, trolleys or scissors lifts. Mechanical handling devices 
should help to avoid or reduce manual handling operations.
All employees should be trained in safe manual handling techniques, train-
ing should be specific to the tasks that they undertake and all such training 
should be recorded. Operators should also be encouraged to get a co-worker 
to assist if a product is too heavy.
Shelves and bins should also be repositioned to reduce lifts from shoulder 
and floor height. Popular items should be kept on the middle shelves to avoid 
continuous bending and stretching.
Finally, ensure that overhead lighting is adequate for the task in hand.
Working at height
Working at height can be a particular risk in the warehousing and storage  
industry, and any working at height must be properly planned, supervised and 
carried out in as safe a manner as possible. Generally, it is advisable that all 
work at height should be avoided; however, if this is impossible, equipment 
must be provided to allow such work to be carried out in as safe a way as  
possible. Any equipment that is provided to allow working at height must  
be inspected regularly to ensure that it remains safe and is being used in the 
correct manner.

Vehicles
A common cause of accidents in the loading bay is from vehicle creep, where  
a lorry either drifts slightly away from the loading dock or, in the worst-case 
scenario, the driver moves off before warehouse operatives have actually  
finished loading or unloading the vehicle. This is known as a ‘drive-away’ and 
can have serious, indeed fatal, consequences.
From a safety aspect there needs to be assurance that the vehicle cannot be 
driven away whilst it is in the process of being unloaded. This can be done in a 
number of ways:
●
●The vehicle keys can be held on the loading bay and handed back to the 
driver when the unloading operation has been completed.
●
●The vehicle/trailer can be immobilized in some way either by using 
wheel locks, clamps, chocks or trailer safety interlocks which fit to the 
air hose coupling and interlock with the warehouse bay door.
●
●A system of lights can be introduced on the loading bay indicating when 
it is safe for a driver to pull away from the bay.
A combination of the above is likely to be the most effective safety system. 
Ruth Waring of Labyrinth Logistics Consulting adds a note of warning: 
‘Foreign drivers with left-hand-drive vehicles operating in the UK can easily get 
confused by traffic light systems on bay doors, as they may be looking at the 
wrong set of lights and still pull away whilst loading is ongoing.’
Another thing to watch out for is drivers who deliberately carry a spare set 
of keys so they can listen to the radio or have the heater on while they are wait-
ing. Placing a high ‘Stop’ sign right in front of the cab (this can be moved by  
a forklift truck if pallet mounted) makes it much harder for the driver to mis-
interpret any signals from the loaders and simply drive off.
Drive-away can also happen when the trailer is being loaded/unloaded from 
the side by forklift truck, where the driver thinks the loading has finished and 
drives off. If the forks are in a pallet at the time, the forklift truck can tip over 
90 degrees, which has also led to fatalities.
Vehicle creep isn’t the only hazard in the loading bay, according to John 
Meale (2010) from Thorworld:
Most trailers are not equipped with internal lighting, so it’s a good idea to fit dock 
lights to improve visibility. Otherwise, operatives entering the vehicle from a brightly 
lit warehouse can struggle to adjust to the change in conditions and may not see 
potential hazards, causing injury to themselves or potentially damaging goods.
Loading bays should also be fitted with safety guards to ensure that staff and 
trucks cannot fall from the dock when not in use.

Warehouse Management
354
With regard to the driver, there are a number of issues. First there is the deci-
sion whether the driver should assist in the offloading of the vehicle or at least 
supervise the offloading to ensure damage isn’t caused to the product during 
this process. The driver will have to comply with the Health and Safety policy 
of the warehouse.
With the increase in imported goods and cross-border movements, the pro-
duction of driver guidelines in different languages will assist in the communica-
tion process between drivers and the receiving team. Issuing picture guidance 
is also a good idea.
Moving vehicles need to be carefully managed to control and reduce the 
likelihood of accidents. The following points must be considered in relation to 
vehicles in and around the warehouse:
●
●managing deliveries and visitors;
●
●pedestrian safety: pedestrians and vehicles have to be able to circulate 
safely;
●
●traffic route: designed to minimize the need for reversing, avoiding 
sharp bends and blind corners;
●
●reversing vehicles: designed to reduce the risks from reversing vehicles 
wherever possible, for example a one-way system;
●
●coupling and uncoupling: ensure this is done safely;
●
●road safety: ensure that there is a safe work system in place to ensure 
the loading and unloading of vehicles safely;
●
●forklift trucks.
Forklift trucks
According to the HSE, who analysed workplace vehicle accidents over a 10-
year period, there are around 2,000 forklift accidents each year in the UK, a 
figure that seems to remain fairly consistent.
In accidents involving forklift trucks, 87 per cent were attributed to counter-
balance trucks. The highest number of accidents (48 per cent) occur when 
stacking/retrieving goods, and the greatest cause of accidents is being struck by 
a moving vehicle.
As many accidents occur when operating or when in the vicinity of forklift 
trucks, we have listed the following guidelines from the US National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
NIOSH recommends that employers and workers comply with OSHA regu-
lations and consensus standards, maintain equipment and take the following 
measures to prevent injury when operating or working near forklifts.

Health and Safety
355
The key areas are as follows:
●
●Make sure that workers do not operate a forklift unless they have  
been trained and licensed.
●
●Develop, implement and enforce a comprehensive written safety 
programme that includes worker training, operator licensing and a 
timetable for reviewing and revising the programme.
●
●Establish a vehicle inspection and maintenance programme.
●
●Retro fit forklifts with an operator restraint system if possible.
●
●Ensure that operators use only an approved lifting cage and  
adhere to general safety practices for elevating personnel  
with a forklift. Also, secure the platform to the lifting  
carriage or forks.
●
●Do not move the forklift whilst the cage is in the air.
●
●Provide means for personnel on the platform to shut off  
power to the truck whenever the truck is equipped with  
vertical only or vertical and horizontal controls for  
lifting personnel.
●
●Separate forklift traffic and other workers where possible.
●
●Limit some aisles to workers on foot only or forklifts only.
●
●Restrict the use of forklifts near time clocks, break rooms, cafeterias  
and main exits, particularly when the flow of workers on foot is at a 
peak (such as at the end of a shift or during breaks).
●
●Install physical barriers where practical to ensure that workstations  
are isolated from aisles travelled by forklifts.
●
●Evaluate intersections and other blind corners to determine whether 
overhead dome mirrors could improve the visibility of forklift operators 
or workers on foot.
●
●Make every effort to alert workers when a forklift is nearby. Use horns, 
audible reversing alarms and flashing lights to warn workers and other 
forklift operators in the area. Flashing lights are especially important in 
areas where the ambient noise level is high.
●
●Ensure that workplace safety inspections are routinely conducted by a 
person who can identify hazards and conditions that are dangerous to 
workers. Hazards include obstructions in the aisle, blind corners and 
intersections and forklifts that come too close to workers on foot. The 
person who conducts the inspections should have the authority to 
implement prompt corrective measures.

Warehouse Management
356
●
●Do not store bins, racks or other materials at corners, intersections or 
other locations that obstruct the view of operators or workers at 
workstations.
●
●Enforce safe driving practices such as obeying speed limits, stopping at 
stop signs and slowing down and blowing the horn at intersections.
●
●Repair and maintain cracks, crumbling edges and other defects on 
loading docks, aisles and other operating surfaces.
Warehouse equipment legislation
There are two major parts of legislation within the UK which relate directly to 
the operation of warehouse equipment: Provision and Use of Work Equipment 
Regulations, 1998 (PUWER 1998), and The Lifting Operations and Lifting 
Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER).
All mechanical handling and lifting equipment is classed as ‘work equip-
ment’ and subject to PUWER. These regulations require:
●
●the inspection and maintenance of equipment;
●
●the provision of information, instruction and training;
●
●the marking of controls;
●
●that mobile work equipment for carrying persons is suitable;
●
●protection from rolling over;
●
●facilities to prevent unauthorized operation;
●
●the provision of lighting equipment where necessary;
●
●the provision, where necessary, of devices to improve vision.
Finally, with regard to lifting equipment used within the warehouse, LOLER 
states that lifting equipment needs to be inspected and thoroughly examined:
●
●after installation and before first use;
●
●if lifting people or is a lifting attachment – every six months;
●
●at least every 12 months for all other equipment; and
●
●each time the equipment has been involved in an accident.
Note that inspection has to be made by someone who is competent, sufficiently 
independent and impartial to make objective decisions. Serious defects should 
be reported to the HSE and the item taken out of service.

Health and Safety
357
First aid
You should consider and plan for any accidents or emergency that could occur 
in which an employee or a member of the public is exposed to danger. It is 
recommended that procedures are in place to deal with emergencies such as 
serious injuries, spills or fire.
There must be some provision for first aid and the Health and Safety (First 
Aid) Regulations 1981 set out first aid requirements for the workplace. 
Assessments of first aid needs should be carried out to ensure that there are 
adequate and appropriate equipment and facilities in giving first aid to employ-
ees (including a first aid box and first aid room, depending on the size of the 
warehouse).
Businesses should have an ‘appointed person’ where necessary to take charge 
in the event of an emergency. This person does not need to be a qualified first 
aider, but should take charge of the first aid arrangements, whether this means 
just looking after a first aid box and calling the emergency services, or some-
thing more. However, qualified first aiders should be considered. Whether these 
are needed and the number required depends on the nature of the warehouse, 
number of employees and the location of the site.
First aid training must be available to any first aiders and they must be  
retrained before the expiration of each three-year certificate in first aid at work. 
In terms of how many qualified first aiders are required, an example would be 
that a medium-risk warehouse with fewer than 20 employees only requires at 
least one appointed person. However, as a general rule there must be at least 
one qualified first aider for every 50 people employed. Ensuring cover at different 
times of the day is a sensible procedure.
Summary and conclusion
Health and safety at work has become a major concern of warehouse manag-
ers. The casualty rates remain high and the increase in litigation as a result of 
injuries sustained in the warehouse has put added pressure on warehouse 
managers.
Managers need to be vigilant and undertake regular risk assessments. They 
need to ensure that their staff are working to the correct procedures and that 
equipment is maintained to the highest standards.

Warehouse Management
358
According to the HSE, addressing health and safety should not be seen as a 
regulatory burden. It offers significant opportunities. Benefits can include:
●
●reduced costs and reduced risks: employee absence and turnover rates 
are lower, accidents are fewer, the threat of legal action is lessened;
●
●improved standing among suppliers and partners;
●
●a better reputation for corporate responsibility among investors, 
customers and communities; and
●
●increased productivity: employees are healthier, happier and better 
motivated.
There are many excellent publications by the HSE in the UK and OSHA in the 
United States which provide guidance on health and safety within the ware-
house. Details are given at the end of this book.
Please note: Individual managers can be prosecuted under health and safety 
legislation.

GWYNNE RICHARDS AND CLAIRE RIDING
Triple bottom line: people, planet and profit.
( John Elkington)
Introduction
In recent years, environmental and waste issues have affected us all, both at 
home and at work.
Recycling has become an everyday occurrence and carbon footprints are being 
left, but not without trace. These issues have also become ingrained into corpo-
rate social responsibility, but what does this mean for the warehousing sector?
Legislation is changing and this change is likely to result in carbon becoming 
a ‘new currency’ within a new ‘carbon economy’. This new economy will make 
all organizations aware of their ‘carbon footprints’ to gain a better understand-
ing of where their emissions come from and how they can reduce them. For all 
organizations reduced carbon emissions will result in reduced energy costs and 
increased competition (Carbon Trust 2011).
A report by the World Economic Forum (2009) suggests that humans are 
responsible for greenhouse gas emissions of 50,000 mega-tonnes of CO2e. 
CO2e is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The logistics 
industry contributes around 2,800 mega-tonnes of CO2e. That is 6 per cent of 
total emissions with warehousing contributing 10.7 per cent of the logistics 
emissions. Logistics industry emissions are not only caused by fuel consumption 
but also packaging and the energy used in warehouses.

In 2010, according to the Carbon Trust Partnership (CTP), it was estimated 
that the warehousing industry in the UK represented approximately 3 per cent 
of the UK’s CO2 emissions.
Keith Horgan of the CTP commented that ‘there are substantial opportunities 
within the warehousing industry to save energy, costs and reduce carbon by the 
simple implementation of existing, low-energy technology’. He said, ‘We are 
not talking about high-tech solutions but pragmatic and cost-effective actions. 
For example, lighting and heating are the core areas for energy- and carbon-
saving focus. The UK warehousing industry could save in excess of £150 million 
in energy costs and 1.5 million tonnes of carbon by making simple changes’ 
(United Kingdom Warehousing Association, 2010).
According to a market report by Eye for Transport (North American 3PL 
Market Report, 2010), 96 per cent of third parties, 100 per cent of manufacturers/
retailers and 91 per cent of solution providers see sustainability initiatives as  
a priority. Companies feel that customer pressure and confidence, company 
image and differentiation together with regulatory compliance are the main 
driving forces for the introduction of sustainability measures. This was borne 
out by a recent survey by American Shipper which stated the above as drivers 
for sustainability together with a return on investment. In terms of barriers  
to environmental initiatives, these include a lack of ROI, not prioritized by  
management, lack of or inconsistent standards and economic instability.  
The Material Handling Industry of America (MHIA) also released the results 
of a research study on ‘Sustainability in Warehousing, Distribution and 
Manufacturing’ in 2011. According to the report, 48 per cent of respondents 
currently have a sustainability initiative underway and 88 per cent say that 
sustainability will be of even greater importance over the next 18–24 months.
An overwhelming majority of respondents, 78 per cent, cite social respon-
sibility as the driver behind sustainability initiatives while 63 per cent cite  
resulting efficiencies. Fifty-nine per cent indicated that sustainability initia-
tives were a management directive while 42 per cent said their customers were 
demanding it.
Other findings included:
●
●92 per cent of companies believe that sustainable initiatives have the 
potential to save money and resources.
●
●Other benefits of sustainability are bringing greater awareness to the 
market, tax incentives, utility rebates, and a competitive edge.
●
●Green companies are investing in lighting fixtures/controls, recycling 
products and/or fans to circulate cool or warm air.

ability as being at the forefront of occupier’s requirements with 86 per cent of

respondents agreeing that sustainability initiatives are important to the future 
of warehousing. The findings also showed that over two thirds of the occupiers 
surveyed would pay a rental premium for a green unit if it saved on operational 
costs. In addition to this 76 per cent of respondents stated that they would look 
favourably on warehousing that was powered by some form of sustainable 
energy such as wind, solar, biomass or energy from waste.
In this chapter we look at how operations within the warehouse affect  
the environment and how the warehouse can play its part in reducing carbon 
emissions.
Legislation and other pressures
Emerging legislation will have an impact on many organizations and will  
increasingly require new approaches to the management and reduction of  
energy and carbon emissions.
Each country or group of countries will have their own legislation in relation 
to the environment.
Emerging regulations in Europe will include the requirement from 2019 that 
all new buildings must be zero carbon. Further legislation such as the CRC 
Energy Efficiency Scheme will require many organizations to trade carbon and 
appear in a published league table with their peers.
A range of European and UK targets to reduce emissions have been declared 
including the EU’s 20 20 20 and The Climate Change Act (2008) which commits 
the UK to a reduction of 34 per cent of CO2 emissions by 2020 and a reduction 
of 80 per cent by 2050.
Additionally, increasing numbers of customers are requiring their suppliers 
to demonstrate improvements in their green credentials in order to meet their 
own environmental targets. To meet this challenge the warehouse sector will 
need to adopt new approaches to managing and reducing carbon emissions 
from their buildings.
Warehouse energy usage
Figure 16.1 shows the energy usage within an average-sized warehouse of circa 
15,000 square metres.
As can be seen, the main areas of energy use in UK warehouses are heating 
and lighting, with research showing that the sector could potentially achieve a 
16 per cent reduction in emissions in these areas. In warmer climates cooling 
systems will be a significant factor.

Table 16.1 outlines the key areas and low-capital-cost actions to reduce energy 
consumption and carbon dioxide emissions within warehouses. These oppor-
tunities were observed during a series of energy audits of UKWA members’ 
sites under an initiative between the Carbon Trust and UKWA.
The following list provides warehouse managers with ideas on how to  
reduce their impact on the environment and thus help companies achieve  
their CSR targets.
1	 Lighting in a non-automated warehouse can be up to 70 per cent of the 
total energy costs. Ways to reduce lighting costs are as follows:
–– introduce energy efficient lighting;
–– switch off all non-essential lighting out of business hours;
–– install movement sensors and timers
–– introduce and regularly clean skylights and clerestory windows to 
increase the use of natural light;
–– switch off lights when daylight is sufficient;
–– turn off external lights when daylight is sufficient; and
–– switch off office lights on exit or introduce motion sensors.
2	 Introduce solar panels where feasible.
3	 Use of alternative energy production methods:
–– wind turbine;
–– biomass boilers.

4	 Heating can make up 15 per cent of a warehouse’s energy costs. 
–– Use zoned and time-controlled thermostats which are set accurately 
(a 1 per cent reduction in temperature on the thermostat can reduce 
heating bills by 8 per cent).
–– Experiment with switch on times for heating and air conditioning 
and switch off well before close of business.
–– Ensure the hot water supply is sized in relation to site occupancy.
5	 Install time controls on equipment which are not required after close  
of business such as vending machines.
6	 Use of natural ventilation systems:
–– using ventilation stacks;
–– atria and automatic window openings combined with automatic 
control systems;
–– passive cooling such as breathable walls;
–– using the effective thermal mass of buildings to reduce cooling and 
ventilation energy.
7	 Cooling the warehouse can also increase energy costs.
–– Introduce sunlight reflectors.
–– Use of mobile air handling units.
8	 Switching off equipment when not in use.
9	 Ensure all doors have sufficient seals to prevent air and water entry.
10	 Rainwater collection for reuse in vehicle washing, toilets, etc.
11	 Low water use in sanitary appliances.
12	 Check insulation levels and increase where practical.
13	 Recycle where feasible and cost effective.
14	 Move to utilizing plastic totes/bins in place of cardboard.
15	 Utilize plastic or aluminium pallets.
16	 Use of gas, electric or hybrid forklift trucks.
17	 In rack charging for narrow aisle trucks.
18	 Movement reduction within the warehouse to reduce energy 
consumption.
Use of ABC analysis to ensure popular items are placed close to the 
despatch area.
19	 Kinetic energy plates provision on the access road to produce power 
from vehicles entering and leaving the site.
20	 Introduce car sharing schemes for staff.

The Warehouse and the Environment
365
21	 Encourage staff to walk or cycle to work or take public transport.
22	 Introduce training in green initiatives such as fuel-efficient MHE 
driving.
23	 Source materials locally such as packaging, paper, MHE, etc.
24	 Continually assess the situation by walking around the warehouse at 
various times during operating hours.
25	 Plant trees and shrubs to assist with the removal of emissions.
The use of smart metres, which record the amount of electricity consumed  
and when it was consumed, will also assist companies in identifying where 
consumption is greater than expected.
Finally ensure that your warehouse is also operating effectively – no unnec-
essary movements, accurate picking and despatch and effective utilization of space.
At the time of writing, CTP were making £550 million of Energy Efficiency 
Financing (EEF) available in a partnership with Siemens to UK companies. It is 
likely that many governmental initiatives such as this will become available to 
companies to assist them to reduce their carbon emissions.
Case Study 
Chalmor’s LifeSaver scheme (see Figure 16.2)
Chalmor’s LifeSaver ‘pay as you save’ scheme has enabled leading self-adhesive 
materials manufacturer Ritrama to upgrade lighting and controls at its production 
centre in Eccles with no capital outlay. Instead, the lighting installation is being 
funded through quarterly payments, which are less than the money saved each 
quarter from reduced energy consumption.
‘The LifeSaver scheme has enabled us to greatly improve the quality and 
responsiveness of our lighting, reduce our carbon footprint and save money at the 
same time,’ explained Ritrama UK’s managing director Mark Evans. ‘Furthermore, 
there hasn’t been any capital outlay, so the whole scheme makes perfect commercial 
sense.’
The work was carried out in an existing facility, part of which has recently been 
reorganized to create a self-contained finishing centre. The existing high-pressure 
sodium lighting was no longer meeting the needs of the space, so a total of 650 
sodium fittings were replaced with 420 Chalmor Brilliance high-output long-life 
fittings. This enabled Ritrama to reduce its installed electrical load by 136kW.
In addition, the new lighting is linked to Chalmor AutoLux lighting controllers, 
providing presence detection and daylight modulation to ensure that the lighting is

366
only used when needed. The enhanced control is expected to reduce the lighting’s 
running hours by around 40 per cent, resulting in a reduced electrical load and an 
annual energy saving of 1,444,956kWh.
Further savings are achieved through reduced maintenance costs. Re-lamping 
was costing nearly £10,000 per annum, whereas the Brilliance fittings are unlikely  
to require re-lamping for seven years. The combination of reduced energy and 
maintenance costs is providing Ritrama with a total saving of over £90,000 per  
annum.
As Ritrama has adopted the LifeSaver scheme, the cost of the lighting, controls 
and installation has been spread over a period of three years, providing a net saving 
of over £12,000 a year from day one.
‘We have been very pleased with the new lighting, which gives us a brighter light 
and makes the picking of colour vinyls easier through better colour rendering – as 
well as helping us to save money,’ Mark Evans concluded.

Energy production
The self-production of energy is a potential option for warehouse operators to 
consider when looking to offset their CO2 usage.
Photovoltaic panels and small wind generators are still not cost efficient,  
but combined with subsidies and other government incentives they can have a 
reasonable ROI.
Wind turbines and the production of energy from biomass can also be a viable 
way to generate low lifecycle emissions at an acceptable cost, according to 
DHL’s sustainability study.
Regulation plays an important role here. For example, in the UK many local 
authorities require businesses to generate at least 10 per cent of their energy 
needs onsite, using renewable energy sources.
Known as the Merton Rule, this policy is estimated to lead to a carbon  
saving of 350 tonnes each year for an urban town with a population of 150,000 
(Energy Saving Trust, 2007).
Case study 
Miniclipper Logistics Green Project 2012
How to turn a multi-building transport and warehousing organization into an 
environmentally friendly operation.
Miniclipper Logistics operates 180,000 square feet of third-party warehousing  
in the UK. Awarded ISO14001 in 2012 they embarked on making positive changes to 
their green policies because they wanted to prove to their customers, employees, 
and neighbours that they care about the consequences of their transport and 
warehousing operations on the environment.
Key areas to address in their warehouse operation, in addition to a company-wide 
change in philosophy, were:
●
●warehouse lighting;
●
●use of renewable energy; and
●
●waste recycling.
1  Warehouse lighting
The lighting project required an initial investment of £70,000 and has produced a 
return on investment within 1.5 years. This includes a tax break for the use of this 
technology amounting to 20 per cent of the investment in the first year.

Warehouse Management
368
Working with a local company – Chalmor – Miniclipper achieved the following benefits:
●
●300 per cent more light in the warehouse and a reduction of 42 per cent in terms 
of light fittings.
●
●Before installation the existing individual lights were operating 70 hrs/week. 
After installation of new lighting and sensors they only operate for just over 13 
hours per week at a much lower peak rate, producing a saving of 89 per cent in 
electricity consumption. Visibility is greater which has led to an increase in staff 
productivity.
In addition, Miniclipper decided to add:
●
●sensors to every warehouse fitting in the Hi-bay which aligns each light with 
activity, therefore varying according to productivity and business peaks;
●
●movement sensors for offices/toilets/canteen/packing area;
●
●daylight level sensors for external canopy lights and floodlit loading areas; and
●
●a new emergency lighting system which ensured they met health and safety 
legislation.
2  Solar energy
The next step was to achieve carbon neutrality and produce their own energy for the 
lighting. This they did by installing solar panels to the roofs of their warehouses. With 
the projected generation from the solar panels at >40,000 kWh, this will completely 
offset the energy used for the Hi-bay lighting.
See Figure 16.3 below (photograph courtesy of Miniclipper logistics).

The Warehouse and the Environment
369
3  Waste management
ISO14001 accreditation led to a full review of their environmental policy and 
communication with their employees.
An example of procedures they have introduced are as follows:
●
●Wood, plastic, paper, card and metal is separated and recycled and removed by 
three recycling companies.
●
●Two balers are installed (one plastic, one cardboard) and staff trained to use.
●
●Office paper is shredded and used as packing materials in warehouse.
●
●No plastic/paper cups used in office areas.
●
●90 per cent of incoming cardboard boxes are reused for packing.
●
●No general waste goes to landfill.
In 2011 very little waste material was recycled; in 2012 over 6 tonnes of waste was 
certified as recycled.
Miniclipper Logistics has found that promoting and pursuing carbon reduction 
policies are not only good for the environment but have a positive benefit on the 
bottom line. A real win–win situation.
The environment and waste
Waste is something which the holder or producer discards. If something is dis-
carded then it will remain waste until it has gone through what is known as a 
‘recovery operation’.
In the UK if you store, treat or dispose of another person’s waste you need 
to hold an environmental permit, be technically competent and be regulated by 
the Environment Agency.
It is an offence to store, treat or dispose of waste without either an environ-
mental permit or an exemption. There is also personal responsibility on directors 
and managers to ensure there is no breach of the legislation, and they can be 
prosecuted personally.
A holder of waste has a duty of care to ensure it is deposited or transferred 
to an authorized person.
Overall, to comply with the duty you must take reasonable steps to:
●
●prevent the escape of waste whilst you hold it;
●
●transfer it to an authorized (suitably licensed) person; and
●
●provide written information which identifies and describes the waste 
being transferred.

Warehouse Management
370
To avoid a breach of Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 you 
need to prevent waste causing pollution or harm to the environment either 
when it is under your control or when the waste is transferred.
Other regimes for specific waste types include the Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. This affects, but is not limited to,  
importers, manufacturers, retailers and business users.
If you export WEEE you have to be approved by the Environment Agency 
and issue evidence notes when you receive whole WEEE appliances. You must 
also have systems and procedures in place to ensure you provide accurate  
reports to the Environment Agency. If you produce WEEE you are obliged to 
join a compliance scheme.
Packaging
Product packaging has a significant impact on the sustainability of the supply 
chain as a whole.
There are three main types of packaging, according to Envirowise, a UK 
government agency:
●
●Primary (sales) packaging. This is the packaging around a product at the 
point of purchase by the user/consumer. Examples include bottles, tins, 
plastic covers or wrapping.
●
●Secondary (grouped) packaging. This packaging groups a number of 
items together until the point of sale. Examples include an inner or 
outer box and strapping which binds a number of items together.
●
●Tertiary (transport) packaging. This packaging allows handling and 
transportation of a number of grouped items as a single unit load. Over 
recent years the mainstays of returnable transit packaging (RTP), the 
wooden pallet and the metal stillage, have been joined by many other 
forms of RTP. These include plastic pallets, tote boxes and metal cages.
There are many reasons for reducing packaging costs. These include:
●
●Lower packaging costs mean higher profits.
●
●Waste minimization benefits your own company and the environment.
By carefully segregating its waste into cardboard, plastics and general waste, 
one food contract packaging company reduced its waste removal costs by  
45 per cent and is now recovering approximately 30 per cent of its packaging.
It is possible to significantly reduce packaging costs and cut waste levels by 
implementing relatively simple measures, many with low or no associated 
costs; or, if there is a cost, payback is relatively quick.

The Warehouse and the Environment

Taking action on waste packaging will:
●
●increase overall profitability;
●
●increase staff awareness of environmental and cost-saving issues;
●
●develop closer relationships with suppliers and customers through 
shared benefits and cost savings;
●
●reduce the use of finite resources;
●
●reduce the volume of waste going to landfill;
●
●reduce product damage;
●
●enhance environmental performance;
●
●promote a better company image;
●
●meet current and future obligations under packaging waste regulations 
at least possible cost.
Packaging design
Although the majority of waste initiatives begin at the design stage and are 
mainly the concern of the production department, the warehouse can have a 
significant influence on the amount of packaging used.
When designing product packaging there needs to be an input from the 
warehouse operation. For example, secondary packaging needs to fit the actual 
pallet dimensions. Any overhang on the pallet can lead to packaging damage, 
an increase in the amount of stretch wrap required and potential issues when 
the product is put away in the racking.
Pallets
Although the mainstay of transit packaging over many years, the pallet can be 
replaced or at least augmented by other forms of tertiary packaging.
For example, an alternative to the use of pallets where the products are 
lightweight in design include slip sheets and corrugated trays. Not only do they 
reduce the use of wooden pallets but they are lighter, take up less space in a 
container, for example, and are significantly cheaper, especially in circum-
stances where pallets are not returned.
However, if your operation necessitates the use of pallets there needs to be a 
process in place to track and recover pallets. A current client is spending in 
excess of €800,000 on wooden stillages that are left at customer premises. In 
such cases alternative methods of encasing and transporting the product need 

Warehouse Management
372
to be evaluated. These can include collapsible metal stillages which, although 
more expensive to produce initially, can be returned for reuse without signi­
ficantly reducing the back-loading abilities of the delivery vehicles.
Utilizing recycled pallets can have a number of advantages over new pallets. 
They are likely to be cheaper and potentially stronger as a result of seasoning, 
which increases the strength of the wood. They are also exempt from packag-
ing waste regulations.
Plastic pallets which are recyclable are also a potential alternative albeit they 
take more energy to produce, are more expensive at the outset and will require 
a robust system to track their whereabouts.
Stretch wrap
Suppliers can end up using excessive stretch wrap to stabilize product on a  
pallet. Alternatives include banding. Although a capital purchase, stretch-wrap 
machines can reduce the usage of wrap and make the unit load more stable.
Cartons
As with many of the topics we have discussed in relation to the warehouse 
operation, packaging again results in trade-offs.
A significant trade-off is the strength of the packaging and potentially less 
damage versus the additional cost of the packaging. A current client is having 
to replace packaging received from the Far East on a regular basis as a result of 
substandard cardboard.
When picking individual items from secondary packaging there is going to 
be a surplus of cartons. Where possible, cartons should be reused.
The replacement of cardboard packaging with plastic totes is possible. 
However, a robust system of tracking and tracing the equipment needs to be 
in place. Some companies are now embedding RFID chips into their reusable 
packaging.
Labelling
When labelling product in the warehouse it is advisable not to use paper labels 
that cannot be easily removed. Some plastic re-processors will not accept plastics 
contaminated with paper.

The Warehouse and the Environment
373
Product waste
Poor stock rotation can lead to waste with out-of-date items. FIFO systems 
must be applied to minimize out-of-life stock.
Waste disposal
If packaging cannot be reused, look to reduce disposal costs by segregating the 
waste correctly and, where feasible, selling it to waste recyclers or re-processors. 
You can also set it against the purchase of packaging recovery notes.
Hazardous waste
Something is hazardous if it is dangerous to people, animals or the environ-
ment. You should first check the goods are as stated in the consignment/transfer 
note and follow your own acceptance criteria. If the goods are later found to 
be hazardous you may become the producer of the hazardous waste and will 
need to comply with the legislation governing this specific waste type.
Forklift trucks
Electric lift trucks are superior to internal combustion engine models when  
it comes to the environment. Indoor air quality is improved by eliminating  
internal combustion exhaust within a facility.
If utilizing electric lift trucks, it is not necessary to vent outside air into a 
facility to offset internal combustion exhaust or to exchange air as frequently 
through heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which is good for 
the environment and has the added benefit of reducing heating and air- 
conditioning costs.
If electricity is generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar power, 
then electric lift trucks are truly emission free. However, the environmental 
impact of an electric truck is more than just being emission free. Electric trucks 
use no engine oil, transmission fluid, radiator fluid or filters that have to be 
changed on a regular basis. These waste items can be very harmful to the  
environment if they are not handled and disposed of properly (Hyster 2010).

Warehouse Management
374
There is another school of thought according to Johnson (2008), however, 
that ‘fuel carbon footprints of electric and LPG forklifts are, in principle, about 
equal, while in actual practice, LPG’s footprint is smaller than that of electricity’.
Toyota has recently introduced a new Geneo-Hybrid forklift truck which  
is expected to cut CO2 emissions and fuel consumption by 50 per cent while 
delivering the operational performance of an equivalent conventional diesel-
powered forklift.
Summary and conclusion
A major challenge across all industry sectors today is ensuring a sustainable 
supply chain.
Clearly, there are solutions on the market that can help warehouses operate 
in a more sustainable way. By combining available technologies and solutions 
in terms of energy savings, heating and cooling systems, and alternative energy 
sources, a warehouse can be designed that emits 70 per cent less CO2 than the 
typical 15-year-old warehouse (Prologis 2007).
We must also encourage staff to be responsible in terms of energy efficiency 
within the warehouse. Turning off lights and electronic equipment when not  
in use, and switching off forklift trucks when idling are only a few ways of  
increasing energy efficiency.

The warehouse 
of the future
The best way to predict your future is to create it.
(Abraham Lincoln)
Introduction
When I set out to write the first edition of this book I didn’t think I’d be fol-
lowing it up with a second edition so quickly. The continuing challenges faced 
by companies including omni-channel retailing, significant reductions in order 
lead times, environmental and staffing pressures have suppliers, users and  
academics looking at ways to overcome these challenges. New technology is 
continually being introduced and, as Mark Strand says, the future is now in 
many respects. Concepts such as fully automated warehouses, carbon-neutral 
buildings, hybrid trucks, robotics, voice operations and optically guided picking 
are all in their various stages of development.
What of the warehouse of the future? One revolutionary product or process 
is 3D printing – what effect will this have on the warehouse of the future?
This section will look at the likely role of the warehouse in the supply chain 
in the future, what it might look like and the new technology which will poten-
tially have a significant effect on warehouses in the future.
Context
First we need to put things into context and be aware that warehousing in the 
future will be affected by many factors, such as:
●
●Globally we have a growing but ageing population. This means that 
land will be at a premium but also there are likely to be labour 
shortages in key areas, which suggests a potential growth in automation 
but also the need for elder friendly workplaces.
17

●
●The growing economies of not only the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, 
India, China and South Africa) but also those of the developing world 
where consumerism and the growth of the internet will put even greater 
pressure on consumer product manufacturers and their warehouses. 
Consumer awareness and demand for new products and services will 
continue to increase.
●
●As economies grow and the population gets older there will be greater 
competition for staff. Warehousing has not been a career of choice for 
many people because of its image according to a recent PWC report 
(2012) and companies are going to have market themselves better to 
become more attractive to today’s youth.
●
●Sustainability will play a significant role in supply chain operations in 
the future. The green lobby will look to the supply chain for initiatives 
in terms of alternative energy use, reduction in CO2 emissions, reduction 
in waste, reduction in water usage and the use of alternative forms of 
transport. This will include intermodal transport initiatives as well as 
fuel-efficient MHE. Consumers and retailers will also be encouraged to 
source local products, leading to an increase in demand for 
neighbourhood warehouses.
●
●Fuel and energy costs will continue to rise as fossil fuels continue to 
decline. Companies will look to warehouse automation and the use of 
greener vehicles whilst developers and warehouse operators will be 
encouraged to consider solar panels, wind turbines and the use of waste 
product for energy production.
●
●The potential introduction of government taxation initiatives to 
encourage companies to reduce their impact on the environment.
●
●An increasing pressure on companies to collaborate and share resources. 
Many warehouses and, for that matter, transport modes are under-
utilized, so pressure from the green lobby and also continued pressure 
to further reduce costs will encourage companies to collaborate.
●
●Technology will continue to improve, evolve and become more 
affordable. As has been proven time and again, the next big idea is 
likely to be just around the corner.
According to Kewill (2013) Generation Z/the post-90s generation have entered 
the market, as both consumers and employees. Having grown up using e-mail, 
social networking and communications technology such as mobile/smart 
phones, MP3 players, laptops/tablets and games consoles, they have never 
known a world without them. Adept at switching between multiple platforms, 
formats and devices, they expect to utilize the technology they are familiar with 
in the work environment, accelerating the prevalence of Bring Your Own 

The Warehouse of the Future
377
Device (BYOD) in industries heavily reliant on the timely transfer of data, such 
as logistics.
Views of the future: the landscape
Capgemini (2010), writing about the supply chain, see the characteristics of the 
2016 future supply chain as follows:
●
●The future model will be based on multi-partner information sharing 
amongst key stakeholders: consumers (the originators of the demand 
signal, either from home or from a store), suppliers, manufacturers, 
logistics service providers and retailers.
●
●Once produced, products will be shipped to collaborative warehouses  
in which multiple manufacturers store their products. Collaborative 
transport from the collaborative warehouse will deliver to city hubs  
and to regional consolidation centres.
●
●Warehouse locations on the edge of cities will be reshaped to function 
as hubs where cross docking will take place for final distribution. 
Non-urban areas will have regional consolidation centres in which 
products will be cross docked for final distribution.
●
●Final distribution to stores, pick-up points and homes in urban and 
non-urban areas will take place via consolidated deliveries using 
efficient assets.
As we can see from Figures 17.1 and 17.2, warehouses will remain a vital cog 
in the supply chain, becoming consolidation centres, regional hubs and shared-
use facilities for a variety of manufacturers and products.
Although there are many shared-user operations currently in place, including 
retail consolidation centres, Capgemini’s vision of collaborative warehousing 
takes it to another level.
They see the key point being that both retailers and manufacturers collabo-
rate even more closely by extending the consolidation centre premise to cover 
multiple retailers, thus ensuring greater warehouse utilization and full truck-
load deliveries in all directions. This is borne out by recent surveys such as 
those by Kewill, Savills and others who cite collaboration and shared user 
warehouses as being one of the future solutions for cost reduction and the 
shortage of labour.
To succeed, this concept will require high levels of trust and commitment 
among manufacturers, retailers and logistics service providers, but it is a crucial 
enabler for realizing integrated sustainability improvements.

This is likely to be one of the main stumbling blocks and it will require 
third-party logistics companies to play a greater role by being more proactive 
and brokering agreements between all three parties and also taking some of  
the risk.
Views of the future: the warehouse
What of the warehouse itself?
I’m certain that those of us who grew up in the sixties and seventies would 
not have predicted that mobile phones and computers, although I use the terms 
loosely in this context, would have had the impact on communications that 
they have today. Nor that such powerful devices could be packaged into such 
small units.
The other phenomenon has been the internet and the effect it has on the  
way we do business today. This leads me on to the role of the warehouse in the 
future.
Some would argue that there won’t be a requirement for stocked ware-
houses as companies will manage their supply chains so well that cross docking 
or transhipment will be the norm and therefore warehouses will become transit 
sheds, parcel and pallet hubs.
Secondly, with the growth in e-retailing there will be more fulfilment and 
returns centres as opposed to warehouses. In addition, with the increase in fuel 
costs there may be an argument for production becoming more localized and 
therefore warehouses will become an extension of the production plant once 
again. This should lead to a more just-in-time method of order fulfilment.
For those of us who subscribe to the view that warehouses will still exist 
some time into the future, what function will they perform and what will they 
look like?
The current trend seems to be towards greater centralization of warehous-
ing, with retailers building bigger sheds with more automation, replacing 
smaller regional centres.
Others argue that the rising cost of fuel and customer demand for shorter 
lead times will result in a greater number of local warehouses.
These centres will act as replenishment centres for stores, and continued 
growth in e-retailing will increase home delivery significantly.
On this point, orders to the warehouse will grow appreciably but the number 
of lines and items per order will be small. Thus where individual items are  
ordered by consumers over the internet there will be a greater need for techno-
logical solutions and quicker, more accurate methods of order picking and 
despatch.

The Warehouse of the Future
381
Automation will play a big part in the warehouse of the future and it is 
likely that we will have many types of robots criss-crossing the floor, collecting 
and depositing pallets, cartons and totes to wherever they are needed, with very 
few humans in sight.
Conveyors will abound and robots will move both horizontally and vertically, 
making full use of the cube of the warehouse. Radio frequency sensors will be 
placed strategically throughout the warehouse to ensure that there aren’t any 
breaks in transmission and to guide the various automated equipment.
We humans will no doubt still be involved in some capacity but mainly as 
IT and equipment service engineers. Skilled pickers will still have a place on the 
warehouse floor where goods-to-picker systems will continue to play their part. 
Staff will also be required for various value-added tasks such as re-packing, 
kimballing and kitting.
In order for this to work efficiently, everything will need to be uniform. 
Pallets will need to be the same size – no combinations of UK, US, euro or print 
pallets, for example. Cartons will also need to be standardized. Alternatively, 
goods will be moved in plastic, returnable and recyclable totes.
As for the building itself it is likely to be built with sustainability in mind.
The warehouses will operate 24 hours per day. From an environmental 
standpoint, the warehouse roofs will have solar panels and the yards will be 
full of wind turbines, not only to run the warehouse but also to produce energy 
to recharge the electric vehicles which make the deliveries.
The equipment will be regenerative and all operations will benefit from 
energy-efficient lighting and heating.
The majority of warehouses are likely to be high bay (at least 12 metre eaves 
according to the BNP Paribas report) with some lower height warehouses or 
sections of warehouses to act as cross docking operations. The continued 
growth in third-party logistics and shared-user warehousing is also likely to see 
larger warehouses with the potential for sub-division.
The increase in product lines could also see greater use of mezzanine floors.
As for location, port-centric logistics is increasing in popularity together with 
the increased use of rail transportation which suggests coastal locations or those 
linked by inland waterways and rail.
Finally there will be a requirement for greater flexibility with shorter lease terms.
The following are potential scenarios for the future of warehousing. Scenario 
one looks at the use of technology to its utmost whilst Scenario two suggests 
that we humans will continue to play a significant role in warehouse operations.
Scenario one
As a vehicle arrives on site its RFID tag will be read and the vehicle guided to 
the relevant loading bay. On reaching the bay its roller shutter door will open, 

Warehouse Management
382
as will the loading bay door, and the rails within the trailer will connect to rails 
within the warehouse. The conveyor will be activated and the pallets will be 
unloaded. Each pallet will move through a portal where each pallet and item 
tag will be read and the data sent direct to the WMS. An AGV will take the 
pallet to its relevant location, be it the despatch bay for cross docking or  
into deep storage. If the products are destined for the pick section they will be 
de-layered robotically and each layer of product placed into a tote for onward 
delivery to the mini-load AS/RS storage area. Suppliers will be informed of any 
discrepancies and their payments adjusted accordingly.
The system will control all of the movements within the warehouse with no 
requirement to print pick lists, communicate with PDAs or send voice instruc-
tions to us humans. The paperless warehouse should become a reality (unlike 
the paperless office which has been much heralded but never achieved).
All items are RFID tagged and are tracked throughout the warehouse.
Once an order is received the mini-load system will send the tote containing 
the product(s) to a pick station and a robot with suction pads will read the 
RFID chip or compare its image with that of the order, pick up the item and 
place it into another tote or carton for despatch. This task may be done by a 
human if the robot’s dexterity is called into question.
The tote will be placed on a conveyor, a lid fitted together with a destination 
label and it will be loaded onto a waiting vehicle.
The problem will be how to manage complexity. The requirement for indi-
vidual items to be picked from cartons will continue to pose problems for a 
fully automated warehouse. The growth of internet shopping and orders for 
individual items will continue to pose challenges to warehouse operators, so 
human intervention will still be a fundamental requirement.
Robot dexterity may be improved but this could be at the risk of slowing 
down the operation as a whole.
It may be that robots, conveyors and AGVs will bring the products to the 
operator but the actual act of picking and packing could well remain with the 
operator.
Scenario two
There is an argument that people will continue to be used for specific opera-
tions within the warehouse. For example, people are currently able to pick  
individual items faster and more cost effectively than a fully automated system.
The following is an example of how the present and the future are coming 
together with most of this technology in place individually but not yet com-
bined into a single operation.
This is a concept system called Aria put forward by LXE, a leading manu-
facturer of mobile computers.

The Warehouse of the Future
383
We have also incorporated Jungheinrich’s RFID warehouse navigation system.
The concept covers both inbound and outbound operations and is heavily 
reliant on the introduction of RFID technology.
The arrival of a delivery at the security gate triggers a message to the ware-
house operator from the WMS via their headset, which is attached to a mobile 
computer worn on their arm, belt or installed on their lift truck, to ‘Go to dock 
door 34’.
The door opens and the RFID reader on the lift truck automatically reads 
the RFID transponders in the floor and takes the truck and driver to the correct 
location. A tag on the dock door confirms that they are at the correct location.
The RFID reader then automatically reads the pallet tag which contains a 
unique EPC code associated with the pallet and the shipper. The WMS retrieves 
the electronic ASN referenced by the RFID tag.
Based on the ASN data, the WMS issues any QC instructions (damage 
checks, case counts, etc) to the operator via either the mobile computer screen 
or headset.
After the operator validates that any QC tasks are complete, the WMS does 
an auto-receive of the pallet.
The WMS then tells the operator via voice to take the pallet to aisle 07  
and deposit it at the pick and drop location. This repetitive movement can be 
replaced by an AGV.
A message is sent to the very narrow aisle truck operator that there is a 
pallet awaiting put-away. The RFID reader on the truck follows a particular 
path set out by the WMS to arrive at the correct location. Upon arriving at 
the pick and drop point in aisle 07 the RFID reader on the operator’s truck 
auto-confirms the operator’s location by reading an RFID tag embedded in 
the rack.
When the pallet is deposited in the location, the RFID reader notifies the 
WMS that the task has been completed correctly. The WMS completes the 
transaction and updates the inventory location record.
Once completed, a further message is sent to the operator to retrieve a pallet 
from aisle 07 location 0105 and take it to pick location 012101.
A member of the picking team receives a message via their headset to go to 
pick location 012101.
A laser-guided truck is despatched from the outbound bay, having collected 
an empty pallet, to meet the picker at location 012101. On arrival at location 
012101, the RFID reader on the operator’s arm and on the truck auto-confirms 
the truck and operator’s location by reading an RFID tag embedded in the floor 
or on the rack.
The operator is instructed to pick three cases. The warehouse operator then 
places three boxes on the pallet. The RFID system confirms that the correct 
product has been picked in the correct quantity.

Warehouse Management
384
If the wrong product or quantity is picked, the system immediately commu-
nicates appropriate corrective action at the pick location where the problem 
can be resolved with minimal disruption and expense.
The picker and the truck continue to the remaining locations on the pick 
list. Once completed, the truck departs for the despatch bay while the picker 
awaits the next instruction.
The advantages of such a system include the following:
●
●high levels of accuracy;
●
●driving to wrong location is eliminated;
●
●reduction in order-picking mistakes;
●
●greater operator comfort;
●
●less stress for the driver;
●
●up to 25 per cent higher pick rate;
●
●higher order-picking quality;
●
●distance and time optimization;
●
●saves energy;
●
●distance optimization means energy optimization; and
●
●reduction in lighting within aisles is possible (‘pick by light on truck’).
Other advances
Technology that is just around the corner includes Knapp’s optically guided 
picking system. The picker wears a camera and is guided by the system to each 
required pick location using superimposed arrow symbols directly in the field 
of vision of the operator via a head-mounted display. There is a countdown in 
terms of the metres left to travel. At the pick location the goods to be picked 
are identified for the picker and the camera reads barcodes, lot numbers and 
serial numbers to confirm the pick without any further human intervention.  
A digital display will show the number of items to be picked.
Once established, it is thought that the system will prove even more accurate 
than voice, and the head-mounted equipment will be the same weight and  
design as a normal pair of glasses.
As with voice-directed picking, training is quick and allows operators to 
keep both hands free for picking.

The Warehouse of the Future
385
One other piece of technology I want to share with you is 3D printing or additive 
manufacturing.
3D Printing was originally developed as an automated method of producing 
prototypes. Although there are several competing technologies, most work on the 
basis of building up layers of material (sometimes plastic, ceramics or even metal 
powders) using a computer aided design. Hence, it is referred to as an ‘additive’ 
process; each layer is ‘printed’ until a three dimensional product is created.
A report by Transport Intelligence suggests that 3D printing ‘is already very 
good at producing products (even with moving parts) which previously would 
have required the assembly of multiple components’, and that by ‘eliminating 
the assembly phase there will be huge savings for the manufacturer in terms  
of labor costs’. 3D printing-based production could also reduce or eliminate 
storage, handling and distribution costs.
People will be able to print a required item at home providing they have the 
scanned image or the blueprints of the product itself.
The report goes on to say that ‘A major new sector of the logistics industry 
will emerge dealing with the storage and movement of the raw materials which 
“feed” the 3D printers. As 3D printers become more affordable to the general 
public, the home delivery market of these materials will increase.’
Global and national parts warehouses as well as forward stock locations 
will become unnecessary. At present billions are spent on holding stock to  
supply parts to products as diverse as cars and x-ray machines. In some cases  
a huge amount of redundancy is built into supply chains to enable parts to be 
dispatched in a very short timescale to get machines up and running again as 
fast as possible.
The Service Parts Logistics industry will be either transformed or decimated 
by 3D manufacturing – or perhaps both! With small 3D Printing machines 
available, operations in remote locations – or even in an engineer’s van – will 
only need electronic libraries of designs available to them on a local computer. 
They can then call up the design of the spare part required and immediately 
print it. Obsolete parts could simply be scanned in 3D, fixed in the computer’s 
memory and the new part printed. The implications for inventory are clear.

Summary and conclusion
Warehouses in highly developed countries will no doubt adopt the latest 
technology, and companies whose products can absorb the high initial capital 
investment will be at the forefront of warehouse automation.

Warehouse Management
386
However, as discussed previously, automation is not for everyone, and ware-
houses will continue to hold stock and employ staff to receive, put away, pick 
and despatch products.
It is hoped that this book has given you, the reader, an insight into ware-
house operations in the 21st century. Although investment in technology will 
improve and speed up operations, changes in processes, attitudes and improved 
communication both internally and externally are the stepping stones. These 
need to be firmly in place and cannot be by-passed under any circumstances 
prior to any thoughts of automation.
The growth in e-commerce will continue to challenge warehouse managers 
globally and the change in profile from full-carton and full-pallet picks to indi-
vidual-item picks will have equipment manufacturers seeking the holy grail of 
pick systems. Whatever that may be.
One thing is certain: we cannot afford to stand still. US Rear Admiral Grace 
Hopper (1906–92) once said, ‘The most damaging phrase in the language is: 
“It’s always been done that way.”’
This is a statement I have heard many times in my career and therefore  
I hope this book has given you some new ideas to think about and hopefully 
you will be able to implement them and they will help you improve efficiency 
and minimize costs.

Two-Dimensional (2D) barcode symbologies contain information in both 
the X and Y axis of the symbol. In other words, there is different data encoded 
in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the code. To properly decode 
the data, a scanner must read the entire symbol, in both dimensions simul-
taneously. This can be done by sweeping the scan line (in the case of a laser 
or linear imaging scanner) over the symbol, or by using a 2D array equipped 
scanner, which acts as a camera. Since the data can be stored in two dimen-
sions, 2D barcode symbologies allow vast amounts of data to be stored.
There are two kinds of 2D barcode symbologies: stacked codes and matrix 
codes. Stacked codes consist of multiple layers of linear barcodes and matrix 
codes encode data using cells within a matrix.
Examples of stacked codes are:
PDF 417; Character Set: Alphanumeric (uppercase/lowercase), 
punctuation, controls Character Size: Variable-length; Fault 
Tolerance: High; Application: Driver licenses, transportation, 
inventory management, government
Codablock F; Character Set: Numeric only; Character Size: Up to  
5,450 characters variable-length; Fault Tolerance: High;  
Application: Healthcare
Examples of Matrix codes are:
Data Matrix; Character Set: Alphanumeric, Uppercase/Lowercase 
Letters, Punctuation, Controls; Character Size: Up to 2,335 
characters fixed-length; Fault Tolerance: High; Application: Marking 
small items, printed on labels and letters, industrial engineering for 
marketing components
Q R C ode; Character Set: Alphanumeric, Uppercase/Lowercase Letters, 
Punctuation, Controls. Includes Kanji characters; Character Size:  
Up to 7,000 numeric characters or 4,296 alpha characters variable 
length; Fault Tolerance: High; Application: Automobile 
manufacturing, mobile phone codes
