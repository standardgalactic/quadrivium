 NEW CARS   
When a car, truck or motorcycle is produFion-
ready, PM’s auto editors are there ﬁrﬆ. Our  
editors and professional drivers take you behind 
the wheel, teﬆing handling, acceleration and the 
high-tech innovations in new vehicles long before 
you can buy them. Whether we’re roaring through 
laps on the race track, canyon-carving or hypermil-
ing on the highway, we’ll tell you everything the 
automakers did right—and what they got wrong.

 ELECTRIC HYBRIDS   
If there’s an eleFric vehicle on the road—whether 
two-, three- or four-wheeled—chances are we’ve 
driven it. Re prototype plug-in Toyota Prius, the 
Ford Fusion Hybrid, the 100-mpg eleFric Hummer 
and plenty more high-tech vehicles have faced our 
road teﬆs. Check back for more on how the lateﬆ 
eleFric and hybrid eleFric vehicles hold up in 
real-world driving. popularmechanics.com/phev
 LONG-TERM RELIABILITY  
Sometimes even a 300-mile drive isn’t enough to 
reveal every detail on a new car or truck. Rat’s 
why PM’s auto editors have a ﬂeet of vehicles that 
we submit to year-long reliability teﬆs. Check in for 
weekly comments and full quarterly updates.

Forget the Landﬁll 
I very much enjoyed your 
ﬆory “3e Soul of an Old

to repair and ﬁx rather than 
discard produKs. I too enjoy 
the challenge of ﬁxing 
something, even if juﬆ for the 
satisfaKion of accomplishing 
the task. Recently I helped a 
neighbor diagnose a problem 
with his 30-year-old wood 
splitter. 3e coﬆ of replacing

$4 plus some replacement 
hydraulic ﬂuid. Bottom line:  
We saved $1500 and a lot of

America’s produFion of biodiesel, fuel derived 
from plants and animal fats inﬆead of petroleum, 
is reeling from changes in the market. Soy and 
animal-fat prices have risen, oil prices have fallen, and the 
European Union has levied tariﬀs on U.S.-made biodiesel. 
Rese forces have helped shutter dozens of biodiesel 
plants, including those owned by GreenHunter Energy, the 
nation’s largeﬆ operator. Re Environmental ProteFion 
Agency mandates that a growing percentage of alternative 
energy options be blended into conventional vehicle fuel, 
but biodiesel produFion may fall short of the law’s 2010 
targets. ProduFion is expeFed to rise in 2011, thanks 
partly to federal grants and loan guarantees.

It takes more than juﬆ a vehicle to convince 
consumers to adopt ele4ric cars. Recharging their 
batteries has to be as easy as ﬁlling up a tank of gas. 
Israel-born entrepreneur Shai Agassi, the founder of the 
ﬆartup company Better Place, is relying on robotic 
quick-change ﬆations to swap out depleted batteries for 
fresh ones in the ele4ric cars he is servicing. Drivers will 
enter a ﬆation when their battery pack gets low and have 
the battery replaced faﬆer than it would take to reﬁll a 
gasoline tank. “When ele4ric cars are more aﬀordable and convenient than 
gas cars, consumer adoption will tip the market,” Agassi says. Better Place 
proposes building a network of curbside charging ﬆations where owners can 
top oﬀ their vehicle batteries. Agassi’s idea generated $300 million in venture 
capital and sparked international intereﬆ: Cities in Israel and Denmark hope 
to have the ﬁrﬆ robotic change ﬆations running in 2011, and the company 
aspires to expand operations to Auﬆralia, Canada, Hawaii and California in 
2012. In late September, Better Place signed a deal with Renault-Nissan to 
put 100,000 ele4ric vehicles on the road in Israel and Denmark by 2016.

batteries along 
with the 
infraﬆru5ure for 
servicing them.

Like ele5ric cars 
currently on the 
market, the Better 
Place model has 
an ele5ric plug so 
that drivers can 
top oﬀ at curbside 
charging ﬆations.

GPS-enabled 
so9ware in the 
car alerts drivers 
when they’re 
running low on 
battery power  
and dire5s them 
to the neareﬆ 
quick-change 
ﬆation along  
their route.  e 
so9ware could 
also interface  
with future power-
monitoring 
technology to 
feed power from 
parked cars  
back into the 
ele5rical grid.
An automated syﬆem accesses the battery beneath the car.
→ 1. Re driver swipes a card to aFivate the syﬆem, then drives into the change  
ﬆation. → 2. A robot quickly releases the battery pack from the undercarriage and 
exchanges it for a new one. → 3.Time from drive-in to drive-out: 1 minute 30 seconds.

Aiming weapons from a 
ﬆealth aircra+ like the F-35 is 
not easy. 6e infrared sensors used 
to ﬁnd targets in the air and on the 
ground need a 360-degree view, so 
they muﬆ hang outside the airframe. 
However, the shape of any exterior 
hardware produces a telltale 
signature on enemy radar, so 
Lockheed Martin engineers put the 
targeting optics in a multifaceted 
sapphire ﬆruGure jutting out of the 
fuselage under the aircra+’s nose. 
“6e material is the same as you ﬁnd 
in a supermarket checkout bar-code 
scanner,” says Don Bolling, Lock-
heed’s business development 
manager for the eleGro-optical 
targeting syﬆem (EOTS). From the

 Sometimes a 
single bad day can 
reshape an entire 
military service. /e 
U.S. Air Force was 
humiliated in late 
2007 when 
aircrews unwittingly 
loaded six live 
nuclear warheads 
onto a B-52 
bomber, believing 
them to be 
unarmed cruise 
missiles. /e nukes 
were missing for 
36 hours, ﬂying 
from Minot Air 
Force Base in 
North Dakota to 
Barksdale Air Force 
Base in Louisiana, 
before anyone 
noticed. /e top 
brass relieved four 
oﬃcers of their 
commands and 
decertiﬁed 65 
airmen from handling 
nuclear weapons, 
but  the Air Force’s 
poﬆ–Cold War 
negleH of its 
nuclear missions 
had been exposed. 
In response, the 
Pentagon decided 
in OHober 2008 to 
consolidate 
responsibility for 
its ﬂeet of 
nuclear-capable 
bombers and 
land-based 
intercontinental 
balliﬆic missile 
missions under the 
watchful eye of a 
single command. 
/e Global Strike 
Command takes 
charge of the 
ICBMs this month 
in Barksdale, but 
moﬆ of the 
nuclear-capable 
B-2 and B-52 
bombers will trans-
fer to the new 
command in 
February.  — J.P.

Forensic scientiﬆs work with law enforcement to locate and identify 
corpses at crime scenes and in the wake of disaﬆers. Forensic teams 
typically rely on highly trained cadaver dogs that are expensive to maintain. DNA or 
dental records are then used to determine a recovered body’s identity. Although 
these well-honed methods are considered the gold ﬆandard, forensic experts are 
faced with scenarios where these conventional tools are impraBical, as when the 
body is badly decomposed or buried by debris. Cese new tools are being developed.

magnetic ﬁeld is so ﬆrong that it aﬀeBs the water in the animal’s tissues, 
prompting a repulsive magnetic force that suspends the rodent in the air. It 
takes a superconduBing magnet operating at minus 456 F to ﬂoat a 
10-gram mouse within a 2.6-inch bore, which is kept at room temperature. 
Ce magnetic ﬁeld is applied evenly to keep the mice hovering in place, and

Roland Emmerich is no ﬆranger to cinematic 
disaﬆer. Re direFor froze New York City in 8e Day 
A"er Tomorrow and blew the White House to bits in 
Independence Day. So he wasn’t sure about direFing 2012, 
out Nov. 13. Re movie is based on the idea that the end of 
the Mayan calendar on Dec. 21, 2012, portends a global 
apocalypse. “When I realized how much disaﬆer was 
involved I got a case of cold feet, because I’ve done that, 
you know?” he says. “So I said, ‘Okay, I’m going to make this 
the mother of all disaﬆer movies.’ ” 
More than 100 artiﬆs created 2012’s 1300 visual 
eﬀeFs (VFX) shots, including volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, 
ﬂoods—and a massive earthquake that rips California 
apart. In this 3-minute sequence, failed science-ﬁFion 
writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) drives through Los 
Angeles as the city crumbles around him. In the paﬆ, 
Emmerich might have ﬁlmed on location and swapped in 
CG crumbling buildings, but that approach didn’t make 
sense for 2012 because every ediﬁce had to be deﬆroyed. 
Inﬆead, artiﬆs at Uncharted Territory built a 3D photoreal-
iﬆic version of several city blocks using 60,000 high-
dynamic images as a reference. Ren they made every 
mailbox, tree and building shake and crumble—and each 
item had to be researched to see how it would behave. 
As animators molded the virtual city, Emmerich was 
ﬁlming his aFors in front of a blue screen. He put the aFors 
on a “shaky ﬂoor,” an 8000-square-foot ﬆeel platform on 
airbags. Special-eﬀeFs coordinators jiggled the bags with 
pneumatic pumps to inspire authentic reaFions from the 
aFors.  “It was the moﬆ complicated scene we created,” 
Emmerich says. “And it’s one of my favorites.”

Using that informa-
tion, software

and re-creates that 
movement inside

looks tough enough to run 
ﬆraight down the Baja 
Peninsula, race across the 
Mexican mainland and 
then continue roaring 
down through South 
America until it plows 
across AntarFica. It is the 
moﬆ extreme high-speed 
4x4 pickup ever produced. 
It looks simply ferocious 
with its swollen ﬂanks, 
aggressive ﬆance, visibly 
rugged suspension pieces 
and thumping 35-inch-tall 
BF Goodrich oﬀ-road tires. 
Xe powertrain is ﬆill pure 
F-150, with a 320-hp 
5.4-liter V8 linked to a 
six-speed automatic, 
though an exclusive 
400-hp 6.2-liter “Boss” 
V8 will soon become an 
option. Engineers 
widened the F-150’s track 
by 7 inches with new 
upper and lower control 
arms. Xe lower arms are 
chamfered like a 
skidplate, so rocks can 
slide underneath without 
hanging the truck up. To 
allow the Raptor to glide 
over obﬆacles and take 
the punishment of hard 
landings, the Special 
Vehicle Team (SVT) chose 
speciﬁcally tuned 
internal-bypass Fox 
Racing shocks. Xere’s 
nothing exotic about how 
the Raptor moves over 
pavement. But the thrills 
oﬀ-road are mighty 
indeed—the truck is 
absolutely magical. 
Whoops, whoop-dees and 
whoop-dee-doos all get 
swallowed up by the 
Raptor’s suspension with 
casual disdain. At speeds 
that would lead to jail 
time when praFiced on 
any interﬆate, the Raptor 
can cruise over yard-deep 
gullies as if they were 
speed bumps at a 
Wal-Mart. Amazingly, 
while all of the SVT’s 
changes are designed to 
aid the Raptor’s oﬀ-road 
ability, they don’t exaF a 
toll in truck utility. Xe 
Raptor is rated to tow 
6000 pounds and carry a 
maximum payload of 
1020 pounds. A truck 
that works as hard as it 
plays? Sign us up.
Off-Road 
Ability
Ford’s Special Vehicle Team—the same engineers who devel-
oped the Mustang Shelby GT500—transformed the F-150 
pickup into the most capable high-speed 4WD truck ever 
produced. The Raptor team tuned the suspension on a brutal 
62-mile loop in a remote part of the California desert.

Re 1.5-liter engine has 
been replaced with a

sion (CVT) as before, but 
with a new twiﬆ. Re 
main eleQric motor drive 
was downsized and 
produces less torque (153 
lb-a versus 295). But a 
reduQion gearset that 
conneQs it to the gearbox 
allows that motor to spin 
faﬆer. Consequently, it 
makes 80 peak hp, 13 
more than before. Re

battery pack has a more 
eﬀeQive cooling syﬆem 
too, which allows peak 
output to rise from 25 
kilowatts to 27. And now, 
ﬁnally, Prius owners can 
hit an EV button and 
cruise for about a mile 
locked in eleQric drive. On

in this Hyundai’s price 
range are usually hot-rod

drive econoboxes.

alluring driver’s car. Re 
result is a sports coupe 
that can fend oﬀ cars 
coﬆing thousands more. 
In faI, when we teﬆed a

nearly matched the Inﬁniti 
in every performance 
measure, and did so for 
$15,000 less. Re chassis

right up to the edge of

package, which includes 
19-inch wheels with

Hyundai’s big V8 is not 
available—but the 306-hp 
V6 and the six-speed 
automatic is good for 
sub-six-second sprints to 
60 mph. A 210-hp turbo 
four-cylinder is a less 
expensive and rather 
compelling alternative. 
Re Genesis Coupe is

Hyundai has transformed its image—and its cars—in an amazingly short time.

car design, especially a 
sporty one, depends on 
its ability not juﬆ to turn 
heads, but to inspire an 
almoﬆ primal luﬆ in 
everyone from a college 
kid to his grandfather—
hitting all the age groups 
in between. Re new 
Camaro does juﬆ 
that—and it’s become 
one of the few cars 
outside the supercar 
ranks that will almoﬆ 
always elicit a conversa-
tion at the gas pumps. 
Under the watch of GM 
design boss Ed Welburn, 
Chevy imagined the new 
Camaro as a thoroughly 
modern take on the 1967 
original. And it looks 
amazingly close to the 
2006 concept car. GM 
engineers somehow 
avoided the compromises 
that tend to dilute a 
designer’s original vision 
as it makes its way into 
produXion. Re inset 
front grille and the 
outboard round head-
lights oﬀer a real link to 
that ﬁrﬆ Camaro, yet the 
big wheels and taut 
proportions perfeXly 
convey 21ﬆ-century 
muscle. Good design 
extends to the interior 
too: Re view through the 
windshield is 1960s cool, 
yet it’s the subtleties that 
make this car feel so 
right. Of course, a Camaro 
wouldn’t feel right at all if 
there wasn’t some 
serious ﬁrepower under 
the hood. Re top-dog  
SS models have a big 
422-hp 6.2-liter V8, and 
even the base cars 
receive a potent V6 that 
returns 30 mpg highway. 
Re real triumph is that all 
the Camaro’s perfor-
mance and intelligent 
design can be had for juﬆ

“crossover” became 
synonymous with rugged, 
car-based utility wagons, 
Subaru had the Outback. 
To many, that original 
1995 Outback was the 
ﬁrﬆ real crossover, 
blending the beﬆ 
attributes of an SUV with 
the nimble handling of a 
traditional car and the 
capability of Subaru’s 
rally-bred all-wheel-drive 
expertise. Wis lateﬆ 
model only widens that 
capability envelope. 
Riding on beefy tires, and 
with a suspension tall 
enough to produce a 
Hummer-humbling  
8.7 inches of ground clear-
ance, the Outback is not  
a corner carver. Inﬆead, 
the Outback is a 
sweet-natured wagon 
with poised road manners 
that scrambles eﬀort-
lessly along dirt roads and 
up some pretty diﬃcult 
trails. With the wheelbase 
ﬆretched over the 
previous version’s, 
rear-seat comfort is 
subﬆantially improved. 
Fold that seat down, and 
the Outback can swallow 
71.3 cubic feet of 
camping gear, gardening 
supplies or pinewood 
planks. Subaru owners 
are determined to wring 
every laﬆ ounce  
of value from their 
purchases—there’s plenty 
of value and versatility in 
this new Outback.

its personality. But for  
the Kia Soul, the name ﬁts. 
Sure, it’s one of the leaﬆ 
expensive new cars on the 
market, but it packs quite a 
lot of subﬆance into that 
bargain-basement price tag. 
Inside, the materials used 
are one solid notch above 
the class. Kia oﬀers two 
engines. We prefer the more 
potent 142-hp 2.0-liter inline 
Four that comes ﬆandard 
on Sport models. We Soul 
Sport is surprisingly fun to 
drive. We ﬁrm suspension 
and robuﬆ motor make 
short work of switchbacks. 
And yet, on a recent 
300-mile fuel-economy 
marathon teﬆ drive, the Kia 
Soul Sport returned a very 
solid 31.2 mpg. When three 
teﬆers piled into the back 
seat they found plenty of 
comfort—even on longer 
trips. And with those  
seats folded, the Kia can 
handle 53.4 cubic feet of 
cargo. When you back  
up the head-turning  
ﬆyling with grin-inducing 
performance and a  
modeﬆ price, you’ve got 
one very smart buy.

biological intelligence will match the 
range and subtlety of human intelli-
gence. It will then soar past it.” 
Even before we reach that point, 
Kurzweil and his peers foresee breath-
taking advances. Scientists in Israel 
have developed tiny robots to crawl 
through blood vessels attacking can-
cers, and labs in the United States are 
working on similar technology. These 
robots will grow smaller and more 
capable. One day, intelligent nanoro-
bots may be integrated into our bodies 
to clear arteries and rebuild failing 
organs, communicating with each 
other and the outside world via a 
“cloud” network. Tiny bots might 
attach themselves to neurons in the 
brain and add their processing 
power—and that of other computers 
in the cloud—to ours, giving us men-
tal resources that would dwarf any-
thing available now. By stimulating 
the optic, auditory or tactile nerves, 
such nanobots might be able to simu-
late vision, hearing or touch, provid-
ing “augmented reality” overlays iden-
tifying street names, helping with face 
recognition or telling us how to repair 
things we’ve never seen before. 
Scientists in Japan are already pro-
ducing 
rudimentary 
nanobot 
“brains.” Could it take decades for 
these technologies to come to frui-
tion? Yes—but only decades, not cen-
turies. The result may be what Kurz-
weil calls “an intimate merger 
between the technology- creating spe-
cies and the technological evolution-
ary process it spawned.” 
If scientists can integrate tiny 
robots into the human body, then they 
or some time now, futurists have 
been talking about a concept called 
the Singularity, a technological jump 
so big that society will be transformed. 
If they’re right, the Industrial Revolu-
tion—or even the development of agri-
culture or harnessing of ﬁre—might 
seem like minor historical hiccups by 
comparison. The possibility is now 
seeming realistic enough that scien-
tists and engineers are grappling with 
the implications—for good and ill.
When I spoke to technology pio-
neer and futurist Ray Kurzweil (who 
popularized the idea in his book  
The Singularity Is Near), he put it this 
way: “Within a quarter-century, non-

(nearly) immortal, in which robots 
can make almost any object from 
cheap raw materials (basically, dirt) 
and in which ordinary people are 
smarter than Einstein thanks to brain 
implants—but still nowhere near as 
smart as fully artiﬁcial intelligences. 
That’s a world that’s hard to imagine. 
And what we do imagine can sound 
either good or bad. On the upside, 
what’s not to like about being super-
smart and healthy, with access to most 
products essentially for free? On the 
downside, could always-on links from 
our brains to the computing cloud 
lead to Star Trek’s über-totalitarian 
Borg collective or something equally 
scary? And, what happens to those 
computer-brain interfaces and nano-
bots when they’re taken over by the 
descendants of the Conﬁcker worm? 
Now there’s an argument for strong 
antivirus software. 
Dramatically enhancing human 
capabilities for good, alas, also means 
enhancing human capabilities for 
evil. That’s something famed com-
puter science professor and writer 
Vernor Vinge warns about: technol-
ogy that could, as he wrote in his  
novel Rainbows End, “put world-killer 
weapons into the hands of anyone 
having a bad-hair day.” Then there’s 
the mind-control problem. Nano-
robots ﬂoating around in your blood-
stream could keep your coronary 
arteries from clogging, but they also 
could release drugs on command, 
making you, say, literally love Big 
Brother. Knowing what we know 
about human history, do such abuses 
seem terribly unlikely? 
Of course, the problem may never 
come up. Vinge, who originated the 
Singularity idea, has written about 
why it may never arrive—though he’s 
can build tiny robots into, well, every-
thing, ushering in an era of “smart 
matter.” Nanobots may be able to 
build products molecule-by- molecule, 
making the material world look a lot 
like the computer world—with just 
about everything becoming smart, 
cheap and networked to pretty much 
everything else, including your brain.
It’s almost impossibly futuristic-
sounding stuff. But even that scenario 
is just the precursor to the Singularity 
itself, the moment when, in Kurzweil’s 
words, “nonbiological intelligence 
will have access to its own design and 
will be able to improve itself in an 
increasingly rapid redesign cycle.” 
Imagine computers so advanced that 
they can design and build new, even 
better computers, with subsequent 
generations emerging so quickly they 
soon leave human engineers the 
equivalent of centuries behind. That’s 
the Singularity—and given the expo-
nential acceleration of technological 
change, it could come by midcentury. 
But Is It for Real?
It seems like a tall order, but lots of 
people think that such predictions are 
likely to come true. I asked science-
ﬁction writer John Scalzi about Singu-
larity issues and he pointed out that 
the Skype video we were using to chat 
would have seemed like witchcraft a 
few centuries earlier. Profound tech-
nological changes once took millen-
nia, then centuries, and then decades. 
Now they occur every few years. The 
iPhone and pocket-size 12-megapixel 
digital cameras would have seemed 
amazing a decade ago. Web browsers 
are only about 15 years old. People 
(including my wife) have computers 
implanted in their bodies already, in 
the form of deﬁbrillators, pacemakers 
and other devices.
Still, I’m describing a world in 
which nanotechnology makes us 
NANOROBOTS FLOATING AROUND IN YOUR 
BLOODSTREAM COULD KEEP YOUR 
CORONARY ARTERIES FROM CLOGGING, 
BUT THEY ALSO COULD RELEASE DRUGS ON 
COMMAND, MAKING YOU, SAY, LITERALLY 
LOVE BIG BROTHER. 
betting the other way. So what can we 
do now to affect how things turn out? 
Some people are trying. The Foresight 
Institute has published guidelines for 
developing nanotechnology, such as 
a ban on self- replicating nanobots 
that function independently (poten-
tially turning the whole world into 
more nanobots, something known in 
the trade as the gray-goo problem) 
and sharp limitations on weapons-
related nanotech research. Research-
ers in artiﬁcial intelligence are work-
ing on guidelines for producing 
“friendly AI” that would be well- 
disposed toward humans as part of 
their programming, thus foreclosing 
any pesky robotic world- domination 
ambitions. NASA, Google and others 
have even started something called 
the Singularity University to study 
ways to avoid problems while still 
reaping the beneﬁts. Some have sug-
gested that we ought to go slow on the 
so-called GRAIN technologies (Genet-
ics, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence 
and Nanotechnology). Sun Microsys-
tems’ Bill Joy has even called for 
“relinquishing” some technologies 
he sees as dangerous. 
But I wonder if that’s such a good 
idea. Destructive technologies gener-
ally seem to come along sooner than 
constructive ones—we got war rockets 
before missile interceptors, and bio-
logical warfare before antibiotics. This 
suggests that there will be a window of 
vulnerability between the time when 
we develop technologies that can do 
dangerous things, and the time when 
we can protect against those dangers. 
The slower we move, the longer that 
window may remain open, leaving 
more time for the evil, the unscrupu-
lous or the careless to wreak havoc. My 
conclusion? Faster, please.

SEVEN MILES ABOVE THE EMPTY EXPANSE OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN,
on May 31, 2009, an Air France A330 passenger jet cut through the midnight darkness. The plane 
had taken off 3 hours earlier, climbing from Rio de Janeiro on a northeast heading, its navigation 
computers hewing to a great-circle route that would take the ﬂight 5680 miles to Paris. 
At 10:35 pm local time, one of the co-pilots on the ﬂight deck radioed Atlantico Area Con-
trol Center in Recife, Brazil, and announced that the plane had just reached a navigation way-
point called INTOL, situated 350 miles off the Brazilian coast. The waypoint lay just shy of the 
Intertropical Convergence Zone, a meteorological region along the equator famous for intense

 thunderstorms. Staff at Atlantico acknowledged the trans-
mission and received the airplane’s reply: “Air France Four 
Four Seven, thank you.”
It was the second time within the past 12 hours that the jet, 
F-GZCP, had crossed this stretch of ocean, having ﬂown the 
Paris-to-Rio leg with only 2 hours to refuel and load passengers 
before departing again. Such was the lot of the four-year-old 
long-haul plane: a repeated cycle of ﬂight and turnaround, as 
rhythmic and uneventful as the phases of the moon. But the 
routine was about to be broken.
After receiving AF 447’s transmission, Atlantico asked for 
the estimated time it would take the aircraft to reach the TASIL 
waypoint, which lies on the boundary of the Atlantico and the 
Dakar Oceanic control areas. At that point communication 
would pass from Brazil to Senegal. AF 447 did not reply. The 
controller asked again. Still, there was no reply. The controller 
asked a third and fourth time, then alerted other control cen-
ters about the lapse. 
According to the ﬂight plan ﬁled by AF 447, the plane should 
have crossed into Dakar Oceanic at 11:20 pm, at which point 
the ﬂight crew would have made radio contact with Dakar to 
conﬁrm their position. They didn’t. They also failed to contact 
the Cape Verde controller, whose airspace they were supposed 
to enter at 12:43 am. As time went on, controllers along the air-
craft’s route began to worry that the problem was more than 
just a communications breakdown.
By 3:47 am, the ﬂight should have appeared on the radar 
screens of Portuguese air trafﬁc controllers. It didn’t. An hour 
later, Air France contacted the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses 
D E C E M B E R  2 0 0 9
pour la Sécurité de l’Aviation Civile 
(BEA), the French equivalent of the 
United States’ National Transportation 
Safety Board. By 8 am, French authori-
ties ofﬁcially reached what had become 
a grim, unavoidable conclusion: Air 
France 447 had disappeared.
VANISHING WITHOUT A TRACE 
is not supposed to happen in this day 
and age. The globe is crisscrossed by 
constant ship and air trafﬁc. A constella-
tion of satellites orbits overhead, and 
communication is nonstop. Yet, for a 
few days in early June, it seemed that the 
impossible had happened. Air France 
447 and the 228 people onboard were 
simply gone. There was no distress call 
or wreckage; there were no bodies. 
Within hours, the French govern-
ment deployed a search-and-rescue  
airplane near the TASIL waypoint. Over 
the next few days a flotilla of ships  
and aircraft arrived to assist the search 
operation, including a French nuclear  
submarine and a research vessel with  
an unmanned deep-water submersible 
that were dispatched to  
ﬁnd the ﬂight data recorder, 
or black box. 
Yet for days nothing was 
found. The only clues to  
the plane’s fate were auto-
matic messages that the 
onboard maintenance com-
puter transmitted by a 
datalink system called the 
Aircraft Communications 
Addressing and Reporting 
System (ACARS). The sys-
tem transmits text mes-
sages via satellite to ground 
stations, which then for-
ward them on land lines to 
the intended destination. In 
just a 4-minute span, the 
system had broadcast 24 
reports to Air France’s dis-
patch center in Paris, each

1. Broadcast Tower
Re FAA’s Airport Surface DeteFion Equipment-X 
integrates data from an inbound plane’s GPS  
unit and the transponder signals from ground 
vehicles and other planes in the air to generate a 
continuously updated map of all airport traﬃc. 
Remote towers capture and relay information 
from airplanes in ﬂight. ASDE-X, which alerts air 
traﬃc controllers to an impending conﬂiF, is 
already in use at 20 U.S. airports; the FAA plans 
to inﬆall it in 15 more by 2011.
3. High-Frequency Radar 
DeteFors use sensitive radar with 
wavelengths as tight as a 
millimeter to spot debris as small 
as a bolt that could cause crashes; 
some syﬆems have cameras that 
compare images to a database of 
common objeFs, diﬆinguishing  
grass or paper from more 
dangerous obﬆacles.  
4. Runway Status Lights
Modern versions of runway 
lights—which guide pilots, 
particularly at night or in bad 
weather—aF like traﬃc lights: 
Red means a runway is in use; 
green means a runway is clear for 
takeoﬀ, landing or crossing. 
2. Cockpit Digital Maps
Paper maps keep pilots out of 
trouble, but they need to be 
updated regularly. Digital maps 
of airports and the surrounding 
areas are more easily amended 
to include new obﬆacles and 
infraﬆruFure. Pilots carry 
laptop-size computers called 
EleFronic Flight Bags that plug 
into the cockpit navigation 
syﬆem. New EFBs alert users to 
update maps using Wi-Fi.

AT 2:42 PM ON JULY 25, 2000, Air France 4590 roared down 
runway 26R at Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, 
bound for New York with 109 passengers and crew onboard. As 
the supersonic jet accelerated for takeoﬀ, it ran over a 17-inch-long 
strip of titanium that had fallen oﬀ the thrust reverser of a recently 
departed DC-10. Re metal shredded one of the Concorde’s tires, 
and the ﬂying pieces ruptured and ignited a fuel tank. Re plane 
crashed 2 minutes later, killing all onboard and four people on the 
ground. Investigators found the runway was unchecked for  
12 hours before the crash. Re accident highlighted a paradox: 
Some of the worst threats to aviation, including debris, vehicles 
and other aircrag, are located on the ground.

NORTHWEST 255 had just taken oﬀ from Detroit on Aug. 16, 1987, when it began 
rocking side to side. Re plane clipped a building and caught ﬁre before sliding under a 
railroad embankment and two highway overpasses (right). Re crash, which killed all 154 
onboard and two bystanders, occurred because the MD-82’s pilots did not extend slats 
on the leading edge and ﬂaps on the trailing edge of the wings to generate extra liU. Re 
manufacturer recommended that airlines modify their MD-80 cockpit checklists; U.S. 
carriers did so, but not all foreign carriers. In 2008 a Spanair MD-82 crashed in Madrid 
because of a similar mistake, killing 154—showing that failure to modify procedures in 
response to crashes, close calls and government advisories can cost lives. Here are 
other changes in the cockpit that reduce chance of pilot error.  — MARK HUBER

1. Make Two-Person 
Altitude Calls 
To prevent planes from 
dropping below assigned 
altitudes—which increases the 
risk of midair collisions—the 
co-pilot sets the altitude, called 
“pointing,” and the pilot 
conﬁrms that it is corre`.
2. Retract Speed Brakes
Failing to retra` speed 
brakes—panels that increase 
wing-surface area—in an 
aborted landing means an 
aircraU can’t climb quickly. Many 
airlines require co-pilots to 
verify speed-brake ﬆatus if the 
plane misses a landing.
3. Know Speed Limits 
Flaps, which are extended to 
allow airplanes to remain aloU 
at slower speeds during takeoﬀ 
and landing, can suﬀer motor 
damage if they are deployed 
while the airplane is traveling 
too faﬆ. In addition to memoriz-
ing these speed limits, co-pilots 
at some airlines are required to 
call them out as the airplane 
prepares to land. 
4. Conﬁrm Spoiler 
Deployment 
Like speed brakes, spoilers are 
wing surfaces that diminish liU 
and are needed during landing, 
when an airplane muﬆ quickly 
shed speed. It is the co-pilot’s 
job to conﬁrm that spoilers 
have been deployed during a 
landing to prevent the plane 
from overshooting the runway.

cause, they often help create recommendations that prevent 
the problem from recurring. 
The FAA is determined to cut the already minuscule airliner 
fatality rate in half by 2025. With this in mind, the agency 
recently developed a new approach to make safety improve-
ments. In 2007, it began working with airlines to sift through 
the masses of data that planes record about their normal ﬂight 
operations, looking for safety improvements that could pre-
empt accidents before they happen, instead of learning these 
lessons after a plane crash occurs. 
The sophistication of aircraft makes this strategy possible. 
Modern planes are studded with environmental sensors that 
record ﬂight conditions, while other sensors constantly assess 
the health of the airplane’s subsystems. This information is fed 
to a central computer, forming a network that resembles the 
neural system of a primitive organism. At the end of each ﬂight, 
maintenance crews can easily download the data for analysis. 
Airlines have been using this information to improve their 
safety performance since the early ’90s, but two years ago the 
FAA began collecting these records as part of its Aviation Safety 
Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system.
This year, the FAA opened the Accident Investigation and 
Prevention Service to scrutinize the ASIAS data. “We’re having 
many fewer accidents, but the ones we do have are being 
caused by threats that are much harder to detect,” says Jay 
Pardee, the director of the new ofﬁce. As an example of the kind 
of problem that ASIAS data could prevent, consider Comair 
Flight 5191, which was scheduled to take off from Lexington, 
Ky., in August 2006. Thinking they were on 7000-foot Runway 
22, the pilots failed to get their aircraft airborne before they ran 
out of asphalt on the runway they were actually on—3500-foot 
Runway 26. The airplane’s wheels clipped an airport perimeter 
fence and the plane plowed into a grove of trees 1800 feet from 
the end of the runway. All 47 passengers and two of three crew 
members were killed. After the accident, the FAA reviewed 25 
years of data and discovered that 80 commercial aircraft 
around the country had either taken off or tried to take off from 
incorrect runways. “Nobody connected the dots,” Pardee says. 
Following the AF 447 disappearance, other Airbus 330 
operators studied their internal ﬂight records to seek patterns. 
Delta, analyzing the data of Northwest Airlines ﬂights that 
occurred before the two companies merged, found a dozen 
incidents in which at least one of an A330’s airspeed 
indicators— 4-inch-long, pressure-sensing pitot tubes located 
on the fuselage under the cockpit—had brieﬂy stopped work-
ing. Each time, the flights had been traveling through the 
Intertropical Convergence Zone, the same location where Air 
France 447 disappeared. 
In the case of the Northwest A330s, the pitot tube malfunc-
tions had been brief and harmless. But what if a severe version 
of the problem had struck Air France 447 amid more unforgiv-
ing circumstances?
subsystems onboard the aircraft. 
At 11:10 pm, about 35 minutes after 
AF 447’s last verbal communication, 
the system sent a message that the auto-
pilot had disconnected. Seconds later, 
it reported that the ﬂight control system 
was unable to determine the aircraft’s 
correct speed. Subsequent messages 
cited a cascade of other malfunctions. 
At 11:14 pm, the ﬁnal message reported 
that the airliner’s cabin either had 
depressurized, was moving with high 
vertical velocity, or both.
ACARS messages are transmitted in 
a dense alphanumeric code and are 
used for airplane maintenance, not real-
time monitoring of ﬂights by dispatch 
centers. When investigators realized 
that the plane was lost, they scrutinized 
the messages. The story the transmis-
sions told was tantalizing, but inconclu-
sive. Did the error messages suggest a 
fault in the sensors, or was the flight 
management system somehow fatally 
corrupted—perhaps because of a midair 
lightning strike?
The absence of clues causes con-
cerns that reach beyond the AF 447 
investigation. Was the crash a result of 
pilot error, an unexpected breakdown of 
vital equipment or a combination of 
both? Without answers, there is no way 
to guarantee that another airliner won’t 
suffer the same fate. 
ALL THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO A 
crash like Air France 447’s can obscure 
an important truth: Commercial air 
travel is incredibly safe—and getting 
safer. In 2008, the U.S. fatality rate was 
fewer than one death per nearly 11 mil-
lion passenger trips. This impressive 
record is the result of more than a cen-
tury of incremental improvements that 
have been amassed through painstak-
ing forensic analysis. 
After each plane crash, investigators 
study the wreckage, analyze ﬂight data 
and examine clues regarding ﬂight con-
ditions. Once they have determined a

AT LAST, ON JUNE 6, THE MULTINATIONAL SEARCH 
effort began to ﬁnd evidence of the crash. The Brazilian mili-
tary recovered bodies and debris floating approximately  
40 miles north of the last automatic Aircraft Communications 
transmission. Over the next two weeks, search vessels retrieved 
51 corpses from a stretch of ocean 150 miles wide, along with 
bits of wreckage—a section of the radome, a toilet compart-
ment, part of a galley—that collectively added up to less than  
5 percent of the aircraft. The largest single piece was the tail 
ﬁn, marked with the distinctive blue and red stripes of the 
French national carrier. 
The most important piece of the wreckage, however, 
remained missing. More than a month after the plane went 
down, despite the joint efforts of the French and U.S. navies, 
the black box still hadn’t been found. Given the huge search 
area, the ruggedness of the undersea terrain and the depth of 
the water (up to 15,000 feet), locating the recorder, let alone 
retrieving it, was proving to be an enormous task. Once the 
unit’s acoustic pinger passed its 30-day certiﬁed life span, the 
chances of recovering the black box became virtually nil. 
Without the box’s data, the only physical evidence of the 
airplane available to investigators was the mangled wreckage. 
From the way it had been deformed—in particular, the way the 
ﬂoor of the crew’s rest compartment had buckled upward—
French investigators determined that the fuselage hit the water 
more or less intact, belly ﬁrst, at a high rate of vertical speed. 
Added to the ACARS messages and the satellite weather data, 
the evidence began to conform to a possible scenario.
By 10:45 pm, 10 minutes after the last radio transmission, 
the plane hit the ﬁrst, small storm cell in the Intertropical Con-
vergence Zone. Fifteen minutes later, it hit a larger, fast- 
growing system. And then, just before its last ACARS transmis-
sions, the plane hit a whopper, a multicell storm whose roiling 
thermal energy rose more than 3 miles higher than AF 447’s 
altitude. Buffeted by turbulence, near the heart of a strong 
thunderstorm, the pitot tubes froze over. Lacking reliable 
speed indicators, the airplane’s computerized Flight Manage-
ment System automatically disengaged the autopilot, forcing 
the co-pilots to ﬂy the airplane manually. 
Without autopilot, the pilots had no envelope protection 
restrictions, which are designed to keep the pilot from making 
control inputs that could overstress the aircraft. This is par-
ticularly dangerous for airliners at high altitudes. The thin air 
demands that airplanes ﬂy faster to achieve lift, but they still 
must remain below speed limits. Flying too fast can create a 
phenomenon known as mach tuck, when supersonic shock 
waves along the wings shift the aircraft’s center of pressure aft 
and can make it pitch into an uncon-
trollable nose-dive. Flying too slow can 
cause a plane to stall.
AF 447’s ﬂight crew, disoriented in 
the storm, uncertain about their speed 
and buffeted by turbulence, could eas-
ily have taken the A330 outside its ﬂight 
envelope. “The fact that they didn’t 
transmit a mayday would seem to indi-
cate that whatever happened to them 
happened quickly,” says William Wal-
dock, a professor of safety science  
at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univer-
sity in Arizona. 
WITHOUT MORE DATA, THIS KIND 
of scenario can never be veriﬁed com-
pletely. But the global aviation commu-
nity has already taken steps to prevent 
another accident like AF 447. Within 
days, Air France replaced pitot tubes on 
its Airbus planes with ones made by 
another company, and in July Airbus

never identify those links. And that means safety ofﬁcials might 
never learn the full lessons of the disaster. To prevent a similar 
loss of forensic evidence, executives at Airbus say they are now 
studying alternatives to physical black boxes. It is feasible to 
create a system that could broadcast not only text messages 
like ACARS but comprehensive data about the status of every 
aircraft, in real time. The aircraft would continuously transmit 
data to VHF stations within a radius of 125 miles, or by satellite 
if the plane is farther away. 
Airliners in ﬂight could one day stream all sorts of high-
speed data, sharing information directly with one another. “It 
would be a network in the sky,” says Bob Smith, chief technol-
ogy ofﬁcer at Honeywell, which manufactured AF 447’s ACARS. 
“Aircraft could pass not only information about their location 
and where they’re headed,” he says, “but whole data sets. An 
airliner over Seattle could send its weather radar picture to a 
plane inbound from Dallas. And the guy from Dallas could pass 
it along to ﬁve other aircraft.” Military aircraft already use a 
similar system; it is not clear if civil aviation will adopt it. 
The disquieting truth is that we don’t really know precisely 
what happened to Air France 447, and perhaps never will. The 
same links in the accident chain could someday take down 
another unlucky airliner. If they do, improved technology 
might provide investigators with the data they need to make 
sure that the next time is the last time.
FC
advised other airlines to do the same. 
Three months later the FAA turned the 
recommendation into a regulation.
To be sure, the pitot tubes are not the 
deﬁnitive cause of the crash. Even if they 
had failed, that alone should not have 
been enough to bring down an airliner. 
As in virtually every fatal air crash, what 
doomed AF 447 was not a single mal-
function or error of judgment, but rather 
a sequence of missteps that crash inves-
tigators call the accident chain. “There’s 
always a series of events,” the FAA’s 
Pardee says. “That means there are mul-
tiple opportunities to intervene and 
break that accident chain.” 
In the case of AF 447, the error chain 
included the co-pilots’ decision to ﬂy too 
close to severe thunderstorms—bad 
weather that several other pilots, ﬂying 
similar routes that night, had chosen to 
give a wide berth. There were certainly 
other links in the accident chain that 
pushed AF 447 beyond its limits. But 
unless the black box is found, we may 
PASSENGERS USUALLY FEEL RELIEF when their plane touches 
down. But those peering out the windows of Colgan 3268 this 
May were horriﬁed to see a wheel rolling away from their airplane 
during an otherwise routine landing. Re end of an axle in a wheel 
bearing snapped as the Q400 Bombardier screeched across the 
runway—and as a passenger shot a cellphone video (leF) of the 
chilling event. Re airplane safely landed on its remaining tires. 
Investigators found that the wheel bearing failed aFer it overheat-
ed during the landing. Wheel bearings are just a few of thousands 
of parts that endure the stress of repeated takeoﬀs, ﬂights and 
landings. Maintainers and designers constantly adopt new 
materials and inspection devices to prevent heavily stressed parts 
of planes from failing during ﬂights. 
1. Wheel Bearings 
Wheel bearings support the 
entire weight of the aircraft  
on a surface area of a few 
square inches, and during a 
landing they accelerate from  
0 to 2000 rpm in less than  
1 second. Ball bearings made 
from new ceramic formulas can 
better resist the temperature 
changes and physical stresses 
of these conditions. 
2. Wing Spars
Stress on the wing is borne by 
the spars. Boeing’s 787 
Dreamliner is the ﬁrﬆ civilian 
airplane to use carbon compos-
ites to form spars, but designers 
added extra metal faﬆeners to 
ﬆiﬀen the wings aFer teﬆs 
showed they couldn’t handle the 
FAA’s maximum aerodynamic 
load limits. As with other 
composite parts, crews use 
ultrasound to seek early signs of 
this ﬆress. Engineers under-

materials like carbon compos-
ites pose unique safety issues. 
Maintenance workers use

invasive scanners to ﬁnd 
deformations and fracures 
inside composite materials. 
peak in areas where the wing 
connecs to the fuselage. Wing 
skin is inﬆalled in panels held 
together with faﬆeners. Every 
hole or deformation that 
interrupts the skin makes it 
more susceptible to cracking, 
so maintenance crews inspec 
areas around the faﬆeners with 
ultrasound equipment for signs 
of weakness. Researchers at 
Sandia National Laboratories 
are designing paper-thin 
pressure sensors that 
continually monitor for cracks.
4. Fuselage Skin
Aluminum fuselages are built 
to handle changes caused by 
cabin pressurization—which 
inﬂates and deﬂates the body 
of an airliner as much as a 
quarter of an inch—but tension

entire fuselage. Windows, 
doors and rivet holes magnify 
failure. Resin-ﬁlled nano- 
ﬆrucures embedded in the 
material could patch cracks as 
soon as they form.

C. Central Processing Unit
Re moﬆ common netbook conﬁgurations currently 
involve 1.3- and 1.6-GHz versions of Intel’s power- 
eﬃcient Atom processor. Ris is plenty of power for 
the simple applications netbooks are designed for, but 
future models will see faﬆer speeds. And competitors 
such as Nvidia now oﬀer netbook-targeted chipsets 
that aim to oﬀer superior graphical performance. Moﬆ 
users should avoid anything slower than 1 GHz.
Most of the major wireless carriers now sell dirt-cheap subsidized 
netbooks (they typically go for about $200, though we’ve seen them 
sell for basically nothing during promotions). The catch: The 
machines come with long-term contracts for expensive mobile data 
plans—typically $40 to $60 per month, on top of your other phone and 
Internet bills. Meaning that an almost-free netbook can suddenly cost 
an extra $1400 over a two-year contract. Our advice: If you want 
take-anywhere 3G network access, stick to a separate 3G modem. The 
monthly fees will be the same, and it won’t be tied to one computer. 
The netbook formula is simple: Take one ordinary notebook, strip out some of  
its processing power, shrink its size by a little and reduce the price tag by a lot. And 
while early models lacked the ability to handle anything much more demanding  
than a Web page or a text document, new netbooks cram performance once  
reserved for full-size laptops into 2-pound packages costing around $250 to $500. 
These machines aren’t designed to serve as your primary PC, but they are ideal as 
low-cost, low-mass secondary systems for carrying on a plane or around the house.

B. Keyboard 
Although some newer models cram in full-size key-
boards, the small size of moﬆ netbooks necessitates a 
shrunken typing space—usually 10 to 20 percent 
smaller—which can cause discomfort for people used 
to larger layouts. Be sure to test out any keyboard 
before you buy to make sure you ﬁnd it comfortable.

Microso[’s 8-year-old Windows XP has found a second wind powering low-coﬆ net-

Windows Viﬆa if you can—the bloated OS can overwhelm netbooks’ low-power pro-
cessors. Open-source devotees may also opt for a Linux netbook, although these are 
becoming less common. And sorry, Apple fans: no Mac netbooks juﬆ yet.

I. USB 
Netbooks usually have fewer USB ports than full-size 
notebooks—typically one to three. One useful feature 
to look out for: Some models allow users to charge 
other gadgets through a USB port, even while the net-
book is in sleep mode—so you can charge a phone or 
MP3 player while the computer is ﬆashed in a bag.
H. RAM
The more random-access memory (RAM) a netbook 
has, the better it will be able to handle heavy-duty 
applications. Top-shelf netbooks currently come with 
up to 2 GB of DDR2 SDRAM, but 1 GB is enough for 
moﬆ applications (it’s also the minimum amount of 
RAM required to run Windows 7).
J. Storage 
If you plan on storing a 
large library of media, 
opt for the largest hard 
drive you can afford—
current netbook models 
have 250 GB or more of 
storage. But if you just 
want a netbook for surf-
ing the Web and writing 
documents, solid-state 
drives , which hold less 
data but are more dura-
ble and potentially faﬆer , 
may be preferable.  FC

grated 3G network con-

appealing proposition 
considering the devices’ 
take-anywhere size. 
Expect to pay an addi-
tional $40 to $60 per

   Reader 
Moﬆ netbooks favor SD 
memory-card slots over 
space-consuming optical 
drives (which are usually 
offered as an add-on 
external accessory). 
aese slots make it easy 
to upload juﬆ-shot digital 
photos. Larger 16 and 
32 GB SD cards allow for 
expandable memory. 
G. Battery 
Netbooks have smaller 
screens and less power-
ful processors than full-
size laptops—and bat-
tery life beneﬁts. Some 
models claim 12 hours 
per charge, but anything 
more than four is excel-
lent. To ﬆay slim, many 
netbooks use batteries 
that protrude from the

 e Super Falcon submersible uses its inverted wings to move 
through water like a plane through air.
Ten in the morning is a late start for the Super 
Falcon. For the past two days I’ve strolled down 
to the pier at dawn, just as the fog begins to roll 
off Monterey Bay, to watch as crewmen peel back 
a collapsible garage to reveal the winged sub-
mersible and prepare it for the water. But the 
Super Falcon’s rigorous workout has finally 
caught up with it. On their ﬁrst dive, Graham 
Hawkes, the sub’s designer, and pilot trainee Lee 
Behel inadvertently tested its ability to navigate 
kelp beds. The vessel had to be cut free of the 
stalks by a safety diver. Then, they pushed its lim-
its with “upset” maneuvers—near vertical dives 
and 90-degree rolls—that resulted in a busted 
prop and broken rudder. “The whole idea was to 
ﬁnd any weak points, and we did,” Hawkes said 
as he replaced plastic rudder ﬁttings with stron-
ger metal components. “This was a good thing.”
Still, it meant that Hawkes had to drive 250 
miles round-trip from Monterey, Calif., to his

cisco to get new prop blades—an 
errand that took until 3 am. But 
because today’s my day to get 
behind the controls, I’m all for 
getting the submersible in top 
working order.
Like Behel, I’m here at the 
Coast Guard pier in Monterey for 
ﬂight school—a training course 
for prospective Super Falcon 
pilots. Behel has a bit more ﬂight 
experience than me, however: 
He used to ﬂy F-4 Phantom jet 
ﬁghters for the military. It’s not 
surprising that he was drawn to 
the Super Falcon, since the two 
craft share many of the same 
design principles. Long and 
thin, with a tapered nose, the 
Super Falcon has rear horizontal 
stabilizers, two large tail rudders 
and dual acrylic cockpit cano-
pies. It also has inverted wings, 
which turn the aeronautic con-
cept of lift upside down, allowing the sub to literally 
ﬂy through the water. Whereas conventional subs 
rely on ballast, the Super Falcon descends as for-
ward speed creates a pressure differential between 
the top and bottom of the wings. Free of ballast, the 
sub is positively buoyant, which dramatically 
increases safety. Lose power and the vessel auto-
matically ﬂoats to the surface. 
Once the Super Falcon has been repaired, the 
crew hitches a custom-built trailer to the back of a 
Toyota Land Cruiser and I climb into the sub’s rear 
cockpit. Hawkes goes over the controls and life-
support systems with me, then climbs into the front. 
As the acrylic canopies descend over our heads, the 
world outside goes eerily silent. All I hear is the 
intercom chatter between Hawkes and dive supervi-
sor Dirk Rosen. Then, a slight jolt. The SUV shifts 
into reverse and slowly backs us into the water.

Graham Hawkes is to ocean exploration what Burt 
Rutan is to private space travel—a relentless inno-
vator who challenges the accepted wisdom in his 
ﬁeld by inventing around it. He began his career 
in the 1960s as a civilian ocean engineer, working 
on underwater vehicles for the British Special 
Forces. For the next two decades, he designed sub-
mersibles for the oil industry and for scientiﬁc 
research. Some of those vessels found their way 
into movies. Hawkes piloted one, the Mantis, in 
the 1981 ﬁlm For Your Eyes Only—right into the

tence). Two of his bubble-hulled Deep Rover subs 
were used by  James Cameron for his Aliens of the 
Deep documentary. 
But after launching the ﬁrst Deep Rover, Hawkes 
had a nagging feeling. “I remember sitting on a rock 
in Halifax Harbor thinking, we can do better than 
this,” he says. While aviation advanced swiftly and 
consistently over the past century—yielding highly 
maneuverable craft that can ﬂy faster than the speed 
of sound—progress on undersea vehicles had been 
slow. As a result, submersibles still worked like the 
aquatic equivalent of hot air balloons, creeping 
around the oceans at the pace of a jellyﬁsh. 
Hawkes wanted to explore the concept of moving 
more efﬁciently through the ocean and create a sub 
that would grant unprecedented access to everyone 
from tourists and legislators to marine biologists. 
Soaring underwater, he decided, would take wings, 
and so he founded Hawkes Ocean Technologies 
(HOT), a skunkworks dedicated to building the 
Deep Flight family of winged submersibles. The 
prototypes began to take shape at HOT’s research 
facility, based at a marina in Richmond, Calif.
The Super Falcon, the fourth in the series, has its 
roots in one of the most ambitious undersea explora-
tory missions in modern history. In 2005, Hawkes 
teamed up with adventurer Steve Fossett to create a 
sub that could be piloted to the deepest part of the 
ocean—a spot in the Pacific named Challenger 
Deep, 36,201 feet below the surface. Fossett agreed 
to fund the sub, named Deep Flight Challenger, in 
hopes of setting the world record for a solo dive. But 
two years into the project, he plummeted from the

sky over Nevada in his single-engine Bellanca Super 
Decathlon. Ownership of the Challenger passed to 
Fossett’s estate when he died. But the technology 
developed for the Challenger still belonged to HOT.
As it happened, Hawkes got the opportunity to 
use that technology twice more: He was midway 
through constructing his own Super Falcon when 
venture capitalist Tom Perkins contracted him to 
build a submersible that could operate from his 
Maltese Falcon, one of the largest sailing yachts in 
the world. One Super Falcon was delivered to Per-
kins in November 2008; the other Hawkes ﬁnished 
and kept. The subs diverged from the Challenger in 
two significant ways: They carried two people 
upright, as opposed to one prone. And to avoid the 
extreme cost of building a hull 
to handle great depth, the team 
used a much cheaper and easier-
to-fabricate composite of their 
own design, called Sea Glass 11. 
The Super Falcon is rated to a 
depth of 1000 feet, but future 
iterations can be designed to go 
as deep as desired, and plans for 
such subs are already under way.

The inside of the Super Falcon is 
tight, but comfortable enough. 
Seating is recumbent, and my 
legs straddle a carbon-dioxide 
scrubber that, along with an oxy-
gen control at my right shoulder, 
keeps air in the pressurized hull 
breathable. Each of the two in-
line piloting positions has a full set of controls—
the throttle is to the left, and on the right is a ﬁnger-
tip ﬂy-by-wire joystick—but Hawkes, in the front 
position, has the master controls. Our eyes are just 
level with the chop as we cruise away from the 
launch; then Hawkes takes us down and we are 
enveloped by murky green water. Away from the 
waves and weekend boaters, the underwater atmo-
sphere is peaceful, and for a moment it feels as if 
we are ﬂoating motionless.
Hawkes coaches me on how to read the heads-
up display—which has an artiﬁcial horizon similar 
to an airplane’s instrument panel—then gives me 
control. Piloting the sub by joystick is as intuitive as 
a video game, but orienting myself in the watery 
gloom is difﬁcult and Hawkes warns me that I’m 
listing to the right. I correct the trim, then glide us 
gently back to the surface, where Hawkes takes the 
controls and puts my gentle wobbling in the water 
into perspective. He takes us down abruptly, 
descending so steeply it’s disconcerting. The water 
around us goes quickly from blue to dark green 
and, ﬁnally, to brown as we reach 50 feet. 
We could, in theory, be down here awhile. The 
Super Falcon has a 29-mile range and can run 
5 hours between battery charges. Its top speed is 
12 mph—not fast by land-speed standards, but 
positively sports-car-like for submersibles. It can 
glide and bank like a dolphin, even, Hawkes sus-
pects, perform barrel rolls—though I was sadly not 
the guinea pig for that maneuver.
The Super Falcon’s ability to move like marine 
animals—and keep up with them—makes it valu-
able for everything from ecotourism to scientific 
research. “Nobody has had a sub that can go that 
fast,” says John McCosker, chair of aquatic biology 
at the California Academy of Sciences. McCosker 
would like to use the Super Falcon to follow white 
sharks. “It could help us get a bet-
ter understanding of how they 
track prey prior to attack,” he 
says. “Plus, there may be behav-
iors we don’t even know about 
that we could only see by hanging 
out with these animals.” 
But getting the Super Falcon 
close to sea creatures is more 
than a matter of speed. Hawkes 
worked to minimize the sub’s 
electrical field—sharks, for 
instance, have electroreceptors 
that can detect even minute 
disturbances—and make it hum 
along as quietly as possible. He 
also kept lighting to a minimum. 
The bright lights used on con-
ventional subs, while necessary 
for some jobs, can scare away 
marine life. “If weapons-grade emissions are com-
ing from the lights,” Hawkes says, “you’re only 
going to see the stuff that’s deaf, dumb and blind.” 
Eventually, the team hopes to add a range of 
advanced technologies to the Super Falcon—sonar 
to detect obstacles, hydrophones to hear animals or 
boats before surfacing, and low-light cameras. The 
Super Falcon’s wings are already ﬁtted with lasers 
that can alert the pilot to obstructions a hundred 
feet or more ahead. Future subs may also have addi-
tional thrusters for hovering, as well as a robotic 
arm to collect scientiﬁc samples. 
In the dark water, I try toggling on the Super Fal-
con’s lasers, but Hawkes tells me the sub’s batter-
ies are too low. “Turn that switch off and hang on— 
we’re coming straight up,” he says, and we shoot 
toward the surface. We breach suddenly, popping a 
third of the sub out of the water. As I catch my 
breath, I hear Rosen over the radio. He’s concerned 
that sailboats are coming into the area and wants 
to tow the Falcon back to the launch. Hawkes tells 
him to hold off. “We’re doing one more,” he says, 
and no one argues. After all, it’s his vehicle.

Driving along Broadway in Sweetwater, Texas, one 
could justiﬁably assume the city is on its way down, not its 
way up. Cobwebs crowd the windows of abandoned store-
fronts, and peeling signs hang from cracked facades. It is 
only after I pull up to the mayor’s ofﬁce, pausing to study 
the street more carefully, that I notice a real clue to the 
city’s changing fortunes: The blond stone building is  neatly 
sandwiched between Craig A. Johnson, Independent Petro-
leum Landman, and Evans Enterprises, “Your source for 
wind turbine maintenance solutions.”   
Greg Wortham, the mayor of Sweetwater, is a compact 
man who, contrary to his West Texas roots, speaks quickly 
and easily, offering more information than is asked. As we

biggest wind projects are in

Clean Energy Update

turbines now produce more than 
8300 megawatts of electricity, enough 
to power about 2 million homes; 
nearly 3000 are produced in Sweet-
water’s Nolan County alone. In com-
parison, Vermont produces 6 mega-
watts; Oregon, 1408. Even California 
generates just 2781 megawatts from 
wind power, and it built its ﬁrst wind 
project nearly three decades ago.   
And that is the curious paradox of 
Texas: While seemingly more virtu-
ous states labor over environmental 
impact assessments, Texans see a 
business opportunity and grab it—
and so could very well end up leading 
the nation in clean energy. “In Texas, 
because we don’t care about the envi-
ronment, we’re actually able to do 
things that are good for the environ-
ment,” says Michael Webber, assistant professor of 
mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Aus-
tin. “It’s the most ironic, preposterous situation. If you 
want to build a wind farm, you just build it.”   
On private land, wind developers simply make a deal 
with landowners and pay them a royalty. But there’s no sit-
ing review process for wind farms on state lands, either. 
Plus, the state’s boundary extends 10.3 miles from the 
coast, a stipulation made by Sam Houston, Texas’s presi-
dent, before the republic joined the United States in 1845. 
Federal waters off all other coastal states begin 3 miles 
offshore, which means wind projects beyond that point—
such as Cape Wind, which was proposed for Nantucket 
Sound in Massachusetts in 2001—fall under the jurisdic-
tion of the Minerals Management Service.   
“If you’d like to build a wind farm off the coast of 
 Texas, you only have to deal with the Texas General Land 
Ofﬁce, and we’re a very eager leaser,” Jim Suydam, the 
ofﬁce’s press secretary, says. “My boss is a Texas Republi-
can. He’s an old Marine lieutenant colonel who carries a 
gun in his boot. But you’ll ﬁnd no bigger proponent of off-
shore wind power, because he sees it as a vital part of a 
diversiﬁed revenue stream for public education.” 
Offshore oil and gas production have contributed  
$6 billion to the Texas Permanent School Fund since it 
was established in 1854—but that source of income won’t 
rise forever, Suydam says. So this summer the Texas Gen-
eral Land Office signed two offshore wind leases with 
Houston-based Baryonyx; they were the state’s sixth and 
seventh. When the company goes into production, the 
state will take a cut—and resell the power. “It’s different 
than in California, where it’s all about carbon emissions,” 
Suydam says. “Here it’s all about making money.” 
Heat rises. So inside the cramped nacelle of a 
2-megawatt wind turbine, 260 feet above the West Texas 
plains, it’s easily 100 F—hot enough to give the gearbox a 
mirage-like haze, to cause my ﬁngers to fumble clumsily 
leave downtown in his silver Ford Escape Hybrid, he 
points to one low-slung building after another. “That’s a 
British company, Altezza. They work on the outside of the 
blades and towers, like spacewalkers. That building had 
been vacant for a dozen years, easily. This is General  
Electric—there’s 150 workers there. It used to be a Coca-
Cola storage facility. At one point, a quarter of all GE tur-
bines in the world were built here. Northwind moved into 
that one; it held a company that made deer blinds.” 
Along the narrow state road, warehouses evolve into 
wide-open plains where Black Angus cattle meander 
among the bases of sleek white turbines. I have to crane 
my neck in order to take them in. When the blades revolve 
to 12 o’clock, the turbines stretch to a height twice that of 
the Statue of Liberty and sport a wingspan greater than a 
747’s. As I peer out the window, Wortham identiﬁes tur-
bine models the way a bird-watcher ticks off species: The 
nacelles of Mitsubishis appear to have two eyes and a 
mouth on the back, he tells me. Siemenses have a tail ﬁn 
and are long and sleek like a bullet; General Electrics are 
shaped like a breadbox and Vestas turbines are cut across 
the bias with a clean diagonal line.  
The irony of this scenario in a state better known for its 
drilling rigs is not lost on Wortham. “If you picked 50 
states, plus D.C., and 
asked anybody in the 
U.S. to rank all 51 [for 
wind power], Texas 
would be somewhere 
around Mississippi,” he 
says, “at the bottom.”
ince the Spindletop 
gusher inspired the 
ﬁrst wave of wildcatters 
in 1901, Texas has had 
a history of going all 
out in the energy busi-
ness—but not in ways 
that are necessarily 
friendly to the environ-
ment. If Texas were a country—and Texans love to remind 
you that it once was a sovereign republic—it would rank 
seventh in carbon-dioxide emissions: Its economy 
accounts for more than a quarter of total U.S. natural gas 
production and oil reﬁnery capacity, and its residents con-
sume up to three times as much energy as residents of 
neighboring states.   
If it were a country, Texas would also rank sixth in wind 
power, after Germany, the U.S. as a whole, Spain, India and 
China. While U.S. wind-power capacity grew by 43 percent 
in 2007, in Texas it rose by 57 percent. All told, the state’s

Carbon 
Recycling
The Sunrise Ridge Algae pilot plant takes advantage of a copious resource: 
carbon dioxide. The gas is siphoned from the top of a stack at the Hornsby 
Bend Wastewater Treatment Facility in Austin, then pulled through a series 
of demisters and compressors (below). The CO2 percolates into reactors 
downslope where it feeds algae, later processed into biofuel.

Roscoe Wind Complex was completed this summer it 
became the largest wind project in the world. Initially, 
developers were reluctant to build turbines on farmland 
because it involved negotiating with so many landowners. 
So ﬁve years ago, retired cotton farmer Cliff Etheredge 
organized family and friends into one group, under one 
contract—then paid for his own anemometer tower and 
took the data to a developer’s door.  
“This is the ﬁrst time most of these landowners ever 
had a chance at a steady income,” says Etheredge, who has 
since started his own business as a wind developer. 
Because there’s not enough rain to recharge groundwater 
for irrigation, agriculture is touch and go. “Until recently, 
wind was a tremendous negative 
because it robbed us of our mois-
ture—the evaporation rate here is 
many times greater than our rainfall,” 
he says. “Now we’re able to sell the 
wind. And it’s a real blessing to us.” 
he Sunrise Ridge Algae test
farm sits deep within the Hornsby 
Bend Wastewater Treatment Facility 
in Austin, past mountains of fresh, 
dark Dillo Dirt—a compost made 
from treated sewage sludge and yard 
clippings—and just downslope from 
a pair of hulking anaerobic digesters. 
It looks less like a startup company 
than a squatters’ camp. Sheets of 
black plastic, crisscrossed by PVC pipes and rubber tubing, 
cover the ground. Sara Norris, the 24-year-old supervising 
engineer, greets me at the plastic storage shed that serves 
as the lab. “As I mentioned,” she says, “it’s very low-tech.”
Slim and suntanned, with hair swept back into a long 
brown ponytail, Norris leads me over to a row of flat, 
100-square-meter bags called helioreactors. The algae 
inside soak up the sun, doubling in number every other 
day. “You can step on them,” Norris tells me as she strides 
onto their surface in black work boots. “They’re really 
 hardy.” I follow. It’s only after warm water seeps through 
the permeable fabric and swirls around my exposed feet 
that I think about what’s inside: a mixture of nonpotable 
wash water and a nitrate- and phosphate-rich fertilizer, 
processed from sewage sludge. The algae love it; so, appar-
ently, do the ﬂies buzzing around my ankles.
A rancid smell wafts from the direction of the digest-
ers, where bacteria break down the wastewater, forming 
methane and carbon dioxide. The plant burns the gases 
off in a stack. “When you combust methane, it produces 
[even more] carbon dioxide, and we use that to feed our 
algae and modulate the pH in our bags,” Norris says. After 
with simple carabiners and to make the last few rungs of a 
narrow steel ladder feel interminably long. But just 10 feet 
higher, thermodynamics change. A strong, cool breeze 
blows steadily through the rope tethering me to the top of 
the hub, around the carbon-ﬁber blades that taper off into 
the blinding sun. I shade my eyes and look to the horizon: 
Neat rows of turbines spin steadily—an alternative energy 
crop thriving in America’s petroleum heartland.   
Dan Templeton pops his head and shoulders up 
through the hatch to triple-check that my harness is 
clipped in. As a wind technician, he has climbed hundreds 
of such towers; his rangy body can go from 0 to 300 feet in 
about 10 minutes. “This job has a certain romance to it 
because you’re working at such 
heights—there’s some perceived 
danger,” says Templeton, who now 
runs a program to train future tech-
nicians at Texas State Technical  
College in Sweetwater. This fall, 250 
students were enrolled. “It’s really 
not that dangerous,” he says, “but for 
your typical country boy who likes to 
work outside and with his hands, it’s 
the perfect job.”  
This year in Nolan County, the 
wind industry directly employed 
more than 1300 people. Some, like 
Bryan Gregory Jr., a third-generation 
potash miner, answered an ad in the 
paper and learned skills on the job. 
“Wind has taken very good care of me and my family,” he 
says. “I started at the bottom and worked my way up.” Now 
Gregory’s doing the hiring as a project manager at Bluarc 
Management Group, a renewable energy asset manage-
ment ﬁrm. “In wind, our guys are cross-functional,” he 
says. “They do everything from IT networking to mainte-
nance to electrical and mechanical troubleshooting to 
crane work.” This year, wind also provided Nolan County 
with more than 800 construction jobs.  
“Up until 2000, the only economic development for 10 
or 15 years was prisons,” Mayor Wortham told me. Wind 
power took off after Texas passed a renewable portfolio 
standard in 1999, mandating that utilities generate 2000 
megawatts of renewable energy by 2009. Coupled with a 
federal renewable-energy-production tax credit, turbines 
suddenly began to look proﬁtable to wind developers and 
to communities like Sweetwater. While driving me 
around, Wortham pointed out Highland High School—
both the old part, built in the 1930s, and the new $8 mil-
lion facility that will soon replace it. Property taxes on 
wind energy have poured more than $30 million into 
Nolan County’s economy, and in 2005 the population 
ﬁnally stabilized after a decades-long decline.   
Roughly 11,000 people live in Sweetwater, where rust-
brown pump jacks have long supplemented ranching 
income. Eight miles due west on Interstate 20 sits the cot-
ton capital of Roscoe. It has about 1300 residents and half 
as many wind turbines—when the fourth phase of the

Algae to Biocrude 
Sara Norris, a San Antonio native and mechanical engineer, 
supervises a pilot plant for Sunrise Ridge Algae, which grows 
algae in ﬂat, white helioreactors containing wastewater. Con-
verting the algae to fuel can help clean up both air and water 
pollution, she says. “Algae just made sense to me.”
a few days, the algae is harvested and settled in a tank, 
where it becomes a deep-green pesto-like paste. Then it’s 
dehydrated—for now, in propane dryers rigged from old 
ﬁling cabinets—and the resulting “algae crackers,” which 
look like sheets of nori, are loaded into a catalytic ther-
molysis unit off-site. A chemical conversion process turns 
the algae into crude bio-oil, which can be run through the 
existing energy infrastructure of reﬁneries and pipelines.       
“A really critical part of algae as a viable fuel or energy 
source is that you’re able to get things for free, like nutri-
ents and carbon dioxide,” Norris says. Texas produces 676 
million metric tons of CO2 a year, so the opportunities to 
site algae plants are almost endless. Norris rattles off likely 
candidates: cement plants, oil reﬁneries, even cattle feed-
lots. “The stoichiometry,” or the math behind the chemis-
try, “suggests that for every ton of algae you produce you 
consume one and a half tons of carbon dioxide,” she says. 
Algae operations can squeeze value from another copi-
ous Texas resource: brackish water. The dusty town of 
Pecos, in the southwestern corner of the state, used to be 
cotton country—but with only 9 inches of rainfall a year 
and saline aquifers, the surrounding fields have long 
since dried up. Today, saltwater algae swirls like pea soup 
in open raceways behind a Texas AgriLife Research Sta-
tion run by Texas A&M University. “It’s a traditional agro-
nomic society here, but algae’s a plant too,” Mike Foster, 
the station’s director, says. “If we can show the growers 
that this is going to work, they’ll be the ﬁrst ones to try it.”  
Several hurdles—some biological, some technologi-
cal—still need to be cleared. At Pecos, for example, scien-
tists are looking for an algae species that can withstand 
temperature swings ranging from blistering to freezing. 
Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, mean-
while, are experimenting with more efficient ways to 
extract oil from algal cells. But the payoff has the potential 
to be huge: Conservatively, algae can produce between 
2500 and 5000 gallons of fuel per acre per year; soy pro-
duces 50 and corn, 250. If successful, Texans will effectively 
leapfrog ﬁrst-gen biofuels to those poised to turn a proﬁt.
But the state’s real strength in the clean-energy 
 economy might lie in its entrenched dirty one. The Energy 
Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates that U.S. 
biofuel production reach 36 billion gallons a year in 2022; 
only 15 billion gallons can come from corn-based ethanol. 
But while cellulosic ethanol and algae companies have 
sprung up from Boston to California, few have made it past 
the pilot-plant stage of 10,000 or so gallons a year—let 
alone to the commercial phase of tens of millions. Texas, 
on the other hand, has more than 26 reﬁneries already pro-
cessing 7.4 million barrels of petroleum a day. 
“The biggest thing people fail to understand about 
energy is the scale,” UT’s Webber says. “We understand 
scale. We have scale of resource and scale of industry. If 
you want biofuels that satisfy 10 percent of our nation’s 
fuel consumption, which is required with the Energy 
Independence and Security Act, how are you going to pro-
duce and move and blend them? Energy, in the end, is 
about steel in the ground.”
In other words, biofuels may have to come through 
Texas one way or another. And oil companies—hedging 
their bets against future carbon regulation and declining 
production—have already begun to nudge open that door. 
BP, Shell and Chevron have all backed companies working 
on cellulosic ethanol and algae-based biofuels. This July, 
even the leviathan Exxon announced a $600 million 
investment in Synthetic Genomics, a biotechnology com-
pany engineering algae to continuously produce oil. 
“When you’re a small company and just trying things 
out, you’ve got to be as cheap as you can be,” Sunrise Ridge 
Algae’s CEO, Norman Whitton, says—even spiking helio-
reactors with Perrier for a quick ﬁx of CO2 when necessary. 
“We’re trying to pioneer technology,” he says, “but we 
know that in the long run, in order to be even remotely rel-
evant, it’s going to take an awful lot of investment.” 
Last year, the gross domestic product for Texas’s oil 
and gas industry was $200 billion. “We’re the headquarters

wind project in Pampa until these lines reach the panhan-
dle.) Plus, solar could provide power during the day when 
electrical demand is highest and wind is at its weakest.
According to the National Renewable Energy Labora-
tory, by developing less than 1 percent of its total land area 
for solar, Texas could generate enough electricity (without 
energy storage) to satisfy the state’s 2007 demand for more 
than 300 million megawatt-hours. So far, California leads 
the country with 528 megawatts of grid-tied solar, followed 
by New Jersey (70), Colorado (36) and Nevada (34). Less 
than 5 megawatts of solar power are grid-tied in Texas. 
But the state’s streamlined regulatory system could 
vault Texas to lead in solar power too. For example, this 
summer San Antonio’s utility signed a contract with Tes-
sera Solar for a 27-megawatt project in West Texas; the 
ﬁrst units are expected to come online by the end of next 
year. That pace stands in stark contrast to Tessera’s expe-
rience in California, where the company signed a contract 
for an 850-megawatt project in 2005 and only recently sub-
mitted the 5000-page impact assessment. While the scale 
of the two projects is vastly different, it is similar to 
 another moment in the two states’ history, such as when, 
in 1999, Texas’s 30-megawatt Delaware Mountain Wind 
Farm began operations on a Culberson County ranch. 
Texas didn’t build small wind projects for long.
The wind boom in Texas has been due, in part, to basic 
mechanics—turbines are a time-tested technology. Solar, 
by comparison, is still relatively immature. “The ﬂip side 
is that the potential for solar to come down in cost is much 
greater than that of wind,” B.J. Stanbery, HelioVolt’s chief 
strategy ofﬁcer and founder, says. In 
fact, the price of solar panels has 
already dropped 40 percent since last 
year. “So what happens when you 
have a cost-effective business oppor-
tunity in Texas?” Stanbery asks. 
“Well, we move in and take over.”

I-35 in Austin sprouts unusual land-
scaping: a row of 16-foot-high “sun-
flowers” with photovoltaic panels 
cupped like high-tech petals over 
welded steel stems. Brewster 
McCracken takes the next exit and, as 
we pass a shopping center, points out 
a green-built Home Depot and a

of the energy industry of today,” Texas state representative 
Mark Strama says. “That should be our biggest competitive 
advantage at being the headquarters of the energy industry 
of tomorrow.” He adds: “California has Silicon Valley, bil-
lionaires who made their money in technology who see 
renewable energy as the next Internet—and those guys are 
putting their money where their mouths are. What would 
totally eclipse all of our competitors is if the fossil fuels 
industry would say, ‘We’re going there.’”
With nearly 12 percent of the world’s silicon-processing 
capacity, Texas, as it happens, has a Silicon Valley of its 
own. Dallas-based Texas Instruments invented the inte-
grated circuit in 1958, and central Texas has since grown 
into a world leader of semiconductor chip manufacturing. 
“As a result, you have thousands of people who know how 
to lay microcircuitry on glass, which is basically how chips 
are made,” Steve Taylor, a senior manager of corporate 
affairs for Applied Materials, says. “And that’s the same 
concept for solar.”  
The fastest growing market for chip-based products—
cellphones, BlackBerries, laptops and iPods—has moved 
to Asia, taking semiconductor manufacturers with it. But 
the talent pool that remains behind in Texas is, in effect, 
already partially trained to work in a solar factory. “We 
have a huge market for solar panels, and we have a lot of 
empty space to put the panels out there,” Taylor says. “If 
Texas takes the initiative, it could be a center for not only 
solar-panel installation, both rooftop and utility scale, it 
could also create solar manufacturing jobs here.”
Applied Materials makes equip-
ment for manufacturing microchips 
in Austin and ﬂat-panel displays else-
where. Three years ago it used that 
expertise to begin making equip-
ment for thin-film solar panels, 
which it sells to factories overseas. So 
far there’s only one factory making 
solar panels in Texas, and it begins 
production this December. Austin-
based HelioVolt uses a thin-film 
technology too, but with copper 
 indium gallium selenide (CIGS) as 
the semiconductor instead of silicon. 
The company coats 2 x 4–foot sheets 
of glass with CIGS to form circuits, 
rather than discrete solar cells. These 
“photovoltaic integrated circuits” can be used for curtain 
walls, rooftops or ground-mounted solar installations. 
Texas has already proven that it can deploy a large-
scale renewable—wind. Soon, it will also have the trans-
mission lines to handle power from solar as well. Texas is 
the only state besides Hawaii and Alaska to have a self-
contained electrical grid—regulated by the Electric Reli-
ability Council of Texas, not the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission—and the Public Utility Commission  recently 
approved a $5 billion expansion to the windiest areas of 
the state. (T. Boone Pickens has delayed his plan to build a 

Are Green Jobs  
for Real?
From pure optimism to extreme skepticism, few contem-
porary buzzwords elicit such polarizing emotions as “green 
jobs.” Proponents say these jobs will ease not only unemploy-
ment but also climate change and the nation’s dependence 
on foreign oil. Skeptics question the sustainability of green 
jobs and the government’s ability to identify game-changing 
technologies. By some counts, we can look forward to 5 mil-
lion green jobs; by others, any surplus will be far outweighed 
by a net loss of jobs in other ﬁelds.   
The ﬁrst step in cutting through the hype surrounding 
green jobs is simply to deﬁne them. Some workers, such as 
energy auditors and solar-panel installers, have plied their 
trades for decades. But even jobs in emerging ﬁelds, such as 
smart-grid and electric vehicle development, repurpose age-
old professions such as electrician, mechanic and engineer. If

you count all the people working in clean energy, environmen-
tally friendly production, energy efﬁciency and pollution miti-
gation—as the Pew Center on the States recently did—and 
discount the people indirectly linked to those ﬁelds, such as 
accountants, there were 770,000 green jobs in the U.S. in 2007. 
(Nuclear energy also wasn’t counted.) In contrast, there were 
1.3 million people working in fossil-fuel sectors. 
If measured against every job out there, green jobs account 
for just 0.49 percent of employment. But Kil Huh, a project 
director at Pew, says the sector grew rapidly from 1998 to 2007. 
During that period the 
overall economy grew 
3.7 percent, while green 
jobs grew 9.1 percent. 
And according to the 
Economic Policy Insti-
tute’s Ethan Pollack, 
green jobs tend to be 
durable and better- 
paying. “Green invest-
ment results in a higher 
mix of production 
jobs,” Pollack says, 
“and pushes against a 
decades-long trend of 
manufacturing jobs 
disappearing and low- 
paying service jobs tak-
ing their place.” 
This initial robust 
growth was fueled pri-
marily by private investment. Ernst & Young, a ﬁrm that pro-
vides strategic guidance for clean technology companies, 
found that as of June 2008, 301 companies in the sector had 
attracted $7.3 billion in venture capital. Although the reces-
sion caused funding to drop nearly 50 percent in the ﬁrst three 
months of 2009 from the same period in 2008—overall venture 
capital decreased 61 percent, according to Pew—that early 
boost may help green companies better weather the downturn. 
“The clean energy economy was one of the few sectors that was 
better insulated,” Huh says. “Because of the increased spend-
ing at the federal level, its recovery should be a lot faster.”
Roughly $84 billion of the $787 billion American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has been allocated to initia-
tives, such as weatherization and battery research, aimed at 
stimulating green jobs. Already clean tech is showing signs of 
revival. Ernst & Young found second-quarter venture capital in 
the sector was up 73 percent from the ﬁrst quarter, thanks, in 
part, to conﬁdence stemming from increased government 
support. Jen Stutsman, a representative for the Department of 
Energy, which is responsible for disbursing nearly $37 billion 
in stimulus money, says a major goal of the Recovery Act was 
to “catalyze private investors to make investments in projects 
 e new hires in the weatherization 
unit of the Central Wisconsin 
Community A7ion Council 
(CWCAC) are a motley assemblage 
of recession refugees. A liﬆ of their 
former professions reads like a

mechanic, carpenter, roofer, 
plumber. Adam Faul inﬆalled ﬂoors 
for 13 years. But in 2008 proje7s 
ﬆarted drying up and by 2009 he 
was forced to look for other work. 
“When the economy nose-dived, I 
kind of went along with it,” he says. 
 is spring, Faul came across a 
job liﬆing for the CWCAC, which 
was hiring six new technicians to 
help low-income residents reduce 
their energy coﬆs.  e technicians 
are dispatched to homes, where, 
a7ing on recommendations from 
energy auditors, they inﬆall 
insulation, clean furnaces, seal air 
leaks, change light bulbs and 
replace ineﬃcient appliances and 
windows. With his background in 
home renovation and experience 
with power tools, Faul thought it 
seemed like an ideal new career. 
“Moﬆ of the guys who 
transitioned here from other jobs 
had conﬆru7ion skills, and they 
wanted to ﬆay in that ﬁeld because 
they enjoyed the work,” says Brian 
Bauer, who once inﬆalled gutters 
but now supervises the CWCAC’s 
four three-man weatherization 
crews. “ ere was no work leW for 
them. Now they’ve got ﬆable jobs.”
Faul, who ﬆarted in June, 
appreciates the ﬆability, but ﬁnds 
the work rewarding in another way 
too. “It seems like we’re really 
making a diﬀerence, like we’re part 
of a bigger pi7ure,” he says. “What 
we do is hard, physical work, but to 
me it seems diﬀerent. I don’t 
consider it juﬆ another job.”

From high-tech research

years of schooling and

they might not otherwise make now.”
Yet some question the government’s prescience when it 
comes to selecting worthy projects. Kenneth Green, a fellow 
at the American Enterprise Institute, cites the failed attempt 
to supplant fossil fuels with corn-based ethanol as a prime 
example of a taxpayer-backed swing-and-miss. “The govern-
ment is not good at picking winners,” he says. Richard Sylla, 
an economic historian at New York University, points to the 
Carter administration’s attempt to promote solar power. 
“The government subsidized people to put up solar panels,” 
he says, and when the price of oil came down “a lot of govern-
ment money was wasted.” 
But today, Sylla says, things might be different. “Even 
before the government came in, Wall Street and the venture 
capital crowd were interested,” he says. “Maybe solar power in 
the 1970s was premature, but 40 years later, it might work.” 
And Alex Klein, a research director at the consulting firm 
Emerging Energy Research, says the difference between etha-
102  D E C E M B E R  2 0 0 9   |   P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M
nol and this round of government intervention is that funding 
is not conﬁned to one nascent technology. Rather, the Recov-
ery Act money—in the form of federal loan guarantees, grants 
and tax credits—is spread across a broad range of technolo-
gies and companies. “They seem to be conscious that if they’re 
spending the taxpayers’ money, they’re not spending it on 
projects that aren’t coming to fruition,” Klein says. 
To weed out duds, Stutsman says reviewers from within the 
DOE, academia and energy ﬁelds carefully scrutinize potential 
awardees. Just how many jobs those projects create—and how 
many will be long-term—remains to be seen. For now, the 
green workforce continues to be a tiny fraction of overall 
employment, making only a slight dent in unemployment. But 
with clean energy technologies advancing quickly, a genuine 
green-collar economy may not be far off.

 How much cordless drill do you 
need? Probably not as much as you 
think. We’ve seen continuous improve-
ment in small drill drivers, especially 
since the introduRion of lithium-ion 
battery technology. Se new crop of 
12-volt drills looked promising, but  
we  wanted to know how well they 
would hold up when we really leaned 
on them. There’s only one way to 
answer a queﬆion like that. We gath-
ered seven drills with nearly identical 
features. Sen we drilled holes with a 
5⁄8-inch spade bit and drove 2-inch dry-
wall screws until the batteries gave 
out. Here’s our report.

HITACHI 
DS10DFL
Price: $100
what we liked 
Re Hitachi is a nimble little 
drill, thanks to a handle 
circumference that’s almoﬆ 
a half-inch smaller than the 
other produFs’. And like 
full-size drill drivers, it has a 
box-shaped battery  
mounted on the end of its 
handle, making it one of two 
tools we teﬆed that can 
reliably ﬆand up. (Re other 
was the Ryobi.)
what we didn’t 
If a drill as inexpensive as  
the CraTsman can have a 
single collar chuck that you 
don’t need two hands to 
operate, so can this tool. 
Hitachi should add one. Re 
two-speed seleFor switch is 
unnecessarily ﬆiﬀ and 
uncomfortable to use.
BOSCH MAX LITHEON 
PS30-2A
Price: $150
what we liked 
Flat-out screwdriving 
capacity. Rat’s where the 
Bosch really shines. It 
performs as if Bosch’s 
engineers took one of the 
company’s successful 
full-size drills (tools that  
have always done well  
in our teﬆs) and simply 
scaled it down.
what we didn’t 
It’s small potatoes (maybe 
even nano potatoes), but the 
Bosch needs a better grip 
surface on its chuck ring, and 
the two-speed slide switch is 
a little ﬆiﬀ.
MAKITA 
DF330DW
Price: $137
what we liked 
Ris was the only 10.8-volt 
tool in the teﬆ. Its smaller 
battery and motor result in 
very nimble performance. It’s 
about a half-pound lighter 
than anything else here, and 
it’s very slim around the 
handle at the trigger. And 
while the Makita lacks the 
overall drilling and driving 
chops of the other drills, it’s 
the beﬆ inﬆaller’s tool. It’s 
perfeF for boring small 
holes with a twiﬆ drill bit 
and driving or removing 
machine screws.
what we didn’t  
Re Makita lacks the  
power of its larger  
competitors—but that’s 
more an observation  
than a complaint. 
CRAFTSMAN NEXTEC 
11812
Price: $90
what we liked 
Low price and high perfor-
mance equal value. Rat’s 
pretty much the CraTsman 
in a nutshell. It turned in a 
respeFable performance in 
the drilling and driving teﬆs, 
and it’s easy to handle, with 
good grip surfaces and a 
nice, crisp clutch aFion.
what we didn’t 
Re aFion of the forward 
reverse switch was a bit 
ﬆicky. You can try switching  
the drill from forward to  
reverse and accidentally 
leave the switch set 
between the two. Hit the 
trigger, and it feels like 
you’ve got a dead battery.

MILWAUKEE M12 
2410-20
Price: $150
what we liked 
Torque and speed. Re 
Milwaukee has both, and it 
works faﬆer than anything 
else, especially when armed 
with the 5⁄8-inch spade bit. 
Re extra speed helped 
throw chips clear while the 
torque gave it extra oomph 
to twiﬆ the bit through wet 
wood or areas near knots. 
Everything about it suggeﬆs 
it was designed for people 
who work for a living. It’s got 
a big chuck with large 
numbers, and a handy 
lighted gauge that indicates 
battery charge.
what we didn’t 
If you’re like our teﬆers, and 
occasionally push the drill 
with one hand on the back of 
the housing, you cut down 
on the airﬂow to the motor 
through the rear vent.
RIDGID FUEGO 
R82008
Price: $140
what we liked 
If you’ve got a crowded 
toolbox, this is your tool. 
From the chuck to the back 
of the motor housing, it’s 
61⁄2 inches long, 1 inch 
shorter than competitors. 
And if you’re the kind of guy 
who leans on a drill, you’ll 
appreciate the tool’s 250 
in.-lb of torque, equaled only 
by the Milwaukee. Rat’s 
especially handy if you drill 
and drive in pressure-treated 
wood, hardwood or metal. 
Finally, it had the easieﬆ-
turning chuck ring of the 
seven tools in our teﬆ.
what we didn’t
Like the Milwaukee, the 
Ridgid vents air through the 
rear of the motor housing, 
and you can inadvertently 
choke oﬀ airﬂow by pushing 
the drill with one hand 
behind the motor.
RYOBI ONE-PLUS
HJP002K
Price: $80
what we liked 
We found the Ryobi’s 
no-frills design kind of 
refreshing. It was the only 
drill without a speed-sele\or 
switch. Its top speed was 
only 550 rpm, but it slogged 
along, drilling holes and 
driving screws. Re few 
features it had were helpful. 
It was also the only tool with 
a magnetic bit tray—and not 
some wimpy thing, either. 
Put a bit on that tray, and it’s 
there for good.
what we didn’t 
You need to use two hands 
to loosen and tighten the 
chuck around a bit. Given the 
advent of the single-collar 
variety, this is outdated.

 Drill teﬆs are 
getting tougher to 
judge because 
cordless tools keep 
getting better. All of 
the produEs here 
performed well—
beyond our 
expeEations. In 
faE, the top of the 
pack was almoﬆ 
too close to call.
If portability and 
screwdriving are 
important to you, 
then these ﬆubby 
drills probably make 
more sense than a 
larger tool. All of 
them ﬁt more easily 
into a crowded 
toolbox than do 
their 18-volt (or 
even 14-volt) 
counterparts. And 
as our teﬆs prove, 
they are all relent-
less drivers.
Qe real ques-
tion in deciding 
how much drill you 
need is the size and 
number of the 
holes you bore, and 
how quickly you 
need to bore them. 
We used a spade 
bit for our teﬆ 
because it really 
ﬆresses the tool. If 
you drill small holes 
in hardwood and 
soUwood (under 
5⁄8-inch diameter) 
using a twiﬆ drill 
bit, any one of 
these tools will 
serve nicely. For big 
holes, get a more 
powerful drill.

that uses two beveled lengths of wood.

snow from a passing plow.
Discontinued Du8s
I recently changed my furnace and 
du0work from a downdra4 to an 
overhead heating syﬆem. :e old 
syﬆem used du0s that ran through 
the house’s concrete slab ﬂoor. We 
have a high groundwater table, and 
sometimes the water penetrates the 
slab and enters the du0s, so I’d like to 
ﬁll the unused du0s if possible. Would 
expanding foam work?
Groundwater is a lot like politics: It’s all 
local. Regardless of the water table, 
you should take ﬆeps to reduce water 
problems around your house before 
you tackle the du8s. Ae ground should 
slope away from the house on all sides, 
and downspouts should discharge as 
far as possible from the foundation 
wall. I’d say that would have to be at 
leaﬆ 10 feet away. Also, 
contact a foundation 
drainage company to 
get an estimate for 
installing a perimeter 
drain around the slab.
With that taken care 
of, you’re going to have 
wood at an identical angle on a table 
saw or, lacking that, using a circular saw. 
Ae length of the pieces matches the 
width of what you are hanging. For large 
pi8ures, mirrors or cabinets, each cleat 
should be at leaﬆ 2 inches wide and 3⁄4
inches thick, faﬆened with 2-inch-long 
No. 6 or No. 8 wood screws. Assuming 
1⁄2-inch thick drywall, each screw would 
penetrate 3⁄4 inches into the framing lum-
ber. Aat’s plenty of holding power for all 
but the heaviest loads. Of course, if 
you’re sure there’s no wiring or plumbing 
running through the framing and you 
have a truly heavy load to hang, you can 
use an even longer screw. Ideally, the 
bottom cleat should be attached to two 
ﬆuds, with a pair of screws driven into 
each. If that’s not possible, you should 
still have plenty of holding power by 
attaching to one ﬆud and using a couple 
of hollow wall faﬆeners at the opposite 
end of the cleat. 
One small drawback of the French 
cleat is that it takes up at leaﬆ 1⁄2 to 3⁄4
inch of space behind whatever you’re 
hanging. To keep the obje8 from tipping 
againﬆ the wall, attach a spacer block 
to the wall or to the back of the frame.
Snowed In
Every year I put up a snow fence, and 
every year it doesn’t seem to do much 
good. I ﬆill get snow dri4s on my 
driveway. Should I bother with the 
fence again this year?
People oTen have the wrong idea about 
snow fences. Aey don’t prevent a driT— 
they juﬆ make the driT form where you 
want it to. A snow fence slows the wind 
and causes the snow to drop to the 
ground. If the fence is correctly posi-
tioned, the driT forms where it’s out of 
the way and where it will do the leaﬆ 
harm when it melts. Ae problem comes 
when people place a snow fence close 
to walks and driveways. Ais juﬆ ensures 
that the driTs form in the worﬆ spot—
right in the middle of the paved surface.
A rule of thumb for any snow fence: 
Its diﬆance away from the prote8ed 
area should be roughly 35 times its 
height. For a typical 4-foot-high fence, 
that’s at leaﬆ 140 feet away. Obviously, 
if that’s larger than the size of your yard 
(and you can’t put a fence on your neigh-
bor’s property) you should position it as 
far away as possible. Also consider 
planting a row of trees to take the place 
of a seasonally inﬆalled fence. Ae taller 
the trees grow, the more eﬀe8ive they 
become at blocking wind-driven snow.
Leaving a gap between the bottom 
of the fence and the ground causes the 
drift to form farther away from the 
fence, dramatically increasing its eﬀec-
tiveness—the gap prevents the fence 
from being buried by the driT it creates. 
For a 4-foot-tall fence, leave a gap of 6 
inches or so. Make the gap taller if you 
are positioning the fence in an area with 
tall grass and scrubby growth.
Next, the fence should be at leaﬆ 
several feet longer than the area it’s 
prote8ing, to keep snow from blowing 
around the fence edges. Ais also helps 
account for shiTs in the wind dire8ion, 
which range from 30 to 45 degrees.
Finally, to prevent the fence from 
being torn loose, faﬆen it upwind of its 
poﬆs, so the wind pushes the fence 
againﬆ each poﬆ, rather 
than pushing it away. To 
prevent the fence from 
being knocked over, 
brace the poﬆs and sup-
port the end with guide 
wires, especially if the 
end of the fence is near

Regreen Is Very Green
I’m a ﬁrﬆ-time homeowner, and I’ve 
seen a variety of environmental 
rating syﬆems applied to houses, 
such as silver, platinum and gold, for 
example. I’m intereﬆed in making my 
home as eco-friendly as possible, 
and I’d like it to meet these guide-
lines. Where do I ﬆart the process?
You’re probably referring to green 
conﬆru1ion and certiﬁcation guide-
lines under the Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED) 
program. That’s a process in which 
builders can have a third party certify 
that a house or commercial building 
meets a range of ambitious environ-
mental ﬆandards. LEED’s four levels 
(certified, silver, platinum and gold) 
are applied to new conﬆru1ion or to 
buildings that have been so com-
pletely rebuilt that they are essentially 
new ﬆru1ures.
Since you’re talking about an exiﬆ-
ing ﬆru1ure, your beﬆ bet is to look 
into regreen guidelines. Regreen is 
not a certiﬁcation process. Inﬆead, 
it’s an extremely thorough guide for 
remodeling contractors and home-
owners interested in improving all 
aspects of a home’s environmental 
performance. @e guidelines are the 
produ1 of a collaboration between 
the American Society of Interior 
Designers Foundation and the U.S. 
Green Building Council (the nonproﬁt 
organization that created LEED certi-
ﬁcation and promotes it).
You can download the guidelines 
at regreenprogram.org. @e document 
is one of the beﬆ of its type that I’ve 
seen. In 164 pages, it covers topics 
ranging from reusing kitchen cabinets 
to ﬆopping air inﬁltration through a 
garage ceiling. Furthermore, it con-
tains numerous links to other sites 
that can dramatically speed your 
research into green remodeling.
Steam Ahead?
Would it be possible to repair heel 
dents in my oak ﬂoor by placing a 
damp cloth over them and using a 
clothes iron on the high setting to 
raise the wood grain? Ais technique 
worked for me on wood paneling, 
but I’m concerned it might damage 
the ﬂoor’s polyurethane ﬁnish.
It’s possible you could raise a small 
dent using the method you describe, 
but it might do more harm than good. 
@e combination of heat and moiﬆure 
can wreck a ﬂoor’s ﬁnish. I submitted 
your queﬆion to the technical advis-
ers at the National Wood Flooring 
Association. Their verdict: Sand the 
ﬂoor to take out the dents.
Red oak is a tough material and it 
takes a lot of force to dent it. Yet as 
tough as it is, it can be readily dam-
aged by high heels and other concen-
trated loads such as the feet of heavy 
furniture. A variety of studies have 
found that high heels produce a pres-
sure of several hundred to 2000 psi, 
depending on weight and the surface 
area of the heel. Concentrated in a 
tiny heel, a woman’s weight is enough 
to damage the hollow tubes that

idea. So, for ﬆarters, you may need to 
reﬁnish the ﬂoor. ;en you can work

sation turns out.
Ice Out
Our house is only a few years  
old, as is its refrigerator. We can’t 
underﬆand why the icemaker 
behaves so erratically. We’ve had a 
technician in to look at it, and he 
can’t ﬁnd a problem.
I’m willing to bet the refrigerator is 
conneDed to the kitchen sink’s water 
filter. Many refrigerators require at 
leaﬆ 40 psi of water pressure in order 
to make ice. ;e problem is that a ﬁlter 
can cut that pressure subﬆantially, as 
much as 30 percent if it’s a reverse-
osmosis type or a clogged carbon ﬁl-
ter. When incoming water pressure to 
the house is only 40 to 50 psi to begin 
with, that will cause problems for the 
ice maker. If your refrigerator has a 
cold-water dispenser, you can teﬆ for 
low pressure by timing how long it 
takes to fill a typical drinking-water 
cup. It should take no more than about 
20 seconds or so.
Replace the water ﬁlter if you sus-
peD that it’s clogged, or consider buy-
ing a booﬆer pump that will supply 
the icemaker with water at the cor-
rect pressure. (Your refrigerator’s 
owner’s manual should specify the 
correD pump.) Likewise, if the manu-
facturer recommends against a 
reverse-osmosis ﬁlter, you’ll have to 
inﬆall a new piece of supply tubing to 
bypass the ﬁlter.
If the problem isn’t a water ﬁlter, 
check the saddle valve that regulates 
water flow to the refrigerator. The 
valve is a simple device that clamps 
over the copper supply tube leading to 
the icemaker. There are two types. 
One, called a nonpiercing (or drill) type, 
requires that a hole be drilled into the 
supply tube before the valve is 
inﬆalled. ;e other is known as a self-
tapping saddle valve. It has a pointed 
tip that punDures the tube. “;e hole 
created by these self-tapping valves is 
much smaller than the drilled hole,” 
says Chris Zeisler, a repair technician

self-piercing valve is prone to plugging 
from mineral or other deposits. ;ey 
shouldn’t be used in icemaker inﬆalla-

piercing or drill-type valve may well 
solve the problem.
Crumbling Concrete
?e surface of my concrete driveway 
is crumbling because of road salt. 
Can I use a sealer on it to prevent 
further crumbling?
;e condition you describe is known 
as scaling, and before you slather on 
the sealer, you should get some pro-
fessional advice from a local company 
that specializes in concrete reﬆora-
tion and ﬁnishing. 
;at probably sounds like draﬆic 
advice for such a simple-sounding 
queﬆion, but there’s good reason for 
it. Exterior concrete is supposed to be 
able to withstand normal de-icer 
chemicals. When it doesn’t, that could 
mean several things, none of them 
good: Either the concrete wasn’t pro-
duced with an air-entraining cement 
or a similar admixture, it wasn’t prop-
erly finished, or it wasn’t properly 
cured. (Air-entrained concrete con-
tains micro scopic air bubbles—as 
many as 300 to 500 billion per cubic 
yard, according to the Portland 
Cement Association. ;e voids allow 
ice crystals to form, then melt and 
reform without damaging the con-
crete’s surface.) 
If the damage is spreading, and it 
likely will, a concrete reﬆoration com-
pany will know the beﬆ overlay to deal 
with it in your region and climate, as 
well as how to prepare the driveway 
prior to applying an overlay. ;e reﬆo-
ration experts may also recommend a 
sealer to reduce water penetration 
through the surface.

Old-School 
Ignition Tech
GOT A COLLECTOR CAR WITH 
IGNITION POINTS? HERE’S HOW 
TO REPLACE THE POINTS AND 
SET THE TIMING. BY MIKE ALLEN
Ris Chevy V8  
uses an old-school 
Kettering-ﬆyle 
ignition diﬆributor. 
To set the timing 
aOer replacing the 
points and 
condenser, you’ll 
need, no surprise, 
an old-fashioned 
ﬆroboscopic 
timing light.

pm do-it-yourself
every mechanic and a 
lot of vehicle owners 
underﬆood the theory 
and pra6ice of chang-
ing points and setting 
the timing. Nonethe-
less, there are still 
plenty of older vehi-
cles, outdoor power 
equipment, boats and 
tractors that need 
periodic adjustment 
or replacement. 
?e diﬆributor on 
these older vehicles 
performs two related 
tasks. ?e ﬁrﬆ uses a 
simple on/oﬀ switch, 
the ignition points, to provide properly 
timed pulses of 12-volt ele6ricity to 
the ignition coil. In the coil, essentially 
a transformer, it’s stepped up to 
10,000 to 20,000 volts. ?en, the high-
voltage ele6ricity from the coil returns 
to the distributor, where the rotor 
inside parcels it out to the correct 
spark plug to ignite the fuel/air mix. 
?ere’s a lobed cam on the diﬆribu-
tor shaJ that pushes on a small rubbing 
block on the movable side of the points. 
As the cam and diﬆributor rotate, the 
points open and close conﬆantly. As 
they close, current from the ignition 
switch ﬂows through the conta6s into 
the coil’s primary windings and then oﬀ 
to ground. This current generates a 
magnetic field in the coil’s iron core. 
When the points open a few degrees of 
crankshaJ rotation later, the current is 
interrupted, causing the magnetic ﬁeld 
to collapse. ?is induces ele6rical cur-
rent into the secondary windings of the 
coil, where the current is raised to 
20,000 volts or more. ?e high voltage 
now travels over to the distributor, 
where the rotor metes the high-voltage 
pulses out to the corre6 spark plug. 
All that current ﬂowing across the 
points doesn’t like to ﬆop suddenly, and 
can initiate a small arc, which eventually 
erodes the tungﬆen conta6s. ?e con-
denser cushions that arc, making point 
life much longer. But not inﬁnitely long. 
As the conta6s and the plaﬆic rubbing 
block, which conta6s the point cam, 
wear, the ignition points’ clearance and 
timing conﬆantly change. AJer thou-
sands of miles, the timing has shiJed 
enough to aﬀe6 performance, and the 
ritual of changing the points and setting 
the timing becomes necessary. How 
oJen? Some vehicles need to have the 
timing adjusted as often as every 
10,000 miles to maintain peak perfor-
mance. High-revving engines will need 
premium points with a high-pressure 
spring to keep the points from bouncing 
at increased revs. Some points assem-
blies include the condenser, yet for oth-
ers, it’s a separate part. Condensers are 
inexpensive enough that it makes no 
sense not to replace them with every 
set of points. ?ey should laﬆ as long as 
a set of points, 20,000 miles at leaﬆ.
On Point
  e fun"ion of the ignition sys-
tem is to ﬁre the spark plugs at the cor-
re6 time, juﬆ before the piﬆon hits top 
dead center (TDC) on the compression 
stroke, to ignite the fuel/air mixture, 
thence producing high pressure in the 
cylinder to force the piﬆon down and, 
subsequently, the wheels to move the 
car forward. The spark plug normally 
ﬁres anywhere from 10 to 45 degrees 
before the piﬆon reaches TDC, to allow 
the fuel/air mixture’s ﬂame front to tra-
verse the combuﬆion chamber. It takes 
a few milliseconds for the pressure in 
the cylinder to build, and waiting until 
TDC would make the pressure peak too 
late in the piﬆon’s downward ﬆroke to 
be moﬆ eﬃcient. Under some engine-
operating conditions, the advance 
might adjuﬆ the ignition timing to as 
much as 45 degrees before TDC. Signs 
of incorre6 ignition timing include hard 
ﬆarting, spark knock, poor power, over-

Advanced Timing 
There are two main types of 
advance mechanism built into the dis-
tributor. The first is the centrifugal 
advance. A pair of bob-weights spin 
atop the diﬆributor shaJ, reﬆrained  
by small springs. As the engine speeds 
up, centrifugal force pulls the weights 
outward, which in turn makes the top

Charles F. “Boss” Kettering was one of the founders of Delco, and the inventor of the 
battery-point-ﬆyle ignition syﬆem, ﬁrﬆ used by Cadillac in 1910. Wear, inaccuracy and 
high maintenance have forced car manufaQurers to abandon this syﬆem, replacing it with 
computers and individual ignition coils for every cylinder—and no points to wear out.

Setting Dwell
of the split diﬆributor sha1 advance. 
Missing springs or a gummed-up link-
age can give too much advance too 
soon, or none at all.
Similarly, a vacuum advance uses a 
rubber diaphragm to advance or retard 
the timing. Vacuum from the carburetor 
pulls on one side of the diaphragm, pull-
ing the points around the distributor 
and making the plugs ﬁre earlier. A leaky 
vacuum line, a disintegrating rubber dia-
phragm or a ﬆicky breaker plate can 
make the advance mechanism balky. 
Inoperative advance mechanisms 
can deliver too much or too little igni-
tion advance. Too much advance can 
make the engine ping. Too little causes 
power loss and overheating.
Inﬆalling the new points and con-
denser is simple, and usually requires 
no more than a screwdriver. Fe propor-
tion of time the diﬆributor’s cam keeps 
the points closed and open is referred 
to as dwell angle. Adjuﬆ the dwell angle 
initially by using a feeler gauge. Moﬆ  
V8 American iron should be adjuﬆed  
to 0.018 to 0.020 inches, while four- 
cylinder engines, like early VWs, ﬆart 
around 0.014 inches. Close is good 
enough, because the only really accu-
rate way to set dwell is with a—wait for 
it—dwell meter. Fe dwell angle should 
be 30 to 35 degrees for V8s and 44 to 
50 degrees for four-cylinder engines. 
Check the shop manual for your car. 
Attach the dwell meter to the coil’s low-
voltage leads and spin the engine with 
the ﬆarter motor to check and trim the 
dwell. Some cars have a small window 
in the diﬆributor to let you set dwell 
with the car running, a real timesaver 
because you don’t have to crank the 
engine with the starter, adjust the 
points and check the dwell again. 
Cleanup in Bay 4
 Before you button up the diﬆribu-
tor, clean the point contaTs of any oil 
le1 behind by your feeler gauges. Con-
tamination will carbonize and become a 
resiﬆance where there should be only 
metal-to-metal contact. I usually just 
use the corner of a business card to 
scrub any contamination oﬀ. Add a dab 
of point-cam lube to the rubbing block. 
Adjusting dwell also changes the 
Changing the clearance in the points aﬀeFs the 
proportion of time the points are closed (“dwell”)

needed to properly adjuﬆ the dwell angle, which is 
done with the engine spinning on the ﬆarter 
motor or, on some engines, aFually idling.
base ignition timing, so whenever the 
dwell is adjuﬆed or the points replaced, 
the timing will need to be adjusted. 
Some engines call for vacuum lines to 
be pinched off or disconnected, so  
you’ll need to ﬁnd the correT timing 
procedure for your engine in the shop 
manual. I’ll wait ...
Got the timing specs? Find the tim-
ing marks on the harmonic balancer or 
on the ﬂywheel. Use some contraﬆing 
paint or a felt pen to brighten the timing 
mark. Hook the timing light to the No. 1 
plug wire. Start the engine, and shine 
the timing light at the timing marks. 
Mind the whirling fan and the belts, 
reminds my old-timer mechanic pal 
Le1y. Fe ﬆrobing light will “ﬆop” the 
spinning pulley when the No. 1 plug ﬁres. 
Loosen the clamp holding the diﬆributor 
down and slightly rotate the body of 
the distributor to line up the timing 
marks. Revving the engine slightly should 
make the mechanical advance aTuate—
you’ll see the timing marks advance  
and retreat as the engine surges. Tighten 
the distributor clamp, reconnect any 
 vacuum lines and drive.

Reducing the 
mass of caﬆ 
iron in brake 
discs is one way 
to trim coﬆs, 
but it comes at 
a reduFion in 
brake perfor-
mance. 
Q
I needed new disc brakes for my car, but the 
repair shop wanted so much money for the 
parts alone, I went to the auto parts store up the 
street and bought them myself. But when I showed 
up at the shop to have them do the installation, the 
manager took one look and refused to install the 
brakes. He said they were poor “oﬀshore knockoﬀs,” 
and likely to kill me and my family. I was a little 
annoyed—until we both calmed down and he showed 
me the diﬀerence in the parts. Ie ones I bought were 
much lighter, because the metal was thinner at 
almost every spot. So I took them back. Ie parts-
store clerk said these were special “lightweight” 
brakes, and would actually help me save gas. Iey 
wouldn’t refund my money, but would let me swap 
them for a diﬀerent set identical to the ones the 
brake shop wanted to install, right down to the brand 
on the box—and they wound up costing me more 
than the brake shop would have charged me in the 
ﬁrst place. Is it legal to sell these lightweight brakes?
Weight 
Watchers
A
Legal, yes. As to their being light-
weight, they certainly are. A good 
idea? Probably not. There are increas-
ing numbers of these offshore, low-
quality brake discs showing up on 
shelves lately. They use less cast iron 
and have thinner flanges and fewer, 
thinner cooling vanes then the OEM 
equivalents. Brakes transform the 
kinetic energy in your vehicle to heat. It 
takes mass, in the form of that cast 
iron, to capture the heat, and then sur-
face area to dissipate the heat to the 
air. Less mass equals poorer brake per-
formance in high-speed stops. Fewer 
vanes equals poorer performance in 
sequential stops or on long downhill 
grades. In both cases, that’s bad, dude. 
Ie failure mode here is when the fric-
tion material gets hot enough to boil,

SUV with seatbelts that are slow 
to retra/. 1e belts require a little 
help so that they don’t get caught in 
the door when we get out. Can they 
be lubricated?
I’ve ﬁxed a bunch of seatbelt retrac-
tors. Usually, they are gummed up by 
lint, dog hair, and in one case what 
seemed to be the majority of a bottle 
of ﬆicky soda.
Warning: Do not attempt this if 
your vehicle uses seatbelt pretension-
ers, which are more complicated, and 
are, in some cases, driven by the same 
kind of pyrotechnics as an airbag.
Remove the seatbelt retractor 
from its mounting, which will proba-
bly mean removing some interior 
trim. Don’t remove the belt’s web-
bing, or you ﬆand the chance of let-
ting the whole thing unwind like a 
cheap window blind. Clean as much 
gummy lubricant and dirt out of the 
forcing the pad surface to ﬂoat above 
the iron discs on a grounds-effect 
cushion of vaporized binder, leaving 
you with a spongy pedal and no brak-
ing power. Extreme cases of over-
heating can boil the brake ﬂuid, leav-
ing you with no brakes until they cool.
Kere are a half-dozen manufaLur-
ers of brake discs in this country, and 
more overseas, that make discs virtu-
ally indiﬆinguishable in quality from 
the ones inﬆalled on your car the day 
it was made. Stick to brand names, 
and you should be ﬁne. Saving money 
on brakes somehow doesn’t sound 
like a good idea, especially when the 
diﬀerence is only 20 or 30 bucks. As 
for saving gas because the discs are 
lighter? I don’t think so.

retra/or? I have a relatively new

Cheap Insurance
I have a 1998 New Beetle TDI 
(diesel) that had its Check 
Engine light come on. A VW 
dealer found a ruﬆ-frozen 
waﬆegate rod. He lubed it 
and moved it back and forth. 
However, he said the problem 
would probably come back. 
Since the part is not available 
separately from VW, I would 
have to buy the entire 
turbocharger. Inﬆalled, that 
will run a whopping $2200. Is 
there a way of getting only 
the oﬀending part and 
replacing juﬆ that? Will 
running the engine this way 
damage anything?
The wastegate bleeds off 
excess exhauﬆ from the turbo 
to keep the intake-manifold 
pressure from getting too  
high. Just because the part 
isn’t available directly from  
VW doesn’t mean it’s unavail-
able. Hunt around for the part 
inﬆead of juﬆ believing what 
the dealership tells you. And, 
frankly, freeing up and oiling a 
moving part once every 10 
years sounds like the cheapeﬆ 
solution. Maybe, if you lubed

penny’s worth of Nevr-Seez, it wouldn’t

Will not fixing this damage your 
engine? Depends. If it sticks open, 
dumping the wastegate all the time, 
you’ll have little power. If it ﬆicks closed, 
you could overboost the engine and 
melt or break a piﬆon.
Lights Oﬀ
My Ford Explorer’s battery was drawn 
completely dead by the interior lights 
when someone le7 the door ajar for a 
full week. Can I jump-ﬆart my Explorer 
with cables and drive 100 miles 
without damaging the alternator?  
I have been warned that the alternator 
will be damaged.
I know, I know; we’ve all jump-ﬆarted 
cars many times and haven’t damaged 
anything yet, right? On the other hand, 
the large amount of current needed to 
operate late-model cars with eleKric 
fuel pumps, fuel injeKion and gobs of 
electricity-consuming accessories is 
daunting. That’s why most cars have 
100-amp or larger alternators. Running 
all that ﬆuﬀ while trying to resuscitate 
a really dead battery can make an alter-
nator overheat. Black, crispy wiring = 
bad. Alternator manufacturer Bosch 
warns that alternators can indeed be 
damaged this way. A decent charger is 
less than a new alternator.
To reduce the current your poor 
alternator is going to have to produce 
to charge that battery, Bosch—
and I—recommend charging the battery 
3 to 4 hours with a proper battery char-
ger before ﬆarting the car. If that’s not 
feasible, do this: Start by hooking up the 
jumper cables to the two batteries and 
letting them chat for a half-hour or so. 
Don’t run the engine on the donor car. 
Wis will put at leaﬆ some charge into 
the dead battery. Wen ﬆart the donor 
car and let it run at faﬆ idle for 10 to 15 
minutes to add some more charge. 
Now ﬆart the dead car, but turn oﬀ as 
many accessories as you can. Speciﬁ-
cally, don’t use the air conditioning, 
headlights, rear-window defroﬆers or 
any other high-power devices until the 
car has been driven for a couple of

about 14 inches long from the center of

Adding the crowfoot will multiply the 
torque by 14.75/14, or a little more 
than 105 percent. Measure your crow-
foot and wrench to find the specific 
multiplier for your application. If you 
were to make or buy an extension that 
moved the torque wrench back exaKly 
14 inches, then the torque on the bolt 
would be exactly double what the 
wrench is set to. Sometimes, I juﬆ use 
a combination wrench as a torque mul-
tiplier. Do the math to ﬁgure what you 
need to dial up on the wrench to 
achieve the correK faﬆener torque.
Diesel Woes 
I own a 2009 Jetta TDI like your 
long-term teﬆ car (in the Auguﬆ ’09 
issue). I too had the experience of 
purchasing contaminated fuel. I fueled 
up my car with diesel and as I was 
leaving it sounded like I was dragging 
chains. By the time I went to exit the 
service ﬆation the car was nonfunc-
tional. I had it towed to the neareﬆ 
VW dealer and was told that I had 
contaminated fuel. But, unlike your 
teﬆ car, I had to pay $450 to have the 
fuel syﬆem ﬂushed out.
Gasoline burns far more rapidly than 
diesel, and the chain-like noise you 
heard was detonation, similar to the 
ping you get in a gas engine running on 
low-oKane fuel. Continued operation 
under these conditions could damage 
your engine, so be glad it shut down 
right away.
Obviously, somewhere along the 
diﬆribution chain, gas got mixed with 
diesel fuel. Wat gas ﬆation owes you 
$450 and the coﬆ of the tow. You, and

or at least avoid stop-and-go traffic. 
You’ll be better oﬀ with the engine spin-
ning and the alternator’s cooling fan 
spinning along rapidly to keep the alter-
nator from frying itself. Start saving 
money in the cookie jar for a new bat-
tery. Deep-discharging a flooded-cell 
lead-acid car battery like yours, even 
once, will permanently damage it.
Torque to Me
I am changing the front ﬆruts on my 
’05 Ford Explorer. Xe manual says I 
need to torque the bolt that mates the 
ﬆrut to the lower control arm to 258 
7-lb. I looked everywhere for a big 
enough torque wrench. It looks like all 
the torque wrenches peak at 250 7-lb! 
I also researched impa\ wrenches, 
and they have the torque required, but 
I wonder if they’re accurate.
An impaK wrench is not an acceptable 
way to torque anything, even a lug nut. 
Were are larger torque wrenches, but 
you’d need to go to an 
auto parts store or an 
industrial supply house. 
For serious torquing, they 
make gear-driven torque 
multipliers that can 
increase the torque value 
on the wrench by as 
much as eightfold. Of 
course, that’s overkill for 
your job. I would juﬆ set 
the torque wrench to 
250 d-lb, and give it one 
tiny twiﬆ more ader the 
click. For that matter, the 
diﬀerence between 250 
and 258 ft-lb is about 
3 percent, and I doubt 
the wrench calibration is 
closer than that.
Not faﬆidious enough 
for you? Let’s try this. Put 
an open-end crowfoot on 
the end of the torque 
wrench instead of a 
socket, which will extend 
the wrench about three-
quarters of an inch. My 
half-inch torque wrench is

Ce second part of the artiﬆic equa-
tion is soHware. No two artiﬆs have 
the same ﬆyle or technique, and juﬆ as 
analog artiﬆs work in acrylics, water-
colors, oils or inks, digital artiﬆs have a 
broad tool set of art programs available 
to them. Pro art soHware is enormously 
capable, but can get expensive and eye-
glazingly complex. Adobe Photoshop 
($700), for inﬆance, has artiﬆic tools 
that go way beyond its core photo-
manipulation functionality. Corel 
Painter ($500) digitally mimics the pro-
cess of using traditional media such as 
oil and pastels. And Autodesk Maya 
($3495) is sophiﬆicated 3D modeling 
soHware. But any of these programs 
can take years to maﬆer. 
For newbies, many of the same com-
panies that make pro software also 
have lower-priced programs such as 
Adobe’s Photoshop Elements ($100), 
Corel’s Painter Essentials ($100) and 
Sketch Pad ($120), and Autodesk 
SketchBook Pro ($100). These are 
easier to learn and far friendlier to the 
wallet. (Wacom tablets generally come 
with two free art soHware downloads, 
so some of these programs can be had 
for no coﬆ.) Ce soHware that ﬁts your

Moﬆ of these programs have a fairly 
similar logic and set of tools. Ce con-
cept of layering, for example, is perva-
sive. Drawing and editing images in lay-

Layered Look”). As you work, you can 
turn individual layers on and oﬀ, allow-
ing you to experiment without losing 
your previous work. Don’t like your char-
a6er’s hands? Turn that layer oﬀ and 
try drawing a set of lobﬆer claws.
Palettes of tools such as paint-
brushes, pencils, chalks and airbrushes 
are common to moﬆ soHware; colors 
can be mixed on screen and brush sizes 
and shapes dialed in to your speciﬁca-
tion. Some soHware even allows you to 
specify the chara6er of the paper or 
canvas you are working on. Ce more 
you explore each program, the more 
fun6ionality you’ll discover. And you can 
use different programs in tandem. A 
drawing ﬆarted in Painter Essentials 
can be opened in Photoshop Express, 
where you can tinker with new eﬀe6s.
Once you ﬆart experimenting, you’ll 
ﬁnd plenty of options that are easy in 
the digital world but would have been 
painﬆaking or even impossible in the 
physical world. For inﬆance, you can 
take a digital photo, import it as a 
source layer in Painter, trace over it and 
end up with a photo-accurate illuﬆra-
tion. (If you don’t want to import the 
photo digitally, lay a printout over your 
tablet and trace dire6ly over it.) 
Any miﬆakes are easily erased, and 
as you work, you are conﬆantly creat-
ing scenery, chara6ers and other ele-
ments that you can cut and paﬆe into 
new work. For my creatures, I have a 
library of perfe6ly executed alien heads, 
serpent eyes, claws, hooves and various 
antennae that I go back to all the time.
When you get good enough, you 
can print your work dire6ly to canvas 
using online services such as Canvas 
On Demand or Canvas People, and 
then put them up for sale at etsy.com. 
Or you can make T-shirts and mugs 
and sell them at cafepress.com. Juﬆ 
because you’re an artiﬆ doesn’t mean 
you have to ﬆarve.

Ce base layer is for 
brainﬆorming with a 
light-colored pencil tool. 
Use the space to rough  
out multiple ideas.
Pick out your beﬆ ideas and 
redraw them into the next

your point of view.
Add another layer under-
neath the sketch layer for 
color. Experiment with 
various brushes and  
tools to add texture.
On the uppermoﬆ layer, 
trace over your sketch with

What the 
cold can 
do to your 
phone
to
minutes before bringing the tempera-
ture down by 10 degrees. We repeated 
this incremental temperature drop 
every half-hour until the phones ﬆopped 
working. Once a phone died, we gave it 
one laﬆ dash of mercy by bringing it 
back to room temperature to see if 
warmth could revive it.
Other than minor hiccups (slight 
screen dimming, slow key response), 
none of the phones had any real prob-
lems down to minus 10 F, when the 
low-battery indicator popped up on one 
Samsung, despite the faS that it had 
recently been charged. At minus 20, the 
same phone shut oﬀ (plugging it in and 
turning it on quickly revived it), and the 
displays of some of the other phones 
were diﬃcult to read.
Thirty below is where the real

People tend to assume that 
extreme cold and mobile devices 
just don’t mix. After all, cold tempera-
tures can freeze liquid-crystal displays 
and slow the chemical reaction that 
gives lithium-ion batteries their charge.
But bringing phones into the cold is 
unavoidable—if you’ve ever gone skiing, 
or you simply live in Chicago, you’ve 
certainly spent hours in a freezing envi-
ronment with nothing more than a layer 
of denim or a jacket pocket to shield your 
phone from the chill. 
ExaSly how cold can a phone get 
before it ﬆops working? We decided to 
find out. For help, we called up our 
friends at Environ Laboratories, an envi-
ronmental teﬆing facility in Minneapolis 
used by the defense, aerospace and 
technology industries to simulate 
extreme conditions. We gave Environ a 
sample of six phones from various 
manufaSurers. Bese models were the 
type of commodity phones that service 
providers o`en give away for free with 
new contraSs—none was billed as “rug-
gedized” or designed to withstand 
extreme temperatures. Environ’s job 
was to freeze the gadgets in a 
temperature-controlled chamber (low-
eﬆ possible setting: minus 100 F) until 
all six phones stopped working—no 
matter how much cold that required. 
In other words, we decided to push 
these phones way beyond the limits of 
their design parameters and warranties.
Beginning at 40 F (the equivalent 
of a brisk autumn evening in New Eng-
land), we let each phone run for 30 

pm do-it-yourself

 ankfully, Apple has published a liﬆ 
of known problem programs on its web-
site (check under “Support”). So while 
you probably have nothing to worry 
about compatibility-wise, it’s a good idea 
to check this liﬆ before upgrading, juﬆ 
to make sure that nothing you rely on will 
be put out of commission.
Automatic Auto-Tune
I’m into making my own music and 
have tried using Auto-Tune so6ware to 
modulate my voice to sound like T-Pain 
or Kanye Weﬆ. Trouble is, the 
so6ware seems fairly complex. Is 
there an easier way of doing it?
Auto-Tune soFware has long been used 
by recording artists to nail wayward 
vocal tracks to a precise pitch. But 
cranked to the max, the soFware has 
the intriguing (and potentially annoying) 
ability to make people sound like musical 
robots. (You might recognize it from 
Cher’s “Believe,” which was one of the 
ﬁrﬆ hits to make large use of the eﬀeO, 
and nearly all of Kanye Weﬆ’s 808s & 
Heartbreak album was recorded with it.)
Still, it can be fun to tinker with Auto-
Tune, especially if you’re tone-deaf, like 
me. The easiest way to play with the 
eﬀeO: a new iPhone app, appropriately 
called I Am T-Pain. Load up the $3 app, 
sing into your phone’s mic, and the pro-
gram does the reﬆ. 
FC
fun began, with ﬁve of the six phones 
experiencing serious battery or LCD 
problems—the display on a Nokia 
became an unreadable block of blue, 
while bizarre bars polluted another 
phone’s screen. 
Another 10 degrees, down to minus 
40, and all but one of the phones was 
rendered inoperable. The last phone 
ﬆanding, an old Motorola Krzr belong-
ing to a PM ﬆaﬀer, aOually remained 
functional until about minus 55 F, 
when its battery died. 
Remarkably, none of the damage 
appeared to be permanent—all it took 
was a return to room temperature to 
bring all of the phones back to life. 
Still, we’re electronic sadists, and 
we weren’t going to let our access to 
Environ’s environmental teﬆing facility—
and its vats of liquid nitrogen—go to 
waste. Sure, the coldest temperature 
ever recorded on earth was juﬆ minus 
128.6 F (and the continental U.S. has 
never dropped below minus 70) but we 
couldn’t resiﬆ ﬁnding out how our tough-
eﬆ competitor could handle a dunk in a 
minus 314.7 F bucket of liquid nitrogen.
Amazingly, the Motorola phone sur-
vived multiple dips in the coolant.  e 
sub-sub-sub-zero swims caused its 
battery to shut down, but once the 
phone was warmed up, it came back to 
life with no visible damage. We even 
dropped the frozen phone to the ﬂoor 
from hip height. And although we 
expected it to shatter, the fall barely 
caused any damage. In faO, it wasn’t 
until we dunked the Krzr in the liquid 
nitrogen four times, and then forcibly 
threw it to the ground, that it finally 
called it quits. Even then, 
the screen still turned 
on when the phone was 
plugged in (although it 
was unreadable), and, 
amazingly, the audio ﬆill 
worked. Some keys even 
appeared to produce a 
response. 
 e results were reas-
suring, if not aﬆonishing. 
 e bottom line: Alaska 
residents might endure 
some screen problems 
or short-lived batteries 
on cold days, but nothing 
a warm room couldn’t 
cure. And if our phone can handle 
repeated swims in one of the coldeﬆ liq-
uids on earth, yours can surely survive a 
day on the slopes without worry.
Leopard Spots
I want to upgrade my Mac to the new 
Snow Leopard operating syﬆem. Will 
all of my exiﬆing applications be 
compatible with the new OS?
 e new Mac OS X version 10.6, better 
known as Snow Leopard, is a sort of 
guerrilla update. It’s inexpensive (users 
can upgrade to it for as little as $29), and 
does virtually nothing to change the look 
and feel of your computer. In faO, moﬆ 
of its changes are under the hood—it 
uses several gigabytes less hard-drive 
space than its predecessor, and it should 
help your whole syﬆem run a bit faﬆer.
While most existing programs will 
work juﬆ ﬁne on Snow Leopard, a hand-
ful have experienced problems (at leaﬆ in 
their current iterations). When you inﬆall 
Snow Leopard, your computer will auto-
matically move these applications to a 
new folder called Incompatible SoFware.

Though only partially built out, the 
specs for Mueller, a partnership 
between the Catellus Development 
Group and the city of Austin, are 
already impressive. Mueller includes 
the world’s greenest hospital, more 
than 75 acres of parkland and 13 miles 
of bike trails and sidewalks connecting 
550 homes—a quarter of which are 
affordable housing and all of which 
have been built to Austin Energy’s 
green building standards. The master 
plan includes native prairie to seques-
ter carbon, a reclaimed water system 
for irrigation, a town center, a chil-
dren’s museum and housing and 
employment for 10,000 people.
But McCracken sees an even more 
ambitious vision playing out here—
that of a solar-powered “energy Inter-
net.” He is the driving force behind the 
Pecan Street Project, a nonproﬁt dedi-
cated to making Austin a laboratory for 
smart-grid technology. “In the home of 
the future, you will be able to look at an 
app on your phone that tells you what 
your energy usage is, what it’s costing 
you and how it impacts your preset 
electric budget,” McCracken says. 
“You’ll be able to see what individual 
appliances, whether the refrigerator or 
air conditioner, are costing you in real 
time. And you’ll be able to control 
that.” Utilities will be able to take 
advantage of the same software to mea-
sure and manage energy ﬂow.
As a demonstration site for the 
Pecan Street Project (pending federal 
stimulus funding), Mueller would link 
1000 residential meters, 75 commer-
cial meters and plug-in-vehicle- 
charging stations on a microgrid, test-
ing technologies such as energy storage 
as well as business models like rooftop 
solar leasing. “It’s technically challeng-
ing, but so is the Internet, where you 
have millions of computers feeding 
into servers and distributing it out,” 
McCracken says. “The big advantage 
we have is the extent to which this is 
now a technology strategy. We’re a very 
entrepreneurial state. And we have 
some regulatory ﬂexibilities and a busi-
ness culture that’s been really condu-
cive to the high-tech sector.” 
Besides partners like the University 
of Texas and the Environmental 
Defense Fund (EDF), the Pecan Street 
Project has attracted private compa-
nies, including Microsoft, Intel and 
IBM, that will be able to test their own 
technologies in a real-world setting—
without the approval of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. “They 
see smart-grid deployment as some-
thing that is going to go into their mar-
kets, so they really want to ﬁnd out how 
this all works,” John Baker, chief strat-
egy ofﬁcer for Austin Energy, says. 
Austin Energy is municipally owned 
and vertically integrated—its board is 
the city council and its customers are 
its shareholders—so the utility has 
been able to take the long view on alter-
native energy: It has led the Pecan Street 
Project, established the country’s ﬁrst 
green building standards, distributed 
smart meters and pushed auto compa-
nies to develop plug-in vehicles. State 
leadership has not been nearly as pro-
gressive. The legislature meets for only 
140 days every other year. This year, 
despite bipartisan support, only one of 
50 bills with solar incentives passed 
before the session ended; the legisla-
ture meets again in January 2011. 
“I think we’re a little schizophrenic,” 
James Marston, the director of EDF’s 
Texas office, says. “We know wind 
worked and we got some jobs, but we’re 
not as aggressive as Colorado or New 
Mexico or even Michigan [on renewable 
energy], and we’re missing out.”
On that point, Sweetwater’s 
Wortham agrees. “That’s where Texas 
thinks we’re big dogs,” he says. “Tex-
ans do things differently. We’re inde-
pendent and sometimes that gets in 
our way.” When a major wind turbine 
manufacturer considered sites in Texas 
for a factory, Wortham says, the state 
let towns sell themselves. “It’s like The 
Apprentice,” he says. “It slides a little 
package across the way.” Pennsylva-
nia’s governor promoted the entire 
commonwealth as a site and got that 
factory—which led to others.
Last December, before the 2009 state 
legislative session began, I had break-
fast with McCracken and representative 
Strama. McCracken was characteristi-
cally cerebral but optimistic. Gesturing 
over a plate of huevos rancheros, he 
painted a new picture of South Lamar 
Street, which is the heart of South Aus-
tin—“the funky soul of our city.” Instead 
of lube shops, used-car dealers and gas 
stations—businesses serving the exist-
ing energy economy—he described the 
future of South Lamar under a distrib-
uted electrical system, one that will 
open up the economy to green-collar 
jobs and lots of small, local entrants.
“We can totally screw this up,” 
Strama said, kicking back in his chair 
from the heavy wooden table. “The 
energy industry is going to evolve. It 
can either go the way of the evolution 
from radio to television, where the 
existing broadcasters saw change  
coming, invested in it, and led the 
change. Or,” he said, “it can evolve the 
way we went from TV to the Internet, 
where those guys didn’t see change 
coming, and a couple of kids in a 
garage in California built a company 
bigger than all of them.” 
With clean energy poised to become 
the biggest economic opportunity 
since the oil boom, that is what’s at 
stake for Texas. 
FC
“That’s where Texas 
thinks we’re big dogs. 
Texans do things 
differently. We’re inde-
pendent and some-
times that gets 
in our way.”

MAYOR OF SWEETWATER

Daryl Smith didn’t set out to cuﬆom-build radiation dete:ors. 
A=er choosing glass blowing over graduate school, he spent years 
working for pharmaceutical and chemical companies; becoming a glass blower at Yale Univer-
sity allowed him to use his old-fashioned cra= to create ﬆate-of-the-art scientiﬁc tools. Now 
he gets all sorts of requeﬆs: alterations to ﬆandard equipment, designs for prototypes, even 
glass rods for a dete:or that went into CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in Europe. Qe machine 
reveals radiation emitted by charged particles traveling faﬆer than the speed of light—the 
equivalent of traveling backward in time, according to Einﬆein’s theory of relativity. “I tell 
people I’m making a time machine,” Smith says.  — ANDREW MOSEMAN
1. Didymium Goggles  
Smith’s lenses, made from the 
metallic elements praseo-
dymium and neodymium, ﬁlter 
out wavelengths of visible and 
UV light—like yellow sodium 
ﬂare—to help Smith see.
2. Cradle Burner  Smith 
ﬆarts with ordinary glass 
tubes and rods as his raw 
materials, made from the same 
borosilicate glass as ﬆandard 
lab inﬆruments. 9is U-shaped 
series of torches lets him blaﬆ 
heat evenly from six dire:ions. 
3. Lathe  9is lathe allows 
Smith to evenly heat or make 
a clean cut around a tube. 9e 
jaws can also hold a piece 
in place while he melts and 
attaches another to it. 
4. Gas  At 4100 F, a natural 
gas–oxygen ﬂame melts moﬆ 
of the materials Smith uses. 
But if the ﬁnal produ: needs 
to withﬆand very high temper-
atures, he uses tougher pure-
quartz glass and switches to 
a hydrogen–oxygen ﬂame that 
reaches 5250 F.
5. Carbon Forming Tools  
Molten glass won’t ﬆick to 
pure carbon, so the tools 
Smith uses are made of 
graphite, which heats up so 
quickly that it matches the 
temperature of the glass and 
minimizes thermal shock. 
6. Vacuum System  9is 
syﬆem lets Smith conﬁrm that 
a ﬁnished piece is airtight. He 
runs a small Tesla coil over the 
inﬆrument’s surface; if there’s 
a leak, the charge will take the 
path of leaﬆ resiﬆance and 
jump to the hole.
