Introduction 
The idea for an Application Sketch Book is the brainchild of Dean Kaplan 
who understood the app designer’s need for a place to sketch and keep 
their design ideas. He has tailored his concept to the Kindle Fire. 
Knowing that when people design, they work through ideas on 
whiteboards, scrap paper, or even cocktail napkins–only to lose the 
important details later. Kaplan created this sketch book to capture these 
ideas and help envision them on the appropriate smart devices. 
 
The idea is simple. Give the user pages of grid space to draw and  layout 
their plans, sketches, and ideas for Kindle Fire applications. Additionally, 
users have found a number of unexpected uses for the book. 
 
The book provides: 
• A grid background on each page.  
• A binding that allows you to have one hand on your Kindle Fire and 
one on a pencil. 
• Over 150 pages to write, draw, compose or doodle. 
• An organized place for your user interface designs. 
 
The Kindle Fire Application Sketch Book has been created with the 
smartphone application designers in mind. We hope that you will find 
this book useful for whatever purpose you choose.
