Organizing 
Your Life

No one likes a know-it-all. Most of us realize there’s no such thing—
how could there be? The world is far too complicated for someone 
to understand everything there is to know. So when you come across 
a know-it-all, you smile to yourself as they ramble on because you 
know better.
You understand that the quest for knowledge is a never-ending one, 
and you’re okay with that. You have no desire to know everything, just 
the next thing. You know what you don’t know, you’re confident enough 
to admit it, and you’re motivated to do something about it.
At Idiot’s Guides, we, too, know what we don’t know, and we make 
it our business to find out. We find really smart people who are 
experts in their fields and then we roll up our sleeves and get to work, 
asking lots of questions and thinking long and hard about how best 
to pass along their knowledge to you in the easiest, most-accessible 
way possible.
After all, that’s our promise—to make whatever you want to learn “As 
Easy as It Gets.” That means giving you a well-organized design that 
seamlessly and effortlessly guides you from page to page, topic to topic. 
It means controlling the pace you’re asked to absorb new information—
not too much at once but just what you need to know right now. It 
means giving you a clear progression from easy to more difficult. It 
means giving you more instructional steps wherever necessary to really 
explain the details. And it means giving you fewer words and more 
illustrations wherever it’s better to show rather than tell.
So here you are, at the start of something new. The next chapter in 
your quest. It can be an intimidating place to be, but you’ve been here 
before and so have we. Clear your mind and turn the page. By the end 
of this book, you won’t be a know-it-all, but your world will be a little 
less complicated than it was before. And we’ll be sure your journey is 
as easy as it gets.

IDIOT’S GUIDES: ORGANIZING YOUR LIFE

INTRODUCTION
Over the years, I’ve found that traditional ways of organizing don’t work for everyone. With busy 
families, lots of hobbies and extracurricular activities, and often very little storage space, it’s no wonder 
we struggle to try to create a sense of order and organization in our homes and lives. I’ve read almost 
every organizing book and magazine and incorporated so many of the ideas within them into my home. 
I’ve bought all the expensive organizational pieces. Yet for so long, an organizing solution that really 
worked for me and my family eluded me.
I got so frustrated I couldn’t get my home and family organized, I ﬁnally had a realization. It occurred to 
me that I was working against myself by buying storage pieces that were forcing me to put things away 
in a very neat and tidy way. I can admit: as a family, we’re not neat and tidy people all the time. We ﬁnd 
ourselves tossing items quickly as we put them away, so bins and baskets out in the open—not storage 
pieces in which everything has to be neatly tucked away in its speciﬁc place—are better for us.
It’s never been in my nature to put things away in an overly neat way. Add my busy family, with very 
little free time to put things away in an overly orderly fashion, and it’s easy to see how organization 
methods that don’t really work for us fail when we get busy.
Traditional, mainstream organizing systems tend to be designed for people who are good about putting 
things away neatly in tidy organizational pieces. Think about it: isn’t that what the “after” photos often 
look like in organizing magazines and on storage solution websites? These might be the ideal for some, 
but they’re not necessarily the solution for everyone.
I’ve found that there are myriad effective ways you can organize “out in the open,” without having to 
neatly tuck things away using pretty pieces and creative strategies to ﬁnally get organized. As you look 
through this book, you’ll see a common theme: most of the concepts are designed for realistic, out-in-
the-open organizing opportunities that still look beautiful and provide a sense of order.
Instead of focusing on trying to force yourself into becoming a neater person who can use all the neat 
and tidy organizing ideas that look nice and mimic the popular magazines and websites, allow yourself 
to organize your home and life by focusing on how you naturally put things away. This has worked for 
my family. I hope it works for yours, too.
I hope I’ve inspired you to think differently when it comes to your stuff, your storage, and your 
organization and to discover the solution that ﬁnally works best for you.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Thank you to my wonderful team at Alpha Books for all your work helping make this book the best it 
can be: my editors, Billy Fields and Christy Wagner, and designer, Rebecca Batchelor. Thank you to 
my amazing husband, Pat, and our beautiful daughter, Bella, for your love, patience, encouragement, 
and understanding throughout this book writing process. I know it wasn’t easy, and I cannot thank the 
two of you enough for being so understanding. I am so grateful and thankful each day for your love. 
Thank you to my family for all your love and support—and yes, Mom, thank you for taking dictation for 
me on long drives. To my second family, the Shepherds, thank you from the bottom of my heart for all 
your support, dinners, laughter, and help with my crazy projects. Thank you so much to my dear friend, 
Amanda Carol Eck, for helping me talk through so many details when it came to this project. Your 
friendship has meant the world to me in so many ways. Thank you to my friends for your tremendous 
support and encouragement, and a very special thank you to my best friend, Sharon Hunter, for always 
cheering me on, talking me down from ledges, and being the best listener I have ever known. A very 
big thank you to all my favorite bloggers and designers who so graciously agreed to share a project (or 
two) in this book. Each of you has given me so much creative inspiration over the years, and I could 
not imagine doing this project without including the people who inspire me! Thank you so much 
ladies! Thank you to my contractor, Jesús Terrazas, for helping me through countless projects and 
brainstorming with me through all my ideas. Thank you to my readers of The Creativity Exchange. You 
have brought me so much joy and encouragement over the years. I thank each and every one of you for 
your support. I hope more than anything that through this book, you will see that organizing your life is 
very doable and doesn’t have to be complicated. I hope that through this book and the projects shared, 
you, too, can ﬁnd long-term solutions for getting and staying organized.

encourage you to visit all the websites of all the contributors shown throughout for more 
ideas and inspiration.


GETTING 
STARTED
Are you ready to organize your life? If you picked up 
this book, that’s a sign you’re at least thinking about it, 
if you’re not completely ready to jump in just yet. But 
even if you are ready to jump, sometimes the thought 
of getting your house and your life in order still feels 
so overwhelming. Where do you begin? How do you 
get started? How do you go about tackling all the areas 
of your life and home that need to be organized? That 
intimidating and overwhelming feeling you might be 
experiencing right now is the primary reason why so 
many people give up on getting organized before they 
even get started. But you don’t have to be among them.
You can get organized. You can have a home that’s 
orderly and organized. You can get your life on track. 
You just need some help, and that’s what this book pro-
vides. In these ﬁrst pages, you learn how to change the 
way you think about organizing; look at why you might 
not have succeeded at past attempts at organization; 
and begin to think differently about your stuff, your 
home, and your life.

RETHINK ORGANIZING
GETTING STARTED

We all have unique ideas of what “being orga-
nized” means—your deﬁnition is probably dif-
ferent from mine, and neither of our notions is 
exactly like our friends’, our neighbors’, etc. And 
that’s okay! We all approach organization and 
order differently.
Maybe you’ve tried to get organized in the past 
but soon fell back into your unorganized ways. 
Maybe you ﬁnally got your bedroom closet in 
order but ran out of energy after tackling that 
time-consuming project and didn’t make it to the 
rest of your home. Or maybe you walked into your 
spare room, garage, or basement; saw the piles 
and stacks of stuff; and gave up before you even 
began to make some sense of the mess. Whatever 
you might have done in the past, that’s in the  
past. Now you have an opportunity to make a 
clean start.
First things ﬁrst, know that you don’t have to live 
up to those perhaps-unrealistic visions of organiz-
ing perfection from pretty magazines that show 
everything in its place, or those equally gorgeous 
organizing websites that can serve as inspiration 
… but also intimidation. It’s wonderful that those 
images inspire you, that they make you want to 
make some changes in your home and your life, 
that they make you want to ﬁnally tackle your  
lack of organization. That’s what they’re supposed 
to do.
But your home and your life are your home and 
your life. Neither must exactly match what those 
organizing experts have done—and probably have 
done with a large budget and styling professionals 
to help make everything magazine photo–worthy. 
Your version of being organized should be what 
works best for you, your family, your home, and 
your life.
The most important thing right now is to throw 
out any and all preconceived ideas and unrealistic 
expectations you might hold of what getting or-
ganized means to someone else, and with a clear, 
objective, unbiased view, pinpoint the trouble 
spots and areas in your home and life that slow 
you down. Once you can honestly identify these 
areas, you are better equipped to ﬁnd and create 
long-term solutions you can stick with.
What those solutions are for you, you have to de-
termine. (But don’t worry, this book can help!) The 
key is to think differently, to approach the idea 
of getting organized without those past thoughts 
and memories of failure to weigh you down and 
make you discouraged. You can do this. You can 
get your home in order, whether that’s a one-room 
studio apartment or a six-bedroom home in the 
suburbs. Almost all the ideas and tips in this book 
can be applied to whatever size home you have if 
you get creative and use what works best for you.
You can get your life under control. You can get 
organized!

You don’t need any special tools or 
knowledge to get organized. Sure, some 
baskets, bins, racks, etc. can help you 
WLG\XS\RXUVWXIIDQGƂQGKRPHV
for formerly homeless items, but you 
probably have much of what you need 
already that can be repurposed into 
new roles. By reusing what you have, you 
can corral your clutter without bringing 
yet more stuff into your space.

NARROW YOUR FOCUS
GETTING STARTED

The busier your life gets, chances are, the more 
you long for some sense of order and organization. 
We all get to that point from time to time. It’s a 
natural part of being human and dealing with all 
the “stuff” that accumulates around us.
In fact, you’ve probably sat down at some point 
when you felt the most unorganized and compiled 
a long list of all the areas in your home and life 
that need to be organized. (My editor is nodding 
her head as she reads this, thinking of how many 
extensive to-do lists she has at any one time.)
This “long list” approach, of writing down the 
often-overwhelming number of areas that need to 
be ﬁxed, is the biggest reason why so many of us 
fail at organizing before we even get started. Few 
things are more intimidating and daunting than 
staring at that huge list and thinking about what 
needs to be done.
So don’t do that. Instead of trying to organize 
multiple areas at one time, narrow your focus. 
Instead of thinking of all the problem areas in 
your life, work on resolving one issue at a time. 
If you focus on your number-one problem, you 
can channel more of your time and energy into 
not only organizing that area but also ultimately 
creating a long-term solution you can maintain.
WHAT’S YOUR NUMBER-ONE PROBLEM?
As you begin to think about organizing one 
problem area at a time, determine where the 
greatest source of frustration and disarray is in 
your home or life. In what area of your home, for 
example, do you waste the most time, or what 
rooms or spots do you seem to be organizing 
over and over? It might help to ask yourself, If 
I could just organize one area in my home, what 
would that area be? Chances are, you’ll be able 
to answer that question instantly. If you can’t, 
ask for assistance in identifying problem areas. 
Query your spouse and other family members on 
what they feel are the greatest organizational 
problem spots in your home. Including the 
family in your quest for order and organization 
is critical because you can’t implement real, 
lasting solutions without their help. If you’re 
VWLOOIHHOLQJRYHUZKHOPHGDQGKDYLQJGLIƂFXOW\
pinpointing your primary problem, you can 
compile a short list—emphasis on shortuRIƂYH
of your greatest trouble spots. Then, prioritize 
\RXUVKRUWOLVWRIƂYHWREHWWHUDVVHVV\RXUPDLQ
problem area.

NARROW YOUR FOCUS
7
The added beneﬁt of focusing on one problem 
at a time is that there’s often a chain-reaction 
effect. If you create a solution for one problem, 
you most likely will resolve other problems and 
address trouble spots, too, even if inadvertently. 
For instance, say all your craft supplies are stored 
in your laundry room cabinets. If you create a 
dedicated storage area for your crafting supplies 
somewhere else in your home—in your office 
bookshelves or your guest bedroom closet, for 
example—you simultaneously create new storage 
space in your laundry room. When you move your 
detergents, cleaners, and other laundry supplies 
into their rightful place in the laundry room 
cabinets, you free up space elsewhere in your 
home for other items to move into.
And notice those words create a solution. If you’re 
constantly organizing a trouble spot, you’re only 
providing a temporary ﬁx. Instead, you need 
to create a solution that resolves the need for 
repeated organizing. Often, such cases are caused 
by a lack of something. For instance, does the area 
need an extra shelf or a unique storage piece to 
house stray items? Look for ways to go beyond 
simply organizing by determining what’s needed 
and creating a long-term resolution.
By narrowing your focus to resolving one problem 
at a time and eliminating the overwhelming long 
list, you also allow yourself a victory one project at 
a time. All those small victories add up and give 
you the conﬁdence and encouragement you need 
to tackle the next challenge.

The right solution for a trouble spot might 
not necessarily be a traditional item used for 
organizing. Remember, you don’t need any 
speciﬁc or special tools or equipment to get 
your home and life organized—although you’re 
certainly welcome to purchase bookshelves or 
matching bins or baskets to house your unruly 
stuff if that’s what works best for you. However, if 
you solely rely on such traditional organizational 
pieces and hope they solve your problem areas, 
you limit your chances of ﬁnding the perfect 
solution for your unique issues.
Your organizational challenges are unique to your 
home, and one-size-ﬁts-all organizational pieces 
are not guaranteed to resolve your trouble spots. 
Rather, the perfect solution could be that old 
dresser taking up space in your garage or a stack 
of garden pots your spouse was about to toss in 
the garage.
If you can look at your storage pieces, furniture, 
and accessories with an unbiased view of what 
they have been and instead focus on what 
they could be, if you can learn to think of them 
as prospective solutions to your organizing 
challenges, you can begin to think differently 
about organizing. That’s how you ﬁnd your 
creative solutions. If you train yourself to look 
ﬁrst at the pieces you have already, you have the 
potential of doubling your efforts by ﬁxing an 
unorganized trouble spot and creating additional 
storage space by using a piece that was taking up 
space elsewhere.
Oftentimes, the solution to an organization 
challenge seems a lot more complicated than what 
it really is. Many solutions are possible simply 
by tapping into your creativity and through do-
it-yourself (DIY) projects. If you create your own 
solutions, you can customize them to maximize 
your speciﬁc space and address your home’s 
unique areas. Plus, by reusing something you 
already have, you eliminate the need to buy more 
stuff and save money.
If you can change how you think about organizing, 
you can eliminate any preconceived notions 
you might have and learn to create real, long-
term solutions. Instead of organizing something 
over and over, you can focus on ﬁnding unique 
solutions to resolve your home’s and your life’s 
unique, underlying problems. The result will be 
not only getting organized, but staying organized.

For too long we have been taught to 
hide and neatly tuck away clutter. 
However, for a busy family, the 
chances of keeping everything 
tidy behind closed doors is next to 
impossible. Instead, if you creatively 
incorporate storage solutions into 
your décor and out in the open, in 
every room of your home, you stand 
a better chance of getting—and most 
importantly, staying—organized. 
By placing creative storage 
solutions front and center, you and 
everyone in your family can see and 
understand where things go, where to 
return items when they’re done using 
them, and where to go to look for 
something the next time.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
GETTING STARTED
10
This book was designed to be a workbook you 
can use to get each area of your home and life 
organized and in order. Throughout are myriad 
tips, tricks, tools, and shortcuts to walk you 
through the organizing process, step by step, 
room by room, project by project.
At the beginning of each new section is an 
introduction to that room or area of the home, 
with notes on the key elements and points to 
ponder when it comes to organizing that space.
Then the fun begins. Using hundreds of photos, 
we show you fresh and fun ways to get organized. 
Throughout, I’ve tried to highlight some of the 
more creative options I’ve found to inspire you 
to think of unique solutions that might work for 
you, your home, and your organizational style. 
Although some of what’s shown throughout 
these pages might not work for you, I hope they 
encourage you to look at your situation differently 
to see what other opportunities you can come up 
with that work in your space.
We’ve also included printable labels, worksheets, 
lists, and other items throughout the book to  
help you get—and stay—organized.  
These are available—for free—at 
thecreativityexchange.com/ 
organizing-your-life.
At the end of each section, a handy checklist 
recaps important tips, offers links you can visit 
online for more organizing inspiration, and 
provides an area where you can jot down notes 
and things you want to try.
I’m a big fan of do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, 
especially those that help me control clutter, 
maximize the space I have to work with, and ﬁnd 
a unique solution to a storage or organizational 
problem. I’ve shared several of my favorite DIY 
projects throughout the book. Some of these you 
can implement in your home as is; some you 
might need to adapt to ﬁt your speciﬁc space. 
At the very least, I hope they show you that you 
don’t have to be a professional organizer or 
an experienced contractor to create long-term 
solutions to the organizational challenges you 
face.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
11
You don’t need a lot of tools or specialized 
equipment to get organized, but I’ve found that 
some items are especially handy:
• A tape measure that ﬁts on your key chain 
is one of my favorite things. When I’m out 
shopping for storage and organizational 
pieces, this is almost always with me and I 
can quickly check to ensure something will 
work in and ﬁt my space.
• Sticky notes, stuck on the pages of this 
book or others, can help you keep track of 
your favorite ideas.
• A camera, on your phone or a standalone 
digital camera, comes in handy for taking 
shots of the room or space you’re organizing 
so you can refer to it while you’re out shop-
ping for storage pieces. Or you can snap 
quick photos of potential storage pieces 
while you’re out shopping to see how they’d 
look in your space.
I like bookmarks. They mark my page when 
,pPUHDGLQJQRYHOVWKH\ƃDJVRPHWKLQJ
I want to come back to later, and they 
encourage me to focus on only one problem 
at a time. To that end, I’ve created a 
bookmark for use with this book. If 
you slide it in the section of the book 
that corresponds to your number-one 
organizational issue, it can help remind 
you not to get off track or overwhelmed 
by the other areas in your home that need 
organizing. And the tips on the bookmark 
are the key elements to think about and 
ask yourself as you begin to think about 
organizing a room. To use the printable, go

ENTRYWAY 
AND EXITS
Entryways especially but also exits are prime 
dumping ground for clutter as people come 
into, and go out of, your home. These areas are 
also easy spots in which to corral the clutter—
the coats, backpacks, bags, hats, shoes, keys, 
and all the other little things found here— 
before it enters your home. If you can create 
good storage solutions right inside the door, 
you can prevent these items from cluttering 
other areas of your home.
In this section, you learn that even in the small-
est and narrowest of spaces, you can implement 
easy and creative storage opportunities in the 
entryway and exits. The key is utilizing walls 
and other commonly wasted areas.

DO IT YOURSELF
Easy Coat Wall
DIY PROJECT #1
First I attached bead board paneling, turned 
horizontally for a more modern look, with 
ﬁnishing nails down each groove and stud 
line. On the top and bottom of the paneling, 
I installed 1´2-inch (2.5´cm) boards as shelf 
braces, nailing them to the paneling rather 
than the wall to help secure the paneling.
MATERIALS
If you have a narrow entryway, you might not think you have room to get this area organized. 
But you can! This 3 foot, 6 inch (1m)–wide hallway is right by the back door—the perfect spot 
to hang jackets, backpacks, hats, and baskets for little things like scarves, mittens, travel bags, 
headphones, etc. 
TOOLS
Using a doorframe as a guide, I designed the 
coat wall to be just about 51⁄2 inches (14cm) 
deep to get the most storage and organization 
without impeding the walkway. (Before you get 
started with the installation, be sure to locate 
and mark the studs in your wall!)

EASY COAT WALL
Next, I added the top shelf, which was a 1´6-inch 
(2.5´15cm) board, setting it ﬂush to the wall and nailing 
into the 1´2-inch (2.5´5cm) shelf braces at the top and 
bottom of the paneling. I added a second shelf at the 
bottom of the paneling. I then installed a third shelf, 
braced with another 1´2-inch (2.5´5cm) board, centered 
between the top shelf and the ceiling and a fourth shelf 
centered between the bottom shelf and the ﬂoor.
Using 1´6-inch (2.5´15cm) boards again, I added the 
sides from the ﬂoor to the ceiling, nailing the sides into 
the shelves. At the ﬂoor, I cut and rounded the 1´6-inch 
(2.5´15cm) board to ﬁt over the baseboard.
I caulked all the edges, shelves, and 1´2-inch (2.5´5cm) 
braces and painted everything with a primer after the 
caulk dried. I ﬁnished with an oil-based paint in a matte 
ﬁnish.
After the paint was dry, I added six coat/hat hooks 
across the top of the paneling, secured into the studs 
for extra strength, and installed seven smaller hooks to 
the underside of the top shelf. Then I ﬁlled the wall with 
baskets, buckets, and other storage pieces. 
This is one area that gets lots of usage! For more

QUICK TRICKS

TRICK #1  
SPRAY PAINT WIRE BASKETS 
TO MATCH YOUR DÉCOR
Can’t ﬁnd wire baskets to match your entryway 
décor? That’s not a problem with this quick 
trick.  Simply use spray primer and paint to 
change the color of mismatched wire storage 
baskets.
Prepare the baskets with a thin coat of spray 
primer, and allow it to dry. Then spray two thin 
coats of paint in your desired color, allowing 
the paint to dry in between coats.
Be sure to check out clearance sections for 
unpopular colors and great deals you can 
make over!

QUICK TRICKS
TRICK #2 
COVER A COAT RACK WITH 
WALLPAPER
Coat hooks can be rather boring and blah. But 
you can easily dress up your coat or hat rack 
into something chic and pretty!
All you need to do is cover a piece of plywood, 
cut to your desired dimensions, with wallpaper 
before adding the hooks. If your wallpaper is 
self-pasting, simply dip it in water to activate 
the paste and smoothly cover the board. If 
your wallpaper does not have paste, use a 
wide paintbrush to apply a coat of wallpaper 
paste to the top and sides of the board and 
then adhere the paper and use a credit card to 
smooth out any air bubbles. Pull the wallpaper 
tight to the back side of the board, and secure 
with nails or staples. Let the wallpaper dry for 
a bit before adding the hooks, and secure the 
ﬁnished piece to the wall with toggle bolts so 
it’s extra secure.

27
• Walls are the perfect place to install 
hooks for coats, bags, backpacks, hats, 
scarves, etc.
• Do you have an entryway table? 
What’s under it? If nothing currently 
resides there, add a large basket to 
corral items such as shoes.
• Don’t forget the corners! Use that 
overlooked area for narrow umbrella 
holders or coat racks.
• Pretty baskets on entryway tables are 
perfect for storing mail.
• Small decorative trays on tabletops 
can be both pretty and functional for 
corralling keys, change, and smaller 
items.
• Bins and larger baskets are a great way 
to store magazines and books that are 
dropped here.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look for 
items that tend to pile up around the 
entryway and exits to determine what 
items need a ﬁx. If shoes are a prob-
lem, wrangle them with a large basket 
or a bench with built-in shoe storage. 
If magazines, mail, and other little 
things tend to litter the entryway table, 
place a large basket on the table and 
encourage your family to toss all those 
little things in it.
• A fresh coat of paint can transform an 
old dresser into a great entryway table-
top. As a bonus, the drawers can serve 
as additional storage.
• An old coat rack spray painted in a 
bright and bold color is a fun way to 
add a pop of color—and more storage.
tips


KITCHEN
It’s all too easy to have more kitchen tools, 
gadgets, and equipment than the drawer and 
cabinet space required to hold all those items. 
Therefore, maximizing all your potential kitch-
en space and sorting out duplicate items is 
essential for getting—and staying—organized in 
the kitchen.
Oftentimes, items are housed in the kitchen 
that aren’t necessarily used in there—or aren’t 
used often enough to warrant keeping them 
there. Floral vases, entertaining items, and 
large serving pieces only occasionally brought 
out and used can be stored in other areas of the 
home. Look to the dining room, storage cabi-
nets in other rooms, and even closets to hold 
these items instead. Identifying and relocat-
ing those seldom-used items taking up space 
in your kitchen means more storage space for 
those pieces you do use often.

CANISTERS
Canisters should be a staple in any 
kitchen. Countless varieties are avail-
able, and they provide a simple solution 
for storing coffee, sugar, ﬂour, etc. 
GARDEN PLANTERS
A small garden planter provides a 
decorative piece in which to store soaps, 
scrubbing pads, etc. 
SMALL BASKETS
Cooking oils and sprays can be neatly 
organized in a small basket with handles 
close to your oven. The handles make it 
easy to move your supplies around the 
kitchen when needed. 
FLAT BASKETS OR TRAYS
Large, ﬂat baskets or trays are handy 
for catching little stuff often tossed on 
the counter. When you need the counter 
space, you can quickly and easily remove 
the tray.
33

CABINET STORAGE
CABINETS
Turn a kitchen cabinet into a decorative open 
storage cabinet for pretty pieces such as elegant 
glassware and crystal. This is especially handy for 
use when entertaining. Save time and space by 
setting up a drink area directly below the cabinet, 
and guests can grab their own glasses. Simply 
remove hinges, calk the holes, and paint.
TIERED SERVING STANDS
Use multitiered serving stands to store rarely used 
holiday china or dishes vertically, in a small amount 
of space, in cabinets. (You might need to adjust short 
shelves if your stand is tall.) Then, when you need 
a piece or two, you can access them quickly. These 
stands also can be used to hold hors d’oeuvre or serv-
ing dishes on the table when entertaining, leaving 
more room on the tabletop for your guests’ dishes.

Printable Baking Labels
DIY PROJECT #2
MATERIALS
By organizing your baking ingredients, spices, and accessories together in one cabinet, you 
create a quick and easy baking station—which might encourage you to bake more! These fun 
and functional printable labels enable you to personalize all your baking supplies.
TOOLS
I’ve designed a few different sizes of labels to ﬁt various-volume canisters. I’ve included bigger 
labels for those ingredients like ﬂour and sugar you might store in larger quantities and, there-
fore, use larger containers. Other labels are smaller to ﬁt those jars and canisters that hold less of 
an item.
All you need for these pretty printable labels is 81⁄2´11-inch (21.5´28cm) sheets of label paper, 
your printer, a pen or marker, and scissors. I opted for 3M label paper with removable adhesive so 
I can take off the labels later if I want.
To use the printables, go to thecreativityexchange.com/organizing-your-life, and download the 
blank label template. Either print the blank labels on 81⁄2´11-inch (21.5´28cm) label paper and 
write on them with a pen or marker, or ﬁll in the labels on your computer using image-editing 
software and then print. Adhere the labels to your containers.
These lovely labels will make you smile each time you open your organized cabinet—and inspire 
you to keep it orderly! For more how-to information and inspirational photos, visit thecreativity-

SPECIALIZED ORGANIZERS
Creating specialized drawers for housing serving 
utensils and entertaining pieces you don’t use 
frequently frees up space in your more-often-used 
silverware and utensil drawers. Then, when you’re 
entertaining, all your serving pieces are easy to 
ﬁnd in one place.
DEEP UTENSIL ORGANIZERS
Choose kitchen utensil organizers that are deep to 
hold the most implements. (Some utensil/silverware 
organizers are very shallow and waste a lot of space.) 
If you look for deeper drawer organizers, you can 
store almost double the number of items in a drawer.
Opt for all-in-one measuring pieces that offer multi-
ple measurement options to eliminate the need for 
several bulky measuring pieces.

TRICK #1  
CREATE A KITCHEN COMMAND CENTER
An easy way to keep your kitchen counters free of the clutter they tend to accumulate is to turn a cabinet into a hid-
den kitchen command center. By creating a mini-office in a kitchen cabinet, you can group all your office supplies and 
daily-use items in one easy-to-access spot, off the counter and tucked away behind closed doors. Use drawer organiz-
ers to hold paper, note cards, and envelopes in the front, and stack office trays in the back to hold notebooks, phone 
books, and other larger items. Adhere corkboard to the insides of the doors for to pin up notes, to-do lists, invitations, 
and more.

TRICK #2 
Cookie tins are often exchanged during the 
holidays, ﬁlled with cookies, candies, and other 
treats. But after the holidays, you’re left with a 
bunch of random, mismatched tins. Repurpose 
these tins into pretty, coordinated storage 
pieces with a little spray paint. First spray your 
tins with a thin coat of spray primer and allow 
to completely dry. Next, moving quickly and 
from a distance of at least 2 feet (.5m) away, 
spray on a thin coat of your desired color 
paint, just enough to completely cover the tin. 
Allow the paint to dry overnight before putting 
on the lid.

tips
• The back sides of cabinet doors are 
ideal for holding hooks, over-the-door 
baskets, or hanging spice racks.
• Maximize drawer space by buying 
deep and expandable utensil organiz-
ers that ﬁt the entire width and depth 
of your drawers.
• Blank kitchen walls can house ﬂoor-to-
ceiling furniture such as a bookshelf 
that creates additional kitchen storage 
for serving pieces, cookbooks, and 
more.
• Free up additional pantry space by 
pulling out your baking ingredients 
and spices separately in a nearby 
cabinet.
• Use a plastic tub to hold duplicates 
of cooking utensils and rarely used 
gadgets, and store them in a cabinet to 
unclutter your utensil drawer.
• Use baskets or plastic tubs to stack 
muffin and cake pans vertically so you 
can grab the pan you need quickly and 
easily.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look at cab-
inets that give you the most problems 
and determine if you need to remove 
items and come up with creative stor-
age solutions within the cabinets. For 
instance, if your cookie sheet/baking 
pan cabinet is always a mess, con-
sider removing a shelf to stack items 
vertically to keep the cabinet in order. 
If your problem cabinet is the pots and 
pans cabinet, consider incorporating 
shoe shelving for additional organiza-
tion.
• Transform an old china cabinet, hutch, 
or bookshelf into a beautiful open stor-
age piece in your kitchen by removing 
the upper doors and updating it with a 
fresh coat of paint.
• Use extra baskets and plastic storage 
tubs and bins in the pantry to separate 
and organize ingredients and supplies.


DINING 
ROOM
The dining room can be one of the least- 
often used rooms in your home, with the least 
amount of furniture, which makes it perfect for 
creating additional organized storage. With 
all the multipurpose storage furniture piec-
es available today, you can really get creative 
when choosing storage in the dining room. For 
example, a console or sofa table can be used as 
a food buffet and still allow for hidden storage 
below.
In this section, you see that the dining room  
is the perfect space in which to organize  
seldom-used kitchen items such as large serv-
ing and entertaining pieces, holiday dishes, and 
surplus dishes and glassware. But storage here 
isn’t limited to kitchen items. Use the organiz-
ing opportunities in the dining room for any-
thing you need.

FURNITURE WITH DRAWERS
Look for furniture pieces that can do double-duty 
with drawer space on top and open storage below 
for deep baskets. Tuck in extra dinnerware, linens, 
or larger serving pieces in these hidden-away spots.
HIDDEN CABINET/BUFFET STORAGE
A cabinet is a great way to store china and glass-
ware. You also can make use of the top of the cabi-
net to for pretty storage and décor.

DRESSER/CONSOLE TABLE
An old dresser (minus a drawer or two) in the 
dining room can make a great bar or tabletop. 
Drawers add much-needed storage for items  
ranging from plates to games.

OPEN SHELVING PIECES 
Opening shelving can be used to hold baskets and 
decorative storage pieces out in the open. And 
when you’re entertaining, you can serve food or 
drinks from these pieces, making more room on 
your tabletop or in your kitchen for other items.

Inexpensive premade shoe shelving units meant for closets 
can create an additional layer of shelving in larger cabinets,

STACK DISHES
Maximize space in the buffet (or even in 
your kitchen cabinets) by grouping and

Hidden-Storage Buffet
DIY PROJECT #3
I built the frame using sheets of 1-inch 
(2.5cm) thick plywood cut to 15´343⁄4 inches 
(38´88.25cm) for the two sides and 15´831⁄2 
inches (38´212cm) for the bottom and middle 
shelves. Assembly was quick and easy using 
nails.
I added a 1´6-inch (2.5´15cm) board under the 
middle of the bottom shelf for reinforcement.
MATERIALS
The dining room often presents a unique challenge. Usually, so much of the room is taken up 
by the table and chairs, even when they’re not in use, not much space is left for other furniture. 
Add guests around your table, and your room shrinks even more. But having a place to store 
your good china or larger or less frequently used serving dishes in this room is helpful—and 
frees up space in your kitchen. This DIY buffet is only 16 inches (40.5cm) wide, doesn’t interfere 
with the walking space around the table, and provides lots of hidden storage.
TOOLS
If you attempt this project, be sure you use extra-sturdy materials that will hold up to the weight of your 
dishes and not buckle or break.

HIDDEN-STORAGE BUFFET 
Then I cut two 15´15-inch (38´38cm) pieces and attached 
them between each shelf, in the center, for reinforcement 
as well as two more reinforcement 1´6-inch (2.5´15cm) 
boards evenly spaced under the bottom shelf. 
I cut the top of the buffet to 15´851⁄2 (38´217cm)—2 inch-
es (5cm) longer than the shelves because it ﬁt over the 
tops of the side pieces. I cut another piece 1´33⁄4 inches 
(2.5´9.5cm) and added it to the front bottom base to hide 
the reinforcements there.
I set the buffet in the dining room and trimmed the front 
edges and the center support with 1´3-inch (2.5´7.5cm) 
boards.
I cut the 205⁄8´311⁄4-inch (52.5´79.25cm) doors from a 
sheet of MDF so they wouldn’t warp and attached them 
to the buffet with hinges. I added a thin piece of 1⁄2-inch 
(1.25cm) trim, rounded on one edge, to ﬁnish the end of 
the buffet. I then caulked and painted the piece.
I’m so excited to have this buffet in my dining room to hold all my china and serving pieces—and also have a long 
surface to use when I entertain. You could make your own buffet a different size depending on how much space  
you have to work with and your organizational needs. For more how-to information and inspirational photos, visit

TOP SHELF 
Make the most of this area to hold  
often-used items, serve as your 
drink-mixing sufrace, showcase your 
decorative glassware, and free up  
valuable kitchen cabinet space.
GLASSWARE BASKET
Rather than storing glassware plainly 
on the shelf, add a pretty basket to keep 
stem ware and other glasses orga-
nized. (This also helps you carry these 
breakable items to and from the kitchen 
during cleanup.)
STORAGE CONTAINERS
Opt for fun and colorful baskets, bins, and

tips
• Blank walls or corners are perfect for 
closed cabinet storage furniture pieces 
that can be used to hold virtually 
anything.
• Install inexpensive ﬂoating shelves to 
create additional on-the-wall storage 
for pretty glassware, serving pieces, 
and china.
• Upholstered storage benches are great 
dining room dual-purpose pieces. 
They offer both seating and organiz-
ing opportunities.
• Use baskets or decorative bins on open 
shelving to store linens, extra dishes, 
or serving pieces.
• Make ample use of stackable bins to 
contain the little stuff inside closed 
storage furniture.
• Small console tables or tiered bar/bev-
erage carts are ideal for organizing bar 
accessories and glassware. As a bonus, 
they can serve as a beverage serving 
area when you’re entertaining.
• Assess your trouble spots. Take a close 
look at what clutter frequently tends to 
end up in the dining room and on the 
dining room table speciﬁcally. If your 
table is cluttered with mail, bags, keys, 
and other small items, consider creat-
ing storage solutions in your entryway 
to corral these things. For other clutter, 
place a large tray or basket on the ta-
ble to catch stray items. You can then 
grab the tray or basket and quickly and 
easily take it away to clear the table.
• Use an old dresser as a buffet on the 
top, and utilize the drawers below for 
storage. Line the drawers with felt, and 
house old china, silver, and antique 
serving pieces inside.
• Dress up traditional narrow book-
shelves for the dining room by attach-
ing two together and adding molding 
around the edges.


LIVING AND 
FAMILY ROOMS
The living room or family room is often the 
most used space in the home. By incorporating 
storage pieces such as baskets, bins, and trays 
out in the open, rather than closed away where 
they can be easily forgotten, you increase the 
chances of keeping this space organized.
But don’t rule out closed storage pieces alto-
gether. Another key to getting—and keeping—
the living room/family room organized is to 
choose furniture pieces that allow for addition-
al storage. Today, you can ﬁnd many kinds of 
stylish yet functional furniture options. Choos-
ing these pieces—and implementing open stor-
age as well—can make a major impact on orga-
nization in these busy rooms.

DIY PROJECT #4
MATERIALS
TOOLS
Almost any type of furniture can help you get a room organized, but imagine designing and 
building your own personalized pieces to hold exactly what you want them to hold! With 
a little creativity, an afternoon or more of labor, and some inexpensive materials, you can 
craft a custom wall bookshelf or entertainment center to ﬁt just about whatever space you 
have available.
Before you get started with the installation, be sure to locate and mark the studs 
in your wall.
The key to this project is planning. You need to carefully evaluate your space and just as carefully 
design what you want your bookshelves or entertainment center to look like.
For example, if you base your design on using standard, 12-inch (30cm) shelving boards, you can 
lower both labor and costs because you don’t have to cut the wood narrower. And to save even 
more money, consider using the wall upon which you’re building your shelves as the backing of 
the cabinets instead of using more wood there. You can either leave the wall the original paint 
color or paint it the same color as the shelving unit.
After you’ve designed your bookshelf or entertainment center, cut your boards to the required 
lengths speciﬁed in your design. Then begin installation. It’s easiest to assemble your shelves 
on the ﬂoor ﬁrst and then attach the whole frame to the wall, being sure to screw into studs for 
strength and support.

then secure the shelves to the support by screwing down

tips
• Choose furniture pieces that create the 
maximum amount of storage for an 
area. A tall bookshelf can provide two 
or three times as much storage as a 
small table or chest in the same area.
• Add a narrow sofa table with top and 
bottom shelving behind the sofa for 
additional organized storage.
• Blank walls or corners are the perfect 
spot for closed cabinet storage furni-
ture pieces. These can hold virtually 
anything.
• Switch out a couple decorative items 
on shelves with storage baskets. You’ll 
be surprised how this simple change 
can go a long way toward keeping 
rooms organized.
• Place decorative garden urns on the 
hearth or on tabletops to corral books, 
magazines, and other little items.
• Set large baskets next to the sofa or 
a chair, and encourage their use as 
catch-alls to keep the area free of 
clutter.
• Assess your trouble spots. Take a close 
look at the items in your living room/
family room that frequently ﬁnd their 
way to the coffee table or identify 
other areas of disarray. For example, if 
games, DVDs, and books tend to pile 
up, consider storing them in cabinets 
and bookshelves in large boxes or bas-
kets with side handles so you can pull 
out the boxes or baskets, grab what 
you want, and put the box or basket 
back rather than pulling out several at 
a time.
• Spray paint old trays and wooden 
boxes in fun colors to help organize 
the coffee table, end tables, or book-
shelves.
• Utilize an old wardrobe or armoire 
for storage in the living room. These 
pieces are tall and really maximize the 
space available. They’re ideal for stor-
ing extra blankets, pillows, and linens.


BATHROOMS
Bathrooms can be challenging rooms to orga-
nize because of all the soaps, lotions, cosmetics, 
linens, and other items commonly housed here. 
But your options for organizing are plentiful 
here, too. Many creative storage and organizing 
products are available, as are hidden areas of 
unused space in this room. The key to getting 
organized is to identify the areas of wasted 
space in your bathroom and capitalize on them 
with smart storage solutions.
Regular purging is also key for organizing the 
bathroom. Tossing old makeup, medicine, and 
other bathroom products you no longer use in-
stantly frees drawer and cabinet space. Keeping 
a plastic bin under the sink for housing rarely 
used items is a great way to make more room 
in drawers and cabinets for the things you and 
your family use daily.

TIP-OUT CABINETS/HAMPERS
A tilt-out cabinet allows you to conve-

GARDEN STOOLS 
Not just for outside, a garden stool 
makes a pretty bathroom accent piece. 
They’re handy for small-space seating 
and can be used to hold extra towels or 
a basket of bath products.
VANITIES
The vanity you choose can help eliminate clutter in and around the bathroom. Choose a vanity with plenty of 
counter and drawer space if you can, rather than a small pedestal sink with no storage. Within the drawers, be 
sure to make the most of the space available with trays, bins, partitions, etc.

All you need for these printable labels is 81⁄2´11-inch (21.5´28cm) sheets of label paper, your 
printer, a pen or marker, and scissors.
To create the labels, go to thecreativityexchange.com/organizing-your-life, and download the

Spray Painted Drawer  
Organizers
DIY PROJECT #6
MATERIALS
Every girl needs a little pop of fun in her makeup cabinet, jewelry box, or desk drawer. This 
is a super simple and inexpensive project to do just that—and keep all your drawers tidy and 
organized! (These fun and colorful organizers work for guys’ stuff, too, of course!)
TOOLS
You certainly can go out and buy colorful, prettily designed, and more expensive organizing  
containers, but here’s a little secret I’ve discovered: desk drawer organizing trays work just as  
well, and they’re easy to customize to match your colors and décor! What’s more, they’re usually 
much less expensive than the designer containers, and you can ﬁnd them in nearly any office 
supply store or even drug store. The trays are often designed in a few different ways, with com-
partments for corralling smaller and larger items alike, making them perfect for organizing almost 
anything—makeup, jewelry, hair accessories, small kitchen gadgets, office supplies, and even nuts 
and bolts in the garage.
The only potential downfall to these trays is their color. Usually black, they’re not all that nice 
to look at (unless black is your color!). That’s where spray paint comes in. With very little work, 
you can open your drawers or cabinets and smile when you see these fun and colorful organizers 
keeping all your stuff in place.
The best way to spray paint plastic and guarantee it won’t scratch off is to use a primer speciﬁcal-
ly made for use on plastic. The trick when using plastic primer is to spray on two coats and allow 
at least 20 minutes between each coat. Then, you must wait at least 1 hour after the second coat 
before painting.

SPRAY PAINTED DRAWER ORGANIZERS
In a well-ventilated area, place your desk trays on a drop cloth, newspaper, or another surface over which you can 
spray paint. Spray on two coats of the plastic primer, allowing the requisite time between each application. When 
you’re ready to paint, spray a light coat of color over the trays and let dry for about 20 minutes.
Less is more when it comes to spraying plastic, so if you need to apply another coat of color, do so lightly. Let your 
trays dry at least 24 to 48 hours to allow for the paint to fully set. For more information, visit thecreativityexchange.

TOY ORGANIZERS
Every child’s bathroom needs some-
thing to corral bath toys. Opt for a large 
plastic bin or tub, and store it under the 
sink and out of sight. Be sure to pick 
one that contains holes so the wet toys 
can drain after use.
DRAWER ORGANIZERS
You can’t have too many drawer organizers in your house. Silverware and kitchen utensil organizers are a great 
way to organize items in vanity drawers. Spray paint them in fun, coordinating colors!
STACKABLES 
Stackable plastic bins help keep the many 
items located in a child’s bathroom in one 
central location. It also teaches them that 
every item has a place other than on the 
countertop.

Creative Drawer Liners
DIY PROJECT #7
MATERIALS
If you have loads of large gift bags taking up space in a drawer or closet, why not repurpose 
them as pretty drawer liners? With this project, you can add a pop of color and fun to your 
drawers—and recycle, too!
TOOLS
 
1.  Choose a bag that has a glossy ﬁnish for easier cleanup. And opt for one large enough to 
cover the entire surface of your drawer so you don’t have to use the folded edges. (The creases 
won’t be pretty.)
 
2.  Measure the inside of your drawer to get the exact width and length.
 
3.  Flatten the gift bag, and measure and mark your drawer measurements. Use a ruler to draw a 
line on which you can cut to be sure the edges are straight.
 
4. Cut the bag on the lines you drew.
 
5.  Place glue dots or double-sided tape in the corners of the drawer and at various spots around 
the edges of the drawer. 
 
6.  Add the recycled drawer liner, and press down to secure.
This fun project isn’t limited to a child’s bathroom; feel free to use this idea anywhere in your house!

TRICK #1
RECYCLE VOTIVE CANDLEHOLDERS AS BATHROOM STORAGE
I encourage you to get creative when thinking about containers in which you can store items. For example, if you have 
several unused glass candleholders, repurpose them as bathroom storage containers. If the candleholders still have 
candle wax in the bottom, pop them into the freezer for a couple hours. As the wax freezes, it condenses. You might 
be able to wiggle it out using your ﬁngers, or you might have to carefully chip it out using a butter knife. Remove any 
remaining wax residue from the sides with a quick trip through the dishwasher. Use these pretty little containers for 
holding cotton swabs, makeup removers, and more.

TRICK #2
INSTALL HOOKS FOR TOWELS
In busy bathrooms—children’s or otherwise—towels are sometimes hurridly tossed on the ﬂoor. To help everyone 
remember to hang their towels, it helps to have a dedicated towel rack that’s easy to see and, therefore, remember to 
use. To help your childen remember to hang their towels, install a row of hooks in their bathroom, allowing a speciﬁc 
hook for each child and maybe an extra one if you have room. Double hooks provide even more storage for towels, 
robes, or small buckets that hold kids’ bath products.

tips
• Install additional towel racks on the 
wall behind the bathroom door. Con-
sider adding two towel racks, one low-
er and the other higher, for additional 
towel storage.
• Utilize the corners of the bathroom 
for small glass or metal multitiered 
bathroom shelving to hold towels and 
bath products.
• Make use of the wall space over towel 
racks and toilets for additional storage 
or wall cabinets.
• Hang ﬂoating shelves next to the  
vanity and bathtub area to create 
additional storage adjacent to where 
products are used the most.
• Tuck shoe shelving in the cabinets un-
der the sink for a quick and easy way 
to create extra shelving and maximize 
the height of this space.
• Set a basket in a corner next to the 
toilet to store extra toilet paper, which 
frees up space in cabinets for other 
items.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look at the 
cabinets that give you the most prob-
lems in the bathroom and determine if 
you need to purge items or ﬁnd better 
storage options. If you have adjustable 
shelving, maximize the height of the 
shelves to accommodate the height of 
the items you’re storing.
• Use garden urns and glass candle- 
holders for a pretty and functional way 
to store bath products and supplies on 
the top of the vanity and on shelves.
• Paint an old dresser or nightstand with 
a high-gloss paint to protect it from 
moisture, and use it for an additional 
organizing surface on top and storage 
in the drawers below.


LAUNDRY 
ROOM
Even though laundry rooms vary in size and 
style from home to home, the key to getting—
and staying—organized here remains the same: 
maximizing every area you have available and 
choosing functional storage pieces that ﬁt with 
how you and your family use the laundry space.
In this section, you see three very different 
laundry spaces, each loaded with creative orga-
nizing ideas and examples of taking full advan-
tage of the space available. All three also boast 
functional and creative ways of storing supplies 
and areas for folding and hanging clothes. With 
a few smart strategies, you, too, can have an 
organized laundry room.

Wire shelving systems enable you to create custom organization and storage solutions. 
They’re often easy to install, and they’re very designed to be very customizable to the space

TEM INSTRUCTIONS
Nearly anywhere you have a blank wall, you can design and install a wire shelving 
system that ﬁts your speciﬁc storage and organization needs. For example, my laundry 
room originally had quite a bit of unused wall space. The room isn’t large, but it does 
have some unused wall space I was keen on taking advantage of.
To begin, I installed short upright braces to three walls and then added the brackets 
to hold the wire shelves. Using the combination of braces and brackets enables me to 
adjust the height of my shelves as necessary.
I then installed a shelf close to the ceiling that wrapped around all three walls. The 
brand of wire shelving I used offered a hanging rod on the bottom of the shelf as well as 
hooks for extra storage.
On the wall facing the washer and dryer, where I had more vertical space to work with, I 
added more wire shelving, this time with longer uprights and more brackets with shorter 
shelves.
By evaluating where I wasn’t using my walls effectively, and planning what combination 
of wire system products would help me maximize the space I had available, I was able to 
create an area for organization with lots of surplus storage. For more how-to information 
and inspirational photos, visit thecreativityexchange.com/organizing-your-life.

Adding a row of small hooks in a narrow area such as the laundry room is an easy way to use wasted space and create 
more storage options. Use these hooks to hang empty laundry bags, mesh washing bags, and cleaning supplies like 
brooms or feather duster. Multi-hook units you can install on the wall come in many different sizes and styles so 
you’re sure to ﬁnd something you can use.

ADD A SHELF NEXT TO THE WASHER
Floating shelves are easy to install and come in a variety of styles. Plus, they often don’t take up a lot of space. If 
you’re limited on shelf space in your laundry room, consider installing a a ﬂoating shelf next to your washing ma-
chine. This is the perfect spot to hold stain-remover pens, scissors, and the little stuff you need as you put clothes in 
the washer. Add clear glass candleholders or small jars to contain smaller items.

tips
• On the wall behind the laundry room 
door, hang wall storage pieces that can 
hold mops, brooms, dusters, and more.
• Opt for shelving or cabinets that ﬁll 
the space all the way up to the ceiling. 
Keep a step ladder in the laundry room 
so you can access these upper areas 
easily.
• Adjust shelving to ﬁt each storage 
piece to make the most of the space 
available.
• Make use of stackable plastic bins to 
organize lots of little stuff.
• Next to a laundry sink or behind the 
washer and dryer, install narrow shelv-
ing traditionally used in bathrooms to 
organize small things.
• Hang over-the-door baskets inside 
cabinet doors to provide additional 
storage.
• Assess your trouble spots. Take a 
close look at your laundry room on its 
worst day and pinpoint the areas and 
items that seem the most unorganized. 
For example, if clothes are frequent-
ly tossed on top of the washer and 
dryer waiting to be folded, consider 
incorporating tall expandable laun-
dry hampers in cabinets (you might 
have to remove a shelf) or underneath 
shelving to store clean clothes until 
you have time to fold them.
• Use plastic storage bins, small wood 
crates, or baskets to help organize 
cabinets or shelves.
• Tuck old trays, caddies, and buckets in 
and around the laundry room and un-
derneath sink areas to hold whatever 
stray items you need them to hold.


CLOSETS
Closets can be a challenging space to organize 
because they can quickly become a catch-all 
for stuff you don’t know what to do with or 
have room for elsewhere. It can get so bad, you 
might dread even thinking about the idea of 
organizing a closet and feel overwhelmed when 
you door. But you can get control over your 
closets!
The key to getting and keeping your closets 
organized is to not empty out the closet all at 
once because it’s too tempting to just give up 
later and put everything back without seeing 
your organizing attempt through to comple-
tion. If you work section by section, a little at a 
time, you eventually will get there—and won’t 
be overwhelmed by seeing the closet contents 
scattered all over the room. If you choose the 
right storage pieces to maximize the space you 
have, you can sometimes double the amount of 
storage space in available in your closet.

MASTER CLOSET TRANSFORMATION
In this vanity area, several small 
screws hold necklaces long and 
short on the sides, and a clear plastic 
mail organizer serves as a stand for 
clutch purses. Below, drawers (con-
structed from the same MDF) hold 
smaller pieces of jewelry like rings 
and earrings.
Under the vanity area, a short closet 
rod and some shower curtain hooks 
provide an out-of-the-way spot for 
handbag storage.
Most of the functional storage is on 
the left side. Here, Kelly has all out-
of-season clothes in baskets, stored 
at the top of the closet, out of the 
way. In-season clothes hang below, 
over shelves that corral shoes.
In a narrow space next to the hang-
ing clothes, she has a slide-out scarf 
organizer where scarfs are looped 
around short towel bars.
Shelves below offer orderly and compact shoe storage.
Kelly is thrilled with how her closet has been transformed with some clever 
storage solutions and some help from her handy husband, who built the cus-
tom pieces. For more details and additional images, go to viewalongtheway.

JEWELRY BOXES
Oversize jewelry boxes or wood tool 
storage boxes are fantastic all-in-one 
storage pieces for jewelry. They hold 
a variety of accessories in a compact 
space and offer tiny compartments for 
small pieces like rings and earrings. 
Opt for a color that matches your other 
closet storage pieces if you can.
DRESSERS
Move dressers you’re not using in other 
rooms into your closet. If they’re short, 
tuck them under shorter hanging clothes. 
This frees up space in other rooms and 
gives you more closet storage. If you can, 
choose pieces that match to give your

SHOE SHELVING UNITS
The number-one wasted space in closets is up

PRINTABLE CLOSET ORGANIZATION WORKSHEET
Determine what areas of your closet are wast-
ed space or spots where you could create new 
organization opportunities. Circle these areas 
on your sketch. Then ask yourself:
 
•  What areas am I currently not  
maximizing?
 
•  Could I move any storage pieces currently 
in my closet to other areas if they work 
better somewhere else?
 
•  What hanging pieces could I move 
around or add to maximize the space 
available?
Go back to your closet and measure the areas 
you circled on your sketch. Write these dimen-
sions on your sketch.
Determine what color storage pieces will best 
coordinate with the trim and shelving in your 
closet. Note that if you choose any color other 
than white, dark brown, or black, you might 
have some difficulty ﬁnding standard storage 
pieces.
Search online for new storage pieces. Be sure 
to carefully check dimensions and look for 
color options that are close to your trim/ 
shelving color. Also try to make the most of 
your space available by choosing storage 
pieces that are functional and won’t leave you 
with any wasted space. Bookmark or list here 
the storage pieces you’re interested in:

Draw the potential new storage pieces in your 
sketch of your closet, and erase and move any 
existing storage changes you can make. This 
helps you come to a decision on what storage 
pieces you should purchase.
Purge your closet of any unwanted items. A 
good rule of thumb is if you haven’t worn it or 
used it for a year, get rid of it.
Instead of empting out your whole closet to 
begin your reorganization, work section by 
section, incorporating and ﬁlling new storage 
pieces as you go. This way you can step away 
from reorganizing for a day or two and not be 
tempted to just give up and put everything 
back where it was.
As you ﬁnish adding your new storage pieces, 
take note of areas where you could employ 
more baskets, bins, and other special smaller 
pieces to keep your closet organized—for good.

Catch-All Closet Cubbies
DIY PROJECT #11
MATERIALS
If your closet is on the verge of becoming an out-of-control mess of items you don’t know where 
else to put anywhere else, this project is for you. Best of all, it’s easy to implement and fairly 
inexpensive. With the help of some simple-to-assemble premade closet storage pieces, you can 
tuck every last item in your closet in its rightful, organized place.
TOOLS
The keys to this project, like so many others, are careful planning, a smart design, and making the 
most of the space available.
Start by looking at your closet. Really look at it. Where do you have unused space? Maybe, like I 
did, you have a wall with a shelf and a rod that’s meant to hang clothes that you’re not using for 
that purpose. Instead, stuff is just stacking up on the ﬂoor below the shelf in a chaotic mess. Why 
not ﬁll that wall with storage cubbies to organize all your stuff? You could triple the amount of 
storage you have!
After I measured my wall space available, I purchased inexpensive premade closet storage cubes, 
brought them home, and put them together. Assembly only took about 20 minutes, and I was 
surprised how sturdy and well made they are for the price.
I bought a few units: I got a six-cube unit for the left side of the wall and a nine-cube unit for the 
right side. This ﬁlled my wall with cubes. I also purchased a few premade shoe shelving units and 
popped them on top of the cube units for additional storage up by the ceiling. I placed a second 
six-cube unit on its side at the bottom of my closet.
Then I ﬁlled the cubes with baskets and bins to house various types of items neatly and orderly. 
No more chaotic mess! For more how-to information and inspirational photos, visit

PEGBOARD HOOKS
You can store just about anything on 
pegboard hooks beyond what they were

use different size hooks to hold scissors, 
tools, buckets, and even rods to house 
rolls of ribbon and twine.
BRACKETS AND SHELVES
Install shelving with brackets (secured 
to the studs for extra strength) in the 
top of your closet. Use this shelving to 
hold books, baskets, craft supplies, and 
other heavier items safely.

SPRAY PAINT MISMATCHED CRATES AND OTHER STORAGE PIECES
You don’t have to go out and buy all new matching storage pieces to get organized. You can use what you likely al-
ready have around your house and give the mismatched pieces a uniﬁed look with spray paint. If your items are plas-
tic, be sure you use primer and paint speciﬁcally designed for use with plastic. Follow the manufacturers’ instructions 
for prep and top coat of your various plastic crates, beverage carriers, or other plastic pieces. Let them dry completely 
before ﬁlling them and tucking them into your closet.

CREATIVE BAG STORAGE
If you have several different-size bags taking up space in various areas of your closets, try this quick trick: instead of 
storing several bags separately, group them together in a large, narrow, sturdy plastic tote bag with handles. 
Fold all your totes and bags ﬂat, and tuck them into the large plastic tote. Pull out all the handles so you can remove 
the bag you want without disturbing the rest of the bags.

tips
• Look up! The top of the closet is a 
great source of additional storage. If 
you have open shelving at the top of 
your closet, add shoe shelving all the 
way around to provide an additional 
shelf for shoes—or anything else.
• Maximize the space below hanging 
clothes. Slide a short, two-door dresser 
underneath shirts, and you instantly 
create extra storage.
• Fill a closet wall with narrow cube 
storage units. The individual cube 
compartments can help keep things 
separated and in order.
• Make the most of shelf space with 
plastic stackable bins. They’re ideal for 
organizing small items.
• Add a narrow dresser to a clothes clos-
et, junk closet, or craft closet, and ﬁll 
the drawers with deep drawer organiz-
ing pieces to corral all kinds of things.
• Use over-the-door, multitiered wire 
basket storage pieces to provide 
additional storage for accessories and 
smaller items.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look at 
your closet ﬂoor when it’s unorganized. 
What types of items do you see there? 
If your problem is shoes or handbags, 
consider incorporating additional shoe 
storage on a shelf or try over-the-door 
shoe and handbag holders. What other 
items always seem to be disorganized? 
Look for speciﬁc organization pieces 
to store these items, whatever they 
might be.
• If you don’t have room for a dresser, 
see if an end table with shelving will 
ﬁt in your closet to incorporate more 
storage.
• Use crates, baskets, and bins to catch 
sandals, ﬂip-ﬂops, and tennis shoes 
in clothes closets, supplies in craft 
closets, and miscellaneous little stuff 
in junk closets.


BEDROOMS
The bedroom is one of the most underutilized 
rooms in the home when it comes to organizing 
and incorporating storage. The reason for this 
is often because we want to keep this restful 
place, where we relax and recharge, as free of 
clutter as possible. And that’s understandable. 
But the truth is, by incorporating just a few 
storage pieces in your bedroom, you can free 
up space in your closets or elsewhere without 
adding clutter to your restful room.
So many fantastic hidden-storage pieces are 
available today, and many are ideal for the bed-
room. Using these pieces to store out-of-season 
clothing, shoes, or items that seem to always be 
overﬂowing elsewhere can make a huge impact. 
The key to bedroom organization is choosing 
furniture pieces with the maximum amount of 
storage and functionality and thinking about 
creative ways you can take advantage of this 
underutilized space.

THE MASTER BEDROOM
ARMOIRES
Armoires have many uses in the bed-
room beyond just storing clothes. Use 
the bottom part to store clothes but then 
set your TV in the top so you can close 
it away when you’re not using it. Add 
baskets or decorative trunks to the very 
top for even more storage.
UNDER THE BED
With the right boxes, baskets, bins, or
trays, you can transform the space 
under your bed—an area that’s often 
overlooked and forgotten about as an 
organizing opportunity—into a beneﬁ-
cial storage spot.
BASKETS
If you’re like me, reading material close 
to the bed is a must. Add baskets or 
other storage pieces to your nightstand 
or next to your bed to hold reading 
materials.
FUNCTIONAL NIGHTSTANDS
Choosing the right nightstand can make 
all the difference when organizing your 
bedroom. Rather than simple tables, 
choose nightstands that offer additional 
storage in drawers and shelves.

THE GUEST

THE GUEST BEDROOM
DECORATIVE BOXES
Provide small decorative boxes around 
the room your guest can use for his or 
her jewelry, watch, wallet, etc. This helps 
keep those items secure and less likely 
to get lost.
LARGER BASKETS
Set a larger basket in the guest room in 
which your guests can drop their used 
towels and linens. This keeps them off the 
ﬂoor or another piece of furniture (espe-
cially wet towels) and makes it easier for 
you to ﬁnd and grab when you’re ready to 
do laundry.
NESTING TABLES
Nesting tables allow for extra storage and 
tabletop surfaces when you want them but 
then easily tuck, or nest, back together 
when not in use. They’re very versatile and 
handy for guests to pull out and use around 
the room as they like.
BENCHES
A guest room bench offers extra seating 
and a spot for your visitors to set their 
suitcases.

THE

THE NIGHTSTAND
NIGHTSTAND DRAWERS
When possible, opt for a nightstand that 
has one or more drawers for addition-
al storage. If you charge your phone 
or tablet on your nightstand, you can 
convert a drawer into a hidden charging 
station by drilling a hole in the back of 
the drawer through which to run cords.
PLANTERS
A small decorative garden planter is 
a pretty and functional way to contain 
remotes, cell phones, pens, and other 
nightstand necessities.
NIGHTSTAND SHELVES
If your nightstand has a bottom shelf, it 
can be home to a basket or bin in which 
you keep books and magazines, cords 
and accessories for your phone or tablet, 
ﬂashlights, or other items you want 
close to your bed.
LIDDED BOXES
Add a lidded box to your nightstand 
to hold pens and paper, headphones or 
phone charge cords, and other items you 
might need while you’re in bed. This 
keeps these items within reach but closes 
away the clutter, out of sight.

STORAGE IDEAS
STORAGE BENCHES
A storage bench or large ottoman at the 
end of the bed can serve as extra seating 
as well as provide additional organiz-
ing opportunities. Tuck out-of-season 
clothes, extra blankets, or other items 
commonly stored in the closet here 
instead to free up space in the closet.
NIGHTSTAND WITH DRAWERS AND 
CLOSED-DOOR STORAGE
Choosing a nightstand with lots of 
additional storage in drawers and hidden 
storage can help keep the bedroom 
organized. A narrow dresser is a smart 
alternative to a traditional nightstand.

DRESSERS
Larger dressers and chests of drawers offer as an 
upper surface upon which you can organize books, 
jewelry, or other accessories as well as hidden stor-
age below. The more drawers the dresser has, the 
more you can separate and organize folded items.
ARMOIRES
Tall armoires or wardrobes are ideal in 
the bedroom because these pieces max-
imize space from the ﬂoor to the ceiling. 
Look for an armoire constructed with 
drawers in the bottom half for clothes or 
blankets and an upper area with doors 
behind which you can set a television.

CHILDREN’S BEDROOMS
UNDER-THE-BED OPTIONS
The space under the bed usually goes 
unused, not only in children’s bedrooms, 
but in adult and guest bedrooms, too. 
Make the most of this area with a few 
shallow storage boxes used to hold 
keepsakes, out-of-season clothes, or 
extra shoes.
CORNER BOOKSHELVES
Corner bookshelves ﬁll that space in 
the corner of a child’s bedroom where 
nothing else seems to ﬁt. Fill the shelves 
with baskets and bins for easy-access 
storage.
NIGHTSTANDS
A functional nightstand with lots of
storage is essential in a child’s room. 
Use the drawer to contain small items; 
the open storage below is perfect for 
bedtime books.
CABINETS AND SHELVES
Bookshelves and other cabinets are 
handy throughout the house, but they’re 
especially useful in children’s rooms. Set 
them up to house frequently used toys, 
books, and other items, and encourage 
your children to return their things to the 
shelves when they’re done with them.

PLASTIC TUBS
Recycle large plastic food tubs as fun

CANDY JARS
Clear, lidded jars are a great way to help 
kids organize smaller items. The lids 
keep everything in place and reduce the 
chances of spills. Group several on a 
shelf for a uniﬁed look.
Rethink where you 
can use kitchen 
storage pieces, 
like these candy 
jars.
TRUNKS
Trunks of any size are useful in chil-

MAGAZINE HOLDERS
Paper is essential in many childhood crafts and 
projects. Instead of having a lot of loose paper 
laying around, turn magazine holders on their 
sides and use to store craft paper, notebooks, 
magazines, etc.
REUSE PACKAGING
Don’t throw away the boxes your child’s 
toys come in. Instead, use them to store the item 
when not in use. Your child will recognize the 
packaging and immediately know that’s where the 
toy belongs.

EASY-ACCESS BINS AND BASKETS
It can be difficult to get children to clean up after 
themselves. Make it easier for them by having bins 
and baskets housed on lower shelves at their eye

to keep their space tidy by tossing their toys, 
books, and other play items in these bins for quick 
cleanup.

WALL POCKETS
Adhere bins, baskets, and wall pockets 
above your child’s desk to hold paper, 
pens, and other craft supplies, reducing 
desktop clutter.
STORAGE BOXES
Coordinating cardboard or plastic boxes 
designed to hold magazines, photos, or

other items up and out of the way. Be 
sure to label the boxes so you know at a 
glance what’s in them!
TOOL BOXES
Look for storage solutions that work for

PLASTIC CARRY TOTES
Use inexpensive plastic totes with han-

stuffed animals, etc. toys together by 
activity. Your little one can then pull out 
just the tote he or she wants to play with.
169
Bench-style toy boxes (or large storage ottomans) help keep children’s spaces organized, provide 
hidden storage, and offer extra seating. Slide handled totes, bags, or plastic containers into the 
toy box and use them to group toys by activity. During playtime, your child can pull out just the 
tote containing the toys he or she wants to play with and leave everything else neatly inside the box. 
When playtime is over, cleanup is quick and easy. Just toss the toys back into the tote and slide the 
tote back in it’s spot in the toy box.

DIY PROJECT #12
First I removed the old fabric-covered lid 
and the decorative nail heads holding on the 
fabric.
Using 4 yards (3.75m) of white twill fabric, 
and allowing for a hem at the bottom and 
excess fabric to go over the lip separating 
the lid and the storage part of the bench, 
I tacked on the ﬁrst wraparound layer of 
fabric using upholstery nail tacks placed on 
the inside of the bench. I stared wrapping 
on the far left side and ended on the back by 
folding in and tacking the fabric.

I measured and marked where the faux panels would go. 
To that measure, I added 1 inch (2.5cm) on both sides so 
I could fold in and hem the sides. I then measured from 
the ﬂoor to where I’d nail the top of the panel to the front 
of the bench and added 3⁄4 inch (2cm) to fold the top 
over and nail. I attached the faux panels using uphol-
stery nails.
I covered the top edges of the faux panels with decora-
tive gimp trim and secured it with brass nail heads about 
every 11⁄2 inches (3.75cm).
I then cut two 4-inch (10cm) poly foam cushions to ﬁt the 
top of the bench and hot glued the foam pieces to each 
other and to the bench. I covered the foam with a layer of 
batting, stretched smooth and tight, and nailed it to the 
lid.
I then covered the cushion with upholstery fabric stapled 
it in place. Finally, I reattached the back hinges to the lid 
and to the bottom part of the bench.
By reusing a piece I already had, I was able to save  
money and get a fun and functional “new” storage piece!

Don’t toss out those bulk-size plastic food tubs you get

washer, where it could melt), remove the label, and use in

USE SWIVEL-STYLE POWER STRIPS 
A quick trick for keeping cords and and plugs organized in tight spots such as behind beds and nightstands is to 
use swivel-style power strips that twist to the side so plugs are parallel to the wall instead of perpendicular to it. This 
makes it easier to access and use the plugs and also allows you to push furniture closer to the wall. You can label each 
cord by writing on a piece of tape and folding the tape over the cord for quick identiﬁcation.

tips
• Take advantage of an unused wall to 
hold an additional dresser, armoire, or 
wardrobe to create more organizing 
and storage opportunities.
• Set an upholstered storage bench at 
the end of your bed, and use it to store 
sweaters, blankets, or bedroom linens. 
As a bonus, it doubles as extra seating.
• Employ large baskets in corners or 
next to nightstands or dressers as 
catch-alls for books, magazines, and 
other items.
• Add a small table next to a bedroom 
chair for an additional tabletop that 
can hold decorative bowls or wooden 
boxes for neatly storing smaller items.
• Fill the tops of armoires, bedroom me-
dia centers, and wardrobes with pretty 
baskets to organize rarely used items.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look 
around your room and determine what 
items seem to continually clutter your 
bedroom. Pinpointing those things 
you regularly have to pick up helps 
you think about what solutions you 
need to help better organize your 
space. For example, if clothing and 
shoes are a problem, that may be a 
sign that you need to create more 
storage in your closet and dressers. 
Having a very large decorative basket 
in the bedroom is a great spot in which 
you can quickly toss items to orga-
nize later but still keep the bedroom 
clutter-free.
• Set a narrow bookshelf along an un-
used wall, and ﬁll it with coordinating 
baskets to house a variety of items.
• Arrange small decorative garden urns, 
glass trays, or pretty wood boxes on 
nightstands and dresser tops to store 
little things.


NURSERY
If you have a baby, you also have a lot of the 
stuff that comes along with having a little one. 
Diapers, clothes, toys, baby care and transporta-
tion items—the nursery is home to so many lit-
tle things that without good storage solutions, 
this room can get out of control quickly.
Key to organizing a nursery is focusing on the 
function of the room and choosing storage 
pieces that work for the way you use the space. 
Setting up a nursery based on tasks and group-
ing together everything related to that task in 
open shelving helps save time and extra steps. 
Organize all diaper-related items together, all 
sleep-related things together, and all play- 
related pieces together.

CRIB STORAGE
A crib with a drawer underneath

CHANGING TABLE DIAPER STATION
When you’re changing your baby, you 
want all the products and supplies you 
need close by so you don’t have to walk 
around to get anything. Use a bin or try 
to hold these items.
BOOKSHELVES
When placing a bookshelf in a nursery,
set it horizontal, like a bench, rather than 
vertical. This helps create a safe environ-
ment for your baby by keeping everything 
low to the ground and adds extra storage.

units together and secure to the wall for even more 
small-cube storage.
WIRE CART
Turn a wire cart into a mobile baby care 
unit you can move around the house as

tips
• Utilize the space below the crib with 
under-the-crib storage pieces. This is a 
great place to store play toys that can 
be pulled out during play time. Add a 
crib bedskirt to hide the storage.
• Install open, ﬂoor-to-ceiling shelving 
pieces—bolted to the wall for safety—to 
maximize wall space and create addi-
tional storage.
• Add premade shoe storage units to the 
top shelves in the nursery closet for 
extra organizing opportunities.
• Opt for bin-style baskets. Most of the 
time you only have one free arm while 
you’re in this room, holding your baby 
in your other arm.
• Use large, open, soft baskets in the 
nursery. They’re safe for little ones and 
also are handy to corral items you can 
organize later.
• Consider long bread baskets for stor-
ing little stuff on shelves or in closets. 
They maximize the depth of a shelf.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look at the 
way your nursery is laid out and ask 
yourself what tasks seem the most 
challenging. For example, if you ﬁnd 
yourself taking extra steps with the 
baby from the changing table to the 
closet, consider adding a row of bas-
kets underneath the changing table for 
quick changes of clothing.
• Transform an old media or entertain-
ment center to pretty open shelving 
by adding a shelf across the opening 
where the television would go and 
insert large baskets. Update the piece 
with a fresh coat of paint in fun, bright 
color. Bolt the unit to the wall for safe-
ty if you like.
• Load up a multitiered end table or a 
side table with open shelving with 
baskets for additional storage next to 
the rocker or along a blank wall.


PLAYROOM
Believe it or not, creating a space somewhere 
in your home for a playroom for your children 
goes a long way in getting other areas of your 
home organized. Converting a rarely used 
guest room, basement, family room—or even 
a large closet if you don’t have another free 
room—into a dedicated play area helps keep 
toys, activities, and all the related little stuff 
corralled in one space and not strewn around 
your home.
Getting organized in the playroom means in-
corporating as many storage furniture pieces 
as possible, with deep bins and baskets for 
quick and easy cleanup. If your kids know 
where everything goes and it’s easy for them 
to help tidy up their area, they’re more likely to 
help keep things orderly. As a bonus, this is a 
wonderful opportunity to begin teaching them 
about organization and how to clean up after 
themselves!

OPEN BASKETS/BINS
Open baskets are important in a child’s 
area. They enable easy access and make 
cleanup simple. Encourage your little 
ones to toss their toys in the appropriate 
bins when play time is over.
DUAL-PURPOSE PIECES
Maximize your space by using dual- 
purpose pieces. For instance, look for seat-
ing that also offers storage underneath. Or 
tip a sturdy bookshelf on its side and use it 
horizontally. Add a comfy cushion on top 
and baskets or bins below for storage.
WALL POCKETS
Playrooms can become disorganized very 
quickly. Keep more items up off the ﬂoor using 
wall pockets. You can buy speciﬁc wall storage 
pieces or mount crates or strong baskets to the 
wall. Keep them at your children’s eye level so 
they can grab the books, toys, or games they 
want in a hurry.

Using a bookshelf or entertainment cen-

child’s level to organize toys. Fill the cubes with 
plastic bins and baskets, and label them so your 
little one knows what goes where. 
A low table is perfect for use in the playroom. Slip 
small storage ottomans underneath for both seat-
ing and another spot to hold toys and games.

FABRIC BINS
Lightweight fabric bins with handles are durable 
and light enough for children to easily pull out to 
access. These bins can hold and organize many 
items. 
HANDLES, HANDLES, AND MORE HANDLES
Opt for handles whenever you can in playroom 
storage. Handled caddies, bins, and buckets are 
perfect for storing little stuff, and your little ones 
can easily grab what they want and go.

THE

THE MEDIA CENTER
UPPER SHELVES
You want to keep most of your children’s toys, games, and 
activities where they’re easy for the little ones to reach, but 
when it comes to expensive game systems, opt for the upper 
shelves. Keep them on the high shelves, where younger chil-
dren can’t reach them, to reduce the changes of these pricey 
systems getting broken or damaged.
ADJUSTABLE SHELVES
If your media center or bookshelves have adjustable shelv-
ing, get creative with how you position the shelves. Adjust or 
remove shelves as necessary to store larger or taller toys.
Note: For safety, it’s essential that you bolt or otherwise 
secure bookshelves and media centers to the wall in areas 
where your children will be.
CARD BOXES
Card or shoe boxes work well for storing 
and organizing video games or DVDs.
DURABLE CONTAINERS
Use fabric bins, buckets, and caddies 
throughout the playroom to store almost 
anything, from movies and music to craft 
supplies and coloring books. The more 
durable and lightweight the containers 
are, the better for your little ones.

CREATE AN ART BUCKET
Store kids’ markers, crayons, and other craft supplies in a large bucket ﬁtted with an organizer made to hold tools. 
(You can ﬁnd these at your local home improvement store.) Slide the tool organizer over the bucket, ﬁll with craft 
supplies, and set it next to or under the playroom table or somewhere your children can easily reach it. All your craft 
supplies have a home, and your children can carry it wherever they want to get creative.

tips
• Choose shelving and furniture storage 
pieces that go from ﬂoor to ceiling—
and bolt them to the wall for safety—to 
maximize wall space.
• Set a low toddler play table in the mid-
dle of the room, and tuck additional 
storage underneath.
• Install cube or cubby storage along 
unused walls to make the most of your 
space. Include separate areas for orga-
nizing toys and activities.
• Stock up on deep storage bins with 
wheels. Kids can push the bin to their 
play area and then it’s right next to 
them when it’s time for cleanup.
• Slide round plastic tubs with handles 
into cabinets to help contain the little 
stuff. Keep them on lower shelves so 
they’re still accessible to little ones.
• Use large trays for ongoing activities 
like puzzles or crafts. They’re easy to 
transfer to a shelf or cabinet for quick 
cleanup and pull out again later to 
continue the activity.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look at 
your playroom after you’ve tidied it up, 
and pinpoint what items are over-
ﬂowing or don’t have a good home. 
For example, if large toys seem to still 
be scattered and don’t have a clear 
storage space, consider inexpensive, 
multitiered kitchen storage carts with 
wheels in the playroom closet or in a 
corner for storing these larger toys.
• Make liberal use of storage bins, 
baskets, or crates in the playroom. For 
a quick update, spray paint all these 
pieces in fun bright colors.
• Wash large, clear, pretzel or snack tubs 
when they’re empty, and use them for 
see-through storage for small items.


OFFICE
It doesn’t matter whether you have a dedicated 
room for an office or a desk tucked away in the 
corner of another room in your home; the steps 
for getting and keeping your office organized 
are the same. Choosing the right storage pieces 
to maximize your available area and organiz-
ing your office by task helps you improve your 
efficiency and order in your office.
Take an honest look around your office space, 
and identify those items or areas that aren’t 
organized or could use more efficient storage 
pieces. At the same time, think about how you 
could better utilize and arrange your space. 
Taking the time to assess and identify your  
office trouble spots and creating long-term 
solutions can transform your office almost  
instantly.

BULLETIN BOARDS
Every office needs a bulletin board. Add 
a board (or two) in your office to pin re-
minders, to-do lists, photos, invitations, 
and other essential information you 
need to remember.
CABINETS OR SHELVES
Think about adding a simple cabinet or
shelving unit above your workstation.
This provides additional storage
for books, supplies, and even a printer.
LARGE BASKETS/BINS
You can’t go wrong by adding
baskets or bins to your office space.
These are ideal for tossing items into
that you can sort or ﬁle away later. 
These handy containers enable you to 
keep your office clutter free and allow 
for quick cleanup.
DESK WITH STORAGE
It’s importance to start with a desk with 
plenty of storage and drawer space. Your 
desk needn’t be big and bulky either.

DESK ORGANIZERS
Your desktop is no place for clutter. Use 
multipurpose desk organizers to store 
frequently used items close by while 
keeping your desktop clear and usable.

er place for all the papers, bills, notes, and 
other items that accumulate in the office.

Converting a Desk to a 
Built-In
DIY PROJECT #13
I bought this desk from a friend who no 
longer needed it. It’s a nice piece, made 
of solid wood, and it’s in good condition. I 
really liked the idea of having everything I 
need for my office—the ﬁle cabinets, bulletin 
boards, the desk itself, and the paper sorter 
and cubbies up top—in one piece of fur-
niture, but neither the color or the style is ex-
actly what I wanted in my office/craft room.
A coat of paint would ﬁx the color. First I 
removed the knob pulls and sanded the 
entire piece.
MATERIALS
Custom-made built-ins are very nice, but they’re also very expensive. Luckily, you can re-create 
the look of a built-in by using regular pieces of furniture, transforming them to more resemble 
their higher-priced counterparts. And you don’t have to be a professional contractor to do it!

CONVERTING A DESK TO A BUILT-IN
After removing the top molding to better ﬁt the style I 
wanted, I added a coat of primer.
Then I painted the piece to coordinate with the colors in 
my office/craft room. (Note I didn’t paint the area behind 
the bulletin board because it would be covered later 
when I updated the bulletin board.)
Finally, I added new hardware to the drawers and re-
vamped the bulletin board.
I’m quite pleased with the ﬁnished piece. I’ve found it’s 
the perfect piece of furniture to ﬁt the space, and it really 
helps keep my office area organized! For more how-to

SMALL ITEM ORGANIZERS
Screw a metal plate to the inside of the
armoire, and use magnetic tins and 
hooks to store paperclips, pins, staples, 
and other office-related items.
DOOR ORGANIZERS
Fit in organizing opportunities whereev-
er you can. For example, paint the inside 
of the armoire doors with chalkboard 
paint or add corkboard (covered with 
fabric if you like) to hold to-do lists, 
notes, reminders, etc.
MAXIMIZE SPACE
Dedicate the bottom portion of the armoire as

Bulletin Board Revamp
DIY PROJECT #14
My desk has built-in bulletin boards, but they 
were plain cork board—not very pretty, and not 
anything that inspired me to use them to orga-
nize my desk. A fun and chic fabric covering 
seemed quite appropriate!
Covering a bulletin board is an easy way to 
incorporate a pop of color and design into a 
space. And it doesn’t take much fabric at all, so 
you can splurge on something really special if 
you like.
I removed the desk’s back panel that holds 
the boards in place, centered and covered the 
boards with fabric, and inserted tacks in all 
four corners to secure the fabric. I returned 
the boards to the desk, and reattached the 
back panel. (If you’re covering a free-standing 
framed bulletin board, center and cut your 
fabric to ﬁt the inside of the frame, adding an 
extra 1 inch; 2.5cm of fabric on all four sides to 
tuck under the edge of the frame.)
MATERIALS
Organizing is about creating order out of chaos, and that applies to more than just the stuff in 
your closets, pantry, and garage. It also applies to your office, and especially your desk. A bul-
letin board can be an ideal way to organize your thoughts, to-do lists, bills, shopping lists, and 
so much more. If you have a blah and boring bulletin board, why not revamp it into something 
pretty you’ll love to use?

I used a paint scraper (you also can use a butter knife) to 
tuck the fabric behind the desk frame and get it smooth 
and tight.
For a decorative touch, and to help keep the fabric in 
place, I added a nail head trim using standard office 
thumbtacks. I stuck tacks in all four corners ﬁrst. Then, 
to ensure I added them evenly spaced around the edges, 
I stuck tacks in the midpoints of the boards. To ﬁnish, I 
continued adding tacks evenly around the edges.
I love the end result, and I use my pretty new bulletin boards so much! For more how-to information and inspirational

Handy Hardware Binder
DIY PROJECT #15
I used a 4-inch (10cm) three-ring binder 
to organize my family’s electronic device 
hardware and 12 1-quart (1l) plastic reseal-
able bags and two 1-gallon (3.75l) plastic 
resealable bags to hold the accessories. I cut 
a manila folder to ﬁt inside each size of bag 
for strength, printed labels for each device, 
and placed the label on the folder. I tucked 
the folders inside the bags and punched 
holes through both the bag and the folder 
using a three-hole punch.
For easiest access, I punched the holes at the 
bottom of the plastic bags so the opening is 
at the edge of the binder.
MATERIALS
The more electronic equipment you have, the more cords, chargers, cables, and other accesso-
ries you have to go along with them. Cell phones, computers, tablets, MP3 players—each comes 
with its own speciﬁc cables and cords, and organizing all those items can be a challenge. Not 
anymore. This quick and easy project helps you organize all those items once and for all.

also show the labels. To each bag, I added instructions, 
USB cables, chargers, and any other accessories for each 
device, putting the most frequently used bags at the 
front of the binder.
In the back, I added another 1-gallon (3.75l) plastic re-
sealable bag for unknown cables, chargers, and accesso-

tips
• On the wall either in front of your desk 
(if your desk is against the wall) or 
near your desk, install wall command 
centers with bulletin boards, wall pock-
ets for papers, and shelving.
• Employ office storage carts with draw-
ers on wheels to instantly add storage 
and improve efficiency. You can roll 
the cart back into a closet or corner 
after you’re done with it.
• Maximize your office wall space by us-
ing ﬂoor-to-ceiling shelving or book-
shelves instead of storage pieces that 
only go halfway up the wall. This can 
double your amount of storage!
• Consider dedicating a drawer in your 
desk as your inbox to keep the top of 
your desk free from papers at all times.
• House a large bin on wheels next to 
your desk for tossing items that can be 
sorted later to keep your work area free 
from clutter.
• Install cube or cubby storage pieces 
along the wall or in a cabinet (you 
might have to remove a shelf) for easy 
compartmental storage for little stuff.
• Assess your trouble spots. Look 
around your desk and office area and 
determine what items do not have a 
home. It helps to think of these items 
as they relate to a speciﬁc office task 
and then create organized storage 
solutions grouped around speciﬁc 
tasks—printer, printer supplies, paper 
supplies, etc. all organized together, 
for example.
• Use rectangular planter boxes in a cab-
inet or on a shelf to stack notebooks, 
folders, and ﬁles you can quickly 
access.
• Set an old dresser or hutch next to a 
desk for additional storage for office 
supplies, books, and ﬁles. For a quick 
update, add a fresh coat of paint.


MULTI-

Count yourself lucky if you have a room in your 
home you and your family are able to use for 
multiple purposes. However, you might not 
feel so lucky about all the supplies, equipment, 
tools, and other items that relate to the tasks 
and activities done within this room—especially 
when they’re an unorganized mess.
In this section, I share a multipurpose room 
that serves as a family room, a playroom, a craft 
room, and an office—all in one space. By des-
ignating each corner of the room for a speciﬁc 
task and creating multipurpose storage solu-
tions, you can keep your multipurpose room 
from feeling messy and cluttered.

COUNTERSPACE OPTIONS
If your room is large enough to hold a 
countertop, employ small jars, bowls, 
and baskets to combat clutter there. 
Consider, too, adding shelves above the 
counter to make the most of your space.
STORAGE OTTOMAN COFFEE TABLE
If your multipurpose room has space for 
a lounge area, add a large storage otto-
man to hold blankets and pillows and do 
double-duty as a coffee table.
HIDDEN STORAGE
Add doors to open cabinets to give your 
room hidden storage options. This is espe-
cially key in multipurpose spaces because 
of the different tasks and activities the area 
is used for. Designate bins and baskets for 
speciﬁc supplies and tuck them in the cabi-
net for quick cleanup.
TABLE AND STORAGE OTTOMANS
A table in the center of a multipurpose
room can be the center of the activity. Place a 
tray on the tabletop in which to toss items, or 
add a decorative vase if you want to keep this 
area clutter free. Use ottomans to replace the 
chairs and provide seating as well as storage.

Inexpensive Built-Ins
DIY PROJECT #16
I opted for unﬁnished stock kitchen cabinets from my local big-box home improvement store as 
the base of my built-ins. I used one large double-door base cabinet, two single-door bases, and 
one double-door upper cabinet. A quick coat of paint is all they needed to look more custom- 
designed.
MATERIALS
If you’ve always wanted the look and functionally of custom-designed built-ins but thought 
they were out of your budget, this project is for you. By using inexpensive premade stock kitch-
en cabinets and planning your space around standard-width sizes of MDF board/wood (so no 
special cuts are needed), you’ll be pleasantly surprised how affordable built-ins can be!

I used the wall as the backing of the cabinets instead of 
adding more wood there to save even more money. More 
paint helped create a consistent, uniﬁed look.

daily household essentials like rubber 
bands, safety pins, scissors, and straight

KID’S CRAFT SUPPLIES DRAWER
Set aside one drawer speciﬁcally for

Closed Door Storage
DIY PROJECT #17
I started by removing the inside shelves and 
all the contents of my cabinet.
My cabinet had trim with a rounded edge 
around the frame. That wouldn’t be ﬂush 
with the front and sides of the doors I 
wanted to add, so I removed it with a small 
crowbar.
MATERIALS
Built-in bookshelves are wonderful if you have the space and budget to create them. But if you 
have too many open shelving systems in a room, the area can start to feel cluttered, even if 
they’re all neatly organized. By adding cabinet doors to an existing open cabinet (as I’ll show 
you here), built-in shelving, or even a bookshelf, you can close the door on clutter.

I added new trim with square edges using ﬁnishing 
nails. I patched the nail holes with spackle, and when the 
spackle was dry, I added a coat of primer.
I measured my cabinet opening to ﬁnd the size I needed 
for my cabinet doors and cut them out of MDF board 
to ensure the side edges were smooth and the doors 
wouldn’t warp over time. When measuring the cabinet 
frame to get the size I needed for my cabinet doors, I 
planned that the hinges and trim edge would be ﬂush 
when the doors were opened. 
I installed the hinges, attached the doors to the cabinet, 
and gave everything a coat of paint.
Now this area of my multipurpose room still has the feel 
of a custom-built piece, but the cabinet doors give me 
the option of closing away what’s behind them. For more

GIFT WRAPPING STATION
CLOSET RODS
If you keep rolls of wrapping paper on 
hand, you might ﬁnd that standing them 
up in a corner can lead to wrinkled or torn

rods. Use adjustable rods, or cut them to ﬁt 
your space. Hang them with the open part 
of the brackets all facing up so you can pop 
out the rod easily when you need to.
MAGAZINE HOLDERS
Tucked into my cabinet, magazine holders 
keep gift bags and wrapping paper neat

WIRE BASKETS
Wire baskets enable you to organize items 
neatly yet still the basket contents. By using

is a quick and easy way to create more storage 
space. Inside, I turned mail organizers on their 
side to create slotted compartments for note 
cards, envelopes, and other paper storage.

TRICK #1
REPURPOSE INEXPENSIVE BEAD ORGANIZERS
Try this quick trick when you need to drawer storage: instead of purchasing pricier hardware storage organizers, opt 
for inexpensive plastic bead organizers instead. You may leave the lid on if you have several to stack in a space. Or cut 
off the lid for easily accessible open storage compartments. Use a small pair of sharp scissors to cut the plastic hinges. 
When the lid has been removed, you can cut the plastic even closer to the storage tray if you need to. Now you have 
the perfect storage solution for all your nails, screws, tacks, and other little hardware pieces.

RETHINK SCRAPBOOK PAPER
If you’ve been to a craft store lately, you might know how very many colors and patterns scrapbook paper comes in. 
For a quick and easy drawer liner, pick up a few pieces of thick cardstock scrapbook paper, cut it to ﬁt your drawers, 
and install using glue dots or double-sided tape. If you want, you can laminate the paper before installing it for extra 
durability and easier cleanup.

tips
• Opt for ﬂoor-to-ceiling storage pieces 
that ﬁll the whole wall to create the 
most storage.
• In the middle of the room, house ta-
bles, storage ottomans, or multitiered 
roller carts for ongoing projects.
• Choose baskets and bins that make 
the most of the height available inside 
cabinets or open shelving to increase 
your amount of storage.
• Use glass containers and canisters 
to organize the little stuff so you can 
instantly spot what you need.
• Select the same color and style of bas-
kets to help contain the little stuff and 
make the room look cohesive with all 
the different tasks performed there.
• Implement drawer storage under 
where the speciﬁc task will be done to 
organize all the supplies required for 
that task while keeping the open areas 
free of clutter.
• Assess your trouble spots. To deter-
mine what needs to be contained in 
a multipurpose space, make a list of 
four or ﬁve of your family’s greatest 
spatial needs that you currently lack. 
Draw your room on paper with to-scale 
measurements, and look for creative 
ways to incorporate these tasks into 
each corner and in the middle of the 
room. Start with the measurements of 
the furniture you have, or will have in 
the room, ﬁrst. Everything else will fall 
into place around those pieces, and 
you can calculate the measurements 
you need for storage and additional 
pieces.
• Incorporate furniture taking up space 
elsewhere your home in your multipur-
pose room if it has organizing poten-
tial. An old desk can become an office, 
a hutch can be transformed into a me-
dia center, or a table can be set in the 
center of the room for activities and 
eating. Paint these pieces the same 
color as your other storage pieces for a 
cohesive look.


GARAGE
It’s all too easy to let the garage become a 
catch-all for whatever you don’t want in your 
house, haphazardly tossing excess stuff into 
that out-of-the way space with no thought given 
to organization. Or you might have the oppo-
site problem—maybe your garage is complete-
ly empty and untapped for potential storage 
possibilities because you’re at a loss for how to 
come up with creative garage storage solutions.
Whether you’re looking to get organized and 
unclutter your garage or you have a bare ga-
rage begging for organization, in this section, 
you learn tips to address both extremes and dis-
cover how to create and inexpensive long-term 
organizing solutions that can inspire you to get 
your garage organized once and for all.

PEGBOARD TOY STORAGE
Pegboard isn’t just for tools. Getting toys and 
sports equipment off the garage ﬂoor and onto 
a pegboard storage wall is a great way to con-
trol garage clutter. Hang them on hooks placed 
low enough for kids to reach, and you create an 
easy-access activity station.
PEGBOARD TOOL STORAGE
Pegboard is an easy, inexpensive, and long-term 
solution for storing tools and other garage equip-
ment. Because of its compact design, pegboard can 
be a realistic solution even in very narrow spaces.

MOBILE TOOL STORAGE
In addition to corralling tools in the garage, chest-
style toolboxes can be used for craft or hobby sup-
ply storage or just about anything else you need to 
store. And because they’re set on wheels, you can 
move them around to your work area.
CLOSED STORAGE
Not all garage storage has to be out in the open. 
Storage cabinets and shelving are ideal for con-
taining items in the garage. These tall units ﬁll 
the wall space from the ﬂoor to the ceiling and are 
sold in shallow depths to ﬁt in narrow areas.

PEGBOARD
A quick coat of paint turns a sheet of 
pegboard installed on a garage wall into 
a clean and cohesive storage wall.
STORAGE CABINETS
Small drawer storage cabinets designed 
to hold nails, screws, nuts, and bolts 
don’t have to take up valuable space on 
your workbench. Hang the cabinet on a 
pegboard wall instead.
Galvanized pails 
hung on hooks are 
another option.
WIRE BINS
Hang wire bins of various sizes and 
shapes anywhere and everywhere you 
need to corral miscellaneous items in 
your garage.

Pegboard Storage Wall
DIY PROJECT #18
I only had a narrow space in the garage to 
work with and still have enough room for 
two cars to ﬁt as well, but the wall is rather 
large: 12 feet (3.5m) wide from the door on 
the left to the corner on the right and 8 feet 
(2.5m) tall.
I attached a 1×2-inch (2.5×5cm) board where 
I wanted the bottom shelf to be. This served 
as a support for the shelf and gave me some-
thing to which to secure the shelf. I then 
nailed the 1×6-inch (2.5×15cm) shelf board to 
the support. I attached the sides, two more 
1×6-inch (2.5×15cm) boards, nailing them to 
the 1×2-inch (2.5×5cm) support and also to 
the shelf.
MATERIALS
The garage often is home to lots of tools, gadgets, supplies, and equipment. With so much 
“stuff,” organization and storage can be a challenge. As this project shows, you don’t need a lot 
of space to create a smart solution for just about any area. This pegboard storage unit is only 
51⁄2 inches (14cm) deep. I designed and built it using 1×6-inch (2.5×15cm) pine boards.

PEGBOARD STORAGE WALL
I added more 1×2-inch (2.5×5cm) boards to support more 
shelves and to have a surface to which to nail the peg-
board: inside the frame next to the sides, where I planned 
to put two more 1×6-inch (2.5×15cm) shelves above and 
below the pegboards, down the center, and where the 
two panels met. Using two 4×8-foot (1.25×2.5m) pegboard 
panels, cutting one to ﬁt, I nail them to the supports.
I caulked the edges of the unit and painted the wall and 
the rest of the wood. (Caulking along the edges where 
the wood meets the wall makes the piece look more like 
a professionally crafted built-in unit.) To help keep the 
items on the top shelf in place, I added a ﬁnal 1×2-inch 
(2.5×5cm) board to the edge of the top shelf to serve as 
a lip.
The 1×2-inch (2.5×5cm) boards behind 
the pegboard hold it out from the wall 
so you can insert pegs and hooks into 
the pegboard. Don’t nail the pegboard 
to the wall, or you won’t be able to 
insert the pegs correctly.
You can use a pegboard for storing almost everything, 
and with so many unique pegboard hooks available, you 
can hang just about anything. This project isn’t limited 
to the garage. It could be used in a basement, closet, or 
anywhere else you have a spare wall and lots of smaller 
items to organize. For more how-to information and pho-
tos, visit thecreativityexchange.com/organizing-your-life.

TRICK #1 
MAKE A QUICK AND EASY MAGNETIC BOARD
Assemble an instant-fabric covered magnetic board by cutting a square or rectangular piece of metal sheeting (avail-
able at home improvement stores) and covering it with fabric. Cut your fabric a a bit larger than your sheet of metal 
(about 2 inches; 5cm) so you can wrap it around the edges and secure it on the back side. Place your fabric right side 
down on your work surface, and add the metal piece on top. Starting in the middle of one side, begin to evenly fold 
the fabric over the edge of the metal to the back side and use a hot glue gun to adhere the fabric to the back, being 
sure to pull the fabric taught and smooth. Nail the board to the pegboard wall in the garage, or insert the metal into a 
frame and hang inside your house. Use large magnets to attach clipboards, clips, pens, and other smaller items to the 
magnetic board.

TRICK #2 
CREATE CHALKBOARD LABELS
Making chalkboard labels to use in the garage (or anywhere!) is simple thanks to a can of spray paint and painter’s 
tape. Attach a long strip of painter’s tape to something you don’t mind getting paint on such as an old birdcage frame, 
spray the nonsticky side of the strip of tape with black ﬂat spray paint or chalkboard paint, and let it dry completely. 
When the tape is dry, you can cut your labels and attach then wherever you like. The painter’s tape, as opposed to 
packing tape, makes the label easier to remove later if you like. To write on the labels, use chalk or a chalk pen. (If you 
use chalk, slightly wet it ﬁrst and the letters will be bolder.)

tips
• Install pegboard or narrow shelving 
solutions on bare walls to hang tools, 
yard supplies, or auto equipment.
• Measure your cars when they’re parked 
in the garage to better see where you 
have wasted space and potential  
storage possibilities.
• Look at ways to maximize the garage 
walls from the ﬂoor all the way to the 
ceiling. Purchase narrow metal shelv-
ing, or construct your own narrow 
plywood shelving.
• Set stackable plastic or metal bins in 
a corner or by the door into the house 
for tossing little stuff.
• Attach hooks to the walls to hang met-
al buckets or baskets with handles for 
storing pet leashes and supplies, tool 
and craft supplies, or almost anything.
• Arrange cube or cubby storage pieces 
along the wall to provide compartmen-
tal storage for sporting equipment, pet 
supplies, or other smaller items.
• Assess your trouble spots. As you 
organize your garage, take a close look 
at what items need a dedicated storage 
spot. Similar to other areas in your 
home, group like items together  
when creating storage solutions—
gardening supplies together, tools 
together, household supplies together, 
etc. When you have these items divid-
ed into categories, you can see how 
much storage space you’ll need for the 
group, and you can begin to come up 
with long-term storage solutions for 
these items.
• Hang an old bulletin board or large 
frame converted into a bulletin board 
in the garage right next to the door 
going into the house for notes, mes-
sages, or lists.
• Repurpose an old narrow bookshelf or 
shelving unit taking up space else-
where in your home in the garage for 
storing bins or garage supplies.


THE REST OF 
YOUR LIFE
The same key elements and processes that go 
into successfully organizing your home apply 
to organizing the rest of your life, too. Instead 
of maximizing your space, however, think of 
organizing your life as maximizing your time. 
Instead of looking for areas of wasted physical 
space, look for wasted spots in your life need-
lessly taking up your time and energy. And as 
you purge items you no longer need or want 
from your home, purge those things in your life 
that are no longer important or serve a purpose.
The challenging part of this is that organizing 
the rest of your life isn’t as easy—nor as fast—as 
organizing your kitchen pantry, for example. 
However, if you change your focus and the way 
you think about organizing and throw away any 
preconceived notions and unrealistic visions of 
organizing perfection, you can start fresh and 
begin to look for realistic ways to get and stay 
organized in all areas of your life.

AN ORGANIZED LIFE
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
262
ONE THING AT A TIME
When you’re organizing your home, you know 
you need to resist the urge to compile a long and 
intimidating list of all the areas in that need to be 
organized. The same is true when you set about to 
organize your life.
Instead, focus on solving one problem at a time 
so you don’t get overwhelmed by all the issues 
and tasks you need to get in order. Just the 
thought of everything you need to get sorted and 
straightened can be enough to make you want 
to give up before you start. If you keep it simple, 
you stand a greater chance of succeeding because 
you reduce the intimidation such a large task can 
cause.
When you work on one problem at a time, you 
inadvertently create a chain reaction in other 
areas of your life. If you ﬁnd ways to better 
manage your time or purge things from your life 
that waste the most time, you create more time for 
other areas in your life.
IDENTIFY PROBLEM AREAS
An important element for successful organizing, 
whether it be in your home or your life, is stepping 
back and assessing your trouble spots. Without 
pinpointing the exact source of the problem, it’s 
hard to know what type of a solution you need to 
ﬁx it for the long term.
For example, instead of looking in general at ways 
to better manage your time, pinpoint the source 
of where you waste the most amount of time—
the laundry room, the office, etc. Then take an 
honest look at what speciﬁc tasks in those areas 
are draining your time so you can begin to ﬁnd a 
solution.
PURGING VERSUS TIME 
MANAGEMENT
When it comes to organizing your life, it’s only 
natural to assume better time management is the 
ﬁrst place to start. Managing your time efficiently 
is important, but the real solution is often found 
by purging things from your life that waste your 
time and, therefore, weigh you down.
So many of us try to ﬁt twice as much stuff into 
our days than we actually have time for. It’s just 
like trying to organize an overstuffed closet that 
contains twice as many clothes as available closet 
space. We won’t see results in the closet if we don’t 
get rid of clothes we no longer need. The same is 
true in your life. What can you take off your to-do 
list?
Organizing your life is not impossible. In fact, it’s very doable, and it’s probably a lot closer than you 
think.

LIVING THE LIFE YOU 
LOVE
Purging things from your life isn’t an easy task, 
especially when you have a busy family and feel 
pressure to take on more than you have time to do. 
Oftentimes, we take on things out of obligation 
or because it’s hard to say no, which compounds 
that feeling of being out of control of our life. 
Something has to give!
Implementing a strategy for determining what 
you should take on and when you need to say no 
makes all the difference—and it makes purging so 
much easier.
If you take on tasks you enjoy and eliminate 
those things that drain you and no longer serve 
a purpose in your life, you’ll ﬁnd you have 
more enthusiasm, energy, and time. And most 
importantly, you’ll be happier. Asking yourself Do 
I love it? when looking at what to purge, or Will 
I love it? when asked to take on something is the 
best way to assess what needs to stay and what 
needs to go. If the answer to either question is no, 
you can walk away.
You purge your closets and home based on what 
pieces you love and don’t love, but for some 
reason, it’s not always obvious that you need to 
make that same connection when it comes to 
organizing your life. Your time is precious, and 
your happiness is the primary goal. Focusing on 
what makes you happy should be the basis for how 
you go about getting your life organized.
PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER
As you begin to look at ways to organize your 
life, remember to tackle one problem at a time 
by assessing your trouble spots and clearly 
identifying the source of the problem areas—it’s 
impossible to come up with solutions if you don’t 
ﬁrst identify what’s wrong. Instead of looking 
for ways to make more time for the stuff that 
ultimately weighs you down, focus your energy 
on assessing the value of what you’re doing and 
how you’re spending your time. Too often, what 
you feel or think is organizational problem in your 
life is actually more about taking on too much and 
spending too much of your limited time doing 
things you don’t love.
Organizing your life and living the life you love 
won’t happen overnight, but if you begin asking 
yourself Do I love it? or Will I love it? you’ll begin 
to see and feel that you are, in fact, in control. 
There’s a great relief that comes with knowing 
you ﬁnally have a realistic strategy and plan for 
getting organized.

TO-DO LISTS
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
266
With busy families and busy lives, keeping track 
of everything you need to do day in and day out 
can get overwhelming, and staying a step ahead of 
the chaos can be a challenge.
What’s more, if you’re not a “list person,” you 
might have the best intentions and start a to-do 
list … but then forget to update it, lose it, start a 
separate list, or let it get so out of control it’s no 
longer an aid in helping you get organized but 
rather something else you have to get in order.
It doesn’t have to be that way. By creating a 
customized to-do list that covers just about 
everything in your day or week, you can look 
ahead, think about what you need to do before the 
chaos hits, and better keep track of everything you 
need to keep track of. As a bonus, this advance 
planning helps you spot any problems or issues 
ahead of time.
MAKING MY LIST
Several years ago, I designed my own to-do 
list that included a section for all the tasks I 
anticipated I needed to get through during my 
day. I thought that if I was going to make myself 
use a list, it wouldn’t just be a partial list but rather 
a full and complete list that included everything I 
needed to do, buy, pick up, drop off, etc. The more 
value I could add to the list, the more I would rely 
on it—and actually use it.
I also told myself that I would do the list ahead of 
time either for the week or the day, depending how 
busy I was. At the end of the day, when I ﬁnally 
got caught up or had a moment to spare, I would 
update the list.
This way, I planned my day ahead of time, but I 
still had the list to be my guide and keep me on 
track and organized. This method has worked well 
for me.
MAKING YOUR LIST
The best way to make the most of a to-do list is to 
design your own list customized to the tasks you 
do during your days and weeks.
You can create your list on your computer using a 
blank word processing document, or you can keep 
it in a notebook or on your smartphone. It doesn’t 
have to be a fancy or pretty list, just something 
that helps you plot out your week or day.
For inspiration when designing your own to-do 
list, feel free to look at mine. It’s available for 
free download at thecreativityexchange.com/

customize my template by typing in your own 
section titles, or use the titles on my list if they

customize it later as you discover what works best 
for you and your family.

busy you’ll be.

PURGE AND DECLUTTER
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
270
Although necessary, purging and decluttering 
can be a difficult task. It’s far too easy to become 
attached to your stuff and not want to part with 
it—that’s likely what lead to the clutter and lack of 
organization in the ﬁrst place. Deciding what to 
keep and what to part with—especially those items 
you have an emotional or sentimental attachment 
to—can become overwhelming quickly.
The key to efficiently sorting and eliminating 
items you no longer need is establishing a system 
for determining what stays and what goes—
quickly and without the agony of indecision. 
If you set up a sort-and-purge routine monthly 
or seasonally, you’ll really see a decrease in the 
amount of “stuff” in your home and in your life.
In this section, I share my method of purging and 
decluttering.
FIRST SWEEP
For the ﬁrst sweep, you’ll need three large plastic 
storage bins, cardboard boxes, or trash bags. 
Designate two of them for what you normally do 
with your purged items—if you donate your items, 
designate one bin for donation; if you give away 
your items to a sister or family member, designate 
the bin for that. Designate the third bin for 
“uncertain” items.
Now do a ﬁrst sweep of your cabinet, closet, or 
room. During this ﬁrst pass, remove those items 
you have no attachment to, those items you don’t 
hesitate to put in the “get rid of” bin.
If you have to think about something for more 
than 10 seconds, set it aside in the “uncertain” 
bin for now and move on to the next item. You’ll 
revisit those uncertain items on the second sweep.

HOLPLQDWLQJ

SECOND SWEEP
After you’ve gone through your ﬁrst sweep, 
do a second sweep. This time, focus on those 
“uncertain” items you hesitated on the ﬁrst time. 
Often, these pieces are clothing, accessories, or 
other things you haven’t worn or used for years, 
yet they remain in your closet, taking up space. Or 
maybe they’re items of clothing (if you’re purging 
a closet) that no longer ﬁt or have sentimental 
value.
If you’re purging a closet, don’t stop to try on 
clothes now to determine if a piece needs to stay 
or go. This is just another opportunity for you 
to get sidetracked. Save trying on clothes for a 
different day. For now, toss any questionable items 
into the uncertain bin or a separate “try on” bin.
DEAL WITH THE  
STORAGE BINS
As soon as you’ve gone through the space two 
times, place the bins that contain items to get 
rid of or donate to someone else in your car for 
immediate drop-off. Or if you don’t have a car, 
place them by your front door or somewhere 
where you can deal with them quickly and not be 
tempted to let them linger.
Relocate the uncertain bin somewhere like an 
attic or basement—someplace far enough away so 
you won’t be tempted to revisit the items and put 
them back where they were before. If you can go a 
month or two without needing those items, you’ll 
be better able to admit to yourself that you can get 
rid of them permanently. If you do discover you 
really need an item in the bin, you still have it and 
can get it out of the bin.
After you have purged your home or closet the 
ﬁrst time using this method, begin your next sort-
and-purge session by going through the uncertain 
bin and make room for the new items you might 
want to place there.
MAKE IT A REGULAR 
ROUTINE
This method of purging and decluttering helps 
you get into a regular routine. Over time, you’ll 
see how this process can have a major impact on 
helping you get—and stay—organized.

PRINTABLE CLOSET  
ORGANIZATION WORKSHEET
Organizing closets can be hard enough. Make the task easier by ﬁrst planning out what you want to do 
in your closet by using this handy worksheet.
Determine what areas of your closet are 
wasted space or spots where you could create 
new organization opportunities. Circle these 
areas on your sketch. Then ask yourself:
 
•  What areas am I currently not  
maximizing?
 
•  Could I move any storage pieces currently 
in my closet to other areas if they work 
better somewhere else?
 
•  What hanging pieces could I move 
around or add to maximize the space 
available?
Go back to your closet and measure the areas 
you circled on your sketch. Write these dimen-
sions on your sketch.
Determine what color storage pieces will best 
coordinate with the trim and shelving in your 
closet. Note that if you choose any color other 
than white, dark brown, or black, you might 
pieces.
Search online for new storage pieces. Be sure 
to carefully check dimensions and look for 
color options that are close to your trim/ 
shelving color. Also try to make the most of 
your space available by choosing storage 
pieces that are functional and won’t leave you 
with any wasted space. Bookmark or list here 
the storage pieces you’re interested in:

Draw the potential new storage pieces in your 
sketch of your closet, and erase and move any 
existing storage changes you can make. This 
helps you come to a decision on what storage 
pieces you should purchase.
Purge your closet of any unwanted items. A 
good rule of thumb is if you haven’t worn it or 
used it for a year, get rid of it.
Instead of empting out your whole closet to 
begin your reorganization, work section by 
section, incorporating and ﬁlling new storage 
pieces as you go. This way you can step away 
from reorganizing for a day or two and not be 
tempted to just give up and put everything 
back where it was.
As you ﬁnish adding your new storage pieces, 
take note of areas where you could employ 
more baskets, bins, and other special smaller 
pieces to keep your closet organized—for good.
