Preface
What diﬀerential calculus, and, in general, analysis of the inﬁnite, might be
can hardly be explained to those innocent of any knowledge of it. Nor can we
here oﬀer a deﬁnition at the beginning of this dissertation as is sometimes
done in other disciplines. It is not that there is no clear deﬁnition of this
calculus; rather, the fact is that in order to understand the deﬁnition there
are concepts that must ﬁrst be understood. Besides those ideas in common
usage, there are also others from ﬁnite analysis that are much less common
and are usually explained in the course of the development of the diﬀerential
calculus. For this reason, it is not possible to understand a deﬁnition before
its principles are suﬃciently clearly seen.
In the ﬁrst place, this calculus is concerned with variable quantities.
Although every quantity can naturally be increased or decreased without
limit, still, since calculus is directed to a certain purpose, we think of some
quantities as being constantly the same magnitude, while others change
through all the stages of increasing and decreasing. We note this distinc-
tion and call the former constant quantities and the latter variables. This
characteristic diﬀerence is not required by the nature of things, but rather
because of the special question addressed by the calculus.
In order that this diﬀerence between constant quantities and variables
might be clearly illustrated, let us consider a shot ﬁred from a cannon with
a charge of gunpowder. This example seems to be especially appropriate to
clarify this matter. There are many quantities involved here: First, there is
the quantity of gunpowder; then, the angle of elevation of the cannon above
the horizon; third, the distance traveled by the shot; and, fourth, the length

vi
Preface
of time the shot is in the air. Unless the same cannon is used throughout
the experiment, we must also bring into our calculations the length of the
barrel and the weight of the shot. Here, we will not consider variations in the
cannon or the shot, lest we become entailed in very complicated questions.
Hence, if we always keep the same quantity of powder, the elevation of
the barrel will vary continuously with the distance traveled and the shot’s
duration of time in the air. In this case, the amount of powder, or the
force of the explosion, will be the constant quantity. The elevation of the
barrel, the distance traveled, and the time in the air should be the variable
quantities. If for each degree of elevation we were to deﬁne these things,
so that they may be noted for future reference, the changes in distance
and duration of the ﬂight arise from all of the diﬀerent elevations. There
is another question: Suppose the elevation of the barrel is kept the same,
but the quantity of powder is continuously changed. Then the changes that
occur in the ﬂight need to be deﬁned. In this case, the elevation will be the
constant, while the quantity of powder, the distance, and duration are the
variable quantities. Hence, it is clear that when the question is changed, the
quantities that are constant and those that are variables need to be noted.
At the same time, it must be understood from this that in this business
the thing that requires the most attention is how the variable quantities
depend on each other. When one variable changes, the others necessarily
are changed. For example, in the former case considered, the quantity of
powder remains the same, and the elevation is changed; then the distance
and duration of the ﬂight are changed. Hence, the distance and duration
are variables that depend on the elevation; if this changes, then the others
also change at the same time. In the latter case, the distance and duration
depend on the quantity of charge of powder, so that a change in the charge
must result in certain changes in the other variables.
Those quantities that depend on others in this way, namely, those that
undergo a change when others change, are called functions of these quanti-
ties. This deﬁnition applies rather widely and includes all ways in which one
quantity can be determined by others. Hence, if x designates the variable
quantity, all other quantities that in any way depend on x or are determined
by it are called its functions. Examples are x2, the square of x, or any other
powers of x, and indeed, even quantities that are composed with these pow-
ers in any way, even transcendentals, in general, whatever depends on x in
such a way that when x increases or decreases, the function changes. From
this fact there arises a question; namely, if the quantity x is increased or
decreased, by how much is the function changed, whether it increases or
decreases? For the more simple cases, this question is easily answered. If
the quantity x is increased by the quantity ω, its square x2 receives an
increase of 2xω + ω2. Hence, the increase in x is to the increase of x2 as ω
is to 2xω + ω2, that is, as 1 is to 2x + ω. In a similar way, we consider the
ratio of the increase of x to the increase or decrease that any function of x

receives. Indeed, the investigation of this kind of ratio of increments is not
only very important, but it is in fact the foundation of the whole of analysis
of the inﬁnite. In order that this may become even clearer, let us take up
again the example of the square x2 with its increment of 2xω + ω2, which
it receives when x itself is increased by ω. We have seen that the ratio here
is 2x + ω to 1. From this it should be perfectly clear that the smaller the
increment is taken to be, the closer this ratio comes to the ratio of 2x to
1. However, it does not arrive at this ratio before the increment itself, ω,
completely vanishes. From this we understand that if the increment of the
variable x goes to zero, then the increment of x2 also vanishes. However,
the ratio holds as 2x to 1. What we have said here about the square is to
be understood of all other functions of x; that is, when their increments
vanish as the increment of x vanishes, they have a certain and determinable
ratio. In this way, we are led to a deﬁnition of diﬀerential calculus: It is
a method for determining the ratio of the vanishing increments that any
functions take on when the variable, of which they are functions, is given a
vanishing increment. It is clearly manifest to those who are not strangers
to this subject that the true character of diﬀerential calculus is contained
in this deﬁnition and can be adequately deduced from it.
Therefore, diﬀerential calculus is concerned not so much with vanishing
increments, which indeed are nothing, but with the ratio and mutual pro-
portion. Since these ratios are expressed as ﬁnite quantities, we must think
of calculus as being concerned with ﬁnite quantities. Although the values
seem to be popularly discussed as deﬁned by these vanishing increments,
still from a higher point of view, it is always from their ratio that conclu-
sions are deduced. In a similar way, the idea of integral calculus can most
conveniently be deﬁned to be a method for ﬁnding those functions from the
knowledge of the ratio of their vanishing increments.
In order that these ratios might be more easily gathered together and
represented in calculations, the vanishing increments themselves, although
they are really nothing, are still usually represented by certain symbols.
Along with these symbols, there is no reason not to give them a certain
name. They are called diﬀerentials, and since they are without quantity,
they are also said to be inﬁnitely small. Hence, by their nature they are
to be so interpreted as absolutely nothing, or they are considered to be
equal to nothing. Thus, if the quantity x is given an increment ω, so that
it becomes x + ω, its square x2 becomes x2 + 2xω + ω2, and it takes the
increment 2xω + ω2. Hence, the increment of x itself, which is ω, has the
ratio to the increment of the square, which is 2xω+ω2, as 1 to 2x+ω. This
ratio reduces to 1 to 2x, at least when ω vanishes. Let ω = 0, and the ratio
of these vanishing increments, which is the main concern of diﬀerential
calculus, is as 1 to 2x. On the other hand, this ratio would not be true
unless that increment ω vanishes and becomes absolutely equal to zero.
Hence, if this nothing that is indicated by ω refers to the increment of

viii
Preface
the quantity x, since this has the ratio to the increment of the square x2
as 1 to 2x, the increment of the square x2 is equal to 2xω and for this
reason is also equal to zero. Although both of these increments vanish
simultaneously, this is no obstacle to their ratios being determined as 1
to 2x. With respect to this nothing that so far has been represented by
the letter ω, in diﬀerential calculus we use the symbol dx and call it the
diﬀerential of x, since it is the increment of the quantity x. When we put
dx for ω, the diﬀerential of x2 becomes 2x dx. In a similar way, it is shown
that the diﬀerential of the cube x3 will be equal to 3x2 dx. In general, the
diﬀerential of any quantity xn will be equal to nxn−1 dx. No matter what
other functions of x might be proposed, diﬀerential calculus gives rules for
ﬁnding its diﬀerential. Nevertheless, we must constantly keep in mind that
since these diﬀerentials are absolutely nothing, we can conclude nothing
from them except that their mutual ratios reduce to ﬁnite quantities. Thus,
it is in this way that the principles of diﬀerential calculus, which are in
agreement with proper reasoning, are established, and all of the objections
that are wont to be brought against it crumble spontaneously; but these
arguments retain their full rigor if the diﬀerentials, that is, the inﬁnitely
small, are not completely annihilated.
To many who have discussed the rules of diﬀerential calculus, it has
seemed that there is a distinction between absolutely nothing and a special
order of quantities inﬁnitely small, which do not quite vanish completely
but retain a certain quantity that is indeed less than any assignable quan-
tity. Concerning these, it is correctly objected that geometric rigor has been
neglected. Because these inﬁnitely small quantities have been neglected, the
conclusions that have been drawn are rightly suspected. Although these in-
ﬁnitely small quantities are conceived to be few in number, when even a
few, or many, or even an innumerable number of these are neglected, an
enormous error may result. There is an attempt wrongfully to refute this
objection with examples of this kind, whereby conclusions are drawn from
diﬀerential calculus in the same way as from elementary geometry. Indeed,
if these inﬁnitely small quantities, which are neglected in calculus, are not
quite nothing, then necessarily an error must result that will be the greater
the more these quantities are heaped up. If it should happen that the er-
ror is less, this must be attributed to a fault in the calculation whereby
certain errors are compensated by other errors, rather than freeing the cal-
culation from suspicion of error. In order that there be no compensating
one error by a new one, let me ﬁx ﬁrmly the point I want to make with
clear examples. Those quantities that shall be neglected must surely be
held to be absolutely nothing. Nor can the inﬁnitely small that is discussed
in diﬀerential calculus diﬀer in any way from nothing. Even less should this
business be ended when the inﬁnitely small is described by some with the
example wherein the tiniest mote of dust is compared to a huge mountain
or even to the whole terrestrial globe. If someone undertakes to calculate

Preface
ix
the magnitude of the whole terrestrial globe, it is the custom easily to grant
him an error not only of a single grain of dust, but of even many thousands
of these. However, geometric rigor shrinks from even so small an error,
and this objection would be simply too great were any force granted to it.
Then it is diﬃcult to say what possible advantage might be hoped for in
distinguishing the inﬁnitely small from absolutely nothing. Perhaps they
fear that if they vanish completely, then will be taken away their ratio, to
which they feel this whole business leads. It is avowed that it is impossi-
ble to conceive how two absolutely nothings can be compared. They think
that some magnitude must be left for them that can be compared. They are
forced to admit that this magnitude is so small that it is seen as if it were
nothing and can be neglected in calculations without error. Neither do they
dare to assign any certain and deﬁnite magnitude, even though incompre-
hensibly small. Even if they were assumed to be two or three times smaller,
the comparisons are always made in the same way. From this it is clear that
this magnitude gives nothing necessary for undertaking a comparison, and
so the comparison is not taken away even though that magnitude vanishes
completely.
Now, from what has been said above, it is clear that that comparison,
which is the concern of diﬀerential calculus, would not be valid unless the
increments vanish completely. The increment of the quantity x, which we
have been symbolizing by ω, has a ratio to the increment of the square x2,
which is 2xω + ω2, as 1 to 2x + ω. But this always diﬀers from the ratio
of 1 to 2x unless ω = 0, and if we do require that ω = 0, then we can truly
say that this ratio is exactly as 1 to 2x. In the meantime, it must be un-
derstood that the smaller the increment ω becomes, the closer this ratio is
approached. It follows that not only is it valid, but quite natural, that these
increments be at ﬁrst considered to be ﬁnite and even in drawings, if it is
necessary to give illustrations, that they be ﬁnitely represented. However,
then these increments must be conceived to become continuously smaller,
and in this way, their ratio is represented as continuously approaching a cer-
tain limit, which is ﬁnally attained when the increment becomes absolutely
nothing. This limit, which is, as it were, the ﬁnal ratio of those increments,
is the true object of diﬀerential calculus. Hence, this ratio must be consid-
ered to have laid the very foundation of diﬀerential calculus for anyone who
has a mind to contemplate these ﬁnal ratios to which the increments of the
variable quantities, as they continuously are more and more diminished,
approach and at which they ﬁnally arrive.
We ﬁnd among some ancient authors some trace of these ideas, so that
we cannot deny to them at least some conception of the analysis of the
inﬁnite. Then gradually this knowledge grew, but it was not all of a sudden
that it has arrived at the summit to which it has now come. Even now,
there is more that remains obscure than what we see clearly. As diﬀerential
calculus is extended to all kinds of functions, no matter how they are pro-

x
Preface
duced, it is not immediately known what method is to be used to compare
the vanishing increments of absolutely all kinds of functions. Gradually
this discovery has progressed to more and more complicated functions. For
example, for the rational functions, the ultimate ratio that the vanishing
increments attain could be assigned long before the time of Newton and
Leibniz, so that the diﬀerential calculus applied to only these rational func-
tions must be held to have been invented long before that time. However,
there is no doubt that Newton must be given credit for that part of diﬀer-
ential calculus concerned with irrational functions. This was nicely deduced
from his wonderful theorem concerning the general evolution of powers of
a binomial. By this outstanding discovery, the limits of diﬀerential calculus
have been marvelously extended. We are no less indebted to Leibniz insofar
as this calculus at that time was viewed as individual tricks, while he put
it into the form of a discipline, collected its rules into a system, and gave a
crystal-clear explanation. From this there followed great aids in the further
development of this calculus, and some of the open questions whose an-
swers were sought were pursued through certain deﬁnite principles. Soon,
through the studies of both Leibniz and the Bernoullis, the bounds of dif-
ferential calculus were extended even to transcendental functions, which
had in part already been discussed. Then, too, the foundations of integral
calculus were ﬁrmly established. Those who followed in the elaboration of
this ﬁeld continued to make progress. It was Newton who gave very com-
plete papers in integral calculus, but as to its ﬁrst discovery, which can
hardly be separated from the beginnings of diﬀerential calculus, it cannot
with absolute certainty be attributed to him. Since the greater part has yet
to be developed, it is not possible to say at this time that this calculus has
absolutely been discovered. Rather, let us with a grateful mind acknowl-
edge each one according to his eﬀorts toward its completion. This is my
judgment as to the attribution of glory for the discovery of this calculus,
about which there has been such heated controversy.
No matter what name the mathematicians of diﬀerent nations are wont
to give to this calculus, it all comes to this, that they all agree on this
outstanding deﬁnition. Whether they call the vanishing increments whose
ratios are under consideration by the name diﬀerentials or ﬂuxions, these
are always understood to be equal to zero, and this must be the true notion
of the inﬁnitely small. From this it follows that everything that has been
debated about diﬀerentials of the second and higher orders, and this has
been more out of curiosity then of usefulness, comes back to something
very clear, namely, that when everything vanishes together we must con-
sider the mutual ratio rather than the individual quantities. Since the ratio
between the vanishing increments of the functions is itself expressed by
some function, and if the vanishing increment of this function is compared
with others, the result must be considered as the second diﬀerential. In this
way, we must understand the development of diﬀerentials of higher orders,

in such a way that they always are seen to be truly ﬁnite quantities and
that this is the only proper way for them to be represented. At ﬁrst sight,
this description of analysis of the inﬁnite may seem, for the most part, both
shallow and extremely sterile, although that obscure notion of the inﬁnitely
small hardly oﬀers more. In truth, if the ratios that connect the vanishing
increments of any functions are clearly known, then this knowledge very of-
ten is of the utmost importance and frequently is so important in extremely
arduous investigations that without it almost nothing can be clearly un-
derstood. For instance, if the question concerns the motion of a shot ﬁred
from a cannon, the air resistance must be known in order to know what
the motion will be through a ﬁnite distance, as well as both the direction
of the path at the beginning and also the velocity, on which the resistance
depends. But this changes with time. However, the less distance the shot
travels, the less the variation, so that it is possible more easily to come to
knowledge of the true relationship. In fact, if we let the distance vanish,
since in that case both the diﬀerence in direction and change in velocity
also are removed, the eﬀect of resistance produced at a single point in time,
as well as the change in the path, can be deﬁned exactly. When we know
these instantaneous changes or, rather, since these are actually nothing,
their mutual relationship, we have gained a great deal. Furthermore, the
work of integral calculus is to study changing motion in a ﬁnite space. It is
my opinion that it is hardly necessary to show further the uses of diﬀeren-
tial calculus and analysis of the inﬁnite, since it is now suﬃciently noted,
if even a cursory investigation is made. If we want to study more carefully
the motion of either solids or ﬂuids, it cannot be accomplished without
analysis of the inﬁnite. Indeed, this science has frequently not been suf-
ﬁciently cultivated in order that the matter can be accurately explained.
Throughout all the branches of mathematics, this higher analysis has pen-
etrated to such an extent that anything that can be explained without its
intervention must be esteemed as next to nothing.
I have established in this book the whole of diﬀerential calculus, deriving
it from true principles and developing it copiously in such a way that noth-
ing pertaining to it that has been discovered so far has been omitted. The
work is divided into two parts. In the ﬁrst part, after laying the founda-
tions of diﬀerential calculus, I have presented the method for diﬀerentiating
every kind of function, for ﬁnding not only diﬀerentials of the ﬁrst order,
but also those of higher order, and those for functions of a single variable
as well as those involving two or more variables. In the second part, I have
developed very fully applications of this calculus both in ﬁnite analysis and
the study of series. In that part, I have also given a very clear explanation
of the theorem concerning maxima and minima. As to the application of
this calculus to the geometry of plane curves, I have nothing new to oﬀer,
and this is all the less to be required, since in other works I have treated
this subject so fully. Even with the greatest care, the ﬁrst principles of

xii
Preface
diﬀerential calculus are hardly suﬃciently developed that I should bring
them, as it were drawn from geometry, to this science. Here, everything is
kept within the bounds of pure analysis, so that in the explanation of the
rules of this calculus there is no need for any geometric ﬁgures.

Translator’s Introduction
In 1748 Euler published Introductio in Analysin Inﬁnitorum, which has
been translated as Introduction to Analysis of the Inﬁnite, in two books.
This can be thought of as Euler’s “precalculus.” In 1755 he published In-
stitutiones Calculi Diﬀerentialis. This came in two parts. The ﬁrst part is
the theory of diﬀerential calculus, while the second part is concerned with
applications of diﬀerential calculus. The ﬁrst part consists of the ﬁrst nine
chapters, with chapters ten through twenty-seven dedicated to the second
part. Here, I have translated the ﬁrst part, that is, the ﬁrst nine chapters,
from Latin into English. The remaining chapters must remain as a future
project.
The translation is based on Volume X of the ﬁrst series of the Opera Om-
nia, edited by Gerhard Kowalewski. I have incorporated in my translation
the corrections noted by Kowalewski.
Euler’s notation is remarkably modern. However, I have modernized his
notation is a few cases. For instance, he rather consistently wrote xx, which
I have changed to x2. For his l x, I have written ln x; for tang x, cosc x, I
have written tan x, csc x; and for cos x2, I have written cos2 x. I have also
modernized his notation for partial derivatives. For his “transcendental
quantities depending on a circle,” I have substituted “trigonometric quan-
tities.”

erous help. Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Claire, and my children

On Finite Diﬀerences
1.
From what we have said in a previous book1 about variables and func-
tions, it should be clear enough that as a variable changes, the values of
all functions dependent on that variable also change. Thus if a variable
quantity x changes by an increment ω, instead of x we write x + ω. Then
such functions of x as x2, x3, (a + x) /

x2 + a2
, take on new values. For
instance, x2 becomes x2 + 2xω + ω2; x3 becomes x3 + 3x2ω + 3xω2 + ω3;
(a + x) /

a2 + x2
is transformed into
a + x + ω
a2 + x2 + 2xω + ω2 .
This kind of change always occurs unless the function has only the appear-
ance of a function of a variable, while in reality it is a constant, for example,
x0. In this case the function remains constant no matter how the value of
x changes.
2.
Since these things are clear enough, we move now to those results
concerning functions upon which rests the whole of analysis of the inﬁnite.
Let y be any function of the variable x. Successively we substitute for x
the values of an arithmetic progression, that is, x, x + ω, x + 2ω, x + 3ω,
x + 4ω, . . . . We call the value of the function yI when x + ω is substituted
for x; likewise, yII is the value of the function when x + 2ω is substituted

for x. In a similar way we denote the value of the function by yIII, yIV,
yV, . . . , which we obtain when we substitute x + 3ω, x + 4ω, x + 5ω, . . . .
The correspondence between these values is as follows:
x,
x + ω,
x + 2ω,
x + 3ω,
x + 4ω,
x + 5ω,
. . . ,
y,
yI,
yII,
yIII,
yIV,
yV,
. . . .
3.
Just as the arithmetic series x, x + ω, x + 2ω, . . . can be continued to
inﬁnity, so the series that depends on the function y: y, yI, yII, . . . can be
continued to inﬁnity, and its nature will depend on the properties of the
function y. Thus if y = x or y = ax + b, then the series y, yI, yII, . . . is also
arithmetic. If y = a/ (bx + c), the resulting series will be harmonic. Finally,
if y = ax, we will have a geometric series. Furthermore, it is impossible to
ﬁnd any series that does not arise from some such function. We usually call
such a function of x, because of the series from which it comes, the general
term of that series. Since every series formed according to some rule has a
general term, so conversely, the series arises from some function of x. This
is usually treated at greater length in a discussion of series.
4. Here we will pay special attention to the diﬀerences between successive
terms of the series y, yI, yII, yIII, . . . . In order that we become familiar with
the nature of diﬀerentials, we will use the following notation:
yI −y = ∆y,
yII −yI = ∆yI,
yIII −yII = ∆yII,
. . . .
We express the increment by ∆y, which the function y undergoes when we
substitute x + ω for x, where ω takes any value we wish. In the discussion
of series it is usual to take ω = 1, but here it is preferable to leave the value
general, so that it can be arbitrarily increased or decreased. We usually
call this increment ∆y of the function y its diﬀerence. This is the amount
by which the following value yI exceeds the original value y, and we al-
ways consider this to be an increment, although frequently it is actually a
decrement, since the value may be negative.
5.
Since yII is derived from y, if instead of x we write x + 2ω, it is clear
that we obtain the same result also if we ﬁrst put x + ω for x and then
again x + ω for x. It follows that yII is derived from yI if we write x + ω
instead of x. We now see that ∆yI is the increment of yI that we obtain
when x + ω is substituted for x. Hence, in like manner, ∆yI is called the
diﬀerence of yI. Likewise, ∆yII is the diﬀerence of yII, or its increment,
which is obtained by putting x + ω instead of x. Furthermore, ∆yIII is
the diﬀerence, or increment, of yIII, and so forth. With this settled, from
the series of values of y, namely, y, yI, yII, yIII, . . . , we obtain a series of
diﬀerences ∆y, ∆yI, ∆yII, . . . , which we ﬁnd by subtracting each term of
the previous series from its successor.

6.
Once we have found the series of diﬀerences, if we again take the dif-
ference of each term and its successor, we obtain a series of diﬀerences of
diﬀerences, which are called second diﬀerences. We can most conveniently
represent these by the following notation:
∆∆y = ∆yI −∆y,
∆∆yI = ∆yII −∆yI,
∆∆yII = ∆yIII −∆yII,
∆∆yIII = ∆yIV −∆yIII,
. . . .
We call ∆∆y the second diﬀerence of y, ∆∆yI the second diﬀerence of
yI, and so forth. In a similar way, from the second diﬀerences, if we once
more take their diﬀerences, we obtain the third diﬀerences, which we write
as ∆3y, ∆3yI, . . . . Furthermore, we can take the fourth diﬀerences ∆4y,
∆4yI, . . . , and even higher, as far as we wish.
7.
Let us represent each of these series of diﬀerences by the following
scheme, in order that we can more easily see their respective relationships:
Arithmetic Progression:
x,
x + ω,
x + 2ω,
x + 3ω,
x + 4ω,
x + 5ω,
. . .
Values of the Function:
y,
yI,
yII,
yIII,
yIV,
yV,
. . .
First Diﬀerences:
∆y,
∆yI,
∆yII,
∆yIII,
∆yIV,
. . .
Second Diﬀerences:
∆∆y,
∆∆yI,
∆∆yII,
∆∆yIII,
. . .
Third Diﬀerences:
∆3y,
∆3yI,
∆3yII,
. . .
Fourth Diﬀerences:
∆4y,
∆4yI,
. . .

1. On Finite Diﬀerences
Fifth Diﬀerences:
∆5y,
. . .
Each of these series comes from the preceding series by subtracting each
term from its successor. Hence, no matter what function of x we substitute
for y, it is easy to ﬁnd each of the series of diﬀerences, since the values yI,
yII, yIII, . . . are easily found from the deﬁnition of the function.
8.
Let y = x, so that yI = xI = x + ω, yII = xII = x + 2ω, and so
forth. When we take the diﬀerences, ∆x = ω, ∆xI = ω, ∆xII = ω, . . . , the
result is that all of the ﬁrst diﬀerences of x are constant, so that all of the
second diﬀerences vanish, as do the third diﬀerences and all those of higher
orders. Since ∆x = ω, it is convenient to use the notation ∆x instead of ω.
Since we are assuming that the successive values x, xI, xII, xIII, . . . form
an arithmetic progression, the diﬀerences ∆x, ∆xI, ∆xII, . . . are constants
and mutually equal. It follows that ∆∆x = 0, ∆3x = 0, ∆4x = 0, and so
forth.
9.
We have assumed that the successive values of x are terms of an arith-
metic progression, so that the values of its ﬁrst diﬀerences are constant and
its second and succeeding diﬀerences vanish. Although the choice is freely
ours to make among all possible progressions, still we usually choose the
progression to be arithmetic, since it is both the simplest and easiest to
understand, and also it has the greatest versatility, in that x can assume
absolutely any value. Indeed, if we give ω either negative or positive values
in this series, the values of x will always be real numbers. On the other
hand, if the series we have chosen is geometric, there is no place for neg-
ative values. For this reason the nature of functions y is best determined
from the values of x chosen from an arithmetic progression.

Just as ∆y = yI −y, so all the higher diﬀerences can also be deﬁned
from the terms of the ﬁrst series: y, yI, yII, yIII, . . . . Since
∆yI = yII −yI,
we have
∆∆y = yII −2yI + y
and
∆∆yI = yIII −2yII + yI.
Furthermore,
∆3y = ∆∆yI −∆∆y = yIII −3yII + 3yI −y;

in like manner,
∆4y = yIV −4yIII + 6yII −4yI + y
and
∆5y = yV −5yIV + 10yIII −10yII + 5yI −y.
We observe that the numerical coeﬃcients of these formulas are the same as
those of the binomial expansion. Insofar as the ﬁrst diﬀerence is determined
by the ﬁrst two terms of the series y, yI, yII, yIII, . . . , the second diﬀerence
is determined by three terms, the third is determined by four terms, and
so forth. It follows that when we know the diﬀerences of all orders of y,
likewise, diﬀerences of all orders of yI, yII, . . . are deﬁned.
11.
It follows that for any function, with any values of x and any diﬀer-
ences ω, we can ﬁnd its ﬁrst diﬀerence as well as its higher diﬀerences. Nor
is it necessary to compute more terms of the series of the values of y, since
we obtain the ﬁrst diﬀerence ∆y when for the function y we substitute
x + ω for x and from this value yI we subtract the function y. Likewise the
second diﬀerence ∆∆y is obtained from the ﬁrst diﬀerence ∆y by substi-
tuting x + ω for x to obtain ∆yI, and then subtracting ∆y from ∆yI. In
a similar way we get the third diﬀerence ∆3y from the second diﬀerence
∆∆y by putting x + ω for x and then subtracting. In the same way we
obtain the fourth diﬀerence ∆4y and so forth. Provided that we know the
ﬁrst diﬀerence of any function, we can ﬁnd the second, third, and all of
the following diﬀerences, since the second diﬀerence of y is nothing but the
ﬁrst diﬀerence of the ﬁrst diﬀerence ∆y, and the third diﬀerence is nothing
but the ﬁrst diﬀerence of the second diﬀerence ∆∆y, and so forth.
12.
If a function y is the sum of two or more functions, as for example
y = p+q +r +· · · , then, since yI = pI +qI +rI +· · · , we have the diﬀerence
∆y = ∆p + ∆q + ∆r + · · · .
Likewise,
∆∆y = ∆∆p + ∆∆q + ∆∆r + · · · .
It follows that if a function is the sum of other functions, then the com-
putation of its diﬀerences is just as easy. However, if the function y is the
product of two functions p and q, then, since
yI = pIqI
and
pI = p + ∆p

6
1. On Finite Diﬀerences
and
qI = q + ∆q,
we have
pIqI = pq + p∆q + q∆p + ∆p∆q,
so that
∆y = p∆q + q∆p + ∆p∆q.
Hence, if p is a constant equal to a, since ∆a = 0 and the function y = aq,
the ﬁrst diﬀerence ∆y equals a∆q. In a similar way the second diﬀerence
∆∆y equals a∆∆q, the third diﬀerence ∆3y equals a∆3q, and so forth.
13.
Since every polynomial is the sum of several powers of x, we can
ﬁnd all of the diﬀerences of polynomials, provided that we know how to
ﬁnd the diﬀerences of these powers. For this reason we will investigate the
diﬀerences of powers of x in the following examples.
Since x0 = 1, we have ∆x0 = 0, because x0 does not change when x
changes to x + ω.
Also, since as we have seen, ∆x = ω and ∆∆x = 0, all of the following
diﬀerences vanish. Since these things are clear, we begin with the second
power of x.
Example 1. Find the diﬀerences of all orders of x2.
Since here y = x2, we have yI = (x + ω)2, so that
∆y = 2ωx + ω2,
and this is the ﬁrst diﬀerence. Now, since ω is a constant, we have ∆∆y =
2ω2 and ∆3y = 0, ∆4y = 0, . . . .
Example 2. Find the diﬀerences of all orders of x3.
Let y = x3. Since yI = (x + ω)3, we have
∆y = 3ωx2 + 3ω2x + ω3,
which is the ﬁrst diﬀerence. Then, since ∆x2 = 2ωx+ω2, we have ∆3ωx2 =
6ω2x + 3ω3, ∆3ω2x = 3ω3, and ∆ω3 = 0. We put it all together to obtain
∆∆y = 6ω2x + 6ω3
and
∆3y = 6ω3.
The diﬀerences of higher order vanish.

1. On Finite Diﬀerences

Example 3. Find the diﬀerences of all orders of x4.
Let y = x4. Since yI = (x + ω)4 , we have
∆y = 4ωx3 + 6ω2x2 + 4ω3x + ω4,
which is the ﬁrst diﬀerence. Then, from what we have already found,
∆4ωx3 = 12ω2x2 + 12ω3x + 4ω4,
∆6ω2x2 = 12ω3x + 6ω4,
∆4ω3x = 4ω4,
∆ω4 = 0.
When these are combined, we have the second diﬀerence
∆∆y = 12ω2x2 + 24ω3x + 14ω4.
Furthermore, since
∆12ω2x2 = 24ω3x + 12ω4,
∆24ω3x = 24ω4,
∆14ω4 = 0,
we obtain the third diﬀerence
∆3y = 24ω3x + 36ω4.
Finally, we have the fourth diﬀerence
∆4y = 24ω4,
and since this is constant, all diﬀerences of higher order vanish.
Example 4. Find the diﬀerences of all orders of xn.
Let y = xn. Since yI = (x + ω)n , yII = (x + 2ω)n , yIII = (x + 3ω)n , . . . ,
the expanded powers are as follows:
y = xn,
yI = xn + n

From these results we use subtraction to derive

1 · 2 · 3 · 4
36ω4xn−4

Then
∆4y = n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3) ω4xn−4 + · · · .
14. In order that we may more easily see the law by which these diﬀerences
of powers of x are formed, let us for the sake of brevity use the following:
A = n
1 ,
B = n (n −1)
1 · 2

C = n (n −1) (n −2)
1 · 2 · 3

D = n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3)

,
E = n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3) (n −4)
1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5
,
. . . .
We will use the following table for each of the diﬀerences:

Each number in a row of the table is found by taking the sum of the
preceding number in that row and the number directly above that preceding
number and multiplying that sum by the exponent on ∆. For example, in
the row for ∆5y the number 16,800 is found by taking the sum of the
preceding 1800 and the 1560 in the preceding row to obtain 3360, which is
multiplied by 5.

1. On Finite Diﬀerences
15.
With the aid of this table we can write each of the diﬀerences of the
powers y = xn as follows:
∆y = Aωxn−1 + Bω2xn−2 + Cω3xn−3 + Dω4xn−4 + · · · ,
∆2y = 2Bω2xn−2 + 6Cω3xn−3 + 14Dω4xn−4 + · · · ,
∆3y = 6Cω3xn−3 + 36Dω4xn−4 + 150Eω5xn−5 + · · · ,
∆4y = 24Dω4xn−4 + 240Eω5xn−5 + 1560Fω6xn−6 + · · · .
In general, the diﬀerence of order m of the power xn, that is ∆my, is
expressed in the following way.
Let
I = n (n −1) (n −2) · · · (n −m + 1)
1 · 2 · 3 · · · m

K = n −m
m + 1 I,
L = n −m −1

Then we let

With these deﬁnitions we can write
∆my = αIωmxn−m + βKωm+1xn−m−1 + γLωm+2xn−m−2 + · · · .

1. On Finite Diﬀerences
11
This result follows immediately from all of the diﬀerences of y, yI, yII,
yIII, . . . .
16. From what we have seen it is clear that if the exponent n is a positive
integer, sooner or later we obtain a constant diﬀerence, and thereafter all
diﬀerences vanish. Thus we have
∆.x = ω,
∆2.x2 = 2ω2,
∆3.x3 = 6ω3,
∆4.x4 = 24ω4,
and ﬁnally,
∆n.xn = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · nωn
(see paragraph 146 for an explanation of this notation). It follows that every
polynomial ﬁnally arrives at a constant diﬀerence. For instance, the linear
function of x, ax+b, has for a ﬁrst diﬀerence the constant aω. The quadratic
function ax2 + bx + c has for second diﬀerence the constant 2aω2. A third-
degree polynomial has its third diﬀerence constant; the fourth degree has
its fourth diﬀerence constant, and so forth.
17.
The method whereby we ﬁnd the diﬀerences of powers xn can be
further extended to exponents that are negative, a fraction, or even an
irrational number. For the sake of clarity we will discuss only the ﬁrst
diﬀerences of powers with these kinds of exponents, since the law for second
and higher diﬀerences is not so easily seen. Let
∆.x = ω,
∆.x2 = 2ωx + ω2,
∆.x3 = 3ωx2 + 3ω2x + ω3,
∆.x4 = 4ωx3 + 6ω2x2 + 4ω3x + ω4,
. . . .

12
1. On Finite Diﬀerences
In a similar way we let
∆.x−1 = −ω
x2 + ω2
x3 −ω3

∆.x−2 = −2ω
x3 + 3ω2
x4 −4ω3

+ · · · ,
∆.x−4 = −4ω
x5 + 10ω2

We continue in the same way for the rest. For fractions we have
∆.x1/2 =

18.
It should be clear that if the exponent is not a positive integer, then
these diﬀerences will progress without limit, that is, there will be an inﬁnite
number of terms. Nevertheless, these same diﬀerences can be expressed by
a ﬁnite expression. If we let y = x−1 = 1/x, then yI = 1/ (x + ω), so that
∆.x−1 = ∆. 1
x =
1
x + ω −1
x.
Hence, if the fraction 1/ (x + ω) is expressed as a series, then we obtain the
inﬁnite expression we saw before. In a similar way we have
∆.x−2 = ∆. 1
x2 =
1
(x + ω)2 −1
x2 .
Furthermore, for irrational expressions we have
∆.√x =
√
x + ω −√x
and
∆. 1
√x =

√x + ω −1

13
If these formulas are expressed as series in the usual way, we will obtain
the expressions found above.
19. In this same way, diﬀerences of functions, either rational or irrational,
can be found. If, for example, we wish to ﬁnd the ﬁrst diﬀerence of the
fraction 1/

a2 + x2
, then we let y = 1/


, and since
yI =

we have
∆y = ∆
1
a2 + x2 =
1
a2 + x2 + 2ωx + ω2 −

a2 + x2 ,
and this expression can be converted into an inﬁnite series.
We let a2 + x2 = P and 2ωx + ω2 = Q. Then

P + Q = 1

Diﬀerences of irrational functions can be expressed by similar series.
If we let y =
√
a2 + x2, and since
yI =

a2 + x2 + 2ωx + ω2,
we let a2 + x2 = P and 2ωx + ω2 = Q, then

From this we gather the fact that the diﬀerence of any function of x, which
we call y, can be put into this form, so that
∆y = Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + Sω4 + · · · ,
where P, Q, R, S, . . . are certain functions of x that in any case can be
deﬁned in terms of the function y.
21.
We do not exclude from this form of expression even the diﬀerences
of transcendental functions, as will clearly appear from the following ex-
amples.
Example 1. Find the ﬁrst diﬀerence of the natural logarithm of x.
Let y = ln x. Since yI = ln (x + ω) , we have

Let sin x = y. Then yI = sin (x + ω), so that
∆y = yI −y = sin (x + ω) −sin x.
Now,
sin (x + ω) = cos ω · sin x + sin ω · cos x,
and we have shown4 that
cos ω = 1 −ω2

When we substitute these series we obtain

120 cos x −· · · .
Example 4. In a unit circle, to ﬁnd the diﬀerence of the cosine of the arc

Let y = cos x. Then since yI = cos (x + ω), we have
yI = cos ω cos x −sin ω sin x
and
∆y = cos ω cos x −sin ω sin x −cos x.
From the series referenced above we obtain
∆. cos x = −ω sin x −ω2
2 cos x −ω3

22.
Since any function of x, which we call y, whether it is algebraic or
transcendental, has a diﬀerence of the form
∆y = Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + Sω4 + · · · ,
if we take the diﬀerence again, it is clear that the second diﬀerence of y has
the form
∆2y = Pω2 + Qω3 + Rω4 + · · · .

16
1. On Finite Diﬀerences
In a similar way the third diﬀerence will be
∆3y = Pω3 + Qω4 + Rω5 + · · · ,
and so forth.
We should note that these letters P, Q, R, . . . do not stand for deter-
mined values, nor does the same letter in diﬀerent diﬀerences denote the
same function of x. Indeed, we use the same letters lest we run out of
symbols.
Furthermore, these forms of diﬀerences should be carefully noted, since
they are very useful in the analysis of the inﬁnite.
23.
According to the method we are using, the ﬁrst diﬀerence of any
function is found, and from it we ﬁnd the diﬀerences of the successive
orders. Indeed, from the values of successive functions of y, namely, yI, yII,
yIII, yIV, . . . , we ﬁnd in turn diﬀerences of y of any order. We recall that
yI = y + ∆y,
yII = y + 2∆y + ∆2y,
yIII = y + 3∆y + 3∆2y + ∆3y,
yIV = y + 4∆y + 6∆2y + 4∆3y + ∆4y,
and so forth, where the coeﬃcients arise from the binomial expansion. Since
yI, yII, yIII, . . . are values of y that arise when we substitute for x the
successive values x + ω, x + 2ω, x + 3ω, . . . , we can immediately assign the
value of y(n), which is produced if in place of x we write x + nω. The value
obtained is
y + n
1 ∆y + n (n −1)
1 · 2
∆2y + n (n −1) (n −2)
1 · 2 · 3
∆3y + · · · .
Furthermore, values of y can be obtained even if n is a negative integer.
Thus, if instead of x we put x −ω, the function y is in the form

If instead of x we put x −2ω, the function y becomes
y −2∆y + 3∆2y −4∆3y + 5∆4y −· · · .
24.
We will add a few things about the inverse problem. That is, if we
are given the diﬀerence of some function, we would like to investigate the
function itself. Since this is generally very diﬃcult and frequently requires
analysis of the inﬁnite, we will discuss only some of the easier cases. First of

all, proceeding backwards, if we have found the diﬀerence for some function
and that diﬀerence is now given, we can, in turn, exhibit that function
from which the diﬀerence came. Thus, since the diﬀerence of the function
ax + b is aω, if we are asked for the function whose diﬀerence is aω, we can
immediately reply that the function is ax + b, since the constant quantity
b does not appear in the diﬀerence, so we are free to choose any value for
b. It is always the case that if the diﬀerence of a function P is Q, then the
function P + A, where A is any constant, also has Q as its diﬀerence. It
follows that if this diﬀerence Q is given, a function from which this came is
P +A. Since A is arbitrary, the function does not have a determined value.
25. We call that desired function, whose diﬀerence is given, the sum. This
name is appropriate, since a sum is the operation inverse to diﬀerence, but
also since the desired function really is the sum of all of the antecedent
values of the diﬀerence. Just as
yI = y + ∆y
and
yII = y + ∆y + ∆yI,
if the values of y are continued backwards in such a way that what x −ω
corresponds to is written as yI, and yII preceding this, and also yIII, yIV,
yV, . . . , and if we form the retrograde series with their diﬀerences
yV,
yIV,
yIII,
yII,
yI,
y
and
∆yV,
∆yIV,
∆yIII,
∆yII,
∆yI,
then y = ∆yI + yI. Since yI = ∆yII + yII and yII = ∆yIII + yIII, we have
y = ∆yI + ∆yII + ∆yIII + ∆yIV + ∆yV + · · · .
Thus the function y, whose diﬀerence is ∆y, is the sum of the values of
the antecedent diﬀerences, which we obtain when instead of x we write the
antecedent values x −ω, x −2ω, x −3ω, . . . .
26.
Just as we used the symbol ∆to signify a diﬀerence, so we use the
symbol Σ to indicate a sum. For example, if z is the diﬀerence of the
function y, then ∆y = z. We have previously discussed how to ﬁnd the
diﬀerence z if y is given. However, if z is given and we want to ﬁnd its
sum y, we let y = Σz, and from the equation z = ∆y, working backwards,
we obtain the equation y = Σz, where an arbitrary constant can be added
for the reason already discussed. From the equation z = ∆y, if we invert,
we also obtain y = Σz + C. Now, since the diﬀerence of ay is a∆y = az,

18
1. On Finite Diﬀerences
we have Σaz = ay, provided that a is a constant. Since ∆x = ω, we have
Σω = x+C and Σaω = ax+C; since ω is a constant, we have Σω2 = ωx+C,
Σω3 = ω2 + C, and so forth.
27.
If we invert the diﬀerences of powers of x which we previously found,
we have Σω = x and from this Σ1 = x/ω. Then we have
Σ

2ωx + ω2
= x2,
so that
Σx = x2
2ω −Σω

Furthermore,
Σ

3ωx2 + 3ω2x + ω3

or
3ωΣx2 + 3ω2Σx + ω3Σ1 = x3,
so that
Σx2 = x3
3ω −ωΣx −ω2
3 Σ1,
and so
Σx2 = x3
3ω −x2
2 + ωx
6 .
In a similar way we have
Σx3 = x4
4ω −3ω
2 Σx2 −ω2Σx −ω3
4 Σ1.
If for Σx2, Σx, and Σ1 we substitute the previously found values, we obtain
Σx3 = x4

4 .
Then, since
Σx4 = x5
5ω −2ωΣx3 −2ωΣx2 −ω3Σx −ω4

when we make the appropriate substitutions we have
Σx4 = x5

Later we will show an easier method to obtain these expressions.
28.
If the given diﬀerence is for a polynomial function of x, then its sum
(or the function of which it is the diﬀerence) can easily be found with these
formulas. Since the diﬀerence is made up of diﬀerent powers of x, we ﬁnd
the sum of each term and then collect all of these terms.
Example 1. Find the function whose diﬀerence is ax2 + bx + c.
We ﬁnd the sum of each term by means of the formulas found above:
Σax2 = ax3
3ω −ax2
2

Σbx = bx2

Σc = cx

When we collect these sums we obtain

which is the desired function, whose diﬀerence is ax2 + bx + c.
Example 2. Find the function whose diﬀerence is x4 −2ω2x2 + ω4.

Σx4 = 1

As a check, if instead of x we put x+ω and from this expression we subtract
the one we have found, the given diﬀerence x4−2ω2x2+ω4 is what remains.

29. If we carefully observe the sums of the powers of x that we have found,
the ﬁrst, second, and third terms, we quickly discover the laws of formation
that they follow. The law for the following terms is not so obvious that we
can state in general the sum for the power xn. Later (in paragraph 132 of
the second part) we will show that

The main interest here is the sequence of purely numerical coeﬃcients. It

30. It is clear that if n is not a positive integer, then the expression for the
sum is going to be an inﬁnite series, nor can it be expressed in ﬁnite form.
Furthermore, here we should note that not all powers of x with exponents
less than n occur. All of the terms xn−2, xn−4, xn−6, . . . are lacking, that
is, they have coeﬃcients equal to zero, although the second term, xn, does
not follow this law, since it has coeﬃcient −1
2. If n is negative or a fraction,
then this sum can be expressed as an inﬁnite series with the sole exception
that n cannot be −1, since in that case the term

If a given diﬀerence is any power of x, then its sum, or the function
from which it came, can be given. However, if the given diﬀerence is of
some other form, so that it cannot be expressed in parts that are powers of
x, then the sum may be very diﬃcult, and frequently impossible, to ﬁnd,
unless by chance it is clear that it came from some function. For this reason
it is useful to investigate the diﬀerence of many functions and carefully to
note them, so that when this diﬀerence is given, its sum or the function
from which it came can be immediately given. In the meantime, the method
of inﬁnite series will supply many rules whose use will marvelously aid in
ﬁnding sums.
32.
Frequently, it is easier to ﬁnd the sum if the given diﬀerence can be
expressed as a product of linear factors that form an arithmetic progression
whose diﬀerence is ω. Suppose the given function is (x + ω) (x + 2ω). Since
when we substitute x + ω for x we obtain (x + 2ω) (x + 3ω), then the dif-
ference will be 2ω (x + 2ω). Hence, going backwards, if the given diﬀerence
is 2ω (x + 2ω), then its sum is (x + ω) (x + 2ω). From this it follows that
Σ (x + 2ω) = 1
2ω (x + ω) (x + 2ω) .
Similarly, if the given function is (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω), since its diﬀer-
ence is 2ω (x + (n + 1) ω), we have
Σ (x + (n + 1) ω) = 1
2ω (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) ,

22
1. On Finite Diﬀerences
and
Σ (x + nω) = 1
2ω (x + (n −1) ω) (x + nω) .
33.
If the function is the product of several factors, such as
y = (x + (n −1) ω) (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) ,
then since
yI = (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω) ,
we have
∆y = 3ω (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) .
It follows that
Σ (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) = 1
3ω (x + (n −1) ω) (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) .
In the same way we ﬁnd that
Σ (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω)
= 1
4ω (x + (n −1) ω) (x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω) .
Hence the law for ﬁnding sums is quite clear if the diﬀerence is the product
of several factors of this kind. Although these diﬀerences are polynomials,
still this method of ﬁnding their sums seems to be easier than the previous
method.
34. From this method the way is now clear to ﬁnding the sums of fractions.
Let the given fraction be
y =
1
x + nω .
Since
yI =
1
x + (n + 1) ω ,
we have
∆y =
1
x + (n + 1) ω −
1
x + nω =
−ω
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω),
and it follows that
Σ
1
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) = −1
ω ·
1
x + nω .

1. On Finite Diﬀerences
23
Furthermore, let
y =
1
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω).
Since
yI =
1
(x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω),
we have
∆y =
−2ω
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω),
and it follows that
Σ
1
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω)
= −1
2ω ·
1
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω).
In a similar way we have
Σ
1
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω) (x + (n + 3) ω)
= −1
3ω ·
1
(x + nω) (x + (n + 1) ω) (x + (n + 2) ω).
35.
We should observe this method carefully, since sums of diﬀerences of
this kind cannot be found by the previous method. If the diﬀerence has a
numerator or the denominator has factors that do not form an arithmetic
progression, then the safest method for ﬁnding sums is to express the frac-
tion as the sum of partial fractions. Although we may not be able to ﬁnd
the sum of an individual fraction, it may be possible to consider them in
pairs. We have only to see whether it may be possible to use the formula
Σ
1
x + (n + 1) ω −Σ
1
x + nω =
1
x + nω .
Although neither of these sums is known, still their diﬀerence is known.
36.
In these cases the problem is reduced to ﬁnding the partial fractions,
and this is treated at length in a previous book.5 In order that we may see
its usefulness for ﬁnding sums, we will consider some examples.

does not occur, it signiﬁes that this sum cannot be found.

On the Use of Diﬀerences
in the Theory of Series
37.
It is well known that the nature of series can be very well illustrated
from ﬁrst principles through diﬀerences. Indeed, arithmetic progressions,
which are ordinarily considered ﬁrst, have this particular property, that
their ﬁrst diﬀerences are equal to each other. From this it follows that their
second diﬀerences and all higher diﬀerences will vanish. There are series
whose second diﬀerences are constant and for this reason are conveniently
called of the second order, while arithmetic progressions are said to be of
the ﬁrst order. Furthermore, series of the third order are those whose third
diﬀerences are constant; those of the fourth order and higher orders are
those whose fourth and higher diﬀerences are constant.
38.
In this division there is an inﬁnite number of kinds of series, but by
no means can all series be reduced to one of these. There are innumerably
many series whose successive diﬀerences never reduce to constants. Besides
innumerable others, the geometric progressions never have constant diﬀer-
ences of any order. For example, consider
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, . . .
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, . . .
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . . .
Since the series of diﬀerences of each order is equal to the original series,
equality of diﬀerences is completely excluded. There are many classes of
series, of which only one class is such that its diﬀerences of various orders

26
2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
ﬁnally reduce to a constant; this chapter will be particularly concerned
with that class.
39.
Two things are especially important concerning the nature of series:
the general term and the sum of the series. The general term is an expression
that contains each term of the series and for that reason is a function of the
variable x such that when x = 1 the ﬁrst term of the series is obtained, the
second when we let x = 2, the third when x = 3, the fourth when x = 4,
and so forth. When we know the general term of a series we can ﬁnd any
of the terms, even if the law that relates one term to another is not clear.
Thus, for example, for x = 1000 we immediately know the thousandth
term. In the series
1,
6,
15,
28,
45,
66,
91,
120,
. . .
the general term is 2x2 −x. If x = 1, this formula gives the ﬁrst term, 1;
when x = 2 we obtain the second term, 6; if we let x = 3, the third term
15 appears, and so forth. It is clear that for the 100th term we let x = 100,
and then 2 · 10000 −100 = 19900 is the term.
40.
Indices or exponents in a series are the numbers that indicate which
term we are concerned with; thus the index of the ﬁrst term will be 1, that
of the second will be 2, of the third 3, and so forth. Thus the indices of any
series are usually written in the following way:
Indices
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
. . .
Terms
A
B
C
D
E
F
G
. . .
It is thus immediately clear that G is the seventh term of a given series.
From this we see that the general term is nothing else than the term of the
series whose index is the indeﬁnite number x. First we will discover how
to ﬁnd the general term of a series whose diﬀerences, either ﬁrst, second,
or some other diﬀerence is constant. Then we will turn our attention to
ﬁnding the sum.
41. We begin with the ﬁrst order, which contains arithmetic progressions,
whose ﬁrst diﬀerences are constant. Let a be the ﬁrst term of the series
and let the ﬁrst term of the series of diﬀerences be b, which is equal to all
other terms of this series. Hence the series has the form:
Indices

. . .
Diﬀerences
b,
b,
b,
b,
b,
b,
. . .
From this it is immediately clear that the term whose index is x will be
a + (x −1) b and the general term will be bx + a −b. This is formed from

27
both terms of the series itself and terms of the series of diﬀerences. If we
call the second term of the series aI, since b = aI −a, then the general term
is

aI −a

x + 2a −aI = aI (x −1) −a (x −2) .
Hence from our knowledge of the ﬁrst and second terms of an arithmetic
progression we form the general term.
42. Let a be the ﬁrst term of a series of the second order, let b be the ﬁrst
term of the series of ﬁrst diﬀerences, and let c be the ﬁrst term of the series
of second diﬀerences. Then the series with its diﬀerences have the following
form:
Indices:
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7
Terms:
a, a + b, a + 2b + c, a + 3b + 3c, a + 4b + 6c, a + 5b + 10c, a + 6b + 15c
First Diﬀerences:
b,
b + c,

b + 3c,
b + 4c,
b + 5c,
. . .
Second Diﬀerences:
c,
c,

c,

. . .
By inspection we conclude that the term with index x will be
a + (x −1) b + (x −1) (x −2)
1 · 2
c,
and this is the general term of the given series. However, if we let the
second term of the series be aI and the third term be aII, since b = aI −a
and c = aII −2aI + a, as we understand from the deﬁnition of diﬀerences
(paragraph 10), we have the general term
a + (x −1)

aI −a

But this reduces to the form

It follows that the general term is deﬁned by the ﬁrst three terms of the
series.

Let a, aI, aII, aIII, aIV, . . . be the terms of a series of the third order,
let b, bI, bII, bIII, . . . be its ﬁrst diﬀerences, and let c, cI, cII, cIII, . . . be
its second diﬀerences, while d, d, d, . . . are its third diﬀerences, which of

so that the general term is formed from the diﬀerences. Since we have
b = aI −a,
c = aII −2aI + a,
d = aIII −3aII + 3aI −a,
when these values are substituted, the general term will be

and so forth. From the ﬁrst term of the series and the ﬁrst terms of the

until we come to the constant diﬀerences. From this it is clear that if we
never produce constant diﬀerences, then the general term will be expressed
by an inﬁnite series.
45.
Since the diﬀerences are formed from the terms of the given series, if
these values are substituted, the general term in this form for any series
of the ﬁrst, second, and third orders have been given. For a series of the
fourth order the general term is

From this the law of formation for the general term for higher-order se-
quences is easily seen. It is also clear that for any order the general term
will be a polynomial in x whose degree will be no higher than the or-
der of the series to which it refers. Thus, a series of the ﬁrst order has
a general term that is a ﬁrst-degree function, a second-order series has a
second-degree term, and so forth.

30
2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
46.
The diﬀerences, as we have seen above, can be expressed in terms of
the original series as follows:
b = aI −a,
c = aII −2aI + a,
d = aIII −3aII + 3aI −a,
bI = aII −aI,
cI = aIII −2aII + aI,
dI = aIV −3aIII + 3aII −aI,
bII = aIII −aII,
cII = aIV −2aIII + aII,
dII = aV −3aIV + 3aIII −aII,
. . . ,
. . . ,
. . . .
Since in a series of the ﬁrst order all values of c vanish, we have
aII = 2aI −a,
aIII = 2aII −aI,
aIV = 2aIII −aII,
. . . ,
and so it is clear that these series are recurrent and that the scale of relation
is 2, −1. Then, since in a series of the second order all values of d vanish,
we have
aIII = 3aII −3aI + a,
aIV = 3aIII −3aII + aI,
. . . .
From this it follows that these series are recurrent with a scale of relation
3, −3, 1. In a similar way it can be shown that each such series of any order
is both a recurrent series and the scale of relation consists of the binomial
coeﬃcients where the exponent is one more than the order of the series.
47.
Since in a series of the ﬁrst order we also have all d’s, e’s, and all of
the subsequent diﬀerences vanishing, we also have
aIII = 3aII −3aI + a,
aIV = 3aIII −3aII + aI,
and so forth, or
aIV = 4aIII −6aII + 4aI −a,
aV = 4aIV −6aIII + 4aII −aI,
and so forth. From this it follows that these are recurrent series, indeed in
an inﬁnite number of ways, since the scales of relation can be 3, −3, +1;
4, −6, +4, −1; 5, −10, +10, −5 + 1; . . . . In a similar way it should be un-
derstood that each of the series of the kind we have been discussing is a
recurrent series in an inﬁnite number of ways and that the scale of relation
is
n,
−n (n −1)
1 · 2
,
+n (n −1) (n −2)
1 · 2 · 3
,
−n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3)
1 · 2 · 3 · 4
,

and so forth, provided that n is an integer and is larger than the order of the
given series. These series can also arise from fractions whose denominator is
(1 −y)n, as is shown in a previous book1 where recurrent series are treated
at greater length.
48.
As we have seen, every series of this class, no matter of what order,
has a general term that is a polynomial. On the other hand, we will see that
every series that has this kind of function for its general term belongs to
this class of series and the diﬀerences eventually are a constant. Indeed, if
the general term is a second-degree polynomial of the form ax2+bx+c, then
the series obtained by letting x be equal successively to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . , will
be of the second order, and the second diﬀerence will be constant. Likewise,
if the general term is a third-degree polynomial ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, then
the series will be of the third order, and so forth.
49.
From the general term we can ﬁnd not only all of the terms of the
series, but also the series of diﬀerences, both the ﬁrst diﬀerences and also
the higher diﬀerences. If the ﬁrst term of a series is subtracted from the
second, we obtain the ﬁrst term of the series of diﬀerences. Likewise, we
obtain the second term of this series if we subtract the second term from
the third term of the original series. Thus we obtain the term of the series
of diﬀerences whose index is x if we subtract the term of the original series
whose index is x from the term whose index is x + 1. Hence, if in the
general term of the series we substitute x + 1 for x and from this subtract
the general term, the remainder will be the general term of the series of
diﬀerences. If X is the general term of the series, then its diﬀerence ∆X
(which is obtained in the way shown in the previous chapter if we let ω = 1)
is the general term of the series of ﬁrst diﬀerences. Likewise, ∆2X is the
general term of the series of second diﬀerences; ∆3X is the general term of
the series of third diﬀerences, and so forth.
50.
If the general term X is a polynomial of degree n, from the previous
chapter we know that its diﬀerence ∆X is a polynomial of degree n −1.
Furthermore, ∆2X is of degree n −2, and ∆3X is of degree n −3, and so
forth. It follows that if X is a ﬁrst-degree polynomial, as is ax + b, then its
diﬀerence ∆X is the constant a. Since this is the general term of the series
of ﬁrst diﬀerences, we see that a series whose general term is a ﬁrst-degree
polynomial is an arithmetic progression, that is, a series of the ﬁrst order.
Likewise, if the general term is a second-degree polynomial, since ∆2X is a
constant, the series of second diﬀerences is constant and the original series
is of second order. In like manner it is always true that the degree of the
general term is the order of the series it deﬁnes.

The rules given in the previous chapter for ﬁnding diﬀerences of any order
can now be used to ﬁnd the general terms for diﬀerences of any order for a
given series.
52.
If the general term for any series is known, then not only can it be
used to ﬁnd all of the terms, but it can also be used to reverse the order
and ﬁnd terms with negative indices, by substituting negative values for x.
For example, if the general term is

x2 + 3x

/2 and we use both negative
and positive indices, we can continue the series in both ways as follows:
Indices:
. . . , −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .
Series:
. . . , 5, 2, 0, −1, −1, 0, 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, 27, . . .
First Diﬀerences:
. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .
Second Diﬀerences:
. . . , 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
. . .

2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
33
Since the general term is formed from the diﬀerences, any series can be
continued backwards so that if the diﬀerences ﬁnally are constant, the gen-
eral term can be expressed in ﬁnite form. If the diﬀerences are not ﬁnally
constant, then the general term requires an inﬁnite expression. From the
general term we can also deﬁne terms whose indices are fractions, and this
gives an interpolation of the series.
53.
After these remarks about the general terms of series we now turn to
the investigation of the sum, or general partial sum, of a series of any order.
Given any series the general partial sum is a function of x that is equal to
the sum of x terms of the series. Hence the general partial sum will be such
that if x = 1, then it will be equal to the ﬁrst term of the series. If x = 2,
then it gives the sum of the ﬁrst two terms of the series; let x = 3, and
we have the sum of the ﬁrst three terms, and so forth. Therefore, if from
a given series we form a new series whose ﬁrst term is equal to the ﬁrst
term of the given series, second term is the sum of the ﬁrst two terms of
the given series, the third of the ﬁrst three terms, and so forth, then this
new series is its partial sum series. The general term of this new series is
the general partial sum. Hence, ﬁnding the general partial sum brings us
back to ﬁnding the general term of a series.
54.
Let the given series be
a,
aI,
aII,
aIII,
aIV,
aV,
. . .
and let the series of partial sums be
A,
AI,
AII,
AIII,
AIV,
AV,
. . . .
From the deﬁnition we have
A = a,
AI = a + aI,
AII = a + aI + aII,
AIII = a + aI + aII + aIII,
AIV = a + aI + aII + aIII + aIV,
AV = a + aI + aII + aIII + aIV + aV,
and so forth. Now, the series of diﬀerences of the series of partial sums is
AI −A = aI,
AII −AI = aII,
AIII −AII = aIII,
. . . ,
so that if we remove the ﬁrst term of the given series, we have the series
of ﬁrst diﬀerences of the series of partial sums. If we supply a zero as the

34
2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
ﬁrst term of the series of partial sums, to give
0,
A,
AI,
AII,
AIII,
AIV,
AV,
. . . ,
then the series of ﬁrst diﬀerences is the given series
a,
aI,
aII,
aIII,
aIV,
aV,
. . . .
55.
For this reason, the ﬁrst diﬀerences of the given series are the second
diﬀerences of the series of partial sums; the second diﬀerences of the former
are the third diﬀerences of the latter; the third of the former are the fourth
of the latter, and so forth. Hence, if the given series ﬁnally has constant
diﬀerences, then the series of partial sums also eventually has constant
diﬀerences and so is of the same kind except one order higher. It follows
that this kind of series always has a partial sum that can be given as a
ﬁnite expression. Indeed, the general term of the series
0,
A,
AI,
AII,
AIII,
AIV,
. . . ,
or that expression which corresponds to x, gives the sum of the x−1 terms
of the series a, aI, aII, aIII, aIV, . . . . If instead of x we write x+1, we obtain
the sum of x terms which is the general term.
56.
Let a given series be
a,
aI,
aII,
aIII,
aIV,
aV,
aVI,
. . . .
The series of ﬁrst diﬀerences is
b,
bI,
bII,
bIII,
bIV,
bV,
bVI,
. . . ,
the series of second diﬀerences is
c,
cI,

. . . ,
the series of third diﬀerences is
d,
dI,
dII,
dIII,
dIV,
dV,
dVI,
. . . ,
and so forth, until we come to constant diﬀerences. We then form the series
of partial sums, with 0 as its ﬁrst term, and the succeeding diﬀerences in
the following way:

2,
3,

The general term of the series of partial sums, that is, the term correspond-
ing to the index x, is
0 + (x −1) a + (x −1) (x −2)
1 · 2
b + (x −1) (x −2) (x −3)
1 · 2 · 3
c + · · · ,
but this is also the series of partial sums of the ﬁrst x−1 terms of the given
series a, aI, aII, aIV, . . . .
57.
Hence, if instead of x −1 we write x, we obtain the series of partial
sums
xa + x (x −1)
1 · 2
b + x (x −1) (x −2)
1 · 2 · 3
c + x (x −1) (x −2) (x −3)
1 · 2 · 3 · 4
d + · · · .
If we let the letters b, c, d, e, . . . keep the assigned values, then we have
Series:
a,
aI,
aII,
aIII,
aIV,
aV,
. . .
General Term:
a + (x −1) b + (x −1) (x −2)

c + (x −1) (x −2) (x −3)

1 · 2 · 3
c+ x (x −1) (x −2) (x −3)
1 · 2 · 3 · 4
d+· · · .
Therefore, once a series of any order is found, the general term can easily
be found from the partial sum in the way we have shown, namely, by
combining diﬀerences.
58.
This method of ﬁnding the partial sum of a series through diﬀerences
is most useful for those series whose diﬀerences eventually become constant.
In other cases we do not obtain a ﬁnite expression. If we pay close attention
to the character of the partial sums, which we have already discussed, then
another method is open to us for ﬁnding the partial sum immediately from
the general term. Indeed this method is much more general, and in the
inﬁnite case we obtain ﬁnite expressions, rather than the inﬁnite that we
obtain from the previous method. Let a given series be
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
f,
. . . ,

36
2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
with X the general term corresponding to the index x, and S the partial
sum. Since S is the sum of the ﬁrst x terms, the sum of the ﬁrst x−1 terms
is S −X. Furthermore, X is the diﬀerence, since this is what remains when
S −X is subtracted from the next term S.
59.
Since X = ∆(S −X) is the diﬀerence, as deﬁned in the previous
chapter, provided that we let the constant ω equal 1, if we return to the
sum, then we have ΣX = S −X, and the desired partial sum is
S = ΣX + X + C.
Hence we need to ﬁnd the sum of the function X by the method previously
discussed, to which we add the general term X to obtain the partial sum.
Since this process involves a constant quantity that must either be added
or subtracted, we need to accommodate this to the present case. It is clear
that if we let x = 0, the number of terms in the sum is zero, and the sum
also should be zero. From this fact the constant C should be calculated by
letting both x = 0 and S = 0. In the expression S = ΣX + X + C with
both S = 0 and x = 0, we obtain the value of C.
60.
Since this whole business reduces to the sums of functions we found
(in paragraph 27) when ω = 1, we recall those results, especially for the
powers of x:
Σx0 = Σ1 = x,
Σx = 1
2x2 −1
2x,
Σx2 = 1
3x3 −1
2x2 + 1

12x2,
Σx6 = 1
7x7 −1
2x6 + 1
2x5 −1
6x3 + 1
42x.
In paragraph 29 we gave the sum for a general power of x, provided that
everywhere we let ω = 1. With these formulas we can easily ﬁnd the partial
sum, provided that the general term is a polynomial in x.
61.
Let S.X be the partial sum of the series whose general term is X. As
we have seen,
S.X = ΣX + X + C,

2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
37
where C is the constant we obtain by letting S.X vanish when we let x = 0.
It follows that we can express the partial sum of the series of powers, that
is, the series for which the general term has the form xn. We let
S.X = 1 + 2n + 3n + 4n + · · · + xn.

and so forth. These formulas can be continued to the twenty-ninth power.
Indeed, they can be carried to even higher powers, provided that the nu-
merical coeﬃcients have been worked out.

In these formulas we can observe a general law, with whose help we
can easily ﬁnd any one of the formulas from the preceding formula, except
for the last term, in case the power of that term is 1. In that case we have
to ﬁnd one more term. If we ignore that term for the moment, and if
S.xn = αxn+1 + βxn + γxn−1 −δxn−3 + ϵxn−5 −ζxn−7 + ηxn−9 −· · · ,
then the subsequent formula will be
S.xx+1 = n + 1

n −2δxn−2

n −4ϵxn−4 −n + 1
n −6ζxn−6 + n + 1
n −8ηxn−8 −· · · ,
and if n is even, we obtain the true formula. If n is odd, then the formula
is lacking a term, which has the form ±φx. Now with very little work we
can discover φ. Since when we let x = 1 the partial sum should be but a
single term, the ﬁrst term, and this is equal to 1, if we let x = 1 in all of the
terms found so far, the sum should be equal to 1. In this way we evaluate
φ. Once this is found we can proceed to the next step. In this way all of
these sums can be found. Thus, since
S.x5 = 1
6x6 + 1
2x5 + 5
12x4 −1
12x2,
we have
S.x6 = 6
7 · 1
6x7 + 6
6 · 1
2x6 + 6
5 · 5
12x5 −6
3 · 1
12x3 + φx,
or
S.x6 = 1
7x7 + 1
2x6 + 1
2x5 −1
6x3 + φx.
Now let x = 1, so that 1 = 1

42, just
as we found in the general form.
64.
By means of these formulas for partial sums we can easily ﬁnd the
partial sums of all series whose general term is a polynomial, and much
more expeditiously than by the previous method using diﬀerences.
Example 1. Find the partial sum of the series 2, 7, 15, 26, 40, 57, 77, 100,
126, . . . , whose general term is (3x2 + x)/2.
Since the general term consists of two members, we ﬁnd the partial sum
for each of them from the above formulas
S.3
2x2 = 1
2x3 + 3
4x2 + 1
4x

and
S.1
2x = 1

4x,
so that
S.3x2 + x
2
= 1
2x3 + x2 + 1
2x = 1
2x (x + 1)2 ,
and this is the desired partial sum. Thus if x = 5, we have 5
2 · 62 = 90,
while the sum of the terms is
2 + 7 + 15 + 26 + 40 = 90.
Example 2. Find the partial sum of the series 1, 27, 125, 343, 729, 1331,
. . . , which is the sum of the cubes of the odd integers.
The general term of this series is
(2x −1)3 = 8x3 −12x2 + 6x −1,
so we collect the partial sums in the following way:
+8.S.x3 = 2x4 + 4x3 + 2x2,
−12.S.x2 = −4x3 −6x2 −2x,
+6.S.x = +3x2 + 3x,
and
−1.S.x0 = −x.
Then the desired sum is
2x4 −x2 = x2 
2x2 −1

.
Hence, if x = 6, we have 36 · 71 = 2556, which is the sum of the ﬁrst six
terms of the given series:
1 + 27 + 125 + 343 + 729 + 1331 = 2556.
65.
If the general term is a product of linear factors as in paragraph 32,
then it is easier to ﬁnd the partial sums by the method treated in that

section and the sections following. When we let ω = 1, we have
Σ (x + n) = 1
2 (x + n −1) (x + n) ,
Σ (x + n) (x + n + 1) = 1
3 (x + n −1) (x + n) (x + n + 1) ,
Σ (x + n) (x + n + 1) (x + n + 2) = 1
4 (x + n −1) (x + n) (x + n + 1)
× (x + n + 2) ,
and so forth. If we add to these sums the general term and a constant,
which can be calculated by letting x = 0, with the partial sum vanishing,
then we obtain the following:
S. (x + n) = 1
2 (x + n) (x + n + 1) −1
2n (n + 1) ,
S. (x + n) (x + n + 1) = 1
3 (x + n) (x + n + 1) (x + n + 2)

3n (n + 1) (n + 2) ,
S. (x + n) (x + n + 1) (x + n + 2) = 1

× (x + n + 3)
−1
4n (n + 1) (n + 2) (n + 3) ,
and so forth.
If we let n = 0 or n = −1, then the constant in these partial sums will
vanish.
66. For the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . , whose general term is x, the partial sum
is 1
2x (x + 1) . The series of partial sums, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, . . . has a partial sum
x (x + 1) (x + 2)

This series of partial sums 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, . . . has a partial sum
x (x + 1) (x + 2) (x + 3)

which is the general term of the series 1, 5, 15, 35, 70, . . . with partial sum

1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5

2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
These series have a special importance, since they have many applications.
For instance, from these we obtain coeﬃcients of binomials with high de-
grees, and it is clear to anyone with some experience in this area that these
are important.
67.
We can also use these to ﬁnd more easily the partial sums that we
formerly found with diﬀerences. Since we found the general term to be of
the form
a + x −1
1
b + (x −1) (x −2)
1 · 2
c + (x −1) (x −2) (x −3)
1 · 2 · 3
d + · · · ,
if we take the partial sum of each member and then add all of these, we
will have the partial sum of the series with the given general term. Thus,
since
S.1 = x,
S. (x −1) = 1
2x (x −1) ,
S. (x −1) (x −2) = 1
3x (x −1) (x −2) ,
S. (x −1) (x −2) (x −3) = 1
4x (x −1) (x −2) (x −3) ,
and so forth, we have the desired partial sum
xa + x (x −1)
1 · 2
b + x (x −1) (x −2)
1 · 2 · 3
c + x (x −1) (x −2) (x −3)
1 · 2 · 3 · 4
d + · · · ,
and this is exactly the form we obtained before in paragraph 57 with dif-
ferences.
68.
We can also ﬁnd these partial sums for quotients. Since previously, in
paragraph 34, we obtained, when ω = 1,
Σ
1
(x + n) (x + n + 1) = −1 ·
1
x + n,
so that
S.
1
(x + n) (x + n + 1) = −1 ·
1
x + n + 1 +
1
n + 1.
In a similar way, if we add to the above sum the general term, or, what
comes to the same thing, if in these expressions we substitute x + 1 for x,
then we have
S.
1
(x + n) (x + n + 1) (x + n + 2)
= −1
2 ·
1
(x + n + 1) (x + n + 2) + 1

(x + n + 1) (x + n + 2) (x + n + 3)
+ 1
3 ·
1
(n + 1) (n + 2) (n + 3).
These forms can easily be continued as far as desired.
69.
Since
S.
1
(x + n) (x + n + 1) =
1
n + 1 −
1
x + n + 1,
we also have
S.
1
x + n −S.
1
x + n + 1 =
1
n + 1 −
1
x + n + 1.
Although neither of these two partial sums can be expressed by itself, still
their diﬀerence is known. In many cases, by this means the sum of the series
can be reasonably found. This is the case if the general term is a quotient
whose denominator can be factored into linear factors. The whole quotient
is expressed as partial fractions, and then by means of this lemma it soon
becomes clear whether we can ﬁnd the partial sum.
Example 1. Find the partial sum of the series 1+ 1
3 + 1
6 + 1
10 + 1

whose general term is 2/

This general term can be expressed as

It follows that the partial sum is

By the previous lemma we have that this is equal to

General terms that have the form of binomial coeﬃcients deserve
special notice. We will ﬁnd the partial sums of series whose numerators are
1 and whose denominators are binomial coeﬃcients. Hence, a series whose:
general term is
has partial sum
1 · 2

5
4 −
1 · 2 · 3 · 5
(x + 1) (x + 2) (x + 3) (x + 4),
and so forth. From this the law by which these expressions proceed is
obvious. However, the partial sum that corresponds to the general term
1/x is not obtained, since it cannot be expressed in ﬁnite form.
71.
Since the partial sum has x terms if the index is x, it is clear that if
we let the index become inﬁnite, we obtain the sum of these inﬁnite series.

2. On the Use of Diﬀerences in the Theory of Series
45
In this case, in the expressions just found, the later terms will vanish due
to the denominators becoming inﬁnite.
Hence, these inﬁnite series have ﬁnite sums, as follows:
1 + 1
3 + 1
6 + 1
10 + 1
15 + · · · = 2
1,
1 + 1
4 + 1
10 + 1

and so forth. Therefore, every series whose partial sum we know can be
continued to inﬁnity, and the sum can be exhibited by letting x = ∞,
provided that the sum is ﬁnite; this will be the case if in the partial sum
the power of x is the same in both the numerator and denominator.

On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
72.
Since every quantity, no matter how large, can always be increased,
and there is no obstacle to adding to a given quantity another like quantity,
it follows that every quantity can be increased without limit. Furthermore,
there is no quantity so large that a larger one cannot be conceived, and so
there is no doubt that every quantity can be increased to inﬁnity. If there
is someone who would deny this, he would have to give some quantity that
cannot be increased, and so he needs to give a quantity to which nothing
can be added. This is absurd, and even the idea of quantity rules out this
possibility. He must necessarily concede that every quantity can always be
increased without limit, that is, it can be increased to inﬁnity.
73.
For each kind of quantity this becomes even clearer. No one can
easily defend himself if he declares that the series of natural numbers,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . has a limit beyond which it cannot be continued. Indeed,
there is no such number to which 1 cannot be added to obtain the following
number, which is greater. Hence, the series of natural numbers continues
without limit, nor is it possible to come to some greatest number beyond
which there is no greater number. In like manner the straight line cannot
be extended to such a point that it cannot be extended further. By this it
is clear that both the integers and the line can be increased to inﬁnity. No
matter what kind of quantity it may be, we should understand that every
quantity, no matter how large, can always be made greater and greater,
and thus increased without limit, that is, increased to inﬁnity.

48
3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
74.
Although these things are clear enough, so that anyone who would
deny them must contradict himself, still, this theory of the inﬁnite has been
so obfuscated by so many diﬃculties and even involved in contradictions
by many who have tried to explain it, that no way is open by which they
may extricate themselves. From the fact that a quantity can be increased
to inﬁnity, some have concluded that there is actually an inﬁnite quantity,
and they have described it in such a way that it cannot be increased.
In this way they overturn the very idea of quantity, since they propose a
quantity of such a kind that it cannot be increased. Furthermore, those who
admit such an inﬁnity contradict themselves; when they put an end to the
capacity a quantity has of being increased, they simultaneously deny that
the quantity can be increased without limit, since these two statements
come to the same thing. Thus while they admit an inﬁnite quantity, they
also deny it. Indeed, if a quantity cannot be increased without limit, that
is to inﬁnity, then certainly no inﬁnite quantity can exist.
75. Hence, from the fact that every quantity can be increased to inﬁnity, it
seems to follow that there is no inﬁnite quantity. A quantity increased con-
tinuously by increments does not become inﬁnite unless it shall have already
increased without limit. However, that which must increase without limit
cannot be conceived of as having already become inﬁnite. Nevertheless, not
only is it possible to give a quantity of this kind, to which increments are
added without limit, a certain character, and with due care to introduce it
into calculus, as we shall soon see at length, but also there exist real cases,
at least they can be conceived, in which an inﬁnite number actually exists.
Thus, if there are things that are inﬁnitely divisible, as many philosophers
have held to be the case, the number of parts of which this thing is con-
stituted is really inﬁnite. Indeed, if it be claimed that the number is ﬁnite,
then the thing is not really inﬁnitely divisible. In a like manner, if the whole
world were inﬁnite, as many have held, then the number of bodies making
up the world would certainly not be ﬁnite, and would hence be inﬁnite.
76.
Although there seems to be a contradiction here, if we consider it
carefully we can free ourselves from all diﬃculties. Whoever claims that
some material is inﬁnitely divisible denies that in the continuous division
of the material one ever arrives at parts so small that they can no longer be
divided. Hence, this material does not have ultimate indivisible parts, since
the individual particles at which one arrives by continued division must be
able to be further subdivided. Therefore, whoever says, in this case, that
the number of parts is inﬁnite, also understands that the ultimate parts
are indivisible; he tries to count those parts that are never reached, and
hence do not exist. If some material can always be further subdivided, it
lacks indivisible or absolutely simple parts. For this reason, whoever claims
that some material can be inﬁnitely subdivided denies that the material is
made up of simple parts.

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
49
77.
As long as we are speaking about the parts of some body or of some
material, we understand not ultimate or simple parts, of which indeed there
are none, but those that division really produces. Then, since by hypothesis
we admit material that is inﬁnitely divisible, even a very small particle of
material can be dissected into many parts, but no number can be given that
is so large that a greater number of parts cut from that particle cannot be
exhibited. Hence the number of parts, indeed not ultimate parts, but those
that are still further divisible, that make up each body, is greater than
any number that can be given. Likewise, if the whole world is inﬁnite,
the number of bodies making up the world is greater than any assignable
number. Since this is not a ﬁnite number, it follows that an inﬁnite number
and a number greater than any assignable number are two ways of saying
the same thing.
78.
Anyone who has gathered from this discussion any insight into the
inﬁnite divisibility of matter will suﬀer none of the diﬃculties that people
commonly assign to this opinion. Nor will he be forced to admit anything
contrary to sound reasoning. On the other hand, anyone who denies that
matter is inﬁnitely divisible will ﬁnd himself in serious diﬃculties from
which he will in no way be able to extricate himself. These ultimate particles
are called by some atoms, by others monads or simple beings. The reason
why these ultimate particles admit no further division could be for two
possible reasons. The ﬁrst is that they have no extension; the second is
that although they have extension, they are so hard and impenetrable that
no force is suﬃcient to dissect them. Whichever choice is made will lead to
equally diﬃcult positions.
79.
Suppose that ultimate particles lack any extension, so that they lack
any further parts: By this explanation the idea of simple beings is nicely
saved. However, it is impossible to conceive how a body can be constituted
by a ﬁnite number of particles of this sort. Suppose that a cubic foot of
matter is made up of a thousand simple beings of this kind, and that it is
actually cut up into one thousand pieces. If these pieces are equal, they will
each be one cubic ﬁnger; if they are not equal, some will be larger, some
smaller. One cubic ﬁnger will be a simple being, and we will be faced with
a great contradiction, unless by chance we want to say that there is one
simple being and the rest of the space is empty. In this way the continuity
of the body is denied, except that those philosophers completely banished
any vacuum from the world. If someone should object that the number
of simple beings contained in a cubic foot of matter is much more than
a thousand, absolutely nothing is gained. Any diﬃculty that follows from
the number one thousand will remain with any other number, no matter
how large. The inventor of the monad, a very acute man, LEIBNIZ, probed
this problem deeply, and ﬁnally decided that matter is inﬁnitely divisible.
Hence, it is not possible to arrive at a monad before the body is actually

50
3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
inﬁnitely divided. By this very fact, the existence of simple beings that
make up a body is completely refuted. He who denies that bodies are made
up of simple beings and he who claims that bodies are inﬁnitely divisible
are both saying the same thing.
80.
Nor is their position any better if they say that the ultimate particles
of a body are indeed extended, but because of the hardness they cannot
be broken apart. Since they admit extension in the ultimate particles, they
hold that the particles are composite. Whether or not they can be separated
from each other makes little diﬀerence, since they can assign no cause that
explains this hardness. For the most part, however, those who deny the
inﬁnite divisibility of matter seem to have suﬃciently felt the diﬃculties of
this latter position, since usually they cling to the former idea. But they
cannot escape these diﬃculties except with a few trivial metaphysical dis-
tinctions, which generally strive to keep us from trusting the consequences
that follow from mathematical principles. Nor should they admit that sim-
ple parts have dimensions. In the ﬁrst place they should have demonstrated
that these ultimate parts, of which a determined number make up a body,
have no extension.
81. Since they can ﬁnd no way out of this labyrinth, nor can they meet the
objections in a suitable way, they ﬂee to distinctions, and to the objections
they reply with arguments supplied by the senses and the imagination. In
this situation one should rely solely on the intellect, since the senses and ar-
guments depending on them frequently are fallacious. Pure intellect admits
the possibility that one thousandth part of a cubic foot of matter might
lack all extension, while this seems absurd to the imagination. That which
frequently deceives the senses may be true, but it can be decided by no
one except mathematicians. Indeed, mathematics defends us in particular
against errors of the senses and teaches about objects that are perceived by
the senses, sometimes correctly, and sometimes only in appearance. This
is the safest science, whose teaching will save those who follow it from the
illusions of the senses. It is far removed from those responses by which
metaphysicians protect their doctrine and thus rather make it more sus-
pect.
82.
But let us return to our proposition. Even if someone denies that
inﬁnite numbers really exist in this world, still in mathematical speculations
there arise questions to which answers cannot be given unless we admit an
inﬁnite number. Thus, if we want the sum of all the numbers that make
up the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + · · · , since these numbers progress with
no end, and the sum increases, it certainly cannot be ﬁnite. By this fact it
becomes inﬁnite. Hence, this quantity is so large that it is greater than any
ﬁnite quantity and cannot not be inﬁnite. To designate a quantity of this
kind we use the symbol ∞, by which we mean a quantity greater than any
ﬁnite or assignable quantity. Thus, when a parabola needs to be deﬁned in

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
51
such a way that it is said to be an inﬁnitely long ellipse, we can correctly
say that the axis of the parabola is an inﬁnitely long straight line.
83.
This theory of the inﬁnite will be further illustrated if we discuss
that which mathematicians call the inﬁnitely small. There is no doubt that
any quantity can be diminished until it all but vanishes and then goes
to nothing. But an inﬁnitely small quantity is nothing but a vanishing
quantity, and so it is really equal to 0. There is also a deﬁnition of the
inﬁnitely small quantity as that which is less than any assignable quantity.
If a quantity is so small that it is less than any assignable quantity, then
it cannot not be 0, since unless it is equal to 0 a quantity can be assigned
equal to it, and this contradicts our hypothesis. To anyone who asks what
an inﬁnitely small quantity in mathematics is, we can respond that it really
is equal to 0. There is really not such a great mystery lurking in this idea as
some commonly think and thus have rendered the calculus of the inﬁnitely
small suspect to so many. In the meantime any doubts that may remain
will be removed in what follows, where we are going to treat this calculus.
84.
Since we are going to show that an inﬁnitely small quantity is really
zero, we must ﬁrst meet the objection of why we do not always use the
same symbol 0 for inﬁnitely small quantities, rather than some special
ones. Since all nothings are equal, it seems superﬂuous to have diﬀerent
signs to designate such a quantity. Although two zeros are equal to each
other, so that there is no diﬀerence between them, nevertheless, since we
have two ways to compare them, either arithmetic or geometric, let us look
at quotients of quantities to be compared in order to see the diﬀerence.
The arithmetic ratio between any two zeros is an equality. This is not the
case with a geometric ratio. We can easily see this from this geometric
proportion 2 : 1 = 0 : 0, in which the fourth term is equal to 0, as is the
third. From the nature of the proportion, since the ﬁrst term is twice the
second, it is necessary that the third is twice the fourth.
85.
These things are very clear, even in ordinary arithmetic. Everyone
knows that when zero is multiplied by any number, the product is zero and
that n·0 = 0, so that n : 1 = 0 : 0. Hence, it is clear that any two zeros can
be in a geometric ratio, although from the perspective of arithmetic, the
ratio is always of equals. Since between zeros any ratio is possible, in order
to indicate this diversity we use diﬀerent notations on purpose, especially
when a geometric ratio between two zeros is being investigated. In the
calculus of the inﬁnitely small, we deal precisely with geometric ratios of
inﬁnitely small quantities. For this reason, in these calculations, unless we
use diﬀerent symbols to represent these quantities, we will fall into the
greatest confusion with no way to extricate ourselves.
86.
If we accept the notation used in the analysis of the inﬁnite, then
dx indicates a quantity that is inﬁnitely small, so that both dx = 0 and

52
3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
a dx = 0, where a is any ﬁnite quantity. Despite this, the geometric ratio
a dx : dx is ﬁnite, namely a : 1. For this reason these two inﬁnitely small
quantities dx and a dx, both being equal to 0, cannot be confused when
we consider their ratio. In a similar way, we will deal with inﬁnitely small
quantities dx and dy. Although these are both equal to 0, still their ratio
is not that of equals. Indeed, the whole force of diﬀerential calculus is
concerned with the investigation of the ratios of any two inﬁnitely small
quantities of this kind. The application of these ratios at ﬁrst sight might
seem to be minimal. Nevertheless, it turns out to be very great, which
becomes clearer with each passing day.
87.
Since the inﬁnitely small is actually nothing, it is clear that a ﬁnite
quantity can neither be increased nor decreased by adding or subtracting an
inﬁnitely small quantity. Let a be a ﬁnite quantity and let dx be inﬁnitely
small. Then a + dx and a −dx, or, more generally, a ± n dx, are equal to a.
Whether we consider the relation between a ± n dx and a as arithmetic or
as geometric, in both cases the ratio turns out to be that between equals.
The arithmetic ratio of equals is clear: Since n dx = 0, we have
a ± n dx −a = 0.
On the other hand, the geometric ratio is clearly of equals, since
a ± n dx
a
= 1.
From this we obtain the well-known rule that the inﬁnitely small vanishes
in comparison with the ﬁnite and hence can be neglected. For this reason
the objection brought up against the analysis of the inﬁnite, that it lacks
geometric rigor, falls to the ground under its own weight, since nothing is
neglected except that which is actually nothing. Hence with perfect jus-
tice we can aﬃrm that in this sublime science we keep the same perfect
geometric rigor that is found in the books of the ancients.
88. Since the inﬁnitely small quantity dx is actually equal to 0, its square
dx2, cube dx3, and any other dxn, where n is a positive exponent, will
be equal to 0, and hence in comparison to a ﬁnite quantity will vanish.
However, even the inﬁnitely small quantity dx2 will vanish when compared
to dx. The ratio of dx±dx2 to dx is that of equals, whether the comparison
is arithmetic or geometric. There is no doubt about the arithmetic; in the
geometric comparison,
dx ± dx2 : dx = dx ± dx2
dx
= 1 ± dx = 1.
In like manner we have dx ± dx3 = dx and generally dx ± dxn+1 = dx,
provided that n is positive. Indeed, the geometric ratio dx ± dxn+1 : dx

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
53
equals 1 + dxn, and since dxn = 0, the ratio is that of equals. Hence, if we
follow the usage of exponents, we call dx inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst order,
dx2 of the second order, dx3 of the third order, and so forth. It is clear that
in comparison with an inﬁnitely small quantity of the ﬁrst order, those of
higher order will vanish.
89.
In a similar way it is shown that an inﬁnitely small quantity of the
third and higher orders will vanish when compared with one of the second
order. In general, an inﬁnitely small quantity of any higher order vanishes
when compared with one of lower order. Hence, if m is less than n, then
a dxm + b dxn = a dxm,
since dxn vanishes compared with dxm, as we have shown. This is true also
with fractional exponents; dx vanishes compared with
√
dx or dx
1
2 , so that
a
√
dx + b dx = a
√
dx.
Even if the exponent of dx is equal to 0, we have dx0 = 1, although dx = 0.
Hence the power dxn is equal to 1 if n = 0, and from being a ﬁnite quantity
becomes inﬁnitely small if n is greater than 0.
Therefore, there exist an inﬁnite number of orders of inﬁnitely small
quantities. Although all of them are equal to 0, still they must be carefully
distinguished one from the other if we are to pay attention to their mutual
relationships, which has been explained through a geometric ratio.
90.
Once we have established the concept of the inﬁnitely small, it is
easier to discuss the properties of inﬁnity, or the inﬁnitely large. It should
be noted that the fraction 1/z becomes greater the smaller the denominator
z becomes. Hence, if z becomes a quantity less than any assignable quantity,
that is, inﬁnitely small, then it is necessary that the value of the fraction1/z
becomes greater than any assignable quantity and hence inﬁnite. For this
reason, if 1 or any other ﬁnite quantity is divided by something inﬁnitely
small or 0, the quotient will be inﬁnitely large, and thus an inﬁnite quantity.
Since the symbol ∞stands for an inﬁnitely large quantity, we have the
equation
a
dx = ∞.
The truth of this is clear also when we invert:
a
∞= dx = 0.
Indeed, the larger the denominator z of the fraction a/z becomes, the
smaller the value of the fraction becomes, and if z becomes an inﬁnitely
large quantity, that is z = ∞, then necessarily the value of the fraction
a/∞becomes inﬁnitely small.

54
3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
91. Anyone who denies either of these arguments will ﬁnd himself in great
diﬃculties, with the necessity of denying even the most certain principles
of analysis. If someone claims that the fraction a/0 is ﬁnite, for example
equal to b, then when both parts of the equation are multiplied by the
denominator, we obtain a = 0 · b. Then the ﬁnite quantity b multiplied
by zero produces a ﬁnite a, which is absurd. Much less can the value b of
the fraction a/0 be equal to 0; in no way can 0 multiplied by 0 produce
the quantity a. Into the same absurdity will fall anyone who denies that
a/∞= 0, since then he would be saying that a/∞= b, a ﬁnite quantity.
From the equation a/∞= b it would legitimately follow that ∞= a/b, but
from this we conclude that the value of the fraction a/b, whose numerator
and denominator are both ﬁnite quantities, is inﬁnitely large, which of
course is absurd. Nor is it possible that the values of the fractions a/0 and
a/∞could be complex, since the value of a fraction whose numerator is
ﬁnite and whose denominator is complex cannot be either inﬁnitely large
or inﬁnitely small.
92.
An inﬁnitely large quantity, to which we have been led through this
consideration, and which is treated only in the analysis of the inﬁnite, can
best be deﬁned by saying that an inﬁnitely large quantity is the quotient
that arises from the division of a ﬁnite quantity by an inﬁnitely small quan-
tity. Conversely, we can say that an inﬁnitely small quantity is a quotient
that arises from division of a ﬁnite quantity by an inﬁnitely large quantity.
Since we have a geometric proportion in which an inﬁnitely small quantity
is to a ﬁnite quantity as a ﬁnite quantity is to an inﬁnitely large quantity,
it follows that an inﬁnite quantity is inﬁnitely greater than a ﬁnite quan-
tity, just as a ﬁnite quantity is inﬁnitely greater than an inﬁnitely small
quantity. Hence, statements of this sort, which disturb many, should not
be rejected, since they rest on most certain principles. Furthermore, from
the equation a/0 = ∞, it can follow that zero multiplied by an inﬁnitely
large quantity produces a ﬁnite quantity, which would seem strange were
it not the result of a very clear deduction.
93. Just as when we compare inﬁnitely small quantities by a geometric ra-
tio, we can ﬁnd very great diﬀerences, so when we compare inﬁnitely large
quantities the diﬀerence can be even greater, since they diﬀer not only by
geometric ratios, but also by arithmetic. Let A be an inﬁnite quantity that
is obtained from division of a ﬁnite quantity a by the inﬁnitely small dx,
so that a/dx = A. Likewise 2a/dx = 2A and na/dx = nA. Now, since nA
is an inﬁnite quantity, it follows that the ratio between two inﬁnitely large
quantities can have any value. Hence, if an inﬁnite quantity is either multi-
plied or divided by a ﬁnite number, the result will be an inﬁnite quantity.
Nor can it be denied that inﬁnite quantities can be further augmented.
It is easily seen that if the geometric ratio that holds between two inﬁnite

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
55
quantities shows them to be unequal, then even less will an arithmetic ratio
show them to be equal, since their diﬀerence will always be inﬁnitely large.
94.
Although there are some for whom the idea of the inﬁnite, which we
use in mathematics, seems to be suspect, and for this reason think that
analysis of the inﬁnite is to be rejected, still even in the trivial parts of
mathematics we cannot do without it. In arithmetic, where the theory of
logarithms is developed, the logarithm of zero is said to be both negative
and inﬁnite. There is no one in his right mind who would dare to say
that this logarithm is either ﬁnite or even equal to zero. In geometry and
trigonometry this is even clearer. Who is there who would ever deny that
the tangent or the secant of a right angle is inﬁnitely large? Since the
rectangle formed by the tangent and the cotangent has an area equal to
the square of the radius, and the cotangent of a right angle is equal to 0,
even in geometry it has to be admitted that the product of zero and inﬁnity
can be ﬁnite.
95. Since a/dx is an inﬁnite quantity A, it is clear that the quantity A/dx
will be a quantity inﬁnitely greater than the quantity A. This can be seen
from the proportion a/dx : A/dx = a : A, that is, as a ﬁnite number to
one inﬁnitely large. There are relations of this kind between inﬁnitely large
quantities, so that some can be inﬁnitely greater than others. Thus, a/dx2
is a quantity inﬁnitely greater than a/dx; if we let a/dx = A, then a/dx2 =
A/dx. In a similar way a/dx3 is an inﬁnite quantity inﬁnitely greater than
a/dx2, and so is inﬁnitely greater than a/dx. We have, therefore an inﬁnity
of grades of inﬁnity, of which each is inﬁnitely greater than its predecessor.
If the number m is just a little bit greater than n, then a/dxm is an inﬁnite
quantity inﬁnitely greater than the inﬁnite quantity a/dxn.
96. Just as with inﬁnitely small quantities there are geometric ratios indi-
cating inequalities, but arithmetic ratios always indicate equality, so with
inﬁnitely large quantities we have geometric ratios indicating equality, but
whose arithmetic ratios still indicate inequality. If a and b are two ﬁnite
quantities, then the geometric ratio of two inﬁnite quantities a/dx + b and
a/dx indicates that the two are equal; the quotient of the ﬁrst by the sec-
ond is equal to 1+b dx/a = 1, since dx = 0. However, if they are compared
arithmetically, due to the diﬀerence b, the ratio indicates inequality. In a
similar way, the geometric ratio of a/dx2 + a/dx to a/dx2 indicates equal-
ity; expressing the ratio, we have 1 + dx = 1, since dx = 0. On the other
hand, the diﬀerence is a/dx, and so this is inﬁnite. It follows that when we
consider geometric ratios, an inﬁnitely large quantity of a lower grade will
vanish when compared to an inﬁnitely large quantity of a higher grade.
97.
Now that we have been warned about the grades of inﬁnities, we will
soon see that it is possible not only for the product of an inﬁnitely large
quantity and an inﬁnitely small quantity to produce a ﬁnite quantity, as

56
3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
we have already seen, but also that a product of this kind can also be
either inﬁnitely large or inﬁnitely small. Thus, if the inﬁnite quantity a/dx
is multiplied by the inﬁnitely small dx, the product will be equal to the
ﬁnite a. However, if a/dx is multiplied by the inﬁnitely small dx2 or dx3 or
another of higher order, the product will be a dx, a dx2, a dx3, and so forth,
and so it will be inﬁnitely small. In the same way, we understand that if
the inﬁnite quantity a/dx2 is multiplied by the inﬁnitely small dx, then the
product will be inﬁnitely large. In general, if a/dxn is multiplied by b dxm,
the product ab dxm−n will be inﬁnitely small if m is greater than n; it will
be ﬁnite if m equals n; it will be inﬁnitely large if m is less than n.
98.
Both inﬁnitely small and inﬁnitely large quantities often occur in
series of numbers. Since there are ﬁnite numbers mixed in these series, it is
clearer than daylight, how, according to the laws of continuity, one passes
from ﬁnite quantities to inﬁnitely small and to inﬁnitely large quantities.
First let us consider the series of natural numbers, continued both forward
and backward:
. . . , −4, −3, −2, −1, +0, +1, +2, +3, +4, . . . .
By continuously decreasing, the numbers approach 0, that is, the inﬁnitely
small. Then they continue further and become negative. From this we un-
derstand that the positive numbers decrease, passing through 0 to increas-
ing negative numbers. However, if we consider the squares of the numbers,
since they are all positive,
. . . , +16, +9, +4, +1, +0, +1, +4, +9, +16, . . . ,
we have 0 as the transition number from the decreasing positive numbers
to the increasing positive numbers. If all of the signs are changed, then
0 is again the transition from decreasing negative numbers to increasing
negative numbers.
99.
If we consider the series with general term √x, which is continued
both forwards and backwards, we have
. . . , +
√
−3, +
√
−2, +
√
−1, +0, +
√
1, +
√
2, +
√
3, +
√
4, . . . ,
and from this it is clear that 0 is a kind of limit through which real quantities
pass to the complex.
If these terms are considered as points on a curve, it is seen that if they
are positive and decrease so that they eventually vanish, then continuing
further, they become either negative, or positive again, or even complex.
The same happens if the points were ﬁrst negative, then also vanish, and if
they continue further, become either positive, negative, or complex. Many

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
57
examples of phenomena of this kind are found in the theory of plane curves,
treated in a preceding book.1
100.
In the same way inﬁnite terms often occur in series. Thus, in the
harmonic series, whose general term is 1/x, the term corresponding to the
index x = 0 is the inﬁnite term 1/0. The whole series is as follows:
. . . ,
−1
4,
−1
3,
−1
2,
−1
1,
+1
0,
+1
1,
+1
2,
+1
3,
. . . .
Going from right to left the terms increase, so that 1/0 is inﬁnitely large.
Once it has passed through, the terms become decreasing and negative.
Hence, an inﬁnitely large quantity can be thought of as some kind of limit,
passing through which positive numbers become negative and vice versa.
For this reason it has seemed to many that the negative numbers can be
thought of as greater than inﬁnity, since in this series the terms continu-
ously increase, and once they have reached inﬁnity, they become negative.
However, if we consider the series whose general term is 1/x2, then after
passing through inﬁnity, the terms become positive again,
. . . ,
+1
9,
+1
4,
+1
1,
+1
0,
+1
1,
+1
4,
+1
9,
. . . ,
and no one would say that these are greater than inﬁnity.
101.
Frequently, in a series an inﬁnite term will constitute a limit sep-
arating real terms from complex, as occurs in the following series, whose
general term is 1/√x:
. . . , +
1
√−3, +
1
√−2, +
1
√−1, +1
0, + 1
√
1, + 1
√
2, + 1
√
3, . . . .
From this it does not follow that complex numbers are greater than inﬁnity,
since from the series previously discussed,
. . . , +
√
−3, +
√
−2, +
√
−1, +0, +
√
1, +
√
2, +
√
3, . . . ,
it would equally follow that the complex numbers are less than zero. It is
possible to show a change from real terms to complex, where the limit is
neither 0 nor ∞, for example if the general term is 1 + √x. In these cases,
due to the irrationality, each term has two values. In the limit between
real and complex numbers the two values always come together as equals.
Nevertheless, whenever there are terms that are ﬁrst positive and then
become negative, the transition is always through a limit that is inﬁnitely
small or inﬁnitely large. This is all due to the law of continuity, which is
most clearly seen through plane curves.

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
102.
From the summation of inﬁnite series we can gather many results
that both further illustrate this theory of the inﬁnite and also aid in an-
swering doubts that frequently arise in this material. In the ﬁrst place, if
the series has equal terms, such as
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · ,
which is continued to inﬁnity, there is no doubt that the sum of all of these
terms is greater than any assignable number. For this reason it must be
inﬁnite. We conﬁrm this by considering its origin in the expansion of the
fraction
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · .
If we let x = 1, then
1
1 −1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · ,
so that the sum is equal to
1
1 −1 = 1
0 = ∞.
103.
Although there can be no doubt that when the same ﬁnite number
is added an inﬁnite number of times the sum should be inﬁnite, still, the
general inﬁnite series that originates from the fraction
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + · · ·
seems to labor under most serious diﬃculties. If for x we successively sub-
stitute the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , we obtain the following series with their
sums:
A. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · =
1
1−1 = ∞,
B. 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + · · · =
1
1−2 = −1,
C. 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + · · · =
1
1−3 = −1
2,
D. 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + · · · =
1
1−4 = −1
3,
and so forth. Since each term of series B, except for the ﬁrst, is greater
than the corresponding term of series A, the sum of series B must be much
more than the sum of series A. Nevertheless, this calculation shows that
series A has an inﬁnite sum, while series B has a negative sum, which is less
than zero, and this is beyond comprehension. Even less can we reconcile

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
59
with ordinary ideas the results of this and the following series C, D, and
so forth, which have negative sums while all of the terms are positive.
104.
For this reason, the opinion suggested above, namely, that negative
numbers might sometimes be considered greater than the inﬁnite, that is,
more than inﬁnity, might seem to be more probable. Since it is also true
that when decreasing numbers go beyond zero they become negative, a
distinction has to be made between negative numbers like −1, −2, −3, . . .
and negative numbers like
+1
−1
+2
−1
+3
−1,
. . . ,
the former being less than zero and the latter being greater than the inﬁnite.
Even with this agreement, the diﬃculty is not eliminated, as is suggested
by the following series:
1 + 2x + 3x2 + 4x3 + 5x4 + · · · =
1
(1 −x)2 ,
from which we obtain the following series:
A. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + · · · =
1
(1−1)2 = 1
0 = ∞,
B. 1 + 4 + 12 + 32 + 80 + · · · =
1
(1−2)2 = 1.
Now, every term of series B is greater than the corresponding term of series
A, except for the ﬁrst term, and insofar as the sum of series A is inﬁnite,
while the sum of series B is equal to 1, which is only the ﬁrst term, the
suggested principle is no explanation at all.
105.
Since if we were to deny that
−1 = +1
−1
and
+a
−b = −a
+b ,
the very ﬁrmest foundations of analysis would collapse, the previously sug-
gested explanation is not to be admitted. We ought rather to deny that the
sums that the general formula supplied are the true sums. Since these series
are derived by continual division, and while the remainders are divided fur-
ther, the remainders always grow larger the longer we continue, so that the
remainder can never be neglected. Even less can the last remainder, that is,
that divided by an inﬁnitesimal, be omitted, since it is inﬁnite. Since we did
not observe this in the previous series where the remainder became zero, it
should not be surprising that those sums led to absurd results. Since this
response is derived from the very origin of the series itself, it is most true
and it removes all doubt.

60
3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
106.
In order that this may be clariﬁed, let us examine the development
of the fraction 1/ (1 −x) in the ﬁrst ﬁnite number of terms. Hence we have
1
1 −x = 1 +
x
1 −x,
1
1 −x = 1 + x +
x2
1 −x,
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 +
x3
1 −x,
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 +
x4
1 −x,
and so forth. If someone wishes to say that the ﬁnite series 1+x+x2+x3 has
a sum equal to 1/ (1 −x), then he is in error by the quantity x4/ (1 −x);
if he should say that the sum of the series 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + x1000
is 1/ (1 −x), then his error is equal to x1001/ (1 −x). If x happens to be
greater than 1, this error is very large.
107.
From this we see that he who would say that when this same series
is continued to inﬁnity, that is,
1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · + x∞,
and that the sum is 1/ (1 −x), then his error would be x∞+1/ (1 −x), and
if x > 1, then the error is indeed inﬁnite. At the same time, however, this
same argument shows why the series 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + · · · , continued
to inﬁnity, has a true sum of 1/ (1 −x), provided that x is a fraction less
than 1. In this case the error x∞+1 is inﬁnitely small and hence equal to
zero, so that it can safely be neglected. Thus if we let x = 1
2, then in truth
1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + 1
8 + 1
16 + · · · =
1
1 −1
2
= 2.
In a similar way, the rest of the series in which x is a fraction less than 1
will have a true sum in the way we have indicated.
108.
This same answer is valid for the sum of divergent series in which
the signs alternate between + and −, which ordinarily is given by the same
formula, but with the sign of x changed to negative. Since we have
1
1 + x = 1 −x + x2 −x3 + x4 −x5 + · · · ,
if we did not express the ﬁnal remainder, we would have
A. 1 −1 + 1 −1 + 1 −1 + · · · = 1
2,

3. On the Inﬁnite and the Inﬁnitely Small
61
B. 1 −2 + 4 −8 + 16 −32 + · · · = 1
3,
C. 1 −3 + 9 −27 + 81 −243 + · · · = 1
4.
It is clear that the sum of series B cannot be equal to 1
3, since the more
terms we actually sum, the farther away the result gets from 1
3. But the
sum of any series ought to be a limit the closer to which the partial sums
should approach, the more terms are added.
109.
From this we conclude that series of this kind, which are called
divergent, have no ﬁxed sums, since the partial sums do not approach any
limit that would be the sum for the inﬁnite series. This is certainly a true
conclusion, since we have shown the error in neglecting the ﬁnal remainder.
However, it is possible, with considerable justice, to object that these sums,
even though they seem not to be true, never lead to error. Indeed, if we
allow them, then we can discover many excellent results that we would
not have if we rejected them out of hand. Furthermore, if these sums were
really false, they would not consistently lead to true results; rather, since
they diﬀer from the true sum not just by a small diﬀerence, but by inﬁnity,
they should mislead us by an inﬁnite amount. Since this does not happen,
we are left with a most diﬃcult knot to unravel.
110. I say that the whole diﬃculty lies in the name sum. If, as is commonly
the case, we take the sum of a series to be the aggregate of all of its terms,
actually taken together, then there is no doubt that only inﬁnite series
that converge continually closer to some ﬁxed value, the more terms we
actually add, can have sums. However, divergent series, whose terms do
not decrease, whether their signs + and −alternate or not, do not really
have ﬁxed sums, supposing we use the word sum for the aggregate of all
of the terms. Consider these cases that we have recalled, with erroneous
sums, for example the ﬁnite expression 1/ (1 −x) for the inﬁnite series
1+x+x2+x3+· · · . The truth of the matter is this, not that the expression
is the sum of the series, but that the series is derived from the expression.
In this situation the name sum could be completely omitted.
111.
These inconveniences and apparent contradictions can be avoided
if we give the word sum a meaning diﬀerent from the usual. Let us say
that the sum of any inﬁnite series is a ﬁnite expression from which the
series can be derived. In this sense, the true sum of the inﬁnite series
1+x+x2+x3+· · · is 1/ (1 −x), since this series is derived from the fraction,
no matter what value is substituted for x. With this understanding, if
the series is convergent, the new deﬁnition of sum agrees with the usual
deﬁnition. Since divergent series do not have a sum, properly speaking,
there is no real diﬃculty which arises from this new meaning. Finally, with
the aid of this deﬁnition we can keep the usefulness of divergent series and
preserve their reputations.

On the Nature of Diﬀerentials
of Each Order
112. In the ﬁrst chapter we saw that if the variable quantity x received an
increment equal to ω, then from this each function of x obtained an incre-
ment that can be expressed as Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + · · · , and this expression
may be ﬁnite or it may go to inﬁnity. Hence the function y, when we write
x + ω for x, takes the following form:
yI = y + Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + Sω + · · · .
When the previous value of y is subtracted, there remains the diﬀerence of
the function y, which we express as
∆y = Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + Sω4 + · · · .
Since the subsequent value of x is xI = x + ω, we have the diﬀerence
of x, namely, ∆x = ω. The letters P, Q, R, . . . represent functions of x,
depending on y, which we found in the ﬁrst chapter.
113.
Therefore, with whatever increment ω the variable quantity x is in-
creased, at the same time it is possible to deﬁne the increase that accrues to
y, the function of x, provided that we can deﬁne the functions P, Q, R, S, . . .
for any function y. In this chapter, and in all of the analysis of the inﬁnite,
the increment ω by which we let the variable x increase will be inﬁnitely
small, so that it vanishes; that is, it is equal to 0. Hence it is clear that the
increase, or the diﬀerence, of the function y will also be inﬁnitely small.
With this hypothesis, each term of the expression
Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + Sω4 + · · ·

64
4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
will vanish when compared with its predecessor (paragraph 88 and follow-
ing), so that only Pω will remain. For this reason, in the present case where
ω is inﬁnitely small, the diﬀerence of y, ∆y, is equal to Pω.
114.
The analysis of the inﬁnite, which we begin to treat now, is noth-
ing but a special case of the method of diﬀerences, explained in the ﬁrst
chapter, wherein the diﬀerences are inﬁnitely small, while previously the
diﬀerences were assumed to be ﬁnite. Hence, this case, in which the whole
of analysis of the inﬁnite is contained, should be distinguished from the
method of diﬀerences. We use special names and notation for the inﬁnitely
small diﬀerences. With Leibniz we call inﬁnitely small diﬀerences by the
name diﬀerentials. From the discussion in the ﬁrst chapter on the diﬀerent
orders of diﬀerences, we can easily understand the meaning of ﬁrst, second,
third, and so forth, diﬀerentials of any function. Instead of the symbol ∆,
by which we previously indicated a diﬀerence, now we will use the symbol
d, so that dy signiﬁes the ﬁrst diﬀerential of y, d2y the second diﬀerential,
d3y the third diﬀerential, and so forth.
115.
Since the inﬁnitely small diﬀerences that we are now discussing we
call diﬀerentials, the whole calculus by means of which diﬀerentials are
investigated and applied has usually been called diﬀerential calculus. The
English mathematicians (among whom Newton ﬁrst began to develop this
new branch of analysis, as did Leibniz among the Germans) use diﬀerent
names and symbols. They call inﬁnitely small diﬀerences, which we call
diﬀerentials, ﬂuxions and sometimes increments. These words seem to ﬁt
better in Latin, and they signify reasonably well the things themselves.
A variable quantity by continuously increasing takes on various diﬀerent
values, and for this reason can be thought of as being in ﬂux, from which
comes the word ﬂuxion. This was ﬁrst used by Newton for the rate of
change, to designate an inﬁnitely small increment that a quantity receives,
as if, by analogy, it were ﬂowing.
116. It might be uncivil to argue with the English about the use of words
and a deﬁnition, and we might easily be defeated in a judgment about the
purity of Latin and the adequacy of expression, but there is no doubt that
we have won the prize from the English when it is a question of notation. For
diﬀerentials, which they call ﬂuxions, they use dots above the letters. Thus,
˙y signiﬁes the ﬁrst ﬂuxion of y, ¨y is the second ﬂuxion, the third ﬂuxion
has three dots, and so forth. This notation, since it is arbitrary, cannot
be criticized if the number of dots is small, so that the number can be
recognized at a glance. On the other hand, if many dots are required, much
confusion and even more inconvenience may be the result. For example, the
tenth diﬀerential, or ﬂuxion, is very inconveniently represented with ten
dots, while our notation, d10y, is very easily understood. There are cases
where diﬀerentials of even much higher order, or even those of indeﬁnite

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
65
order, must be represented, and for this the English mode is completely
inapt.
117.
We have used both the words and notations that have been accepted
in our countries; they are both more familiar and more convenient. Still, it
is not beside the point that we have spoken about the English usage and
notation, since those who peruse their books will need to know this if they
are to be intelligible. The English are not so wedded to their ways that they
refuse to read writings that use our methods. Indeed, we have read some
of their works with great avidity, and have taken from them much proﬁt. I
have also often remarked that they have proﬁted from reading works from
our regions. For these reasons, although it is greatly to be desired that
everywhere the same mode of expression be used, still it is not so diﬃcult
to accustom ourselves to both methods, so that we can proﬁt from books
written in their way.
118.
Since up to this time we have used the letter ω to denote the diﬀer-
ence or the increment by which the variable x is understood to increase,
now we understand ω to be inﬁnitely small, so that ω is the diﬀerential of x,
and for this reason we use our method of writing ω = dx. From now on, dx
will be the inﬁnitely small diﬀerence by which x is understood to increase.
In like manner the diﬀerential of y we express as dy. If y is any function
of x, the diﬀerential dy will indicate the increment that y receives when x
changes to x + dx. Hence, if we substitute x + dx for x in the function y
and we let yI be the result, then dy = yI −y, and this is understood to be
the ﬁrst diﬀerential, that is, the diﬀerential of the ﬁrst order. Later we will
consider the other diﬀerentials.
119.
We must emphasize the fact that the letter d that we are using here
does not denote a quantity, but is used to express the word diﬀerential,
in the same way that the letter l is used for the word logarithm when the
theory of logarithms is being discussed. In algebra we are used to using
the symbol √for a root. Hence dy does not signify, as it usually does
in analysis, the product of two quantities d and y, but rather we say the
diﬀerential of y. In a similar way, if we write d2y, this is not the square of
a quantity d, but it is simply a short and apt way of writing the second
diﬀerential. Since we use the letter d in diﬀerential calculus not for some
quantity, but only as a symbol, in order to avoid confusion in calculations
when many diﬀerent constant quantities occur, we avoid using the letter d.
Just so we usually avoid the letter l to designate a quantity in calculations
where logarithms occur. It is to be desired that these letters d and l be
altered to give a diﬀerent appearance, lest they be confused with other
letters of the alphabet that are used to designate quantities. This is what
has happened to the letter r, which ﬁrst was used to indicate a root; the r
has been distorted to √.

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
120. If y is any function of x, as we have seen, its ﬁrst diﬀerential will have
the form Pω. Since ω = dx, we have dy = P dx. Whatsoever function of x
y might be, its diﬀerential is expressed by the product of a certain function
of x that we call P and the diﬀerential of x, that is, dx. Although the
diﬀerentials of x and y are both inﬁnitely small, and hence equal to zero,
still there is a ﬁnite ratio between them. That is, dy : dx = P : 1. Once we
have found the function P, then we know the ratio between the diﬀerential
dx and the diﬀerential dy. Since diﬀerential calculus consists in ﬁnding
diﬀerentials, the work involved is not in ﬁnding the diﬀerentials themselves,
which are both equal to zero, but rather in their mutual geometric ratio.
121.
Diﬀerentials are much easier to ﬁnd than ﬁnite diﬀerences. For the
ﬁnite diﬀerence ∆y by which a function increases when the variable quan-
tity x increases by ω, it is not suﬃcient to know P, but we must investigate
also the functions Q, R, S, . . . that enter into the ﬁnite diﬀerence that we
have expressed as
Pω + Qω2 + Rω3 + · · · .
For the diﬀerential of y we need only to know the function P. For this
reason, from our knowledge of the ﬁnite diﬀerence of any function of x
we can easily deﬁne its diﬀerential. On the other hand, from a function’s
diﬀerential it is not possible to ﬁgure out its ﬁnite diﬀerence. Nevertheless,
we shall see (in paragraph 49 of the second part) that from a knowledge
of the diﬀerentials of all orders it is possible to ﬁnd the ﬁnite diﬀerence of
any given function. Now, from what we have seen, it is clear that the ﬁrst
diﬀerential dy = P dx gives the ﬁrst term of the ﬁnite diﬀerence, that is,
Pω.
122.
If the increment ω by which the variable x is considered to be in-
creased happens to be very small, so that in the expression Pω + Qω2 +
Rω3 +· · · the terms Qω2 and Rω3, and even more so the remaining terms,
become so small in comparison to Pω that they can be neglected in compu-
tations where rigor is not so important, in this case when we know the dif-
ferential Pdx we also know approximately the ﬁnite diﬀerence Pω. Hence,
in many cases we can use calculus in applications with no little proﬁt. There
are some who judge that diﬀerentials are very small increments, but they
deny that they are actually equal to zero, and so they say that they are only
indeﬁnitely small. This idea presents to others an occasion to blame anal-
ysis of the inﬁnite for not obtaining exact, but only approximate, results.
This objection has some justiﬁcation unless we insist that the inﬁnitely
small is absolutely equal to zero.
123.
Those who are unwilling to admit that the inﬁnitely small becomes
nothing, in order that they might seem to meet the objection, compare
diﬀerentials to the very smallest speck of dust in relation to the whole earth.
One is thought not to have given the true bulk of the earth who departs

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
67
by one speck from the truth. They want such a ratio between a ﬁnite
quantity and one inﬁnitely small to be as is the ratio between the whole
earth and the smallest speck. If there is someone for whom this diﬀerence
is not suﬃciently large, then let the ratio be magniﬁed by even more than
a thousand, so that the smallness cannot possibly be observed. However,
they are forced to admit that geometrical rigor has been a bit compromised,
and to meet this objection they turn to such examples as they may ﬁnd
from geometry or analysis of the inﬁnite; from any agreement between these
latter methods they try to draw some good. This argument does not work,
since they frequently try to draw the truth from erroneous arguments.
In order that an argument avoid this diﬃculty and even be completely
successful, those quantities that we neglect in our calculations must not
be just incomprehensibly small, but they must be actually nothing, as we
have assumed. In this way geometric rigor suﬀers absolutely no violence.
124. Let us move on to an explanation of diﬀerentials of the second order.
These arise from second diﬀerences, which were treated in the ﬁrst chapter,
when we let ω become the inﬁnitely small dx. If we suppose that the variable
x increases by equal increments, then the second value xI becomes equal to
x + dx, and the following will be xII = x + 2dx, xIII = x + 3dx, . . . . Since
the ﬁrst diﬀerences dx are constant, the second diﬀerences vanish, and so
the second diﬀerential of x, that is, d2x, is equal to 0. For this reason all of
the other diﬀerentials of x are equal to 0, namely, d3x = 0, d4x = 0, d5x =
0, . . . . One could object that since diﬀerentials are inﬁnitely small, for that
reason alone they are equal to 0, so that there is nothing special about
the variable x, whose increments are considered to be equal. However, this
vanishing should be interpreted as due not only to the fact that d2x, d3x, . . .
are nothing in themselves, but also by reason of the powers of dx, which
vanish when compared to dx itself.
125.
In order that this may become clearer, let us recall that the second
diﬀerence of any function y of x can be expressed as Pω2+Qω3+Rω4+· · · .
Hence, if ω should be inﬁnitely small, then the terms Qω3, Rω4, . . . vanish
when compared with the ﬁrst term Pω2, so that with ω = dx, the second
diﬀerential of y will be equal to P dx2, where dx2 means the square of the
diﬀerential dx. It follows that although the second diﬀerential of y, namely
d2y, by itself is equal to 0, still, since d2y = P dx2, d2y has a ﬁnite ratio
to dx2, that is, as P to 1. However, since y = x, we have P = 0, Q = 0,
R = 0, . . . , so that in this case the second diﬀerential of x vanishes, even
with respect to dx2, and so do the other higher powers of dx. This is the
sense in which we should understand what was stated previously, namely,
d2x = 0, d3x = 0, . . . .
126. Since the second diﬀerence is just the diﬀerence of the ﬁrst diﬀerence,
the second diﬀerential, or, as it is frequently called, the diﬀerentiodiﬀeren-
tial, is the diﬀerential of the ﬁrst diﬀerential. Now, since a constant function

68
4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
undergoes no increment or decrement, it has no diﬀerences. Strictly speak-
ing, only variable quantities have diﬀerentials, but we say that constant
quantities have diﬀerentials of all orders equal to 0, and hence all powers
of dx vanish. Since the diﬀerential of dx, that is d2x, is equal to 0, the
diﬀerential dx can be thought of as a constant quantity; as long as the
diﬀerential of any quantity is constant, then that quantity is understood
to be taking on equal increments. Here we are taking x to be the quantity
whose diﬀerential is constant, and thus we estimate the variability of all
the functions on which the diﬀerentials depend.
127.
We let the ﬁrst diﬀerential of y be p dx. In order to ﬁnd the second
diﬀerential we have to ﬁnd the diﬀerential of p dx. Since dx is a constant
and does not change, even though we write x + dx for x, we need only ﬁnd
the diﬀerential of the ﬁrst quantity p. Now let dp = q dx, since we have seen
that the diﬀerential of every function of x can be put into this form. From
what we have shown for ﬁnite diﬀerences, we see that the diﬀerential of np
is equal to nq dx, where n is a constant quantity. We substitute dx for the
constant n, so that the diﬀerential of p dx is equal to q dx2. For this reason,
if dy = p dx and dp = q dx, then the second diﬀerential d2y = q dx2, and
so it is clear, as we indicated before, that the second diﬀerential of y has a
ﬁnite ratio to dx2.
128. In the ﬁrst chapter we noticed that the second and higher diﬀerences
cannot be determined unless the successive values of x are assumed to follow
some rule; since this rule is arbitrary, we have decided that the best and
easiest rule is that of an arithmetic progression. For the same reason we
cannot state anything certain about second diﬀerentials unless the ﬁrst
diﬀerentials, by which the variable x is thought to increase constantly,
follow the stated rule. Hence we suppose that the ﬁrst diﬀerentials of x,
namely, dx, dxI, dxII, . . . , are all equal to each other, so that the second
diﬀerentials are given by
d2x = dxI −dx = 0,
d2xI = dxII −dxI = 0,
. . . .
Since the second diﬀerentials, and those of higher order, depend on the
order by which the diﬀerentials of x are mutually related, and this order
is arbitrary, ﬁrst diﬀerentials are not aﬀected by this, and this is the huge
diﬀerence between the method for ﬁnding ﬁrst diﬀerentials and those of
higher order.
129.
If the successive values of x, namely, x, xI, xII, xIII, xIV, . . . , do
not form an arithmetic progression, but follow some other rule, then their
ﬁrst diﬀerentials, namely, dx, dxI, dxII, . . . , will not be equal to each other,
and so we do not have d2x = 0. For this reason the second diﬀerentials
are functions of x with a diﬀerent form. If the ﬁrst diﬀerential of such a
function y is equal to p dx, to ﬁnd the second diﬀerential it is not enough to
multiply the diﬀerential of p by dx, but we must also take the diﬀerential

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
69
of dx, that is, d2x into account. Since the second diﬀerential arises from
the diﬀerence when p dx is subtracted from its successor, which we obtain
by substituting x+dx for x and dx+d2x for dx, we suppose that the value
of this successor of p has the form p + q dx, and the successor of p dx has
the form
(p + q dx)

dx + d2x

= p dx + p d2x + q dx2 + q dx d2x.
When we subtract p dx from this we have the second diﬀerential
d2y = p d2x + q dx2 + q dx d2x = p d2x + q dx2
since q dx d2x vanishes when compared to p d2x.
130.
Although it is simplest and most convenient to have the increments
of x equal to each other, nevertheless it is frequently the case that y is
not directly a function of x, but a function of some other quantity that
is a function of x. Furthermore, frequently it is speciﬁed that the ﬁrst
diﬀerentials of this other quantity should be equal, but their relation to x
may not be clear. In the previous case the second and following diﬀerentials
of x depend on a relationship that x has with that quantity, and we suppose
that the change is by equal increments. In this other case the second and
following diﬀerentials of x are considered to be unknowns, and we use the
symbols d2x, d3x, d4x, . . . .
131. The methods by which these diﬀerentiations in the diﬀerent cases are
to be treated we shall discuss at length later. Now we will proceed under
the assumption that x increases uniformly, so that the ﬁrst diﬀerentials
dx, dxI, dII, . . . are equal to each other, so that the second and higher
diﬀerentials are equal to zero. We can state this condition by saying that
the diﬀerential of x, that is dx, is assumed to be constant. Let y be any
function of x; since the function is deﬁned by x and constants, its ﬁrst,
second, third, fourth, and so forth, diﬀerentials can be expressed in terms
of x and dx. For example, if in y we substitute x + dx for x and subtract
the original value of y, there remains the ﬁrst diﬀerential dy. If in this
diﬀerential we substitute x + dx for x, we obtain dyI and d2y = dyI −dy.
In a similar way, by substituting x + dx for x in d2y we obtain d2yI and
d2yI −d2y = d3y, and so forth. In all of the calculations dx is always seen
as a constant whose diﬀerential vanishes.
132.
From the deﬁnition of y, a function of x, we determine the value of
the function p, which when multiplied by dx gives the ﬁrst diﬀerential dy.
We can determine p either by the method of ﬁnite diﬀerences, or by a much
more expeditious method that we will discuss later. Given dy = p dx, the
diﬀerential of p dx gives the second diﬀerential d2y. Hence, if dp = q dx,
since dx is constant, we have d2y = q dx2, as we have already shown. Taking
another step, since the diﬀerential of the second diﬀerential gives the third

70
4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
diﬀerential, we let dq = r dx, so that d3y = r dx3. In like manner, if the
diﬀerential of this function r is sought, it will be dr = s dx, from which we
obtain the fourth diﬀerential d4y = s dx4, and so forth. Provided that we
can ﬁnd the ﬁrst diﬀerential of any function, we can ﬁnd the diﬀerential of
any order.
133.
In order that we may keep the form of these diﬀerentials, and the
method of discovery, in mind we present the following table: If y is any
function of x,
then
and we let
dy = p dx,
dp = q dx,
d2y = q dx2,
dq = r dx,
d3y = r dx3,
dr = s dx,
d4y = s dx4,
ds = t dx,
d5y = t dx5,
. . . .
Since the function p is known from y by diﬀerentiation, similarly we ﬁnd
q from p, then r from q, then s, and so forth. We can ﬁnd diﬀerentials of
any order, provided only that the diﬀerential dx remains constant.
134.
Since p, q, r, s, t, . . . are ﬁnite quantities, in particular, functions
of x, the ﬁrst diﬀerential of y has a ﬁnite ratio to the ﬁrst diﬀerential of
x, that is, as p to 1. For this reason, the diﬀerentials dx and dy are said
to be homogeneous. Then, since d2y has the ﬁnite ratio to dx2 as q to 1,
it follows that d2y and dx2 are homogeneous. Similarly, d3y and dx3 as
well as d4y and dx4 are homogeneous, and so forth. Hence, just as ﬁrst
diﬀerentials are mutually homogeneous, that is, they have a ﬁnite ratio, so
second diﬀerentials with the squares of ﬁrst diﬀerentials, third diﬀerentials
with cubes of ﬁrst diﬀerentials, and so forth, are homogeneous. In general,
the diﬀerential of y of the nth order, expressed as dny, is homogeneous with
dxn, that is, with the nth power of dx.
135.
Since in comparison with dx all of its powers greater than 1 vanish,
so also in comparison with dy all of the powers dx2, dx3, dx4, . . . vanish,
as well as the diﬀerentials of higher orders that have ﬁnite ratios with
these, that is, d2y, d3y, d4y, . . . . In a similar way, in comparison with d2y,
since this is homogeneous with dx2, all powers of dx that are greater than
the second, dx3, dx4, . . . , will vanish. Along with these will vanish d3y,
d4y, . . . . Furthermore, compared to d3y, we have dx4, d4y, dx5, d5y, . . . all
vanishing. Hence, given expressions involving diﬀerentials of this kind, it
is easy to decide whether or not they are homogeneous. We have only to
consider the diﬀerentials, since the ﬁnite parts do not disturb homogeneity.

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
71
For diﬀerentials of the second and higher order, consider the powers of dx;
if the numbers are the same, the expressions are homogeneous.
136. Thus it is clear that the expressions P d2y2 and Q dy d3y are mutually
homogeneous. For d2y2 is the square of d2y, and since d2y is homogeneous
with dx2, it follows that d2y2 is homogeneous with dx4. Thus, since dy
is homogeneous with dx and d3y is homogeneous with dx3, we have that
the product dy d3y is homogeneous with dx4. From this it follows that
P d2y2 and Q dy d3y are mutually homogeneous, and so their ratio is ﬁnite.
Similarly, we gather that the expressions
P d3y2
dx d2y
and
Q d5y
dy2
are homogeneous. If we substitute for dy, d2y, d3y, and d5y the powers of
dx that are homogeneous with them, namely, dx, dx2, dx3, and dx5, we
obtain the expressions P dx3 and Q dx3, which are mutually homogeneous.
137.
If after reduction the proposed expressions do not contain the same
powers of dx, then the expressions are not homogeneous, nor is their ratio
ﬁnite. In this case one will be either inﬁnitely greater or inﬁnitely less than
the other, and so one will vanish with respect to the other. Thus P d3y/dx2
to Q d2y2/dy has a ratio inﬁnitely large. The former reduces to P dx and
the latter to Q dx3. It follows that the latter will vanish when compared
to the former. For this reason, if in some calculation the sum of these two
terms occurs
P d3y
dx2
+ Q d2y2
dy
,
the second term, compared to the ﬁrst, can safely be eliminated, and only
the ﬁrst term P d3y/dx2 is kept in the calculation. There is a perfect ratio
of equality between the expressions
P d3y
dx2
+ Q d2y2
dy
and
P d3y
dx2 ,
since when we express the ratio, we obtain
1 + Q dx2d2y2
P dy d3y
= 1,
because
Q dx2d2y2
P dy d3y
= 0.
In this way diﬀerential expressions can sometimes be wonderfully reduced.
138.
In diﬀerential calculus rules are given by means of which the ﬁrst
diﬀerential of a given quantity can be found. Since second diﬀerentials are
obtained by diﬀerentiating ﬁrst diﬀerentials, third diﬀerentials by the same
operation on seconds, and so forth, the next one from the one just found,

72
4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
diﬀerential calculus contains a method for ﬁnding all diﬀerentials of each
order. From the word diﬀerential, which denotes an inﬁnitely small diﬀer-
ence, we derive other names that have come into common usage. Thus we
have the word diﬀerentiate, which means to ﬁnd a diﬀerential. A quantity
is said to be diﬀerentiated when its diﬀerential is found. Diﬀerentiation
denotes the operation by which diﬀerentials are found. Hence diﬀerential
calculus is also called the method of diﬀerentiating, since it contains a way
of ﬁnding diﬀerentials.
139.
Just as in diﬀerential calculus the diﬀerential of any quantity is
investigated, so there is a kind of calculus that consists in ﬁnding a quantity
whose diﬀerential is one that is already given, and this is called integral
calculus. If any diﬀerential is given, that quantity whose diﬀerential is the
proposed quantity is called its integral. The reason for this name is as
follows: Since a diﬀerential can be thought of as an inﬁnitely small part by
which a quantity increases, that quantity with respect to which this is a
part can be thought of as a whole, that is, integral, and for this reason is
called an integral. Thus, since dy is the diﬀerential of y, y, in turn, is the
integral of dy. Since d2y is the diﬀerential of dy, dy is the integral of d2y.
Likewise, d2y is the integral of d3y, and d3y is the integral of d4y, and so
forth. It follows that any diﬀerentiation, from an inverse point of view, is
also an example of integration.
140.
The origin and nature of both integrals and diﬀerentials can most
clearly be explained from the theory of ﬁnite diﬀerences, which has been
discussed in the ﬁrst chapter. After it was shown how the diﬀerence of
any quantity should be found, going in reverse, we also showed how, from
a given diﬀerence, a quantity can be found whose diﬀerence is the one
proposed. We called that quantity, with respect to its diﬀerence, the sum
of the diﬀerence. Just as when we proceed to the inﬁnitely small, diﬀerences
become diﬀerentials, so the sums, which there were called just that, now
receive the name of integral. For this reason integrals are sometimes called
sums. The English call diﬀerentials by the name ﬂuxions, and integrals are
called by them ﬂuents. Their mode of speaking about ﬁnding the ﬂuent of
a given ﬂuxion is the same as ours when we speak of ﬁnding the integral
of a given diﬀerential.
141.
Just as we use the symbol d for a diﬀerential, so we use the symbol

to indicate an integral. Hence if this is placed before a diﬀerential, we
are indicating that quantity whose diﬀerential is the one given. Thus, if the
diﬀerential of y is p dx, that is, dy = p dx, then y is the integral of p dx.
This is expressed as follows: y =

p dx, since y =

dy. Hence, the integral
of p dx, symbolized by

p dx, is that quantity whose diﬀerential is p dx.
In a similar way if d2y = q dx, where dp = q dx, then the integral of d2y
is dy, which is equal to p dx. Since p =

q dx, we have dy = dx

q dx,
and hence y =

dx

q dx. If in addition, dq = r dx, then q =

r dx and

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
73
dp = dx

r dx, so that if we place the symbol

before both sides, we
have p =

dx

r dx. Finally, we have dy = dx

dx

r dx and so y =

dx

dx

r dx.
142.
Since the diﬀerential dy is an inﬁnitely small quantity, its integral y
is a ﬁnite quantity. In like manner the second diﬀerential d2y is inﬁnitely
less that its integral dy. It should be clear that a diﬀerential will vanish in
the presence of its integral. In order that this relation be better understood,
the inﬁnitely small can be categorized by orders. First diﬀerentials are said
to be inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst order; the inﬁnitely small of the second
order consist of diﬀerentials of the second order, which are homogeneous
with dx2. Similarly, the inﬁnitely small that are homogeneous with dx3
are said to be of the third order, and these include all diﬀerentials of the
third order, and so forth. Hence, just as the inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst
order vanish in the presence of ﬁnite quantities, so the inﬁnitely small of
the second order vanishes in the presence of the inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst
order. In general, the inﬁnitely small of any higher order vanishes in the
presence of an inﬁnitely small of a lower order.
143. Once the orders of the inﬁnitely small have been established, so that
the diﬀerential of a ﬁnite quantity is inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst order, and
so forth, conversely, the integral of an inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst order is a
ﬁnite quantity. The integral of an inﬁnitely small of the second order is an
inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst order, and so forth. Hence if a given diﬀerential is
inﬁnitely small of order n, then its integral will be inﬁnitely small of order
n −1. Thus, just as diﬀerentiating increases the order of the inﬁnitely
small, so integrating lowers the order until we come to a ﬁnite quantity. If
we wished to integrate again ﬁnite quantities, then according to this law
we obtain quantities inﬁnitely large. From the integration of these we get
quantities inﬁnitely greater still. Proceeding in this way we obtain orders
of inﬁnity such that each one is inﬁnitely greater than its predecessor.
144.
It remains to give something of a warning about the use of symbols
in this chapter, lest there still be any ambiguity. First of all, the symbol
for diﬀerentiation, d, operates on only the letter that comes immediately
after it. Thus, dx y does not mean the diﬀerential of the product xy, but
rather the product of y and the diﬀerential of x. In order to minimize the
confusion we ordinarily would write this with the y preceding the symbol
d, as y dx, by which we indicate the product of y and dx. If y happens to be
a quantity preceded by a symbol indicating either a root √or a logarithm,
then we usually place that after the diﬀerential. For instance, dx
√
a2 −x2
signiﬁes the product of the ﬁnite quantity
√
a2 −x2 and the diﬀerential dx.
In like manner, dx ln (1 + x) is the product of the logarithm of the quantity
1 + x and dx. For the same reason d2y√x expresses the product of the
second diﬀerential d2y and the ﬁnite quantity √x.

74
4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
145.
The symbol d does not aﬀect only the letter immediately following
it, but also the exponent on that letter if it has one. Thus, dx2 does not
express the diﬀerential of x2, but the square of the diﬀerential of x, so that
the exponent 2 refers not to x but to dx. We could write this as dx dx in
the same way as we would write the product of two diﬀerentials dx and
dy as dx dy. The previous method, dx2, has the advantage of being both
briefer and more usual. Especially if it is a question of higher powers of
dx, the method of repeating so many times tends to be too long. Thus,
dx3 denotes the cube of dx; we observe the same reasoning with regard to
diﬀerentials of higher order. For example, d2y4 denotes the fourth power
of the second-order diﬀerential d2y, and d3y2√x symbolizes the product of
the square of the diﬀerential of the third order of y and √x. If it were the
product with the rational quantity x then we would write it as x d3y2.
146. If we want the symbol d to aﬀect more than the next letter, we need
a special way of indicating that. In this case we will use parentheses to in-
clude the expression whose diﬀerential we need to express. Then d

x2 + y2
means the diﬀerential of the quantity x2 + y2. It is true enough that if we
want to designate the diﬀerential of a power of such an expression, then
ambiguity can hardly be avoided. If we write d

x2 + y22, this could be
understood to mean the square of d

x2 + y2
. On the other hand, we can
avoid this diﬃculty with the use of a dot, so that d.

x2 + y22 means the
diﬀerential of

x2 + y22. If the dot is missing, then d

x2 + y22 indicates
the square of d

x2 + y2
. The dot conveniently indicates that the symbol
d applies to the whole expression after the dot. Thus, d.x dy expresses the
diﬀerential of x dy, and d3.x dy
√
a2 + x2 is the third-order diﬀerential of
the expression x dy
√
a2 + x2, which is the product of the ﬁnite quantities
x and
√
a2 + x2 and the diﬀerential dy.
147.
On the one hand, the symbol for diﬀerentiation d aﬀects only the
quantity immediately following it, unless a dot intervenes and extends its
inﬂuence to the whole following expression; on the other hand, the inte-
gral sign

always extends to the whole expression that follows. Thus,

y dx

a2 −x2n denotes the integral of, or the quantity whose diﬀerential
is, y dx

a2 −x2n. The expression

x dx

dx ln x denotes the quantity
whose diﬀerential is x dx

dx ln x. Hence, if we wish to express the prod-
uct of two integrals, for instance

y dx and

z dx, it would be wrong to
write

y dx

z dx. This would be understood as the integral of y dx

z dx.
For this reason we again use a dot to remove any ambiguity, so that

y dx ·

z dx signiﬁes the product of the integrals

y dx and

z dx.
148.
Now, analysis of the inﬁnite is concerned with the discovery of both
diﬀerentials and integrals, and for this reason it is divided into two principal
parts, one of which is called diﬀerential calculus, and the other is integral
calculus. In the former, rules are given for ﬁnding diﬀerentials of any quan-

4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
75
tity. In the latter a way of investigating integrals of given diﬀerentials is
shown. In both parts there are indications of the best applications to both
analysis itself and higher geometry. For this reason even this ﬁrst part of
analysis has already grown so that to cover it requires no small book. In
the integral calculus both new methods of integration are being discovered
every day, as well as the revelation of new aids for the solution of diﬀerent
kinds of problems. Due to the new discoveries that are continuously being
made, we could never exhaust, much less describe and explain perfectly, all
of this. Nevertheless I will make every eﬀort in these books to make sure
that either everything that has so far been discovered shall be presented,
or at least the methods by which they can be deduced are explained.
149.
It is common to give other parts of analysis of the inﬁnite. Besides
diﬀerential and integral calculus, one sometimes ﬁnds diﬀerentio-diﬀerential
calculus and exponential calculus. In diﬀerentio-diﬀerential calculus the
methods of ﬁnding second and higher diﬀerentials are usually discussed.
Since the method of ﬁnding diﬀerentials of any order will be discussed in
this diﬀerential calculus, this subdivision, which seems to be based more
on the importance of its discovery rather than the thing itself, we will
omit. The illustrious Johann Bernoulli, to whom we are eternally grateful
for innumerable and great discoveries in analysis of the inﬁnite, extended
the methods of diﬀerentiating and integrating to exponential quantities by
means of exponential calculus. Since I plan to treat in both parts of calculus
not only algebraic but also transcendental quantities, this special part has
become superﬂuous and outside our plan.
150.
I have decided to treat diﬀerential calculus ﬁrst. I will explain the
method by which not only ﬁrst diﬀerentials but also second and higher
diﬀerentials of variable quantities can be expeditiously found. I will begin
by considering algebraic quantities, whether they be explicitly given or im-
plicitly by equations. Then I will extend the discovery of diﬀerentials to
nonalgebraic quantities, at least to those which can be known without the
aid of integral calculus. Quantities of this kind are logarithms and expo-
nential quantities, as well as arcs of circles and in turn sines and tangents of
circular arcs. Finally, we will teach how to diﬀerentiate compositions and
mixtures of all of these quantities. In short, this ﬁrst part of diﬀerential
calculus will be concerned with diﬀerentiating.
151.
The second part will be dedicated to the explanation of the applica-
tions of the method of diﬀerentiating to both analysis and higher geometry.
Many nice things spill over into ordinary algebra: ﬁnding roots of equations,
discussing and summing series, discovering maxima and minima, deﬁning
and discovering values of expressions that in some cases seem to defy de-
termination. Higher geometry has received its greatest development from
diﬀerential calculus. By its means tangents to curves and their curvature
can be deﬁned with marvelous facility. Many other problems concerned

76
4. On the Nature of Diﬀerentials of Each Order
with either reﬂex or refracted radii of curves can be solved. Although a
long treatise could be devoted to all of this, I will endeavor, as far as pos-
sible, to give a brief and clear account.

5
On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic
Functions of One Variable
152.
Since the diﬀerential of the variable x is equal to dx, when x is
incremented, x becomes equal to x + dx. Hence, if y is some function of x,
and if we substitute x + dx for x, we obtain yI. The diﬀerence yI −y gives
the diﬀerential of y. Now if we let y = xn, then
yI = (x + dx)n = xn + nxn−1dx + n (n −1)
1 · 2
xn−2dx2 + · · · ,
and so
dy = yI −y = nxn−1dx + n (n −1)
1 · 2
xn−2dx2 + · · · .
In this expression the second term and all succeeding terms vanish in the
presence of the ﬁrst term. Hence, nxn−1dx is the diﬀerential of xn, or
d.xn = nxn−1dx.
It follows that if a is a number or constant quantity, then we also have
d.axn = naxn−1dx. Therefore, the diﬀerential of any power of x is found
by multiplying that power by the exponent, dividing by x, and multiplying
the result by dx. This rule can easily be memorized.
153.
Once we know the ﬁrst diﬀerential of xn, it is easy to ﬁnd its sec-
ond diﬀerential, provided that we assume that the diﬀerential dx remains
constant. Since in the diﬀerential nxn−1dx the factor n dx is constant,
the diﬀerential of the other factor xn−1 must be taken, which will be

78
5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
(n −1) xn−2dx. When this is multiplied by n dx, we have the second dif-
ferential
d2.xn = n (n −1) xn−2dx2.
In a similar way, if the diﬀerential of xn−2, which is equal to (n −2) xn−3dx,
is multiplied by n (n −1) dx2, we have the third diﬀerential
d3.xn = n (n −1) (n −2) xn−3dx3.
Furthermore, the fourth diﬀerential will be
d4.xn = n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3) xn−4dx4,
and the ﬁfth diﬀerential is
d5.xn = n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3) (n −4) xn−5dx5.
The form of the following diﬀerentials is easily understood.
154.
As long as n is a positive integer, eventually the higher diﬀerentials
will vanish; these are equal to 0, because diﬀerentials of higher powers of
dx vanish. We should note a few of the simpler cases:
d.x = dx,
d2.x = 0,
d3.x = 0,
. . . ,
d.x2 = 2x dx,
d2.x2 = 2dx2,
d3.x2 = 0,
d4.x2 = 0, . . . ,
d.x3 = 3x2dx,
d2.x3 = 6x dx2,
d3.x3 = 6dx3,
d4.x3 = 0, . . . ,
d.x4 = 4x3dx,
d2.x4 = 12x2dx2,
d3.x4 = 24x dx3,
d4.x4 = 24dx4,
d5.x4 = 0
. . . ,
d.x5 = 5x4dx,
d2.x5 = 20x3dx2,
d3.x5 = 60x2dx3,
d4.x5 = 120x dx4,
d5.x5 = 120dx5,
d6.x5 = 0,
. . . .
It is clear that if n is a positive integer, then the diﬀerential of order n of
xn will be a constant, that is, it will be equal to 1·2·3 · · · n dxn. The result
is that all diﬀerentials of higher order will be equal to 0.
155. If n is a negative integer, diﬀerentials of x with such negative powers
can be taken, such as
1
x,
1
x2 ,
1
x3 ,
. . . ,
since

x = x−1,

x2 = x−2,

and generally,
1
xm = x−m.
If we substitute in the previous formula −m for n, we have the ﬁrst diﬀer-
ential of 1/xm equal to
−m dx
xm+1 ;
the second diﬀerential is equal to
m (m + 1) dx2
xm+2
;
the third diﬀerential is equal to
−m (m + 1) (m + 2) dx3
xm+3
;
and so forth. The following simpler cases deserve to be noted:

156.
Then if we let n be a fraction, we obtain diﬀerentials of irrational
expressions. If n = µ/ν, then the ﬁrst diﬀerential of xµ/ν, that is

xµ, is
equal to
µ
ν x(µ−ν)/νdx = µ

If we inspect these expressions a bit, we can easily ﬁnd the diﬀerentials,
even without putting the expression into exponential form.
157. If µ is not 1, but some other integer, whether positive or negative, the
diﬀerentials can be deﬁned just as easily. Since the second- and higher-order
diﬀerentials are deﬁned from the ﬁrst, using the same law of exponents, we
put down a few of the simpler examples of only ﬁrst diﬀerentials.

158. From functions of this kind we can ﬁnd the diﬀerentials of all rational
algebraic functions, since each of their terms is a power of x, which we know
how to diﬀerentiate. Suppose we have a quantity of the form
p + q + r + s + · · · .
When we substitute x + dx for x we obtain
p + dp + q + dq + r + dr + s + ds + · · · ,

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
81
so that its diﬀerential is equal to
dp + dq + dr + ds + · · · .
Hence, if we can give the diﬀerential of each quantity p, q, r, s, then we
know the diﬀerential of the sum. Furthermore, since the diﬀerential of a
multiple of p is the same multiple of dp, we have d.ap = a dp, and the
diﬀerential of ap + bq + cr is equal to a dp + b dq + c dr. Finally, since the
diﬀerentials of constants are zero, the diﬀerential of ap+bq+cr+f is equal
to a dp + b dq + c dr.
159. In polynomial functions, since each term is either a constant or power
of x, diﬀerentiation according to the given rule is easily carried out. Thus
we have
d (a + x) = dx,
d (a + bx) = b dx,
d

d

a + bx + cx2 + ex3 + fx4
= b dx + 2cx dx + 3ex2dx + 4fx3dx.
If the exponents are indeﬁnite, then
d (1 −xn) = −nxn−1dx,
d (1 + xm) = mxm−1dx,
d (a + bxm + cxn) = mbxm−1dx + ncxn−1dx.
160. Since the degree of a polynomial is given by the term with the highest
power of x, it is clear that if diﬀerentials of such functions are continually
taken, the diﬀerential will eventually become constant and then vanish,
provided that we assume that dx is constant. Thus the ﬁrst diﬀerential of a
ﬁrst degree polynomial a + bx, b dx, is constant, and the second and higher
diﬀerentials vanish. Let a + bx + cx2 = y be a second-degree polynomial.
Then
dy = b dx + 2cx dx,
d2y = 2c dx2,
d3y = 0.

82
5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
Likewise, if a + bx + cx2 + ex3 = y is a third-degree polynomial, then
dy = b dx + 2cx dx + 3ex2dx
d2y = 2c dx2 + 6ex dx2,
d3y = 6e dx3,
d4y = 0.
In general, if the function is of degree n, then its diﬀerential of order n will
be constant, and higher-order diﬀerentials will all vanish.

Further examples of this kind are easily treated according to the given laws.
162. If the quantity proposed for diﬀerentiation is the power of some func-
tion whose diﬀerential we can ﬁnd, then the preceding rules are suﬃcient
to ﬁnd the ﬁrst diﬀerential. Let p be any function of x that is raised to
some power and whose diﬀerential is dp. Then the ﬁrst diﬀerential of pn is
equal to npn−1dp. From this we obtain the following.

In a similar way, by substituting individual letters for terms to be com-
posed, we can easily ﬁnd the diﬀerentials of this kind of function.
163.
If the quantity that is to be diﬀerentiated is the product of two or
more functions of x whose diﬀerentials are known, the most convenient
method for ﬁnding the diﬀerential is as follows. Let p and q be functions of
x with diﬀerentials dp and dq already known. When we substitute x+dx for

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
85
x, p becomes p + dp, and q becomes q + dq. The product pq is transformed
into
(p + dp) (q + dq) = pq + p dq + q dp + dp dq.
Hence, the diﬀerential of the product pq is equal to p dq + q dp + dp dq.
Since p dq and q dp are inﬁnitely small of the ﬁrst order, while dp dq is of
the second order, the last term vanishes, with the result that
d.pq = p dq + q dp.
It follows that the diﬀerential of the product pq consists of two members,
each of which is one factor multiplied by the diﬀerential of the other. From
this we easily deduce the diﬀerential of the triple product pqr. If we let
qr = z, then pqr = pz and d.pqr = p dz + z dp. Since z = qr, we have
dz = q dr + r dq, and after substituting for z and dz, we have
d.pqr = pq dr + pr dq + qr dp.
In a similar way, if the quantity to be diﬀerentiated is a fourfold product,
then we have
d.pqrs = pqr ds + pqs dr + prs dq + qrs dp.
From this it should be easily seen what the diﬀerential of a product of many
factors will be.
I. If y = (a + x) (b −x), then
dy = −dx (a + x) + dx (b −x) = −a dx + b dx −2x dx.
This same diﬀerential can be found by expanding the expression to
y = ab −ax + bx −x2, so that by the previous rule,
dy = −a dx + b dx −2x dx.

Although the quotient of two functions can be thought of as the
product of two functions, it may be more convenient to use a rule for
diﬀerentiating a quotient. Let p/q be a given function whose diﬀerential we
need to ﬁnd. When we substitute x + dx for x the quotient becomes1
p + dp
q + dq = (p + dp)
1
q −dq
q2

= p
q −p dq
q2 + dp
q −dp dq

.
When p/q is subtracted, the diﬀerential remains,
d.p
q = dp
q −p dq
q2 ,
since the term dp dq/q2 vanishes. Hence, we have
d.p
q = q dp −p dq
q2
,
and the rule for quotients can be stated:
To obtain the diﬀerential of a quotient, from the product of the
denominator and the diﬀerential of the numerator we subtract
the product of the numerator and the diﬀerential of the denom-
inator. Then the remainder is divided by the square of the de-
nominator.
The following examples illustrate the application of this rule.

Frequently, it may be more expeditious to use the rule in its earlier form

so that the diﬀerential of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the dif-
ferential of the numerator by the denominator minus the quotient of the

This should be suﬃcient for the investigation of diﬀerentials of ra-
tional functions. If the function happens to be a polynomial, we have said
enough. If the function is a quotient, it can always be reduced to the fol-
lowing form:
y = A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3 + Ex4 + Fx5 + · · ·
α + βx + γx2 + δx3 + ϵx4 + ζx5 + · · ·
.
We let the numerator be equal to p and the denominator be equal to q, so
that y = p/q and
dy = q dp −p dq
q2
.
But since
p = A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3 + Ex4 + · · ·
and
q = α + βx + γx2 + δx3 + ϵx4 + · · · ,
we have
dp = B dx + 2Cx dx + 3Dx2dx + 4Ex3dx + · · ·
and
dq = β dx + 2γx dx + 3δx2dx + 4ϵx3dx + · · · .

By multiplication we obtain
q dp = αB dx + 2αCx dx + 3αDx2dx + 4αEx3dx + · · ·

+ 4ϵAx3dx + · · · .
From these we obtain the desired diﬀerential dy, which is the quotient
whose numerator is equal to
(αB −βA) dx + (2αC −2γA) x dx + (3αD + βC −γB −3δA) x2dx
+ (4αE + 2βD −2δB −4ϵA) x3dx

and whose denominator is equal to

α + βx + γx2 + δx3 + ϵx4 + ζx5 + · · ·
2 .
This expression is most accommodated to the expeditious diﬀerentiation
of any rational function. Since the numerator of the diﬀerential is made
up from coeﬃcients of the numerator and denominator functions, it can be
obtained by inspection. The denominator of the diﬀerential is the square
of the denominator of the given function.
166.
If in the given quotient either the numerator or the denominator, or
both, is made up of a product, then when the multiplication is performed
we have a form we have already diﬀerentiated. However, we give special
rules to make it easier to cover these cases.
Suppose the given quotient has the form y = pr/q. We let pr = P. Then
dP = p dr + r dp.
Since y = P/q, we have
dy = q dP −P dq
q2
,
and after substituting for P and dP, we have the following result:

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
91
I. If y = pr
q , then
dy = pq dr + qr dp −pr dq
q2
.
If y = p
qs, we let qs = Q, so that
dQ = q ds + s dq
and
dy = Q dp −p dQ
q2s2
.
It follows that:
II. If y = p
qs, then
dy = qs dp −pq ds −ps dq
q2s2
.
If y = pr
qs, again, we let pr = P and qs = Q, so that y = P
Q and
dy = Q dP −P dQ
Q2
.
Since
dP = p dr + r dp
and
dQ = q ds + s dq,
we obtain the following diﬀerentiation:
III. If y = pr
qs, then
dy = pqs dr + qrs dp −pqr ds −prs dq
q2s2
,
or
dy = r dp
qs + p dr
qs −pr dq
q2s −pr ds
qs2 .
In a similar way, if the numerator and denominator of the quotient con-
tained several factors, using the same reasoning we could investigate the
diﬀerential. It does not seem to be necessary that one be led by hand
through the argument. For this reason we omit any examples of this kind,

92
5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
especially since we will soon give a general method that will comprehend
all of these special methods of diﬀerentiating.
167.
There are some cases in which the diﬀerential can be more easily
expressed than with the general rules we have given; these would be either
products or quotients in which the factors that make up the product or the
numerator or denominator of the quotient are powers.
We suppose that the function that is to be diﬀerentiated is y = pmqn.
To ﬁnd the diﬀerential of this function we let pm = P and qn = Q, so that
y = PQ
and
dy = P dQ + Q dP.
Since
dP = mpm−1dp
and
dQ = nqn−1dq,
when we substitute these values, we obtain
dy = npmqn−1dq + mpm−1qn dp = pm−1qn−1 (np dq + mq dp) .
From this result we derive the following rule:
I. If y = pmqn, then
dy = pm−1qn−1 (np dq + mq dp) .
In a similar way, if there are three factors, the diﬀerential can be found
and expressed as follows:
II. If y = pmqnrk, then
dy = pm−1qn−1rk−1 (mqr dp + npr dq + kpq dr) .
168.
If a quotient has either a numerator or a denominator that has a
factor that is a power, we can give special rules.
First we suppose that the quotient has the form y = pm/q. Then from
the general rule for quotients we have
dy = mpm−1q dp −pmdq
q2
,
but this diﬀerential can be expressed more conveniently as:
I. If y = pm
q , then
dy = pm−1 (mq dp −p dq)
q2
.

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
93
If, on the other hand, y = p/qn, then by the general rule,
dy = qn dp −npqn−1dq
q2n
.
If we divide both numerator and denominator by qn−1 we have
dy = q dp −np dq
qn+1
.
We conclude:
II. If y = p
qn , then
dy = q dp −np dq
qn+1
.
If the given quotient is y = pm/qn, then we ﬁnd that
dy = mpm−1qn dp −npmqn−1dq
q2n
,
which reduces to
dy = mpm−1q dp −npm dq
qn+1
.
It follows that:
III. If y = pm
qn , then
dy = pm−1 (mq dp −np dq)
qn+1
.
Finally, if the given quotient is y = r/(pmqn), then by the general
quotient rule we have
dy = pmqn dr −mpm−1qnr dp −npmqn−1r dq
p2mq2n
.
Since both numerator and denominator are divisible by pm−1qn−1:
IV. If y =
r
pmqn , then
dy = pq dr −mqr dp −npr dq
pm+1qn+1
.

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
If several factors occur, this kind of special rule can easily be worked out,
so it is superﬂuous to say more.
169.
The rules for diﬀerentiating that we have presented so far are suﬃ-
cient to cover any algebraic function of x. If the function is a sum of powers
of x, this has been treated in paragraph 159; if the function is a quotient
of such functions, we have shown how to diﬀerentiate in paragraph 165.
We have also given an outline of diﬀerentiation when the function involves
factors. We have also taught how to diﬀerentiate irrational quantities, how-
soever they may aﬀect the function, whether through addition, subtraction,
multiplication, or division. We are always able to reduce the function to
cases already treated. We should understand that the reference is to ex-
plicit functions. As to implicit functions given by an equation, these we will
treat later, after we have taught how to diﬀerentiate functions of two or
more variables.
170.
If we carefully consider all of the rules we have given so far, and
we compare them with each other, we can reduce them to one universal
principle, which we will be able to prove rigorously in paragraph 214. In
the meantime it is not so diﬃcult to see intuitively that this is true. Any
algebraic function is composed of parts that are related to each other by
addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, and these parts are either
rational or irrational. We call those quantities that make up any function
its parts.
We diﬀerentiate any part of a given function by itself, as if it were the
only variable and the other parts were constants. Once we have the individ-
ual diﬀerentials of the parts making up the function, we put it all together
in a single sum, and thus we obtain the diﬀerential of the given function.
By means of these rules almost all functions can be diﬀerentiated, not
even excepting transcendental functions, as we shall show later.
171. In order to illustrate this rule, we suppose that the function consists
of two parts, connected by either addition or subtraction, so that
y = p ± q.
We suppose that the ﬁrst part p is the variable part and that the second
part q is the constant part, so that the diﬀerential is equal to dp. Then we
suppose that the second part ±q is the only variable, while the other part p
is constant, so that the diﬀerential is equal to ±dq. The desired diﬀerential
is put together from those two diﬀerentials, so that
dy = dp ± dq,
just as we have seen before. From this it must be perfectly clear that if the
function consists of several parts conjoined by either addition or subtrac-

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
95
tion, namely,
y = p ± q ± r ± s,
then by this rule we will have
dy = dp ± dq ± dr ± ds,
which is clear from the rule stated previously.
172.
If the parts are joined by multiplication, so that
y = pq,
it is clear that if we suppose that only the part p is variable, then the
diﬀerential will be equal to q dp. If the other part q is the only variable,
then the diﬀerential is equal to p dq. When we add these two diﬀerentials
we obtain the desired diﬀerential
dy = q dp + p dq,
just as we proposed above. If there are several parts joined by multiplica-
tion, for example,
y = pqrs,
and we successively let each part be variable, we obtain the diﬀerentials
qrs dp,
prs dq,
pqs dr,
pqr ds,
whose sum gives the desired diﬀerential
dy = qrs dp + prs dq + pqs dr + pqr ds,
as we have already seen. Therefore, the diﬀerential is obtained from the
diﬀerentials of all of the parts, whether they are joined by addition, sub-
traction, or multiplication.
173.
If the parts of the function are joined by division, for example,
y = p
q ,
according to the rule we ﬁrst let p be variable, and since q is constant,
the diﬀerential is equal to dp/q. Next we let q alone be variable, and since
y = pq−1, the diﬀerential is equal to −p dq/q2. When we join the two
diﬀerentials we have the diﬀerential of the given function
dy = dp
q −p dq
q2
= q dp −p dq
q2
,

96
5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
as we have seen before. In a similar way if the given function is
y = pq
rs,
we let each of the parts successively be variable and obtain the following
diﬀerentials:
q dp
rs ,
p dq
rs ,
−pq dr
r2s
,
−pq ds
rs2
.
It follows that
dy = qrs dp + prs dq −pqs dr −pqr ds
r2s2
.
174.
Provided only that each of the parts that make up a function are
such that we can ﬁnd their diﬀerentials, we can ﬁnd the diﬀerential of the
whole function. Hence, if the parts are integral powers, we can ﬁnd their
diﬀerentials not only by means of the laws we have given before, but also
from this general rule. If the parts are irrational, since the irrationality
comes from the fractional exponents, we can diﬀerentiate these through
the diﬀerentiation of powers, that is, d.xn = nxn−1dx. From this same well
we draw the diﬀerentiation of like irrational formulas that involve other
surds. Therefore, it should be clear that if with this general rule, which
will be proved later, we join the rule for diﬀerentiating powers, then the
diﬀerentials of absolutely all algebraic functions can be exhibited.
175.
From all of this it clearly follows that if y is any [algebraic] function
of x, its diﬀerential dy will have the form dy = p dx, where p can always
be found from the laws we have set down. Furthermore, the function p
is also an algebraic function of x, since in determining the diﬀerential no
other operations were used except the usual ones for algebraic functions.
For this reason if y is an algebraic function of x, then dy/dx is also an
algebraic function of x. Furthermore, if z is an algebraic function of x, such
that dz = q dx, since q is an algebraic function of x, we also know that
dz/dx is an algebraic function of x, and indeed so is dz/dy an algebraic
function of x which is equal to p/q. Hence, if the formula dz/dy is part of
some algebraic expression, this does not prevent the whole expression from
being algebraic, provided only that y and z are algebraic functions.
176.
We can extend this line of reasoning to second- and higher-order
diﬀerentials. If y is an algebraic function of x, dy = p dx and dp = q dx,
then with dx remaining constant, we have d2y = q dx2, as we have already
seen. Since for the reasons already given q is also an algebraic function of
x, it follows that d2y/dx2 is not only a ﬁnite quantity but also an algebraic
function of x, provided only that y is such a function. In a similar way we
see that
d3y
dx3 ,
d4y
dx4 ,
. . .

5. On the Diﬀerentiation of Algebraic Functions of One Variable
97
are algebraic functions of x, provided that y is such a function. Furthermore,
if z is also an algebraic function of x, all ﬁnite expressions made up of
diﬀerentials of any order of y, z, and dx, such as
d2y
d2z ,
d3y
dz d2y ,
dx d4y
dy3d2z ,
are all likewise algebraic functions of x.
177.
Since the ﬁrst diﬀerential of any algebraic function of x can now
be found by the method given, using the same method we can investigate
the second- and higher-order diﬀerentials. If y is any algebraic function of
x, from diﬀerentiation we have dy = p dx, and we note the value of p. If
we diﬀerentiate again and obtain dp = q dx, then d2y = q dx2, supposing
that dx is constant. In this way we have deﬁned the second diﬀerential.
When we diﬀerentiate q, so that dq = r dx, we have the third diﬀerential
d3y = r dx3. In this way we investigate the diﬀerentials of higher order,
and since the quantities p, q, r, . . . are all algebraic functions of x, the
given laws for diﬀerentiation are suﬃcient. Therefore, we have continuous
diﬀerentiation. If we omit the dx in the diﬀerentiation of y, we obtain the
value dy/dx = p, which is again diﬀerentiated and divided by dx to obtain
q = d2y/dx2. Each time we divide by dx, since everywhere the diﬀerential
dx is omitted. In a similar way we obtain r = d3y/dx3, and so forth.

Examples of this kind are useful not only for acquiring a habit of diﬀer-
entiating, but they also provide rules that are observed in diﬀerentials of
all orders, which are very much worth noticing and can lead to further
discoveries.

Besides the inﬁnite class of transcendental, or nonalgebraic, quanti-
ties that integral calculus supplies in abundance, in Introduction to Analysis
of the Inﬁnite we were able to gain some knowledge of more usual quan-
tities of this kind, namely, logarithms and circular arcs. In that work we
explained the nature of these quantities so clearly that they could be used
in calculation with almost the same facility as algebraic quantities. In this
chapter we will investigate the diﬀerentials of these quantities in order that
their character and properties can be even more clearly understood. With
this understanding, a portal will be opened up into integral calculus, which
is the principal source of these transcendental quantities.
179.
We begin with logarithmic quantities, that is, functions of x that,
besides algebraic expressions, also involve logarithms of x or any functions
of logarithms of x. Since algebraic quantities no longer are a problem, the
whole diﬃculty in ﬁnding diﬀerentials of these quantities lies in discovering
the diﬀerential of any logarithm itself. There are many kinds of logarithms,
which diﬀer from each other only by a constant multiple. Here we will
consider in particular the hyperbolic, or natural, logarithm, since the others
can easily be found from this one. If the natural logarithm of the function
p is signiﬁed by ln p, then the logarithm with a diﬀerent base of the same
function p will be m ln p where m is a number that relates logarithms with
this base to the hyperbolic logarithms. For this reason ln p will always
indicate the hyperbolic logarithm of p.

100
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
180. We are investigating the diﬀerential of the hyperbolic logarithm of x
and we let y = ln x, so that we have to deﬁne the value of dy. We substitute
x + dx for x so that y is transformed into yI = y + dy. From this we have
y + dy = ln (x + dx) ,
dy = ln (x + dx) −ln x = ln

1 + dx
x

.
But we have seen before1 that the hyperbolic logarithm of this kind of
expression 1 + z can be expressed in an inﬁnite series as follows:
ln (1 + z) = z −z2
2 + z3
3 −z4
4 + · · · .
When we substitute dx/x for z we obtain
dy = dx
x −dx2
2x2 + dx3
3x3 −· · · .
Since all of the terms of this series vanish in the presence of the ﬁrst term,
we have
d ln x = dy = dx
x .
It follows that the diﬀerential of any logarithm whatsoever that has the
ratio to the hyperbolic logarithm of n : 1, has the form n dx/x.
181.
Therefore, if ln p for any function p of x is given, by the same argu-
ment, we see that its diﬀerential will be dp/p. Hence, in order to ﬁnd the
diﬀerential of any logarithm we have the following rule:
For any quantity p whose logarithm is proposed, we take the diﬀerential
of that quantity p and divide by the quantity p itself in order to obtain the
desired diﬀerential of the logarithm.
This same rule follows from the form
p0 −10
0
,
to which we reduced the logarithm of p in the previous book.2 Let ω = 0,
and since ln p = (pω −1)/ω, we have
d ln p = d 1
ω pω = pω−1dp = dp
p ,
since ω = 0. It is to be noted, however, that dp/p is the diﬀerential of the
hyperbolic logarithm of p, so that if the common logarithm of p is desired,
this diﬀerential dp/p must be multiplied by the number 0.43429448 . . . .

By means of this rule the diﬀerential of the logarithm of any given
function of x whatsoever is easily found, which will be clear from the fol-
lowing examples.
I. If y = ln x, then
dy = dx
x .
II. If y = ln xn, we let xn = p, so that y = ln p and dy = dp/p. But
dp = nxn−1dx, so that
dy = n dx
x .
The same result can be found from the nature of logarithms; since
ln xn = n ln x, we have
d ln xn = nd ln x = n dx
x .

Although the given logarithm involves a complex number, the diﬀer-
ential is real.
183. If the logarithm of a product is given, then the logarithm is expressed
as a sum in the following manner. If y = ln pqrs is given, since y = ln p +
ln q + ln r + ln s, we have
dy = dp
p + dq
q + dr
r + ds
s .
This reduction also has a use if the logarithm of a quotient is to be diﬀer-
entiated. If
y = ln pq
rs,
since y = ln p + ln q −ln r −ln s, we have
dy = dp
p + dq
q −dr

I. If y = ln (a + x) (b + x) (c + x), since
y = ln (a + x) + ln (b + x) + ln (c + x) ,
the desired diﬀerential is
dy =

a + x +

184.
Since the ﬁrst diﬀerentials of logarithms, when divided by dx, are
algebraic quantities, the second diﬀerentials and those of higher orders can
easily be found with the rules of the previous chapter, provided that we
assume that the diﬀerential dx is constant. Hence, if we let y = ln x, then
dy = dx
x
and
dy
dx = 1
x,
d2y = −dx2
x2
and
d2y

etc. If p is an algebraic quantity and y = ln p, then although y is not an
algebraic quantity, nevertheless,
dy
dx,
d2y
dx2 ,
d3y
dx3 ,
etc., are algebraic functions of x.
185.
Now that we have discussed the diﬀerentiation of logarithms, those
functions that are a combination of logarithms and algebraic functions are
easily diﬀerentiated. Those functions that consist only of logarithms can
also be diﬀerentiated, as is clear from the following examples.
I. If y = (ln x)2, we let p = ln x, and since y = p2, we have dy = 2p dp.
but dp = dx/x, so that
dy = 2dx
x ln x.
II. In a similar way, if y = (ln x)n, then
dy = n dx
x
(ln x)n−1 ,
so that if y =
√
ln x, since n = 1
2, we have
dy =
dx
2x
√
ln x
.
III. If p is any function of x and y = (ln p)n, then
dy = n dp
p
(ln p)n−1 .
Hence, since the diﬀerential dp can be found by our previous work,
the diﬀerential of y itself is known.
IV. If y = (ln p) (ln q) with p and q being any functions of x, by the
product rule given before,
dy = dp
p ln q + dq
q ln p.
V. If y = x ln x, then by the same rule,
dy = dx ln x + x dx
x
= dx ln x + dx.

106
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
VI. If y = xm ln x −1
mxm, and we diﬀerentiate each part, we see that
d.xm ln x = mxm−1dx ln x + xm−1dx
and d. 1
mxm = xm−1dx, so that
dy = mxm−1dx ln x.
VII. If y = xm (ln x)n, then
dy = mxm−1dx (ln x)n + nxm−1dx (ln x)n−1 .
VIII. If logarithms of logarithms occur, so that y = ln ln x, we let p = ln x.
Then y = ln p and dy = dp
p ; but dp = dx
x , so that
dy =
dx
x ln x.
IX. If y = ln ln ln x and we let p = ln x, then y = ln ln p, and by the
preceding example
dy = dp
p dp.
But dp = dx/x, so that by substitution we have
dy =
dx
x ln x ln ln x.
186.
Now that we have discussed the diﬀerentiation of logarithms, we
move on to exponential quantities, that is, powers of the sort where the
exponent is a variable. The diﬀerentials of this kind of function of x can
be found by diﬀerentiating their logarithms, as follows. If we want the
diﬀerential of ax, we let y = ax and take the logarithm of each: ln y =
x ln a. When we take the diﬀerentials we have dy/y = dx ln a, so that dy =
y dx ln a. Since y = ax, we have dy = axdx ln a, which is the diﬀerential
of ax. In a similar way, if p is any function of x, the diﬀerential of ap is
apdp ln a.
187.
This diﬀerential could also be found immediately from the nature of
exponential quantities discussed in Introduction. Let ap be given where p
is any function of x. When we substitute x + dx for x we obtain p + dp.
Hence, if we let y = ap and x becomes x+dx, we have y +dy = ap+dp, and
so
dy = ap+dp −ap = ap 
adp −1

.

6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
107
We have shown3 that an exponential quantity az can be expressed by a
series as follows:
1 + z ln a + z2 (ln a)2
2
+ z3 (ln a)3
6
+ · · · .
It follows that
adp = 1 + dp ln a + dp2 (ln a)2
2
+ · · ·
and adp −1 = dp ln a, since the following terms vanish in the presence of
dp ln a. It follows that
dy = d.ap = apdp ln a.
Therefore, the diﬀerential of an exponential quantity ap is the product of
the exponential quantity itself, the diﬀerential of the exponent p, and the
logarithm of the constant quantity a that is raised to the variable exponent.
188.
If e is the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is equal to 1, so that
ln e = 1, then the diﬀerential of the quantity ex is equal to exdx. If dx is
taken to be constant, then the diﬀerential of this diﬀerential is equal to
exdx2, which is the second diﬀerential of ex. In a similar way the third
diﬀerential is equal to exdx3. It follows that if y = enx, then dy/dx = nenx
and d2y/dx2 = n2enx. Furthermore,
d3y
dx3 = n3enx,
d4y
dx4 = n4enx,
. . . .
Hence it is clear that the ﬁrst, second, and following diﬀerentials of enx
form a geometric progression, and it follows that the diﬀerential of order
m of y = enx, namely, dmy, equals nmenxdxm. Therefore,
dmy
y dxm
is the constant quantity nm.
189. If the quantity that is raised to a power is itself a variable, its diﬀer-
ential can be investigated in a similar way. Let p and q be any functions of
x, and we consider the exponential quantity y = pq. We take the logarithm
so that ln y = q ln p. When we diﬀerentiate these we have
dy
y = dq ln p + q dp
p ,
3Introduction, Book I, Chapter VII; see also note on page 1.

108
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
so that
dy = y dq ln p + yq dp
p
= pq dq ln p + qpq−1dp,
since y = pq. Hence this diﬀerential consists of two members, the ﬁrst
of which, pqdq ln p, would arise if in the proposed quantity pq the p were
constant and only the exponent q were variable; the other member would
arise if in the proposed quantity pq the exponent q were constant and only
the quantity p were variable. This diﬀerential could have been found by the
general rule given above in paragraph 170.
190.
The diﬀerential of this same expression pq can also be found from
the nature of an exponential quantity as follows. Let y = pq and let x be
replaced by x + dx so that y + dy = (p + dp)q+dq. This expression, when it
is expressed in the usual way by a series, gives
y + dy = pq+dq + (q + dq) pq+dq−1dp
+ (q + dq) (q + dq −1)
1 · 2
pq+dq−2dp2 + · · · ,
so that
dy = pq+dq −pq + (q + dq) pq+dq−1dp.
The following terms, which involve higher powers of dp vanish in the pres-
ence of (q + dq) pq+dq−1dp. But
pq+dq −pq = pq 
pdq −1



1 + dq ln p + dq2 (ln p)2
2
+ · · · −1

= pq dq ln p.
In the second term (q + dq) pq+dqpq+dq−1dp, if we write q instead of q + dq
we obtain qpq−1dp so that the diﬀerential is as was found before: dy =
pqdq ln p + qpq−1dp.
191. This same diﬀerential can more easily be investigated from the nature
of exponential quantities in the following way. Since we have taken the
number e for the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is equal to 1, we
let pq = eq ln p, because the logarithm of each is the same, q ln p. Hence
y = eq ln p. It follows, since now the quantity e that is raised to a power is
constant, we have
dy = eq ln p

dq ln p + q dp
p

,

6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
109
as we have shown before in the rule given in paragraph 187. When we
replace eq ln p with pq, we have
dy = pq dq ln p + pqq dp
p
= pq dq ln p + qpq−1dp.
If y = xx, we have dy = xxdx ln x. From this its higher diﬀerentials can
be deﬁned. We see that
d2y

etc.
192.
Among the diﬀerentials of this kind of function, which involve expo-
nential functions, the following examples should be especially noted. They
arise from the diﬀerentiation of exp, indeed,
d.exp = ex dp + exp dx = ex (dp + p dx) .
I. If y = exxn, then
dy = exnxn−1dx + exxn dx,
or,
dy = ex dx

nxn−1 + xn
.
II. If y = ex (x −1), then
dy = exx dx.
III. If y = ex 
x2 −2x + 2

, then
dy = exx2dx.
IV. If y = ex 
x3 −3x2 + 6x −6

, then
dy = exx3dx.
193.
If the exponents themselves are again exponential quantities, then
diﬀerentiation is accomplished according to the same rules. Thus, if we
want to diﬀerentiate eex, we let p = ex, so that
y = eex = ep;

110
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
Then dy = epdp, and since dp = exdx, it follows that if y = eex, then
dy = eexexdx.
If y = eeex
, then
dy = eeex
eexexdx.
However, if y = pqr, then we let qr = z, and dy = pzdz ln p + zpz−1dp, but
dz = qrdr ln q + rqr−1dq, so that
dy = pzqrdr ln p · ln q + pzrqr−1dq ln p + pzqrdp
p
.
It follows that if y = pqr, then
dy = pqrqr

dr ln p · ln q + r dq ln p

.
In this way, no matter how the exponential may occur, the diﬀerential can
be found.
194.
We proceed now to transcendental quantities. Previously, a consid-
eration of circular arcs has led us to a knowledge of these. Let an arc of
a circle whose radius is always equal to unity be given, and let the sine of
this arc be equal to x. We express this arc as arcsin x and we investigate
the diﬀerential of this arc, that is, the increment that it receives if the sine
of x is increased by its diﬀerential dx. We can accomplish this by the diﬀer-
entiation of logarithms, since in Introduction (loc. cit., paragraph 138) we
have shown that the expression arcsin x can be reduced to this logarithmic
expression:
1
√−1 ln

so that

√

111
195. This diﬀerential of a circular arc can also more easily be found with-
out the aid of logarithms. If y = arcsin x, then x is the sine of the arc y,
that is, x = sin y. When we substitute x + dx for x, y becomes y + dy, so
that x + dx = sin (y + dy). Since
sin (a + b) = sin a · cos b + cos a · sin b,
we have
sin (y + dy) = sin y · cos dy + cos y · sin dy.
As dy vanishes the arc becomes equal to its sine, and its cosine becomes
equal to 1. For this reason sin (y + dy) = sin y + dy cos y, so that x + dx =
sin y + dy cos y. Since sin y = x, we have cos y =
√
1 −x2, and when these
values are substituted, we have dx = dy
√
1 −x2, from which we obtain
dy =
dx
√
1 −x2 .
The arc of a given sine has a diﬀerential equal to the diﬀerential of the sine
divided by the cosine.
196.
Suppose p is any function of x and that y is the arc whose sine is p,
that is, y = arcsin p. Since the diﬀerential of this arc is dy = dp/

1 −p2,
where

1 −p2 expresses the cosine of that same arc, we can ﬁnd the dif-
ferential of an arc whose cosine is given. If y = arccos x, then the sine
of this arc is equal to
√
1 −x2, so that y = arcsin
√
1 −x2. When we let
p =
√
1 −x2, it follows that dp = −dx/
√
1 −x2 and

1 −p2 = x, so that
dy =
−dx
√
1 −x2 .
The diﬀerential of the arc of a given cosine is equal to the negative of the
diﬀerential of the cosine divided by the sine of that same arc.
This result can also be shown in the following way. If y = arccos x, we
let z = arcsin x, so that dz = dx/
√
1 −x2. But the sum of the two arcs
y and z is equal to the constant 90 degrees, that is y + z is constant, so
that dy + dz = 0, or dy = −dz. Hence we have the same result as before,
dy = −dx/
√
1 −x2.
197.
If an arc whose tangent is given is to be diﬀerentiated, we begin
with y = arctan x. But then the sine is equal to x/
√
1 + x2 and the cosine
is equal to 1/
√
1 + x2. We let p = x/
√
1 + x2, so that

1 −p2 =
1
√
1 + x2 ,
and so y = arcsin p. Hence, by a rule already given dy = dp/

1 −p2. Since
p = x/
√
1 + x2, we have
dp =
dx
(1 + x2)3/2 ,

112
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
and after substitution we obtain
dy =
dx
1 + x2 .
The diﬀerential of the arc whose tangent is given is equal to the diﬀerential
of the tangent divided by the square of the secant. We note that
√
1 + x2 is
the secant if x is the tangent.
198.
In a similar way, suppose that the cotangent of an arc is given, so
that y is equal to the arccotangent of x. Since the tangent of that same arc
is 1/x, we let p = 1/x, so that y = tan p. Since
dy =
dp
1 + p2
and
dp = −dx
x2 ,
we make the substitutions to obtain
dy =
−dx
1 + x2 ,
that is, the diﬀerential of the arc of a cotangent is the negative of the
diﬀerential of the cotangent divided by the square of the cosecant.
If y is equal to the arcsecant of x, since
y = arccos 1
x,
we have
dy =
dx
x2
1 −1/x2 =

.
Also, if y is equal to the arccosecant of x, then
y = arcsin 1
x
and
dy =
−dx
x
√
x2 −1
.
Frequently, the versed sine4 occurs. If y is equal to the versed sine of x,
since y = cos (1 −x), the sine of this arc is equal to
√
2x −x2, so that
dy =
dx
√
2x −x2 .
4The versed sine of α is equal to 1 −cos α.

Although the arc whose sine or cosine or tangent or cotangent or
secant or cosecant or ﬁnally versed sine is given is a transcendental quantity,
nevertheless its diﬀerential when divided by dx is an algebraic quantity. It
follows that its second diﬀerential, its third, fourth, and so forth, when
divided by the appropriate power of dx, are also algebraic. In order that
this diﬀerentiation might better be seen, we adjoin some examples.
I. If y = arcsin 2x
√
1 −x2, we let p = 2x
√
1 −x2, so that y = arcsin p
and dy = dp/

1 −p2. But then
dp = 2dx

1 −x2 −
2x2dx
√
1 −x2 = 2dx

1 −2x2
√
1 −x2
and

1 −p2 = 1 −2x2, so when these values are substituted we have
dy =
2dx
√
1 −x2 .
From this it is clear that 2x
√
1 −x2 is the sine of twice the arc where
x is the sine of the original arc. Hence if y = 2 arcsin x, then dy =
2dx/
√
1 −x2.
II. If
y = arcsin 1 −x2
1 + x2 ,
we let
p = 1 −x2
1 + x2 ,
so that
dp =
−4x dx
(1 + x2)2
and

1 −p2 =
2x
1 + x2 .
Since
dy =
dp

1 −p2 ,
we have
dy = −2dx
1 + x2 .
III. If y = arcsin

(1 −x)/2, we let p =

(1 −x)/2, so that

1 −p2 =

1 + x
2
and
dp =
−dx
4
	
1−x

.
It follows that
dy =
dp

1 −p2 =
−dx
2
√
1 −x2 .

IV. If
y = arctan
2x
1 −x2 ,
we let
p =
2x
1 −x2 ,
so that
1 + p2 =

1 + x22
(1 −x2)2
and
dp = 2dx

1 + x2
(1 −x2)2
.
Hence, since dy = dp/

1 + p2
, we have by the rule for tangents
(paragraph 197)
dy =
2dx
1 + x2 .
V. If
y = arctan
√
1 + x2 −1
x
,
we let
p =
√
1 + x2 −1
x
,
so that
p2 = 2 + x2 −2
√
1 + x2
x2
and
1 + p2 = 2 + 2x2 −2
√
1 + x2
x2
= 2
√

But
dp =

x2√
1 + x2 x2 + dx
x2 = dx
√
1 + x2 −1

x2√
1 + x2
.
Hence, since dy = dp/

1 + p2
, we have
dy =
dx
2 (1 + x2).
From this we see that
arctan
√
1 + x2 −1
x
= 1
2 arctan x.

VI. If y = earcsin x, this formula can also be diﬀerentiated by the preceding
methods. Indeed, we have
dy = earcsin x
dx
√
1 −x2 .
In this way all functions of x involving not only logarithms and exponen-
tials, but also even circular arcs, can be diﬀerentiated.
200. Since the diﬀerentials of arcs when divided by dx are algebraic quan-
tities, their second, and higher, diﬀerentials can be found, as we have
shown, by diﬀerentiation of algebraic quantities. Let y = arcsin x. Since
dy = dx/
√
1 −x2, we have
dy
dx =
1
√
1 −x2 ,
whose diﬀerential gives the value of d2y/dx2, provided that we keep dx
constant. Hence the diﬀerentials of this y of any order are of this kind.
If y = arcsin x, then
dy
dx =
1
√
1 −x2 ,
and when we keep dx constant,
d2y
dx2 =

(1 −x2)3/2 ,

201.
There remain some quantities that arise as inverses of these func-
tions, namely the sines and tangents of given arcs, and we ought to show
how these are diﬀerentiated. Let x be a circular arc and let sin x denote its
sine, whose diﬀerential we are to investigate. We let y = sin x and replace
x by x + dx so that y becomes y + dy. Then y + dy = sin (x + dx) and
dy = sin (x + dx) −sin x.
But
sin (x + dx) = sin x · cos dx + cos x · sin dx,
and since, as we have shown in Introduction,
sin z = z
1 −
z3
1 · 2 · 3 +
z5
1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5 −· · · ,
cos z = 1 −z2
1 · 2 +
z4
1 · 2 · 3 · 4 −· · · ,
when we exclude the vanishing terms, we have cos dx = 1 and sin dx = dx,
so that
sin (x + dx) = sin x + dx cos x.
Hence, when we let y = sin x, we have
dy = dx cos x.
Therefore, the diﬀerential of the sine of any arc is equal to the product of
the diﬀerential of the arc and the cosine of the arc.

6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
117
If p is any function of x, then in a similar way we have
d. sin p = dp cos p.
202. Similarly, if we are given cos x, that is, the cosine of the arc x, and we
are to investigate its diﬀerential, we let y = cos x and replace x by x + dx
so that y + dy = cos (x + dx). Since
cos (x + dx) = cos x · cos dx −sin x · sin dx,
and since, as we have just seen, cos dx = 1 and sin dx = dx, we have
y + dy = cos x −dx sin x,
so that
dy = −dx sin x.
Hence, the diﬀerential of the cosine of any arc is equal to the negative of
the product of the diﬀerential of the arc and the sine of the same arc.
Hence, if p is any function of x, then
d. cos p = −dp sin p.
These diﬀerentiations can also be derived from previous results as follows.
If y = sin p, then p = arcsin y and
dp =
dy

1 −y2 .
Since y = sin p, cos p =

1 −y2, and we substitute this value to obtain
dp = dy/cos p, and so
dy = dp cos p
as before. In like manner, if y = cos p, then

1 −y2 = sin p and p =
arccos y. Hence
dp =
−dy

1 −y2 = −dy
sin p,
so that we have as before
dy = −dp sin p.
203.
If y = tan x, then
dy = tan (x + dx) −tan x;

118
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
since
tan (x + dx) =
tan x + tan dx
1 −tan x · tan dx,
when the tangent is subtracted from this expression there remains
dy = tan dx (1 + tan x · tan x)
1 −tan x · tan dx
.
However, when the arc dx vanishes, the tangent is equal to the arc itself,
so that tan dx = dx, and the denominator 1 −dx tan x reduces to unity.
Hence
dy = dx

1 + tan2 x

.
Since
1 + tan2 x = sec2 x =
1
cos2 x,
we have
dy = dx sec2 x =
dx
cos2 x.
We could also obtain this diﬀerential from the diﬀerentials of the sine and
cosine. Since tan x = sin x/cos x, we have (paragraph 164)
dy = dx cos x · cos x + dx sin x · sin x
cos2 x
=
dx
cos2 x
since sin2 x + cos2 x = 1.
204. This diﬀerential can also be found in a diﬀerent way. Since y = tan x,
we have x = arctan y, and by the rule given above,
dx =
dy
1 + y2 .
Since y = tan x,

1 + y2 = sec x =
1
cos x,
so that dx = dy cos2 x and
dy =
dx
cos2 x
as before. The diﬀerential of the tangent of any arc is equal to the diﬀer-
ential of the arc divided by the square of the cosine of the same arc.

6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
119
In a similar way if we let y = cot x, then x is equal to the arccotangent
of y and
dx =
−dy
1 + y2 .
But

1 + y2 = csc x =
1
sin x,
so that dx = −dy sin2 x and
dy = −dx
sin2 x.
The diﬀerential of the cotangent of any arc is equal to the negative of the
diﬀerential of the arc divided by the square of the sine of the same arc.
Or since
cot x = cos x
sin x ,
we have from the quotient rule
dy = −dx sin2 x −dx cos2 x
sin2 x
= −dx
sin2 x
as we have already seen.
205.
If the secant of an arc is given, so that y = sec x, since y = 1/cos x,
we have
dy = dx sin x
cos2x
= dx tan x sec x.
In a similar way, if y = csc x, we have
dy = −dx cos x
sin2x
= −dx cot x csc x,
and it is not necessary to consider rules for special cases. If the versed sine
is given and y is equal to the versed sine of x, since y = 1 −cos x, we have
dy = dx sin x. In all of the cases in which some straight line is related to
a given arc, since it can always be expressed through a sine or a cosine, it
can always be diﬀerentiated without diﬃculty. This is true not only of the
ﬁrst diﬀerentials, but also of the second and succeeding diﬀerentials by the
given rules. We let y = sin x, z = cos x, and we keep dx constant. Then we

120
6. On the Diﬀerentiation of Transcendental Functions
have as follows:
y = sin x,
z = cos x,
dy = dx cos x,
dz = −dx sin x,
d2y = −dx2 sin x,
d2z = −dx2 cos x,
d3y = −dx3 cos x,
d3z = dx3 sin x,
d4y = −dx4 sin x,
d4z = dx4 cos x,
. . . .
206.
In a similar way we can ﬁnd the diﬀerentials of all orders of the
tangent of the arc x. Let y = tan x = sin x/cos x and keep dx constant.
Then
y = sin x
cos x,
dy
dx =
1

207.
Any function whatsoever in which the sine or cosine of an arc is
involved can be diﬀerentiated by these rules. This can be seen from the
following examples.
I. If y = 2 sin x cos x = sin 2x, then
dy = 2dx cos2 x −2dx sin2 x = 2dx cos 2x.
II. If y =

Since

dy = 1

which follows immediately from the form y = sin 1

III. If y = cos ln 1
x, we let p = ln 1
x so that y = cos p. Hence
dy = −dp sin p.
But since p = ln 1 −ln x, we have dp = −dx/x, and so

On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions
of Two or More Variables
208.
If two or more variable quantities x, y, z are independent of each
other, it can happen that while one of the variables increases or decreases,
the other variables remain constant. Since we have supposed that there is
no connection between the variables, a change in one does not aﬀect the
others. Neither do the diﬀerentials of the quantities y and z depend on the
diﬀerential of x, with the result that when x is increased by its diﬀerential
dx, the quantities y and z can either remain the same, or they can change in
any desired way. Hence, if the diﬀerential of x is dx, the diﬀerentials of the
remaining quantities, dy and dz, remain indeterminate and by our arbitrary
choice will be presumed to be either practically nothing or inﬁnitely small
when compared to dx.
209. However, frequently the letters y and z are wont to signify functions
of x that are either unknown or whose relationship to x is not considered.
In this case the diﬀerentials dy and dz do have a certain relationship to dx.
Whether or not y and z depend on x, the method of diﬀerentiation that we
now consider is the same. We look for the diﬀerential of a function that is
formed in any way from the several variables x, y, and z that the function
receives when each variable x, y, z increases by its respective diﬀerential
dx, dy, or dz. In order to ﬁnd this for the given function, for each of the
variables x, y, and z we write x + dx, y + dy, and z + dz, and from this
expression we subtract the given function. The remainder is the desired
diﬀerential. This should be clear from the nature of diﬀerentials.

124
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
210.
Let X be a function of x, and let its diﬀerential, or increase, be
equal to P dx, when x increases by dx. Then let Y be a function of y and
let its diﬀerential be equal to Q dy, which is the augmentation Y receives
when y is increased to y + dy. Finally, let Z be a function or z, and let its
diﬀerential be equal to R dz. These diﬀerentials P dx, Q dy, and R dz can
be found from the nature of the functions X, Y , and Z by means of the
rules we have given above. Suppose the given function is X +Y +Z, which
is a function of the three variables x, y, and z, and its diﬀerential is equal
to P dx + Q dy + R dz. Whether these three diﬀerentials are homogeneous
or not need not concern us. Terms that contain powers of dx will vanish in
the presence of P dx, as if the other members Q dy and R dz were absent.
For a similar reason we neglect terms in the diﬀerentiation of the functions
Y and Z.
211.
We keep the same description of X, Y , and Z and let the given
function be XY Z, which is a function of x, y, and z. We investigate the
diﬀerential of this function. If we replace x by x+dx, y by y +dy, and z by
z + dz, then X becomes X + P dx, Y becomes Y + Q dy, and Z becomes
Z + R dz, so that the given function XY Z becomes
(X + P dx) (Y + Q dy) (Z + R dz)
= XY Z + Y ZP dx + XZQ dy + XY R dz
+ ZPQ dx dy + Y PR dx dz + XQR dy dz + PQR dx dy dz.
Since dx, dy, and dz are inﬁnitely small, whether they are mutually homo-
geneous or not, the last term will vanish in the presence of any one of the
preceding terms. Then the term ZPQ dx dy will vanish in the presence of ei-
ther Y ZP dx or XZQ dy. For the same reason Y PR dx dz and XQR dy dz
will vanish. When we subtract the given function, the remainder is the
diﬀerential
Y ZP dx + XZQ dy + XY R dz.
212.
These examples of functions of three variables x, y, and z, to which
we could, if desired, add more, should be suﬃcient to show that for any
proposed function of three variables x, y, and z, howsoever these variables
may be combined, the diﬀerential will always have this same form p dx +
q dy +r dz. These functions p, q and r will be individual functions of either
all three variables x, y, and z or of two variables, or even of only one,
depending of how the given function is formed from the three variables and
constants. In a similar way, if the given function depends on four or more
variables, say x, y, z, and v, then its diﬀerential will have the form
p dx + q dy + r dz + s dv.

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
125
213.
Let us consider ﬁrst a function of only two variables x and y, which
we will call V . Then its diﬀerential will have the form
dV = p dx + q dy.
If we let the quantity y remain constant, then dy = 0, so that the diﬀerential
of the function V will be p dx. If, on the other hand, we let x remain
constant, then dx = 0 and only y remains variable, so that the diﬀerential
of V is equal to q dy. The result is that the rule for diﬀerentiating a function
V of two variables x and y is as follows:
Let only the ﬁrst quantity x remain variable, while the second quantity y
is treated as a constant. We take the diﬀerential of V , which will be equal
to p dx. Then we let only the quantity y remain variable, while the other,
x, is kept as constant and the diﬀerential is found, which will be equal to
q dy. From these results, when we let both x and y be variable we have
dV = p dx + q dy.
214.
In a similar way, when the function V is of three variables x, y, and
z, the diﬀerential of this function has the form
dV = p dx + q dy + r dz.
It is clear that if only the quantity x is kept variable and the remaining y
and z are kept constant, since dy = 0 and dz = 0, the diﬀerential of V will
be equal to p dx. In a like manner we ﬁnd the diﬀerential of V to be equal
to q dy when x and z are constant while only y is variable. If x and y are
treated as constants and only z is variable, we see that the diﬀerential of V
is equal to r dz. Hence, in order to ﬁnd the diﬀerential of a function of three
or more variables, we consider individually each variable as if it alone were
variable and then take the diﬀerential, considering the other quantities as
constant. Then we take the sum of each of these diﬀerentials found with
each individual quantity taken as variable. This sum will be the required
diﬀerential of the given function.
215. In this rule, which we have found for the diﬀerentiation of a function
of however many variables, we have a demonstration of the general rule
given above (paragraph 170) by means of which any function of one variable
can be diﬀerentiated. If for each term of the function discussed in that
place the variable is considered to be a diﬀerent letter and then each term
is successively diﬀerentiated in the way we have just prescribed, as if only
that were variable, we then collect into one sum each of the diﬀerentials
obtained in this way. This sum will be the desired diﬀerential after each
of the individual letters has its value restored. Hence this rule has wide
application to functions of several variables, no matter how they may be
composed. Thus its use in all of diﬀerential calculus is quite wide.

126
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
216.
Now that we have found this general rule, by means of which func-
tions of howsoever many variables can be diﬀerentiated, it will be pleasant
to show its use in several examples.

We have seen that if V is a function of two variables x and y, its
diﬀerential will have the form dV = P dx + Q dy, in which P and Q are
functions that depend on V and are determined by it. It follows that these
two quantities P and Q in some certain way depend on each other, since
each depends on the function V . Whatever this connection between the
ﬁnite quantities P and Q may be, which we will have to investigate, it is
clear that not all diﬀerential formulas with the form P dx+Q dy, in which P
and Q are arbitrarily chosen, can be the diﬀerential of some ﬁnite function
V of x and y. Unless this relationship between the functions P and Q is
present, which the nature of diﬀerentiation requires, a diﬀerential of the
type P dx + Q dy clearly cannot arise from diﬀerentiation, and in turn will
have no integral.
218.
Therefore, in integration it is of great interest to know this rela-
tionship between the quantities P and Q in order that we may distinguish
between those that really arose from the diﬀerentiation of some ﬁnite func-
tion and those that were formed arbitrarily and have no integral. Although
we are not going to take up the business of integration here, still this is
a convenient time to investigate this relationship by looking more deeply
into the nature of real diﬀerentials. Not only is this knowledge extremely
necessary for integral calculus, for which we are preparing the way, but
also it will cast signiﬁcant light on diﬀerential calculus itself. First, then,
it is clear that if V is a function of two variables x and y, then both the
diﬀerentials dx and dy must be present in the diﬀerential P dx + Q dy. It

128
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
follows that it is not possible for P to be equal to zero, nor for Q to be
equal to zero. Hence, if P is a function of x and y, the formula P dx cannot
be the diﬀerential of some ﬁnite quantity, that is, there is no ﬁnite quantity
whose diﬀerential is P dx.
219.
Thus there is no ﬁnite quantity V , whether algebraic or transcen-
dental, whose diﬀerential is yx dx, provided that y is a variable quantity
which is independent of x. If we should suppose that there did exist such a
ﬁnite quantity V , since y is part of its diﬀerential, it would necessarily be
the case that y would also be in the quantity V . But if V contained y, due
to the variability of y, necessarily dy would have to be in the diﬀerential
of V . However, since it is not present, it is not possible that yx dx could
arise from the diﬀerentiation of some ﬁnite quantity. It is equally clear that
the formula P dx + Q dy, if Q is equal to zero and P contains y, cannot
be a real diﬀerential. At the same time we understand that the quantity Q
cannot be chosen arbitrarily, but that it depends on P.
220.
In order to investigate this relationship between P and Q in the
diﬀerential dV = P dx + Q dy, we ﬁrst suppose that V is a function of
zero dimension in x and y. We proceed from particular cases to a general
relation. Suppose that we let y = tx. Then the quantity x vanishes from the
function V , and we have a function of t alone, which we call T, and whose
diﬀerential is Θ dt, where Θ is a function of t. We also substitute everywhere
y = tx and dy = t dx + x dt. From this we obtain P dx + Qt dx + Qx dt.
Since dx is really not contained in this, we necessarily have P + Qt = 0, so
that
Q = −P
t
= −Px
y
and
Px + Qy = 0.
Hence in this case we have found the relation between P and Q. Further-
more, it is necessary that Θ = Qx so that Qx is equal to a function of t,
that is, a function of zero dimension in x and y. Since Q = Θ/x, we have
P = −Θy/x2, and both Px and Qy are functions of zero dimension in x
and y.
221.
If a function V is a function of zero dimension in x and y, and it
is diﬀerentiated, then its diﬀerential P dx + Q dy will always be such that
Px + Qy = 0. That is, if in the diﬀerential instead of the diﬀerentials dx
and dy we write x and y, the result will be equal to zero, as will appear
from the following examples.
I. Let V = x
y . Then
dV = y dx −x dy
y2
,

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
129
and when x replaces dx and y replaces dy, we have
yx −xy
y2
= 0.
II. Let V =
x

x2 −y2 . Then
dV = −y2dx −yx dy
(x2 −y2)3/2 ,
so that
−y2x + y2x
(x2 −y2)3/2 = 0.
III. Let V = y +

x2 + y2
−y +

x2 + y2 , which is a function of zero dimension in x
and y. Then
dV =
2x2dy −2xy dx

x2 + y2 −y
2 
x2 + y2
,
and when x and y are substituted for dx and dy, the result is zero.
IV. Let V = ln
x + y
x −y

. Then
dV = 2x dy −2y dx
x2 −y2
,
and
2xy −2yx
x2 −y2
= 0.
V. Let V = arcsin
√x −y
√x + y

. Then
dV =
y dx −x dy
(x + y)
√
2y (x −y),
and this formula enjoys the same property.
222. Now let us consider some other homogeneous functions and let V be
an n-dimensional function of x and y. Hence if we let y = tx, then V takes
the form Txn, where T is a function of t. We let dT = Θ dt so that
dV = xnΘ dt + nTxn−1dx

130
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
If we let dV = P dx + Q dy, since dy = t dx + x dt, we have
dV = P dx + Qt dx + Qx dt.
Since the two forms should be equal, we have
P + Qt = nTxn−1 = nV
x
because V = Txn. Since t = y/x we have
Px + Qy = nV,
and this equation thus deﬁnes the relation between P and Q. Hence if one
is known, the other is easily discovered. Since Qx = xnΘ, it follows that
Qx, as well as Qy and Px, is an n-dimensional function of x and y.
223.
Hence, if in the diﬀerential of any homogeneous function in x and y
we substitute x and y for dx and dy, respectively, the result will be equal to
the original function whose diﬀerential is given multiplied by the dimension.
I. If V =

x2 + y2, then n = 1, and since
dV = x dx + y dy

x2 + y2 ,
we have
x2 + y2

x2 + y2 = V =

x2 + y2.
II. If V = y3 + x3
y −x , then n = 2 and
dV = 2y3dy −3y2x dy + 3yx2dx −2x3dx + y3dx −x3dy
(y −x)2
.
When we substitute x for dx and y for dy, we have
2y4 −2y3x + 2yx3 −2x4
(y −x)2
= 2y3 + 2x3
y −x
= 2V.
III. If V =
1
(y2 + y2)2 , then n = −4 and
dV = −4y dy + 4x dx
(y2 + x2)3
.
When we substitute x for dx and y for dy, we have
−4y2 + 4x2
(x2 + y2)3 = −4V.

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables

IV. If V = x2 ln
x + y
y −x

, then n = 2 and
dV = 2x dx ln
y + x
y −x

+ 2x2 (y dx −x dy)
y2 −x2
.
When we make the required substitutions, there arises
2x2 ln
y + x
y −x

= 2V.
224.
A similar property can be observed if V is a homogeneous function
in more than two variables. If V is a function of the quantities x, y, and
z, which together have a dimension of n, then its diﬀerential has the form
P dx+Q dy+R dz. When we let y = tx and z = sx, so that dy = t dx+x dt
and dz = s dx + x ds, then furthermore, the function V takes the form
Uxn, where U is a function of the two variables t and s. Hence, if we let
dU = p dt + q ds, then
dV = xnpdt + xnq ds + nUxn−1dx.
The previous form gives
dV = P dx + Qt dx + Qx dt + Rs dx + Rx ds.
When these two forms are compared, we have
P + Qt + Rs = nUxn−1 = nV
x ,
from which we obtain
Px + Qy + Rz = nV.
This same property extends to functions of howsoever many variables.
225.
If the given function is homogeneous in howsoever many variables
x, y, z, v, . . . , its diﬀerential will always have the property that, if for the dif-
ferentials dx, dy, dz, dv, . . . we substitute the ﬁnite quantities x, y, z, v, . . . ,
then the result is the given function multiplied by the dimension. This rule
applies likewise if V is a homogeneous function of the single variable x. In
this case V is a power of x, for example V = axn, which is a homogeneous
function of dimension n. Indeed, there is no other function of x in which
x has n dimensions besides the power xn. Since dV = naxn−1dx, when we
substitute x for dx, we obtain naxn, which is nV . This remarkable property
of homogeneous functions deserves to be very carefully noted, since it will
have extremely useful consequences in integral calculus.

132
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
226. Now, in order to inquire into the general relationship between P and
Q, which constitute the diﬀerential P dx + Q dy of any function V of two
variables x and y, we need to pay attention to what follows. If V is any
function whatsoever of x and y, and we substitute x + dx for x, then V is
transformed into R. If y + dy is substituted for y, then V is transformed
into S. If simultaneously x+dx and y+dy are substituted for x and y, then
V is changed into V I. Since R comes from V when x + dx is substituted
for x, it is clear that if furthermore y + dy is substituted in R, the result is
V I. It comes to the same thing as substituting x + dx for x and y + dy for
y immediately. In a similar way, if x + dx is substituted for x in S, since
S has already arisen from V by substituting y + dy for y, once again we
obtain V I, as may be seen more clearly from the following table.
The quantity
becomes

227. If we diﬀerentiate V as if x were the only variable and y is treated as a
constant, since we substitute x+dx for x, the function V becomes R, whose
diﬀerential will be equal to R−V . From the form dV = P dx+Q dy it follows
that the same diﬀerential will be equal to P dx, so that R−V = P dx. If we
substitute y + dy for y and treat x as a constant, since R becomes V I and
V becomes S; the quantity R −V becomes V I −S. Then the diﬀerential of
R −V = P dx, which arises if only y is considered variable, will be equal
to
V I −R −S + V.
In a similar way, when we substitute y+dy for y, V becomes S, so that S−V
is the diﬀerential of V if we let only y be variable, so that Q −V = Q dy.
Now when we substitute x + dx for x, S becomes V I and V becomes R, so
that the quantity S−V becomes V I−R and the diﬀerential of S−V = Q dy,
which arises when only x is variable, is equal to
V I −R −S + V,
which is equal to the diﬀerential we found previously.

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
133
228. From this equality we deduce the following conclusion. If any function
V of two variables x and y has a diﬀerential dV = P dx + Q dy, then the
diﬀerential of P dx, which comes from letting only y be variable while x
is held constant, is equal to the diﬀerential of Q dy, which comes from
letting only x be variable while y is held constant. For instance, if only
y is variable, then dP = Z dy and the diﬀerential of P dx, taken in the
prescribed way, will be equal to Z dx dy. Now, if we let only x be variable,
then also dQ = Z dx. Thus the diﬀerential of Q dy, taken in the prescribed
way, will be Z dx dy. In this way we understand the relationship between P
and Q. In short, the diﬀerential of P dx when x is constant must be equal
to the diﬀerential of Q dy when y is constant.
229.
This remarkable property will become clearer if we illustrate it with
a few examples.
I. Let V = yx. Then
dV = y dx + x dy,
so that P = y and Q = x. When we keep x constant,
d.P dx = dx dy,
and when y is kept constant,
d.Q dy = dx dy,
so that the two diﬀerentials are equal.
II. Let V =

x2 −2xy. Then
dV = x dx + y dx + x dy

x2 + 2xy
,
so that
P =
x + y

x2 + 2xy
and
Q =
x

x2 + 2xy
,
so that when x is kept constant,
d.P dx =
xy dx dy
(x2 + 2xy)3/2 ,
and when y is kept constant,
d.Q =
xy dx dy
(x2 + 2xy)3/2 .

134
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
III. Let V = x sin y + y sin x, so that
dV = dx sin y + x dy cos y + dy sin x + y dx cos x.
Hence P dx = dx sin y + y dx cos x and Q dy = dy sin x + x dy cos y.
When we keep x constant, we have
d.P dx = dx dy cos y + dx dy cos x,
and when y is kept constant, we have
d.Q dy = dx dy cos y + dx dy cos x.
IV. Let V = xy. Then
dV = xy dy ln x + yxy−1dx,
so that P dx = yxy−1dx and Q dy = xydy ln x. Hence when we keep
x constant we have
d.P dx = xy−1dx dy + yxy−1dx dy ln x,
and when y is kept constant, we have
d.Q dy = yxy−1dx dy ln x + xy−1dx dy.
230. This property can also be stated in another way, so that this remark-
able characteristic of all functions of two variables can be understood. If
any function V of two variables x and y is diﬀerentiated with only x vari-
able, and this diﬀerential is again diﬀerentiated with only y variable, then
after this double diﬀerentiation, the same result is obtained when the order
of diﬀerentiation is reversed by ﬁrst diﬀerentiating V with only y variable
and then diﬀerentiating this diﬀerential with only x variable. Both of these
cases give the same expression of the form z dx dy. The reason for this
identity clearly follows from the previous property; for if V is diﬀerentiated
with only x variable, we have P dx, and if V is diﬀerentiated with only y
variable, we have Q dy. The diﬀerentials of these, in the way already indi-
cated, are equal, as we have demonstrated. For the rest, this characteristic
follows immediately from the argument given in paragraph 227.
231.
The relationship between P and Q, if P dx + Q dy is the diﬀerential
of the function V , can also be indicated in the following way. Since P and Q
are functions of x and y, they can both be diﬀerentiated with both x and y
variable. If dV = P dx + Q dy, then dP = p dx + r dy and dQ = q dx + s dy.
Therefore, when x is constant, dP = r dy and d.P dx = r dx dy. Then when
y is constant dQ = q dx and d.Q dy = q dx dy. Since these two diﬀerentials
r dx dy and q dx dy are equal to each other, it follows that
q = r.

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
135
Therefore, the functions P and Q are related in such a way that if both of
them are diﬀerentiated as we have done, the quantities q and r are equal to
each other. For the sake of brevity, at least in this chapter, the quantities r
and q will conveniently be symbolized by ∂P/∂y, in that P is diﬀerentiated
with only y variable, which is indicated by ∂y in the denominator. In this
way we obtain the ﬁnite quantity r. In like manner ∂Q/∂x will symbolize
the ﬁnite quantity q, since by this is indicated that the function Q is dif-
ferentiated with only x variable, so we ought to divide the diﬀerential by
∂x.
232.
We will use this method of symbolizing, although there is some
danger of ambiguity therein. We avoid this with the use of the partial
symbol, with the result that the complications in describing the conditions
of diﬀerentiation are avoided. Thus we can brieﬂy express the relationship
between P and Q by stating
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x .
In fractions of this kind, beyond the usual signiﬁcance is which the denom-
inator indicates the divisor, here the diﬀerential of the numerator is to be
taken with only that quantity variable which is indicted by the diﬀerential
in the denominator. In this way by the division of diﬀerentials these frac-
tions ∂P/∂y and ∂Q/∂x exist from calculus and indicate ﬁnite quantities,
which in this case are equal to each other. Once this method is agreed upon,
the quantities p and s can be denoted by p = ∂P/∂x and s = ∂Q/∂y if, as
we have noted, the diﬀerentiation of the numerator by the denominator is
properly restricted.
233. There is a wonderful agreement between this property and that prop-
erty of homogeneous functions which we previously have shown. Let V be a
homogeneous function in x and y of dimension n. We let dV = P dx+Q dy,
and we have shown that nV = Px + Qy. Hence
Q = nV
y
−Px
y .
We let dP = p dx + r dy, so that
∂P
∂y = r,
which is thus shown to be equal to ∂Q/∂x. Let Q be diﬀerentiated with
only x variable, and under the present hypothesis we have
dQ = nP dx
y
−P dx
y
−xp dx
y
,

136
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
so that
∂Q
∂x = (n −1) P
y
−px
y ,
and we must have
(n −1) P
y
−px
y = r,
or
(n −1) P = px + ry.
This equality becomes clear when we note that P is a homogeneous function
in x and y of dimension n −1, so that its diﬀerential dP = p dx + r dy, due
to the property of homogeneous functions, should be such that (n −1) P =
px + ry.
234.
This property, that
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x ,
which we have shown to be common to all functions of two variables x and
y, can also reveal to us the nature of functions of three or more variables.
Let V be any function of three variables x, y, and z, and let
dV = P dx + Q dy + R dz.
If in this diﬀerentiation z is treated as a constant, then dV = P dx+Q dy. In
this case by what has gone before it should be true that ∂P/∂y = ∂Q/∂x.
Then if y is supposed to be constant, we have dV = P dx + R dz, so that
∂P/∂z = ∂R/∂x. Finally with x constant we see that ∂Q/∂z = ∂R/∂y.
Therefore, in the diﬀerential P dx + Q dy + R dz of the function V , the
quantities P, Q, and R are related to each other in such a way that
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x ,
∂P
∂z = ∂R
∂x ,
∂Q
∂z = ∂R
∂y .
235.
It follows that this property of functions that involve three or more
variables is analogous to that which we have shown above (paragraph 230)
for functions of two variables. If V is any function of three variables x,
y, and z, and this is diﬀerentiated three times in such a way that in the
ﬁrst diﬀerentiation the ﬁrst variable, that is, x, is the only variable, in the
second diﬀerentiation only y is variable, and in the third only z is variable,
then we obtain an expression of the form Z dx dy dz. This same expression
is obtained no matter in which order the quantities x, y, and z are taken.
There are six diﬀerent ways of taking the threefold derivative to obtain the

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
137
same expression, since there are six ways of ordering x, y, and z. No matter
what order is chosen, if the function V is diﬀerentiated with only the ﬁrst
variable, and that is then diﬀerentiated with only the second variable, and
this then diﬀerentiated with only the third variable, the same expression is
obtained when the order is changed.
236.
In order that the reason for this property may be seen more clearly,
we let
dV = P dx + Q dy + R dz.
Then we diﬀerentiate each of the quantities P, Q, and R, with their diﬀer-
entials of the form we have already seen:
dP = p dx + s dy + t dz,
dQ = s dx + q dy + u dz,
dR = t dx + u dy + r dz.
Now if we diﬀerentiate V with only x variable, we have P dx. This diﬀer-
ential is now diﬀerentiated with only y variable to obtain s dx dy. If this
is diﬀerentiated with only z variable, and after this is divided by dx dy dz,
we have ∂s/∂z. Now we reorder the variables as y, x, z, and the ﬁrst dif-
ferentiation gives Q dy, the second s dx dy and the third (when divided
by dx dy dz) gives ∂s/∂z as before. Now choose the order z, y, x and the
ﬁrst diﬀerentiation gives R dz, the second u dy dz, and the third, after di-
vision by dx dy dz, gives ∂u/∂x. But when y is kept constant, we have
dQ = s dx + u dz, so that
∂s
∂z = ∂u
∂x,
as we wished to show.
237.
We let
V =
x2y
a2 −z2 ,
and we take the three derivatives as many times as the order of the variables
x, y, and z can change:

From this example it is clear that no matter in what order the variables are
taken, after the three diﬀerentiations we always have the same expression
4xz dx dy dz
(a2 −z2)2 .
238.
Just as after three diﬀerentiations we arrived at the same expres-
sion, so we detect some agreement after the second diﬀerentiation. Among
these each expression occurs twice. It is clear that those formulas with the
same diﬀerentials are equal to each other, and the third diﬀerentials are all
equal to each other because they all have the same diﬀerentials dx dy dz.
From this we conclude that if V is a function of howsoever many variables
x, y, z, v, u, . . . and V is diﬀerentiated successively the number of times re-
quired so that always only one quantity is variable, then as often as we
arrive at expressions with the same diﬀerentials, those expressions will be
equal to each other. Thus, after two diﬀerentiations we ﬁnd an expression
Z dx dy where in one only x is variable and in the other only y is variable,
no matter which is ﬁrst or second. In a similar way there are six ways by

7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
139
which the triple diﬀerentiation arrives at the same expression Z dx dy dz.
There are twenty-four ways of taking four derivatives to arrive at the same
expression of the form Z dx dy dz dv, and so forth.
239.
One can easily agree to the truths of these theorems with little at-
tention paid to the principles explained earlier, and one can more easily see
this truth by one’s own meditation than by such complications of words,
without which it is not possible to give a demonstration. But since a knowl-
edge of these properties is of the greatest importance in integral calculus,
beginners should be warned that they must not only meditate on these
properties with great care and examine their truth, but also work through
many examples. In this way they will become very familiar with this ma-
terial, and then they will be able more easily to gather the fruit which
will come later. Indeed, not only beginners, but also those who are already
acquainted with the principles of diﬀerential calculus are exhorted to the
same, since in almost all introductions to this part of analysis this argument
is wont to be omitted. Frequently, authors have been content to give only
the rules for diﬀerentiation and the applications to higher geometry. They
do not inquire into the nature or the properties of diﬀerentials, from which
the greatest aid to integral calculus comes. For this reason the argument,
which is practically new in this chapter, has been discussed at length in
order that the way to other more diﬃcult integrations may be prepared,
and the work to be undertaken later might be lightened.
240.
Once we know these properties that functions of two or more vari-
ables enjoy, we can easily decide whether or not a given formula for a
diﬀerential in which there occur two or more variables has really arisen
from diﬀerentiation of some ﬁnite function. If in the formula P dx + Q dy
it is not true that ∂P/∂y = ∂Q/∂x, then we can with certainty state that
there is no function of x and y whose diﬀerential is equal to P dx + Q dy.
When we come to integral calculus we will deny that there is any integral
for such a formula. Hence since yx dx + x2dy does not have the required
condition, there is no function whose diﬀerential is equal to yx dx + x2dy.
The question is whether as long as ∂P/∂y = ∂Q/∂x, the formula has al-
ways arisen from the diﬀerentiation of some function. From the principles
of integration we can surely answer in the aﬃrmative.
241. If in a given formula of a diﬀerential there are three or more variables,
such as P dx+Q dy +R dz, then there is no way that this shall have arisen
from diﬀerentiation unless these three conditions are met:
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x ,
∂P
∂z = ∂R
∂x ,
∂Q
∂z = ∂R
∂y .
Of these conditions, if even only one is missing, then we can state with

140
7. On the Diﬀerentiation of Functions of Two or More Variables
certainty that there is no function of x, y, and z whose diﬀerential is P dx+
Q dy + R dz. For such a formula we cannot require an integral, and such
is said not to be integrable. It can easily be understood that in integral
calculus we ought to investigate the diﬀerential formulas to see whether
they can be integrated before actually working to ﬁnd the integral.

8
On the Higher Diﬀerentiation
of Diﬀerential Formulas
242.
If there is a single variable and its diﬀerential is held constant, we
have already given the method for ﬁnding diﬀerentials of any order. That
is, if the diﬀerential of any function is diﬀerentiated again, we obtain its sec-
ond diﬀerential. If this is again diﬀerentiated, we get the third diﬀerential,
and so forth. This same rule holds whether the function involves several
variables or only one, whose ﬁrst diﬀerential is not kept constant. Hence,
if V is any function of x and dx is not held constant, but is as if it were
a variable, then the diﬀerential of dx is equal to d2x. The diﬀerential of
d2x is equal to d3x, and so forth. Let us investigate the second and higher
diﬀerentials of the function V .
243.
We let the ﬁrst diﬀerential of the function V be equal to P dx,
where P is some function of x depending on V . If we want to ﬁnd the
second diﬀerential of V , we must diﬀerentiate again its ﬁrst diﬀerential
P dx. Since this is the product of two variable quantities, P and dx, whose
diﬀerentials respectively are dP = p dx and d.dx = d2x, then according to
the product rule the second diﬀerential is
d2V = P d2x + p dx2.
Then if we let dp = q dx, since the diﬀerential of dx2 is equal to 2dx d2x,
we have by another diﬀerentiation
d3V = P d3x + dP d2x + 2p dx d2x + dp dx2.

142
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
Since dP = p dx and dp = q dx, we have
d3V = P d3x + 3p dx d2x + q dx3.
We ﬁnd the higher diﬀerentials in a similar way.
244.
Now we apply this to powers of x, whose successive diﬀerentials we
investigate, supposing that dx is not kept constant.
I. If V = x, then
dV = dx,
d2V = d2x,
d3V = d3x,
d4V = d4x,
. . . .
II. If V = x2, then
dV = 2x dx
and
d2V = 2x d2x + 2dx2,
d3V = 2x d3x + 6dx d2x,
d4V = 2x d4x + 8dx d3x + 6d2x2,
d5V = 2x d5x + 10dx d4x + 20d2x d3x,
. . . .
III. If in general V = xn, then and
dV = nxn−1dx,
d2V = nxn−1d2x + n (n −1) xn−2dx2,
d3V = nxn−1d3x
+ 3n (n −1) xn−2dx d2x + n (n −1) (n −2) xn−3dx3,
d4V = nxn−1d4x + 4n (n −1) xn−2dx d3x + 3n (n −1) xn−2d2x2
+ 6n (n −1) (n −2) xn−3dx2d2x
+ n (n −1) (n −2) (n −3) xn−4dx4,
. . . .
If dx happens to be constant, then d2x = 0, d3x = 0, d4x = 0, and so
forth. Thus we have the same diﬀerentials we found earlier under this
hypothesis.

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
143
245.
Since diﬀerentials of any order are diﬀerentiated according to the
same rules as are ﬁnite quantities, any expression in which diﬀerentials
occur besides ﬁnite quantities can be diﬀerentiated according to the rules
given above. Since this operation occurs not infrequently, we illustrate this
with a few examples.
I. If V = x d2x
dx2 , we diﬀerentiate to obtain
dV = x d3x
dx2 + d2x
dx −2x d2x2
dx3
.
II. If V = x
dx, then
dV = 1 −x d2x
dx2 ,
where there is no problem if we let V be an inﬁnite quantity.
III. If
V = x2 ln
d2x
dx2

,
we ﬁrst transform V into x2 ln d2x−2x2 ln dx, and then by the ordinary
rules for diﬀerentiating we have
dV = 2x dx ln d2x + x2d3x
d2x
−4x dx ln dx −2x2d2x
dx
.
The higher diﬀerentials of V can be found in a similar way.
246. If the given expression involves two variables, namely x and y, either
only one of the diﬀerentials can be kept constant, or neither. It is arbitrary
which of the diﬀerentials is assumed to be constant, since it depends on
our choice of the extent to which we want successive values to increase.
However, we cannot decide to keep both diﬀerentials constant, since this
would assume some relationship between x and y, while we have assumed
that there is no such relationship, or if there is, that it is unknown. If
we suppose that x increases equally and y also takes equal increments,
then by that fact we would have y = ax + b, and hence y would depend
on x, which is contrary to the hypothesis. For this reason either only one
diﬀerential of a variable is kept constant, or neither is kept constant. If we
know how to perform diﬀerentiations with no diﬀerential taken as constant,
it is clear how to ﬁnd diﬀerentials if one diﬀerential is kept constant: If dx
is constant, we need only let the terms that contain d2x, d3x, d4x, and so
forth, be deleted.

144
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
247. We let V be any ﬁnite function of x and y, and let dV = P dx+Q dy.
In order to ﬁnd the second diﬀerential of V we suppose that both of the
diﬀerentials dx and dy are variable. Since P and Q are functions of x and
y, we let
dP = p dx + r dy,
dQ = r dx + q dy,
since we have already noted that
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x = r.
Under these conditions we diﬀerentiate dV = P dx + Q dy and obtain
d2V = P d2x + p dx2 + 2r dx dy + Q d2y + q dy2.
Hence, if we suppose that dx is constant, then
d2V = p dx2 + 2r dx dy + Q d2y + q dy2.
On the other hand, if we suppose that dy is constant, then
d2V = P d2x + p dx2 + 2r dx dy + q dy2.
248.
Therefore, if any function of x and y is diﬀerentiated twice, with
neither diﬀerential held constant, the second diﬀerential always has the
form
d2V = P d2x + Q d2y + R dx2 + S dy2 + T dx dy;
where the quantities P, Q, R, S, and T are so interrelated that when we
use the notation used in the previous chapter,
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x ,
R = ∂P
∂x ,
S = ∂Q
∂y ,
T = 2∂Q
∂x = 2∂P
∂y .
If any one of these conditions fails, then we can aﬃrm with certainty that
the proposed formula cannot be the second diﬀerential of a function. Here
we have an immediate test of whether or not an expression of this kind is
the second diﬀerential of some quantity.
249.
In a similar way the third diﬀerential and higher diﬀerentials are
found. It would seem to be helpful to show a particular example rather
than give general formulas.

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
145
Let V = xy, so that
dV = y dx + x dy,
d2V = y d2x + 2dx dy + x d2y,
d3V = y d3x + 3dy d2x + 3d2y dx + x d3y,
d4V = y d4x + 4dy d3x + 6d2x d2y + 4dx d3y + x d4y,
. . . .
In this example the numerical coeﬃcients follow the law of the powers of a
binomial, so that this can be continued howsoever far one wishes.
If V = y/x, then

. . . .
In this example the sequence of diﬀerentials is not as clear as in the previous
example.
250. This method of diﬀerentiation is not conﬁned only to ﬁnite functions.
It can also be extended to any expression that already contains diﬀerentials.
The diﬀerential can be found whether or not some diﬀerential is assumed to
remain constant. Since each diﬀerential is diﬀerentiated by the same laws
as ﬁnite quantities, the rules given in the preceding chapters are still valid
and should be observed. Let V denote such an expression that we need to
diﬀerentiate, whether it is ﬁnite or inﬁnitely large or inﬁnitely small. The
method of diﬀerentiation can be seen from the following examples.
I. Let V =

dx2 + dy2. Then
dV = dx d2x + dy d2y

dx2 + dy2
.
II. Let V = y dx
dy . Then
dV = dx + y d2x
dy
−y dx d2y

.

.
Since these diﬀerentials are taken most generally, with no diﬀerential taken
to be constant, from these it is easy to derive the diﬀerentials that arise
when either dx or dy is held constant.
251.
Since we are assuming that none of the diﬀerentials are constant,
we can give no law according to which the second diﬀerentials and those of
higher order can be determined, nor do they have a deﬁnite meaning. Hence
the formula for the second diﬀerential and those of higher order have no
determined value, unless some diﬀerential is assumed to be constant. But
even its signiﬁcation will be vague and will change depending on which of
the diﬀerentials are held constant. There are, however, some expressions
that for second diﬀerentials, although no diﬀerential is held constant, still
have a determined signiﬁcation. This always remains the same, no matter
which diﬀerential we decide to hold constant. Below we will consider very
carefully the nature of formulas of this kind, and we will discuss the way
in which these may be distinguished from those others that do not include
any determined values.
252.
In order that we may more easily see the kind of formulas that
contain second or higher diﬀerentials, we consider ﬁrst formulas containing
only a single variable. It will then be perfectly clear that if in such a formula
there is a second diﬀerential of the variable x, d2x, and no diﬀerential is
held constant, then it is not possible for the formula to have a ﬁxed value.
Indeed, if we decided that the diﬀerential of x should be constant, then
d2x = 0. However, if we held constant the diﬀerential of x2, that is, 2x dx,
or even x dx, since the diﬀerential of x dx is x d2x + dx2, this expression
is equal to zero, so that d2x = −dx2/x. Indeed, if the diﬀerential of some
power, for example nxn−1dx or xn−1dx, should be constant, then its second
diﬀerential satisﬁes
xn−1d2x + (n −1) xn−2dx2 = 0,
so that
d2x = −(n −1) dx2
x
.

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
147
Diﬀerent values for d2x will be given if the diﬀerentials of other functions
of x are held constant. However, it is clear that the formulas in which d2x
occurs take on quite diﬀerent values depending on whether in place of d2x
we write zero or −dx2/x or −(n −1) dx2/x or some other expression of this
kind. For instance, if the given formula is x2d2x/dx2, then, because d2x and
dx2 are both inﬁnitely small and homogeneous, the expression should have
a ﬁnite value. If dx is made constant, the expression becomes zero; if d.x2
is constant, it becomes −x; if d.x3 is constant, it becomes −2x; if d.x4 is
constant, it becomes −3x, and so forth. Hence, it can have no determined
value unless the diﬀerential of something is assumed to be constant.
253.
This ambiguity of signiﬁcation is present, for a similar reason, if the
third diﬀerential is present in some formula. Let us consider the formula
x3d3x
dx d2x,
which also has a ﬁnite value. If the diﬀerential dx is constant, then the
formula takes the form 0/0, whose value we will soon see. Let d.x2 be
constant. Then d2x = −dx2/x and after another diﬀerentiation we obtain
d3x = −2dx d2x
x
+ dx3
x2 = 3dx3
x2 ,
since d2x = −dx2/x. Hence, for this reason, the given formula
x3d3x
dx d2x
becomes −3x2. However, if d.xn is constant, then
d2x = −(n −1) dx2
x
,
so that
d3x = −2 (n −1) dx d2x
x
+ (n −1) dx3
x2
= 2 (n −1)2 dx3
x2
+ (n −1) dx3
x2
,
= (2n −1) (n −1) dx3
x2
.
Hence for this reason we have
d3x
d2x = (2n −1) dx
x
and
x3d3x
dx d2x = −(2n −1) x2.

148
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
It follows that if n = 1, or dx is constant, the value of the formula will be
equal to −x2. From this it is clear that if in any formula there occurs a
third or higher diﬀerential and at the same time it is not indicated which
of these diﬀerentials are taken to be constant, then that formula has no
certain value and can have no further signiﬁcance. For this reason such
expressions cannot occur in the calculation.
254.
In a similar way, if the formula contains two or more variables and
there occur diﬀerentials of the second or higher order, it should be under-
stood that it can have no determined value unless some diﬀerential is con-
stant, with the exception of some special cases that we will soon consider.
Since as soon as d2x is in some formula, due to the various diﬀerentials
that can be constant, the value of d2x always changes. The result is that it
is impossible that the formula should have a stated value. The same is true
for any higher diﬀerential of x and also for the second and higher diﬀeren-
tials of the other variables. However, if a formula contains the diﬀerentials
of two or more variables, it can happen that the variability arising from
one is destroyed by the variability of the others. It is for this reason that
we have that exceptional case that we mentioned, in which a formula of
this kind, involving second diﬀerentials of two or more variables, can have
a deﬁnite value, even though no diﬀerential is held constant.
255.
The formula
y d2x + x d2y
dx dy
can have no ﬁxed and stated signiﬁcation unless one of the ﬁrst diﬀerentials
is set constant. If dx is made constant, then we have
x d2y
dx dy .
On the other hand, if dy is made constant, we have
y d2x
dx dy .
It should be clear that these formulas need not be equal. If they were
necessarily equal, they would remain the same when any function of x is
substituted for y. Let us suppose that y = x2. When we set dx constant we
have d2y = 2dx2, and the formula
x d2y
dx dy
becomes equal to 1. However, if dy, that is 2x dx, is set constant, then
d2y = 2x d2x + 2dx2 = 0, so that d2x = −dx2/x, and the formula
y d2x
dx dy

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
149
becomes equal to −1
2. Since we have this contradiction in a single case,
much less is it possible in general that
x d2y
dx dy ,
when dx is constant, is equal to
y d2x
dx dy ,
when dy is constant. Since the formula
y d2x + x d2y
dx dy
has no ﬁxed meaning even though either dx or dy is constant, much less
will there be a ﬁxed meaning if the diﬀerential of an arbitrary function of
either x of y or both is set equal to a constant.
256.
Thus it appears that a formula of this kind cannot have a stated
value unless it is so made up that when for y or z or any function of x is
substituted, the second and higher diﬀerentials of x, namely d2x, d3x, etc.,
no longer remain in the calculation. Indeed, if after any such substitution
whatsoever in the formula there remains d2x or d3x or d4x, etc., the value
of this formula remains unsettled. This is because as diﬀerent constants are
assigned, the diﬀerentials take on diﬀerent meanings. The formula we have
just discussed,
y d2x + x d2y
dx dy
,
is of this kind. If this formula had a ﬁxed value, no matter what y should
signify, the stated value should remain the same if y represents any func-
tion or x. But if we let y = x, the formula becomes 2x d2x/dx2, which is
undetermined due to the presence of d2x, so that it takes on various values
according to the various diﬀerentials that are made constant. This should
be suﬃciently clear from the discussion in paragraph 252.
257.
From this there arises a doubt as to the existence of any formulas
that contain two or more second, or higher, diﬀerentials that still have the
property that when arbitrary functions of one of the variables are substi-
tuted for the other variables, then the second diﬀerentials are eliminated.
We propose this doubt in order to present a formula that has this pre-
cise property. By this investigation we will more easily see the force of the
question. I say that the following formula has this remarkable property:
dy d2x + dx d2y
dx3
.
Indeed, no matter what function of x we substitute for y, the second dif-
ferentials always vanish completely.

150
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
I. Let y = x2. Then dy = 2xdx and d2y = 2x d2x + 2dx2. When these
values are substituted into the formula
dy d2x −dx d2y
dx3
,
we have
2x dx d2x −2x dx d2x −2dx3
dx3
= −2.
II. Let y = xn. Then dy = nxn−1dx and
d2y = nxn−1d2x + n (n −1) xn−2dx2.
When these values are substituted, the formula
dy d2x −dx d2y
dx3
is transformed into
nxn−1dx d2x −nxn−1dx d2x −n (n −1) xn−2dx3
dx3
= −n (n −1) xn−2.
III. Let y = −
√
1 −x2. Then
dy =
x dx
√
1 −x2
and
d2y =
x d2x
√
1 −x2 +
dx2
(1 −x2)3/2 ,
so that the formula
dy d2x −dx d2y
dx3
becomes
x d2x
dx2√
1 −x2 −
x d2x
dx2√
1 −x2 −
1
(1 −x2)3/2 =
−1
(1 −x2)3/2 .
In all of these examples the second diﬀerentials d2x cancel each other. This
also happens no matter what other functions of x are substituted for y.
258.
Since these examples have already shown the truth of our proposi-
tion, namely, that the formula
dy d2x −dx d2y
dx3

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
151
has a ﬁxed value, even though no diﬀerential is assumed to be constant, all
the more easily we can furnish a demonstration. Let y be any function or x,
and then dy is its diﬀerential, so that dy = p dx, where p is some function
of x. The diﬀerential of p will have the form dp = q dx and q is a function
of x. Since dy = p dx, by diﬀerentiation we have d2y = pd2x + q dx2 and
dy d2x −dx d2y = p dx d2x −p dx d2x −q dx3 = −q dx3.
In this expression, since there is no second diﬀerential, it has a ﬁxed value
and
dy d2x −dx d2y
dx3
= −q.
No matter how y depends on x, the second diﬀerentials in this formula
vanish. For this reason its value is quite ﬁxed, although in other respects
it may be unsettled.
259.
Although we have here supposed that y is a function of x, never-
theless the truth of the assertion remains true even if y does not depend
on x at all. While we substitute for y an arbitrary function, and whatever
kind it might be we do not determine, we attribute to y no dependence
on x. Meanwhile, with no mention of a function, a demonstration can be
given. No matter what quantity y might be, whether it depends on x or
not, its diﬀerential dy will be homogeneous with dx, so that dy/dx will be
some ﬁnite quantity p. The diﬀerential of p that we take when x goes to
x + dx and y to y + dy will be ﬁxed, and have no dependence on the law
of second diﬀerentials. Hence, since dy/dx = p, we have dy = p dx and
d2y = pd2x + dp dx, so that
dx d2y −dy d2x = dp dx2,
and this value is not unsettled, since it contains only ﬁrst diﬀerentials.
This property is consistent whether any diﬀerential is taken as constant,
whatsoever it might be, or even if no diﬀerential is held constant.
260.
The formula dy d2x −dx d2y has a ﬁxed signiﬁcation even though it
contains second diﬀerentials, which can be thought of as destroying each
other. Any expression in which there are no other second diﬀerentials be-
sides the formula dy d2x −dx d2y likewise has a ﬁxed meaning. Now, if we
let dy d2x −dx d2y = ω and if V is a quantity formed from x, y, their ﬁrst
diﬀerentials dx, dy, and ω, then V will have a ﬁxed value. Since in the
ﬁrst diﬀerentials dx and dy there is no reason for uncertainty as to the law
by which the successive values change as x increases, and in ω the second
diﬀerentials cancel each other, so that the quantity V is not uncertain but
ﬁxed. Thus the expression

dx2 + dy23/2
dx d2y −dy d2x

152
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
has a ﬁxed value although it seems to be contaminated by second diﬀer-
entials. In addition, since the numerator is homogeneous with the denomi-
nator, it has a ﬁnite value, unless by chance it becomes inﬁnitely large or
inﬁnitely small.
261.
Just as the formula dx d2y −dy d2x has a ﬁxed value, as has been
shown, so also if a third variable z is added, these formulas dx d2z −dz d2x
and dy d2z −dz d2y have ﬁxed values. Hence, expressions in three variables
x, y, and z, provided that there are no second diﬀerentials except these, then
the expression will be ﬁxed, just as if they contained no second diﬀerential
at all. It follows that this expression

dx2 + dy2 + dz23/2
(dx + dz) d2y −(dy + dz) d2x + (dx −dy) d2z ,
although it does contain second diﬀerentials, still it keeps a ﬁxed signiﬁ-
cation. In a similar way it is possible to exhibit formulas containing many
variables in which second diﬀerentials do not prevent the formulas from
having a ﬁxed signiﬁcance.
262.
Except for formulas of this kind, all others that contain second dif-
ferentials will give uncertain signiﬁcation, and for this reason they have no
place in calculations. On the other hand, a ﬁrst diﬀerential may be deﬁned
to be constant. As soon as any ﬁrst diﬀerential is assumed to be constant,
all expressions, no matter how many variables they may contain and no
matter what diﬀerentials higher than the ﬁrst may be present, obtain ﬁxed
signiﬁcance, and they are no longer excluded from calculations. For exam-
ple, if dx is assumed to be constant, the second diﬀerential of x and all
higher diﬀerentials vanish. Whatsoever functions of x may be substituted
for the other variables y, z, and so forth, their second diﬀerentials through
dx2, their third through dx3, and so forth, will be determined. In this way
the ambiguity is removed from the second diﬀerentials. The same thing
is true if the ﬁrst diﬀerential of some other variable or function is made
constant.
263.
From this it follows that second and higher diﬀerentials never enter
into a calculation, and because of their unsettled signiﬁcation they are
completely unsuitable for analysis. Now, when second diﬀerentials seem to
be present, either some ﬁrst diﬀerential is assumed to be constant, or this is
not the case. In the ﬁrst case, the second diﬀerentials simply vanish, since
they are determined by the ﬁrst diﬀerential. In the latter case, unless they
cancel each other, the signiﬁcation is unsettled, and for this reason they
have no place in analysis. On the other hand, if they cancel each other,
they only seem to be present, and only ﬁnite quantities with their ﬁrst
diﬀerentials are to be considered really present. However, since they very
frequently only seem to be used in calculations, it was necessary that the

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
153
method of dealing with them be explained. Soon, now, we will show the
method by means of which second and higher diﬀerentials can always be
eradicated.
264.
If an expression contains a single variable x and its higher diﬀer-
entials d2x, d3x, d4x, etc. occur in the expression, then it can have no
ﬁxed meaning unless some ﬁrst diﬀerential is set constant. Thus, let t be
that variable whose diﬀerential dt is set constant. Then d2t = 0, d3t = 0,
d4t = 0, etc. We let dx = p dt, and p will be a ﬁnite quantity whose diﬀer-
ential is not aﬀected by the unsettled signiﬁcation of second diﬀerentials;
furthermore, dp/dt will be a ﬁnite quantity. Let dp = q dt, and in a similar
way dq = r dt, dr = s dt, etc. Here q, r, s, etc. are ﬁnite quantities with
ﬁxed signiﬁcation. Since dx = p dt, we have
d2x = dp dt = q dt2,
d3x = dq dt2 = r dt3,
d4x = dr dt3 = s dt4,
. . . .
If these values are substituted for d2x, d3x, d4x, and so forth, the whole
expression will contain only ﬁnite expressions and the ﬁrst diﬀerential of
dt, nor will there be any unsettled signiﬁcation.
265.
If x were a function of t, then in this way the quantity x could be
completely eliminated, so that only the quantity t and its diﬀerential dt
would remain in the expression. However, if t were a function of x, then
x would also be a function of t. Nevertheless, this quantity x with its ﬁrst
diﬀerential dx can be retained in the calculation, provided that after the
substitutions previously made for t and dt, the values expressed by x and
dx are restored. In order that this might become clearer, we will let t = xn,
so that the ﬁrst diﬀerential of xn will be held constant. Since dt = nxn−1dx,
we have p = 1/

nxn−1
and
dp = −(n −1) dx
nxn
= q dt = nqxn−1dx,
so that
q = −(n −1)
n2x2n−1
and
dq = (n −1) (2n −1) dx
n2x2n
= r dt = nrxn−1dx.
From this it follows that
r = (n −1) (2n −1)
n3x3n−1

and
s = −(n −1) (2n −1) (3n −1)
n4x4n−1
.
Hence, if we let the diﬀerential of xn be constant, then
d2x = −(n −1) dx2
x
,
d3x = (n −1) (2n −1) dx3
x2
,
d4x = −(n −1) (2n −1) (3n −1) dx4
x3
,
and so forth.
266. If an expression contains two variables x and y, and if the diﬀerential
of one, x, is held constant, then since d2x = 0, there will be no second or
higher diﬀerentials besides d2y, d3y, etc. However, these can be treated
in the same way as before. They can be removed by letting dy = p dx,
dp = q dx, dq = r dx, dr = s dx, and so forth. Then we have
d2y = q dx2,
d3y = r dx3,
d4y = s dx4,
. . . ,
and so forth. By means of these substitutions we obtain an expression that
contains only the diﬀerential dx besides the ﬁnite quantities x, y, p, q, r,
s, etc. For example, if the given expression is
y dx4 + x dy d3y + x d4y
(x2 + y2) d2y
,
in which we assume that dx is constant, then we let dy = p dx, dp = q dx,
dq = r dx, and dr = s dx. When these values are substituted the given
expression is transformed into
(y + xpr + xs) dx2
(x2 + y2) q
,
which contains no second or higher diﬀerential.
267.
In a similar way the second and higher diﬀerentials are removed if
dy is assumed to be constant. However, if any other ﬁrst diﬀerential dt is
taken to be constant, then the higher diﬀerentials of x are removed from
the calculation with the method ﬁrst mentioned before. That is, we let
dx = p dt,
dp = q dt,
dq = r dt,
dr = s dt,
. . . ,
so that
d2x = q dt2,
d3x = r dt3,
d4x = s dt4,
. . . .

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
155
Then in a similar way for the higher diﬀerentials of y we let
dy = P dt,
dP = Q dt,
dQ = R dt,
dR = S dt,
. . . ,
so that
d2y = Q dt2,
d3y = R dt3,
d4y = S dt4,
. . . .
When these substitutions are made we obtain an expression that contains
only the diﬀerential dt besides the ﬁnite quantities x, p, q, r, s, etc. y, P,
Q, R, S, etc. It follows that there is no unsettled signiﬁcation.
268. If the ﬁrst diﬀerential that is made constant depends on x or on y, or
if it depends on both at the same time, then it is not necessary to introduce
a pair of series of ﬁnite quantities p, q, r, etc. Indeed, if dt depends only on
x, then the letters p, q, r, etc. will be functions of x, and only the letters
P, Q, R, etc. will be present. The same thing will occur if the constant
diﬀerential dt depends only on y. However, if dt depends on both, then the
operation must be changed a bit. For example, we let the diﬀerential y dx
be constant, so that y d2x + dx dy = 0 and
d2x = −dx dy
y
.
Now let
dy = p dx,
dp = q dx,
dq = r dx,
. . . ,
so that
d2x = −p dx2
y
.
When we diﬀerentiate further, we obtain
d3x = −q dx3
y
+ p2dx2
y2
−2p dx d2x
y
,
and when we substitute −p dx2/y for d2x we have
d3x = −q dx3

Furthermore,
d4x = −r dx4

and again substituting −p dx2/y for d2x we have

and so forth. When these values are substituted for the higher diﬀerentials
of x and y, a given expression is transformed into a form of the kind which
no longer contains higher diﬀerentials. This is accomplished by considering
some diﬀerential to be constant.
269.
Frequently in the application of calculus to curves it may happen
that the ﬁrst diﬀerential

dx2 + dy2 is assumed to be constant. For this
reason we now show the way in which for this case the second and higher
diﬀerentials should be eliminated. At the same time, by using the same ar-
gument, the way will be opened to show the process if any other diﬀerential
is assumed to be constant. Now we let
dy = p dx,
dp = q dx,
dq = r dx,
dr = s dx,
. . . .
Then the diﬀerential

dx2 + dy2 takes the form dx

1 + p2. Since this is
constant, we have
d2x

1 + p2 +
pq dx2

1 + p2 = 0,
so that
d2x = −pq dx2
1 + p2 ,
and we already have the value of d2x. Furthermore, we have
d3x = −pr dx3
1 + p2 −q2dx3
1 + p2 + 2p2q2dx3
(1 + p2)2 −2pq dx d2x
1 + p2
= −pr dx3

Since we are assuming that dy = p dx, when this is diﬀerentiated, we have
d2y = q dx2 + pd2x = q dx2 −p2q dx2
1 + p2 = q dx2
1 + p2 ,
d3y = r dx3
1 + p2 −2pq2dx3
(1 + p2)2 + 2q dx d2x

so that
d3y = r dx3

Hence all higher diﬀerentials of both x and y are expressed through ﬁ-
nite quantities and powers of dx. After these substitutions, the resulting
expression is completely free of second diﬀerentials.
270.
Now that we have given the method for stripping second and higher
diﬀerentials from expressions, it is ﬁtting that we illustrate this material
with some few examples.
I. Let the given expression be x d2y/dx2, in which dx is set constant.
Hence we let dy = p dx and dp = q dx, so that d2y = q dx2 and the
given expression becomes this ﬁnite quantity xq.
II. Let the given expression be

dx2 + dy2
/d2x, in which dy is set con-
stant. We let dx = pdy, dp = q dy. Since d2x = q dy2, we obtain

1 + p2
/q. However, if we should wish, as before, to let dy = p dx,
dp = q dx, since dy is constant, we have 0 = pd2x + dp dx and
d2x = −q dx2/p. Hence the given expression becomes −p

1 + p2
/q.
III. Let the given expression be
y d2x −x d2y
dx dy
,
in which y dx is set constant. We let dy = p dx and dp = q dx; from
paragraph 268 we have d2x = −p dx2/y and
d2y = q dx2 −p2dx2
y
.

158
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
When these are substituted into the given expression, it is transformed
into
−1 −xq
p + xp
y .
IV. Let the given expression be
dx2 + dy2
d2y
,
in which we let

dx2 + dy2 be constant. Again we let dy = p dx,
dp = q dx, and from the preceding paragraph we have
d2y = q dx2
1 + p2 .
Hence the given expression becomes

1 + p22/q.
From these examples it should be suﬃciently clear, in any given case, the
way in which second and higher diﬀerentials should be eliminated when
any ﬁrst diﬀerential is assumed to be constant.
271.
Since second and higher diﬀerentials can be eliminated by introduc-
ing ﬁnite quantities p, q, r, s, etc., so that the whole expression is made
up only of the diﬀerential dx and the ﬁnite quantities p, q, r, s, etc., if
an expression reduced in this manner is given, we can again recover the
original form by substituting second and higher diﬀerentials for the letters
p, q, r, s, etc. Now in the same way, some ﬁrst diﬀerential is assumed to
be constant, whether it be the one originally so assumed, or some other.
However, it could be that no diﬀerential was assumed to be constant while
it contains second and higher diﬀerentials and at the same time it has a
ﬁxed signiﬁcation. We have seen expressions of this kind above.
272.
Now let any given expression contain the ﬁnite letters x, y, p, q, r,
etc. with one diﬀerential dx, in which
p = dy
dx,
q = dp
dx,
r = dq
dx,
. . . .
If we wish to eliminate these letters, in their place we introduce second and
higher diﬀerentials of x and y with no diﬀerential assumed to be constant.
Since
dp = dx d2y −dy d2x
dx2
,
so that
q = dx d2y −dy d2x
dx3
,

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
159
this formula gives
dq = dx2d3y −3dx d2x d2y + 3dy d2x2 −dx dy d3x
dx4
,
so that
r = dx2d3y −3dx d2x d2y + 3dy d2x2 −dx dy d3x
dx5
.
Furthermore, if the letter s, which indicates the value of dr/dx, is in the
expression, then
s = dx3d4y −6dx2d2xd3y −4dx2d2y d3x + 15dx d2x2d2y
dx7
+ 10dx dy d2xd3x −15dy d2x3 −dx2dy d4x
dx7
.
When these values are substituted for p, q, r, s, etc., into the given expres-
sion, that expression is transformed into another one that contains higher
diﬀerentials of x and y. Even though no ﬁrst diﬀerential is assumed to be
constant, still the expression has a ﬁxed signiﬁcation.
273.
In this way any formula for a higher diﬀerential in which some ﬁrst
diﬀerential is assumed to be constant can be transformed into another form,
in which no diﬀerential is set equal to a constant, and in spite of this it
still has a ﬁxed value. First, by means of the method already discussed, we
take the values dy = p dx, dp = q dx, dq = r dx, dr = s dx, etc., and the
higher diﬀerentials are eliminated. Then for p, q, r, s, etc., we substitute the
values just discovered and this transformation is illustrated by the following
examples.
I. Let the given expression be x d2y/dx2, in which we let dx be constant.
We would like to transform this into another form that involves no
constant diﬀerential. We let dy = p dx, dp = q dx, and, as seen before
in paragraph 270, the given expression becomes qx. Now for q we
substitute the value we obtain when no diﬀerential is constant, namely,
q = dx d2y −dy d2x
dx3
.
The resulting expression is then equal to
x dx d2y −x dy d2x
dx3
,
and this involves no other constant diﬀerential.

160
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
II. Let the given expression be
dx2 + dy2
d2x
,
in which dy is assumed to be constant. We let dy = p dx and dp = q dx,
so that the expression becomes −p

1 + p2
/q, as in paragraph 270.
Since
p = dy
dx
and
q = dx d2y −dy d2x
dx3
,
we obtain the expression
dy

dx2 + dy2
dy d2x −dx d2y .
Here no diﬀerential is assumed constant, and this expression has the
same value as the one originally proposed.
III. Let the given expression be
y d2x −x d2y
dx dy
,
in which the diﬀerential y dx is assumed to be constant. We let dy =
p dx, dp = q dx, and as we saw in paragraph 270, this expression is
transformed into
−1 −xq
p + xp
y .
When we do not assume any diﬀerential to be constant, the expression
is transformed into
−1 −x dx d2y −x dy d2x
dx2dy
+ x dy
y dx
= x dx dy2 −y dx2dy −yx dx d2y + yx dy d2x
y dx2dy
.
IV. Let the given expression be
dx2 + dy2
d2y
,
in which we assume that the diﬀerential

dx2 + dy2 is constant.
When we let dy = p dx and dp = q dx, there arises the expression

1 + p22/q as in paragraph 270. Now we set p = dy/dx and
q = dx d2y −dy d2x
dx3

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
161
with no diﬀerential being constant, and the expression

dx2 + dy22
dx2d2y −dx dy d2x
becomes equivalent to the proposed expression.
V. Let the given expression be dx d3y/d2y, in which the diﬀerential dx is
assumed to be constant. We let dy = p dx, dp = q dx, and dq = r dx.
Since d2y = q dx2 and d3y = r dx3, the given formula becomes r dx2/q.
Now for q and r we substitute those values that they receive when no
diﬀerential is assumed to be constant, that is,
q = dx d2y −dy d2x
dx3
and
r = dx2d3y −3dx d2x d2y + 3dy d2x2 −dx dy d3x
dx5
.
We then obtain the following expression, which is equivalent to that
originally given:
dx2d3y −3dx d2x d2y + 3dy d2x2 −dx dy d3x
dx d2y −dy d2x
= dx

dx d3y −dy d3x

dx d2y −dy d2x
−3d2x.
274.
If we consider these transformations more carefully, we can ﬁnd a
more expeditious method in which it is not necessary to resort to the letters
p, q, r, etc. Depending on which diﬀerential in the formula is assumed to
be constant, diﬀerent methods are used. First, suppose that the constant
diﬀerential is dx. When we have substituted p dx for dy and conversely
dy/dx for p, whenever the diﬀerentials dx or dy occur, they are retained
without alteration. However, wherever d2y occurs, after we have substituted
q dx2 and then for q we have written the value
dx d2y −dy d2x
dx
or
d2y −dy d2x
dx
,
the transformation is complete. Furthermore, if in the given expression d3y
occurs, since we have substituted r dx3, because of the value already found
for r, whenever d3y is found we write
d3y −3d2x d2y
dx
+ 3dy d2x2
dx2
−dy d3x
dx
.

162
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
When this is done, the given expression is transformed into a diﬀerent one
that involves no constant diﬀerential. For example, if the given expression
is

dx2 + dy23/2
dx d2y
and dx is set constant, when
d2y −dy d2x
dx
is substituted for d2y, the new form with no constant diﬀerential is

dx2 + dy23/2
dx d2y −dy d2x.
275.
From this it is easily gathered that whenever in some expression the
diﬀerential dy is constant, then wherever we ﬁnd d2x we should write
d2x −dx d2y
dy
and for d3x we write
d3x −3d2x d2y
dy
+ 3dx d2y2
dy2
−dx d3y
dy
,
in order to obtain an equivalent expression in which no diﬀerential is set
constant. However, if in the given expression y dx is assumed constant, then
according to paragraph 268, we have
d2x = −p dx2
y
and
d2y = q dx2 −p2dx2
y
.
In place of d2x we should everywhere write −dx dy/y and in place of d2y
we should everywhere write
d2y −dy d2x
dx
−dy2
y .
Since the higher diﬀerentials seldom occur in this business, we will progress
no further. However, if in the given expression the diﬀerential

dx2 + dy2
is assumed constant, since in paragraph 269 we obtained
d2x = −pq dx2
1 + p2
and
d2y = q dx2
1 + p2 ,
for d2x we should everywhere write
dy2d2x −dx dy d2y
dx2 + dy2
,

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
163
and for d2y we everywhere write
dx2d2y −dx dy d2x
dx2 + dy2
.
Hence, if the given expression is
dy

dx2 + dy2
d2x
,
in which

dx2 + dy2 is assumed to be constant, then the expression is
transformed into

dx2 + dy23/2
dy d2x −dx d2y ,
in which no diﬀerential is assumed to be constant.
276.
In order that these reductions can be used more easily, we have
brought them together in the following table.
A diﬀerential formula of higher order can be transformed into one that
involves no constant diﬀerential by means of the following substitutions:
I. If the diﬀerential dx is assumed to be constant, then for d2y we write
d2y −dy d2x
dx
and for d3y we write
d3y −3d2x d2y
dx

II. If the diﬀerential dy is assumed to be constant, then for d2x we write

and for d3x we write
d3x −3d2x d2y

we write

for d2y we write

277.
These expressions, which include no constant diﬀerential, are given
in such a way that one has freedom to choose any diﬀerential to be constant.
Hence, diﬀerential expressions of higher order in which no diﬀerential is as-
sumed to be constant, can be tested to decide whether they have unsettled
or ﬁxed signiﬁcance. We choose arbitrarily some diﬀerential, for example
dx, to be constant. Then, with the rule provided in the previous paragraph,
the expression is reduced once more to a form in which no diﬀerential is
assumed to be constant. If this agrees with the given expression, then it has

8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
165
ﬁxed signiﬁcance and does not depend on the variability of second diﬀeren-
tials. However, if we obtain a diﬀerent expression, then the given expression
has unsettled signiﬁcance. Thus, if the given expression is y d2x −x d2y, in
which no diﬀerential is set constant, we investigate whether the signiﬁcance
is unsettled or ﬁxed. We let dx be constant, so that the expression becomes
−x d2y. Now, with the ﬁrst rule of the previous paragraph, we substitute
d2y −dy d2x
dx
for d2y and obtain
−x d2y + x dy d2x
dx
.
Since these two expressions do not agree, this indicates that the given
expression has no ﬁxed and stated signiﬁcance.
278.
In a similar way if the given general expression is of the type
P d2x + Q dx dy + R d2y,
it is possible to deﬁne a condition under which the expression will have a
ﬁxed value even though no diﬀerential is assumed to be constant. When dx
is set constant, the expression becomes Q dx dy + R d2y. Now this is once
more transformed into another form, so that its signiﬁcation remains the
same, even though no diﬀerential is thought to be constant. In this way we
obtain
Q dx dy + R d2y −R dy d2x
dx
,
which agrees with the given expression, provided that P dx+R dy = 0. Only
in this case will the value of the expression be ﬁxed. Indeed, if P is not
equal to −R dy/dx or if R is not equal to −P dx/dy, the given expression
P d2x+Q dx dy+R d2y has no ﬁxed value. Its signiﬁcation will be unsettled
and vary depending on which diﬀerential is assumed to be constant.
279.
Using these principles it will be easy to convert a diﬀerential ex-
pression in which some diﬀerential is set constant into another form in
which a diﬀerent diﬀerential is assumed to be constant. We reduce the ﬁrst
expression to the form that involves no constant diﬀerential. Once this is
accomplished, we set the other diﬀerential constant. Thus if in the pro-
posed expression the diﬀerential dx is assumed to be constant, and this is
transformed into another that involves a constant dy, in the above formulas
instead of d2y and d3y, since dy is constant, we would let d2y = 0, d3y = 0,
but the desired result is obtained if for d2y we substitute
−dy d2x
dx
and
3dy d2x
dx2
−dy d3x
dx

166
8. On the Higher Diﬀerentiation of Diﬀerential Formulas
for d3y. In this way the formula

dx2 + dy23/2
dx d2y
,
in which dx is set constant, is transformed into

dx2 + dy23/2
dy d2x
,
in which dy is set constant.
280.
If, on the other hand, a formula in which dy is set constant is to be
transformed into another in which dx is constant, then for d2x we have to
substitute
−dx d2y
dy
,
and for d3x the expression
3dx d2y2
dy2
−dx d3y
dy
.
In a similar way, if a formula in which

dx2 + dy2 is set constant is to be
transformed into another in which dx is constant, then for d2x we write
−dx dy d2y
dx2 + dy2 ,
and for d2y we write
dx2d2y
dx2 + dy2 .
However, if a formula in which dx is assumed to be constant is to be
transformed into another in which

dx2 + dy2 is to be constant, since
dx2 + dy2 is constant, we have dx d2x + dy d2y = 0 and
d2x = −dy d2y
dx
.
This value is given to d2x, and for d2y we write
d2y + dy2d2y
dx2
=

dx2 + dy2
d2y
dx2
.
Hence the formula
−

dx2 + dy23/2

in which dx is constant, is transformed into another in which

dx2 + dy2
is set constant, which is

On Diﬀerential Equations
281. In this chapter we principally set forth an explanation of the diﬀeren-
tiation of those functions of x that are not deﬁned explicitly, but implicitly
by means of the relationship of x to the function y. Once this is accom-
plished, we consider the nature of diﬀerential equations in general, and
we show how they arise from ﬁnite equations. Since the main concern in
integral calculus is the solution of diﬀerential equations, that is ﬁnding ﬁ-
nite equations that correspond to the diﬀerentials, it is necessary here to
examine very carefully the nature and properties of diﬀerential equations
that follow from their origin. In this way we will be preparing the way for
integral calculus.
282.
In order that we complete this task, let y be a function of x that is
deﬁned by this quadratic expression:
y2 + Py + Q = 0.
Since this expression y2+Py+Q is equal to zero, whatever x might signify,
the equation will still be equal to zero if we substitute x + dx for x. In this
case y becomes y + dy. When this substitution is made and the original
y2 + Py + Q is subtracted from the new quantity, there remains the dif-
ferential, which is also equal to zero. From this it should be clear that if
any expression is equal to zero, then its diﬀerential will also be equal to
zero. Furthermore, if two expressions are equal to each other, then their
diﬀerentials will be equal. Since y2 + Py + Q = 0, we also have
2y dy + P dy + y dP + dQ = 0.

168
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
Since P and Q are functions of x, their diﬀerentials have the form dP = p dx
and dQ = q dx so that
2y dy + P dy + yp dx + q dx = 0,
with the result that
dy
dx = −yp + q
2y + P .
283. Now, just as the ﬁnite equation y2+Py+Q = 0 gives the relationship
between y and x, so the diﬀerential equation expresses the relationship, or
the ratio of dy to dx. However since
dy
dx = −yp + q
2y + P ,
we cannot know this ratio dy : dx unless we know the function y. Things
could not possibly be otherwise, since from the ﬁnite equation y has two
values. Either of these two values has its own proper diﬀerential, and either
diﬀerential will appear depending on which value is substituted for y. In a
similar way, the function y can be deﬁned by a cubic equation. In this case,
dy/dx will have three values, depending on which of the three values of y
is substituted. If in a given ﬁnite equation y has four or more values, then
of necessity, dy/dx has just as many signiﬁcations.
284.
Nevertheless, the function y can be eliminated, since we have two
equations containing y, namely the ﬁnite and the diﬀerential. In that case,
however, the diﬀerential dy will take on as many values as y had in the
original ﬁnite equation. Thus there are this many ratios of dy to dx. Let
us take the preceding example, y2 + Py + Q = 0, whose diﬀerential is
2y dy + P dy + y dP + dQ = 0, from which we obtain
y = −P dy + dQ
2dy + dP .
When this value for y is substituted in the previous equation, we have


285.
Once the value of dy has been found, by repeated diﬀerentiation we
ﬁnd the value of d2y, d3y, d4y, etc. Since these have no determined value
unless some ﬁrst diﬀerential is made constant, for convenience, let dx be
constant, and for an illustration, let us consider this example:
y3 + x3 = 3axy.
By diﬀerentiation we obtain
3y2dy + 3x2dx = 3ax dy + 3ay dx,
so that
dy
dx = ay −x2
y2 −ax.
Once more we take diﬀerentials with dx constant and obtain
d2y
dx = −ay2dy −a2x dy + 2x2y dy −2xy2dx + a2y dx + ax2dx
(y2 −ax)2
.
When we substitute for dy the value already obtained,
ay dx −x2dx
y2 −ax
,
and divide by dx, we have
d2y
dx2 =

ay −x2 
2x2y −ay2 −a2x

(y2 −ax)3
+ ax2 + a2y −2xy2

or
d2y
dx2 = 6ax2y2 −2x4y −2xy4 −2a3xy
(y2 −ax)3
= −
2a3xy
(y2 −ax)3 ,
since from the ﬁnite equation we have 2x4y + 2xy4 = 6ax2y2. In this way,
using the ﬁnite equation, these values can be transformed into innumerable
diﬀerent forms.
286.
A diﬀerential equation can be expressed in an inﬁnite number of
ways, since it can be combined with the ﬁnite equation. Thus, with the
preceding example we obtained the diﬀerential equation
y2dy + x2dx = ax dy + ay dx,

170
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
and if this is multiplied by y, we have
y3dy + x2y dx = axy dy + ay2dx.
If we substitute for y3 its value 3axy −x3, we obtain the new equation
2ax dy −x3dy + x2y dx = ay2dx.
If we multiply this equation again by y and then substitute for y3 its value,
we have
2axy2dy −x3y dy + x2y2dx = 3a2xy dx −ax3dx.
In general, if P, Q, R represent any functions of x and y, and if the diﬀer-
ential equation is multiplied by P, then
Py2dy + Px2dx = aPx dy + aPy dx.
Now, since x3 + y3 −3axy = 0, we also have

x3 + y3 −3axy

(Q dx + R dy) = 0.
When these equations are added to each other we obtain a general diﬀer-
ential equation that arises from the given ﬁnite equation
Py2dy −aPx dy + Rx3dy + Ry3dy −3aRxy dy
+ Px2dx −aPy dx + Qx3dx + Qy3dx −3aQxy dx = 0.
287.
It is possible to ﬁnd an inﬁnite number of diﬀerential equations
through diﬀerentiation from the same ﬁnite equation, since before diﬀeren-
tiation the equation can be multiplied or divided by an arbitrary quantity.
Thus, if P is any function of x and y, so that dP = p dx + q dy, and if
the ﬁnite equation is multiplied by P and then diﬀerentiated, we obtain a
general diﬀerential equation that takes on an inﬁnite number of forms in-
sofar as P takes on one or another function. This multiplicity is increased
inﬁnitely if this equation is added to the original ﬁnite equation multiplied
by the formula Q dx+R dy, where Q and R can be any functions of x and y.
Although in all of these equations the relation between dy and dx remains,
and this is determined by the diﬀerential of the function y in the original
ﬁnite equation, nevertheless, the diﬀerential of y could be determined by
other ﬁnite equations. The reason for this is better explained in integral
calculus.
288.
Not only can we obtain an innumerable number of equations from
a single ﬁnite equation, but we can also ﬁnd an inﬁnite number of ﬁnite
equations that lead to the same diﬀerential equation. For instance, these

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
171
two equations y2 = ax + ab and y2 = ax are entirely diﬀerent, since in
the ﬁrst any constant quantity can be given to b. Nevertheless, when both
equations are diﬀerentiated, we obtain the same diﬀerential equation
2y dy = a dx.
Indeed, all of the equations represented by y2 = ax, depending on the value
assigned to a, correspond to a single diﬀerential equation that contains no
a. If this equation is divided by x, so that y2/x = a, then this, when
diﬀerentiated, gives
2x dy −y dx = 0.
Even both transcendental and algebraic equations can lead to the same
diﬀerential equation, as is seen in the equations
y2 −ax = 0
and
y2 −ax = b2ex/a.
If each of these equations is divided by ex/a, so that we have
e−x/a 
y2 −ax

= 0
and
e−x/a 
y2 −ax

= b2,
then when each of these is diﬀerentiated, the same diﬀerential equation
results:
2y dy −a dx −y2dx
a
+ x dx = 0.
289.
The reason for this diversity is the fact that the diﬀerential of a
constant quantity is equal to zero. Hence, if a ﬁnite equation can be reduced
to such a form that some constant quantity stands alone, neither multiplied
nor divided by variables, then by diﬀerentiation there arises an equation
in which that constant quantity is completely eliminated. In this way any
constant quantity involved in a ﬁnite equation can be eliminated through
diﬀerentiation. Thus, if the given equation is
x3 + y3 = 3axy,
and if this is divided by xy, so that we have
x3 + y3
xy
= 3a,
then when this equation is diﬀerentiated we have
2x3y dx + 2xy3dy −x4dy −y4dx = 0,
in which the constant no longer appears.

172
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
290.
If we need to remove several constant quantities from some ﬁnite
equation, we accomplish this through diﬀerentiating two or more times,
and in this way we ﬁnally obtain diﬀerential equations of higher orders in
which the constants have been completely removed. Let the given equation
be
y2 = ma2 −nx2,
from which we need to remove the constants ma2 and n. We remove the
ﬁrst by diﬀerentiation, to obtain
y dy + nx dx = 0.
From this we form the equation
y dy
x dx + n = 0.
When we take dx to be constant, through diﬀerentiation, we have
xy d2y + x dy2 −y dx dy = 0.
This equation, although it contains no constant, still results from every
equation that has the form y2 = ma2 −nx, no matter what values may be
assigned to the letters m, n, and a2.
291.
Not only constant quantities can be eliminated by diﬀerentiation
from ﬁnite equations, but also some variables, namely that variable whose
diﬀerential is assumed to be constant can be eliminated by diﬀerentiation.
Indeed, from a given equation in x and y, let us ﬁnd the value of x such
that x = Y , where Y is a function of y. Then dx = dY , and when dx is
taken to be constant, by diﬀerentiation we have 0 = d2Y . However, if
x2 + ax + b = Y,
then by three diﬀerentiations we have 0 = d3Y. By diﬀerentiation four times
the equation
x3 + ax2 + bx + c = Y
gives 0 = d4Y . In all of these equations, although only one variable seems
to be present, while another variable can be missing from the equation,
still, since the diﬀerential dx is assumed to be constant, we must in reality
remember that there is some relationship to x and consider x as belonging
to the equation. Hence it should cause no surprise if frequently diﬀerential
equations of second or higher order occur in which only one variable seems
to be involved.

9. On Diﬀerential Equations

292.
It is particularly important to notice that irrational and transcen-
dental quantities can be eliminated from an equation by diﬀerentiation.
With regard to irrationals, by known methods of reduction irrationals can
be eliminated, and once this is accomplished, by diﬀerentiation we obtain
an equation free of any irrationality. However, frequently it can be more
convenient without the reduction to remove the irrationality by comparing
the diﬀerential equation with the ﬁnite formula, provided that there is only
one irrational quantity. If there are two or more irrational parts in the ﬁ-
nite equation, then the diﬀerential equation is diﬀerentiated again as many
times as there are individual irrational parts to be eliminated, and hence
the diﬀerential equation will be of a higher order. In this way arbitrary
exponents and fractional exponents can also be eliminated. For example, if
ym =

a2 −x2n ,
then after diﬀerentiation we have
mym−1dy = −2n

a2 −x2n−1 x dx.
When this equation is divided by the ﬁnite equation we have
m dy
y
= −2nx dx
a2 −x2 ,
in which there remains no arbitrary exponent. It should be clear that a
diﬀerential equation that is free of all irrationality can arise from a ﬁnite
equation that involves an irrationality or even a transcendental quantity.
293.
In order that we understand the way in which transcendental quan-
tities are eliminated by diﬀerentiation we begin with logarithms. Since the
diﬀerential of a logarithm is algebraic, this operation causes no diﬃculty.
Thus, if
y = x ln x,
then y/x = ln x, and by diﬀerentiation we have
x dy −y dx
x2
= dx
x ,
so that
x dy −y dx = x dx.
If there are two logarithms, then two diﬀerentiations are required. If
y ln x = x ln y,
then
y ln x
x
= ln y,

174
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
and by diﬀerentiation,
x dy ln x + y dx −y dx ln x
x2
= dy
y .
We conclude that
ln x = x2dy −y2dx
yx dy −y2dx.
When this equation is diﬀerentiated, with dx set constant, we have

Exponential quantities are removed by diﬀerentiation in the same
way as logarithms. If the given equation is
P = eQ,
where P and Q are any functions of x and y, the equation can be trans-
formed into the logarithmic equation ln P = Q, whose diﬀerential is
dP
P = Q,
or
dP = P dQ.
There is no real diﬃculty if the exponential quantities are more compli-
cated. In this case, if one diﬀerentiation is not suﬃcient, then two or more
diﬀerentiations will solve the problem.

In a similar way trigonometric quantities can be removed from an
equation by diﬀerentiation, as can be understood from the following exam-
ples.

a.
Then
dy =

or
x2dy = (y dx −x dy)

a2 −y2.
III. Let y = m sin x + n cos x. After the ﬁrst diﬀerentiation we have dy =
m dx cos x −n dx sin x. When we keep dx constant and diﬀerentiate
again the result is d2y = −m dx2 sin x −n dx2 cos x. When this equa-
tion is divided by the given one we have d2y/y = −dx2, or
d2y + y dx2 = 0,
from which not only the sine and cosine have been eliminated, but
also the constants m and n.
IV. Let y = sin ln x. Then arcsin y = ln x, and by diﬀerentiation we have
dy

1 −y2 = dx
x .
When each side is squared, the result is x2dy2 = dx2−y2dx2. When we
let dx be constant, by another diﬀerentiation we obtain 2x2dy d2y +
2x dx dy2 = −2y dx2dy, or
x2d2y + x dx dy + y dx2 = 0.
V. Let y = aemx sin nx. Then by diﬀerentiation,
dy = maemxdx sin nx + naemxdx cos nx.
When this is divided by the given equation we have

or


y2dx2 −2my dx dy = −y d2y.
It should be clear that although the diﬀerential equation may contain no
transcendental quantity, still the ﬁnite equation from which it originated
may contain transcendental quantities of various kinds.
296. Therefore, diﬀerential equations, whether of the ﬁrst or higher order,
which contain two variables, x and y, arise from ﬁnite equations that also
express a relationship between the two variables. Indeed, given any diﬀer-
ential equation containing these two variables x and y, there is expressed
a relationship between x and y such that y becomes a function of x. From
this we can see the nature of a diﬀerential equation. That is, if we can as-
sign to y a function of x that is indicated by the equation and is such that
when the function is substituted for y its diﬀerential is substituted for dy,
and its higher diﬀerentials for d2y, d3y, etc., then the resulting equation
is an identity. Integral calculus is concerned with the investigation of such
functions. It has this purpose, that given any diﬀerential equation, a func-
tion of x should be deﬁned that is equal to the other variable y, or what
is equivalent, that a ﬁnite equation be found that contains the relationship
between x and y.
297.
If, for example, the given equation is
2y dy −a dx −y2dx
a
+ x dx = 0,
1This is a correction by Gerhard Kowalewski. The original edition had
n dx =
n dx dy2 −ny dx d2y
m2y2dx2 + n2y2dx2 −2my dx dy .

178
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
which we arrived at above in paragraph 288, the same relationship between
x and y is deﬁned as that contained in the ﬁnite equation
y2 −ax = b2ex/a.
From this we have y2 = ax + b2ex/a, so that

ax + b2ex/a = y,
which is the function of x that y equals in the given diﬀerential equation.
Indeed, if we substitute the value ax + b2ex/a for y2 and if we substitute
its diﬀerential
a dx + b2
a ex/adx
for 2y dy, we obtain the following identity:
a dx + b2
a ex/adx −a dx −x dx −b2
a ex/adx + x dx = 0.
Hence it is clear that every diﬀerential equation exhibits the same relation-
ship between x and y as a certain ﬁnite relationship, which we can ﬁnd
only with the aid of integral calculus.
298.
In order that this may be understood more clearly, we suppose that
we know the function of x that is equal to y by reason of the diﬀerential
equation, whether of the ﬁrst order or of higher order. We also let
dy = p dx,
dp = q dx,
dq = r dx,
etc., and if in the equation we take dx to be constant, then d2y = q dx2,
d3y = r dx3, etc. When these values are substituted into the diﬀerential
equation, due to the homogeneous terms, there remains an equation con-
taining only ﬁnite quantities x, y, p, q, r, etc. Since p, q, r, etc. are quantities
that naturally depend on the function y, there really remains an equation
between two variables x and y. In turn it should be clear that a certain
relationship between the variables x and y is determined by every diﬀeren-
tial equation. For this reason, if in the solution of some problem we obtain
a diﬀerential equation between x and y, we can consider this to be equiv-
alent to a relationship between x and y, just as if we had come to a ﬁnite
equation.
299. In this way any diﬀerential equation can be reduced to ﬁnite form, so
that it contains nothing but ﬁnite quantities when the diﬀerentials, that is,
the inﬁnitely small quantities, are removed. Since y is some certain function
of x, if we let dy = p dx, dp = q dx, dq = r dx, etc., when some diﬀerential
is taken to be constant, the second and higher diﬀerentials are expressed

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
179
through powers of dx and then completely removed through division. For
example, if the given equation is
xy d3y + x2dy d2y + y2dx d2y −xy dx3 = 0,
in which dx is taken as constant, we let dy = p dx, dp = q dx, and dq = r dx,
so that the equation becomes
xyr + x2pq + y2q −xy = 0.
After the whole equation is divided by dx3, this ﬁnite equation determines
the relationship between x and y.
300.
Every diﬀerential equation, no matter of what order, by means of
the substitutions
dy = p dx,
dp = q dx,
dq = r dx,
etc., can be reduced to ﬁnite quantities. Indeed, if the diﬀerential equation
is of the ﬁrst order, so that it contains only the ﬁrst diﬀerential, by means
of this reduction, besides y and x, the quantity p is also introduced. If the
diﬀerential equation is of the second order, containing a second diﬀerential,
then also the quantity q is introduced; if it be of the third order, then we
also have r; and so forth. Since the diﬀerentials are eliminated from the
calculation in this way, the question about a constant diﬀerential has not
gone away. Even though we have the quantities q and r arising from second
diﬀerentials we still have to indicate whether some diﬀerential is taken to
be constant. It comes to this, whether or not in the development some
diﬀerential has been arbitrarily taken to be constant.
301. If some diﬀerential equation of second or higher order is given, and no
constant ﬁrst diﬀerential is indicated, we can explore in the following way
whether or not there is a determined relationship between the variables
x and y. Since no diﬀerential is assumed to be constant, we are free to
choose whatever diﬀerential we want to be constant. By choosing diﬀerent
diﬀerentials to be constant we see whether the same relationship between
x and y is given. If this does not happen, then it is a certain sign that the
equation expresses no determined relationship, and therefore can have no
place in the solution of a problem. However, the safest method, and also
the easiest, to explore this question is that given above in paragraph 277.
There, in a similar question, we gave a test for determining whether or not
diﬀerential expressions of higher order have a ﬁxed signiﬁcation.
302.
Hence, given a diﬀerential equation of second or higher order, with
no diﬀerential set constant, we let dx be constant. Then, as we have shown
above in paragraph 276 for diﬀerential expressions, this equation will be
reduced to the same form, which supposes that no diﬀerential is constant.

180
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
That is, we substitute
d2y −dy d2x
dx
for d2y, and
d3y −3d2x d2y
dx
+ 3dy d2x2
dx2
−dy d3x
dx
for d3y, etc. When this is done it becomes clear whether the resulting
equation is the same as the given equation. If this is the case, the given
equation gives a determined relationship between x and y, just as we have
shown at length.
303. In order that this become perfectly clear let us take a given equation
in which no constant diﬀerential seems to be given:
P d2x + Q d2y + R dx2 + S dx dy + T dy2 = 0.
When we let dx be constant, the equation becomes
Q d2y + R dx2 + S dx dy + T d2 = 0.
From this now, the consideration of a constant diﬀerential is removed in
the previously prescribed manner, to obtain
−Q dy d2x
dx
+ Q d2y + R dx2 + S dx dy + T dy2 = 0.
Since this equation diﬀers from the original only in the ﬁrst term, we must
see whether P = −Q dy/dx. If this is the case, we conclude that the given
equation exhibits a ﬁxed relationship between x and y, which can be found
by the rules of integral calculus, whichever diﬀerential is taken to be con-
stant. However, if it is not true that P = −Q dy/dx, then the given equation
is impossible.
304.
It follows that unless the given equation
P d2x + Q d2y + R dx2 + S dx dy + T dy2 = 0
is meaningless, it is necessary that P dx + Q dy = 0. This can happen in
two ways. First, the equation
P = −Q dy
dx ,
or
P dx + Q dy = 0,
is an identical equation. Second, the equation P dx + Q dy = 0 is itself a
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation whose diﬀerentiation gave rise to the given
equation. In the second case, the equation P dx + Q dy = 0 corresponds to
the given equation and contains the same relationship between x and y. For

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
181
this reason the solution can be found without the aid of integral calculus.
Indeed, when P dx + Q dy = 0 is diﬀerentiated, we obtain
P d2x + Q d2y + dP dx + dQ dy = 0,
and when this is subtracted from the given equation, there remains
R dx2 + S dx dy + T dy2 = dP dx + dQ dy.
Since dy = −P dx/Q, the diﬀerentials can be completely eliminated to
indicate the relationship between x and y.
305. Let us suppose that in the solution of some problem we arrive at the
equation
x3d2x + x2y d2y −y2dx2 + x2dy2 + a2dx2 = 0
and that there is no assumption about a constant diﬀerential. Since it is
clear that the equation is not absurd, it follows that x3dx + x2y dy = 0 or
x dx + y dy = 0, whose diﬀerential is
x3d2x + x2y d2y + 3x2dx2 + 2xy dx dy + x2dy2 = 0.
When this equation is subtracted from the given equation, there remains
a2dx2 −y2dx2 −3x2dx2 −2xy dx dy = 0,
or
a2dx −y2dx −3x2dx −2xy dy = 0.
Since x dx + y dy = 0, we have
2xy dy = −2x2dx,
so that a2dx−y2dx−x2dx = 0, or y2+x2 = a2. Now this equation expresses
a true relationship between x and y, and it agrees with the diﬀerential
x dx + y dy = 0, which we found before. This agreement follows unless
it were manifestly clear that the given equation were impossible. Since in
this case that is not true, it is valid to ﬁnd x2 + y2 = a2 without integral
calculus.
306. For the sake of an example of an impossible equation, let us consider
y2d2x −x2d2y + y dx2 −x dy2 + a dx dy = 0,
in which no constant diﬀerential is assumed. Then we would have y2dx −
x2dy = 0. When this is diﬀerentiated, we have
y2d2x −x2d2y + 2y dx dy −2x dx dy = 0.

182
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
This together with the proposed equation gives
y dx2 −x dy2 + a dx dy = 2y dx dy −2x dx dy.
However, since dy = y2dx/x2, when the diﬀerentials are eliminated, we
obtain
y −y4
x3 + ay2
x2 = 2y3
x2 −2y2
x ,
or
x3 −y3 + axy = 2xy2 −2x2y.
Now, whether this is consistent with the diﬀerential y2dx −x2dy = 0 be-
comes clear when it is diﬀerentiated; that is,
3x2dx −3y2dy + ax dy + ay dx = 2y2dx + 4xy dy −2x2dy −4xy dx,
or
dy
dx = 3x2 + ay −2y2 + 4xy
3y2 −ax + 4xy −2x2 .
But since
dy
dx = y2
x2 ,
we have
3x4 + 4x3y + ax2y = 3y4 + 4xy3 −axy2,
or
axy = 3y4 + 4xy3 −4x3y −3x4
x + y
= 3y3 + xy2 −x2y −3x3.
From the ﬁnite equation already obtained, we have
axy = y3 + 2xy2 −2x2y −x3,
and when this is subtracted from the previous equation there remains
0 = 2y3 −xy2 + x2y −2x3,
which factors into 0 = y −x and 2y2 +xy +2x2 = 0. Of these, the equation
y = x can be consistent with dy = y2dx/x2, but it does not satisfy the ﬁnite
equation previously found. Unless we let a = 0, or unless both variables x
and y are set constant so that dx = 0 and dy = 0 and all of the diﬀerential
equations are satisﬁed, the given equation cannot hold.

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
183
307. Now let us consider diﬀerential equations involving three variables x,
y, and z that are of the ﬁrst, second, or higher order. In order to investigate
the nature of these we ought to note that a ﬁnite equation composed of
three variables determines a relationship that one of them has to the other
two. Hence, there is deﬁned the kind of function that z is of x and y. A ﬁnite
equation of this kind can be a solution insofar as it is clear what kind of a
function of x and y is to be substituted for z in order to satisfy the equation.
Likewise, a diﬀerential equation involving three variables determines what
kind of function one of the variables is of the others. Hence an equation
of this kind should be thought of as having been solved when the function
of two variables x and y is given that when substituted for z satisﬁes the
equation or renders it an identity. Thus a diﬀerential equation is solved if
either a function z of x and y is deﬁned or a ﬁnite equation is given by
means of which the value of this same z is expressed.
308.
Although every diﬀerential equation containing only two variables
always expresses a determined relationship between them, nevertheless this
is not always the case in diﬀerential equations in three variables. There exist
equations of this kind in which it is clear that there is no possibility that
some function of x and y can be substituted for z to satisfy the equation.
Indeed, if the given equation is
z dy = y dx,
it is easily seen that absolutely no function of x and y can be given that
when substituted for z makes z dy = y dx. The diﬀerentials dx and dy
cannot simply vanish. In a similar way it is clear that there is no function
of x and z that when substituted for y will satisfy that same equation. No
matter what function of x and z might be devised for y, its diﬀerential dy
contains dz, but this cannot be eliminated, since it is not in the equation.
For these reasons there is no ﬁnite equation in x, y, and z that satisﬁes the
diﬀerential equation z dy = y dx.
309.
Hence we must distinguish among diﬀerential equations in three
variables those that are imaginary and those that are real. An equation of
this kind will be imaginary or absurd if there is no ﬁnite equation that could
satisfy it. Such an equation is z dy = y dx, which we have just considered.
An equation will be real if an equivalent ﬁnite equation can be exhibited
in which one variable is equal to a certain function of the other two. The
following equation is such an example:
z dy + y dz = x dz + z dx + x dy + y dx.
This ﬁts with the ﬁnite equation yz = xz + xy, so that
z =
xy
y −x.

184
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
We must very carefully separate these kinds of equations into imaginary
and real, especially in integral calculus, since it would be ridiculous to seek
an integral for a diﬀerential equation, that is, a ﬁnite equation that it would
satisfy, when it is clear that none exists.
310.
In the ﬁrst place, then, it is clear that every diﬀerential equation
with three variables in which only two diﬀerentials occur is imaginary and
absurd. Let us consider an equation that contains the variable z but only
the diﬀerentials dx and dy, the diﬀerential dz being completely absent.
It is obvious that no function of x and y can be exhibited that can be
substituted for z to produce an identical equation. Indeed, the diﬀerentials
dx and dy can in no way be removed. In these cases there is absolutely
no satisfactory ﬁnite equation, unless perhaps it is possible to assign a
relationship between x and y that persists no matter what z might be. For
example, in the equation
z dy −z dx = y dy −x dx,
which is satisﬁed by y = x. It is easy to investigate the cases in which this
happens by looking for a relationship between x and y, ﬁrst when z = 0,
and then whether the same relationship persists when z has an arbitrary
value.
311.
Nor is it the case that an equation is absurd only if it involves three
variables and two diﬀerentials. It can be absurd even if all three diﬀerentials
are present. In order to show this let P and Q be functions of only x and
y and consider the equation
dz = P dx + Q dy.
If this equation is not to be absurd, then z is some function of x and y whose
diﬀerential is dz = p dx + q dy so that P = p and Q = q. However, we have
demonstrated (paragraph 232) that p dx + q dy cannot be the diﬀerential
of any function of x and y unless
∂p
∂y = ∂q
∂x.
Here the notation means, as we previously assumed, that ∂p/∂y is the
diﬀerential of p with only y variable, divided by dy, and ∂q/∂x is the
diﬀerential of q, with only x variable, divided by dx. Hence, the equation
dz = P dx + Q dy cannot be real unless
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x .
312.
Absolutely the same reasoning applies to the equation
dZ = P dx + Q dy,

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
185
if Z denotes any function of z, while P and Q are functions of x and y
without involving z. In order that Z might be a function of x and y, it is
necessary that
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x .
According to this criterion, any proposed diﬀerential equation given in this
general form can be judged to be either real or absurd. Hence, it is clear
that the equation z dz = y dx + x dy is real. Since P = y and Q = x, we
have
∂P
∂y = 1 = ∂Q
∂x = 1.
However, the equation az dz = y2dx + x2dy is absurd, since
∂P
∂y = 2y
and
∂Q
∂x = 2x.
But these are not equal.
313.
In order to investigate this criterion more completely, let P, Q, and
R be functions of x, y, and z. Every diﬀerential equation in three variables,
provided that it is of the ﬁrst order, is of the form
P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0.
Whenever this equation is real, z will be equal to some function of x and
y. Furthermore, its diﬀerential will have the form dz = p dx + q dy. Hence,
if in the given equation this function of x and y is substituted for z and
if p dx + q dy is substituted for dz, then of necessity, the result will be an
identical equation 0 = 0. Since from the given equation we have
dz = −P dx
R
−Q dy
R ,
if in P, Q, and R, this function is substituted for z, then necessarily we
have
p = −P
R
and
q = −Q
R.
314.
Since dz = p dx + q dy, from a previous demonstration we have
∂p
∂y = ∂q
∂x.
Hence, when the function in x and y is substituted for z, we have p = −P/R
and q = −Q/R, so that
∂p
∂y = −R∂P + P∂R
R2∂y
and
∂q
∂x = −R∂Q + Q∂R
R2∂x
.

186
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
It follows that when we multiply by R2, we obtain
P ∂R
∂y −R∂P
∂y = Q∂R
∂x −R∂Q
∂x ,
where the denominators ∂y and ∂x indicate that in the diﬀerentials of the
numerators, only that quantity that appears in the denominator is assumed
to be variable. However, these diﬀerentials ∂P, ∂Q, and ∂R cannot be
known until the proper value is substituted for z; since this is not known,
we proceed in the following way.
315.
Since P, Q, and R are functions of x, y, and z, we let
dP = αdx + βdy + γdz,
dQ = δdx + ϵdy + ζdz,
dR = ηdx + θdy + ιdz,
where α, β, γ, ϵ, and so forth, denote those functions that arise from diﬀer-
entiation. Now let us consider the substitution everywhere for z the func-
tion in x and y that is equal to z, and for dz we substitute the expression
p dx + q dy and thus obtain
dP = (α + γp) dx + (β + γq) dy,
dQ = (δ + ζp) dx + (ϵ + ζq) dy,
dR = (η + ιp) dx + (θ + ιq) dy.
From these equations we obtain
∂R
∂y = θ + ιq,
∂R
∂x = η + ιp,
∂P
∂y = β + γq,
∂Q
∂x = δ + ζp.
316.
Since the reality of the equation requires that
P ∂R
∂y −R∂P
∂y = Q∂R
∂x −R∂Q
∂x ,
the result is that when we substitute the values just found, we obtain
P (θ + ιq) −R (β + γq) = Q (η + ιp) −R (δ + ζp) .
However, we have already seen that p = −P/R and q = −Q/R. But these
values can be obtained, even if the function in x and y is not substituted for

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
187
z, since the diﬀerentials are no longer required in the computation. Hence
we have
Pθ −PQι
R
−Rβ + Qγ = Qη −PQι
R
−Rδ + Pζ,
or
0 = P (ζ −θ) + Q (η −γ) + R (β −δ) .
Since the quantities β, δ, γ, η, ζ, θ, were found by diﬀerentiation, when we
use the notation given previously, we have
0 = P
∂Q
∂z −∂R
∂y

+ Q
∂R
∂x −∂P
∂z

+ R
∂P
∂y −∂Q


.
Unless this condition is met, the original equation is not real, but imaginary
and absurd.
317.
Although we have discovered this rule from a consideration of the
variable z, still, since all of the variables enter in equally, it is clear that
from a consideration of the other variables, the same expression will re-
sult. Hence, if a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation involving three variables is
proposed, we can determine immediately whether it is real or imaginary.
Indeed, it can be put into the general form
P dx + Q dy + R dz
and then we investigate the value of the formula
P

∂z −∂R
∂y

+ Q
∂R
∂x −∂P
∂z

+ R
∂P

∂x

.
If this is equal to zero, then the equation is real; if it is not equal to zero,
then the equation is imaginary or absurd.
318.
A given equation can always be reduced by division to the form
P dx + Q dy + dz = 0.
If R = 1, the previous criterion becomes simpler:
P ∂Q
∂z −Q∂P
∂z + ∂P
∂y −∂Q
∂x = 0.
Whenever this expression is really equal to zero, the given equation is real;
if the contrary is true, then the equation is imaginary. After all of this has
been demonstrated, it is certain. However, a priori, it could be doubted
whether an equation is always real whenever this criterion so indicated.
Since at this time we cannot demonstrate this completely, nevertheless in

188
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
integral calculus this can be conﬁrmed. At this time we simply aﬃrm that
this is true and that no one should fear any danger from this, even if in the
meantime someone wishes to entertain some doubt about its truth.
319. From this criterion, in the ﬁrst place, it is clear that if in the equation
P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0
P is a function only of x, Q is a function only of y, and R is a function
only of z, then the equation will always be real. Indeed, since
∂P
∂y = 0,
∂P
∂z = 0,
∂Q
∂z = 0,
∂Q
∂x = 0,
∂R
∂x = 0,
∂R
∂y = 0,
the whole expression vanishes spontaneously.
320.
If, as before, P is a function of x and Q is a function of y, but only
R is a function of x, y, and z, then the equation will we real if
P ∂R
∂y = Q∂R
∂x ,
or
∂R
∂x
∂R
∂y = P
Q.
For example, if the given equation is
2dx
x
+ 3dy
y
+ x2y3dz
z6
= 0,
since here
P = 2
x,
Q = 3
y ,
R = x2y3
z6 ,
we have
∂R
∂x = 2xy3
z6
and
∂R
∂y = 3x2y2
z6
,
and so
P ∂R
∂y = Q∂R
∂x = 6xy2
z6 .
It follows that the given equation is real.
321. If P and Q are functions of x and y, while R is a function of z alone,
since
∂P
∂z = 0,
∂Q
∂z = 0,
∂R
∂x = 0,
∂R
∂y = 0,
the equation will be real, provided that
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x .

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
189
This same condition is required if P dx+Q dy is to be a determined diﬀeren-
tial, that is, one that arises from the diﬀerentiation of some ﬁnite function
of x and y. This brings us back to what we have previously observed in
paragraph 312, that the equation dZ = P dx + Q dy with Z a function of z
alone, while P and Q are functions of x and y, can be real only if
∂P
∂y = ∂Q
∂x .
Both of these cases are interrelated, since if R is a function of z alone we
can substitute dZ for R dz, where Z is a function of z.
322. In order to illustrate this criterion let us consider the following equa-
tion:

6xy2z −5yz3
dx +

5x2yz −4xz3
dy +

4x2y2 −6xyz2
dz = 0.
When this is compared to the general form, we obtain
P = 6xy2z −5yz3,
∂P
∂y = 12xyz −5z3,
∂P
∂z = 6xy2 −15yz2,
Q = 5x2yz −4xz3,
∂Q
∂x = 10xyz −4z3,
∂Q
∂z = 5x2y −12xz2,
R = 4x2y2 −6xyz2,
∂R
∂x = 8xy2 −6yz2,
∂R
∂y = 8x2y −6xz2.
With these values discovered, the equation giving the solution is

6xy2z −5yz3 


5x2yz −4xz3 
2xy2 + 9yz2

2xyz −z3
= 0.
But when this expression is simpliﬁed, each term is negated by another, so
that 0 = 0, which indicates that the given equation is real.
323.
When the expression obtained in this way from the criterion fails to
vanish, this is a sign that the given equation is imaginary. However, when
a ﬁnite equation is found in this way from the criterion, provided that
it is consistent with the diﬀerential equation, it indicates the relationship
that the variables have to each other. Furthermore, this is the way in which
those cases arise that we recall from paragraph 310. Suppose that the given
equation is
(z −x) dx + (y −z) dy = 0.

190
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
Then
P = z −x,
Q = y −z,
and
R = 0,
but
∂P
∂z = 1
and
∂Q
∂z = −1.
The deciding equation becomes
P ∂Q
∂z = Q∂P
∂z ,
or
z −x = z −y,
so that
y = x.
Since in this case it turns out that y = x also satisﬁes the diﬀerential
equation, we have to say that the given diﬀerential equation has no other
signiﬁcance than y = x.
324.
Hence, when a diﬀerential equation containing three variables is
given,
P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0,
there are the three following cases that must be considered concerning the
equation which results:
P
∂Q
∂z −∂R
∂y

+ Q
∂R
∂x −∂P
∂z

+ R
∂P
∂y −∂Q
∂x

= 0.
The ﬁrst case occurs if this expression is really equal to zero, and then the
given equation is real. However, if this ﬁnite equation is not an identity,
then it must be decided whether it satisﬁes the given equation. If this
happens, we have a ﬁnite equation, and this is the second case. The third
case occurs if the ﬁnite equation does not agree with the given diﬀerential
equation, and then the given equation is imaginary. In this case no ﬁnite
equation can be found that satisﬁes the given equation.
325.
The ﬁrst and third cases are self-evident. The second, however, al-
though quite rare, deserves special consideration. Since the example already
considered contains only two diﬀerentials, we will give another equation,
which has all three diﬀerentials:
(z −y) dx + x dy + (y −z) dz = 0.

9. On Diﬀerential Equations
191
Here we have
P = z −y,
∂Q
∂z = 0,
∂R
∂y = 1,
Q = x,
∂R
∂x = 0,
∂P
∂z = 1,
R = y −z,
∂P
∂y = −1,
∂Q
∂x = 1,
so that the ﬁnite equation resulting from the criterion is z −x −y = 0, or
z = x + y. When this value for z is substituted in the diﬀerential equation
we have
x dx + x dy −x (dx + dy) = 0.
Since this equation is an identity, it follows that the diﬀerential equation
signiﬁes nothing but z = x + y.
326.
Since we have said that all ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations contain-
ing three variables are of the form
P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0,
some question may arise concerning those equations in which the ﬁrst dif-
ferentials are raised to the second or higher power. For example,
P dx2 + Q dy2 + R dz2 = 2S dx dy + 2T dx dz + 2V dy dz.
It should be noted about equations of this kind that they could not possibly
be real unless they have divisors of the previous form that make up simple
equations. Since from the given equation we have
dz = T dx + V dy
R
±

dx2 (T 2 −PR) + 2dx dy (TV + RS) + dy2 (V 2 −QR)
R
,
it is clear that z cannot be a function or x and y, nor does dz have the
form p dx + q dy unless the irrational expression turns out to be rational.
This happens if

T 2 −PR

V 2 −QR

= (TV + RS)2 ,
or
R = PV 2 + 2STV + QT 2
PQ −S2
.

192
9. On Diﬀerential Equations
Hence unless this ﬁnite equation is satisﬁed, the given equation will be
imaginary.
327. We might have treated in this chapter diﬀerential equations of higher
order that contain three variables, and we might have considered and de-
cided which of these turn out to be either real or imaginary. However, since
the criteria become extremely intricate, we omit this work, especially since
this follows from the same sources which we have here explored. Indeed, if
there is need for these criteria in integral calculus, at that stage they can
easily be developed. For the same reason we have not at this time consid-
ered equations with more variables, especially since they practically never
occur. If it is ever necessary, there should be no diﬃculty in examining such
equations with the principles we have discussed here. For these reasons we
here bring to a conclusion our exposition of the principles of diﬀerential cal-
culus. We next move on to show some of the more important applications
that this calculus has both in analysis and in higher geometry.
