About the Author
Jacqueline O’Neil is an award-winning author of more than a dozen
books and a couple hundred magazine articles on animal care and
training. She and her husband, Tom, a wildlife photographer, follow
the sun around North America in a motor home. Favorite stops

Before morphing into a Gypsy, Jackie was a successful dog breeder
and trainer, handling her own dogs to top awards in the show and
obedience rings.
A graduate of the University of Florida, Jackie is a member of the
Outdoor Writers Association of America, the National League of
American Pen Women, and the Dog Writers Association of America,
where she also served two terms as a director. In addition to dogs,
she’s into horses, birds, fishing, scuba diving, and fiddling.
Jackie has two grown daughters, Peggy and Sunny Fraser, who have
recently started their own menageries. The whole family is proud to
be owned by a Chihuahua named Manchita.


Dedication
To my daughters, Peggy and Sunny Fraser, who served as mommies
to a munchkin named Manchita, including their college and early
career years.
Author’s Acknowledgments
My husband, Tom O’Neil, took some of the photos for this book and
proofread the manuscript before I sent it to my editors.
My mother, Dori Freedman, taught me that anything worth doing is
worth doing right, and that once started, projects must be finished.
Perhaps that’s why I’ve been able to make writing my career.
My stepdad, Needham Parrish, contributed to the research in a big
way by sending me books, articles, and videos on Chihuahuas. He
also took the photos of the Chihuahua named Chiquita.
My daughter, Peggy Fraser, who hates posing for pictures, did it
anyway. Thanks, honey.
Taco Bell Corp. provided information about Gidget, the world’s
most recognizable Chihuahua, and included photos of its superstar.

Chihuahuas For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
Years ago, the then editor of the AKC Gazette asked me to
cover the Chihuahua National Specialty, the breed’s most
prestigious annual dog show. The article I wrote was entitled,
“Chihuahuas Charm Chicago,” but the truth is, those Chihuahuas
charmed me. Although I bred and exhibited American Staffordshire
Terriers and was a veteran writer — in other words, I was used to
studying a breed, attending national specialty shows, and submit-
ting articles — I was smitten with Chihuahuas. I fell as surely as a
young girl whose first date brings her flowers. From that day on, I
had to have a Chihuahua.
From singles on the fast track to business success to seniors out
seeing the world, many of my friends and acquaintances share
their lives with Chihuahuas. And do you know what? Every single
one of us had our first Chihuahua years before television commer-
cials boosted the breed’s popularity.
Today you can’t turn on the TV or browse in a gift shop without
seeing Chihuahuas. From fashion centers to flea markets, they’ve
become one of the nation’s most popular pets. But just because
these critters attract attention with their incredible cuteness isn’t
enough reason to run out and get one. You wouldn’t ask the pretti-
est cheerleader or the best football player to marry you when you
don’t even know her or his name, would you? Instead, let me intro-
duce you to the Chihuahua with this book.
A little guidance — that’s what I’m here for. So, turn to Chapter 1,
or anywhere in the book for that matter, and let me do my job!
Whether you’re a potential new owner or have enjoyed the com-
panionship of Chihuahuas for years, this book can help you and
your dog make the most of your relationship.
About This Book
Chihuahuas For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is designed to be a complete
reference guide. I tell you everything you need to know about select-
ing, raising, and training a healthy, well-mannered Chihuahua. And
although I promote prevention — not only in health matters but also
by proposing positive training methods right from the start — I
explain how to correct the bad habits your dog may have already
picked up. 

Chihuahuas For Dummies, 2nd Edition
2
But wait. Maybe you don’t have a dog yet and you’re reading this
book because you wonder if a Chihuahua is the breed for you. 
Well, you’ve come to the right place! This book covers the unique
Chihuahua personality and gives honest answers about both the
pleasures and problems of living with a Chihuahua. Ohmygosh!
What if you read those sections and then decide a Chihuahua isn’t
your dream dog after all? In that case, I just saved you a bundle of
money and years of enduring a match that wasn’t made in heaven.
It’s important to think about how your personality will blend with
the unique disposition of this diminutive breed.
I wrote this book to make living with a Chihuahua easy and fun.
Whether you have one Chi or half a dozen, this book simplifies daily
care, tells you how to train your dog, and even helps you organize a
nonviolent coup to take leadership away from a tiny tyrant!
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book even easier to understand, I included a few 
conventions:
 Italic text indicates new words or terms that I define. I also use
it for emphasis (I get excited!).
 Boldfaced type helps you remember the most important
points when reading bulleted lists or numbered steps.
 I use monofont to set apart Web sites and e-mail addresses.
 Occasionally, I write “Chi” instead of spelling out “Chihuahua.”
I do this to make for faster reading, not because it’s a nick-
name for the breed. It isn’t.
Because my degree is in English, I know that the proper way to 
refer to an animal is “it,” but I can’t stand “it” when talking about a
member of a family. So, I get around this by using gender references.
In some chapters I discuss all Chis as if they’re males, and in some
chapters it’s ladies’ night. And occasionally, I’ll name the Chihuahuas
I talk about for fun. In some of the chapters, the Chihuahua is named
Pepe, and in the others, the Chi is named Manchita.
What You’re Not to Read
Although this book is brimming with essential info, it also contains
some Chihuahua trivia, a few just-for-fun dog facts, and some tech-
nical stuff you don’t really need to know but that may make for
good conversation. In case you’re in a hurry to find out what you
do need to know, feel free to skip the following:

 Text in sidebars: The shaded boxes are sidebars, and
although they’re good reads, the info in them isn’t essential.
 Paragraphs highlighted with a Technical Stuff icon: Yes,
these icons precede good info, but you don’t need to know 
it to be an ideal Chihuahua owner. The icon also points out
really short true stories and Chihuahua trivia.
Foolish Assumptions
Before writing this book, I had to think about who I was writing it
for, so I made some assumptions about you, my dear reader, and
the type of book you need. Here they are; am I close?
 You like dogs in general, and the Chihuahua is one of the
breeds you like in particular. You’re thinking about making
one a part of your family. But first you want to know more
about the breed, the pros and cons of living with a Chihuahua,
and how to select your ideal dog.
 You’ve already taken the plunge. Your Chihuahua puppy is
coming home soon and you want to know what he needs right
away and how to take care of him.
 Your Chihuahua puppy is home, but doggonit she wakes 
you up during the night and can’t seem to get the hang of
housetraining.
 Your Chihuahua is an adult. You want to read this book in
your comfy recliner, but that darn dog claimed it. Lately, he
growls and nips whenever anyone tries to sit in it. And don’t
even think about touching his food dish! Perhaps you want to
know how to handle a stubborn Chi in his senior years!
 Your Chihuahua is well behaved and super smart. Everyone
agrees that he’s special, and now you want him to try obedi-
ence, agility, or maybe a dog show. Or perhaps you’re consid-
ering training him to be a therapy dog.
 You don’t have and don’t want a Chihuahua, but your cousin
just got one and her birthday is coming up!
How This Book Is Organized
Chihuahuas For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is divided into five sections,
and each one covers an essential topic. If you’re looking for a
Chihuahua, you may want to begin in the early chapters. If you
already have a Chi, you can skip around, going quickly in and out
of chapters that address your curiosity or urgent needs. Either
way, here’s what you find.
Introduction

Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your 
Canine Compadre? 
Adopting a dog has a lot in common with adopting a soul mate of
the human species: You know you’re in for a lot of give and take! But
don’t let that scare you — bringing a Chihuahua into your life is both
a serious commitment and one of life’s huge pleasures. This section
helps you make good decisions and shows you what’s in store.
Part II: Fitting a Compact 
Canine into Your Life 
What do you look for in a healthy Chihuahua? How do you prepare
your home for your little amigo? What do Chihuahuas eat? How
much exercise do they need? Part II provides the information you
need to welcome a Chi into your household and have a good begin-
ning to a special new relationship.
Part III: Positive Training 
for Your Petite Pal 
Part III is your ready reference guide and everyday problem solver.
Here I tell you how to raise a mannerly puppy and instill good habits
in an adult dog. Housebreaking? Barking? Shyness? Dominance? I
cover all the typical Chihuahua problems and their solutions here. I
discuss plenty of fun, too. I include tricks Chihuahuas love to learn
and a lot of info on dog shows and other activities you and your dog
can enjoy together.
Part IV: Chihuahua 
Care and Concerns 
Finding the right veterinarian for your dog — at a convenient 
location — is job one of the health plan. Part IV shows you how to
find a good vet and make the most of your visits to the clinic. You
also find out how to care for a senior Chihuahua and how to handle
emergency illnesses and injuries. Basically, you use this section as
a reference for identifying and dealing with common health needs
of Chihuahuas.

Part V: The Part of Tens
So much to tell you about Chihuahuas, so little time! Part V is
packed with more useful data. You find a handy list of questions to
ask the breeder when you’re thinking of buying a dog, along with
Web sites where you can find a huge variety of additional informa-
tion. Finally, I raise the curtain on a stageful of celebrity
Chihuahuas, including Tinkerbell, Bruiser, and Gidget.
Icons Used in This Book
The pages of this book are peppered with icons in the margins.
Besides adding a little salsa, they also give you a quick bite of
Chihuahua information. Here’s what’s on the menu:
You’ll see this icon quite often. It contains advice on Chihuahua
care and training techniques and provides shortcuts to simplify life
with a dog.
There are certain tidbits of information I’d like you to keep in your
memory bank for the duration of your time as a Chihuahua owner.
This icon highlights this information.
Whoa! This Chihuahua is on full alert. This information helps you to
keep from skidding into common but potentially serious mistakes.
Every species has its own language and characteristics. These
icons define the terms dog owners in general, and Chihuahua
owners in particular, need to know. You also find some interesting
dog lore and some fun trivia.
Where to Go from Here
Don’t you just hate it when you pick up a book that you’re sure has
the information you need but it doesn’t give you a clue where to
find it? Well, I promise I won’t do that to you. This book is organ-
ized for your convenience — whether you want to “read all about
it” or simply find a trick you can teach your Chihuahua to do so
that she can show off when Great Aunt Amelia visits. 
You can start wherever you want to and easily find the information
you need. Do you want to know how to raise an outgoing, social
Chihuahua? Turn to Chapter 9. Are you concerned about house-

Part I
Is a Chihuahua Your
Canine Compadre?

In this part . . . 
I
n this part, you ﬁnd out all you ever wanted to know
about the Chihuahua’s distinctive personality and body
structure. I help you ponder the ups and downs of dog
ownership and what you can and can’t expect from your
pet. In short, Part I is the key to deciding whether the
Chihuahua’s unique disposition ﬁts your lifestyle.

Chapter 1
Sharing Your Digs with a
Dog: A Big Decision
In This Chapter
 Examining your motives for acquiring a Chihuahua
 Caring for a Chihuahua
 Focusing on the Toy breed
 Making a match with a Chihuahua
C
an money ever buy you love? Sure. Just use it to buy a
Chihuahua. Your Chihuahua won’t waffle about making a per-
manent commitment to you. In fact, expect your Chi to envelop
you in affection, do his best to protect you, and maybe even
improve your health. No kidding! Scientific studies show that a
pet’s companionship alleviates stress and helps people relax. In
many cases, dogs (and other pets) get credit for lowering their
owners’ blood pressure. However, although most Chihuahua
owners are crazy about their pets, a few wish they had never
brought a dog (or that dog) home.
I don’t want Chihuahua ownership to disappoint you, so in 
this chapter, I talk about the ups and downs of living with dogs 
in general, and Chis in particular. Is this portable pet with the 
king-sized heart the right breed for you? In this chapter, you find
the answer.
Deciding if and Why 
You Want a Dog
If you are dog-deprived, you know it. You greet all your friends’ dogs
by name, eye every dog that goes by on the street, and sometimes

even ask strangers if you can pet their pups. Maybe you surf
through your favorite breeds on the Internet or browse through
the dog magazines at the bookstore. Do you have a list of possible
puppy names in your head? You’re already a dog-goner. It won’t be
long before other dog-deprived people are asking to pet your new
puppy.
Ideally, you’re drawn to dogs, and playing with them makes you
feel good. But your reason for buying a dog may be less than ideal.
For example, maybe you’re lonely or bored, and you hope a dog
can fill the void. The truth is, a little fur wrapped around a pleasant
personality (like Manchita in Figure 1-1) spices up a bland life if
you let it. Being loved by a dog is fulfilling in itself, and you can
take it a step further and become involved in dog activities (see
Chapter 12) that can bring you excitement, new friends, and a
sense of purpose. So what’s the problem? The glitch is that dogs
purchased to relieve monotony often are ignored when the novelty
wears off.
Before buying a Chihuahua, you must decide if you’ll always 
appreciate your pet or if you just crave some instant entertain-
ment. Still not sure? Ask yourself this: “Am I ready to love a dog 
for the duration (possibly 15 years for a Chihuahua), or will a
cruise to the Caribbean be just as effective for banishing my 
boredom?”
Getting a dog is a big decision. After all, dogs are dependent, make
demands on your time, cost money, and inhibit your freedom. Is
your pet worth it? Absolutely. That’s why there are more than 60
million pet dogs in the United States. But just because dogs and
people have been best buddies through the ages doesn’t necessar-
ily mean you need to run out and get a puppy right away. Maybe
Chihuahua ownership isn’t right for you; maybe it is right for you,
but not right now. Hopefully you’ll find out by taking a look at the
ownership requirements, the breed overview, and matchmaking
tips in the following sections.
Chihuahuas are either smooth or long coated. Smooths have short
hair that’s soft and shiny (see Figure 1-1). Long coats have (you
guessed it) long hair that may be straight or wavy (see Chapter 3
for more).
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre?

Figure 1-1: Manchita is a smooth-coated Chihuahua.
Doggy Dependents Aren’t Tax
Deductible: Chi-Care Duties
Like a child, a Chihuahua relies on you for food, housing, educa-
tion, affection, toys, and medical care — and the IRS won’t even 
let you declare him. Unlike a child, your puppy won’t ever become
independent. Your Chi won’t fix his own dinner, brush his own hair,
or pay his own medical bills. Instead, he’ll depend on you for his
health and happiness all his life.
Fortunately, most dog owners enjoy the small chores that make 
up daily dog care. For some, interacting with their dogs is a restful
transition from a too-busy day. Others say that their dogs keep the
nest from feeling empty and add laughter to their lives. And when
you have a doggy dependent, you’re always the most important
thing in his life. He needs you from puppyhood through old age. 
He doesn’t graduate, get a job, marry, or move halfway across 
the country.
Chapter 1: Sharing Your Digs with a Dog: A Big Decision 11

You should discuss division of labor with your family before get-
ting a dog, but don’t expect even the most logical schedule to be
carved in stone. In the end, someone — one person — must take
responsibility, making sure your dog is fed, watered, groomed,
trained, exercised, and taken outdoors when he indicates a need 
to eliminate. Because you’re the one reading this book, I bet that
someone is you. Will you relish or resent the responsibility?
Considering the long-term cost
Can you afford a dog? I’m talking not only about the price of 
the dog (which will probably be $300 to well over $1,000 for a
Chihuahua puppy), but also the price of upkeep.
Some breeds — Chihuahuas for example — don’t eat much, but
they still need the following:
 Quality food (see Chapter 6)
 Puppy shots, an annual checkup complete with vaccinations,
and regular worming (see Part IV)
 Minor surgery to spay or neuter (see Chapter 13)
 Medication to prevent heartworm
 A crate, grooming equipment, a collar and leash, dog dishes,
and a variety of toys and treats (see Chapter 5)
And although Chis tend to be healthy, yours may rack up a big bill
if he’s ever in an accident and requires emergency surgery.
You want my take? Darn right you can afford a dog! As hard as you
work, you probably can swing that cruise to the Caribbean — if
only you had time to take a vacation. Truth is, people seldom make
time for a social life. At least you deserve the pleasure of an ador-
ing dog when you finally get home from work at night.
Placing your Chi in your 
daily schedule
So you’re doing fine financially, but maybe you’re working crazy
hours to reach the next rung up the corporate ladder. In that case,
your Chihuahua’s excited antics when you come through the door
can be just the ticket to turn your mood from office mania to
bemused tranquility. Forget fuming over a frustrating meeting.
Your dog needs to be walked and fed, and both of you will look for-
ward to snuggling through a sitcom or two. Just keep in mind that
no matter how frazzled you are, and no matter how late it is, your
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre? 
12

dog still needs your attention and affection. If you and he live
alone, especially, you’re his entire world.
Chapter 5 and the chapters of Part III deal with setting up a sched-
ule for your Chi and socializing and training your little guy.
Some offices allow employees to bring well-behaved pets to work.
My Chihuahua spent many hours in the office when I worked for
the American Kennel Club (AKC) in New York City. Sure, that’s a
special case, but while we walked to work, we saw plenty of other
pooches accompanying people carrying briefcases.
Fitting your Chi into 
your family’s future
Your spouse’s feelings about having a dog, your kids’ ages, your
activity level, and your travel plans are important considerations
when deciding whether to make a Chihuahua part of your family.
Bringing home a dog when your spouse doesn’t want one is unfair
to everyone. So is buying a breed your other half hates. Sure, a
reluctant spouse, in some cases, comes to love the dog, but often
one partner never quite comes around. Having to defend your 
dog on a daily basis gets old real fast, and you don’t need that.
Furthermore, no dog deserves to be dumped at the pound because
everyone got tired of the hassles at home.
Are you hoping to settle down and start a family in the near (or dis-
tant) future? Some breeds (Chihuahuas are one of them) are long
lived, so with luck, you can plan on your dog being with you for
your wedding and the births of your babies. But as sweet as that
sounds, it may not be a good thing. Will your spouse also love 
your dog, or will he or she consider your Chi excess baggage?
Another potential problem is that some breeds (Chihuahuas
included) don’t thrive around toddlers. It’s a no-fault, lose-lose 
situation. Tiny dogs are too delicate for young children, and kids
under the ages of 6 or 7 still are geared toward stuffed animals.
Imagine how long poor Pepe would last if a toddler tripped over
him or swung him by one leg like a stuffed teddy.
Picking up after your Chi
What kind of housekeeper are you? Is your home casual and 
relaxed — the kind of place where friends gather to munch pop-
corn and watch videos? Or is your house so immaculate that 
family members remove their shoes before stepping on the cream-
colored carpet?
Chapter 1: Sharing Your Digs with a Dog: A Big Decision 13

Puppies aren’t perfect. Chances are you’ll have to clean up some
accidents while housetraining your Chihuahua. Not only that, he’ll
shed at intervals (or constantly) all his life (see Chapter 7). Long
after he’s reliably housebroken — maybe years after you’ve moved
into your dream home — he can get sick and upchuck on the new
sofa. When that happens, will you view the mess as a minor annoy-
ance or a major tragedy? (The chapters of Part III deal with social-
izing and training your little guy.)
Even though a Chi’s poops are small, they can make a big mess on
the bottom of someone’s shoe. Don’t forget to clean up after your
dog every time you walk him (see Chapter 8). In many places, it’s
the law!
Viewing the Chihuahua 
as a Toy Breed
Say that after reading about the ups and downs of dog ownership,
you decide that you want a canine companion. Right on! You’re
going to love living with a dog — that is, if your dog lives up to
your expectations. Humans breed dogs capable of doing an
extraordinary number of things, but dogs are specialists in a sense,
and no one breed does it all. A wrong match between dog and
owner usually brings misery, like a bad marriage, while a good
match means years of satisfaction and fun.
Some Toy dogs, such as the Toy Poodle, are downsized versions 
of their larger cousins. Others, like the Miniature Pinscher, have
been around longer than the larger dogs that resemble them. The
Chihuahua isn’t a scaled-down version of anything. It’s a true Toy
breed: a breed created for the sole purpose of being companions
to people. The following sections give you more details on this
breed (for more, head to Chapters 2 and 3).
What’s terrific about Toys
What do all the Toy breeds have in common? They’re living proof
that great things really do come in small packages. Here’s the
upside of a Toy dog:
 Toy dogs are small. They fit anywhere — sometimes even 
in your pocket — and can get enough exercise in a small
apartment.
 Toy dogs are cuddly and love human attention. They form
extremely strong bonds with their people, and many are con-
tent to warm a lap for hours.
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre?

Chapter 1: Sharing Your Digs with a Dog: A Big Decision 15
Toy breeds on parade
The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes more than 150 dog breeds and divides
them into 7 groups, depending on the function each breed originally performed. The
Chihuahua is a member of the Toy Group — a companion breed to us people. The
AKC recognizes the following Toy breeds:
 Affenpinscher
 Brussels Griffon
 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
 Chihuahua (smooth or long coat)
 Chinese Crested (hairless or powderpuff)
 English Toy Spaniel
 Fox Terrier (Toy)
 Havanese
 Italian Greyhound
 Japanese Chin
 Maltese
 Manchester Terrier (Toy)
 Miniature Pinscher
 Papillon
 Pekingese
 Pomeranian
 Poodle (Toy)
 Pug
 Shih Tzu
 Silky Terrier
 Yorkshire Terrier
According to AKC statistics, the top three most popular Toy breeds in 2006 were the
Yorkshire Terrier, the Shih Tzu, and the Chihuahua. Toy Poodles also are popular, but
knowing where they rank is impossible because all three varieties (Standard,
Miniature, and Toy) are counted as one.

 Toy dogs are portable. They’re ideal for people who travel a
lot and like to take their dogs along with them.
 Toy dogs love to show off. Most of them enjoy learning new
things from upbeat trainers.
 Toy dogs often are welcome where larger breeds are not.
For example, some condo associations limit the size of pets.
 Toys are real dogs. They’re intelligent and affectionate, with
bold, fun-loving temperaments. Many of them make alert
watchdogs.
In the lingo of the dog fancier, the Chihuahua is considered a natu-
ral dog. That means his coat isn’t trimmed, shaved, stripped, or
plucked, and his ears and tail are left the way nature made them —
not trimmed or docked (in the style of the Miniature Pinscher,
among others). In dog-fancier slang, that makes the Chihuahua a
wash-and-wear breed.
Potential problems 
with portable pets
Toy dogs need careful owners. Depending on your nature, that’s
one potential downside of owning a Chihuahua. Although most
Chis think they’re tough, they’re more vulnerable to injury (espe-
cially being stepped on or tripped over) than larger dogs. Here are
some other concerns:
 When Toy dog owners overdo carrying and cuddling and
skimp on the training, their pets become spoiled. And that
turns them into tiny tyrants or nervous wimps.
 Toy breeds are social creatures. Developing that typical Toy
spirit means they need plenty of social interactions with a
variety of people from puppyhood on.
 Toy dogs that are neglected during puppyhood, or that come
from inferior stock, may suffer myriad physical and/or mental
problems at maturity.
 Some people dislike Toy dogs and may make rude remarks
about your Chi when you walk him. If you answer at all, smile
and say something like, “Shhh. He thinks he’s a tiger.”
 Toy dogs are real dogs. Like every other breed, they need
training and guidance. In other words, if you don’t train your
Chi, your Chi will train you.
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre?

Making a Match with a Chihuahua
All the Toy breeds make exceptional companions, but they aren’t
interchangeable. The 21 breeds come in a variety of shapes, coat
types, and colors, and their temperaments and activity levels vary
from lazy and laid back to extremely active and irritable. (Oops! I
don’t know any breed that I’d characterize as “irritable.” Some indi-
vidual dogs of any breed may be irritable, but definitely not the
entire breed.) Is the Chihuahua the right breed choice for you?
Here’s a synopsis of what a Chi can and can’t bring to a relation-
ship. (And for more on the Chihuahua look and disposition, see
Chapters 2 and 3.)
 Pepe is the perfect pet — for some people. Because he
thrives on togetherness, a Chihuahua is the ideal dog for
someone who’s home a lot and spends some time sitting.
That’s because Chis love to sit beside you, or better yet, on
your lap. If you work from a home office, or if some of your
favorite things are watching television, reading, or surfing the
net, your dog will be in puppy paradise. He’s also an excellent
family dog, provided the children are gentle and older than 7.
But if you’re on the go all the time and can’t make space in
your schedule to accommodate an accomplished lap warmer,
this isn’t the breed for you.
Chapter 1: Sharing Your Digs with a Dog: A Big Decision 17
Digging up the Mexican connection
Chihuahuas are lap warmers, and their purpose is companionship. But in tougher
times — before people owned pets for pure pleasure — every creature had to have
a function. “Just for fun” didn’t cut it. Historians are still uncertain about the precise
origins and uses of the earliest Chihuahuas, but legends about their beginnings
abound — a combination of fact and fantasy that makes the dog world’s littlest
breed one of its biggest mysteries.
Relics from ancient Mexico include sculptures of small dogs that archeologists dis-
covered while studying the remains of the Mayan, Toltec, and Aztec cultures.
Although some of the statues (you can see them at the National Museum in Mexico
City) don’t look much like modern Chihuahuas, and little is known about the Mayans,
some relics from the Toltecs have aroused researchers’ attention.
The Toltec Indians lived in Mexico during the ninth century, and possibly even ear-
lier. They had a dog called the Techichi, which some historians believe is the ances-
tor of today’s Chihuahua. Stone carvings of these dogs exist at the Monastery of
Huejotzingo (on the highway between Mexico City and Puebla), and they look much
more like the modern Chihuahua than the statues that are believed to be Mayan.

 Pepe tires easily. He enjoys a brisk walk around the block
when the weather is nice, but if you want a jogging or hiking
companion, check out some of the larger breeds. No, a
Chihuahua isn’t wimpy when it comes to walking. He just 
gets tired because he takes several strides to keep up with
just one of yours.
 Pepe is an alert watchdog with a bark much bigger than he
is. But he isn’t a guard dog or an attack dog, no matter what
he thinks.
 Pepe is loyal and loving. He believes in family first and is vigi-
lant and discriminating when you have visitors. Your friends
may become his friends after he gets to know them.
 Pepe is easy to groom whether he’s a smooth or a long coat.
If you’re looking forward to fussing with hair, many other Toys
have thicker, longer coats.
 Pepe is a housedog. He can’t tolerate cold or rainy weather,
garages, or drafty basements.
 Pepe is super short. That means you, your family, and your
guests must watch where you walk. Don’t worry. It becomes
second nature in a day or two. But when you or your children
have friends over, you must remind them to be careful.
 Pepe plays games with you (you can find some in Chapter
8). He may learn to fetch a ball or chase a small Frisbee, but
he won’t be able to handle any rough stuff. If you want a tough
dog that plays hard, get a larger pet.
 Pepe probably is a good traveler. Most Chihuahuas adapt
well to the open road and love to watch the world go by from
the passenger’s seat (especially when a passenger is in the
seat). Of course, a crate (see Chapter 5) is safer.
 Pepe must be taught manners, the same as any other dog.
Little and cute loses its charm real fast when your Chi devel-
ops bad habits.
 Pepe is a natural born showoff with a good memory. After
he learns a trick or two, he’ll be proud to perform for your
friends (if he’s familiar with them).
 Pepe is sensitive. He tries to comfort you when you’re sad
and dances for joy when you’re happy. He won’t feel secure in
a house full of friction.
 Pepe is delicate. He needs your protection from bigger dogs,
even if he doesn’t think so. And not just when he’s on the
ground. Big dogs have been known to snatch tiny ones right
out of their owners’ arms (yes, that’s rare, but I thought I
should warn you).
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre? 
18

Do you tend to get physical when you’re angry? If so, it’s best
not to have any pet, especially not a Chihuahua. The first hot-
tempered blow a Chihuahua receives will probably be his last.
 Pepe is intelligent and highly trainable. In fact, he’s capable
of becoming competitive in active events like agility and obe-
dience (see Chapter 12). But don’t expect miracles. He’ll
prefer indoor activities to performing on damp grass.
Loyal, intelligent, trainable, portable, and incredibly cute to boot! If
all those endearing Chihuahua charms have you captivated, you
have plenty of company. In 2006, 22,562 new Chihuahuas were reg-
istered with the American Kennel Club. That ranked the breed 11th
among the 155 AKC breeds. And in 14 major cities, Chihuahuas
placed in the top 10. The little guys are big on popularity!

What’s Behind That Unique
Chihuahua Look?
In This Chapter
 Picturing the perfect Chihuahua
 Examining heads, tails, and other body parts
 Keeping perspective — nobody’s perfect!
P
lenty of little dogs have compact bodies and expressive 
eyes (like the Toy breeds; see Chapter 3), so what makes a
Chihuahua unmistakably a Chihuahua? Details. A whole bunch 
of details combine to create a dog that looks and acts like a
Chihuahua and nothing but a Chihuahua. This chapter focuses on
appearances and gives you the official (honest!) description of
Chihuahua perfection.
Look for Yourself: The 
Classic Chihuahua
You may already have a mental picture of a Chihuahua from watch-
ing the old television ads that show Gidget, the Taco Bell dog (see
Figure 2-1), mouth his polite request for a little grub. Of course, I
should have said her request because Gidget is, after all, a gal dog
playing a guy, but that’s neither here nor there.
Next to its diminutive size, the Chihuahua’s most recognizable 
feature is its apple-domed head, which you can plainly see in
Manchita in Figure 2-2. Attached to Manchita’s signature head 
are big eyes, brimming with intelligence and an inquiring gaze
(Gidget’s gaze is intense), and erect ears, a bit bigger than you 
may expect, that add to her aspect of alertness. On top of many
Chihuahua heads, practically invisible but easily discernable
through touch, is the molera — a soft spot similar to the one found
on newborn babies. The molera is also called the fontanel.

Figure 2-1: The head of the best-known Chihuahua on television.
A Chihuahua’s body is surprisingly sturdy. Although Manchita’s feet
are dainty, her legs are muscular and swift. Her back is level, she’s a
little longer than she is tall, and she carries her tail confidently —
either in a semicircle or in a loop over her back.
Figure 2-2: Manchita presents the classic 
Chihuahua look: apple-shaped head, prominent 
leg muscles, level back, and confident tail.
The apple-shaped head and a few other features pretty much
describe a Chihuahua’s distinctive appearance, but building a com-
plete little superdog takes much more anatomy. Although knowing
the details is important to successfully showing your Chihuahua
(see Chapter 12), you don’t need to know the finer points to love
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre?

and enjoy your pet. So, if you want details, stick with me. But if
anatomy isn’t your thing, you can skip the following section.
Striving for the Picture-Perfect
Chihuahua
Believe it or not, a blueprint exists for building a picture-perfect
Chihuahua (and every other AKC registered breed). The blueprint
is called the Official Standard for the Chihuahua. Of course, no dog is
perfect (just as no person — not even a Miss America — is perfect),
so no matter how charming a Chihuahua appears, the knowledge-
able eyes of a good breeder or dog show judge always find room for
improvement. Even the best breeders always have something to
strive for.
Breed standards are serious stuff. Selecting breeding partners with
the standard in mind is how breeders produce generation after
generation of dogs that look and act like Chihuahuas. The best
breeders try to produce dogs that come as close to matching the
standard as possible, and dog-show judges select winners by com-
paring how closely each competitor matches its breed standard.
(Head to Chapter 12 for more info on dog competitions.)
In Figure 2-3, you see dog lingo describing the external features of
the Chihuahua. This is a handy diagram to refer to as you cruise
through the details in the following sections. Pretty soon, you’ll be
able to speak the language of dog people — breeders, show
exhibitors, and judges.
Chapter 2: What’s Behind That Unique Chihuahua Look? 23
Just like schools, Chihuahuas 
have a parent group
Every breed of dog that the American Kennel Club recognizes is backed by a
national organization known as a parent club. Parent clubs educate owners and
breeders and create the standards of excellence for their breeds. Respected breed-
ers within the parent club write standards that the club membership must approve.
The standards are created for the long term, and they seldom change. The parent
club for the Chihuahua is the Chihuahua Club of America (CCA).
What can reading the Chihuahua standard do for you? It helps you develop an eye
for an excellent specimen and understand what makes the breed unique. The only
problem: The standard is hard to follow because it was written as a guide for judges
and breeders, who already understand dog lingo. Not to worry: Throughout the rest
of this chapter, I translate the official talk into plain English.

Figure 2-3: All the parts of the Chihuahua.
General appearance and demeanor
The Chihuahua is a graceful, alert, swift-moving, and compact 
little dog with a saucy expression and terrier-like qualities of 
temperament.
A Chi is compact, feels solid in your hands, and appears well pro-
portioned. She isn’t long of body or lanky or too tall. Like a terrier,
she’s confident, animated, spirited, curious, and interested in
everything happening around her.
Size and proportion
A Chihuahua is a well-balanced little dog, weighing not more than 
6 pounds (to qualify for the show ring). Her body is off-square, to
quote the official standard — she should be slightly longer when
measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks than she is
tall at the withers, or the top of her shoulders. Somewhat shorter
bodies (in length) are preferred in males. A Chi’s height is the dis-
tance from the highest point of her withers to the floor; her length
is the distance from the point of her shoulder to the point of her
buttock. (Refer to Figure 2-3 to see all the technical terms applied
to the dog.)
The reason a little more length is desired in females than it is in
males is because females need the extra space to carry puppies.

A Chihuahua needs a balanced appearance. That means every part
of its body must be in proportion with its other parts. If her legs
appear too long for her body or her head appears too small for her
neck, she will look like she’s made from spare parts.
In general, many breeds are considered square, meaning that their
height is the same as their length. But the Chihuahua is supposed
to be just a little longer than it is tall.
Head
To meet the standard, the shape of a Chihuahua’s head should look
sort of like an apple — rounded but not completely round. If she
has a molera, you’ll feel a slight indentation, like the soft spot on a
baby’s skull, when you gently stroke the top of her head. Breeders
prefer eyes to be large, set well apart, radiant, and shiny — not
close together, protruding, smallish, or dull. For perfect propor-
tions, the middle of the eyes lines up with the lowest part of the
ears. The following sections break down the rest of the head.
Ears
If a Chi has ideal ears, they’ll be at a 45-degree angle to her head
when she’s resting, but they’ll come to attention, held high, when
Chapter 2: What’s Behind That Unique Chihuahua Look? 25
A soft spot for Chihuahuas
Many historians contend that the Chihuahua is a native Mexican breed (see Chapter
1), but others argue that the breed originated in the Mediterranean — particularly
on the island of Malta. According to proponents of the Malta theory, a tiny dog with
a molera (a soft spot on its head — a trait unique to Chihuahuas) became estab-
lished there and traveled on trading ships to European ports. To back up the theory,
these historians point out that many paintings produced by European masters
include small dogs resembling the Chihuahua. The most famous of these paintings
is a fresco in the Sistine Chapel, created by Sondro Botticelli around 1482. Part of a
series illustrating the life of Moses, Sons of Moses includes a little dog with a round
head, big eyes, large erect ears, and other distinct Chihuahua characteristics. The
painting was completed ten years before Columbus dropped anchor in the New
World, so it’s a sure bet that Botticelli never saw or heard of a Mexican dog, yet he
painted something incredibly close to a Chihuahua.
Another theory contends that Chihuahuas originated in China and were brought to
Mexico about 200 years ago. Supporters of this theory say that the Chinese were
known for dwarfing plants and animals, and when wealthy Chinese merchants
established homes in Mexico, they brought their little canine companions with them.

she’s alert. She may flatten them against her skull when she’s
moving fast or when something makes her uneasy.
How a dog holds its ears (for example, alertly erect or relaxed) is
called its ear carriage.
Chihuahua ears must be left as nature made them. Cropped ears (sur-
gically shaped or shortened ears) aren’t permitted on Chihuahuas 
in the show ring. And broken ear cartilage, resulting in a droopy or
lopsided ear, is grounds for disqualification from showing.
Muzzle (snout)
The standard calls for a muzzle, or snout, that’s moderately short,
but that doesn’t mean shorter is better. A super-short muzzle is
incorrect in the Chihuahua, because extremely short muzzles can
cause breathing problems and crowd the teeth. Ideally, the muzzle
should emerge from the skull at a right angle.
Teeth
If a Chi’s upper-front teeth meet tightly outside her lower-front
teeth, she has a scissors bite; if her upper and lower incisors (front
teeth) meet flush with each other when her mouth is closed, her
bite is level. The scissors bite is the strongest bite and is consid-
ered ideal. The teeth wear down faster when the bite is level.
Neck, topline, and body
An attractive neck from a side view flows smoothly and gracefully
into your Chihuahua’s withers without wrinkles or folds. Ideally,
her neck is of medium length. Too short of a neck may be the
result of improperly placed shoulder blades, which prevent her
from moving well (see the section “Gait” later in this chapter). If
her head appears to be attached directly to her shoulders, she’ll
look unbalanced and front-heavy.
On the other hand, an extremely long neck may be a sign that she
lacks substance (appears weak). It may be accompanied by too-
long legs and a lanky body. You should look for graceful lines. All
the dog’s parts should be well balanced in relation to one another.
A Chi’s topline flows along the top of her back from the withers 
to the root of her tail (where the tail meets the body). Ideally, it
should be level or straight, without a dip in the middle or a down-
ward or upward slope. Her body should appear rounded rather
than flat along the sides; she needs a roomy rib cage to house her
heart and lungs.
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre? 
26

A dog’s conformation is the shape of her body from the top of her
head to the tips of her toes and tail. It encompasses balanced body
proportions and size, both of which need to be correct for the
breed.
Tail
Figure 2-4 illustrates the Chihuahua’s three correct tail positions
and presents what a sorry tail tuck looks like. When a Chihuahua
puts its tail between its legs, something is wrong. The dog may be
timid, frightened, cold, or sick. Note: A cropped tail or bobtail dis-
qualifies a dog from the show ring.
Forequarters
Well-laid-back shoulder blades are important in a Chihuahua.
(Sloping shoulders can also be described as well-laid-back.) That
means her shoulder blade, or scapula, connects her upper-arm
bone with her vertebrae with an obvious backward slope from its
bottom end (at the arm) to its top (just in front of the withers).
Why are well-laid-back shoulder blades important? Because slop-
ing shoulder blades allow a Chi’s front legs to have a good range of
motion. Shoulders that lack this slope are called straight shoulders.
They’re faulty because the upper end of the shoulder blade is too
far forward — crammed right into the dog’s neck. Besides making
the neck look too short, straight shoulder blades shorten a dog’s
gait by limiting the forward reach of her front legs.
Here are some more forequarter considerations on the 
Chihuahua:
 Ideally, a Chihuahua’s front legs should be straight while her
toes point forward. Being bowlegged is a fault, as is an east-
west front (toes pointing to either side) or toeing in (toes
pointing toward each other).
 Feet that are elongated like a rabbit’s foot or rounded like a
cat’s paw aren’t desirable. Instead, her feet need to reach a
happy medium between the two, with her toes separated but
not splayed (flat and spread apart).
 The pasterns are the lowest points on a Chi’s front legs, just
above her feet. They need to be slender and straight.

positions — and one sorry tail tuck.

Hindquarters
To give you a little taste of dog talk, the perfect Chihuahua’s rear
end is officially described as “Muscular, with hocks well apart, nei-
ther out nor in, well let down, firm and sturdy. The feet are as in
front.” Have you got that? Well the first word, “muscular,” is obvi-
ous, and what the rest of it means is that a Chihuahua’s hind leg
has an upper and lower thigh, separated by the stifle, or knee joint,
which is located on the frontal part of the dog’s hind leg (don’t
forget Figure 2-3). The upper and lower thighs need to have suffi-
cient muscle. Between the stifle joint and the foot is the hock joint.
Hock joints that are much lower than the middle of the hind leg are
better. Well let down means the hock joint is rather close to the
ground.
Rear legs that are absolutely parallel when viewed from behind are
ideal. Hocks turning toward each other, known as cowhocks, and
hocks turned outward (bowed or spread) are faulty.
Coat
Chihuahuas come in two varieties — smooth coat and long coat. If a
Chi has a smooth coat, her hair is short and close to her body, and
she may or may not have an undercoat — a protective layer of
shorter fur underneath the outer or top coat. A smooth Chihuahua
that has an undercoat appears more thickly coated and usually has
a furrier tail and a ruff of thicker hair around its neck. If a Chi has
no undercoat, her hair is sparser. In fact, it may be so thin that she
appears nearly bald on parts of her head, ears, chest, and belly.
If a Chi is long coated, she has an undercoat, and her outer coat 
is between 1 inch and 1 1⁄2 inch long. She also has the following
characteristics:
 Her ears are decorated with longish hair called fringe or 
feathering.
 She has an abundant ruff around her neck.
 She has long hair called a plume on her tail.
 She has wispy hair on the back of her legs.
 She sports natural pants — long hair on her buttocks.
Aside from that, she should look exactly like a smooth Chihuahua,
because the two varieties have exactly the same conformation
(body structure) underneath their coats. (For more on coats, jump
to Chapter 3.)
Chapter 2: What’s Behind That Unique Chihuahua Look? 29

A sparse coat disqualifies only long-coated Chihuahuas from the
show ring. Short-coated dogs with thin hair are considered normal,
although a thicker coat usually is more attractive.
Color
Any color — solid, marked, or splashed, take your pick — and 
all combinations of colors and markings are acceptable in
Chihuahuas. None are considered better or worse than others.
Gait
If you walk at a normal pace, a Chihuahua should easily be able to
keep up with you by moving along at a smart trot. When she gaits
properly, she wastes no motion — no high-stepping hackney or
goose steps. Her feet don’t turn in toward each other or wing out
to the side. In fact, her movement is lively but effortless, and only
her legs are involved. Her back (topline in dog lingo) should remain
level and not roll from side to side, bob up and down, or appear
concave (dip in the topline) or convex (roached back).
One way to check your Chi’s movement is to watch while someone
else trots her squarely toward you and away from you on a leash. 
If her movements are ideal, you’ll see only her front legs as she
approaches you and only her rear legs as she moves away. While
watching her from the side, her front legs should reach out but
stay close to the ground, and her rear legs (which actually power
the dog) should have good drive. None of her legs should interfere
with each other. If you’re not sure about rear drive, watch her trot
away from you again. Can you see the pads of her back feet? If so,
she probably has plenty of drive.
When a Chihuahua stands relaxed, her front feet may turn ever so
slightly away from each other, toward either side, and still be cor-
rect. In fact, if they point perfectly in front when the dog is in a
casual stance, chances are they’ll point toward each other (toe in)
rather than straight ahead when the dog moves.
Temperament
A Chihuahua should be bright, bold, and saucy, but that’s just the
gist of it. Chihuahua temperament deserves a full chapter, not a
paragraph. Read all about it in Chapter 3.

What if Manchita Doesn’t 
Match the Standard?
To be honest with you, the real Manchita misses out on matching
the breed standard in several places. (You can’t see Manchita’s
faults in Figure 2-3. The picture was taken before she developed
them.) Yet, she’s happy, healthy, and pushing 12 years old, with the
attitude and energy of a puppy. Her bite is wrong, but she chews
just fine. She’s fiddle-fronted (bowlegged with her toes turned out),
but she’s agile and likes going for brisk walks. If you’ve just read
about the Chihuahua standard and discovered that your precious
pet isn’t perfect, don’t worry. As long as her faults don’t affect her
health and mobility, only a top breeder or judge will know or care.
The truth is, no dog — not even an AKC Champion — matches
every word of the standard. Show dogs just have to come pretty
close, or their careers end early.
Naturally, it’s most important that dogs used for breeding comply
with the standard, because their quality is reflected in the next
generation. Breeding to its own standard is what makes each breed
of dog unique. If breeders ignore the details, soon Chihuahuas,
Papillons, Miniature Pinschers, and other Toy dogs will resemble
each other, and the individual breeds will gradually fade away.
Chapter 4 covers the ins and outs of choosing a breeder, and
Chapter 16 provides questions you can ask a breeder to make sure
he or she has taken the proper steps to produce the best dogs.

W
hat makes the world’s smallest dog one of our nation’s
most popular pets? The Chihuahua’s perky personality, of
course. Yes, this unique breed has more going for it than a serious
case of the cutes. Chihuahuas are protective despite their size and
react appropriately to their owners’ moods. They love lovin’, travel
well, and adore creature comforts. In this chapter, I talk about the
traits of a typical Chihuahua — complete with all its characteris-
tics and quirks.
I discuss how Chihuahuas usually react to other animals; the 
personality differences between Chihuahuas with short and long
coats; and what must go right so your Chi can mature with the per-
sonality traits typical of the breed.
This Bit of a Dog Is 
Big on Character
The breed standard for the Chihuahua describes its temperament
as “terrier-like,” so I’ll start by talking about typical terrier person-
ality. Most small terriers (think Fox Terriers and Scottish Terriers)
originally were bred to go to ground after prey. They helped keep
wily foxes out of henhouses and rats from fouling the feed in barns,

and they didn’t hesitate to take on badgers, snakes, or anything
else that intruded near their people or property. Although few ter-
riers do their traditional work today, most retain their feistiness
and are brave to a fault. Terriers are alert to their surroundings,
quick to defend home and family, and positive that they’re tougher
than the biggest dog on the block, making them alert watchdogs
and energetic, playful companions.
The following sections break down the individual characteristics of
the Chihuahua.
Petite protectors
Although few Chihuahuas care to go rat hunting (aren’t you glad!),
they do have several terrier traits. Bravado is one example. When
your Chi trots down the street with you, he appears animated and
confident — a bantam rooster with a proud posture.
Most Chihuahuas don’t realize that they’re small. Given the oppor-
tunity, they may approach big dogs in play, and occasionally —
especially if the large dogs are invading their territory — they may
act aggressively.
Although a tiny terror, barking and running full force, sends some
gigantic dogs packing, this situation isn’t safe. Toy breed owners
need to exercise caution around strange dogs, because even the
friendliest medium-sized dog can seriously injure a small one
during rough play.
The Chihuahuas’ bravado makes them good watchdogs. Like terri-
ers, they’re alert and have amazingly keen hearing, and they pos-
sess a bark that’s loud and shrill for their size. To top it off, they
can tell the difference between a family member’s footsteps or a
stranger’s stride nearing the door, and they know when a vehicle
other than the family car pulls up to the house.
Chihuahuas have an unjust reputation for excessive barking. Most
bark an alarm when a stranger approaches, but when properly
trained (see Part III), they won’t be any noisier than most other
breeds.
Close companions
A Chi is an affectionate animal that dogs your footsteps from room
to room, because awake or asleep, he wants to be near you. Some
breeds always seem in search of mischief, but the typical adult
Chihuahua is content with its owner’s company (see Figure 3-1 for
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre? 
34

an example). After your Chi grows out of his busy puppy stages,
he’s happiest when you and he are close — preferably touching.
An accomplished cuddler, the Chihuahua lies on your lap for as
long as you’ll let him, helping you relax as you read the paper or
watch television. He adores being stroked when you have a free
hand, and a gentle massage transports him to puppy paradise.
Don’t be surprised if he rolls over to beg for a belly rub!
Figure 3-1: Chihuahuas need affection and 
thrive on togetherness.
After all that togetherness, your Chi may not want you to leave 
him, even at bedtime. Many Chihuahuas sleep in their owners’ 
bedrooms, but not necessarily in their beds. You can train him to
snooze in his own soft bed or crate, which is where he’ll curl up
when the lights go out (see Chapter 10). It’s safer than sharing
space with him in your bed. Sure, he’d rather snuggle up with you,
but he can easily get hurt if you roll over onto him during the night.
Comfort-loving creatures
Chihuahuas are heat seekers and masters of the art of relaxation.
Indoors, your Chi will play bathing beauty, stretching out on the
carpet right where a sunbeam shines through the window. On gray
Chapter 3: Perusing the Particulars of Chihuahua Charm 35

days, he’ll seek out another source of warmth, napping near a heat-
ing vent or in his own bed — that is, if your lap isn’t available.
You’ll know that your Chihuahua is a little chilly when he curls up
into a ball with his nose under one leg. Dogs do that because it
allows them to breathe in air that got preheated by the warmth of
their bodies. Inhaling the warm air helps keep them cozy.
The ultimate house dog
If you pick up a leash and say, “Wanna go for a walk?” most breeds
beat you to the door while dancing in ecstatic circles. Nevertheless,
don’t be surprised if your Chi plants his feet and gives you a long-
suffering look that translates into, “Do I have to?”
Most Chihuahuas (some exceptions live in semitropical climates)
prefer their homes to the great outdoors. Lovers of warmth and soft-
ness, they consider cold concrete and dewy grass hardships to be
endured, not enjoyed. (If your Chi is a smooth coat, he chills easily,
sometimes shivering from ear tips to toes. See the later section
“Decisions, Decisions: Comparing Long/Smooth Coats.”) He also
hates rain, and it’s no wonder. Imagine being so low to the ground
that every step you take splashes cold water onto your bare belly! Of
course, you must take your pet outside no matter what the weather
so he can eliminate on schedule (see Chapter 10). (Chapter 5 covers
accessories you can purchase that help keep him comfortable.)
On cold days, it’s amusing to see how fast some Chihuahuas get
their business over with so they can rush back to their warm
homes. When I lived in New York, I carried Manchita to the curb
during winter; otherwise, she squatted the second her toes
touched the sidewalk!
Cautious compadres
Typical adult Chihuahuas are sassy with strangers and discriminat-
ing about making new friends. Few Chihuahuas, no matter how well
socialized they are, run up to a houseguest and vie for his or her
attention. Instead, Pepe makes sure you know a stranger is in the
house by barking at the intruder until you tell him “Enough!” (see
Chapter 10). After that, he’ll probably take a position with a view 
of your visitor from across the room for several minutes until
deciding that the person deserves canine company. Then his 
likely approach will be a slow and gradual offering of his furry
friendship — provided that your guest lets him make the first
move and resists the temptation to grab at him.
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre? 
36

To speed up the buddy-making process between your friends and
your dog, tell your guests to ignore your Chi until he approaches
them. Then they can reciprocate by tickling him on the chest or
under the chin. These actions are less threatening than reaching
over him to pet his head. Chihuahuas don’t like it when strangers
swoop down on them from above like hungry hawks. If your
friends squat down and let your Chi check them out, they’ll soon
become best buddies.
A Chihuahua probably will make friends much faster on neutral
ground (such as a park) than in his own home, because he doesn’t
feel the need to defend neutral territory.
Spirited, but not hyper
Although they’re playful pets, Chihuahuas aren’t hyper little dogs.
In fact, most of them don’t have an especially high activity level.
Rather than racing around the living room, your Chi prefers spend-
ing part of his day on your lap or burrowed beneath a blanket. His
attitude about exercise is easygoing — ready to play when you are
but content to relax when you aren’t in an active mood.
As Chihuahuas mature, they tend to take on the same activity level
as their people. The same dog that acts frisky when he’s around
his active family will turn into a contented cuddler when grandma
and grandpa dog-sit.
Even though Chihuahuas prefer human company, properly trained
adult dogs can occupy themselves for hours without looking for
trouble or demanding attention. The Chapters of Part III cover
training exercises, including making your dog feel comfortable
when alone.
Chapter 3: Perusing the Particulars of Chihuahua Charm 37
Environment trumps heredity
Although caution in choosing friends is a Chihuahua trait, not every adult Chihuahua
is persnickety about meeting new people. Three-pound Manchita, for example (see
Chapter 2), makes a merry dash into the arms of anyone who shows interest in her.
When she was a puppy, my daughters were teenagers who had friends coming and
going daily. All the kids fussed over Manchita during her formative months, so she
grew up believing that every human is a potential petting machine. Manchita is
almost 12 years old now, and she still falls for friendly people at first sight.

Unusually adaptable
Chihuahuas thrive in living quarters ranging from country estates
to studio apartments. Don’t worry about stairs or elevators; after
you introduce your Pepe to them (see Chapter 9), he will handle
them just fine.
Because Chihuahuas are so small, they don’t need fenced yards or
kennel runs to get their exercise. You can give yours a few toys
(see Chapter 5) and he’ll play active games right in the living room.
Or better yet, you can join in the fun, and both of you will get some
exercise. I suggest some games you can play together in Chapter 8.
Chihuahuas are good travelers and adjust to moving better than
many breeds. They feel at home wherever their owners are. That
attitude, plus their small size, makes Chihuahuas an ideal dog for
people who have to move frequently and for retired couples who
crisscross the country in RVs.
If you move often, a Chihuahua won’t mind — but you should think
twice before buying one anyway. Finding rental housing that allows
dogs often is difficult. My daughters faced that problem when they
took Manchita to college, but they finally solved it by taking her
along to meet potential landlords. When one landlord saw how
petite and polite Manchita was, he made an exception. And the
girls did their part by keeping her in a well-equipped playpen (the
type meant for an infant) when they weren’t home to supervise
(see Chapter 5).
Sensitive supporters
Chihuahuas can sense their owners’ moods and will react accord-
ingly. When you arrive home after receiving a promotion, your Chi
will recognize right away that something wonderful happened and
dances around you with glee. But he’ll also sense when you’re sick
or sad, and he’ll try to be consoling. Stories abound about
Chihuahuas that stopped playing and had to be reminded to eat
and even eliminate when family members were bedridden with
serious illnesses. These companions tried to spend all their time
with the sick persons.
Quick studies when trained with TLC
Although housetraining any dog (see Chapters 10 and 11) is a
chore, most of the other training you give your Chi should be pure
pleasure for both of you. Chihuahuas love being center stage and
are eager to learn — provided that the training is gentle, upbeat,
Part I: Is a Chihuahua Your Canine Compadre? 
38

and complete with plenty of positive reinforcement (read: praise
and treats). Because they’re so people oriented, Chihuahuas have
longer attention spans (when they’re past the puppy stage) than
many other breeds. If you make training fun, your pup will focus his
big eyes on you and pirouette happily every time you praise him.
After he learns a new trick, your Chi will never forget it. He may,
however, try to improvise. Some Chis are so clever that as soon as
they perfect a trick, they invent a new way to ham it up. Many
Chihuahuas are successful in competitive sports such as obedience
and agility. You can read all about those activities in Chapter 12.
Long-term friend
If your Chi is a healthy, well-bred Chihuahua (see Chapter 2) and
you take good care of him, chances are he’ll live well into his teens.
Chihuahuas are one of the longest-lived breeds. And that’s great
news for the humans who love them!
Friend to (most) other critters
Your Chihuahua may sass strange dogs when he’s out for a walk
(basic obedience training cures that; see Chapters 9 and 10), but
he should get along with the other pets in your home. After you
make the introductions (see Chapter 5) and the pets get used to
each other, your Pepe likely will curl up with your cat, ignore your
caged birds, and become buddies with your bigger dog.
Don’t be surprised if he shows a jealous streak over who gets the
most attention, though. Dogs usually work these things out for
themselves (with the Chihuahua often becoming the dominant
dog). Just be sure to supervise the animals closely until they get
used to each other and obviously get along.
Have you read about the terrier traits I talked about earlier in this
chapter? You should keep little critters like hamsters, gerbils, igua-
nas, and small birds out of your Chi’s reach, or pouncing on them
may be just too tempting.
One unique Chihuahuaism is that the breed recognizes, and almost
always welcomes, its own. Even though your Chi may seem sassy
or even scared around strange dogs, in most cases he’ll become
ecstatic at the sight of another Chihuahua, and the two will quickly
make friends.
Chapter 3: Perusing the Particulars of Chihuahua Charm 39

Decisions, Decisions: Comparing
Long/Smooth Coats
When deciding whether you want a long-coated or a smooth-
coated Chihuahua (see Chapter 2), you should consider more than
just the length of coat you want to cuddle. That’s because the dif-
ferences are more than skin deep. In general (with some excep-
tions), slight personality differences exist between the two coat
types. Here are the more obvious differences:
 Long coats can handle the cold better. Although no
Chihuahua can stand the cold for long, many long coats enjoy
a short walk in brisk weather and may even play in the snow
(provided it’s only a couple inches deep). Not the case with
smooth coats. Chihuahuas with short hair are miserable in
cold weather and should wear a sweater outdoors on chilly
days, even when going for a short walk (see Chapter 5).
 Smooth coats cuddle closer. A short-coated Chi will enjoy
feeling the warmth of your body on his nearly bald belly as he
lies on your lap while you read or watch television. His long-
coated counterpart wants your company, too, but he’s more
likely to sit beside you rather than on you. Differences also
are noticeable if you decide to bed down with him. A smooth
coat curls up under the covers, and a long coat usually lies on
top of the blankets.
 Long coats shed less. No, that isn’t a misprint. Long-coated
Chihuahuas shed seasonally — usually twice a year. During
those periods, they lose a lot of hair quite quickly. But a few
good brushings, plus vacuuming the carpets and furniture, put
an end to the problem for several months (see Chapter 7).
Smooth coats, on the other hand, shed old hair and replace it
with new hair all the time. Consequently, a few tiny hairs always
will work their way into your clothes, furniture, and carpets.
 Long coats are a bit more reserved. Smooth coats often are
more outgoing and accept new friends faster than long coats.
Although long coats like attention, too, they tend to be a little
more reserved and need more time to warm up to friendly
strangers.
Long coats and smooth coats often are littermates, which means
they’re brothers and sisters born in the same litter. According to
an old wives’ tale, at least one long-coated Chihuahua appears in
every litter of smooth coats — a gift from Mother Nature to keep
its short-coated littermates warm. Although this is a sweet story, it
doesn’t always happen that way. Besides, smooth-coated pups

don’t need the help. They do just fine by cuddling up to their mom
and to each other.
Battle of the Sexes: Observing
Male and Female Traits
You can find plenty of Chihuahua lore concerning which sex makes
the better pet. Some people favor males while others extol the
virtues of females. The truth is, the personality of a puppy’s par-
ents is a much better indicator of potential temperament than
which sex the pup happens to be. Even so, you should be aware 
of a few characteristic differences between the sexes before you
decide on the dog you want:
 Unspayed females have heat cycles (usually twice a year), and
these can make a mess on your clothing and furniture. And
even if your female is indoors almost all the time, neighbor-
hood males still can smell her enticing scent and serenade
her. You can’t let her out of your sight when she’s in season,
or it could result in an unwanted pregnancy — or worse if her
suitor is big enough to injure her.
 An unneutered male has a sex drive that makes him follow a
female’s sexy scent until he finds the female — no matter how
big she is or how many larger dogs also are competing for her
favor. Consequently, he can become quite the escape artist
and put himself in life-threatening situations. He also may take
out his frustrations by becoming affectionate with a throw
pillow or someone’s shin (see Chapter 11). Some unneutered
males tend to be aggressive with other dogs, and a Chihuahua
in a fighting mood believes that he’s the biggest bruiser on the
block — a dangerous situation.
 Male and female Chihuahuas are equally affectionate and
appealing, and initially take about the same amount of time to
housebreak. But many males (if they haven’t been neutered)
disregard their training when they get old enough to lift their
legs and mark their property (a sign of sexual maturity) and
may regress to urinating in the house You can correct the
problem by catching it early and returning the male to his
crate-training puppy schedule (see Chapter 10) for a few
weeks. If that doesn’t do the trick, you can find help for hard
cases in Chapter 11.
The good news is that spaying or neutering nullifies much of the
behavior in the previous list, making males and females equally
excellent as pets. Chapter 13 discusses the altering procedure and
its importance for your pet.
Chapter 3: Perusing the Particulars of Chihuahua Charm 41

Checking a Chi Pup’s Résumé
Several things must go right before a Chihuahua puppy grows up
to be typical of his breed. A puppy will mature with characteristics
that people admire if it is
 Well bred (comes from good stock; see Chapters 1 and 2)
 Adequately cared for on a daily basis (a clean habitat and
quality food, for instance)
 Socialized by a caring breeder
 Further socialized by its owner (see Chapter 9)
 Raised with attention and affection
 Taught basic house manners (see Chapter 10)
 Never abused or neglected
If any of these necessities are missing during the dog’s upbringing,
or if it gets neglected or abused, chances are it won’t behave like a
typical Chihuahua. Unfortunately, Chihuahuas often get a bad rap
from people who meet sorry excuses for dogs and decide that the
entire breed behaves badly.
The following undesirable traits are the ones that frequently
plague poorly bred, undernourished, unsocialized, untrained, or
unloved members of this breed. These traits are, in a sense, typical
of the atypical:
 Timid, shy, or extremely nervous
 Frail and sickly
 Temperamental
 Refuses to accept friendly strangers
 Yappy
 Vicious (snaps at people without warning and for no reason)
 Possessive (defends his food dish, toys, or favorite chair, even
from his owners)
Oh my! That’s a scary list, isn’t it? I bet it doesn’t sound like any-
thing you want in a dog. Don’t panic. In Chapter 4, I tell you how to
avoid the unhappy traits and find a Chihuahua with the potential
to grow up with all the breed’s best characteristics.

W
hew! You’ve made the really big decisions (if you haven’t,
head back to Chapters 1–3). You’re sure you want a dog,
and you think a Chihuahua is the breed for you. But you aren’t 
finished yet. Now you have to make the most important decision 
of all — picking the one special Chihuahua to share your life.
Easy now. Don’t rush. Picking your pet may be your only opportu-
nity, outside of marriage, to actually choose a member of your
family! All Chihuahuas and Chihuahua distributors aren’t created
equal, so in this chapter, we go shopping together. I can help you
find a good breeder and a healthy dog with that charming
Chihuahua character. And I help you understand all the paperwork
involved in the process — such as AKC registration applications
and pedigrees.
There’s no such thing as a teacup Chihuahua. Contrary to false
advertisements, Chihuahuas aren’t classified by size. Typical
Chihuahuas weigh between 3 and 6 pounds. Dogs a little larger
than 6 pounds make excellent pets — especially when children are
in the family — but you should think twice before buying an espe-
cially tiny Chihuahua. Pups wrongly advertised as miniature or
teacup often are too delicate for the average home and may have
health problems.

Buying from a Breeder
The first step toward finding a fabulous four-legged family member is
locating a respected breeder. The best Chi breeders usually special-
ize in Chihuahuas, devoting years to preserving the breed’s finest
traits (see Chapter 2). Good breeders often are members of the
Chihuahua Club of America (CCA; www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.
com), and perhaps local dog clubs as well. Whether they have just a
few adult dogs or a large kennel, their breeding stock is excellent,
they give their puppies plenty of affection, and they probably exhibit
at dog shows (see Chapter 12).
Here are several general suggestions to help you find a good
kennel in your area: After you find one, the following sections take
you all the way through the process, from visiting a breeder to
picking out your puppy:
 Go to the American Kennel Club’s Web site (www.akc.org)
and click on its Breeder Referral link. Or you can call AKC
Customer Care at 919-233-9767 for suggestions.
 Ask the Chihuahua Club of America (www.chihuahuaclub
ofamerica.com) for literature on the breed and for the
address of the regional Chihuahua club closest to you.
Contact that club for a list of member-breeders. You can 
do it all on the Net (see Chapter 17 for more resources).
 Talk to local veterinarians (see Chapter 13). They know
which breeders have healthy dogs with terrific temperaments.
 Find the all-breed kennel club nearest you. Almost every 
sizable city has an all-breed kennel club. Ask around at a vet-
erinary clinic, or call the library. Contact the all-breed club to
find out if any of its members are Chihuahua breeders.
 Look at the breeder ads in dog magazines. You can check
out AKC Gazette, Dog World, and Dog Fancy, for instance.
Besides being available by subscription, the magazines are
sold in many bookstores and at newsstands.
 Go to a dog show. Good breeders travel many miles to show
their dogs, and they’ll be glad to talk to you after they finish
competing. (Don’t bother them during the heat of competition!)
Dog shows are fun and educational even if you have no inter-
est in showing your dog. With luck, you’ll see several
Chihuahuas in the show ring. Watching them may help you
decide what traits appeal to you. If several of your favorites
come from the same breeder, you know where to look first.
Find out from your local all-breed kennel club or the American
Kennel Club (AKC) when shows are scheduled in your area
(see Chapter 12 for more).

Visiting the breeder
Most reputable breeders cherish their Chihuahuas as a hobby, not
a business. They’re proud to show you their facilities and tell you
about their dogs. Just be sure to contact them ahead of time to set
up appointments. Breeders don’t keep regular business hours like
pet shops do, and their facilities are almost always attached to
their homes. So meeting a breeder and seeing his or her stock is a
lot like visiting someone socially.
Making a list of what you want in a Chihuahua and letting the
breeders know your criteria before you visit simplifies things. For
example, tell the breeder if you’re set on a male or a female, a
smooth or a long coat, a certain color, and whether you plan to
show your dog (see Chapter 12). That way, a breeder can save you
a trip if he or she doesn’t have what you want, and he or she may
be able to send you to another kennel where your dream dog
awaits. Try visiting a few breeders and seeing several puppies
before making a decision.
Evaluating the breeder
Locating a Chihuahua breeder and setting up an appointment is
only the first step. Just because you locate a breeder doesn’t mean
he or she is reputable or right for you. Here’s how to make sure
you’ve found a good breeder (see Chapter 16 for more evaluation
advice):
 If you see brood stock of several different breeds on the prem-
ises, or notice that the puppies are treated like merchandise,
don’t purchase a puppy from that kennel. The best breeders
specialize in one or two breeds, enjoying their dogs as a
hobby rather than a business. They may even exhibit their
stock at dog shows.
 Healthy puppies come from clean kennels. Check out the floor
or grass the puppies are playing on. Has it been washed or
pooper-scooped recently, or is it covered with miniature
messes? Sneak a peek at the food and water dishes. Is the food
dish clean, or is ancient goop stuck to the sides? Is the water
clear or has yellow slime invaded the bottom of the dish? Use
your nose. Sure, you’ll catch a whiff of fresh puppy poop, but if
the stench is stale or overwhelming, try another kennel.
 The puppy play area shouldn’t be bare; the puppies should
have a few toys to play with. Toys serve a purpose. They stim-
ulate puppies physically and mentally, motivating them to
exercise, play together, and learn.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 47

Even the healthiest pups become limp as dishrags when
they’re sleepy. If the pups you’re visiting can’t seem to stay
awake, ask the breeder to schedule another visit at a different
time of day.
 A good breeder knows the puppies’ personalities inside out
and should gladly discuss them with you. In fact, he or she
may talk nonstop and tell you even more than you want to
know about the puppies, their parents, and extended family.
Yes, good breeders may brag about their dogs, but that’s a
good sign. It proves that they’re proud of their breeding and
spend enough time with their dogs to know them well.
 A good breeder should give you a grilling (see the following sec-
tion). That means he or she wants to be sure that a Chi is the
right breed for your family and that you’ll give the puppy a good
home. Steer clear of money-hungry puppy vendors who pretend
Chihuahuas are ideal pets for everyone. It simply isn’t so.
 Chihuahua puppies need to stay with their dam and litter-
mates until they’re at least 8 weeks old. Beware of any breeder
who’s willing to let a pup leave for its new home any sooner
than that.
 A good breeder will tell you that if you ever have to give up
your Chihuahua, he or she will take her back and find her a
new home.
 A good breeder may feed you endless data about how to raise
and care for a Chihuahua. You may get annoyed by all the you
shoulds, but cut the overprotective mommy or daddy some
slack. You’re talking to a caring person who willingly shares
information and who someday, when you need advice, will be
willing to help.
 Don’t be surprised if the breeder displays the puppies’ pedi-
gree with pride. That’s a good sign that the litter came from
well-planned breeding.
Do you like the breeder? Okay, maybe not for a best friend, but well
enough to call on if you need advice about health or training? Or
do you hope you never need to talk to the breeder again? If you
have a bad feeling about the breeder, the facility, or any of the
dogs, trust your intuition and look elsewhere for your puppy.
Oh gee, why the third degree?
All responsible breeders should grill you about your intentions and
your situation, so don’t be surprised or insulted when you’re asked
about your lifestyle. Instead, be glad you found a breeder who truly
cares about the puppies’ welfare. It all evens out in the end. After all,
you should be evaluating the breeder while he or she assesses you.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
48

Here are some of the questions many breeders are likely to ask
you, and why they want to know:
 What made you decide on a Chihuahua? The breeder is
making sure you chose the breed because you truly like Toy
dogs and especially Chihuahuas — not just because they’re
“stylish” or you think a little dog costs less to feed or is easier
for your 2-year-old to tote around.
 Have you had dogs before? What happened to them? Good
breeders want their puppies to have loving, permanent
homes. If you’ve never had a dog before, the breeder probably
wants to fill you in on the facts of dog ownership just to make
sure you know what you’re getting into. If you had a beloved
dog that eventually died of old age, the breeder will be happy
to sell you a puppy. But if your previous dog ran loose and 
got killed by a car or died of a disease that you could’ve pre-
vented, a responsible breeder won’t sell you a dog. Truthfully,
you don’t deserve one — unless you’ve learned from the
sorry saga and won’t let it happen again.
 What are your hours? How much time do you spend at
home? The breeder wants to be sure that the puppy will get
enough attention. Puppies must be fed and walked on a regu-
lar schedule to become housebroken (see Chapters 8 and 10).
 How old are your children? Are they gentle with animals?
Tots and Chihuahuas aren’t a good match. Toddlers are too
young and uncoordinated to safely handle small dogs, and
Chihuahuas are too tiny for rough handling. Teasing by young-
sters also turns nice dogs into holy terrors.
 Do you have a fenced yard? The breeder wants to make sure
your dog won’t be turned loose to be flattened by a car, mauled
by a bigger dog, or poisoned by eating something spoiled.
Although fenced-in yards make dog ownership easier, many
Chihuahua owners live in apartments or condos and exercise
their dogs by walking them on the leash (see Chapter 9).
 Is everyone in your family looking forward to getting a
Chihuahua? It isn’t fair to the Chihuahua if someone in the
family despises little dogs but was out-voted. A dog can sense
the disdain immediately; the person may go so far as to sabo-
tage the socialization or training.
 What do you expect from your Chihuahua? Tell the breeder
if you want a dog solely as a companion or if you also want to
show your dog. Will your Chihuahua live only with adults, or
do you have kids in the family? Will your dog live at home or
travel in your RV? Will you have your pet spayed or neutered,
or are you considering using the dog for breeding?
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 49

The more the breeder knows about your plans for the pup,
the better he or she can help you make a selection. After
all, the breeder has observed the litter since birth and knows
each puppy’s personality.
Pick of the litter
Gotta have the pick of the litter! But which one is it? Everyone
wants the pick of the litter, but it’s a different puppy for different
people:
To the show exhibitor, the pick is the puppy that comes clos-
est to the description of the ideal Chihuahua in the breed stan-
dard (see Chapter 2).
To the woman who lives alone in the city, the pick is the puppy
that alerts instantly to strange sounds.
To the young couple with kids in elementary school, the pick is
the largest and liveliest puppy.
To the retired couple in the condo, the pick is the quiet puppy
that loves to cuddle.
The truth is, the pick is the puppy that appeals to you — provided
that it’s healthy and has the right temperament to share your
lifestyle (see Figure 4-1). If you’re dealing with a show breeder 
but have no intention of showing, you don’t need the puppy the
breeder considers the pick of the litter. Chances are, the breeder
won’t sell it to you anyway! It’s destined to become a show dog and
possibly be the sire (father) or dam of the breeder’s next genera-
tion of champions. But one of its brothers or sisters may make you
the perfect pet.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
50
Small size doesn’t mean small price tag
Just because Chihuahuas are little, don’t expect the purchase price to be less than
what you’d pay for a larger dog. Chihuahuas have small litters, and the cost of breed-
ing them (including stud service and possibly a Caesarean section) is high. Raising
healthy, outgoing Toy dogs takes a lot of time and energy. You should expect a good
breeder to be happy with breaking even, though. They do it for love, not money.
When tempted to buy a bargain puppy, remember that the purchase price is only a
small part of what you’ll spend on your dog during her lifetime. It’s smarter to pay
more and get a dog that makes your heart sing. (For more on pricing and other
basics, refer to Chapter 1.)

Figure 4-1: Pick a puppy that appeals to you on first sight, but check its health
and disposition before making a purchase.
At the best kennels, show puppies and pet puppies come from the
same litters. In fact, the last choice in a top breeder’s litter may be
of higher quality than the first choice in a mediocre litter.
If you want to buy a show potential puppy, don’t be surprised if the
breeder insists on keeping it until it’s 6 months old. That’s per-
fectly normal. Why? Because it takes that long to be positive (well,
almost positive, anyway) that a puppy has what it takes to become
an AKC champion.
Whether you decide to pick out your own puppy or ask the
breeder for input, the following sections offer helpful suggestions
to guide you on the big day: puppy picking day!
Bring on all the puppies
You better have a plan when meeting the puppies, or canine Cupid
will sting you with an arrow. The following suggestions help you
choose a puppy with your head as well as your heart:
 Trust your instincts. Did one puppy catch your eye immedi-
ately? Do you keep going back to her even though you want to
give them all equal time? Are you already naming her in your
mind? First impressions are important when picking a puppy,
and love at first sight can last a lifetime. Just take the time to
make sure your furry favorite is healthy and has a pleasing
personality.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 51

 Be observant. Watch the puppies play together for several
minutes without human interference. (Chihuahua litters are
small, so you can probably observe two to four littermates
interacting with each other.) Your best bet is a puppy in the
middle of the pecking order — neither the bully nor the
scaredy-cat.
One sign of superior character is a puppy that stands up to
the bully and then goes on about her business peacefully.
 Eye the eyes. The puppy’s eyes need to be bright, alert, and
clear of mucous. Don’t mistake clear tears for mucous. Many
Chihuahuas (and other Toy breeds) have too-small tear ducts,
so tears occasionally fall from their eyes. A telltale sign is a
small water stain at the inner corner of each eye. This isn’t a
sign of sickness, but you shouldn’t convince yourself that the
stains will fade away as the puppy matures. More than likely,
the dog will always sport the tear stains, but they won’t affect
her health or happiness.
 Check the coat. Bald may be beautiful on my husband, but it’s
a bad sign on a puppy. A healthy coat is smooth to the touch
and glossy, with no bald patches. Smooth coats without an
undercoat may have thin hair on their temples and practically
bald bellies, but no puppy should have skin showing through
on its back or sides.
 Know the nose. The puppy’s breathing must be quiet and
rhythmic, and the nostrils should be free of mucous.
 Watch the puppies move when they play. Despite a bit of
baby clumsiness, puppies should appear quick, bouncy, and
agile. Puppies standing up straight on legs that look strong
enough to carry their bodies is a good sign.
 Check the teeth and running gear. If a show career is in your
puppy’s future, don’t forget to check her teeth for a scissors
bite (the upper-front teeth meet tightly outside the lower-front
teeth). And although it isn’t easy to do with a tiny puppy, try
to evaluate her gait (the way she moves at a trot) by watching
her move both straight toward you and directly away from
you. Front legs moving parallel with each other as she trots
toward you and rear legs moving parallel with each other as
she trots away are good signs. Study the breed standard (see
Chapter 2) before selecting a potential show dog.
If you want a show puppy but don’t have a clue how to select
one, take along someone who’s knowledgeable about show
dogs when you meet the puppies. Another option is making
absolutely sure that you’re dealing with a successful show
breeder and then letting him or her choose a puppy for you.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
52

When choosing your Chihuahua, avoid orphan puppies or litters of
only one, because hand-raised orphans and solo pups get every-
thing they want instantly. Consequently, they don’t learn how to
handle frustration or get along with other dogs. In general, puppies
that are raised by their dams (their mothers), along with at least
one littermate, make better companions.
One on one
After watching the litter play together, it’s time to meet your
favorites up close and personal. But first you need to know how to
hold a puppy. Novices often hold puppies high, with their back legs
dangling, but dogs hate being held that way. Instead, when lifting a
puppy (or an adult Chihuahua, for that matter), use both hands.
Place one hand under her chest and brace her bottom in your
other hand, and then cradle the puppy close to your body. Little
puppies are wiggly and a fall can be fatal, so keep your grip gentle
but firm. And don’t let your fingers push the pup’s elbows outward
or squeeze her front legs together, because either error could
damage the dog.
Never lift a puppy by its front legs. Not only is it painful, but it also
can cause permanent injury to the puppy’s shoulders.
Sit on the floor to play with the puppies during this first meeting.
You’ll enjoy it more because you won’t have to worry about drop-
ping a pup, and the breeder’s blood pressure will normalize.
Now you’re ready to see how well each puppy relates to people —
especially you. Follow these steps to meet your potential pups:
1. Ask if you can take your favorite puppy or puppies out of
sight (one puppy at a time) of the breeder, their dam, and
their littermates so you can test their temperaments.
Begin by giving each puppy at least two full minutes to
survey her surroundings (time it or you won’t wait long
enough). Watch her attitude while she explores. Is she 
curious or fearful? Lively or laid back?
2. Sit down and try coaxing the pup into coming to you.
When she does, praise her. Then get up, move away from
her slowly, and try talking her into following you. If she
does, that’s a good sign that she enjoys human company
and likes you just fine.
3. Show the puppy a small ball or other dog toy just the
right size for her, and roll it about 3 feet away from
(never toward) her.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 53

Does she seem interested? If she doesn’t respond right
away, that’s okay. It may take three or four tries before she
understands the game. Does she eventually chase or follow
the rolling toy and examine it when it stops moving? That’s
a good sign that she learns quickly, isn’t afraid to try new
things, and is willing to play on your team. If she picks up
the toy in her mouth and carries it part of the way back to
you, that’s even better.
4. Pick up the puppy and cradle her securely against your
body.
She should feel strong (for her size) and solid in your hand.
The puppy may struggle briefly, but she should soon relax
and enjoy the attention. After she loosens up, does she
sniff your hands, maybe even lick you? These are signs that
she has a good temperament and was well socialized by
the breeder.
5. Try a little TLC before giving up.
When you pick up the puppy and cradle her, does she
stiffen with fear or struggle nonstop? Neither reaction is
good, but don’t give up too soon. The puppy may just need
a little more time. Talk to her while stroking her soothingly.
Does that tight little body relax? Good. If not, she may have
missed out on early socialization. Pick another puppy.
No matter how super a puppy looks and tests, make sure some
chemistry exists between you. During your first couple months
together, both of you go through a period of adjustment. But a
Chihuahua that charms a smile out of you makes all the adjust-
ments seem minor.
Potential problem pups
Not every puppy will ace your tests from the previous sections.
Here are some signs that may warn you away from a pup:
 Don’t buy an unhealthy puppy. This could include a skinny
puppy or one with pimples or raw patches on its skin, exces-
sive dander, mucous seeping from the nostrils or the corner of
the eyes, or diarrhea.
 Please don’t purchase a puppy out of pity. When an active
litter of puppies vies for your attention but one hangs back or
hides in a corner, she isn’t an abused baby in need of comfort.
If the breeder neglected or mistreated the pups, every one of
them would shy away from people. The truth is, that puppy
has a temperament problem. Yes, she may improve a little
with time and a lot of socialization (see Chapter 9), but her
apprehensive attitude is probably a permanent problem.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
54

 Go for impy, not wimpy. Don’t pick a puppy that shies away
from its littermates’ games. I know it’s tempting to take home
a little underdog, but resist as hard as you can. Pups that
allow themselves to be terrorized by their littermates seldom
become confident pets.
 Avoid anxious Annie. Don’t buy a puppy that runs away or
crouches fearfully in one spot when you take her out of sight
of her breeder and four-legged family. It’s okay if it takes her a
couple minutes to get her bearings, but after a few moments,
expect her to show some interest in her surroundings and be
curious about you.
A puppy that tests well probably will make someone a wonderful
pet, but that someone may not be you. How do you feel when you
play with the pup? Is she the tiny soul mate you’ve been searching
for? Or are you thinking of buying her only because she tested well
and you’re tired of Chihuahua shopping? When tempted to think
that way, remember that you’re choosing family. Keep looking until
you know you’ve found your canine counterpart.
Meeting the extended family
When looking at a litter of puppies, ask to see their dam and any
other close relatives that live with the breeder. With luck, you may
get to meet the puppies’ grand-dam, a couple of aunts or uncles, or
even an older brother or sister from a previous litter. You may also
see the sire but don’t be disappointed if he lives far away from the
breeder. Good breeders find the best possible matches for their
brood bitches. No matter where the sire lives, a breeder will take
(or ship) his or her bitch to him and pay a fee (or possibly a
puppy) for his service. If the sire isn’t on the premises, the breeder
should be able to show you his pedigree and probably his picture.
A mature female dog is a bitch, no matter how sweet she is! And
when used for breeding, she’s a brood bitch. The mother of a litter
of puppies is the dam and the father is the sire.
The more of your potential puppy’s close relatives you meet, the
better. Why? Because their attitudes and appearances give you a
good indication of how the puppy may turn out. For example, does
the pup come from a friendly family? Or do its relatives aggres-
sively attack your ankles or cringe behind a couch in terror? Do
you find the family attractive? Or do most of the dogs have a trait
that you’d rather avoid?
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 55

Breeder contracts
Many good breeders will provide a breeder contract to buyers. The
contract spells out the conditions of the sale. The contract, and/or
a separate agreement, may include items such as the following:
 Whether the puppy is to be spayed or neutered
 Whether the puppy’s AKC registration will be full or limited
(see the final section of this chapter)
 How soon you should have the pup checked out by your vet-
erinarian to rule out genetic problems
 An explanation of the breeder’s responsibility if a genetic
problem turns up
 Whether you’re expected to exhibit the pup to her champi-
onship should she grow up show quality (if you buy a pup
with show potential)
 An explanation of the breeder’s responsibility if you plan on
showing your pup but she doesn’t become show quality at
maturity
Surveying Additional Places 
to Purchase a Puppy
Chihuahua puppies are frequently sold in pet shops and advertised
in the classifieds and online. In this section, I tell you why you
should proceed with extreme caution when you see a cute puppy
in a pet shop, and I discuss the possibilities you may encounter in
the classified ads.
As for online ads, they span every extreme. Top show kennels have
Web sites (see Chapter 17), but poorly bred specimens are also

an online ad, use the info I present earlier in this chapter to figure
out if you’ve found a good one.
What about pet shops?
Be wary about buying a puppy from pet shop. The darling “Doggie
in the Window” can cost you a small fortune if you run into heredi-
tary health problems, for instance.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
56

The pet shop itself usually isn’t the problem. The puppies in most
pet shops are clean and well nourished, have toys to keep them
occupied, and are petted often by the employees. The problem is
where they came from before arriving at the pet shop. You see,
good breeders plan matings carefully, breed to the standard,
socialize their puppies, and, after all that, want to check out every
potential puppy owner. But the people who sell puppies to pet
shops breed only to make money. They choose breeding partners
out of convenience rather than quality and willingly sell entire 
litters to middlemen without caring who ends up with the pups.
Sometimes their facilities are dirty, and they usually have far too
many dogs to give any of them individual attention. And that’s a
serious problem.
Lack of human attention early in life results in puppies that are
nervous and shy, and a dirty habitat during the formative weeks
can make the puppies hard to housebreak. Sure, time and affection
help, but the bottom line is this: No matter how hard you try, you
can’t cure bad breeding.
Dog lovers have a name for the over-crowded, filthy facilities that
breed litter after litter and sell hundreds of poorly bred puppies
every year. We call them puppy mills.
Classified canines
Should you check out the ads for Chihuahua puppies in your local
newspaper? That depends on what’s on your Chihuahua wish list.
With the right knowledge, you may find a nice pet through the clas-
sifieds, but don’t look there if you want a show dog.
Although both parents you see through a classified ad visit may be
healthy Chihuahuas with excellent dispositions, it’s better to have
plenty of knowledge about picking puppies before trying to select a
pet from the litter. See the section “Pick of the litter” for plenty of
advice on picking out the right puppy.
If you dream of owning a show champion, buying from an estab-
lished breeder is your best shot at success. Why? Because puppy
sellers who advertise only in the paper or online, and not through
the dog journals, probably bred their pets to their friends’ pooches
without studying the standard (see Chapter 2) or comparing 
pedigrees.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 57

The Ups and Downs of Choosing 
a Mature Chihuahua
After a brief period of adjustment, an adult Chihuahua bonds to a
new owner just as strongly as a puppy does. But why would you
want an adult dog? Maybe because even though puppies are pre-
cious, they’re also babies. And like infants, they’re sloppy eaters,
go potty often, and sleep a lot — but not always on your schedule.
They need constant supervision for several weeks, or else they
may teethe on the table legs and leave puddles (or worse) on the
carpet.
A mature dog may be easier on your schedule. And although not
every mature Chihuahua is housebroken, and unsupervised young
adults may still exercise their choppers on the chair legs, grown
dogs have bigger bladders and longer attention spans than pup-
pies, so they tend to learn the house rules rather quickly.
But isn’t acquiring an adult dog kind of like buying a used car? Isn’t
the adult just someone else’s problem looking for a new place to
happen? Maybe, but certainly not always.
Practically perfect adult dogs often find themselves homeless
because of factors out of their control — a divorce or death in
their families, family members’ allergic reactions to dog hair, or
owners moving and being unable to find proper housing, for
instance. Many breeders also won’t breed their bitches past a cer-
tain age and are happy to place them in loving homes. (And lost or
abandoned dogs often are available for adoption through a rescue
or humane organization. See Chapter 17 for more on Chihuahua
rescue organizations.)
You must beware of baggage, though. All adult dogs have a past, so
every member of the family should meet an adult Chihuahua
before a decision is made to buy or adopt it. That’s because some-
thing in its past may have caused it to love men but hate women
(or vice versa) or become defensive around children.
Selecting an adult Chihuahua is a lot like choosing a puppy but
without some of the guesswork, because her personality and
habits are already formed. Here are some tips to help you sift
through the problem pets and single out your future best friend:
 When meeting a mature Chihuahua, remember that you’re a
stranger and adult dogs are more discriminating than pup-
pies. Don’t force your attention on the dog. Instead, sit down
and talk to the owner for a few minutes until the dog warms
up to you.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
58

 Check for general good health by looking at the dog’s eyes,
nose, coat, skin, and movement. The eyes should be clear and
bright (not cloudy). The nose free of mucus. The coat should
cover the body with a healthy shine. The skin smooth and
supple, without bumps, lumps, or pimples. And movement
should be easy and animated — not stiff or labored.
 You and the dog need to appeal to each other. Give her time 
to accept you and then pet her if she allows it. Does she relax
and enjoy your company, or is she fearful or aggressive? Ask
the owner to place her on your lap. Is she content to cuddle?
Or is she scared stiff or frantic to escape?
 Ask if you may put a leash on the dog and take her for a walk.
Encourage her to walk beside you with soft, happy talk. Does
she trot down the street with you willingly, or does she freeze
in place, cry, balk, or try to make a break for home?
 Perform the smile test. Does looking at this dog make you
smile? That’s good chemistry, but it should work both ways.
After the dog knows you, does she wag her tail and dance a
few happy steps when you talk to her? Liking each other is the
most important criteria of all.
Many dogs are protective of their homes but warm up to friendly
strangers easily on neutral ground. Moving to a neutral site is
worth a try if you like everything about an adult Chihuahua but
she doesn’t seem to like you.
Understanding Pedigree
The word pedigree is often used incorrectly — especially in classi-
fied ads, where the term “pedigreed puppies” almost always means
purebred puppies. The truth is, every dog has a pedigree, whether
it’s purebred or not. Honest. A pedigree is nothing more than a list
of ancestors, just like a family tree. For example, one of your grand-
parents may be Hungarian, another Russian, another Irish, and so
on, but each one of them appears on your family tree. By the same
token, a mutt’s grandparents may be a Miniature Pinscher, a
Chihuahua, a Yorkshire Terrier, and a Toy Poodle, and that’s the
dog’s family tree. The dog has a pedigree, but it isn’t a purebred.
What is a purebred? It’s a dog that descended from dogs that were
all the same breed. A purebred Chihuahua has two Chihuahuas for
parents, four Chihuahuas for grandparents, eight Chihuahuas for
great-grandparents, and so on, as far back as records can be traced.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 59

Through studying pedigrees, you discover a lot more than just the
names of a dog’s ancestors. For example, if any of its ancestors
won a title, that shows up on the pedigree document. A good
breeder will provide you with a copy of your pup’s pedigree and
will be proud to decipher the titles for you — and with good
reason. The dog’s pedigree illustrates the beauty, trainability, 
and temperament of the dog’s ancestors.
The following sections dig deeper into the topics of registration
and pedigree.
Deciphering full or limited 
registration
The American Kennel Club (AKC) gives breeders the option of sell-
ing a puppy with either full or limited registration. A Chihuahua
with full registration, if bred to another Chihuahua with full regis-
tration, will have puppies that are eligible for AKC registration (full
or limited, depending on the breeder’s wishes). Dogs with limited
registration may be lovely to look at and delightful to live with
(and they usually are), but they should be spayed or neutered, not
bred. And if they are bred, their puppies aren’t eligible for AKC reg-
istration. Note: Dogs with limited registration may compete in AKC
(and other dog clubs’) obedience and agility events, but they’re
not eligible to compete in conformation (see Chapter 12).
If the puppy you fall for has been selected by the breeder for lim-
ited registration, ask why. Usually it’s because of some small fault
that won’t matter to you anyway unless you’re planning to show
and/or breed your dog. In fact, a puppy with limited registration
from an excellent breeder usually is far superior to a puppy with
full registration from a strictly commercial breeder.

Crossbreed fables abound
One fable about Chihuahua origins contends that the Chihuahua came from a cross
between a dog and a rodent in the desert surrounding Chihuahua, Mexico. Another
theory claims the Chihuahua evolved from a cross between the Techichi and a small
wild dog called the Perro Chihuahueno, which lived in the area now known as the
state of Chihuahua. And if that isn’t enough, a few historians think the Techichi may
have been crossed with a small hairless dog that was brought across the Bering
Strait from China to Alaska.

Registering your new dog
When you purchase a dog that’s AKC registrable, you should
receive a registration application that has been filled out and
signed by the seller. The form includes a section for the new owner
(congratulations, that’s you!) to complete. Do it ASAP (because the
price goes up if you wait too long) and send the application to the
American Kennel Club (the address is on the form), along with the
required fee. As soon as your dog’s paperwork is processed and
recorded, you’ll receive a registration certificate. Finally, you own
an AKC registered dog!
Thousands of eligible dogs aren’t registered even though their
owners think they are. That’s because their owners put the registra-
tion applications in a safe place but never read them. That official-
looking piece of paper is only an application. It means your dog is
eligible to be AKC registered. For the dog to actually be registered,
you must fill out the form and send it in.
One of the more important things you write on the registration
application is your dog’s name. Decide carefully, because after
your dog is AKC registered, the name stays the same forever!
Don’t be surprised if the breeder/kennel where you purchase your
Chihuahua wants to either name your puppy or include its kennel
name as part of your dog’s registered name. That isn’t an unusual
request. Breeding superior dogs is an art form, and putting a kennel
name on a top-quality dog is the same as an artist signing his or her
work. Most of the time, you and the breeder can get what you want.
For example, if you buy your dog from Talko Chi Town Kennels and
want to name her Susie, her registered name may be Talko Chi
Town Susie. In dog-show lingo, Susie is her call name.
If a seller doesn’t have a registration application for your puppy but
assures you that one is coming, proceed with caution. Maybe the
seller didn’t apply to the AKC soon enough and expects the paper-
work in a week or two. If you trust the seller enough to buy on that
basis, ask for a bill of sale signed by the seller that includes your
dog’s breed, date of birth, sex, color, the registered names and AKC
numbers of the pup’s sire and dam, and the full name and address
of the breeder. That way, if you don’t receive official paperwork in a
week or so, you can write to the AKC and fully identify your dog.
Don’t be shy about demanding the previous info. According to
American Kennel Club rules, anyone who sells dogs eligible for
AKC registration must provide complete identification in writing. If
you want a registered dog and the seller can’t give you the registra-
tion application or every bit of the necessary information, pass up
the puppy.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Ideal Chihuahua 61

Chihuahuas without credentials
If you adopt your Chihuahua from a rescue or humane organiza-
tion, she’ll probably come to you without papers. Does this
matter? Only if you want to compete in AKC events, such as 
obedience or agility (see Chapter 12).
The American Kennel Club allows purebred dogs with no papers 
to compete in obedience and agility if they have Indefinite Listing
Privilege (ILP) numbers. A form for you to fill out is available at
www.akc.org, or you can call AKC Customer Care at 919-233-9767
and ask a representative to send you an ILP form.

 Resisting the freedom fantasy
I
t’s almost dog day! You can feel the excitement in the air. I bet
you can hardly wait to bring your puppy home, but first, you
need to do a little organizing. This chapter helps you decide when
to bring your Chihuahua home and tells you how to keep his curi-
ous tongue out of toxic things. It also helps you decide what your
new dog needs and doesn’t need so you won’t be tempted to buy
every toy and food option in the pet shop!
Are you wondering how to handle your Chihuahua when he’s the
new dog on the block? How to guide your children or grandkids
into a good relationship with their new pal? How to introduce your
Pepe to your other pets? What you’ll do during those uncertain
first couple days? How you’ll keep your Chi safe and free from
escape temptation? Don’t worry. That’s all here, too.
Timing the Homecoming Just Right
The best time to bring home a new dog is when nothing new is
happening at your place. Wait until the repair people are finished,
the relatives have gone home, and the holiday season is over; this
gives your Chi quiet time to get to know you and adjust to his new
home.
If your Chihuahua is a holiday gift from your spouse to you or vice
versa, settle for a photo of him under the Christmas tree or beside
the Hanukah candles. If you have kids at home, gift-wrap a collar

and leash, a food and water dish, and dog toys to go with the
photo (see the later section “Shop till You Drop: Gathering the Chi
Goods”). Bring the dog home only after the parties are over and
the decorations have been boxed. A normal home has enough
gizmos to tempt a puppy into trouble. Halls decked out for the holi-
days can be downright dangerous.
Don’t ever give a dog as a present unless you’re absolutely sure the
recipient wants one and that the breed you picked is his or her
favorite. Better yet, before you pay for the pup, invite the potential
owner to meet him and check out the chemistry between them.
Dogs are social animals, so being alone in a strange place makes a
Chihuahua feel lonely and insecure. It’s better if you can bring him
home when you have a vacation or a long weekend so you can be
around to help him settle in. Is a regular weekend the best you can
do? Bring him home as early as possible on Saturday morning.
Don’t opt for Friday night, because bedtime without his dam
(mother) and littermates is the hardest time for a puppy, and 
he’ll feel better if he has a whole day to acclimate first.
Puppy-Proofing Your Chi’s Room
Until he’s housebroken (see Chapter 10), the right place for your
Chihuahua (when no one can supervise) is in one easily cleaned
room of your home. Most people find the kitchen ideal, unless yours
is exceptionally large. In that case, a bathroom may be suitable.
Your Chi’s room must be puppy-proofed for his safety. Puppies are
curious, and because they don’t have fingers to feel things, they
try to taste everything (no matter how yucky the things may smell
to you). Keep all cleaning agents, pesticides, antifreeze, and other
household and garden chemicals out of your puppy’s reach. Do the
same with electrical wires. If it isn’t possible to eliminate every
electrical cord your Chi can reach, coat them with a bitter spray
(found at pet stores). The spray is a safe, evil-tasting liquid, formu-
lated to prevent chewing.
Place a wire mesh baby gate across the doorway; this works better
than a solid door, which isolates the puppy, adding to his loneli-
ness and frustration, and leads to incessant barking, temper
tantrums, and tiny tooth prints in the door. Make sure the mesh is
strong enough to withstand sharp teeth and that the mesh pattern
is too small for him to chew through or get caught in.
If you can’t give your Chi the run of a whole puppy-proofed room, a
baby’s playpen with mesh sides is a good (and portable) alternative.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
64

Do you have houseplants? Identify every one (not just the ones in
the puppy-proofed room) and look them up to find out if they’re
poisonous (or take a leaf to a nursery and ask). Many popular
houseplants are deadly when ingested, including poinsettia leaves
and those merry mistletoe berries. Placing all plants, even the safe
ones, out of your dog’s reach is a good idea, because no puppy can
resist playing with a plant. But extra precautions are necessary
with the poisonous plants. They shed leaves and berries even
though they may be hanging high, and your Chi is bound to pick
them up. Your best course of action? Get rid of them.
If you like your nonpoisonous houseplants right where they are,
and you want your Chihuahua to know that he needs to leave them
alone, spray them with Bitter Apple leaf protector.
When young and unsupervised, your Chi will try to teethe on
everything he can reach, from your bedroom slippers to your
shower curtain . . . even a box of dishwasher detergent, if you 
leave the cupboard door ajar. But keeping his curious mouth out 
of mischief isn’t as hard as it sounds. You can secure closet and
cupboard doors and flip the shower curtain up over the rod, for
instance. After you have your dog for some time, these actions will
become second nature.
Shop till You Drop: Gathering 
the Chi Goods
You’ve puppy-proofed your Chi’s special room and your home, and
you have a long weekend coming up to welcome your new pet (see
the previous sections). You’ll be ready for Chihuahua life as soon
as you go shopping. Your Chi needs a few things right away.
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 65
A rock in a hard place
When my Chi Manchita was a puppy, she earned the nickname Hoover because
she behaved like a vacuum cleaner, inhaling everything in her path. One day while
we were out walking, she snatched up a small rock and swallowed it before I could
get it out of her mouth. The next day, she strained to eliminate, couldn’t pass the
rock, and became sick. Luckily, the veterinarian was able to dislodge it by med-
icating her at both ends. Otherwise, our 2 1⁄2 pound puppy faced emergency surgery!

Wait until you see the colorful display of dog toys, collars, leashes,
food and water dishes, and even canine clothing in the pet store.
It’s tempting to buy twice what you need. How will you know what’s
necessary and what isn’t? By using a shopping list. In this section I
explain each item so you can get the perfect one for your Chi.
Essentials for your new Chihuahua
The following shopping list contains the essentials you need for
your new Chihuahua:
 Two dishes — one for water and one for food
 Puppy (or dog) food
 Collar and leash
 Grooming equipment
 Three or four toys
 Dog crate
 Dog bed (optional)
 Warm sweater (if you live in a chilly climate)
 Pooper-scooper
 Identification
 An excellent veterinarian
Practical dishes
What’s a practical dog dish? One that’s easy to clean and hard 
to tip over. Some of the nicer dishes are made of stainless steel,
although acrylic, heavy-duty plastic, stoneware, and porcelain 
are good choices. Some dishes are wider at the bottom than at the
top and others are weighted; these are good features because it
makes them impossible to tip over, even if your Chi likes to play
with his bowl.
If you buy ceramic dishes for your Chihuahua, make sure they
were made in the United States. Some foreign glazes still contain
toxic stuff, including lead. Look for ceramics that are well glazed
(read: glossy).
Place your Chi’s dishes where they won’t slide around the floor
while he eats and drinks. A corner usually works well.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
66

Eating meals indoors is best for your Chihuahua, but if you decide
to give him an outdoor picnic on a pretty day, pick up his dish as
soon as he finishes. Otherwise, every bug in the neighborhood will
be attracted to your yard and the bowl.
So many choices: What 
should your Chi eat?
Kibble? Soft-moist? Biscuit? Pellets? Canned? Chopped or chunky?
Are you confused yet? Don’t be. Feeding your dog a good diet is
easy and mighty important . . . so important that it has its own
chapter in this book. So instead of giving Chihuahua chow your
best guess, turn to Chapter 6. It tells you what food to buy to meet
your Chi’s nutritional needs during every stage of his life.
A collar and leash
Wait until you bring your puppy home before buying a collar so
you can get one that fits his neck perfectly. Your Chihuahua’s collar
should apply no pressure as it encircles his neck, but it shouldn’t
be so loose that it slips over his adorable apple head. Don’t buy a
collar that’s too large so your puppy can grow into it, either.
Collars that are too loose are a choking hazard if they become
caught on something. 
Shop for a flat collar, made of nylon webbing or leather, that closes
via a buckle and has a D ring for attaching a leash. Some of the
newer nylon collars have a plastic clasp similar to those used on
camera bags and fanny packs (but in miniature form), and they
come in a variety of attractive designs.
Check the fit of your Chi’s collar weekly. Although he won’t grow
much, puppies do grow fast, and you must replace his collar right
away if it feels tight. It isn’t unusual for puppies to go through two
or three collars before they mature, so keep that in mind when
pricing puppy collars.
What’s a collar without a lead? Simply an accessory! The length of
your Chi’s lead should be between 5 and 6 feet. Leather, nylon, or
other flexible fabric leads are preferred. Expandable leads that
allow a dog to get several feet away from its owner also are avail-
able. They give dogs a feeling of freedom while still allowing
owners to maintain control, but they should be considered
optional. The traditional lead is still the safest choice in crowded
places. (To find out how to lead break your puppy, see Chapter 9.)
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 67

Don’t buy a leash or collar made of chain. Chain is too cumber-
some and can hurt your Chihuahua’s legs if he gets tangled in it.
And don’t buy any type of training collar (they also come in nylon
and webbing) with a ring at both ends that tightens up when you
or your dog pulls away. Commonly called choke collars, these train-
ing devices should be used during obedience training only (never
for everyday wear), and Toy dogs (like your Chi) don’t need them
at all.
Grooming gizmos
Smooth Chis have easy-care, wash-and-wear coats, so for their
grooming, you can get by with purchasing the following:
 A quality shampoo that’s pH-balanced for dogs
 A natural bristle brush
 A toothpaste formulated for dogs
 A soft toothbrush made for small dogs or human babies
 A doggie nail clipper
Other items like cotton ear swabs also are useful in grooming your
Chi, but you probably have most of them in your medicine cabinet
already.
Long-coated Chis are also easy to maintain, but they require a few
more things (in addition to the previous tools):
 Both you and your Chi will appreciate a coat conditioner for-
mulated for dogs. Besides making his coat a cinch to comb
after his shampoo, it will keep it soft and silky.
 A hard rubber comb is a must for keeping mats out of a Chi’s
coat — especially behind the ears.
 If you don’t use the comb often enough (don’t worry, it takes
only a minute or two), you’ll probably need a mat splitter to
put your Chi’s coat back in good condition.
Chapter 7 tells you how to use your grooming gizmos to keep your
dog’s skin and coat healthy.
Don’t buy a nylon or metal comb or a brush made with anything
but natural bristles. Natural products do the least damage to a
dog’s coat. If you comb your dog during the winter with a nylon or
metal implement, you’ll probably zap him with static electricity.
He’ll hate it and won’t want to be groomed anymore.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
68

Toys for Toys (Dogs, that is)
Think of your Chihuahua’s toys as essentials, not extras. He needs
something safe to gnaw on while he’s teething and a couple of toys
available to play with the rest of the time. Although your Chihuahua
continues chewing after he grows up, he won’t wrap his fangs
around everything he can reach the way teething puppies do. Be
glad your mature Chi still likes to chew (for example, see Figure 5-1).
Besides keeping him content, chewing promotes healthy gums and
teeth.
Toy dogs need chews and playthings that are small enough for
them to manipulate but big enough that they can’t swallow them.
Rawhide chew toys are a traditional favorite, but on rare occasions,
dogs have accidentally choked to death when pieces of rawhide 
got caught in their throats. You don’t have to boycott rawhide alto-
gether; instead, let your dog enjoy it when you’re with him and
replace it with something safer when you leave him unsupervised.
Figure 5-1: She may be pushing 12, but Manchita is still serious about her 
chew toys.
Chew toys made of hard nylon are safe in a Toy dog’s mouth even
when no one is home. Chihuahua puppies, and many adult dogs,
prefer the softer and equally safe gummy-nylon chews. Solid, hard-
rubber toys also are safe and fun.
On the other hand, squeaky toys (featherweight rubber or plastic
critters with squeakers inside) are popular with pups but are safe
only when you’re supervising — or better yet, when you join in the
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 69

fun. Squeaky toys are easily chewed open (yes, even by a
Chihuahua), and the squeaker inside is mighty dangerous when
swallowed. Like rawhide, you don’t have to deprive your Chi of a
squeaky toy. Instead, buy him one but keep it out of his reach. Get
it out once every few days as a special treat, and watch the fun
when he play-kills it.
Don’t use old leather shoes, purses, or wallets as dog toys. Sure,
your dog likes sinking his teeth into the well-worn leather, but this
teaches him that leather objects with your scent on them are chew
toys. That won’t do any of your new accessories any good.
Flat, fleecy toys (shaped like gingerbread people or other animals,
for instance) are popular, and dogs like cuddling up to them.
They’re machine washable and safe as long as your Chi doesn’t
shred the edges and swallow some of the material. Just keep an
eye on fleecy toys and throw them away if they ever become worn
enough to worry about.
Tug-of-war toys — such as ropes or thick bands of rubber with
loops at both ends — look like fun, but resist the temptation and
don’t buy them. Playing tug games with your dog teaches him that
fighting you for objects is a cool game. After he gets that in his
head, it won’t be long before he initiates a tug game by grabbing
and shaking the hem of your pants. Also, playing tug-of-war games
is known to cause aggression with dogs. Many behavioral issues
can be tracked back to these types of games. For plenty of safe and
fun games you can play with your Chihuahua, head to Chapter 8.
Don’t let your Chi have all his toys at once. Instead, put a few away
and rotate them every couple days. That way your dog won’t
become bored with his belongings. Keeping at least three toys (but
no more than five) in service at one time is a good rule of thumb.
Put one in his crate, one or two in his playroom (if he has one), and
one or two in the room where the family gathers. Although
indulging an older dog is okay, an overabundance of toys scattered
throughout the house may lead a puppy to believe that whatever
he can reach is his to chew.
A cozy crate
Dogs descend from denning animals that spent much of their time
in the relative security of their lairs, so it won’t take long before
your Chihuahua feels comfortable and protected in a dog crate.
Some new dog owners imagine that crate confinement is cruel, but
crates have saved dogs’ lives and owners’ tempers for decades.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
70

If you can’t give your Chi his own puppy-proofed room, a crate
becomes even more essential. It keeps him from stalking snakes
(that’s electrical cords to you) while you’re away. Because they’re
so curious, many dogs are bound to get into mischief (or danger)
when left at home alone. Besides, coming home to a safely crated
puppy is much nicer than coming home to teeth marks on table
legs and a soiled carpet. Because dogs don’t like to soil their beds,
a crate is a big help during housetraining. It also keeps your dog
out of trouble while you’re asleep. (For more info on introducing
your Chi to his crate and using it to housetrain, see Chapter 10.)
Buy your Chi a crate that’s only big enough for a full-grown
Chihuahua to stand up and turn around in comfortably. Bigger isn’t
better for two reasons:
 Chihuahuas enjoy the cozy comfort of a just-the-right-size den.
 A too-large crate loses its potty-training potential.
Most crates are made of wire or plastic (with a wire door). Both
types have their benefits, but I’d advise that plastic is the best
choice for smooth-coated Chihuahuas. The solid sides (except for
ventilation holes) keep a Chi draft free.
The inside of your Chihuahua’s crate is his private place within your
home, as well as his home away from home, so you should create a
comfortable den. Include bedding that’s easy to wash or change and
not dangerous if chewed or swallowed. An old twin-bed sheet works
nicely. If you don’t have one, you can use several thicknesses of
newspaper (black and white, not color or glossy like the comics or
ads). For extra coziness, rip one section into long, thin streamers
and place them in the crate on top of the whole sections (Chis love
having something to burrow under). When you’re sure that your Chi
can keep his crate clean (which doesn’t take long if you follow the
schedule in Chapter 10), you can give him a nicer “mattress.” A
fleecy crate pad or soft rug sample are two possibilities.
The best place to put your Chi’s crate is in his puppy-proofed room
(if you have one). When it comes to crate placement, caring for
your puppy works on the same principle as caring for a human
baby. Just visualize his puppy-proofed room as his nursery and his
crate as a combination crib, playpen, and car seat. Of course, you
may opt to use a real playpen or a made-for-dogs exercise pen in
addition to his crate.
For the ultimate crate toy, buy the smallest sterilized bone you can
find (available at many pet supply stores) and stuff it with cheese.
This concoction will keep your Chi occupied for hours.
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 71

For safety’s sake, always crate your Chihuahua when taking him for
a drive, and secure his crate so that it won’t slide or roll over
during turns or quick stops. A crated dog has a better chance of
surviving a car accident. Not only that, but you drive better with-
out your Chihuahua vying for your attention.
A snug bed
If a crate doesn’t satisfy your concept of interior design, you can
let your Chihuahua graduate into an attractive doggie bed after
he’s housebroken (see Chapters 9 and 10). Most beds are made of
wicker and come with a nice mattress. Be sure to place the bed in a
draft-free area and top it with a snugly blanket.
A useful sweater
Some canine couture is created just to look cute; fortunately, other
clothing actually serves a purpose. Because Chihuahuas chill
easily, your Chi may need a jacket or sweater that actually helps
him stay warm — some even need a sweater in an air-conditioned
room. Look for one that covers his chest, part of his neck, and as
much of his belly as possible (see Figure 5-2). If your Chi is a
female, the more of her bald belly the sweater covers, the better.
When fitting your male, remember that he’ll wear his sweater out-
doors when he goes potty, and you won’t want him to wet the
material. Most canine clothes are machine washable, but read the
labels just in case.

Pooper-scooper
Poop-scoops are available in a variety of styles at pet supply stores.
A scoop is convenient for cleaning up your yard and for cleaning up
after your Chi when you take him on walks. Most scoopers have
long handles so you don’t have to bend down to clean.
If you don’t mind bending down, you can get by without a pooper-
scooper. Instead, stock up on plastic sandwich bags. Put a couple
in your purse or pocket before walking your dog. Turn one inside
out for a quick pick-up, pull the mess back through to the proper
side, close the bag, and toss it in the nearest garbage can (not
someone’s recycle bin!).
A trusted veterinarian
Your Chihuahua’s veterinarian is his other best friend, so you need
to choose one before bringing him home. How will you know which
dog doc is best for your puppy? Check out Chapter 13, which
covers the details of the pet/vet relationship.
ID for dogs
You new dog should “carry” identification on him all the time. The
puppy ID can take the form of a tattoo, a microchip, or a collar 
tag. The best ID is a collar tag plus either a tattoo or a microchip.
Chapter 13 tells you all you need to know about identification and
its importance.
Surviving the First Two Days
Time to go! You have everything you need, and now it’s time to
pick up your Chihuahua! Get off to a smart start by taking your
crate along so your puppy can ride in it on the way home. The
crate is his safest sanctuary in a moving vehicle.
When you arrive home, give your Chi an opportunity to relieve him-
self outdoors before going in (see Chapter 10). Then take him to his
puppy-proofed room, give him fresh water in his dish, and let him
explore his room to his heart’s content (see the earlier section
“Puppy-Proofing Your Chi’s Room”). You’re not depriving him by
keeping him from investigating your whole home right away. Too
much new territory is confusing, and besides, if he’s teething and
isn’t housebroken yet, more space simply means more trouble. If
you don’t have a puppy-proofed room, keep a close eye on him as he
inspects his new digs. And use a crate when no one is supervising.
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 73

Make sure extra warmth is available whenever your Chihuahua
needs it. Whether you use a crate, playpen, a dog bed, or all these
options, his space needs to be equipped with a sheet or blanket
that he can burrow under.
After your Chi has a drink (and some food if it’s feeding time), take
him outdoors again. Then put him back in his puppy-proofed room,
give him a toy, and play with him quietly. No matter how excited
you are, this isn’t a good time to overstimulate your puppy.
Chances are, he’s tired from the trip home and seeing so many new
places and faces. When he gives out (some puppies go from play-
ing to sleeping so quickly that they appear to have passed out),
crate him or put him in his bed and let him take a nap. He’ll love
sleeping on your lap, of course, and it helps both of you bond, but
don’t put him on your lap for every nap. Your Chi has to learn to
sleep alone, too.
For the first couple days, try to keep household activity normal . . .
even low key. This isn’t the time for Junior to jam with his band 
or for Julie to invite her friends over to practice for cheerleading
tryouts. Don’t start your spring-cleaning, either. And remind 
enthusiastic family members and friends not to rush at your Chi.
Unfamiliar surroundings and strange voices are enough for a
puppy to get used to during the first 48 hours. After that, house-
hold activity can gradually return to normal.
Because consistency is the key when training a puppy, and
because your Chihuahua arrives full of curiosity with a brain like a
sponge, the ideal time to start housetraining is day one. See
Chapter 10 to find out how.
How to pick up your puppy
Sure, puppy Pepe fits into your palm; but you need to use two
hands to pick him up anyway, right from the get-go. One hand goes
under his chest and the other cups his rear. Check your hands the
first few times to make sure your fingers don’t apply pressure to his
front legs — either spreading them too far apart or squeezing them
together. Habitual spreading can cause permanent damage to your
puppy’s elbows, and repeated squeezing can harm the legs and
shoulders. Best bet? Place your thumb on one side of your dog and
your little finger on the other, supporting his chest with the middle
three fingers. After you try this method once or twice, it should
become automatic. Hold him gently but firmly (puppies wiggle)
against your body with both hands so no part of him dangles.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
74

Never leave your puppy alone in a place where he could fall. For
example, if you and your Chihuahua are watching television in the
recliner and you get up to check out the fridge, place your pup on
the floor until you return. When he matures, he becomes able to
jump on and off the furniture by himself, but that’s a dangerous
leap for a puppy.
Blending dogs and kids
Please don’t skip this section just because you don’t have any kids
at home. You may have grandchildren or friends with children, and
what you discover here will ensure that visiting kids and your Chi
will have pleasant (and safe) visits.
Chis and young children typically aren’t a good combination.
Sometimes kids and dogs scare each other without wanting to.
Tiny dogs fear shrill sounds and fast movements (especially
swooping down on them), and youngsters come well equipped
with high-pitched voices and jerky movements. When dogs feel
threatened or cornered, they usually growl, warning the offenders
away. But many young children don’t recognize the warning or
simply ignore it, and that’s how bites happen. On the other hand,
children fear shrill noises, too, and a Chihuahua’s piercing puppy
bark may make them cringe.
The truth is, kids and dogs can hurt each other. But many people
have surmounted the obstacles and succeeded in raising children
and Chihuahuas at the same time. How? By being vigilant and
never leaving little children and Chihuahuas alone together. Using
careful and calm supervision every time a child and puppy are
together keeps the child and the pup from fearing each other.
From about the age of 3 or 4, children — depending on their indi-
vidual self-control and emotional maturity — can help you care for
a Chi. Provided that you have patience and won’t freak out over
spilled food or water, kids can do many things, such as picking up
your Chi’s dirty dishes and bringing them to you and giving your
Chi his water or food after you fill the dishes. Kids also get a kick
out of giving dogs an occasional treat.
When children are young, helping to take care of a pet should be
fun — a privilege, not a responsibility. Do it yourself when you’re in
a hurry. Chubby little fingers sometimes spill stuff.
Children who are ready to help care for a puppy also are ready to
follow some simple rules. Here are a few rules that work on your
own kids and visitors, too; you may have to create others to fit
your situation:
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 75

 Always sit on the floor to play with the dog.
 Don’t put your face close to him.
 You may pet him, but don’t close your hand when doing so.
This keeps children from squeezing or grabbing a leg, ear, 
or tail.
 Don’t tease or poke the dog. You may have to explain what
teasing is.
 Never give him anything to eat or play with without permission.
 When he wants to leave, let him go. Don’t hang on and try to
stop him.
Matching older children 
and Chihuahuas
By the time they’re third- or fourth-graders, some kids become
attuned to animals. In fact, older children often have better rela-
tionships with their pets than grownups do because they take the
time to discover the animals’ body language. Responsible older
kids can share in your Chihuahua’s care by feeding, grooming, 
and walking him. And they may surprise you by teaching him a 
few tricks!
Kids learn the most valuable lessons about pet care when it’s a
family affair. Don’t expect a child (or teenager) to take full respon-
sibility for your Chi, even if she promised she would when she
begged you to buy him. Instead, give kids an excellent example
(yes, that’s you) to follow. Most important of all, never make
threatening remarks — “If you don’t do those dishes right now, 
I’m giving that dog away!” A dog isn’t a disposable object like out-
grown skates or a broken barrette. Yours deserves affection, care,
and a permanent home, and threatening to give him anything less
sends your child a sorry message.
No matter how good your children are with the family Chihuahua,
keep an eye on the situation when their friends visit. Other chil-
dren with little or no experience with tiny pets may want to experi-
ment (“What would happen if we fed him this?”) or may even
harbor a mean streak. And the best of kids (like yours) may find
themselves helpless in the face of peer pressure.
Introducing dog to dog
The best way to introduce Rover to your new Chihuahua is on neu-
tral ground so Rover doesn’t feel the need to defend his territory
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
76

from an intruder. Just half a block down the street does fine if both
dogs know how to walk on a leash. Your Chi must stand on the
ground (not in your arms) to participate in a proper doggie intro-
duction, so if he isn’t leash broken, borrow a fenced-in yard for the
opening ceremony.
The easiest way to accomplish a successful meeting is to ask a
helper to take your Chihuahua to the designated place. Then you
take Rover for a walk, on leash, and meet them there. Follow these
steps as you approach the meeting place:
1. As the dogs near each other, start a conversation with
your helper, but watch while the dogs go through the
motions of meeting.
2. Give Rover just enough slack in the lead so he can sniff
your Chi all over, but maintain complete control of the
situation.
Act nonchalant so the dogs don’t sense any anxiety in you,
and don’t pet either dog.
3. As soon as Rover displays gentleness toward your Chi,
praise him verbally.
In most cases, dogs will be civil — even friendly — to each
other. However, if Rover appears threatening or overly
excited, give an immediate jerk on the lead and walk away
with him. Try again when he simmers down.
4. When the dogs seem comfortable with each other, walk
them home together if both dogs walk on leash.
Otherwise, let your friend carry your Chi while you walk
Rover, praising him occasionally along the way.
5. When you get home, try to make Rover think that invit-
ing his little friend in was his idea by praising him by
name for being gentle (“Gooood Rover!”) and giving him
more than his share of attention.
6. Inside, put your Chi on the floor in the same room with
Rover and supervise closely.
Most dogs treat little puppies gently as long as they don’t
suddenly feel unloved. Give Rover at least as much atten-
tion as you ever did. Ignoring Rover creates the canine
equivalent of sibling rivalry. And if ol’ Rov is a big boy, the
situation may be dangerous. Just imagine how a 3-year-old
child would react to her new brother if she’s suddenly
shoved aside while the baby gets all the attention.
Chapter 5: Welcome Home, Little Amigo 77

Don’t leave the dogs alone together until you’re sure that they get
along. Use their crates, or keep them in different rooms, when no
one is home.
If you have more than one dog, introduce them to your new dog or
puppy one at a time. Start with your calmest canine and work up to
your most excitable.
Why cats get the last meow
Dogs and cats in the same household usually get along, and some
even become best buddies. At first introduction, if your Chi isn’t
especially agitated at the sight of Tabby, he may become curious
and try to sniff noses with her. If she sniffs back, that’s a good sign.
Chances are they’ll be friends in no time (see Figure 5-3). While
waiting for that to happen, keep a watchful eye on them when
they’re together. Some dogs, even little ones, have an undeniable
urge to chase cats. And although some cats run from Chihuahuas,
others may take swipes at the tiny tormentors, which can damage
your Chi’s eyes and nose.
When a dog and cat live together, the cat always has the advan-
tage. Why? Because Kitty can leave an area whenever she wants to.
All she has to do is jump on the bed or chair out of your Chi’s
reach, and he can’t annoy her or cuddle her until she decides to
come near him again. This may not seem fair to you, but don’t
interfere. When your cat has had enough of your Chi (even if that
happens in less than a second), let her go. You can’t force friend-
ship; it will probably occur on its own after Kitty gets used to the
interloper and they learn each other’s limits.
Living with furry, feathered, 
and scaled critters
Furry, feathered, and scaled caged pets — such as hamsters, birds,
rabbits, lizards, turtles, and mice — may appear to be prey to your
Chihuahua. Dogs (yes, even little ones) instinctively catch and kill
prey. The best solution is to keep these critters out of his reach
and correct everything from too much interest to a menacing growl
with a firm “No!” Your Chi doesn’t have to make friends with these
animals. You can rest easy when he learns to ignore them. Most
dogs lose interest in caged pets after they get used to seeing and
smelling them on a daily basis. But until then, supervise your Chi
every time he’s in the same room with your caged critters.

because cat food isn’t good for dogs.
Suppressing That Dangerous
Fantasy of Freedom
Some dog owners think their dogs somehow miss out on a facet of
life if they never experience absolute freedom. In fact, millions of
dogs die every year from accidents encountered while roaming
free. A loose dog can be crushed by cars or picked up by animal
control officers, or he can lick poisonous substances like antifreeze
(it’s sweet) or lawn herbicides.
Besides being a menace to your neighbor’s flowerbed, a loose
Chihuahua also faces dangers like being stolen, attacked by a
bigger dog, or even snatched by an owl or hawk (it happens). He
may also be handled roughly by a small child. And if the child
frightens or hurts your Chi, your dog may bite during his efforts 
to escape. Now you’re in danger of a lawsuit.
Putting your Chihuahua in a position to become a statistic isn’t
doing him a favor. A Chihuahua is more than a domestic animal —
he’s the ultimate house dog. Rather than freedom, give him what
he really wants: your companionship.

What’s on the Chi Menu?
In This Chapter
 Arranging the nuts and bolts of nutrition
 Giving food when you first get your Chihuahua
 Choosing between all those bags, boxes, and cans of dog food
 Feeding at different ages and stages of life
 Steering clear of the nutritional no-nos
Just look at the pet-food aisle at any major supermarket. It’s
stacked high with an array of kibble, meal, biscuit, semi-moist,
and canned canine cuisines — some for puppies, some for adult
dogs, and some for seniors. And they all claim to offer optimum
nutrition. That’s only the half of it. Pet supply stores stock several
high-priced but more-concentrated brands, and each proclaims its
advantages. Are you confused yet? You don’t have to be. Selecting
a healthy diet for your Chihuahua can be easy. In this chapter, I
help you choose the right meals for your Chi to feed her through
every stage of her life.
How Nutrients Work
If you understand human nutrition, you can skip this section.
Nutrients serve practically the same function in dogs as they do in
people, so you already know how your dog utilizes them. For those
of you who were daydreaming when your teachers talked about
the body’s building blocks, the following sections detail what some
of the more important nutrients do for your dog.
Building a healthy Chihuahua
Chihuahuas, and people, need a variety of nutrients to stay
healthy:

 Carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. They aid in
digestion and elimination and provide energy and the proper
assimilation of fats. Excess carbohydrates are stored in the
body for future use.
 Protein can come from meat or vegetable sources. It isn’t
stored in the body, so your dog needs to eat it every single
day. The body uses protein for bone growth, tissue healing,
and the daily replacement of body tissues burned up by
normal activity.
 Fats are necessary as an energy source. They also add supple-
ness to your dog’s skin and luster to her coat. However,
excess fat is stored under the skin and can lead to an over-
weight dog.
Fat balance is important. Too much fat leads to the same obe-
sity problems that humans suffer, and too little robs your
Chihuahua of necessary protection from changes in tempera-
ture and can make her overly sensitive to cold (as if she isn’t
sensitive enough to cold already!).
Vitamins and minerals
Humans need vitamins and minerals in their diet, and so do their
dogs. Here are some of the essentials and their roles in keeping
your Chihuahua healthy:
 The body uses vitamin A for fat absorption; it’s also necessary
for a healthy, shiny coat, for normal growth rate, good eye-
sight, and reproduction.
 The B vitamins protect the nervous system and are necessary
for normal coat, skin, appetite, growth, and vision.
 Dogs synthesize vitamin C in the liver, so this vitamin isn’t
often mentioned in an analysis of commercial dog food or vita-
min supplements. Some breeders add it to the diet anyway.
 Healthy bones and teeth and good muscle tone are dependent
on vitamin D, but the vitamin must be ingested in the correct
ratio with calcium and phosphorus.
 Vitamin E is associated with the proper functioning of the
muscles and the internal and reproductive organs.
 Most dogs can synthesize vitamin K in their digestive tracts,
and this vitamin is essential to normal clotting of the blood. 
If your Chi seems to bleed too long from minor cuts, mention
it to your veterinarian. This could indicate a deficiency of 
vitamin K.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
82

 A puppy’s body must receive calcium and phosphorus in the
correct ratio to provide protection from rickets, bowed legs,
and other bone deformities. They also aid in muscle develop-
ment and maintenance.
 Potassium is necessary for normal growth and healthy nerves
and muscles.
 Sodium and chlorine boost your Chihuahua’s appetite and
enable her to enjoy a normal activity level.
 Magnesium is necessary to prevent convulsions and nervous-
system disorders.
 Iron is needed for healthy blood and prevents fatigue from
anemia.
 Iodine prevents goiter in dogs the same way it does in people.
 Copper is necessary for growing and maintaining strong
bones. It also helps prevent anemia.
 Cobalt aids normal growth and keeps the reproductive tract
healthy.
 Manganese also aids growth and is necessary for healthy
reproduction.
 Zinc promotes normal growth and healthy skin.
Feeding for the First Few Days
The only right food to feed your Chihuahua for the first few days
after you bring her home is the one she was eating before you got
her. Even if your new Chihuahua is an adult, make only gradual
changes in her diet. She’s experiencing enough newness in her 
life right now. Many breeders give new owners a small amount 
of puppy or dog food and a written schedule to get them started,
but if your breeder offers you nothing, ask the following three
questions about your new dog’s eating habits:
 What brand of food has she been eating?
 What’s her feeding schedule (how frequently is she fed and at
what hours)?
 How much does she eat at each feeding?
Besides using the same food, sticking to the feeding schedule your
Chi is used to is best, at least for the first three days. After that,
you can gradually change food and chow time until her schedule
blends into your household routine.
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 83

Assuming you feed your Chihuahua in the kitchen, you may want
to put a carpet sample under her bowl. Many Chihuahuas (and
other dogs, too) like to eat on the rug. They accomplish this by
putting a few morsels in their mouths, trotting off to the closest
carpeted area, and then munching them there. If your Chi is deter-
mined to eat dinner on a comfy carpet, an area rug may (notice I’m
not promising anything) keep her in the kitchen.
Dogs are omnivores, which means they eat both meat and plant
matter.
How to change dog foods
What if you’ve decided on a dog food and it isn’t the one your new
Chi was raised on? No problem. After a few days of feeding her the
brand she’s used to, introduce the food you’ve selected by adding
just a little bit of it to her usual diet. Watch to make sure she eats it
and check her bowel movements. As long as everything is fine (no
constipation or diarrhea), add a little more of the new food and
take away a little more of her old food every day. You can complete
the transition by the end of a week as long as nothing appears
wrong.
If your dog becomes constipated (has to strain to eliminate) or
gets diarrhea, add more of the food your Chi was raised on and
less of the new food. When she normalizes, try gradually changing
her diet again by substituting a very small amount of the new food
daily. If problems persist, consult your vet. The problem may be
caused by something other than a change of food, and persistent
diarrhea is dangerous.
When to change dog 
foods (if you must)
Now that you know how to change dog foods, are you sure you
want to? Look at your Chi. Is her weight right for her height? Does
she have enough energy? Does her coat have a healthy glow? Gee,
her breeder must have done something right. As the old saying
goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” If she eats most of her meals
and has regular bowel movements, an upbeat attitude, and a
healthy coat, the best dog food for her (at least until she reaches
another stage in her life) may be exactly the one she’s eating. See
Figure 6-1 for an example of a healthy-looking, properly fed
Chihuahua.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
84

Figure 6-1: A glossy coat, bright eyes, and an alert attitude are signs that your
Chi is eating a healthy diet.
However, if your Chi is too thin or too fat, lacks energy, has a dull
or dry-looking coat, or suffers from constipation or diarrhea, see
your veterinarian. If he rules out parasites or an illness, consider
changing her dog food. You may also want to change her diet if the
one her breeder recommends is too time consuming to concoct.
Some breeders create their own formulas, and many of these for-
mulas are way too complicated for working pet owners. Besides,
quality commercial food is probably better for your dog in the long
run — provided that you opt for an excellent brand. The following
section helps you understand the countless choices you see on the
store shelves.
What You Need to Know about
Commercial Dog Food
Good nutrition is essential to prevent dietary deficiency diseases.
The right diet helps your Chihuahua fight off infections and
reduces her susceptibility to organic ailments. The best (and easi-
est) way to feed your dog a balanced diet — giving her the nutri-
tion she needs — is to choose an excellent commercial brand and
stick with it. (Always make sure fresh water is available, too.) The
following sections compare the many options available and help
you choose the right one for your situation. I also give you the 
lowdown on treats and other foods you can give your pup.
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 85

Beware of bargain brands
How about I start this section with the don’ts. As in, don’t buy a
bottom-of-the-line dog food for your Chihuahua. Bargain dog food
is seldom a bargain. The nutritional info on the package may say it
has the same percentages of protein (or other nutrients) as the
better-known brands, but the amount of usable (digestible) nutri-
ents is what’s important. For example, an old leather purse is pro-
tein but it has no nutritive value at all.
The truth is, generic and economy brands are made of the cheapest
ingredients available, and tests have found that many of them don’t
contain what their labels proclaim. In fact, many are downright 
dangerous for Toy breeds. Why? Because smaller dogs have higher
energy requirements per pound than large dogs, but because of
their size, they eat only a little at a time. Consequently, they need
high-quality, easily digestible dinners . . . not cheap, empty calories.
So many nutritional deficiencies have shown up in dogs fed a diet
of economy or generic foods that the Veterinary Medical Teaching
Hospital at the University of California, Davis, has labeled the syn-
drome generic dog food-associated disease. The common evidence
of the syndrome is abnormally slow growth, coat and skin prob-
lems, and skeletal abnormalities.
Regular brands versus 
premium brands
I tell you in the previous section not to go bargain hunting, but you
still must consider two other qualities of dog food — the regular
brands and the premium brands:
 The regular brands are the well-known names you’ve seen 
on supermarket shelves for years. Their ingredients are more
digestible and made from higher quality ingredients than 
the economy foods. Costwise, they’re the middle-of-the-road
brands — neither the cheapest nor the most expensive.
 The premium brands are the highest-priced dog foods, and
seldom are they seen in supermarkets. Instead, they’re sold 
at pet supply stores, pet shops, and some veterinarians’
offices. What sets them apart from the regular brands?
Regular brands usually use wheat, corn, or soybeans as their
primary ingredient, but many premium foods use a meat
source as their main ingredient. Likewise, because premium
foods contain only top-quality, highly digestible ingredients,
they’re considered concentrated. That means dogs eat less of
them and still get optimum nutrition.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
86

So even though they cost more, premium brands go further
than regular brands. Another advantage is that concentrated
food makes for smaller, more compact stools, giving you
easier cleanups. Of course, that’s more important to a St.
Bernard owner than it is to you, but I thought I should men-
tion it anyway.
I bet you think I’m going to tell you to run right out and buy a pre-
mium brand. But the choice isn’t that simple . . . at least not with
Toy dogs. Yes, I know you want the best for your Chihuahua, and
yes, premium food is the way to go if it agrees with her. But it may
not. If you try a premium brand for a few weeks and she starts to
show signs of constipation (straining to eliminate), gradually
change back to a grain-based brand. Some small dogs do best on
less-concentrated food and stay more regular when eating food
that contains corn. If your Chi is one of them, find a reputable
brand that keeps her bowels regular and stick with it. (For more on
foods formulated for different stages of a dog’s life, see the section
“Foods for Special Reasons.”)
The ingredients on a container of dog food are listed in descending
order, by weight. But just because chicken is the first ingredient
doesn’t mean the food is mostly chicken. The next four ingredients
may be wheat flour, corn meal, barley flour, and wheat germ. When
combined, the plant-based ingredients probably weigh a lot more
than the chicken.
Dry dog food
Dry dog food, sold in bags or boxes, is the most popular commercial-
style feed. Here are the pluses of dry food:
 It’s easy to feed and store.
 It has a decent shelf life (three to six months).
 It has little odor.
 It’s good for your dog’s teeth (when fed dry).
Now consider the minus side: Chihuahua puppies may not con-
sume enough dry dog food to meet their energy needs. They eat
larger servings when the nuggets are soaked and softened, but that
removes the teeth-cleaning benefit. Read the labels on dry food
carefully, because some are meant to be consumed dry, others
form gravy when moistened and are meant to be eaten slightly wet,
and still others may be consumed dry or moistened.
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 87

When choosing a dry food for your Chihuahua, check the size and
texture of the pieces before buying. A Chi prefers small pieces she
can easily chew as opposed to large, extra-hard chunks that make
it hard for her to close her little mouth.
Also, consider that the freshest food is the best food. After you
choose a brand of dry dog food, buy it in the smallest bag or box
you can find. As you get down toward the bottom of the bag, check
to make sure it still smells fresh, like biscuits, rather than stale or
moldy.
Canned dog food
The best canned foods are made mostly of meat products, have a
high moisture content, and usually contain some vegetable prod-
ucts, too. If you want to use canned food exclusively, read the label
on each candidate carefully. Some canned foods provide total
nutrition, but others are formulated to be mixed with dry food. If
the canned food alone provides every nutrient a dog needs, the
label says something like, “100 percent complete” or “Complete
dinner.”
Personally, I choose cans with complete nutrition even though I
mix the canned food with dry. Some brands provide a choice of
either chopped or chunky. The nutritional values are the same, 
but Chihuahua puppies, and most adult Chis, prefer the chopped
version.
The best thing about high-quality canned foods (those made
mostly of meat) is that dogs like them. In addition, they’re easily
stored, have long shelf lives, and some of the top brands for Toy
dogs are conveniently available in the supermarket.
The downside of canned dog food is that the best brands (the only
ones you want for your Chi) are expensive when compared to dry
food. They also have an unpleasant smell (to some people) and
won’t help scrape tartar from your dog’s teeth like dry foods do. 
In addition, you have to cover and store them in the refrigerator
after opening.
Semi-moist or soft-moist foods
As their name implies, the moisture content of semi-moist foods is
higher than that of dry food but less than canned. The result is dog
food with a chewy texture. The best thing about semi-moist food is
its convenience. It usually comes packaged in individual servings;
however, that helps owners of average-sized dogs more than it
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
88

helps you. Because the serving size is probably more than a
Chihuahua eats at one time, you still must put the leftovers in an
airtight bag so that they don’t dry out before her next meal.
Semi-moist foods are usually priced higher than dry food but lower
than quality canned dinners. Many dogs like semi-moist food, but
the reason they eat them so eagerly makes them a minus rather
than a plus in the nutrition department. The truth is, semi-moist
foods contain more sugar (or sweeteners such as corn syrup) than
your dog should eat. They often contain too much salt, as well, and
a variety of artificial colors and preservatives. In short, I don’t rec-
ommend semi-moist foods.
What’s the solution?
After you know a little about the popular types of dog food (see 
the previous sections), which one should you choose for your Chi?
Many long-time Chihuahua owners say their dogs do best when
they’re fed a diet of dry and canned food mixed together. A popular
ratio is 1⁄4th canned to 3⁄4ths dry, mixing well before serving.
A good-quality commercial food likely contains all the nutrition a
Chihuahua needs to glow with good health. The better brands of
commercial food are balanced, providing your dog with the best
canine nutrition known to modern science. That’s why they’re
healthier than anything you can create at home for twice the price.
The right balances of protein and carbohydrates, fats and fiber,
and vitamins and minerals are too important (and complicated) for
our guesstimates and are best left to the test kitchens of the major
dog food companies. Feeding a quality commercial food also pro-
tects puppies from the dangerous but all-too-human tendency to
believe that if a little of something is good, a lot is even better.
Nutrition doesn’t work that way; more of some substances actually
can be toxic.
For more advice on what to choose based on your Chihuahua’s
place in life, see the section “Foods for Special Reasons.”
Do you remember a Hill’s Pet Products commercial from back in
the early 1980s? It showed a guaranteed analysis just like the ones
displayed on dog food cans. Protein was listed at 10 percent, fat at
6.5 percent, fiber at 2.4 percent, and moisture at 68 percent — all
typical numbers for those nutrients. Finally, the ad displayed the
actual ingredients: eight worn-out, leather work shoes, a gallon of
used crankcase oil, a bucket of coal (crushed), and 68 pounds of
water. When analyzed, the items equaled the guaranteed analysis,
but imagine how much nutrition your Chihuahua receives from
such a concoction!
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 89

Loaves of frozen dog food are available in some locales. The best
ones have a high percentage of meat. Dogs like them, and they’re
stored in the freezer so they seldom spoil. Check the date on the
package before purchasing, and thaw your dog’s portion thor-
oughly before serving. You can use them alone or mix them with
dry food.
What about treats and table food?
The problem with giving your Chihuahua table scraps is that tiny
tummies can’t hold much food at a time, and no matter how nutri-
tious your dinner is for humans, chances are your dog’s food is
much better for her. Also, dogs that eat table scraps usually lose
their taste for dog food completely.
Don’t give your Chihuahua food directly from the table or she’ll
become an accomplished beggar. If you have healthy leftovers like
chicken or pot roast (not scraps like the fat you trimmed off your
steak), you can serve them mixed with your Chi’s dinner. First
chop or mash them well and then mix them in with her regular
ration. If you get lazy and leave them chunky, she’ll inhale them
first and walk away from the rest of her meal.
High-quality biscuits are good treats because they help scrape
tartar from a dog’s teeth. Just don’t give her too many. Most of
your dog’s calories should come from her regular meals. Many
companies make miniature dog biscuits just the right size for Toy
dogs. One company near me even offers dog cookies shaped like
tiny postmen!
Some dogs even enjoy an occasional cooked vegetable cut into
Chihuahua bite-sized pieces, such as carrots, yams, green beans,
or peas. Tiny digestive systems don’t do well with raw veggies, so
offer them only when they’re well cooked and have cooled to room
temperature. An occasional bit of hardboiled egg is good, too, but
raw eggs are a no-no. Treats that are good for training include tiny
pieces of cheese (provided that your dog isn’t lactose intolerant)
or chicken.
Many dogs love a bit of cheese for a treat, but some of them can’t
handle dairy products because of lactose intolerance. They suffer
from diarrhea and gas cramps (yep, you’ll suffer, too) when they
dine on dairy. The only way to find out if your dog can handle
cheese is to try it, so offer just a tiny tidbit at a time until you’re
sure that she can digest it without problems.

Foods for Special Reasons
Many of the major dog food companies offer special formulas (dry
or canned) for every stage of a dog’s life. And that’s a good thing.
Dogs have different nutritional requirements at different times, just
like people. The following sections break down the different stages
or options and their nutritional requirements.
Grub to grow on
Whether you choose dry food, canned food, or a combination of 
the two, your Chihuahua needs to eat a diet formulated for puppies
(often called a growth formula) until she’s 1 year old. Growth formu-
las contain more protein and fat than adult diets. Puppies need extra
protein for growth and extra fat to keep up with their energy levels.
Maintenance meals
After your Chi celebrates her 1st birthday, you can switch gradu-
ally to a commercial adult (maintenance) food (clearly labeled as
such). You can use it until she’s an oldster, provided that it keeps
her healthy inside and out. A poor coat usually is the first sign that
your dog’s diet is letting her down. And depending on her activity
level, you may want to adjust amounts a little bit over the years to
keep her from gaining or losing weight.
Provisions for performers
If you decide to enter your Chihuahua in dog shows or train her 
for high-energy events such as obedience or agility competitions
(see Chapter 12), consider feeding her a performance (sometimes
called stress) formula. Most performance foods have higher protein
and fat percentages than maintenance foods, making them similar
to puppy food. In fact, some exhibitors simply keep their dogs on
top-quality puppy food as long as they’re competing.
Low-calorie lunches
When it comes to weight issues, prevention is the best policy.
Make sure your Chihuahua exercises enough, eats a regular diet of
dog food (not table scraps), and doesn’t get a treat each and every
time she begs. If she starts getting pudgy anyway, a variety of
reduced-calorie dog foods are available to help her slim down.
Most of them contain lower percentages of protein and fat and
higher amounts of fiber than normal maintenance formulas.
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 91

Although the fiber helps your dog feel full on less food and a lower
fat content helps her lose weight, other weight-loss options usually
are healthier. The best option is increased exercise. If that doesn’t
do it, try feeding her a little less of her regular food at each feeding.
Start by giving her 90 percent of her normal ration for a month.
After that, if you don’t see any improvement, talk it over with your
veterinarian and consider a low-calorie cuisine.
Senior cuisine
Diets for geriatric dogs contain less protein than maintenance
foods, which may or may not be a good thing. If your Chi is a
healthy oldster, changing chow may not be necessary. But if she
suffers from an ailment such as kidney disease, your veterinarian
may recommend a senior formula because less protein puts less
stress on her kidneys. See the section “Supper for seniors” later in
this chapter for more on this topic.
Prescription dog food
If your Chihuahua has a specific health problem — such as dia-
betes, heart disease, renal failure, pancreatitis, or certain skin 
ailments — your veterinarian may prescribe a diet formulated
especially for dogs with that issue. Prescription diets are available
only through veterinarians, because the formulas are so different
that they aren’t good for healthy dogs. If your veterinarian puts
your Chi on a prescription diet, he or she wants to monitor her
progress — at least during the first few months.
Setting Puppy Feeding Schedules
Depending on your Chihuahua’s age at the time, her breeder proba-
bly fed her between three and five times a day. The younger and
tinier the puppy, the less she can eat at a time and the more often
she needs nutrition. As she grows older, she’ll chow down on larger
amounts at a time and therefore will need less frequent meals.
Most Chihuahua puppies need four meals a day when they move
into their permanent homes, but they won’t have to eat that often
forever. How do you know when to cut back to three feedings?
Easy: Your Chi will tell you. She’ll simply start ignoring all or most
of the food at one of her meals (usually when she’s around 3
months old). After she leaves most of one meal several days in a
row, cut out that feeding. Give her slightly larger portions than
before, but offer food only three times a day.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
92

At around 6 months old, your Chi will lose interest in another meal
(usually the middle one). Now it’s time to increase the portions
again and feed her only two meals a day, between 10 and 12 hours
apart. Many large dogs wolf down a big dinner once a day and do
just fine, but that doesn’t work with a little dog. A Chihuahua’s
energy requirements are big and her belly is small, and too much
elapsed time between meals can cause a dangerous drop in blood
sugar.
As a starting point, offer your puppy a minimum of half a cup of
food at every meal. If she finishes it quickly, licks her bowl, and
looks for more, you can increase the amount. No tried-and-true
rule exists for how much a puppy needs to eat, and appetites vary.
Your eyes are your best gauge. They tell you if your pup is gaining
or losing weight or staying just right.
Don’t let your Chi keep her food dish for longer than 15 minutes. If
she hasn’t finished her meal by then, remove it until the next feed-
ing. This will help her learn to eat when she’s fed.
Don’t try to teach your Chihuahua to clean her plate by giving her
the same stale meal at every feeding until she finishes it. That
won’t teach her to eat and may make her sick. A dog needs fresh
food in a clean bowl at every meal.
Filling a Mature Chi’s Belly
Adult Chihuahuas do best on twice-a-day feedings, but the meals
don’t have to be identical. After your dog is 1 year old, you may try
giving her dry food served dry in the morning (good for her gums
and teeth) and dry food slightly moistened and mixed with canned
food in the evening (or vice versa).
If you feed a healthy, parasite-free Chihuahua properly, she will
maintain the same weight month after month, along with bright
eyes, a shiny coat, healthy skin, steady nerves, and enough energy.
If something is missing from her diet, or if she consumes too many
calories, you’ll notice. Poor nutrition displays itself through coat
and skin problems and sometimes a lack of energy, and excess
calories lead to obesity.
Most Chihuahuas are good eaters. In fact, some Chihuahua owners
have to watch their pets’ weights to prevent obesity. Please don’t
let your Chihuahua get fat. It’s bad for her bones and organs.
Obesity does as much damage to dogs as it does to people. It’s a
major health problem in American dogs. In fact, it’s estimated that
nearly 50 percent of the dogs in the United States are overweight.
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 93

After you find a high-quality dog food that your dog enjoys and
obviously does well on, you have no reason to change. Your Chi
won’t get bored with the same food every day like you would and
doesn’t need to discover new shapes, colors, or sizes in her bowl
at frequent intervals.
Supper for seniors
When your Chi becomes a golden oldie (around age 10 or 11), 
try feeding her so she maintains the same weight she carried 
in healthy middle age. You can adjust the amounts, or even how 
the food is presented, to keep your senior Chi in top condition.
If she has less of an appetite than she used to, try tempting her
with a few easy options:
 For starters, warm up her food. That’s often all it takes to
stimulate an old dog’s appetite.
 Another option is treating her as though she’s in her second
puppyhood by feeding her small meals at frequent intervals.
 If that doesn’t help, try soaking her dry food until it softens,
which makes a difference when sore teeth or gums are the
problem.
 The final option is mashing tasty goodies, like boiled chicken,
cooked ground beef, or cottage cheese, into her regular dinner.
It’s only fair to tell you that special foods spoil your pet and
make her expect the same treatment at every meal! But then,
that isn’t so terrible. If your Chi is well into her teens, a little
spoiling may make both of you feel better.
Most breeds are considered seniors when they’re older than 7, but
because Chihuahuas are so long lived (usually well into their
teens), they aren’t oldsters until their ages reach double digits.
Supplements for adults
Supplementation may be a good idea at certain times in a
Chihuahua’s life. A dog may benefit from dietary supplements in
the following situations:
 Show dogs stressed from constant travel
 Performance dogs competing in obedience or agility events
 Dogs recuperating from illness or injury
 Dogs used for breeding
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
94

If you think your Chi needs a little extra help nutrition wise, check
with your veterinarian. He may recommend a prepared vitamin-
mineral powder or tablet, or simply suggest the addition of cottage
cheese, hard-boiled (never raw) eggs, or a little fat to her diet.
Over supplementation with vitamins and minerals can be 
dangerous — even toxic. Check with your veterinarian before
adding supplements to a balanced dog food.
Warning: Don’t Feed Your 
Dog Any of These Foods
The following list presents a rundown of forbidden foods for
Chihuahuas; some items may surprise you:
 Chocolate, onions, or any highly spiced, greasy, or salty
foods: Chocolate contains theobromine, a substance that’s
poisonous to dogs. Onions (raw or cooked) can also be toxic,
and spicy sauces and junk food lead to upset stomachs.
Children often want to share their treats with their pets;
unfortunately, their favorites usually include chocolate chip
cookies, brownies, and chocolate ice cream. You must let your
kids know that chocolate, in all forms (even icing), is off limits
to your Chihuahua.
 Bones: Chicken, turkey, and pork chop bones, for example,
can shatter and slice open your dog’s intestines. There is an
exception, however. Bones cooked in a pressure cooker until
they’re soft (it takes a long time at a high temperature) are
actually good for dogs.
 Beer, wine, or any other alcoholic beverage: Alcohol poison-
ing is deadly, and it doesn’t take much to poison a little dog.
Also, be careful not to leave leftover cocktails where your Chi
can find them.
 Grapes and raisins: These have been known to cause kidney
failure in dogs. The dogs become critically ill, and many die
even with aggressive treatment programs.
 Macadamia nuts: Some dogs have had serious reactions from
eating macadamia nuts.
 Cat food: Feed your cat out of your Chihuahua’s reach. Dogs
love cat food, but it contains more protein and fats than they
can handle.
Chapter 6: What’s on the Chi Menu? 95

 Spoiled or moldy stuff: Don’t even consider giving your dog
the leftover piece of chicken that you ignored for several days
in the fridge. And be careful that she doesn’t snatch it out of
the garbage. The bad food’s “enticing” odor will attract her. If
the food is too old for you to eat, it’s just as dangerous for her.
Of course, you wouldn’t even think of feeding your Chi any of the
following dangerous items, but I mention them because it’s impor-
tant to always keep them out of her reach:
 Baking power and baking soda: If you spill some, clean up
the mess before your Chi can lick it. These agents can cause
myriad problems in dogs, including congestive heart failure.
 Coffee grounds or coffee beans: These items can cause caf-
feine toxicity.
 Fruit seeds, pits, and stones: Fruit seeds contain cyanide,
which is poisonous to people and pets. Most people have 
the good sense not to eat them, but pets may consider them
chew toys.

Y
ou want some really good news? Less than five minutes of
daily grooming keeps your Chihuahua squeaky clean! But the
benefits of grooming go way beyond time considerations. Brushing,
for instance, helps his skin and coat stay healthy by stimulating
circulation and the secretion of natural oils. It also removes dirt,
dead hair, loose skin particles, and dandruff.
Grooming also makes a Chi more lovable. After all, whether his coat
is sporty smooth or luxuriously long, nice, clean hair is mighty
inviting for petting and hugging. No one likes to snuggle with a
smelly, matted dog that’s frantically scratching itself. Smelly! Not
your Pepe! Don’t worry. In this chapter, I talk about how just a few
minutes of your time can keep your Chihuahua’s coat enticing to
the touch. I also discuss how you can care for his ears, teeth, nails,
and eyes, and I finish up with a section on bathing your little guy.
Keeping the Shine in Your
Chihuahua’s Coat
Grooming your Chi’s coat daily is ideal, but if that isn’t possible,
make three times a week the bare minimum. Caring for his coat
gives you a chance to look for lumps and bruises, scratches and
skin infections, and for signs of external parasites like fleas and
ticks (see Chapter 14). Everything is easier to treat when discov-
ered early.

Although most ticks are easy to spot on a smooth’s sleek coat,
they’re a little harder to find on a long coat. Favorite hiding places
are in the ears, just behind the ears, between the toes, in the thick
neck hair, or in the rump area just before the tail. To uncover fleas,
rough your Chi’s coat in the opposite direction from the way it
grows. You may not see any of the minuscule pests move, but tiny
black specks on the skin will tell you that fleas are having a free
lunch courtesy of Pepe. If you see the telltale specks, ask your vet-
erinarian to recommend a treatment program (see Chapter 14) and
use the products exactly as recommended.
The following sections give you some general coat care advice, dis-
cuss grooming tables, and take you through the process of brush-
ing your Chi’s coat.
A Chihuahua’s coat grows in cycles. As it grows, it should look
glossy, but eventually it stops growing, dries out (doesn’t look
quite as shiny), and finally is shed. The cycle takes a little more
than one-third of a year, or about 130 days, but it varies consider-
ably between Chis. In fact, smooth coats shed some hair all the
time. Dogs that spend a lot of time outdoors always shed their
winter coats in the spring, but because Chis are house pets and
don’t always grow winter coats, they tend to shed on their own
personal schedule.
Early starts are best
How soon do you start grooming your pretty puppy? As soon as he
settles in — just a day or two after you get him (see Chapter 5).
Condition your Chihuahua from puppyhood to accept grooming as
a fact of life, and he’ll soon learn to like it. Talk to him softly at first
as you work on him (go on, tell him what a handsome fellow he is!).
If he becomes fidgety about being handled on any part of his body,
say “No!” sharply and firmly (but not loudly or in a threatening
tone) and continue grooming gently. Soon the sessions will become
routine.
If your pup is adamant about not wanting you to touch a certain part
of his body — his feet, for example — don’t force the issue. Instead,
use the peaceful ploy I present at the beginning of Chapter 9.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
98

Grooming tables
You can groom your Chihuahua on your lap or another surface
with traction if he cooperates (see Figure 7-1), but some Chi
owners prefer placing their dogs on grooming tables. Special tables
just for grooming are available through pet supply stores, at
booths at dog shows, or in animal supply catalogs. They even
come in small sizes for Toy dogs.
You can also create your own grooming table. Any tabletop does
well as long as it’s the right height for you to work on and stands
absolutely steady, without even a hint of a wobble. Provide traction
by attaching rubber matting to the top of the table. And never turn
your back when your dog is on the table — not even for an instant.
Brushing
Whether your Chi is a smooth or a long coat (see Chapter 2), you’ll
wear less of his hair and he’ll stay cleaner and need fewer baths if
you brush him regularly. Just before brushing, give him a full-body
massage. He’ll love it because it feels good, but it serves a functional
purpose, too: You’re actually stimulating his skin and examining him
from head to toe at the same time. Figure 7-1 shows a Chi undergo-
ing such an examination. Now you’re ready to brush.
The general brushing process
Grab a natural bristle brush for your brushing duties and then
follow these steps:
1. Place your dog so he faces away from you on your lap or
on a nonslip grooming table.
2. Start brushing his body against the lay of the hair, from
just in front of his tail to the top of his neck.
Giving a few strokes in the opposite direction of hair
growth is the quickest way to loosen his dead hair. Do the
same along each side.
3. Brush his back, sides, neck, and legs in the same direc-
tion as his hair grows.
Chapter 7: Grooming the Body Beautiful 99

Figure 7-1: During grooming, examine your dog from head to toe.
4. Gently turn him upside down in your lap or on the table
and brush his chest, belly, and the underside of his neck.
5. Place him right-side up and, if he’s a smooth coat, finish
by brushing his tail.
6. Praise him for being such a cooperative boy and give him
a treat!
That’s all there is to it unless today is teeth-cleaning or toenail-
trimming day. I tell you how to handle those procedures later in
this chapter.
Brushing a long coat
If your Chihuahua is a long coat, you need a rubber comb for the
finishing touches after you complete the general steps (see the
preceding section). With your Chi right-side up, comb his ear
fringe and the long hair on his legs (see Figure 7-2 for an example
of a groomer making her way to the legs). Be gentle, but make sure
you get all the way to the skin. Next, brush his tail and then comb
it. Simple as that — unless his coat is (horrors!) matted.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
100

Figure 7-2: Cindi Zablocki grooms her long coats outdoors during nice weather.
Chihuahua long coats have their own lingo. The hair on their legs
is called furnishings; the tail hair is a plume; and the fine hair falling
from their ears is called fringe.
Mats (balls of hair you can’t get a comb through) seldom occur on
a dog that’s groomed daily, but when they do, they usually show
up just behind the ears. (Of course, leg hair and tail hair is also
susceptible to matting.) You can loosen minor mats with your fin-
gers by separating each hair patiently until the mat is gone. An
implement called a mat splitter (available at pet supply stores) 
usually is necessary for major mats. The splitter loosens the mat
while removing the worst of it. Use it gently or it can hurt your
Chi’s skin and make him wary of grooming.
If you have a long-coated Chi that has gone ungroomed for too long,
your best bet is to take him to a professional groomer. The pro will
bathe your pup, remove the mats, trim his toenails — basically,
she’ll put your Chi’s coat back in shape so you can easily care for it
yourself.
Do your clothes and furniture look furry? Don’t blame poor Chi. All
that dead hair would be on your grooming brush rather than your
navy suit if you brushed him daily.
Chapter 7: Grooming the Body Beautiful 101

Ears Looking at You Chi!
Don’t forget your Chihuahua’s perky ears when giving him the
grooming once-over. Healthy ears are pinkish on the inside, and
their edges are smooth. They don’t have nicks, splits, or places
along the edge where the hair is stuck together as if smeared with
dark glue. When something is wrong, your nose may be the first to
know. That’s because nasty odors or discharges are early signs
that ear mites have set up camp. These pests live in the ear canal,
irritating your Chihuahua’s sensitive ears and producing a dry,
rusty-brown or black discharge.
Even if no unusual odor or discharge is present, suspect something
if your Chi paws at his ears, shakes his head, or stands with his
head unnaturally cocked to the side. Ear mites are easily banished,
and ear infections are quickly cured, when discovered early. As soon
as you see any of these signs of trouble, visit your veterinarian.
Are your dog’s ears driving you crazy because they’re erect one
day and flopped over the next? The ears may be all over the place
because he’s teething. A Chi’s ears generally stay up by the time
it’s 6 months old, but if your Chi’s ears are still hanging like a
hound dawg’s by the time he’s 8 months old, you may as well learn
to like it. They’re going to stay that way!
Keeping Those Pearlies White
According to the American Veterinary Medical Association
(AVMA), 80 percent of adult dogs develop gum disease by the time
they’re 3 years old. That is outrageous and unnecessary. If you
brush your Chihuahua’s teeth three or four times a week (no, I’m
not kidding), you can keep plaque under control.
If you can, start when your Chi is a puppy so he can become accus-
tomed to having his teeth brushed. For puppies and older Chis,
follow these steps to start down the road to a healthy mouth:
1. Begin by letting him get used to you lifting up his lips
and gently touching his teeth and gums with your finger.
The more matter-of-fact you are about it, the sooner he’ll
learn to live with it.
2. When he stops pulling away from your finger, introduce
him to a soft toothbrush; either the smallest one made for
dogs or one made for human babies.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
102

At first, just touch his teeth with it, but gradually apply a
little more pressure.
3. When he tolerates that, move the brush so it touches his
back teeth and gradually add pressure.
4. Finally, use a gentle up-and-down brushing motion all
around his mouth.
It won’t be long before you can clean all of his teeth with
relative ease.
Pet supply stores sell toothpaste and toothbrushes for dogs in a
variety of flavors; you may even find one that makes your pup look
forward to his brushings. But don’t count on it! If he hates all the
varieties you try, using plain warm water is better than no brush-
ing at all.
Never use a toothpaste meant for people on your Chihuahua. Adult
toothpaste is bad for dogs and probably upsets their stomachs.
At least once a year (twice is better), ask your vet to check your
Pepe for plaque or early signs of gum disease. A professional clean-
ing may be necessary if his teeth have been neglected for years.
The following sections dig a little deeper into a couple more oral
issues you should consider.
Removing retained puppy teeth
Dogs, just like people, have two sets of teeth during their lifetimes.
The puppy, or deciduous, teeth should all be gone by the time your
Chi is 6 or 7 months old, replaced by permanent teeth. But that
isn’t always what happens. Toy dogs often have a problem with
deciduous teeth refusing to fall out to make room for the emerging
permanent teeth. This creates havoc in a dog’s mouth. When per-
manent teeth can’t slip into their slots because baby teeth are block-
ing them, they grow in whatever direction they can. The result is a
mouthful of crowded teeth pointing every which way.
Now that you’re aware of the possibility, don’t let it happen to your
dog. Just by looking into his mouth, you can tell if a new tooth is
trying to emerge before a baby tooth falls out. Take him to your
veterinarian so she can remove the retained baby tooth so that the
permanent one can come in strong and straight.
Chapter 7: Grooming the Body Beautiful 103

Heeding the symptoms 
of gum disease
If your Chihuahua was an adult when you got him, he may already
have gum disease. The symptoms of gum disease are
 Bad breath
 Swollen, bright red, or bleeding gums
 Tartar against the gum line
 Loose or infected teeth
Sometimes dogs that appear to be finicky eaters actually are hungry,
but they have such sore mouths that they chew only enough to
survive. If your pup has any symptoms of gum disease, see your
veterinarian right away.
Most adult dogs have 42 permanent teeth, but Toy dogs, with their
tiny mouths, often have fewer than that.
Puppy-cure: Trimming the Toenails
A Chihuahua’s toenails are too long if they make clicking noises on
the floor when he walks or touch the ground when he stands still.
Dogs with long nails are forced to walk on the backs of their feet,
leading to splayed (that’s dog lingo for “spread”) toes and an awk-
ward gait. When untrimmed for months, toenails and dewclaws (the
higher, useless extra toenail that your dog may or may not have)
eventually curl under the foot, circling back to puncture the pads.
Are you wondering why wolves, coyotes, and even stray dogs trot
along just fine even though no one trims their toenails? In their
quest for food, these animals cover enough ground to wear down
their nails to a practical length — something that won’t occur
during Pepe’s stroll from the carpet to the tile.
Trim your dog’s toenails a minimum of once a month; once every
two weeks is better. My favorite type of toenail clipper for
Chihuahuas is the small, guillotine-style implement, although
others on the market work just fine.
Don’t trim your Chi’s toenails during the first week you have him.
Instead, get him used to having his feet touched first (see 
Chapter 9).
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
104

Some people use a grooming table when trimming nails (see the
section “Grooming tables” earlier in this chapter); others do the
clipping when their Chihuahuas are on their backs in their laps.
Pick the place and posture that works best for you and your dog,
and then follow these steps:
1. Start the job by lifting your Chi’s foot up and forward.
2. Hold his foot firmly but gently in your left hand so your
right hand can do the trimming (reverse this if you’re
left-handed).
3. Avoid cutting the quick by trimming the nail just outside
of the vein.
You won’t be able to see the quick in dark nails, so trim just
the tip of the nail, at the point where it starts curling down-
ward. If he has white or light nails, your job is easier because
the blood vessel inside each nail is easily seen through a
light-colored nail.
Trim his nails properly, and your Chi will feel nothing more than
slight pressure — the same as you feel when trimming your own
toenails. If you accidentally cut the quick, his nail hurts and bleeds.
Stop the bleeding with a styptic pencil made for people, or you can
use the styptic powder sold at pet supply stores. In an emergency,
pressing the bleeding nail into a soft bar of soap for a minute or so
also will stop the bleeding.
Without a doubt, a dog prefers prevention. Work under good light-
ing so you can cut his nails without a mishap. Your dog may forgive
a cut quick if it’s a rare occurrence; but if you hurt his toes often,
he’ll struggle and scream when you try to work on his feet.
Wouldn’t you?
Chihuahuas that are terrified of having their toenails trimmed
morph into monsters at the sight of a toenail clipper. If your Chi is
scared, it may take two people to accomplish the nail clip — one to
hold him and the other to wield the clipper. But remember, regard-
less of how frustrating the job becomes, no rough stuff. That tiny
leg you’re holding is breakable. If you can’t do the job safely at
home, don’t hesitate to take your Chi to the veterinarian or a pro-
fessional groomer for his trimmings.
Gazing into Your Chi’s Eyes
Oh, those big, beautiful eyes — the mirrors of a Chihuahua’s semi-
sweet soul. To keep them sparkling, all you have to do (most of
Chapter 7: Grooming the Body Beautiful 105

you, anyway) is occasionally wipe a bit of “sleep” out of the corners
with a clean, damp cloth.
Does your Chi have stains under his eyes that make him look like 
a woman leaving a tearjerker movie with mascara traces on her
cheeks? His stains are tearstains; but, trust me, your dog didn’t cry
when Leonardo died in Titanic. When a Chihuahua has tear ducts
that are too small, the overflow trickles down his face. To combat
the issue, wipe the area every morning with a soft cloth dipped
into distilled water (it becomes a habit like washing your own face).
Although no treatment for tiny tear ducts exists, check with your
veterinarian about the issue anyway. Some tearstains may be
caused by an infection called conjunctivitis; by entropian, a genetic
condition where the eyelashes turn in and rub the cornea; or by
ectropia, a condition where the lower eyelid sags and lets in foreign
matter. Your vet needs to check out the situation. The good news is
that these problems aren’t common in the Chihuahua.
If your Chi doesn’t have tearstains, his eyes won’t need any special
care unless he develops a problem (see Chapter 15). Just use
common sense in your day-to-day dealings. Don’t get shampoo in
his eyes (even the tear-free type); never spray insecticide near his
head; and don’t let him put his curious orbs out of the car window.
If a small stone hits him in the face while you’re driving, the conse-
quences can be tragic.
Bathing Your Beauty
Your Chihuahua seldom needs a bath if you brush him regularly
(see the section “Keeping the Shine in Your Chihuahua’s Coat”).
And that’s a good thing. Shampooing washes away the natural oils
that moisturize his coat and skin, so bathe your Chi only when 
necessary — no more than once a month, unless he rolls in some-
thing smelly. Actually, many experts say one bath every two months
is best. The following sections let you know what to bring to bath
time, how to execute the bath, and how to properly care for your
long-coated Chi.
The well-equipped bath
Gather up all your Chihuahua’s bathing equipment before you get
started so you won’t have to turn your eyes away from a soapy-
slick dog after you begin. Here’s what you need:
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
106

 Old clothes for you
When your pup shakes, you get wet, too!
 A tub, preferably with a drain, so your Chi won’t have to stand
in soapy water
Many Toy dog owners use the sink for baths, because it’s much
easier on the back (and you can use the spray tool). But if you
put your dog in the sink, don’t take your eyes or hands off him
for even an instant. A leap to the floor could be fatal.
 A rubber bath mat for traction in the tub or part of a rubber
mat to line the sink
 An unbreakable cup for dipping water or a spray hose 
attachment
 A pH-balanced dog shampoo, or insecticide shampoo or dip if
necessary
 Coat conditioner for dogs (this is optional but nice — 
especially for long coats)
 Cotton balls
 A washcloth
 Mineral oil
 A nice fluffy, terry-cloth towel (100-percent cotton)
Let’s get wet!
The following list presents the simple steps (or so I say) for bathing
your slick little Chi.
Wait! Before putting your Chihuahua into the tub or sink, take him
for a walk outside and give him time to relieve himself. Otherwise,
the excitement of bath time may make him want to or have to rush
outdoors immediately after his bath, which is a bad idea. He needs
to stay inside until he’s thoroughly dry, because Chis get chilled
easily.
1. Begin by placing a cotton ball inside each of your dog’s
ears (gently; don’t push it too far down) to keep the 
water out.
2. Spray or pour warm water (temperature test it on the
inside of your arm) over his whole body, with the excep-
tion of his face and head.
Massage him gently as you wet him, helping the water soak
in to the skin.
Chapter 7: Grooming the Body Beautiful 107

3. Put a few drops of shampoo on his back, spread it
around, and massage the lather into his coat.
Add a drop or two as needed to soap his legs, underbelly,
tail, and neck.
4. Now you’ve reached the most important part of the pro-
cedure: the rinse.
Never rush this step. If shampoo dries in his coat, he’ll itch
like crazy and you’ll rob his hair of its shine.
5. After the rinse, use coat conditioner (optional), following
the label directions and rinsing it out well.
6. After his body is rinsed, wet a washcloth in warm water,
wring it out well, and wipe his face and head.
7. Remove the cotton balls from his ears and clean each ear
gently (again, not too far down) with a fresh cotton ball
dipped in a tiny bit of mineral oil.
8. Wrap him in a towel and dry him thoroughly — from his
ear tips to his toes.
Pay special attention to his easily chilled chest and 
underbelly.
Finishing touches for your long coat
After towel drying your long coat, you need to finish the job with a
hand-held blow dryer. Don’t spend much time drying the same
spot, and don’t hold the dryer too close to his body, because the
hot air can burn a Chi’s coat and skin. Use the warm setting (if your
dryer has one) and blow his coat in the direction it grows — start-
ing at his neck and working toward his plume (yup, that’s the tail).
When long-coated Pepe is dry, brush him with a natural-bristle
brush. Then use a hard rubber comb on his ear fringe, furnishings
(the long hair on his legs), and plume. Wow! I bet he’s gorgeous.
And he knows it! Just watch him strut when you put him down.
Is the thick hair around your Chi’s anus often dirty? Use a pair of
sharp scissors and trim away just a little bit of hair from each side
of the anus and from just below it. That should keep it from becom-
ing soiled during bowel movements. Trim carefully so you don’t
break the skin.

In This Chapter
 Exercising and bonding with your Chi
 Teaching your petite player new games
 Seniorcizing with your mature dog
A
lthough Chihuahuas are small enough critters to get a good
workout in a one-room apartment, many become obese
because their owners don’t encourage them to be active. Poor
owners (and Chis). They don’t know how much fun they’re missing!
Sure, exercise is essential to your Chi’s health, but it can also be a
great bonding experience for you both — and tons of fun. Exercise
doesn’t have to feel like work. In this chapter, I tell you how to make
your Chihuahua’s bodybuilding breaks so much fun that you’ll find
yourself looking forward to them, too. I also include some advice
for exercising senior Chis, because they need activity, too!
Make Exercise a Happy Habit
Make exercise a habit for your Chi, even if its form changes from
day to day. Otherwise, your puppy may become the pudgy and
pooped type. If Chihuahuas were people, you’d find them in the
hammock on sunny summer days instead of hiking, canoeing, or
swimming. Many Chis become lazy while still young in life.
If your Chi leads a moderately active life, instead of becoming a
couch puppy, she’ll look much better and live longer. The muscles
rippling beneath her coat aren’t the only ones that exercise strength-
ens and tones. Her heart is almost entirely muscle, and even her
intestine contains muscle tissue. Regular exercise keeps a healthy
supply of blood circulating through these vital muscles. Chances
are, if your Chi gets enough exercise, she’ll behave better, too.
Simply giving a problem puppy more exercise cures countless
behavior problems!

What’s the best way to exercise a Chi? A brisk walk, an indoor
game, or playing with another Chihuahua all help keep her fit.
Note: Although your Chihuahua may play with a variety of small
dogs, most Chis prefer their own kind.
When it comes to exercise, though, variety is best. I know a profes-
sional trainer whose motto is, “Never let your body know what you
are going to make it do next.” According to her, if you get on an
exercise schedule and stick with it day after boring day, your body
gets so used to it that the workout stops being as beneficial as it
should be. Vary your regimen so your Chi’s body has to stay fit to
handle an assortment of activities. Now doesn’t that make exercis-
ing your Chi easy? You may try a walk around the block one day
(see Figure 8-1) and an indoor game the next. You can even exercise
her from your recliner (or lawn chair if you have a fenced yard)!
Organized activities like obedience and agility (see Chapter 12)
also provide exercise for dogs (and their owners).
Figure 8-1: When it comes to exercise, nothing 
beats a brisk walk.
Any form of exercise you and your Chi feel like doing is fine, as long
as it keeps her moving and isn’t too much for her. Too much? Yes,
you can overdo exercise with a tiny dog. Compare a Chihuahua’s
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
110

stride to the stride of a Labrador Retriever or other big dog. See
the difference? It isn’t that tiny dogs don’t need as much exercise
as big dogs — they do — but they can satisfy their exercise needs
in much less time, using much less space.
The next time you take your pup for a walk, notice how many
strides she takes to keep up with just one of yours. Sure, she can
do it, and it’s good for her, too, but within reason. If you stroll too
far, or the day is hot and humid, give her a rest in the shade and a
drink of water at the halfway point, or simply carry her home.
Although the type of exercise you give a Chihuahua isn’t important,
consistency is. She needs exercise in some form all her life. When
she’s young, your Manchita may help you invent games that pro-
vide excellent exercise. When she’s a senior, you may have to initi-
ate play. The following sections in this chapter dig deeper into
these topics.
Games You and Your 
Chihuahua Can Play
The time has come to introduce your sweet Chi to some fun games.
Some Chihuahua games are so much fun, you forget that their main
purpose is your Chi’s health! Most healthy, well-adjusted puppies
learn physical games in a jiffy, but adult dogs that have never played
take a lot longer to adjust. If your mature Chihuahua isn’t interested
in playing games after a week or two of opportunities, don’t give
up. First, check your attitude. Perhaps you’re trying too hard and
making it look like work rather than fun. Next, check your timing.
Was your Chi full from dinner or even sleeping when you tried to
excite her? A change of attitude or timing may be all it takes to turn
her into an avid game player (see Figure 8-2).
When playing games with your pup, treat her like the healthy
animal she is, but don’t overwhelm her with your physical superi-
ority. Because food is a reward in many games, play before her
mealtime so she wants to earn a tasty tidbit. Is she a little chunky?
Give her a smaller supper if she eats several treats during playtime.
The games I describe in the following sections are fun for Toy dogs
of all ages. Show your Chi how to play these games when you’re in
a good mood, and always stop playing before she wants to. No
matter how much fun a game is, it will feel like work if you keep at
it until she’s bored or tired. But if you quit while your Chihuahua is
still having fun, she’ll always be eager for the next round.
Chapter 8: Chirobics: For Fitness and Fun 111

Figure 8-2: Cricket’s owners encourage her 
to exercise by playing games with her and 
providing her with soft toys to play-kill.
Tile and other hard, slippery floor surfaces make maneuvering dif-
ficult for dogs. Exercise your Chi on flooring with good traction, on
the rug, or in the grass. And participate with her. Even if you have
a Chihuahua-safe fenced-in yard, putting your dog outside for an
hour or so during nice weather doesn’t guarantee her a good work-
out. Chihuahuas don’t like to exercise alone any more than most
people do. Indoors or out, a Chi won’t get active without a compan-
ion. And that companion is you, unless you have more than one dog!
Hide ’n seek
Some physical games are also educational for your Chi. Hide ’n seek
is one that may enhance your Chi’s memory and scenting ability.
Start playing hide-and-seek by following these steps:
1. Put your pup in another room and close the door.
2. Hide a treat in a different room, perhaps beside a table
leg or under a chair (the type she can easily walk under).
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
112

3. Open the door, and when she comes into the room, tell
her to “Find It” in an excited voice.
Of course, she won’t know what you mean at first, so keep
repeating the words while encouraging her toward the treat.
4. Help her locate the goodie, but let her make the actual
find.
In other words, she must pick up the treat from the floor,
not your hand. When she does, tell her “Goood Dooog”
(dogs love words with stretched out sounds) while she 
eats it — a double reward!
5. Put her back in the other room and place another treat
exactly where the first one was.
6. Open the door, say “Find It,” and watch what she does.
You’ll probably have to help her find the treat a few times
before she goes straight to it on her own.
7. When she succeeds by herself, repeat the game one more
time and then quit for the day. (No, that wasn’t enough
action to count as exercise, but later on this game gets
lively!)
8. Use the same hiding place for the next few days; soon,
she’ll race to the treat all by herself on the first try, with
you cheering her on, of course.
9. When she does, throw her a curve. Put the treat in a new
hiding place, farther from the starting point, and start
over by helping her find it.
Don’t tell her “No!” when she goes back to the original spot.
She’s finding out how to use her memory, and that’s good.
Instead, have a treat waiting in the old hiding place every
so often (once every five to ten times). Eventually, your Chi
will remember several rewarding locations (from one end
of the house to the other) and will sprint from room to
room until she finds her treats.
10. Continue adding new hiding places (after she’s familiar
with all the old ones) as long as she enjoys the game.
Chances are, she may start exercising her sense of smell as
well as her body and her memory.
Variations of hide ’n seek are easy to create. Adding a second
person, perhaps your spouse or child, is one way. Have the person
hide behind the drapes or in a closet with the door slightly ajar.
Instead of saying “Find It,” ask her “Where’s Tom?” Meanwhile,
Tom’s waiting to reward her with a treat.
Chapter 8: Chirobics: For Fitness and Fun 113

Catch ’n release
Make yourself a Chihuahua fishing rod and bait it to catch your
Chi! Use a piece of string about 5 or 6 feet long and tie one end of it
to a stick. Bait the other end by tying on a small stuffed animal or a
squeaky toy. Now sit down and start fishing. Puppies usually can’t
resist little twitches, but try a variety of “casts” to see what move-
ments attract your dog.
Read your dog and make adjustments for her temperament when
teaching and playing games. Some Chihuahuas love to hear you
clap and cheer and will play all the harder to keep excitement in
the air. Others tend to be more timid, and owners who double as
pro cheerleaders may spook them under their couches.
Munchkin in the middle
Munchkin in the middle takes two people and a rubber ball that’s
small enough for your Chihuahua to hold in her mouth but too big
for her to swallow. Use the ball only for playing games together,
and put it away when fun time is over.
To play the game, the partners sit on the floor facing each other,
with about 8 feet separating them. From this position, they roll the
ball back and forth. You may want to put on a show to entice your
Chi to join in at first, so laugh and act like scooping up the ball is a
really big deal. If your partner is a child, remind the youngster to
roll the ball gently so your Chi doesn’t shy away from it.
Manchita should get curious about all the fun on the floor and try
to intercept the ball. When she captures it, clap and cheer her on
for a few seconds while she parades her prize (many dogs strut
with pride when they capture a ball). Then say “Out,” take the ball
from her by trading it for a treat, and start the game over. Gradually
increase the distance between the partners so your Chi must run
farther when chasing the ball. Be sure to keep her interested by let-
ting her win sometimes (but not all the time!).
Fetching fun
Fetching (retrieving) games are favorites with some Chihuahuas,
but others have no interest in them at all. Any number of objects —
from sticks, to small balls, to miniature flying discs — are suitable
for fetching games, as long as their diameters and weights are 
compatible with a Chihuahua’s size.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
114

When rolling or tossing something to play fetch with your pup,
seeing it leave your hand is important for her — especially if she’s
a rookie. If she chases the object and brings it all the way back to
you, give her a treat and rejoice — she’s a natural! But if the more
likely scenario occurs — your Chi chases the object, picks it up,
and parades it triumphantly without bringing it back — attach a
long leash to her collar before the game begins (see Chapter 5 for
more on this equipment). After she chases and picks up the object,
you can gently reel her in while encouraging her in a happy tone.
When she brings the object all the way back to you, trade it for a
treat. If she drops it long before she reaches you, don’t give her
anything, but don’t be upset, either. Many Chihuahuas don’t have 
a strong retrieving instinct — but that doesn’t mean you should
give up. Keep trying occasionally, even if she shows no desire to
retrieve. Chis have been known to change their minds a time or two!
If your Chihuahua loves chasing the object but won’t retrieve it,
play ball with three or four balls at a time. Roll one in a straight
line. Roll the next one sideways so it rebounds off the wall. Toss
the next one so it bounces gently. You get the picture. Soon your
Chi will run in all directions.
Always roll the object away from (never toward) your Chi. You want
to awaken her chasing instinct, not spook her into thinking that a
strange object is heading for her. Make your tosses short at first,
and increase the distance gradually as she catches on.
Chapter 8: Chirobics: For Fitness and Fun 115
Tiny dogs running free in Aztec palaces!
During the 500 years that the Aztecs ruled Mexico, they had tiny dogs that were
pampered by the rich but ignored and sometimes even eaten (according to some
historians) by the poor. Montezuma II, last emperor of the Aztec nation, supposedly
kept hundreds of Chihuahuas’ ancestors running free in his palace to assure him
of a smooth journey after death. Another legend describes an Aztec princess who
kept more than a thousand tiny dogs, and each one had its own servant. When a dog
died, its servant was slain so he or she could take care of the dog in the next world.
The Techichi’s fortunes fell when the Conquistadors, led by Hernando Cortez, con-
quered the Aztec nation early in the 16th century. It’s said that the Spanish 
conquerors used the Indians’ pets and holy dogs for meat. In fact, some historians
believe the Conquistadors ate so many Techichis that the tiny dogs nearly became
extinct. And for the next 300 years, nothing much is known about Chihuahua 
history.

If retrieving excites your Chi, keep her in that state of mind by lim-
iting the number of times you play to four or five in a row, which is
plenty. After that, play something else. If she becomes a fetching
fanatic, add variations to the game by rolling the ball a little faster
and a lot farther; rolling it so it rebounds off a wall; or throwing it
(not hard) so it bounces (instead of rolls) away from her.
Note: If your Chi learns to fetch well — bringing her ball all the way
back to you every time — you’ll be able to exercise her the lazy
way: right from your recliner!
The word retriever is part of some dogs’ breed names. The Labrador
Retriever, the Golden Retriever, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, and
the Flat-Coated Retriever are just some of the breeds that are born
with the inclination to retrieve. And even they need training to
hone their natural talents!
Play-killing a critter
Play-killing a squeaky toy is good exercise, and most Chihuahuas
love this sport. If your Chi starts playing this game as a pup, she’ll
always get excited when you bring out her mousie, hedgehog, or
whatever critter she loves to “kill.” But if you acquired her as an
adult and she never learned to play, she may be clueless about
what to do with her new critter.
First, give your Chihuahua time to settle into her new home and
actively seek out your attention. When she begins to trust you, it’s
time to uncover her sense of humor. To do it, you need to set an
example by acting silly first (try it, you’ll like it!) and encouraging
her to follow suit.
Choose an exciting squeaky toy with plenty of appendages so her
small mouth can easily grip it. Play with the toy yourself while she
watches. Throw it, catch it, drop it, and chase it, amid plenty of
laughter. That should get her attention.
As she watches you enjoy the toy, occasionally, and only briefly,
tease her with it, but don’t give it to her. If another family member
joins in, you can roll the toy to each other, squeak it, and shake it —
but don’t get wild enough to frighten an insecure dog. After two or
three minutes of fun, “accidentally” drop the toy near her to see if
she shows interest in it. If she ignores it, pick it up and continue
playing for another minute. Then put the toy away until another day.
The first time your Chi takes the toy, allow her to play with it with-
out interference for about 20 seconds. At that point, trade it for a
treat, play with it yourself for a few seconds, and then put it away.
Part II: Fitting a Compact Canine into Your Life 
116

Soon, she’ll want a longer turn, so she’ll probably amuse you by
tossing and pouncing on the toy and shaking it as hard as she can.
Let her play huntress for awhile and then trade the toy for a treat
and put it away. Bring the toy out only for this special game, because
toys with squeakers aren’t suitable for everyday use.
It isn’t a good idea to play tug of war with your dog because it
teaches her to compete with you for ownership of objects. Not
cool when the object happens to be the cuff of your pants! And
dogs just don’t understand the difference between safe tug objects
and off-limits tug objects.
Exercising Your Super Senior
One of the wonderful things about dogs is that deep down inside,
they’ll always be puppies. They don’t outgrow their toys or become
too serious to act silly. Your dog needs exercise all her life. An old
dog may amble rather than trot, and that’s just fine. But most senior
Chihuahuas retain their sense of humor and their desire to partici-
pate in activities.
The same games puppies play appeal to Chihuahuas of all ages —
especially when a treat is involved. Many sassy seniors still play-
kill their mousies, and hide ’n seek is a perennial favorite. Watch
your golden oldie’s weight, though, and reduce the size of her
dinner if she already downed several treats.
Keep your mature Chi interested by varying the routine — a nice,
slightly-longer-than-usual walk one day and an indoor game the next.
Daily physical activity — even a mild activity such as walking —
will help keep your senior’s muscles strong and her weight down.
If your old dog suddenly ignores her favorite toy, refuses to play
the games she’s always loved, or doesn’t get excited about going
for a walk, see your veterinarian (see Chapter 13). Something may
be very wrong.

Y
ou can raise a puppy only once, so if you’re lucky enough to
have the opportunity, make the most of it. Socialization is a
very important aspect of bringing a dog into your home. It is, simply,
the responsible thing to do — for a new puppy or new adult. In this
chapter, I tell you how to bond with your Chihuahua, read her body
language, and help her gain confidence. You also find out how to
teach your Chi to walk on lead and safely introduce her to the world.
I even include a section on kindergarten puppy training, better
known as KPT. Both of you will have some mighty good times as
your little Manchita learns to share her Chi charm with an admir-
ing public.
Building a Bond with Your Chi
Bonding can be relaxing for both you and your Chi. Chihuahuas love
attention and body warmth, so holding your puppy in your lap is
one of the better ways to bond with her. And she won’t mind if you
read or watch television at the same time! While you’re holding
your dog, you can condition her to be tolerant of touch. If she lets
you handle every part of her body — from the tip of her nose to
the pads of her toes (see Figure 9-1) — it becomes easier to groom
and medicate her. Besides, all that touchy-feely stuff lowers your
blood pressure (honest, petting dogs does that).

Is your Chi sensitive about having her tootsies touched? Many pup-
pies are, but she’ll get over it if you deal with it right away. No,
don’t force the issue. Instead, pet your puppy in places she enjoys
until she’s nearly asleep. As she becomes limp, continue stroking
her body, but include her feet as well. If she tenses up, go back to
petting only her body until she’s sleepy enough that you can try
her feet again. After she falls asleep (and she will), gently massage
the toes of all four feet. Soon, your puppy will relax and let you
touch her toes when she’s awake, too, and that makes toenail trim-
ming much easier (see Chapter 7). If she resists being touched on
other parts of her body, use the same method to overcome those
aversions.
Be yourself around your new dog and incorporate her schedule
into your routine. If your pup is napping and you want to watch TV
or play the piano, do it. Your puppy can sleep through normal
household noises.

her toes.

Interpreting Body Language 
(And Preventing Anxiety)
Dogs may not talk (except on those amusing old Taco Bell commer-
cials and in movies), but if you pay attention to your Chi’s body
language, you soon find out how to read her needs and even pre-
dict her next moves. Your Chi communicates through her facial
expressions, using her ears, eyes, brows, lips, nose, and mouth.
She also talks through her tail, coat (hackles), and body position,
and she emits a variety of sounds.
Communicating with dogs comes naturally to many youngsters,
but adults need to concentrate on it because they seldom take
time to sit back and use their powers of observation. In fact, the
older people get, the more they rely on verbal communication and
lose their nonverbal skills. To give your Chi the best care, you need
to know her intimately. Sit back and study the differences in her
body language and facial expressions when she’s happy, curious,
anxious, proud of herself, and sleepy. Soon you’ll be able to read
your dog.
To start you off, here are some descriptions of general canine 
body language:
 A relaxed dog wags her tail in a methodical, neutral 
position — her tail isn’t high, tucked under, or stiff. Her
mouth may be slightly open, and her ears look relaxed 
(rather than fully alert). Her eyes appear soft, without a 
trace of threat or tension, and her weight is evenly 
distributed on all four legs.
 A dominant or aggressive dog tries to appear larger. She
stands absolutely erect, holds her tail either straight out or
up, and raises her hackles (the fur on top of her back). Her
mouth usually is closed, and she makes eye contact with her
adversary.
 A submissive, shy, or frightened dog makes herself smaller
by contracting her body. She tucks her tail, flattens her ears,
averts her eyes, and appears to shrink slightly.
 When a dog greets you with her rear end up, front end low,
a wagging tail, and lively eyes, she’s play-bowing. This is
dog language for “Let’s play.”
 If she flicks her tongue up to lick her nose over and over, a
dog is uneasy about something. Maybe she’s checking out
Chapter 9: Socializing Your Chihuahua 123

your new friend or concentrating hard to learn a new trick. In
some cases, tongue flicking precedes snapping.
 Mounting has more to do with dominance than sex. Does
your Chi ever mount another dog or stand on her hind legs
with her paws on another dog’s back? This is her way of
saying, “I’m top dog here, and don’t you forget it.”
Okay, the following sections take it from here by presenting more
behaviors and giving you more advice. And remember, although
the body language in the previous list is universal, your dog will
have many unique mannerisms all her own. Enjoy!
Understanding the “jitters”
A jittery dog acts frightened. You can recognize this behavior by
her tightly tucked tail, contracted body (to appear smaller), and
flattened ears. However, sometimes you won’t see her body because
she’ll be hiding behind your legs or the sofa. Chihuahuas often
shake all over when they’re scared, but shaking alone isn’t a good
indicator of fear. Chis also may shake from cold or even from
extreme happiness or excitement.
Some dogs are born nervous because of poor breeding, but most
scaredy-pups act jittery because they weren’t socialized at the
right time. If a dog isn’t socialized during its puppyhood, it never
becomes as confident a companion as it can be (see the following
section). You can understand an unsocialized dog’s jitters by look-
ing at the following scenario with a human child.
Imagine how a child (I’ll call him Bobby) would react on his first
day of school if he had been so overprotected by his parents that 
it was also his first experience away from home. Bobby’s anxiety
increases during the walk or drive to school. Traffic sounds startle
him, and the sight of so many strange buildings, vehicles, and
people confuses him. When he arrives, the big school building
intimidates him — especially if he doesn’t know how to navigate
stairs. In the classroom, Bobby’s fear of the strange adult called
Teacher keeps him from focusing on the lesson. On the playground,
he doesn’t know how to respond to his high-spirited classmates.
Feeling vulnerable and uncertain, he may back into a corner or
become defensive and try to fight off the first child who
approaches.
Here’s another bad scenario: What if Bobby went on two outings
before starting school? Both times, he visited his pediatrician for
vaccinations. In his mind, leaving home, entering a strange building,
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
124

and meeting a stranger all correlate to pain. Now Bobby can’t relax
or trust his teacher and consequently doesn’t learn. A classroom
observer who doesn’t know Bobby’s history probably labels him
as shy or stupid — perhaps even stubborn.
Luckily for children, scenarios like that seldom occur because
most parents take their kids out often. But puppies — especially
Toy breed puppies — don’t always have it so good. Some are
raised like poor Bobby.
Good breeders socialize their puppies before selling them; the best
refuse to sell a puppy before it’s 3 months old. And don’t worry.
Even though the puppy loves its breeder, it transfers that love to
you in no time. Besides, socialization is ongoing, and plenty of fun
stuff is left for you and your puppy to do. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss
socialization and buying from a good breeder. The rest of the sec-
tions in this chapter also dive deeper into dog socialization.
Using the first 16 weeks wisely
The first 16 weeks of your dog’s life are critical to her social devel-
opment. What a puppy discovers during that short time shapes
her personality — making her outgoing or shy, happy-go-lucky or
cautious. The brief time correlates to when wild animals explore
outside the den for the first time, quickly learning lessons in sur-
vival. Absorbing everything in a hurry is a necessity, because a 
cub that makes a mistake in the wild rarely gets a second chance.
Although domesticated for centuries, dogs still arrive in the world
programmed to relate to their surroundings during their first four
months. In an ideal situation, a pup finds out how to behave around
dogs during her first two months, which is why a good Chihuahua
breeder keeps a litter together until the puppies are at least 8 weeks
old. Between 8 weeks and 12 weeks, the youngsters become men-
tally mature enough to leave their canine family; this is the ideal
age to settle into human families. From then on, their people shape
their personalities.
If you’re lucky enough to acquire a Chi when she’s still a young
puppy (under 4 months old), you can help her establish (or keep)
an outgoing attitude. Introduce her to a friendly world and she’ll
grow up confident — a canine clown that shows off for your friends
and likes finding out new things. But if you keep her secluded,
she’ll begin to fear anything unusual.
Chapter 9: Socializing Your Chihuahua 125

It’s Party Time! Introducing 
Your Chi to Guests
Socializing has one big dilemma: Your Chi needs to meet plenty of
people before she’s 12 weeks old, but she’s prohibited from going
out in public places where she could encounter unvaccinated dogs
until her series of shots is complete (see Chapter 13), which usually
takes between 12 and 16 weeks. Breeders who keep their puppies
for three months or more have their own socializing programs, but
you may bring home a younger pup than that. No problem. The
solution is simple — and fun. Let your dog meet new people right
in your home by throwing a few puppy parties.
Introduce your Chi to men, women, and well-supervised children
by inviting a small group of friends over for dessert or a video.
Place a bowl of your pup’s dry food on the goodie table so your
friends can hand-feed her. Show your helpers how to hold a puppy
(see Chapter 5) and ask them to take turns holding, feeding, and
petting your pup.
Try to have several of informal get-togethers before your girl turns
12 weeks old, making sure you include men, women, and children
of various ages (supervised, of course).
Going for a short drive every so often keeps your dog from associ-
ating riding in the car with receiving a shot. Ask your dogless friends
or friends with well-behaved, healthy dogs if you and your puppy
can stop by for a few minutes. Investigating new places and meet-
ing new people is wonderful for your Chi, provided that there’s no
chance of contacting a doggie disease. By the time she’s vaccinated
and ready for real outings, she’ll feel secure around strangers and
comfortable in the car. In other words, she’ll be ready to experience
the world!
Leaving Home: Hello, World!
Every time your Chi meets someone new or leaves the house, she’s
socializing. Taking her with you when you visit a friend socializes
her. So does meeting someone while out for a walk, playing with
another puppy, or examining a beach ball.
The world is your Chi’s playground, so she needs to get out and
enjoy it as soon as she’s safely vaccinated (see Chapter 13). Few
people can pass up an adorable Chihuahua, and your pup benefits
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
126

from these admiring people. She needs to meet senior citizens and
gentle kids, bearded men and ladies in sun hats, teenagers carrying
skateboards, and people pushing strollers.
Never, ever let your Chihuahua run free outside — not even for a
second. Always put a leash on her when she’s outside the safety of
your home and fenced yard (see the later section “Walking on a
Lead”). And no matter how outgoing your Chi is or how well she
walks on a leash, always keep her in your arms when riding an ele-
vator. If it gives a sudden lurch or people rush on without watching
where they’re going, she can get stepped on.
While safely outside (in your arms or on a leash), your Chi gets used
to hearing motors, sirens, and the rumble of the garbage truck.
Whatever you do, though, don’t hold her all the time. She needs to
walk on grass and pavement and find out how to navigate stairs.
If your house doesn’t have steps, find some elsewhere and show
your dog how to manage them. Start by putting her on the third
step and encouraging her to come down to you. When she gets
good at that, place her at the bottom of the stairs, sit on the third
or fourth step, and encourage her to climb up to you.
The more people your Chi meets, the more she experiences, and
the more sights she sees before she’s 4 months old, the braver she
becomes. And confident Chihuahuas are the most fun of all. The
following sections explain how you can help your pup overcome
fear of the world and how you can take her to class to help with
your socialization efforts.
Helping your pup overcome fear
Think of socialization as a game with two rules:
1. Never pet your puppy when she’s afraid.
2. Always praise your puppy for being brave.
When your Chi appears scared you’ll want to comfort her, but
that’s a major mistake. Why? Because she interprets your pats and
soothing words as praise. Anything a puppy is praised for she’ll
repeat again and again, so cringing behind your legs can become
her learned reaction to anything new. On the other hand, never
jerk her toward an object she fears. Treatment like that can turn a
little trepidation into total terror.
Chapter 9: Socializing Your Chihuahua 127

Your Chi may be afraid of things in many different places. The fol-
lowing list gives you some tips for curbing your Chi’s fear in 
different areas:
 Objects in your home: What do you do if your pup is afraid to
investigate a new object in your house? Leave her where she
is and go yourself. Handle the object like it’s a winning lottery
ticket and invite her to join you. Sitting down beside the feared
object works especially well. Your puppy may start creeping
toward you (and it), but hold your praise until she touches
the thing with her nose. If the object isn’t breakable or too
large, roll it away from your puppy (never toward her). That
may awaken her chasing instinct and entice her to play with
the object.
 A friendly person: When your Chi fears a friendly person,
follow these steps to make an intro:
1. Give the person a dog treat and ask him or her to toss
it near your dog and then ignore her and chat with
you.
2. If your pup approaches, tell the person to kneel down
but not to reach for her.
3. When the dog gets close, the person holds his or her
hand low, reaching under the puppy’s chin to tickle
her chest.
Reaching over your Chi’s head may make her back away
in fright.
4. If she doesn’t approach the person, don’t force her,
but give her much more socialization.
Get many friends in on the act, and set up situations that
entice your Chi to approach people on her own.
 Loud noises: If loud noises send your Chi behind the sofa,
start announcing her favorite things with sound. For example,
if she’s an eager eater, mix her meal in a metal pan with a
metal spoon. Just keep the noise within the realm of everyday
life. The purpose is to help your pup handle her sound sensi-
tivity, not startle or terrify her.
Sudden Fear Syndrome
Between the age of 8 and 11 weeks, suddenly becoming afraid of
anything new isn’t unusual for happy-go-lucky puppies. In fact, that
behavior has a name — Sudden Fear Syndrome. If your Chi sud-
denly starts spooking, remember the rules of socialization: Don’t
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
128

try to cuddle her out of it, and praise her profusely when (and if)
she does something brave.
Don’t be surprised if your pup shies away from something as silly
as a fire hydrant. During her fear phase, she may see the bogeyman
everywhere. Although this isn’t the time to take her to a Fourth of
July celebration, it’s best to keep taking her on regular outings. If
you don’t force her toward something she fears or soothe her silli-
ness, the fear phase passes.
Attending kindergarten for puppies
What’s more fun than watching a puppy play? Watching several
puppies frolic together and then your Chi being invited to join in.
This treat awaits you after your dog has been immunized and can
safely attend puppy kindergarten.
When your puppy is between 4 and 6 months old, she’s fully devel-
oped mentally but not physically or emotionally, and she hasn’t yet
achieved an adult attention span. Often called KPT (Kindergarten
Puppy Training) and geared to puppies between 12 and 16 weeks
of age (some rules may vary), kindergarten classes usually run once
a week for eight weeks. KPT classes provide excellent socialization
by helping owners introduce their pups to people, places, things,
and each other.
In addition to socialization, KPT prepares dogs for further educa-
tion. Gentle training techniques encourage them to earn praise for
a job well done and to learn respect for the word “No.” Depending
on the instructors, pups may also be introduced to basic com-
mands such as Come, Sit, and Down (see Chapter 10), and may be
taught how to walk on a leash.
KPT isn’t just for puppies; it’s for people, too. Instructors give advice
on housetraining and answer questions about dog behavior. By the
end of the course, you’ll know how to solve minor problems before
they become major issues.
To find a puppy kindergarten near you, check your local news-
paper or yellow pages for kennel clubs or dog obedience schools.
Some of these places offer puppy programs. You also can check
with your veterinarian for recommendations.
Before enrolling your Chi in any class, talk to the teacher. Find out
if he or she is experienced with Toy dogs, and inquire about safety
protocol. For example, if the instructor turns puppies loose to play
together, you want to make sure your Chi’s group is composed
only of other small pups.
Chapter 9: Socializing Your Chihuahua 129

Also, use your head when choosing playmates and play groups.
Puppies don’t know their own strength (although playing with other
puppies helps them learn it). Don’t overwhelm your 10-week-old
Chihuahua by putting her with an 8-week-old Rottweiler. Instead,
try to find other small puppies for her to play with. Sure, most pup-
pies will probably be bigger than your Chi, but Chihuahua puppies
can hold their own with other small-breed puppies of similar ages.
Walking on a Lead
If I were asked to list the mistakes Toy-breed owners make most
often, teaching their dogs how to walk on a lead too late would def-
initely be near the top. It’s so easy to carry a tiny dog that some
people just don’t get around to lead training. That never happens
with a Great Dane!
Some breeders teach their puppies to walk on a leash before sell-
ing them. If your Chi willingly walks with you, you don’t have to
read the rest of this section. Instead, snap on her leash, step out-
side, and enjoy!
If your Chi doesn’t know how to walk on lead, though, and isn’t
used to her collar or harness (see Chapter 5), follow these steps:
1. Put the collar on her and play with her. Is she a
chowhound? Put the collar on her just before meals and let
her wear it a little longer each time. After a few days, she’ll
ignore it.
2. When your Chi is accustomed to her collar, attach the
lead and let her drag it around. Keep an eye on her so 
she doesn’t catch it on something and start struggling.
3. When she’s nonchalant about dragging the leash (or if
she’s too busy playing with it to drag it), pick up your 
end and follow your pup wherever she takes you.
When leash-breaking a Chihuahua puppy, five minutes a
day is enough, and more than ten minutes is too much.
4. When she’s comfortable with her collar and leash in the
house (this may take a few days), put a few of her favorite
treats in your pocket and carry her outside wearing her
leash. If you live in a crowded city, save leash-breaking for
early on a weekend morning or for whenever the fewest
people are out rushing around.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
130

5. Carry her about a quarter-block away from the house,
put her down, and walk her home (it’ll probably take
plenty of verbal encouragement and a few treats). If she
pulls and rears like a baby bucking horse, wait until her
tantrum subsides and try again.
Keeping the experience a positive one is important, so
ignore the rebellion and praise her when she walks with
you (out in front, following behind, or beside you are all
okay). Just watch your timing. Be sure to give her a treat
when she’s moving with you, not when she’s balking like a
belligerent mule.
Does your Chi scream and turn herself inside out in a ploy
to make you remove her leash? Just stay calm and keep
trying. Whatever you do, don’t give in and decide to put off
training until she’s older. When she’s older, she’ll be more
set in her ways and will throw bigger tantrums.
6. After she begins to walk home with you rather well, put
gentle pressure on the leash to decide the direction both
of you will go. Instead of stopping in front of your house,
continue past it for a few steps, encouraging her all the
way. Gradually show her how to walk both toward and
away from home. More important, keep your sessions
short and upbeat.
Does your Chi cough when you put the slightest pressure
on the lead? She may have a collapsing trachea (see
Chapter 15). Consult your vet. You can relieve that problem
by having her wear a harness rather than a collar.
Socializing an Adult Dog
Oh no! People, including me in the previous sections, keep telling
you how important it is to socialize a dog early, and you didn’t
even acquire your Chi until she was an adult. Worse yet, you think
terrible things may have happened to her before you got her. Is it
too late to socialize? Is your Chihuahua doomed to be insecure for
the rest of her life?
No way. Dogs don’t have to have ideal puppyhoods to become con-
tented companions. Life may have been unkind to your Chi, but
just look how her luck has changed! She has you now, and the rest
of her life is ahead of her. Help her make the most of it by giving
her training, not pity. Pity prevents progress.
Chapter 9: Socializing Your Chihuahua 131

To become a well-adjusted family member, your adult Chi needs
self-confidence. You can help her find it. How? Show her how to
please you. Begin with the basics (see Chapter 10) and then join a
novice obedience class (see Chapter 11). You can use the com-
mands during daily life and praise your Chi for every correct
response — not by rote, but with feeling. Gradually, she’ll gain
enough confidence to stop avoiding life and start enjoying it.

D
o you know why Toy dogs have a bad reputation for being
yappy, hard to housetrain, and possessive? Because so many
owners let little pets get away with rudeness. I’m sure glad you’re
not one of those owners. How do I know? Because you’re reading
about manners right here! After you train your Chihuahua with the
tactics I present in this chapter, he’ll become a good ambassador
for this bright breed.
In this chapter, I help you raise your Chi to be a polite pup. You dis-
cover how to housetrain him — including crate training — introduce
him to simple commands, and nip problem behavior in the bud
before it becomes nasty habit. Not only will your dog love the 
positive attention that comes with training, but his well-behaved
nature also will make him welcome in many more places. And
going places together is one of the best parts of having a canine
companion.
Dog training methods go in and out of style almost as often as hem-
lines, but the positive motivation method that’s so popular today
has always been my favorite. Positive motivation works because
dogs adore attention, and they’ll perform encore after encore of
any act that elicits your positive interest. Catching your dog doing
something right and then praising him for it is the crux of positive
training. See how many good habits you can instill in your Chi
through praise, petting, and good timing.

Never punish your Chi for something he did when you weren’t
supervising. He won’t know why he’s being punished, which leads
to all sorts of anxiety problems. If you didn’t catch him in the act,
let it pass. Keep it from happening again by using prevention, not
punishment.
Making the Crate a Home Base
Besides serving as your pup’s private den and his home away from
home, your Chi’s crate is your best housetraining tool. But before
you teach him his bathroom manners, you should teach your Chi
to accept, and even enjoy, being crated. Here are some simple
steps to follow:
1. Every time you put your dog in his crate, toss a favorite
toy or special treat into the crate ahead of him.
2. Say “Crate” or “Kennel up” and gently, but firmly, put
him inside and shut the door.
3. Now walk away. Don’t wait around to see how he
responds, because that entices him to react.
It won’t be long before your Chi learns what “Crate” means
and enters his little den on his own.
Your Chi may cry the first few times he’s introduced to his crate,
but if you leave the room and don’t retrieve him until he settles
down, he’ll soon learn to relax in it. The worst thing you can do is
rescue him when he cries, because that teaches him to control you
by whining and howling. If he still complains in his crate after a
week or two, head to Chapter 11 for help.
At night, make sure your pup relieves himself before you crate him
and then put his crate in your bedroom, right beside your bed. No,
a young dog won’t make it through the night, but he should be
okay for three or four hours. If he cries in his crate as soon as the
lights go out, sing or whistle soothingly to him (to let him know
that someone is near), but don’t take him out of the crate. The first
few nights are the hardest on him (and you), because your place
won’t feel like home yet. A young pup is used to snuggling with his
mother and littermates, and he misses them most during the wee
hours. Be prepared to lose some sleep.
Eventually, your dog will fall asleep and so will you, but expect him
to wake you with his cries after a few hours. Like it or not, you
must get up quickly and take your puppy outside to relieve him-
self. Dogs don’t like to soil their sleeping quarters, which is why a
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
134

crate is such a good housetraining aid. But if you ignore his plea to
go potty, he’ll have to soil his crate. Puppies just don’t have much
holding power. If crate accidents happen too often, he’ll adjust to
living with filth instead of maintaining the clean habits he was 
born with.
Never use the crate to punish your dog, and be careful not to use it
too much. Your dog doesn’t need to spend the majority of his time
in a crate. How do you know if you’re doing it right? Watch his
reaction as he matures. Eventually, his attitude toward his crate
should become neutral. If he either resists going into it or loves it
so much that it’s hard to get him out of it, something is wrong.
When your Chi matures, you may want to leave a crate in a corner
of your living room with the door always open. He may appreciate
a private place of his own where he can chew a toy or take a nap
when he needs one. Let your kids and friends know that when he
curls up in his crate, he’s tired and wants to be left alone.
Housetraining — 
Avoiding Problems
Dogs are naturally clean critters, yet having accidents in the house
is considered one of the biggest behavior problems in the Toy
breeds. However, Toy dogs have an undeserved bad reputation
when it comes to housetraining. The truth is, Toy dogs are every
bit as bright as larger breeds (okay, often brighter), and they can
control themselves just as well as big dogs. Thousands of Toys are
extremely reliable in the home, and yours can be one of them — if
you follow the guidelines in this chapter. Here I show you how to
avoid the problems in the house and housetrain your Chi from 
the start.
Even if you’re lucky enough to get your puppy while you’re on
vacation, you should introduce him to a schedule you can live with
and stick to it (see Chapter 5). Don’t confuse him by putting him
on one schedule during weekends and vacation days and another
on workdays.
Common Toy dog misconceptions
Do Toy dogs have poor plumbing systems? Not at all. Toy dogs are
considered hard to housetrain because so many owners don’t get
around to training until their dogs have already developed bad
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 135

habits. Then they face the enormous job of breaking the habits
rather than the much easier task of establishing good ones. Here’s
why Toy dog owners let their puppies get away with leaving pud-
dles and poops on the floor:
 Because the accident is so tiny that it can be cleaned up
quickly
 Because the dog is so small, he probably doesn’t understand
 Because he hates to get his feet wet and it’s drizzling outside
 Because no one in the house feels ambitious enough at the
time to walk the dog
People love to give those excuses when letting their little dogs do
it on the floor just one more time. Bet they wouldn’t think that way
if a Saint Bernard just did his duty on the floor!
To clear your head of that kind of thinking, remember the following:
 The accident may be easy to clean, but do you want to clean
up accidents several times a day for the next dozen or more
years?
 Being small isn’t the same as being stupid. Chihuahuas are
smart. Your dog will understand if you take the time to 
teach him.
 Toy dogs are still dogs, and yours needs to learn to relieve
himself in the right place, rain or shine. Most dogs do their
duty real fast during bad weather.
 To housetrain a dog, you must train yourself.
Your Chi may take longer to be reliably housebroken than a big dog
because Toy dogs see the world differently than large dogs do. 
As far as they’re concerned, it’s a long way from the kitchen to
behind the living room sofa, so they can squat there and still con-
sider themselves clean critters. Keep your dog close to you until
he understands exactly where he’s supposed to go potty (see the
later section “Keeping to a routine”). And keep in mind that Toy
dogs have to relieve themselves a little more often than large dogs.
Never train your pet when you’re in a bad mood. Puppies are just
learning how to learn, and your earliest teachings color their life-
long attitude toward training.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
136

Keeping to a routine
The keys to housetraining are a regular routine and an alert trainer
(that’s you!). A housebroken dog is simply a dog with a habit — the
happy habit of eliminating outdoors.
Simply put, you need to feed (see Chapter 6), water, exercise (see
Chapter 8), groom (see Chapter 7), and take your dog outside to
eliminate at the same times every day. Besides being healthier, a
routine makes housetraining easier. Dogs are creatures of habit, so
sticking to a schedule from day one helps your Chi make sense of
his new environment. As he begins to recognize his daily routine,
he’ll learn to understand your expectations. And because puppies
love to please, the habits he forms will be good ones.
When housetraining your Chi, take him to the same outdoor area
to go potty every time, and repeat the same words — “Go Potty”
for instance — as he eliminates. Routine is so important, so taking
the same route to the potty place every time is a good idea (for
example, go out the same door and turn the same direction).
If you live on the 20th floor of a building or in a place where the
snow drifts as high as a Chihuahua’s eye, you can try the litter-box
method of training. Instead of using cat-box filler, line the box with
several thicknesses of newspaper. Use the same housetraining rou-
tines I recommend in this chapter, but when I tell you to take your
dog outside, take him to the litter box instead. Soon your Chi will
be litter-box trained. Pet shops also sell chemically treated pads
that attract dogs and entice them to squat in the area you choose.
Chihuahuas are naturally clean dogs and don’t want to soil their
living quarters. When housetraining your Chi and establishing a 
routine, take advantage of that trait by confining him to a dog crate
every time you’re away or he’s left unsupervised. Then as soon as
you arrive home, take him outside and praise him for eliminating. 
If he soils his crate, clean up the mess immediately. Besides being
dangerous to his health, a wet or dirty crate teaches your Chi to live
with his mess — an attitude that hinders the housetraining process.
Training yourself, a.m. to p.m.
Staying on a schedule makes or breaks housetraining, so plan ahead.
To adjust to housetraining your Chi, you may need to get up 15
minutes earlier; come home for lunch (or hire a dog walker); and
come straight home from work until your pup is a little older. The
following sections present a tentative schedule to keep with young
puppy.
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 137

Morning
1. First thing in the morning, take your Chi outside for several
minutes and praise him for a job well done.
2. When you bring him in, feed and water him (see Chapter 6
for tips).
3. Take him outside again after he eats breakfast. Young dogs
almost always have to relieve themselves soon after eating.
4. Now he can spend time with you to exercise or have the
run of a puppy-proofed room if you’re at home but unable
to supervise. If you’re leaving for work, confine him to 
his crate.
5. Take him outdoors for elimination midmorning if you’re 
at home.
Afternoon
1. Take your Chi outside as soon as you get home at lunchtime.
2. Give him lunch and fresh water.
3. Take him outdoors after he finishes eating. Confine him
again if you can’t keep an eye on him or must leave.
Evening
1. When you arrive home, take your Chi outdoors right away
and enjoy a nice walk (weather permitting).
2. When you get back, let him watch you fix dinner or join you
for the evening news.
3. Feed him for the last time each day between 6 p.m. and 
7 p.m.
4. Take him outside after he finishes eating. After he relieves
himself, enjoy his company for the evening.
5. Take him outside just before you go to bed. Confine him for
the night.
Recognizing the signs of need
Sometimes (possibly many times), your Chihuahua must relieve
himself more often than what the sample schedule in the previous
section suggests. When housetraining, prevention works wonders,
so watch him closely. Take your Chi outside immediately if he
exhibits the following behavior:
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
138

 Begins walking in circles and sniffing the floor
 Starts panting when he hasn’t been exercising
 Suddenly leaves the room
Play, heavy exercise, and a nice massage act as on switches for
puppy plumbing. So if you just finished a playing or petting ses-
sion, it’s a good idea to take your Chi outside.
Does it sound like you’ll be running in and out as often as a con-
fused cat? Well, for awhile, you will be. But it isn’t a life sentence.
As your pup gets older, he’ll need to eat only twice a day and his
holding capacity will increase, so he’ll need fewer trips outdoors.
Dealing with accidents
All puppies (and often dogs in new homes) make mistakes. If you
get home too late and your Chi already had an accident, don’t make
a big deal out of it. Your puppy won’t understand why you’re so
angry with him when he was so glad to see you, and that leads to
far worse problems. Pointing at the poop while screaming at him
won’t help. You’ll surely scare him, which may lead to anxiety-
related problems.
If the dirty deed was done before you got home, take your pup out-
side anyway. Eventually, he’ll learn to expect and to wait for the
opportunity to go outside. Have patience and understand that he
may still be too young to control himself for the length of time that
you were away. Clean up the soiled spot as soon as you can, using
an odor neutralizer or plain white vinegar.
Buy a good odor neutralizer and stain remover (UrineOff is a good
one). Removing the evidence of your dog’s mistakes immediately
keeps your house looking and smelling like home, not a kennel. An
odor-free floor is an important part of housetraining. Dogs tend to
eliminate where their noses tell them they went before, so quick
cleanups help prevent future accidents.
Never use any cleanup product containing ammonia, for the crate
or the carpet. The odor of ammonia makes dogs seek out the same
spot to go potty again.
If you catch your Chi in the act of an accident, you may be able to
stop him mid-squat with a firm “No!” or a loud noise like clapping
your hands. Pick him up, hurry him outside to the right spot, and
praise him if he finishes what he started. Contrary to old wives’
tales, swatting a dog with a rolled-up newspaper or putting his
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 139

nose in his mess won’t work. Punishment teaches a dog to elimi-
nate behind the sofa where he thinks you won’t find it, not to go
outside and do it proudly in front of you.
Teaching Words that 
All Good Dogs Obey
Imagine how nice it is living with a dog that always comes when you
call, sits and lies down on command, stays in place when told to,
and respects the words No and Enough. Making this happen is 
easier than you think. I show you how in the sections that follow.
Conditioning your Chi to respond to the commands Come, Sit, Down,
Stay, No, and Enough can start at any age, but younger is better.
Conditioning Chihuahua puppies (or adult dogs) requires a trainer
with an upbeat attitude — one who gives plenty of praise and posi-
tive reinforcement, with absolutely no punishment. If that’s you, go
ahead and get going! When teaching the meaning of the following
commands, praise or reward your Chi every time he gives you the
correct response, and simply ignore him when he doesn’t. Dogs
will do virtually anything for attention, so yours should quickly
learn the lingo.
How often do you and your Chihuahua need to practice simple
commands such as Sit, Down, and Come? Every day. But you don’t
need to set aside a special time for it. Instead, you can use the
commands during daily life: Sit, for the dinner dish. Come, for a
treat. Down, for petting. You get the picture.
Coming when called
Use bribery to teach your Chi what Come means. For instance, you
can follow these simple steps:
1. Introduce the word at feeding time by saying his name and
then the word “Come” in a happy voice (“Pepe, come!”).
2. Show him his dinner dish.
3. Walk backward a few steps while holding it.
4. When your pup follows, praise him and then let him eat.
5. Repeat the process every time you feed him.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
140

When conditioning your Chi to Come, call him only when you know
he wants to come — not when he’s sleepy or busy with food, a toy,
or another person. Later, when your Chihuahua is older, you may
want to attend obedience school (see Chapter 11). There you dis-
cover how to teach him to Come no matter what the distraction. 
In the meantime, practice often. Call him for all the good stuff —
dinner, treats, and cuddles — and he’ll soon respond happily.
How soon should you start training your puppy to Come? As soon
as he settles in. He loves the attention, but keep the training ses-
sions short (like puppy attention spans) and always be cheerful
and upbeat.
Puppies love to chase, and chasing games help them learn what
Come means. Touch your Chi on his rump playfully, say his name
followed by the word “Come,” and then run away a few steps while
clapping (not too loudly) and talking happily. Let him catch you
and then play with him for a few seconds before giving him
another playful tap and starting over. Three times is plenty for one
session.
Never sabotage your training by calling a Chihuahua of any age to
give him a pill or chastise him for something. Go to your dog for
the upsetting stuff, and keep his Comes carefree.
Sitting pretty
To teach your Chi what Sit means (see Figure 10-1), follow these
simple steps:
1. Hold a treat in front of his nose, say “Sit,” and then move
the treat upward and back over his head.
When his eyes follow the goodie upward, his head will tilt
back and his rear end will lower until it reaches the floor.
2. Give the treat immediately while he’s still sitting and
praise him.
3. Try it three or four more times, but be sure to quit while
he’s still having fun.
A soft treat, such as a nibble of cheese (provided that your Chi
isn’t lactose intolerant), makes a good training tool. It’s healthy,
and a Chihuahua can eat it fast so you can continue training. Tiny
pieces of soft, moist dog treats also work well.
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 141

Going down
To teach the Down command, start with your Chi in the Sit posi-
tion (see the preceding section). Now follow these steps:
1. Hold a tasty treat right in front of his nose and say
“Down.”
2. Make a movement shaped like a capital L by lowering the
treat straight down, just in front of his paws, and then
slowly pulling it forward at ground level.
As he reaches for the goody, the front half of your pup’s
body should move downward.
3. If his body doesn’t lower completely to the ground, put
gentle pressure on his shoulders with your free hand, but
don’t mash him down.
4. The instant his whole body is in the Down position, give
him the treat (see Figure 10-2).
Teaching stay
Your Chi probably bounces up from his Sit right after you give him
his treat, but now you’ll prolong that process by teaching the Stay
command:
1. Stand on your Chi’s right side, with both of you facing the
same way, and hold a treat in your right hand.
2. Tell him to “Sit,” but this time don’t give him the treat as
soon as his butt touches the floor. Instead, move your left
hand sideways, stopping just in front of his nose (palm
facing him), and say “Stay” at the same time.
3. Let a long second pass before giving him the treat.
Gradually — very gradually — work up to a ten-second
Stay before presenting the reward. Decide how many sec-
onds each Stay will be before you start, and vary the time.
Otherwise, your Chi will soon outguess you.
What should you do if he moves before time’s up? Absolutely noth-
ing. Don’t reward, don’t pet, and don’t punish. Just try again later
and praise your dog when he does it right. After he learns to stay
in place in the Sit position, you can use the same procedure to
teach him what Down-Stay means.

142

to come.
Figure 10-2: Manchita downs for a treat.
Staying in place isn’t a puppy’s forte, so when conditioning your
young Chi, begin with two- or three-second Stays and don’t try to
make him remain in place longer than ten seconds (use a watch;
you’ll be surprised by how long ten seconds actually is). If your
ultimate goal is for him to stay in place for several minutes, an 
obedience school is your best bet (see Chapter 11).
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 143

Making “No!” and 
“Enough!” effective
Your petite pup may amaze your friends by walking on a leash like
an obedience champ and performing Sits and Downs on command.
But if he’s a brat when show-off time is over, he isn’t the pure
pleasure he can be.
All dogs need to respond to two words: “No!” and “Enough!” No
means “Stop that right now and don’t ever do it again.” If you bark
out the word No in a sharp tone, your attitude won’t be lost on
your Chihuahua.
Just don’t use No too often, or your Chi will get used to it. Reserve
the word for really bad behavior like teething on a table leg or nip-
ping at feet or clothing. If your voice isn’t emphatic enough, clap
your hands (once) right after you say No.
What if your Chi ignores you and continues chewing the chair leg?
Go to him, pick him up, move him away from the temptation, and
give him something he’s allowed to chew. Then praise him for
chewing the proper item. If he heads back to the forbidden object
later, bark your firmest No yet, followed by a clap of your hands, if
necessary, to get his attention. If he persists on trying to mouth the
chair leg, tap his nose lightly as you say No, and then take him to a
different closed-off room where he can play with his own toys.
Always keep your cool, and never touch your dog in anger. If you
have a temper (you know who you are), stick with a verbal No.
“Enough” means “What you are doing was just fine for awhile, but
you’ve been doing it for too long, so stop now.” Use Enough when
you don’t want to pet your Chi anymore but he keeps pawing your
hand. Say Enough if he gets too wound up during play or continues
barking long after the meter reader leaves. Said firmly but without
anger, Enough works on puppies, adult dogs, and the kids that play
with them!
Preventing Common Problems
Besides housetraining issues, common puppy problems include
destructive chewing, persistent barking, jumping, nipping, and pos-
sessiveness. Okay, that’s the bad news. The good news is that if
your Chi is still young, you can prevent most of the typical pitfalls
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
144

of puppyhood. And prevention is a whole lot easier than correcting
problems after they become bad habits. Yes, that’s possible, too
(see Chapter 11), but why do it the hard way when prevention is so
much easier? The following sections help you prevent the common
behaviors before they become problems.
All dogs need toys, but don’t overdo it. A dog with too many toys
may begin to believe that everything is a toy. Then he won’t learn to
discriminate between his toys and all the taboo items in the house.
Teaching what’s okay to chew
Your puppy needs to chew, but teaching him what to chew isn’t
always easy. This section presents a nifty training aid, compli-
ments of my friend Amy Ammen, director of Amiable Dog Training
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and author of several dog training books.
She calls this training exercise “Shopping Spree.”
After your puppy knows how to walk on lead (see Chapter 9),
teach him to discriminate between his toys and taboo items by
taking him on a shopping spree right in your living room:
1. Choose a word that means “get that out of your mouth”
(most people opt for “Out” or “Drop It”).
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 145
Techichis believed to be true soul mates
During the 12th century in Mexico, the Aztec Indians wiped out the Toltec nation
but spared their dogs, the Techichis, because the dogs had such an impressive job
description. Believed to be holy, their task was to guide their dead owner’s soul to
safety. This concept appealed to the Aztecs because they needed all the help they
could get. After all, they believed the dead had to cross nine perilous lands and a
treacherous underworld river before their souls reached safety. So when the Aztecs
burned a dead warrior, they burned his dog with him. They thought the little holy
dog would race on ahead, fight off evil spirits, and wait on the far bank of the raging
river until it saw its master, and then swim back across, guiding him safely to the
other side.
Sacrificing a dog with red skin by burning it along with a human corpse was also
popular with the Aztecs. They believed the sins of the deceased were transferred
to the dog and not taken out on the person. No doubt that’s why archeologists 
discovered a number of graves in Mexico containing both human and Techichi
remains.

2. Place some personal objects — such as a wallet, slippers,
or purse — and some paper products — like napkins or a
roll of toilet tissue — on the floor along with two of your
puppy’s toys.
3. With the props in place, put a leash on your puppy and let
him explore the clutter.
4. When he picks up a taboo item, say your command along
with giving a tiny jerk on the leash (just enough so he feels
it — if it moves his body, it’s too hard).
5. Walk toward an appropriate toy and encourage your puppy
to play with it.
Take your puppy shopping a couple times a day and he’ll soon take
pride in leading you to one of his correct objects. When he does,
be sure to praise him and let him keep his toy. And now that he
knows the command for releasing an object, you should use that
command, and only that command, whether he’s holding a slipper,
a finger, or a dead mouse.
Controlling barking
Chihuahuas make good watchdogs because they have excellent hear-
ing and a loud bark, considering their size. Some barking is a good
thing. Most people are glad when their dogs tell them that strangers
are approaching their homes. But it’s best to be glad quietly, taking
your Chi’s protective tendencies for granted instead of praising them.
For example, the first time he goes into a prolonged barking fit at a
door-to-door salesman, don’t act like it’s adorable unless you want
him to bark long and hard at visitors all his life. Instead, let him
know right from the start when he’s barked long enough by saying
“Enough.” (I discuss this command earlier in this chapter.) It isn’t
barking, but rather excessive barking, that drives people mad.
The problem is, even if you take your Chi’s warning barks for
granted and don’t bother to praise him for giving you advance
notice when a visitor arrives, he usually feels rewarded anyway.
That’s because every time the meter reader or the salesperson
leaves (after being barked at, of course), your Chi thinks he chased
them away. And that makes him feel real macho.
Trying to thwart a Chihuahua’s natural tendency to protect his
family only frustrates him. Worse yet, he may learn to keep quiet
no matter what instead of acting as your early-warning system.
Countless Chihuahuas have alerted their families about fires and
scared off burglars with their shrill bark. The trick is being able to
turn off your live alarm on command.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
146

Use the command Enough to let him know when he’s done his duty
and it’s time to quiet down. If that doesn’t work — and only as a
last resort — buy a small spray bottle. Keep it handy and give him
one surprise squirt, right in the face, to enforce the Enough word.
You should avoid the tendency to threaten him with the water
treatment, though. It’s best if he thinks his barking, not you,
flooded his face.
Don’t punish your Chi after the fact. Not even if he has a guilty
look. The truth is, dogs don’t feel guilt. That’s a people thing. Nor
do they remember what they did five minutes ago. Sure, there’s
poop on the rug and your Chi looks worried, but what you’re
seeing in his eyes is confusion. He senses that you’re angry with
him, but he doesn’t know why, which makes him apprehensive.
Hence, the guilty look.
Deciding if jumping is okay
Only you can decide if jumping is an okay behavior for your
Chihuahua. After all, Chis weigh hardly anything, so the danger 
of most people being knocked over is nonexistent.
Some people like having their dogs joyfully jump on them. If you’re
one of those people, nothing is wrong with jumping as long as you
enjoy having your Chi jump on you no matter what you’re wearing.
Your Chi isn’t clothes-conscious enough to understand that jump-
ing on you when you’re wearing jeans is okay, but it isn’t okay when
you’re dressed to impress. The point is, don’t let him do something
one day that you don’t want him to do another day. Decide right
away if jumping is okay or not; if it isn’t, read on.
You’ll have to change your Chi’s method of greeting people when
you teach him not to jump. For instance, teach him to Sit on com-
mand (see the previous “Sitting pretty” section), and then tell him
to sit (in a happy but firm voice) as soon as you open the door.
When he does (even if you have to put him in the Sit position),
kneel down to his level and give him plenty of praise. A Chi will want
to jump on you for instant attention, but if you withhold your atten-
tion until after he’s sitting, he’ll soon learn to Sit for your approval.
Nipping nipping
Puppies use their mouths to investigate things, much the same
way humans use their hands. They also use their mouths in play
and sometimes to vent their high spirits. But needle-sharp teeth
hurt, so you must teach your puppy that nipping isn’t nice.
Chapter 10: Establishing Good Behavior and Manners 147

Resist the urge to jerk your hand away from your puppy when he
clamps down on it. That’s the canine version of an invitation to
play, so pulling away just makes him come back for another nip.
How can you tell your pup that clamping down hurts? Say ouch!
And say it like you mean it. Screech it out in a high-pitched voice
that lets him know that he hurt you. Most pups will lick you in
apology. If a week or two of yelping “Ouch!” doesn’t make a differ-
ence, choose a command that means “Don’t Bite.” Say it every time
your Chi touches you with his teeth, and put your finger on his
button nose and press gently while you say it.
A last resort (use only on confirmed nippers) is dabbing a Bitter
Apple spray on the part of you your puppy nips. This works espe-
cially well on shoelace and sock chasers.
Preventing possessiveness
Most puppy possessiveness starts over the food dish. That’s
because puppies compete with their littermates (brothers and sis-
ters) for food. Sometimes they have to be deprogrammed when
they enter a human family. Nothing to it. Just mix up these four
choices — using one during one meal and a different one at the
next meal, and so on. After a couple weeks, your Chi should stop
being possessive of his bowl:
 Feed your Chihuahua his kibble a nugget or two at a time from
your hand with your hand in his food bowl.
 Give him only 1⁄4th of his dinner. Then just as he finishes the
tiny portion, put the rest of his meal in the bowl.
 Put a cushion on the floor and sit down beside his food dish.
Pet him for a minute or two as he begins his dinner, and then
walk away and let him eat the rest of his meal alone.
 When he’s nearly finished eating, walk up to him and place a
tiny, but very special, treat in his dish. A slice of hot dog, a
sliver of cheese, or a bit of burger will make him happy that
you put your hand in his bowl.
I recommend dropping a very good treat into your puppy’s food
bowl as he’s eating his food so that he thinks adults/children
approaching his bowl is a good thing. This can prevent serious
bites near a food bowl — especially if a baby crawls too close.

h oh! Chief Chihuahua rules at your house. He growls when
someone tries to sit in his chair, barks as loud and as long as
he pleases, refuses to drop forbidden objects, guards his food with
a vengeance, and sometimes even snaps to keep his spot on the
bed. Obviously, a coup is long overdue. It’s time to overthrow your
tiny tyrant and put policymaking back in the hands of the people —
namely, you! With dogs, a benevolent dictatorship works best. First,
elect yourself president for life. Then read this chapter. It helps you
turn your tiny tyrant into a true friend for life.
Curing Your Crybaby
Most puppies whine and bark the first several times their owners
confine them to rooms or crates. Whatever you do, don’t take your
Chihuahua out of his place of confinement to stop the racket. That’s
exactly what he wants, and doing so makes him feel rewarded for
barking nonstop. Instead, wait until he’s silent for at least a minute;
then you can go to him and let him out.

You can use some other tactics to squelch your Pepe’s complaints.
Try them in the following order, moving on to the next one in line
only if you need to:
1. The first few times you confine your Chi and leave him
alone, try to put up with the noise for ten minutes with-
out doing anything. Some dogs simply quit sounding off
when they realize they’re dramatizing to an empty theater.
2. Play a radio softly near him. Music relaxes some dogs.
Just be sure to keep both the radio and the cord out of his
reach.
3. If he is still mouthing off, make a sudden loud noise from
another room. You can stamp your foot or slap the wall. But
be sure not to say anything. It’s better if he thinks that his
own racket, not you, caused the noise. As soon as he whines
again, make the noise again. Repeat as often as necessary.
4. From the room next to the one he’s confined in, bang two
metal pots together. Do this once only every time he barks
or whines.
5. Fill a spray bottle with plain water, and every time he
makes a racket, walk in silently and squirt him one time,
directly in the face. Then walk out again. When he’s quiet
for a minute or two, go to him without the spray bottle and
pet and praise him. Repeat as necessary. It won’t be neces-
sary long! This is a last resort, because it’s physical and
your dog sees you do it, unlike the loud noise, which you
hope he thinks he caused.
Your Chihuahua should always have a safe chew toy and something
to snuggle under when he’s confined. This will make him feel safe
and may reduce his tendency to whine and cry.
Quieting Your Barker
Some Chihuahuas are noisy little dogs that seem to yip at the slight-
est provocations and mouth off nonstop when they want attention.
Their tendency to vocalize makes them good watchdogs, so smart
owners don’t want to completely turn off their tiny noisemakers.
But frenzied barking for attention or when someone walks near the
house gets old real fast.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
150

You want to scream when your barking dog drives you to distrac-
tion, but resist the urge. If you yell when your Chihuahua barks,
he’ll think you’re joining in. Then the excitement of leading his best
friend in a bark-a-long will egg him on all the more. Don’t get exas-
perated and pick him up, either. All that does is make him feel even
braver. Why? Because in your arms he’s taller and protected by you.
The following sections explain what you can and should do in two
specific situations: when your Chi barks at the door and barks for
attention.
Mouthing off at the door
Your Chi needs to learn the command “Enough” (see Chapter 10)
so you can appreciate his warning bark when a stranger comes to
the door but turn it off on command (see Figure 11-1). You can also
use Enough to stop him from barking for attention (see the follow-
ing section). If your Chi wasn’t taught to respond to Enough as a
pup, try the spray bottle method I discuss in the previous section.
It usually does the trick. In rare cases where it doesn’t, try the 
following:
1. Rather than plain water, pour a mixture of vinegar and
water (a few drops of vinegar added to the water) into
your spray bottle.
2. Have a friend ring the bell and/or knock on the door.
3. Let your Chi alert you (that’s a good thing) and then tell
him “Enough,” firmly.
4. If the command doesn’t stop his tirade, make him think
twice by spraying him in the mouth with the mixture.
Be as discreet as possible. It’s best if he thinks his tantrum,
not you, caused the sour taste in his mouth.
Repeat if you have to, but whatever you do, don’t lose your
temper.
One of the best ways to cure a Chihuahua that barks like crazy at
the door is to set up situations in which friends bearing treats ring
the bell. At the sound, put a leash on your dog, open the door, and
invite the person in. Give the “Sit” command, and as soon as your
dog shuts his mouth and sits, have the visitor give him a treat. This
system may take several tries, but eventually your dog will figure
out that the doorbell doesn’t signal the boogeydog!
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Place as Head of Household 151

Figure 11-1: Cricket guards the entrance to her
motor home but quiets down on command.
Yapping for attention
If your Chi barks incessantly for attention, don’t give in and cuddle
him; if you do, he’ll discover how to manipulate a petting session
whenever he wants one. Instead, either ignore him or use the
“Enough” command (see Chapter 10) — reinforcing it, if necessary,
with your spray bottle (one squirt only of plain water, directly in
his face). Don’t let him see the shower coming. He should think he
triggered it by barking after hearing the word Enough. (See the first
section for more on using a spray bottle.)
Housetraining a Stubborn
Chihuahua
Because so much of housetraining is up to the owner, let me ask
you a few questions:
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
152

Does the cliché, “When all else fails, read the instructions,” fit
you? Did you set up a routine, as suggested in Chapter 10, and
follow it without fail?
Did you clean up every mistake right away (without using
ammonia or yelling at your dog)?
Did you praise your Chi every time he relieved himself in the
right place?
Did you give him an opportunity to go potty as soon as you got
up in the morning, every time you arrived home, as well as
after every meal, nap, and play session (up to ten times a day
when totaled)?
Be honest with yourself. If your routine is haphazard or you’re not
taking out your dog often enough, it’s you who are sabotaging
housetraining. Get a crate, read Chapter 10, and start over.
Maybe it isn’t your fault at all, however. If you did everything right
and your Chi still leaves doggy-do on the carpet, keep the routine
going but add the following. Also, check out the following sections,
which explain different types of accidents. Knowledge is power!
 When you come home, don’t greet your Chi or give him any
positive attention until after he eliminates in the proper
place. Then praise the devil out of him.
 Learn to read your dog’s bathroom language. Most
Chihuahuas (and other dogs) circle several times before
squatting. If your dog starts circling, pick him up and head for
the potty place. Then praise him for going there.
 Control his intake of water. Careful! Dehydration is dangerous!
Give him free access to water during the day — especially with
and after his meals and following activity — but take away his
water dish about three hours before you go to bed.
If it’s hot in your house or if your Chi plays hard later in the
evening, let him lap some ice cubes. That way he gets the
liquid he needs without bloating himself.
 Crate your Chi when you go out without him — even for just
a few minutes.
 When you’re home, keep your dog with you on lead until
he’s reliably housebroken. That way he can’t sneak a whiz
behind the sofa.
This technique also gives you a chance to catch him in the
act. If you do, keep calm, tell him “No!” emphatically (without
yelling), pick him up, and take him outside. Then tell him how
wonderful he is for finishing the job in the right place.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Place as Head of Household 153

Marking — it’s a macho thing
Male dogs have an instinct to mark their territory, for which they
use (you guessed it) urine. It’s a macho thing. Dogs think their scent
warns male dogs to stay away and attracts the ladies, but owners
feel like bawling when their dogs lift their legs on table legs and
bookcases.
Neutering provides the quickest cure. Otherwise, just keep your
housetraining routine going, crate your Chi when you’re away, and
be patient. Housebreaking an intact (unneutered) male Chihuahua
is possible, but it takes longer.
Sometimes, just as you relax and congratulate yourself on your
housetraining accomplishment, your dog reaches puberty, learns
to lift his leg, and must be reminded of his manners. A few weeks 
of keeping him on lead in the house (so he’s always with you) and
confining him when you’re away often is all it takes to put him back
on schedule.
Submissive urination
When you come home, does your dog greet you happily but with 
a hint of shyness, while squatting and dribbling several drops of
urine? That’s called submissive urination. Though often mistaken
for a housetraining problem, this is really an anxiety problem and
has nothing to do with housetraining at all. The tendency may be
inherited, may be caused by harsh or too-frequent corrections, or
even by abuse your Chihuahua suffered before you got him.
Between wolves in the wild, submissive urination means, “Hi boss.
Sure hope I didn’t do anything to upset you, but if I did, I’m sorry.”
Though it happens most often during a greeting, a dribble may also
occur when you bend over him to pick him up or when you chas-
tise him. The urination is a conditioned reflex to dominant treat-
ment, and your Chi isn’t doing it on purpose. In fact, he doesn’t
know he’s doing it at all.
Never chastise your Chi for submissive urination, because that
only makes it worse.
The easiest way to prevent a host of problems — including submis-
sive urination, whining when confined, separation anxiety, and
jumping — is to come and go without making a fuss. Long apologies
before leaving and boisterous homecomings overstimulate many
dogs, and excited dogs behave erratically.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
154

Toss a treat for your Chi the instant you arrive home instead of
bending over to pick him up. After he eats the treat, ignore him
until he comes to you for attention. When he does, tickle under his
chin or rub his chest (with your palm up) instead of reaching over
his head or bending over him.
You also can teach him a few easy commands so he knows how to
please you and earn praise. Then use a simple command, such as
“Sit,” when you greet each other (see Chapter 10). Now you’ve
given him a positive way to express his devotion and earn your
praise.
Compliments from you are what eventually break the submissive
urination cycle. Being praised for a correct response builds confi-
dence, and confidence is what a Chi needs to conquer submissive
urination.
Reinforcing the “Drop It”
Command
Your Chihuahua is a portable vacuum cleaner with the mouth mus-
cles of Jaws, Jr., and he loves what he shouldn’t have. How can you
get him to release forbidden objects without prying his tiny trap
open? First, try taking him on a “shopping spree” (see Chapter 10).
If he still refuses to drop taboo booty, put a drop of Bitter Apple
spray (available in pet stores) on your finger, and then slide your
finger along his gum line as you give the “Drop It” or “Out” command
(choose a command and use the same one every time). He’ll soon
discover that it’s smart to let go. (The “Trading for treats” section
later in this chapter offers yet another technique.)
Humping (How Humiliating!)
Oh no! Your Chihuahua just humped Aunt Amelia’s leg during the
family reunion. Why does he do these nasty things? Rampaging
male hormones are often to blame when he embarrasses you by
humping someone’s leg or puts on a sex show with a throw pillow.
Dogs don’t have sexual inhibitions like people do, so when the
scent of a female in season wafts by and stimulates his libido, he
tries to satisfy his frustrations with whatever is available. Because
legs are close enough to the right height and width, many dogs
mount them.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Place as Head of Household 155

Neutering cures many males of mounting and relieves their frustra-
tions, making them better pets in other ways as well. But if the
humping is habitual, you may not notice a difference for a month
or more after surgery.
Although neutering (see Chapter 13) is the cure of choice, some
people may not want to neuter their Chihuahuas because they plan
to use them for showing and breeding. Because dogs that mount
legs are also displaying dominance (the urge to be boss), dealing
with that urge may break the habit (see the following section).
You soon recognize when your dog’s libido is becoming overactive.
If he heads for a leg with that telltale vacant look in his eye, distract
him by using a command such as “Sit” to stop him in his tracks.
Keeping a shaker can handy also helps. (That’s an empty soda 
can with a few pennies in it and a piece of tape over the opening.) 
If your Chi still tries to attach himself to his favorite throw pillow
or your spouse’s ankle, break his focus by tossing the can so it 
hits the floor near him (just don’t hit him).
These techniques (and those that follow) also cure females that
are so dominant that they have a mounting habit.
Don’t get angry with your dog to teach him who’s boss. All that
does is teach him aggression. Withhold petting and praise until he
earns it. Make him work for attention by obeying a command (such
as Sit) or performing a trick (see Chapter 12), and give him more
exercise (see Chapter 8).
Dealing with Dominance
If your Chihuahua has a tendency to be possessive, his behavior
may extend beyond the food dish (see Chapter 10 for more). Some
Chihuahuas (and other breeds) demand sole ownership of their
favorite chairs, their end of the sofa, or even their snuggle spots on
the bed. And when anyone tries to sit in their spots, the resentful
dogs snarl a warning and, in some cases, may even snap. Granted,
Chihuahuas tend to be sassy — but surly is unacceptable.
You should never, ever be afraid of your dog. Not even for an
instant. Don’t ignore or excuse threatening behavior because it
ended quickly. If you do, next time your Chi’s threat will be even
stronger. And yes, if he got away with growling at you once, there
will be a next time.
Most Chihuahua owners react with surprise the first time their
petite pooches growl a warning at them. They don’t realize that the
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
156

growls (which, if unchecked, can escalate into snapping) only hap-
pened after their dogs established dominance over them in several
subtle ways. For example, does your Chi badger you into petting
him by pawing at you or nudging your hand? Do you sit where you
did before you got him, or has he taken over your favorite corner
of the sofa? Do you feed or give him treats when you want to or
when he demands (or begs)?
If he’s already calling some of the shots, you’ve lost round one; it
may be only a matter of time before he’s ready to test you at
another level. Perhaps you’ll be in a rush to clean up before com-
pany arrives, so you reach for his food dish before he licks the last
morsel. He goes rigid and stands over the dish with his eyes looking
directly into yours. You shrug it off and say something like, “Okay,
just hurry up and finish it.” You’ve just lost round two. When round
three comes, it could be a growl. You now know there’s a problem,
but you’ll probably think that he never did anything like that before.
Okay, now that you know what can happen, you can start prevent-
ing it immediately. The following sections show you how.
If possessiveness is becoming a problem, encourage other mem-
bers of your household to make your Chi earn his rewards by
obeying commands. Otherwise, he may learn to obey you but still
challenge your spouse, for instance.
Possessive pup adjustment
The same techniques both prevent and cure possessiveness (but
prevention is always the best policy). One of the best ways is to
make your Chihuahua work for his food and privileges. If you
haven’t taught him the basic commands in Chapter 10, start now. If
you did teach them, you’re ahead of the game. Use them in every-
day life. “Sit” when your dog wants food. “Down” when your dog
wants petting. “Come” when he wants a treat. Sit and “Stay” before
you allow him up on the sofa. “Enough” when you’re tired of pet-
ting him and he paws you for more. You get the picture. At the first
hint of possessiveness, make these acts privileges, not rights.
Establish dominance by inviting your Chi to sit beside you by saying
“Come On Up” and patting the sofa when you say it. Then lift him
up beside you if necessary. At the same time, teach him to “Get
Down” by giving that command while pointing at the floor. He will
figure out the signal if you place him on the floor every time you
say it. Eventually, he’ll jump up and get down on command under
his own steam.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Place as Head of Household 157

Young puppies can’t jump up on the sofa themselves and shouldn’t
be allowed to jump down because they can damage their legs or
shoulders. Using the cues Come On Up and Get Down before your
puppy matures is a good idea, but place him on the furniture and
always lift him down while he’s young.
Changing your attitude
Is possessiveness already a problem? You need to change your atti-
tude as well. Instead of taking the path of least resistance, like back-
ing away when your Chi growls (which teaches him that growling
gets him what he wants), resolve to take command of the situation.
Make him work for every bit of attention. Use the commands from
Chapter 10 often, and give your dog affection and praise only for
complying. If he growls when he’s on the bed, don’t allow him on
the bed. The same applies to the sofa, chair, or wherever he dis-
plays dominance (see Figure 11-2). After several days of making
him earn attention, you can let him share your chair again. But
only on your terms — by invitation only — from now on. It could
take months of not allowing him on your bed or chair before the
behavior changes.
Don’t pity him because he has to go through this. You’re doing him
a favor. When you train your Chihuahua and let him know how to
please you, he becomes happier and more content. After all, he can
relax. The household is in good hands — yours!
Figure 11-2: Possessive dogs defend “their” chairs, but Tiko hopes her owner
will join her.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
158

Dealing with hard cases
If your dog has been the boss for a long time and is serious about
biting when you try to reform him with the tactics I describe here,
don’t try to deal with him yourself anymore. A Chihuahua may be
small but he can still do damage — especially if he snaps at your
face. Instead, ask your veterinarian to recommend a professional
trainer or behaviorist. The investment you make is worth it. A
good pro puts your relationship back on the right track and
teaches you how to maintain it.
Trading for treats
Some Chihuahuas become possessive over treasured objects —
anything they have that you want to take from them, such as a
pencil that fell off your desk. You can try to prevent possessive-
ness over objects by teaching your Chihuahua what “Out” means:
1. Get a small plastic container with a lid, break up a few of
your dog’s favorite biscuits, and place them inside.
2. Shake the container, open it, and give him one treat.
Do that two or three times a day until the mere sound of
the shake excites him.
3. Graduate to shaking the container while he gnaws on his
favorite toy.
4. Say “Out,” give him a treat when he drops the toy, and
walk away without touching the toy.
5. After several days of this, pick up the toy when you give
him the treat, hold it for a second or two, and then put it
down again.
Soon you’ll be able to get him to open his mouth and trade
any object for a treat.
When the object is a taboo item, be sure to keep it after making the
trade and then show your Chi his own chew toy. For an alternative
method, often used for habitual offenders, see the section
“Reinforcing the ‘Drop It’ Command” earlier in this chapter.
Home Alone and Feeling Frantic
Most mature dogs catch a nap when their owners leave the house,
but some anxious dogs pitch a fit when they’re left home alone.
They may chew on the carpet, shred the toilet paper, urinate, bark
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Place as Head of Household 159

nonstop, or unleash any combination of destructive behaviors.
You’re probably thinking, “poor owners,” but believe it or not, the
destructive dogs are miserable, too. They have a problem called
separation anxiety.
To better understand separation anxiety in dogs (see Figure 11-3),
consider the phobias people have. Some people are afraid of
heights, others are afraid of tight places, and still others are afraid
of the water. Well, dogs are social creatures, and some of them are
afraid of being alone. They panic, pure and simple, and then make
noise or destroy stuff to release pent-up nervous energy.
The following sections help you understand the condition even
more and provide some tips for alleviating your dog’s nerves.
Figure 11-3: Dogs hate to be left alone, but most eventually get used to it —
within reason.
Adjusting your exits and entrances
Some dogs seem to be born with tendencies toward separation anx-
iety. Others develop it after a major change — the owner’s divorce
or being given up for adoption. But a surprising number of dogs
catch the problem from their owners. It goes something like this:
“Oh, poor poor Pepe. I’m leaving now. Are you gonna miss me?
Are you? I’m gonna miss you. Poor sweetums. You’ll be all
alone (kiss, kiss). Now you’ll be a good boy, won’t you? Give
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
160

mama a kiss. That’s my boy. Poor baby. I’ll be back soon. I
promise (kiss, kiss).”
And then the owner leaves.
Now, what does Pepe make of all this? He just got a lot of attention
and sympathy and then his human left. Maybe she’s not coming
back. Maybe he’ll never see her again. Maybe he’ll never see
anyone ever again. No wonder he feels anxious!
The best way to prevent separation anxiety is to make your com-
ings and goings low key. Ignore your Chihuahua for ten minutes
before you leave and take him for granted when you return. Don’t
make the mistake of thinking that your dog has human emotions.
He doesn’t tear up the house out of spite because you left him
alone. And he certainly doesn’t have fun doing it. He’s actually 
miserable. Separation anxiety is comparable to a person with
claustrophobia getting stuck in an elevator. Your Chi needs help,
not punishment.
The following section details what you can do for a dog that already
suffers from the problem.
Alleviating the anxiety
Okay. You know your dog already has a problem with separation
anxiety. Perhaps you could’ve prevented it, but no need to fret
over that now. Just don’t set up your dog for another dreadful day
of demolition. Instead, crate him comfortably when you leave the
house (see Chapters 5 and 10 for tips). In addition to keeping him
out of trouble, being in his den may calm him. Yes, I know, that’s
just a quick fix and doesn’t actually cure the problem. But it’s a
start, and you’re keeping your dog out of trouble so he doesn’t
sense your aggravation.
Now that you have the destruction under control, you can work on
alleviating your Chi’s anxiety problem when he has the run of the
house (or even a whole room). To do this, you must leave the house
frequently for short periods of time. Eventually, that teaches him
that comings and goings are unimportant because you always
return. Here’s how to set up your scenarios:
1. Take Pepe outside to eliminate about ten minutes before
you leave.
2. Turn on the radio and make sure two of his favorite toys
are available.
Chapter 11: Keeping Your Place as Head of Household 161

3. Leave Pepe’s crate in its normal place with the door open
so he can go inside if he wants to.
4. Don’t say goodbye or reassure Pepe in any way. In fact,
don’t give him any attention at all for several minutes
before you leave.
5. Leave, close the door behind you, and count to ten. Open
the door, go inside, and ignore Pepe for a minute or two.
Then tell him to “Sit” and praise him for obeying (see
Chapter 10).
6. Gradually increase the amount of time before you come
back in. Make progress slow at first. Take two weeks to
go from ten seconds to ten minutes.
If you find a puddle or the beginning of any destruction,
don’t call it to Pepe’s attention; make a mental note of how
long you were gone. Next time, decrease the amount of
time you stay away. Then gradually work your way back up.
With a lot of practice (and patience), you may be able to work your
way up to spending a few hours away from home without your Chi
having an anxiety attack. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work with
every dog. If your dog doesn’t learn to accept separations, he may
need professional help. Ask your vet for referral to a behaviorist (if
you’re lucky, there may be a board-certified veterinary behaviorist
in your area). The solution will include desensitization work and
may include a temporary prescription of a drug to help keep your
dog calm as he completes his desensitization program.
If your dog used to suffer from separation anxiety but overcame it,
be sure to put him in a reputable boarding kennel when you go on
vacation instead of hiring a dogwalker or housesitter. Otherwise,
leaving home and not returning for a week or more could make 
him regress.
Now that you know what to do, here’s what you shouldn’t do: If
your Chihuahua becomes a demolition demon when home alone,
the worst — yes, the absolute worst — thing you can do is punish
him when you get back. This simply gives him additional anxiety.
Instead of being scared only when you leave, he’ll be terrified of
your return, too. That means double trouble.

D
o you want to show the world your wonderful Chihuahua?
Would you like to partner with your dog to bring a little light
into someone else’s life? Does competition bring out the best in
you? If so, this chapter contains plenty of ideas to help you and
your Chihuahua find sports and hobbies you can participate in
together.
Some Chihuahua owners enjoy making the most of their dogs’ intel-
ligence and dexterity by participating in dog sports like obedience
and agility. Others like to show off their dogs’ beauty in the won-
drous world of dog shows. Chihuahuas can also earn Canine Good
Citizen Certificates and serve as therapy dogs. In this chapter, I tell
you about some activities you and your Chihuahua can participate
in as partners — activities that will benefit your Chihuahua and
make her a better companion. I also give you a short course in
trick training, for fun and functionality.
Sporting events for dogs may occur indoors or outside in all kinds
of weather. Be aware that your Chihuahua won’t be allowed to
wear a sweater during competition. Your Chi won’t do her best
when she’s chilled, so plan to attend dog events during the warm
months unless the trials take place indoors.

If your dog is a Chihuahua mix or a purebred without papers, she
can still participate in every event in this chapter with the excep-
tion of dog shows. The AKC (see Chapter 17) will grant an Indefinite
Listing Privilege to spayed/neutered, unregistered, purebred dogs
to allow them to compete in obedience and agility. The UKC also
welcomes spayed/neutered, unregistered, purebreds and mixed
breeds. And three out of four organizations that sponsor agility
events welcome mixed breeds, too. Therapy dogs, Canine Good
Citizens, and temperament-tested dogs may be any breed or mix.
Beginning Obedience Training
I like to call obedience companion dog training, because it teaches
the dog how to be a happy and responsive partner and the owner
how to train, understand, and enjoy the dog. During classes, your
Chi discovers how to work with you despite distractions like
strangers and other dogs. The happy result is enhanced compan-
ionship. Some simply call it teamwork. Whatever you call it, obedi-
ence training provides a great background for any other activity
you may want to do with your dog.
If an obedience instructor suggests a training method or correction
that doesn’t feel right to you, don’t do it. It’s your dog, and you
have the final say in her training.
Years ago, common knowledge said that dogs shouldn’t attend obe-
dience school until they’re at least 6 months old. Back then, obedi-
ence exercises (such as the long sit; see Figure 12-1) were just tools
people practiced on the training field once a week and for a few
minutes a day at home. Today, obedience schools are modernized.
Contemporary classes concentrate on practical training, and up-
to-date instructors tell their students how to incorporate the train-
ing into everyday life. Modern instructors also emphasize positive
reinforcement rather than punishment so younger dogs learn with-
out becoming stressed. We also know that 4 months is an ideal age
to enter your Chi into a novice class (although dogs profit from the
training at any age).
Reviewing obedience basics
In a novice obedience class, a Chihuahua learns how to
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
164

 Heel (walk in the traditional position by your left side) on and
off lead
 Sit when you stop
 Go down on command
 Stand quietly while a friendly stranger pets her
 Come when called
 Remain in both the “Sit” and “Down” positions amid distrac-
tions from other dogs
Best of all, provided that the training is positive and upbeat (don’t
stick around if it isn’t), your Chi gains considerable confidence
from the classes.
Dog clubs and private instructors offer obedience classes. They’re
advertised in the Yellow Pages or the newspaper. Your veterinarian
may also have info about nearby classes, and some pet supply
stores offer them right inside the stores.
Although the ultimate goal of obedience is a happy partnership with
your dog, obedience also is one of the more popular dog sports. If
your Chihuahua enjoys the training, you can turn obedience into a
hobby and enter trials. When she qualifies for her novice title, she
officially becomes Manchita, CD (in other words, the title becomes
part of her registered name — Manchita, for instance). The CD
stands for — you guessed it — Companion Dog.
In addition to the CD, the American Kennel Club (AKC) obedience
titles include the CDX (Companion Dog Excellent), the UD (Utility
Dog), the UDX (Utility Dog Excellent), and the OTCH (Obedience
Trial Champion). The United Kennel Club (UKC) also offers a series
of obedience titles.
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 165
Jumping into advanced competition
The fun doesn’t have to end after your Chihuahua earns her Companion Dog title.
She can accomplish plenty of challenging exercises in advanced competition.
Among them are retrieving a small dumbbell, jumping various hurdles, discriminat-
ing between your scent and a stranger’s, and responding to hand signals rather
than verbal commands. Are you worried about your Chi making it over the jumps?
If she has a sound body, she won’t have a problem. Your Chihuahua gets measured
before she enters the ring and the jumps are set at the right height for her size.

Choosing an obedience instructor
Shopping around is a good idea when it comes to obedience — not
for a bargain but for the best school for you and your Chihuahua.
Your Chi needs an instructor who has experience with dogs of all
sizes — especially tiny ones.
Believe it or not, you’ll recognize a first-rate teacher even though
you don’t know much about dog training yet. How? By your powers
of observation. Watch a session or two of each beginner class
offered in your area before signing up for one. Top-notch teachers
have several attributes in common. Look for the following traits:
 Good instructors are safety conscious. They demand that all
dogs be vaccinated (see Chapter 13). They don’t crowd too
many students into too small a space, and they provide a train-
ing area with sufficient traction and no hidden obstructions.
 Good instructors are masters of positive motivation. They
show their students how to use praise, petting, and toys to
encourage correct responses.
 Good instructors are flexible. They adapt their methods to fit
their students’ needs.
 Good instructors are approachable, friendly, and helpful.
They have upbeat attitudes.
 Good instructors are creative. They vary the drills by initiat-
ing group games so handlers and dogs have a good time while
performing the necessary repetitions.
 Good instructors are attentive to all their students. They work
well with handlers and dogs of all sizes, shapes, ages, and gen-
ders, and they aren’t prejudiced against any breed or mix.
 Good instructors have lesson plans. They discuss training
goals and explain how to work each new command into every-
day life. Their classes are never chaotic.
 Good instructors keep the class moving. They don’t allow
one student to monopolize the lesson.
 Good instructors respect their students and have empathy.
They’re aware that everyone in the class has feelings —
including the dogs.
One of the really cool things you discover in obedience and agility
school is that dogs, because they’re closer to the ground, see
things differently than humans do. When a student’s dog seems
leery about something, a good instructor will tell the student to get
down and look at it from the pet’s perspective. Try it sometime.

Figure 12-1: Maxie and Ginny demonstrate an obedience exercise called the
long sit.
Passing the Good Citizen 
and Temperament Tests
According to the AKC, “A Canine Good Citizen is a dog that makes
its owner happy without making someone else unhappy.” That
means Canine Good Citizens behave at home, are good neighbors,
and are polite in public.
The Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test is pass-fail and noncompetitive.
It evaluates practical training, not your dog’s formal obedience.
Your Chi is tested on how she behaves during everyday situations
like being touched by a friendly stranger, walking on a crowded
street, meeting another dog while out for a stroll, and coming when
called. She also gets graded on her reaction to distractions and her
attitude when you’re out of sight (she shouldn’t show separation
anxiety). In addition, she must obey simple commands such as
“Sit” and “Down” (see Chapter 10), but not with the precision of a
competitive obedience dog.
All CGC tests are performed on lead. If your Chi passes a ten-part
test, she earns a certificate proclaiming her a Canine Good Citizen.
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 167

Why go for the CGC honor? While preparing for the CGC test,
owners find out how to train their dogs, and their dogs become
better companions. Many dog clubs and private obedience schools
offer short courses in CGC training, and some of them give the test
as their graduation exercise. In addition, the AKC offers free info 
to help people train for the test. For CGC training material and
information on how to find a test site near you, contact the AKC
through e-mail at info@akc.org or call Customer Service at
919-233-9767.
The American Temperament Test Society (ATTS) also offers a ten-
part test and rewards dogs that pass with a Temperament Tested,
or TT, Certificate. The test takes no special training but requires a
well-socialized dog with self-confidence and a reliable disposition.
During a walk that simulates several situations, your Chi encoun-
ters friendly, neutral, and threatening scenarios and is evaluated
on her reactions. The ATTS provides free information about the
test. To discover more, go to www.atts.org or call 317-288-4403.
One of these honors isn’t better than the other; they’re just different
and give you something to do with your dog. Of course, breeders
use the titles to prove how smart, reliable, trainable, and beautiful
their breeding stocks are.
Owners of dogs that earn CGC and TT certificates or belong to ther-
apy dog clubs traditionally use the letters after their dogs’ names —
as in Manchita, CGC, TT, TDI, for instance. These titles don’t become
an official part of the dog’s registered name, however.
Getting Active in Agility
How much fun can you handle? If you’re thinking “a whole lot,”
agility may be the sport for you and your dog. Thousands of dog
owners swear that agility is the most fun you can have with a dog.
At agility trials, dogs are timed as they navigate a course that
resembles a colorful playground. They soar over hurdles, weave
through poles, stride across balance beams, sprint up A-frames,
play seesaw, and crawl through tunnels. Meanwhile, their handlers
point out the next obstacle in the path (dogs must take obstacles
in the correct order) and direct them through the course. Audiences
at agility trials are always encouraging, but when the crowd sees a
Chihuahua, the applause always amplifies!
Many owners do agility training with their dogs just for fun, but
plenty of titles await you if competition is your thing. Your Chi
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
168

could add so many titles to her name that it would take two
breaths just to say it!
Few people want to landscape their yards with agility equipment
(at least not at first), so most agility enthusiasts attend a private
instructor’s classes or join an agility club. Besides having the
attributes that a good obedience instructor possesses (see
“Choosing an obedience instructor” earlier in this chapter), a 
good agility teacher also
 Provides sturdy obstacles with neither rough edges nor a hint
of a wobble
 Goes slow and keeps the obstacles low, making sure every
dog and handler in the class has a firm foundation
 Provides new challenges by building on that foundation
Smart handlers know the rules of the game before they play.
Rulebooks for obedience and agility are available through the
organizations that sanction these events. Four major (and some
smaller) organizations offer agility. For more information and to
find a teacher/club near you, ask your veterinarian for a recom-
mendation, get info at your pet supply store, or check your phone
book for local all-breed dog clubs.
Therapy Dogs: Delighting the
Elderly and the Infirm
A couple decades ago, the scientific community found that inter-
acting with friendly animals is therapeutic for people. Since then,
polite pets have been welcomed at nursing homes and other insti-
tutions of healthcare.
Well-socialized Chihuahuas make top-notch therapy dogs because
they’re world-class lap-sitters. Lap-sitting is one of the most impor-
tant tasks of a therapy dog. But becoming qualified to perform pet
therapy isn’t easy. This special service calls for a pet that keeps
her cool in an institutional setting.
Therapy dogs must have dependable dispositions and impeccable
manners. Although a Chi’s main assignment is lap-sitting, she still
needs plenty of confidence to remain relaxed in an institution.
After all, she’ll be sitting on strange laps amid the distractions of
hospital equipment (like wheelchairs and walkers), institutional
odors, crowds, and noise.
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 169

Hundreds of clubs across the United States are dedicated to pet-
assisted therapy. These groups prepare their members through
classes and tests. At least two national organizations — the Delta
Society (www.deltasociety.org; 425-679-5500) and Therapy Dogs
International (www.tdi-dog.org; 732-340-0728) — have local clubs
or certified instructors in many cities. These resources are eager
to help owners prepare their pets for therapy work. Your local dog
club also may have a volunteer program.
The test used most frequently to certify dogs for therapy work is
the AKC’s Canine Good Citizen Test (see the section “Passing the
Good Citizen and Temperament Tests”). Some organizations modify
the test to include institutional equipment. A health certificate from
your veterinarian may also be mandatory (see Chapter 13).
Requirements vary among organizations and institutions, but the
rewards remain the same: Bored eyes light up and tired faces break
into smiles at the sight of your Chihuahua. And the warm feeling
remains with you and those you help for hours. But don’t take my
word for it. Give it a try!
How to Teach Your 
Dog a Trick or Two
Close your eyes and visualize your Chihuahua greeting people with
a paw shake, waving hello and goodbye, asking for a cookie (or
better make that a taco?), even dancing on her hind legs while you
whistle. Does that image make you smile? Good. Chihuahuas love
showing off, and it will surprise you how fast your Chi will learn
tricks when you start teaching her. So what are you waiting for?
Put some treats in your pocket and call your Chi. In this section, I
teach enough tricks to tickle your family and friends.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal

Serving the hearing impaired
Chihuahuas can and do help the hearing impaired through hearing dog programs.
After a training regimen where she learns to alert her handler to the doorbell, tele-
phone, alarm clock, smoke alarm, oven timer, or baby crying, the dog is paired with
a deaf person. The two practice obedience commands together, and the owner is
taught how to care for the dog. They then go home together and the dog serves as
the person’s ears. Because they’re so small that they fit anywhere and so smart that
they easily take to the training, Chihuahuas are popular hearing dogs.

The tricks in this section build on each other, so you should start
with the first one and move on only after your Chihuahua can reli-
ably perform the trick.
The benefits of trick training
Chihuahuas like learning tricks. After all, during training, they have
what they want most — your full attention, plus praise and treats.
A Chi thinks trick training was created just to make her feel special,
but you reap rewards, too. Besides giving you a chance to have 
fun and impress your friends, teaching tricks enhances your Chi’s
vocabulary, encourages closer bonding, and leads to better behavior.
Another advantage to trick training is that it makes your Chi an
impressive ambassador for her breed. Many people believe tiny
dogs are brainless and lack character, but a Chi that waves and
barks on command changes their thinking in a hurry.
Besides, after a shy Chi learns how to pull off a trick or two, she’ll
have something other than fear to focus on in social situations.
And making people laugh improves her confidence.
Pushing your dog’s 
performance buttons
When it comes to motivation, the happier your Chi is about learn-
ing a new move, the faster she’ll perfect it. So, if you’re a good
motivator, your dog can be a terrific trickster in no time.
What’s the key to effective motivation? Praise. But praising your
Chi works only when your tone is sincere and maybe a little silly —
okay, mighty silly with some dogs. Praising your pet in a drab mono-
tone won’t turn her on. It will sound similar to elevator music.
How can you make the praise so powerful that your Chi wants more?
Give it with gusto. Give your Chi a big smile when you say, “Good
girl!” If she’s a little lethargic, accentuate your praise with a little
applause. Use joyful words that come naturally to you, and say
them in an excited voice every time she willingly gives a trick a try.
Don’t become boring by using the same praise words and treats
every time. You can surprise her with new words. “Way to go, girl!”
“All Right!” “Yes, Yes!” Scratch her back. Give her a taste of cheese,
a sliver of hot dog, a bite of burger, or toss her a toy.
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 171

Read your Chihuahua’s reactions to rewards. Your praise should
make her eager to continue the lesson. Don’t make it so shrill that
it scares her or so invigorating that it distracts her.
Soon, you’ll discover which phrases inspire your Chi to try harder,
which treats she finds most tempting, and whether she’d rather
chase a squeaky toy or have a back rub. In other words, you’ll
identify your Chi’s buttons. Pushing them makes her happy, and
when she’s happy, she’s willing to try the trick again.
Putting her in the mood
Because treats are an important part of trick training, try to train
when your Chihuahua is hungry — before, not after, her meals.
Before beginning a training session, take her outdoors and give 
her an opportunity to relieve herself. When you get back inside, 
let her watch you prepare and pocket some treats. When you have
her undivided attention, start with something she knows. Have her
Sit for a tidbit (see Chapter 10). That sets the tone and puts her in
a cooperative mood to learn her first trick.
Don’t try trick training until your Chi can sit on command. Sitting is
a prerequisite to most tricks.
Using praise and treats wisely
When teaching tricks, use praise and treats/toys to motivate your
Chi, and don’t bark out “No!” when she makes a wrong move. When
she does something right, reward her. When she does something
wrong or does nothing at all, don’t reward her. It’s as simple as
that. Neither force nor punishment should ever be involved.
Reward every correct move, no matter how tiny or tentative, when
your dog is learning something new.
Shaking Hands or Gimme Five
If the Sit command is second nature to your Chi (see Chapter 10),
you can teach her to Shake Hands or Gimme Five (see Figure 12-2).
Just follow these simple steps:
1. Kneel down to your Chihuahua’s level after telling her to
Sit and say the cue word you choose.
Be creative. It doesn’t matter what verbal cue you use as
long as you use the same one every time.
2. Pick up one of her forelegs, lift it from underneath, and
gently release it.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
172

Praise her as soon as you drop her leg, and give her a tiny
treat.
3. Repeat the process five times and then try it again later
or tomorrow.
4. After she’s comfortable with you picking up her leg,
gently move it up and down before releasing it.
The big breakthrough comes one day when your Chi lifts
her leg as soon as you say the cue word. When she does,
let her know how happy you are!
Gradually wean her away from expecting a treat every time, but
always tell her what a good girl she is. And even after she performs
reliably for praise, surprise her with a treat occasionally. After she
has this trick down pat, you can have family and friends practice it
with her (but not more than five tries at a time).
Figure 12-2: Glad to meet you, Manchita!
Waving hi and bye
When your Chihuahua is able to shake hands as easily as a state
senator, you can start teaching her how to Wave. Use these simple
steps:
1. Use your cue words and ask your Chi to shake hands (see
the previous section).
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 173

2. Just as she lifts her paw, pull your hand away while
repeating your cue words in a happy voice.
Most dogs wave their paws in the air in an effort to make
contact with their humans’ hands.
3. The instant your Chi waves even a little, say “Wave” and
give her a treat.
Keep at it, making her wave just a bit longer each time
before she gets her reward. When she starts to master the
wave (see Figure 12-3 for an example of a master waver),
you can eliminate asking for the handshake by going
directly from Sit to Wave. Finally, you can wean her off the
treat by giving it only once every few times. But continue
praising her for every wave.
It’s also fun to hold your Chihuahua at chest level in both hands
and ask her to wave at someone. You can teach this trick the same
way, except that you need a helper. Hold your Chi while your helper
walks up; he or she should ask her to shake hands and then pull
the hand away to elicit a wave. Some Chis will wave with both front
legs when in their owners’ arms.
Figure 12-3: This well-trained Chi waves at a 
friend.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
174

Use the command Wave rather than the more obvious “Hi” or “Bye”
because it’s more versatile. You can cue your Chihuahua to wave hi
and wave bye, and you can personalize the trick by telling her to
“Wave to Aunt Amelia,” for instance.
Speak and Shhhh
Time to get silly! Here’s your chance to teach your Chi how to
speak with the following steps:
1. Start by showing your Chihuahua her favorite treat.
Wiggle it right in front of her but don’t let her take it.
2. Get her all wound up by teasing her with the treat.
3. As she prances around, say “Speak” excitedly, over and
over.
The object is to get her to make a sound (any sound).
4. When she makes a sound (even if it’s a wimpy squeak),
give her the treat and plenty of praise.
After she eats the treat, try again. Stop after five tries no
matter how much fun she’s having.
It won’t be long before your Chi makes the connection and barks
as loud as she can when you say Speak and show her the treat.
That’s a good start. Continue using the treat until you have to say
Speak only once. Gradually wean her off the treat.
The real fun begins when you get creative. “Speak to Me.” “If you
want a cookie, Speak.” “Speak to Aunt Amelia!” “Speak Spanish!”
Some Chihuahuas anticipate this trick and begin barking before
you can say the cue word. Every time your Chi tries that, tell her
“Shhhh” and don’t give her the cue (or the treat) until she quiets
down. Have her stay quiet for several seconds. After repeating this
process, she’ll learn that Shhhh means hush — an extra bonus
trick that can really come in handy if your dog is a problem barker
(see Chapter 11).
Dancing the tango
Chihuahuas make marvelous dancers, with moves that are the
envy of larger breeds. To teach your Chi the tango (or the waltz, jit-
terbug, two-step, or mambo), turn on your favorite tune or hum a
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 175

few notes. Hold a treat several inches above her head and say
“Let’s dance!” The object is to get her to walk a few steps on her
hind legs, so move the treat forward slightly after she rears up.
When she realizes what you want, it still may take several weeks
until her leg and back muscles are developed enough to let her
dance on her hind legs for several seconds. As soon as she can bal-
ance on her hind legs rather well, start moving the treat in a circle
above her head to teach her to turn. Soon, she’ll be pirouetting in
either direction!
What do you do with a dancing dog? Join in, of course! As your
Chihuahua swings and sways on her hind legs, start moving to the
music along with her. Having a partner encourages her to make up
steps of her own. She may soon add hops, skips, and jumps to her
dancing repertoire.
Touring the Dog Show Circuit
If you want to see more than a hundred breeds of gorgeous dogs
gathered in one place, treat yourself to a dog show. Besides seeing
beautifully groomed and trained representatives of all your favorite
breeds, you become acquainted with rare breeds that few people
ever get to see. Agility and obedience trials often are held in the
same venues as dog shows, too. Dog shows are fun regardless of
whether or not you understand the judging procedure, but a little
knowledge will make your first experience more rewarding. In this
section, I tell you about the basics of dog judging so you under-
stand what the exhibitors and judges are doing. Then I give you the
upside and the downside of the “dog game,” and I help you get
started in the dog show game if you want to become a player.
Dogs not entered in competition aren’t allowed at dog shows, so
leave your Chi at home when you go to a show just to check it out.
Rather than a dog, put a notebook on your lap and jot down your
impressions of why certain dogs won. Later, if you get into the dog
game, dig out that notebook and read what you wrote. Your first
impressions may help your handling.
To be eligible to show in conformation, your Chihuahua must be
 At least 6 months old
 AKC registered with full registration (see Chapter 4) or regis-
tered with the club sponsoring the event
 Unaltered (spayed or neutered dogs aren’t eligible to show)
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
176

When exhibitors compete at dog shows, they say they’re showing
their dogs in breed or conformation.
How dogs are judged and 
other show basics
Dogs don their finest fur when competing at a dog show, and with
so many gorgeous creatures to choose from, your first reaction
may be to pity the poor judge. But a dog show judge has help in
the form of guidelines, called the breed standard (see the Chihuahua
standard in Chapter 2). The standard describes an ideal specimen
of the breed. The judge’s job is to select as the winner the dog that
most closely conforms to this written description of physical 
perfection.
In other words, no matter how many dogs compete in the show ring,
the winner should be the dog that most closely resembles the ideal
dog described in its breed standard. Second place goes to the next
closest dog, and so on.
When watching a show, you see dogs of the same breed judged
together early in the day. But later, you see the winning dogs of
each breed competing against each other. That’s when novices
really get confused. After all, how can a judge choose between an
animated Chihuahua and an elegant Pekingese? Well, the judge
isn’t really comparing the Chihuahua to the Pekingese. Instead, he
or she is comparing how close the Chihuahua matches its breed
standard with how close the Peke matches its standard.
The following sections explain the order of the dog show classes,
how the elimination contest works, and what it takes to get that
coveted Champion title for your Chihuahua.
When you arrive at a dog show, buy a show catalog right away.
Then you can match each dog’s catalog number with its handler’s
armband number, thus finding out who’s who.
Winning or losing — it’s the judge’s call
Your first experience with subjective dog show judging may make
you feel a little confused. Most of the better-known sports are
judged objectively. During games of baseball, basketball, football,
golf, or tennis, you always know the score. But it’s different at dog
shows, where winning or losing depends on the judge’s opinion.
This concept can be confusing at first, especially when you see a
dog get a “Best of” prize one day and not even place in its class 
the next.
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 177

The more you discover about canine conformation and the
Chihuahua standard (see Chapter 2), the better you’ll understand
how each judge picks his or her winners. One judge may be a stick-
ler for movement. A superior head may sway another. Because
judges interpret the standards in their own unique ways, different
dogs may win under different judges. And that’s a good thing
because it lets many excellent dogs have their days in the sun.
Plus, dogs are judged on the day, or, to be more precise, in a moment
of time — something like the way humans judge themselves when
they confront their images in the mirror each morning. On Saturday,
you may smile and congratulate yourself on looking years younger,
but then on Sunday you may appear drawn and weary. Well, dogs
have good days and bad days, too, and a judge can only go by what
dogs look like during the few moments they’re exhibited. So, if the
owners of yesterday’s Best of Breed Chihuahua kept superdog up
too late while they celebrated, he may look like sleepydog during
the next day’s competition.
An elimination contest
Shows where dogs are judged on their conformation are elimina-
tion contests. The process of an elimination contest has many
steps, which I list here:
1. To begin with, all the dogs of a single breed (or variety of
a breed) compete with others of their sex in one of the
regular classes — Puppy, 12-to-18-Month, Novice, Bred-
by-Exhibitor, American-bred, or Open.
2. First-place winners of the same sex from each of the
classes compete against each other for Winners Dog 
and Winners Bitch.
3. These two winners are awarded points toward their
championship (see the section “Becoming a champion”
later in this chapter) and return to the ring for Best of
Breed (or Variety) competition.
Dogs that are already champions are called Specials, and
they also compete for Best of Breed or Variety.
4. Three awards are presented in the final elimination con-
test at the breed level:
• The top specimen is awarded Best of Breed or Variety.
• The best dog of the opposite sex than the Best of
Breed is presented with the Best of Opposite Sex
(BOS) ribbon.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
178

• The best of the two class winners is named Best of
Winners (BOW).
Sometimes, a class dog (a dog that isn’t a champion
yet) goes to the top and takes Best of Breed or
Variety, as well as Best of Winners.
5. When Chihuahua judging is complete, all but the Best of
Variety winners are finished for the day. The Best of
Variety Chihuahuas are now eligible to compete in the
Toy group.
The Toy group is where all the Toys that won Best of Breed
or Variety compete for group placements.
6. Following a group judging and elimination, only seven
dogs — the first-place winners from each group — are
left in the show. During the climax, they compete for Best
in Show (BIS).
When the show is over, only one undefeated dog remains —
but a couple hundred dogs may have earned points toward
their championships, and many others thrilled their owners
by placing high in their classes.
Only two Toy breeds, the Chihuahua and the English Toy Spaniel,
are represented by two varieties in the Toy group. The two
Chihuahua varieties are the long coat and smooth coat. Two other
Toy breeds, the Manchester Terrier and the Poodle, also come in
varieties, but only the Toy Manchester Terrier and the Toy Poodle
compete in the Toy group. Their larger counterparts compete in
other groups.
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 179
Group classifications
For purposes of showing, the American Kennel Club (AKC) divides dogs into 
seven groups as follows:
 Group 1: Sporting Dogs
 Group 2: Hounds
 Group 3: Working Dogs
 Group 4: Terriers
 Group 5: Toys
 Group 6: Non-Sporting Dogs
 Group 7: Herding Dogs

Becoming a champion
To become an AKC champion on the dog show circuit, your
Chihuahua must win 15 points, including points from at least 
two major wins (majors are shows where three or more points are
awarded). The two majors must be awarded by different judges,
and at least one of the remaining points must be won under a 
third judge.
The number of points your Chi may be awarded for going Winners
Dog at a show varies. It depends on how many Chihuahuas com-
peted, the schedule of points established by the AKC, and whether
your Chi goes on to win Best of Winners, Best of Variety, her Group,
or even Best in Show (see the previous section). The most points
ever available at a show is five, and the fewest available is one.
Your Chi must win points at a minimum of three shows to earn a
championship. Five-point majors are few and far between and com-
petition is keen, so most Chihuahuas are shown several times
before becoming champions.
When a dog finishes its championship, it’s permanently recorded as
a champion of record and is entitled to the word “Champion”
before its name. The AKC abbreviation is Ch, as in “Ch Manchita.”
The ups and downs of showing dogs
All hobbies have their good points and bad points. In the sections
that follow, I list some of the things, both positive (upside) and
negative (downside), you may want to consider before deciding
you want to show your dog.
The upside of showing dogs
Here are the many benefits that come with competing in dog shows:
 Competing with your dog is fun and exciting.
 You can make new friends with people who have similar inter-
ests, and you may be invited to join dog clubs.
 Many obedience schools offer conformation classes where
you and your Chihuahua can both make new friends.
 Depending on your goals, it can be a casual or an absorbing
avocation.
 Showing dogs is educational. If you go in with an open mind,
you’ll discover something new every time you attend a show.
 You get to meet the top Chihuahua breeders.
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
180

 Becoming seriously involved means you may become a breeder
(at least occasionally).
 Training your Chihuahua for the show ring strengthens your
bond.
 Showing involves traveling.
 You get the opportunity to learn from your losses to make you
a better competitor.
 Winning feels wonderful!
The downside of showing dogs
Here’s the other side of the coin — the disadvantages of joining the
dog show circuit:
 Winning at dog shows means you’ll need a dog with superior
conformation.
 Showing dogs is expensive and requires some special 
equipment.
 The alternative to training and showing your own dog is hiring
a professional handler, which is expensive.
 Training your Chihuahua for the show ring is time consuming.
 Showing can be stressful to dogs and their owners.
 Showing involves traveling.
 When you become seriously involved, breeding dogs becomes
a probability (at least occasionally).
 The sport can take over your life. Between conformation
classes, club meetings, dog shows, and breeding, showing
dogs can become all-encompassing.
 Losing feels lousy (until you learn to turn losses into learning
experiences).
Getting started in showing
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but no matter how handsome
you and your friends think she is, if you didn’t buy your Chihuahua
as a potential show dog, chances are she won’t win at dog shows.
Some dogs are rare exceptions, of course, but your Chi is probably
tops at exactly what you bought her for — companionship.
Eventually, you’ll need another Chi if you want to take up showing,
but in the meantime, make your companion Chi your compadre for
learning the ropes. Take her to conformation class and discover
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 181

how to train and handle her in the ring. She’ll love the attention,
and you can make your novice mistakes on her. This way, you
become a better handler for your next pup — the one you buy with
showing in mind.
Take your time purchasing a show-potential Chihuahua. Study 
the breed standard (see Chapter 2) and attend a couple shows.
Watching the judging helps you develop an eye for a show-quality
dog. Soon, you’ll find out which attributes are more important to
you, and which breeders’ dogs are strong in those traits. Then talk
to the breeders whose dogs you most admire and check out their
available show-potential pups. But don’t expect to get one right
away. You may have to put your name on a waiting list and fork
over a deposit (money alert!).
The following sections help you dive even deeper into the world of
dog showing.
For more information on showing, go to the AKC’s Web site (www.
akc.org). Magazines, such as the AKC Gazette, also keep you up-
to-date on dog shows held all over the United States. Many excel-
lent books on showing and how dogs are judged are available.
Preparing for what show dogs do
Assuming your Chihuahua is show quality and has full AKC 
registration — a requirement for showing — what’s next?
Besides possessing physical beauty and a steady temperament,
your Chi must take travel, crowds, noise, and strange dogs in
stride. She also must
 Stand still for grooming
 Pose while the judge examines her
 Circle the ring at a smooth trot in a line with her competitors
 Gait solo in the designated pattern
 Keep her cool from the first burst of applause through the
hush that settles over the arena just before the judge points
to the winner
Yikes! You know what to expect after watching a show or two, but
how will your Chi get used to all that? And how will you ever be
able to handle her in the show ring? Easy. You take lessons together.
Dog clubs and private instructors offer conformation classes where
you become familiar with the finer points of handling. At the same
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
182

time, your dog gets used to stacking (posing) and trotting (gaiting)
around other dogs and people. Check the Internet and ask your vet
and breeder where quality show training is available.
When you attend conformation classes, you find out when matches
take place in your area. Matches are practice dog shows — much
like the real thing except they’re informal and no championship
points are awarded. Matches are great for honing your handling
skills and getting your dog used to the show atmosphere.
Of course, many people hire professional handlers (agents) to show
their dogs. If you decide to hire a handler, choose one who has an
excellent reputation for taking care of and winning with Toy dogs.
Your dog’s breeder may be happy to help you locate and choose 
a handler.
Where’s the show, and how do I enter?
Your conformation instructor will know where shows are sched-
uled in your area, but you need some written material when you’re
ready to enter. The Events Calendar, a supplement to the AKC
Gazette, and a few other dog magazines (sold by subscription and
also found in pet shops, bookstores, and newsstands) list upcom-
ing AKC shows. They also include the names and addresses of 
the show superintendents you need to contact if you want to
receive show information.
The superintendents will make your mailbox bulge with premium
lists about shows in your area, complete with entry forms, fee
information, and closing dates for entries.
If your Chihuahua is ready to show, enter well ahead of the closing
date so you aren’t disappointed. Late entries are not accepted.
Speaking dog show lingo
Every sport has its unique terminology, and dog showing is no
exception. When studying the breed standard (see Chapter 2) or
evaluating dogs with other fanciers, certain words always come 
up. Knowing and understanding these terms early in the game is a
good idea. The following sections present many common terms
that float around whenever dog showing is the topic du jour.
Type
Type is what sets one breed of dog apart from every other breed.
The concept of breed type is easiest to understand if you remem-
ber that each breed has only one correct type. It’s type that makes
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 183

you instantly recognize the features that combine to make up a
Chihuahua. Type enables people to differentiate your dog from 
a Papillon, Miniature Pinscher, or any other breed.
And in the show ring, the most typey dog is the one that comes clos-
est to matching the characteristics described in its breed standard.
Soundness
Soundness is the ability to function well, and it includes physical
and behavioral characteristics such as a correct skeleton, proper
musculature, and a stable temperament. Also, no handicaps, tem-
porary or permanent, should inhibit the dog from using these
attributes. A dog that’s deaf, blind, lame, overly aggressive, missing
a testicle, or painfully shy is unsound. If a sound dog steps on a
smoldering cigarette and limps because her burned pad hurts,
she’s temporarily unsound and can’t be shown. But as soon as she
heals enough to move normally, she becomes sound again.
Not all faults in a dog are considered unsound. For example, your
Chi’s ears may be on the small side (the standard specifies large)
yet function just fine. Because having smallish ears doesn’t inter-
fere with her ability to hear, the characteristic doesn’t make her
unsound. However, small ears are uncharacteristic of the Chi
breed, so she lacks type.
Balance
Balance means that all parts of the dog fit each other without exag-
geration of any single part. The size of the head corresponds with
the size of the body, and height, width, and weight are proportion-
ate. If people look at your Chihuahua and say, “My, what long legs
she has,” or “Doesn’t she have a big head for her size?” chances
are she lacks balance.
Don’t fret over balance too soon. Puppies often go through stages
when they’re temporarily out of proportion, another word for bal-
ance. When your Chi is young, her head may look too big for her
body. She may have a well-developed front and a wimpy rear, or
she may seem to be walking downhill because her back legs grew
faster than her front legs. However, by the time she matures into a
good show dog, all her parts must be balanced.
Condition
When it comes to condition, the ball is in your court. You can’t
control whether your Chihuahua matures typey or balanced, but
her condition depends on you. A Chi is in condition when she 
Part III: Positive Training for Your Petite Pal 
184

carries the right amount of weight for her size (see Chapter 2) and
has an immaculate coat with a healthy sheen, good muscle tone,
clean ears, and clear eyes (see Chapter 7).
Style and showmanship
Style and showmanship are similar terms with respect to the show
ring, but they’re not quite identical. Stylish is the dog-show term
used to describe a dog that carries itself elegantly and with pride; a
good showman indicates a dog with a pleasantly bold attitude that
performs well during the judging.
If your Chihuahua has showmanship and style, she shows off her
breed characteristics, making the most of her typeness. Judges
recognize a dog like that easily. She steps out with pride — neck
arched, head up, aspect bold, happy, and eager — yet remains
under control. A good showman that lacks style, however, may 
still be appealing because of her saucy, outgoing manner, but she’ll
never fool a knowledgeable judge.
At a dog show, style often separates the superior from the good and
the winners from the losers — especially when all other points are
nearly equal. Style or elegance is a quality you can’t give your Chi.
She was either born with it or wasn’t. She may be typey, sound,
well balanced, and in fine condition, yet still lack style. That doesn’t
mean she won’t win, because a correct dog — especially one with
Chapter 12: Training Your Chi for Canine Events, Tricks, and for Show 185
Manchita’s showy story
Show breeders sell their top-quality puppies as show potential pups. That means the
pups appear to have all the attributes necessary to become champions. But poten-
tial is only potential. As a dog matures, things may change. That’s what happened
to my Manchita, a show-potential puppy that I got when she was going on 4 months
old. At 6 months, she still looked mighty fine, so we entered a show. She won the
Puppy class and then beat the other class winners for Winners Bitch. That day,
Manchita was awarded her first (and last) championship points. During the next
few weeks, her bite changed big time, and she matured with a wry mouth and the
habit of letting the tip of her tongue dangle. So much for showing!
Manchita’s breeders guaranteed her for show potential, as many top breeders do.
When her mouth went wry, the breeders were prepared to trade for a different 
pup and place Manchita in a pet home. But we wanted to keep her (and the timing
wasn’t right for raising a second pup), so we never asked them to honor the 
guarantee.

showmanship — wins her share of champion points. However,
what it does mean is that when competing against an equally 
correct dog that’s also stylish, your Chi will come in second.
Unlike style, which you can’t instill into a dog through training, you
can help your Chi grow into the best showman she can be:
 Give her plenty of socialization to bolster her confidence (see
Chapter 9).
 Lead-break her with praise and patience (see Chapter 9).
 Keep your training periods upbeat and brief so she doesn’t
become bored.
Follow this advice and you’ll elicit your dog’s best attitude.

ext to you, no one is more important to your little Pepe’s
health than his veterinarian. That’s why choosing his vet is
one of the more important decisions you’ll ever make for him. This
chapter helps you find a veterinarian you can trust with your
Chihuahua’s life.
But it takes two to save a sick dog — one to diagnose the illness
and prescribe the treatment, and the other to follow up at home.
Because the other is you, I also help you become the kind of client
every caring veterinarian wants — one who prevents problems
whenever possible, sees the signs of sickness before they become
severe, keeps calm (uh oh), remembers instructions, and carries
them out exactly as prescribed. Finally, I cover other important
health topics, from your dog’s first exam and his all-important vac-
cinations to altering your Chi and fitting him with an ID.
Choosing Your Chihuahua’s
Veterinarian
By now you know that all dogs aren’t the same. Toys like Chihuahuas
have special needs, and sometimes specific problems. Therefore,
you need a veterinarian who likes and understands Toy dogs.
Depending on where you live, you may have several excellent
choices right in town, or you may have to drive 50 miles to visit the

vet most of the Toy owners in your community trust. Near or far,
picking your dog’s vet is a major decision. Someday, his life may
depend on the doctor’s diagnostic ability.
Here are some of the better ways to find a good veterinarian:
 Ask your Chi’s breeder. If the breeder lives within a reason-
able distance, try his or her vet first. Even if the breeder lives
far away, he or she may have sold pups to other people in
your area and can tell you how to contact them for referrals.
 When you see people walking Toy dogs in your neighborhood,
ask them who they use and if they’re satisfied with the quality
of care.
 Call the nearest major veterinary hospital or the local or state
veterinary association (you can find them in the phone book)
for recommendations.
 Look for a veterinary hospital with AAHA (American Animal
Hospital Association) accreditation. These hospitals voluntar-
ily meet a high standard set by the AAHA and undergo regular
inspections to make sure they maintain standards. Going to
www.aahanet.org can help you find a local hospital that goes
this extra step. When you find a candidate, ask for a tour of
the hospital. If the staff is friendly and happy to show you
around, this is a good sign. If not, stay away.
Let your mouth, not your fingers, do the walking when looking for
a good veterinarian. Asking Toy dog breeders and members of a
local kennel club beats looking in the Yellow Pages.
After you choose a vet with an awesome reputation and make the
first appointment for your Chihuahua, you must decide whether
you’re satisfied with your choice. The right veterinarian will do or
have the following. (If the vet you visit doesn’t do or have these
things, you may opt to discuss your dissatisfaction with the vet or
simply change veterinarians. Many vet offices accommodate sev-
eral vets, so you may be able to change to one you feel more com-
fortable with in the same office.)
 Handle your Chihuahua with professional proficiency.
Whether your dog is everybody’s pal or shy with strangers,
your vet should handle him gently but firmly. A complete
physical examination needs to be performed carefully but
with practiced ease (see Figure 13-1). Steer clear of any vet
who seems rushed or rough or says or does anything that
leads you to believe he or she may not like Chihuahuas.
 Weigh him and take his temperature and a complete history.
This should include where you got him, how long you’ve had
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
190

him, his age, diet, vaccinations, wormings, activity level,
appetite, and previous illnesses.
 Explain the examination and discuss the results with you. A
caring vet may give you tips on how to improve your Chi’s
condition or keep him healthy over the long term.
 Answer your questions thoroughly in language you under-
stand. Any vet who purposely talks over your head or has an
arrogant attitude doesn’t need you (or me) for a client. Good
vets answer their clients’ questions in everyday language
without talking down to them.
 Make provisions for emergency care during weekends, holi-
days, and the middle of the night. Some veterinarians handle
emergencies themselves; others refer their clients to services
that specialize in emergencies. If your vet opts for the service,
make sure a vet knowledgeable in Toy dogs is always 
available.
 Have a pleasant receptionist and staff and a clean waiting
room. The exception is the small-town vet who cheerfully
operates a tidy, one-person office.
 Have an organized and well-equipped facility.
 Discuss fees. Although most clinics expect you to pay for reg-
ular office visits right away, you may want to ask about their
policies for unexpected, expensive emergencies.
 Be caring. If you sense coldness or indifference in the vet or
his/her staff, your pup is in the wrong place.

Being the Best Kind of Client
If your Chi becomes ill or injured, it takes more than an excellent
vet to cure him. It also takes you — a conscientious and composed
client. A dog does best if his veterinarian and his owner work
together to pull him through a crisis. The following list explains
how you can be the type of client a veterinarian is glad to have on
his or her team:
 Calling and making appointments for routine visits, such as
annual exams and booster shots.
 Arriving to appointments on time.
 Not asking your vet to diagnose your dog over the telephone.
Why no phone diagnosis? Because it can’t be done. A variety
of canine illnesses display similar signs. It takes a hands-on
examination, and possibly some tests, to find out what’s caus-
ing the problem and to decide on the best method of treatment.
 Having an understanding attitude when the vet runs late
because he or she had to drop everything to take care of an
emergency.
 Knowing your dog’s normal behavior and calling the clinic
immediately if something doesn’t seem right.
Write down your dog’s normal vital signs and keep them
handy. Yes, your vet should keep a record, but your Chi may
get sick while you’re traveling, and knowing what’s normal for
him helps an emergency vet make a better diagnosis.
 Bringing along a written list of recent behavior changes, if any
exist (for example: excessive thirst, loss of appetite, change in
activity level, unexplained fear or aggression, and so on).
 Bringing the health and vaccination records the breeder gave
you (for your first visit; see the following section).
 Keeping your dog on leash on your lap or in his crate in the
waiting room. Don’t let him play on the floor or sniff strange
dogs. It’s easy for pups to pick up germs.
 Being honest. When your vet asks if your Chihuahua has been
on any medication, don’t be ashamed to admit that you tried
an over-the-counter medication from the pet shop. Admitting
a mistake may make you feel like a fool, but your vet has to
know exactly what your dog has ingested to make a correct
diagnosis. Not only that, but mixing medications can be fatal.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
192

Also, if your Chi seemed slightly sick for several days and you
kept hoping that he’d get better on his own, admit that, too.
Don’t try to make yourself look better at your dog’s expense.
 Making a list of your dog-care questions and bringing it along.
Your vet should be glad to answer appropriate questions about
feeding, grooming, toenail trimming, and anything else related
to your Chihuahua’s health; however, he or she doesn’t have
time to listen to you ramble on about how Grandma Mildred
thinks your Pepe should be a television star.
 Taking notes when the vet gives you instructions.
 Following all instructions exactly. You must give medications
at the right time and in the correct dosage or they won’t work.
If you don’t understand how to administer a medication, ask.
Your vet can explain or demonstrate.
Never increase the dosage of a medication (not even a little)
in the hopes of making your Chihuahua feel better faster.
Medication doesn’t work that way. In fact, what cures at the
proper dosage can kill when overdosed.
 Staying as composed as possible, even during an emergency.
The more serious the injury or illness, the more your vet
needs you as a clear-thinking partner in your Chihuahua’s
treatment.
No matter how frightening the emergency and how fast you
want to get your dog to the vet, you need to secure his crate
for the trip so it doesn’t roll or slide while you drive. The last
thing a sick or hurt Chihuahua needs is a terrifying tumble.
 Not being argumentative or belligerent. Most vets care about
their clients and understand how deeply people love their
dogs. But vets aren’t magicians; they can’t guarantee that a
badly injured or gravely ill dog will recover, no matter how
skillfully they treat it. If you lose confidence in your vet, the
best thing to do is change clinics.
 Paying your bills according to clinic policy.
The Ins and Outs of the First Exam
The best time for a Chihuahua and his veterinarian to meet is
within 48 hours after you acquire him. In fact, breeder contracts
usually tell owners how soon the dogs’ initial exams must take
place; ignoring these contracts voids the guarantees. Although
most puppies purchased from reliable breeders are healthy (see
Chapter 4), the timely first examination is especially important for
three reasons:
Chapter 13: Visiting the Vet 193

 Your veterinarian either confirms that your dog is healthy or
gives you the bad news if he isn’t (I’m talking major problems
here, not a minor infestation of worms or a loose baby tooth
that needs attention). If something is seriously wrong, finding
out while you can still return the Chihuahua is better than
falling hopelessly in love with a puppy so sick that it can
never live a normal life.
 So the clinic can establish a permanent record of what’s normal
for your dog (assuming he’s fine). If he ever shows signs of sick-
ness, tests can quickly disclose deviations. Besides, why not
get to know your vet when your Chi is healthy instead of
entrusting your dog to a total stranger during an emergency?
 Your new dog probably needs vaccinations, a checkup for
internal and external parasites, and medicine to prevent
heartworm. I tell you more about preventative medicine later
in this chapter and in Chapter 14.
Unfortunately, people don’t always get to decide when to visit the
veterinarian. In case of an emergency, take your dog to the vet
ASAP. Speedy treatment often is the difference between death and
complete recovery. Call the clinic first and explain what happened
so the staff can prepare.
Here’s to hoping your first visit will be routine and painless. The
following sections dig deeper into the visit details.
Getting organized
Here’s a checklist of what to do before your pup’s first visit to the
veterinarian so you can get organized:
 Feed your Chihuahua a couple dog biscuits an hour or more
before driving him to the veterinarian. That may keep him
from getting carsick.
 Put a roll of paper towels and a container of wet wipes in your
vehicle in case a quick cleanup is necessary.
 Prepare a copy of your dog’s health record to take along.
 Collect a recent stool sample. You can use a resealable plastic
bag. (Some vets want you to bring one along for the first exam.
Be sure to ask about that when making his appointment.)
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
194

 Transport your dog in a crate. Secure the crate to make sure it
doesn’t take a tumble if you have to swerve or make a quick
stop.
 Bring cash or your checkbook. Vets get paid at the time of
treatment, and some of them don’t take credit cards.
Making the most of your first visit
Surely you have questions about dog care before your first visit.
The initial visit is the time to ask. Write your questions down at
home as you think of them so you don’t forget anything. To get you
started, here are a few questions new Chihuahua owners often ask:
 When is it safe to start taking my dog to public places?
 What do normal bowel movements look like?
 How often should my dog have a bowel movement?
 What’s a good balanced diet for my Chihuahua?
 How often can he have treats, and what makes a good treat?
 Does my dog need a vitamin and mineral supplement?
If you want to buy health insurance for your Chihuahua, the insur-
ance is readily available. Discuss this option with your veterinarian
or search for Pet Health Insurance on the Net. You’ll find many
options. Before buying a policy, be sure you know what it does and
doesn’t cover, what percentage it pays, and how to make claims.
For example, some pet policies are for emergency care only; others
offer wellness plans that cover annual examinations.
No coddling allowed
Even if the thought of your dog getting his first shot makes you
cringe, don’t let him know that. Be friendly with the veterinarian,
not nervous, or your dog will feel your tension and get scared. The
ideal attitude for the first visit (and those thereafter) is patient but
matter-of-fact. Hold your Chi in place gently but firmly for the exam-
ination and talk to him in a happy tone, without letting sympathy
creep into your voice. Consoling and coddling your Chihuahua will
only make him sure that something terrible is going to happen.
Your dog takes his cues from you, so if he senses that you’re
relaxed and like the vet, he’ll relax and like the vet, too.
Chapter 13: Visiting the Vet 195

Home again and more 
confused than ever
You and your dog visited your vet for the first time, and now you’re
home again, filled with new information — some of it different from
what you’ve read in this book. What should you do? Who should
you believe?
Trust your veterinarian. This book is a general reference, meaning
that it contains good, solid information about Chihuahuas in gen-
eral. But your dog is an individual that just had a thorough exami-
nation, and now you have personalized instructions. Follow them.
They’re meant especially for your pup.
Understanding Those 
Vital Vaccinations
Sorry in advance for all the gloom and doom, but for your
Chihuahua’s sake, you must know the worst conditions your pup
can contract. The good news is that modern dog owners are lucky.
They don’t have to worry about losing their pets to the host of
deadly diseases that wiped out dogs by the thousands just a few
canine generations ago. Today, the main focus of dog care is pre-
ventative medicine. The vaccinations your vet schedules are the
best safeguards to keep your Chi from contracting a variety of
potentially fatal diseases. This section breaks down all the 
vaccination knowledge you need.
Although vaccines often are referred to as permanent shots, don’t
believe it. No canine vaccine gives permanent immunity, which is
why dogs should get booster shots throughout their adult lives.
Different vaccines for 
different lifestyles
If it has been awhile since you had a new puppy, you may think all
vaccinations programs are similar. They used to be, but they aren’t
anymore. Today, dog vaccines are divided into core and non-core.
Core vaccines are the ones recommended for all dogs in a particu-
lar area. Non-core vaccines give dogs additional protection in spe-
cial circumstances. For example, if you live in the northeast part of
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
196

the United States and your dog is pretty much a stay-at-home pet,
your vet will recommend one series of shots. But if you and your
dog will do a lot of traveling, your Chi will need the extra protec-
tion of non-core vaccines (see the section “Just say ‘No!’ to other
deadly diseases” for more on extra protection; the other sections
deal with the most frequent core group).
If you plan to travel a great deal with your dog, tell your vet because
exposure to strange dogs and new places may demand extra pre-
cautions. Don’t take your Chi on any outings until you’re sure his
puppy series of inoculations is complete. Following his puppy
series, he needs a booster shot every year of his adult life.
Taking extra precautions 
for Toy puppies
Don’t be surprised if your Chihuahua’s vaccination schedule is dif-
ferent from the plan your friend follows for her Doberman Pinscher
puppy. Chihuahuas and other Toy dogs are more likely to have
allergic reactions to some of the common combination vaccines. In
fact, sometimes they come through their first vaccinations just fine
but then get sick from the second or third round. That’s why many
vets separate the shots and give tiny dogs their parvo shots alone
rather than in combination with other vaccines. The leptospirosis
vaccination also is an issue with Toy dogs, so discuss this vaccine
with your veterinarian. Depending on your lifestyle, it may not be
included.
Your puppy’s vaccinations must never be closer than two weeks
apart. Three to four weeks apart is ideal. Your vet will recommend
the proper schedule for your pup.
If your dog is allergic to a vaccine, a reaction (swelling around the
muzzle, difficulty breathing, or even collapse) usually occurs
between 20 and 30 minutes after the shot. If you live far from your
clinic, don’t drive home immediately after your dog is vaccinated.
Instead, stick around for about an hour (read a book or listen to
music in your vehicle with your dog on your lap). That way, imme-
diate help is just seconds away.
An allergic reaction to an injection is called anaphylaxis or anaphy-
lactic shock. The sooner treatment to counteract the reaction
begins, the better the chances of survival. Discuss allergic reac-
tions with your vet during the first visit.
Chapter 13: Visiting the Vet 197

What does DHLPP mean?
Although your Chihuahua may not get the whole combination in
one shot, one of the most common vaccines given to dogs is a
combination shot known as the DHLPP. The following sections
break down what the letters mean.
D is for distemper
Distemper, a highly contagious airborne disease, is the number-one
killer of unvaccinated dogs. Its victims usually are puppies,
although older dogs may come down with it, too. Because distem-
per manifests itself in various forms, it can be difficult even for
experienced vets to diagnose. Symptoms include some but not all
of the following: diarrhea, vomiting, reduced appetite, cough, nasal
discharge, inflamed eyes, fever, convulsions, exhaustion, and lack
of interest in toys, games, or attention. Although dogs with distem-
per occasionally recover, they may suffer permanent damage to
the brain or nervous system. Dogs that receive treatment immedi-
ately have the best chance of survival.
H is or hepatitis
Infectious hepatitis in dogs affects the liver just as it does in humans,
but humans don’t catch the canine form. In dogs, it spreads through
contact with an infected dog’s stool, saliva, or urine. Intense thirst is
one specific symptom, but all the other symptoms are similar to
those of distemper. Hepatitis progresses rapidly and often is fatal, 
so prompt veterinary treatment is critical.
L is for leptospirosis
Leptospirosis (or lepto) is caused by a spirochete — a microorgan-
ism that’s often carried by rats. A dog that has contact with a rat
can become infected, as can one that eats something contaminated
by rats. The result is a bacterial infection that’s capable of causing
permanent kidney damage.
P is for parvovirus
Parvovirus (or parvo) attacks the stomach lining, lining of the small
intestine, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, and in young puppies,
even the heart. It’s highly contagious and spreads through contam-
inated stools. Your dog may encounter the stools via their paws or
your shoes. Beginning with depression or exhaustion and a loss of
appetite, symptoms soon progress to vomiting, diarrhea (some-
times bloody), and fever. Puppies with infected hearts (myocardial
parvovirus) often die suddenly or within a day or two of contract-
ing the disease. Those few that recover may suffer chronic heart
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
198

problems. How severely adult dogs are affected depends on the
individual. Some dogs become extremely ill, and others just lose
their appetites and lower their activity levels for a day or two.
P also is for parainfluenza
Parainfluenza, also known as infectious canine tracheobronchitis
and most commonly called kennel cough, spreads rapidly from dog
to dog. It’s caused by several different viruses, as well as a bac-
terium. Symptoms are a frequent, dry, hacking cough and some-
times a nasal discharge. Other than that, the dog appears to feel
fine; many dogs infected with parainfluenza don’t even miss a
meal. Dogs vaccinated against parainfluenza sometimes get the
condition anyway, but they usually have milder symptoms than
unvaccinated dogs.
Although the disease usually runs its course, it’s more dangerous
to puppies than it is to mature dogs. Puppies should be kept in a
warm, humid room while recovering. No matter how old your Chi
is, though, your vet probably will prescribe antibiotics to prevent
complications and medication to control the cough.
Whether he’s 9 weeks or 9 years old, your dog needs to see your
vet right away if he starts coughing. It could be a sign of something
serious.
Rabies
Rabies always is fatal to dogs. And a dog with rabies is a danger to
humans and other animals, which is why law mandates rabies vac-
cinations. Rabies is a virus that can infect dogs that come in contact
with cats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, or other warm-blooded animals
that already have the virus. It affects the nervous system and is
generally passed from animal to animal or animal to human through
infected saliva — usually from a bite. Rabies also can infect a victim
through cuts or scratches that come in contact with saliva from a
rabid animal.
One of the first signs of rabies is a difference in disposition. A gentle
dog may start to act aggressive, or an independent dog may sud-
denly crave affection. Soon, the dog’s pupils may become dilated
and light may seem to cause him pain. Eventually, the dog won’t
want any attention and may develop stomach trouble and a fever.
As the disease progresses its symptoms can include bared teeth,
random biting, lack of coordination, twitching facial muscles, and
loss of control of the facial muscles, resulting in an open mouth
with the tongue hanging out. The dog’s voice may change, and it
Chapter 13: Visiting the Vet 199

may drool, paw at its mouth, and cough. Finally, it will slip into a
coma and die. All warm-blooded animals are susceptible to the dis-
ease, so anyone bitten by a dog (or any other animal) needs to see
a doctor right away.
Rabies vaccine prevents this dreaded disease. Your vet will give the
rabies shot to your Chi separately, not in combination with other
vaccines. Some rabies vaccinations are good (and legal) for longer
than a year, so be sure to ask your vet when your dog’s shot
should be renewed.
Just say “No!” to other 
deadly diseases
Besides the diseases you read about in the previous sections, your
vet may also recommend vaccinations against Lyme disease,
Bordetella, Giardia, Corona, and Adenovirus, depending on where
you live and your lifestyle:
 Lyme disease (spread by the deer tick) attacks nerve tissue,
joints, the heart, and, occasionally, the kidneys. Its symptoms
include lameness due to joint pain, loss of appetite, and fever.
Lyme disease is more of a danger in some parts of the country
than in others. Not only that, but veterinarians aren’t in agree-
ment about how well the vaccine works. Discuss Lyme disease
with your vet and trust him or her to make an educated deci-
sion about whether your Chihuahua should be vaccinated.
 Bordetella is a contagious and potentially serious respiratory
disease that breaks out most often during the summer months
when many dogs spend a week or so at the boarding kennel.
 Giardia is an intestinal parasite that dogs can pick up by
drinking water contaminated by feces.
 Corona is a virus that’s transmitted via the stool of an infected
dog. It breaks out most often when many dogs are kenneled in
the same facility. Dogs that travel a lot also pick it up much
more often than those that remain near home. Although this
virus can cause dangerous diarrhea in puppies (dangerous
because of the possibility of dehydration), adult dogs usually
shake it off in a matter of days. Let your vet decide if your Chi
needs protection from coronavirus.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
200

 Two types of adenovirus exist. One causes a respiratory infec-
tion and the other causes hepatitis, which can lead to liver
and kidney damage. Adenovirus vaccine may be the hepatitis
part of the core vaccines your veterinarian recommends.
These days, your Chi can be vaccinated against all these diseases.
But just because a vaccine exists doesn’t mean your dog needs it,
so let your veterinarian decide after consulting with you. (In addi-
tion to your vet’s vaccination schedule, your Chihuahua needs to
be on a regular program that prevents heartworm. I tell you more
about this in Chapter 14.)
Administering Medicine 
the Correct Way
If you can get away with it, giving pills in food is the easiest med-
icating method. My American Staffordshire Terriers gobble up a
cheese-wrapped pill instantly. It usually takes two people to give a
Chihuahua a pill, however. My Chi, for instance, eats the cheese
and leaves the pill on the floor! With your helper holding your Chi
firmly, open his mouth and place the pill as far back on the center
of his tongue as you can. Then hold his mouth shut while tilting his
head upward (careful, don’t cover his nostrils). Stroking his throat
gently during this step may induce him to swallow. After he swal-
lows, look inside his mouth to make sure the pill went down.
Opening a puppy’s mouth and giving him a treat on a daily basis,
from the first day you bring him home, will make it easier to give
him pills later in life.  
Liquid medication probably will be easier on both of you, so opt
for it if your vet gives you a choice. Use an eyedropper to give your
Chi liquid medication. Lift his lips slightly and place the eyedrop-
per in the back corner of his mouth, where the upper and lower
lips form a pocket. Hold his head up and his lips shut and squeeze
the eyedropper. Keep holding his muzzle, tilting it slightly upward
until you’re sure that he swallowed the medicine. Gently stroking
his throat may help.
If you get your Chi used to taking delicious liquid from an eyedrop-
per, administering liquid medication becomes a cinch. Occasionally,
melt a teaspoon of vanilla ice cream, put it in an eyedropper, and
give it to your Chi just as if it were medicine.

Spaying or Neutering for a
Happier, Healthier Dog
If showing in conformation (see Chapter 12) isn’t your game, the
nicest thing you can do for yourself and your Chihuahua is to have
your dog spayed or neutered. The following sections tell you why.
Prime time for spaying or neutering is when your Chihuahua is
between 4 and 6 months old. Avoid waiting until 8 to 10 months of
age to spay or neuter. Many dogs experience a fear development
period at this time, and a surgical hospitalization can plant an
ingrained fear of going back to the hospital. It can also lead to
aggression.
Spaying
Females spayed before their first season (usually around 6 months
of age) are at much less risk of developing breast cancer than
unspayed females. And because spaying removes the female’s
reproductive organs, spayed females never suffer cancers or 
infections of the ovaries or uterus. In addition, they don’t have
unwanted pregnancies and won’t drip blood all over your carpet
and furniture for several days twice a year!
Spayed females also are nicer to live with. Her sexy scent won’t
entice males to serenade in chorus on your front lawn, and she
won’t suddenly develop a desire to roam. Spaying helps to keep a
female’s disposition consistent and lets her participate in competi-
tive events such as obedience and agility without taking three
weeks off every six months (because females in season are banned
from performance events). In short, spaying your Chi when she’s
young gives her a healthier life, presents you with fewer hassles,
lessens the risk of a big dog mounting her, and doesn’t add to the
pet overpopulation problem.
Please don’t breed your female Chihuahua so you can get back
your initial investment or so your children can witness the miracle
of birth. A beloved female may need an emergency Caesarean sec-
tion or even die giving birth, leaving you with traumatized children
and orphan puppies. And as far as your investment goes, any emer-
gency will result in big vet bills, and raising even healthy puppies
is an expensive endeavor.
Plus, even if all goes well with the whelping, it’s common for one or
more seemingly healthy puppies to die one day to four weeks after
birth. This also can be very traumatic to children.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
202

Neutering
Neutering your male dog before he’s a year old can save him the
pain of prostate problems when he ages, including cancer, and it
makes him easier to live with.
Male hormones make dogs desire every female in season whose
scent wafts by on the wind, and some of the males perform
Houdiniesque feats to escape and find the female. Male hormones
also make dogs more aggressive toward other dogs and may 
contribute to housetraining problems, such as scent marking
(when the male urinates on objects inside the home to stake out
his territory).
Frustration (also caused by male hormones) is what may make a
dog embarrass you by making love to Aunt Amelia’s leg during
Thanksgiving dinner. Although neutering won’t immediately cure a
frustrated, aggressive escape artist with a housetraining problem,
it will eliminate the production of male hormones, which almost
always will start your dog on the road to improvement.
Chapter 13: Visiting the Vet 203
Myths and old wives tales about altering
Several myths and old wives tales about spaying and neutering began circulating
long ago, and every one of them is wrong. Here’s the real story:
 Spaying or neutering does not make a dog fat and lazy. Overfeeding and lack
of exercise do that. The truth is, altered pets are often the top performers in
competitive events. Neutered males can keep their minds on their work, and
spayed females can compete throughout the year without losing several
weeks because of being in season. In fact, almost all service dogs (hearing
dogs, guide dogs for the blind, and dogs that help the physically handicapped)
are spayed or neutered.
 Spaying or neutering does not prevent a dog from being an alert watchdog.
Neutered males concentrate on their homes better than males that have the
scent of sex on their minds. And spayed females alert to strange sights and
sounds every bit as quickly as unspayed females.
 Male dogs don’t get sad or resentful about being “castrated.” In reality, dogs
don’t have human feelings about romantic love and sex. Males never miss the
hormones that made them feel frustrated and constantly steered them toward
trouble, and females don’t feel unfulfilled because they didn’t have litters. In
fact, altered dogs usually become closer to their human families, which is where
dogs really want to be.

Slapping an ID on 
(Or in) Your Dog
The traditional form of doggie identification is a tag inscribed with
the owner’s name and telephone number attached to the dog’s
collar. Perhaps this would be enough for the nice family down the
block to see whom your Chi belongs to if he ever wanders out the
door unseen. But collars can come off and tags can get lost, so this
section presents two newer and better ID methods to discuss with
your veterinarian. They ensure that your Chi carries his identifica-
tion all the time.
Sporting a tattoo
No, you shouldn’t decorate your Chi’s handsome bod with hearts
or eagles. Tattooing is a relatively painless procedure that perma-
nently places an identification number on the inside of your dog’s
ear or high on the inner thigh of his back leg — out of sight unless
someone looks for it. Animal shelter personnel and other humane
workers know where to look to find a dog’s tattoo.
The tattoo links your dog to a registry where his ID info is on file.
Another plus is that laboratories can’t use tattooed dogs. Just
don’t forget to sign on with the appropriate national registry (data-
base) as soon as your Chi is tattooed. Excellent registries include
the following:
 AKC CAR (Companion Animal Recovery): Contact AKC CAR
at www.akc.org/lostfound or by calling 800-252-7894.
 Tattoo-a-Pet: You can access Tattoo-a-Pet at www.tattoo-a-
pet.com or call 800-TATTOOS.
 The National Dog Registry: You can get info at www.national
dogregistry.com or call 800-NDR-DOGS.
If you want to have your dog tattooed and your veterinarian doesn’t
offer the service, contact your local kennel club. Some dog clubs
conduct tattooing clinics, where a veterinarian or a trained club
member tattoos pets for a reasonable fee. Even if your local dog
club doesn’t offer the service, its members can tell you where
they’ve had it done.

Fitted with a microchip
The newest method of permanently identifying dogs is the
microchip. This tiny device (about the size of an uncooked kernel
of rice) is encoded with your pet’s identification information and
implanted under his skin (usually at the juncture of the neck 
and the withers) by your veterinarian. The procedure is similar 
to receiving a vaccination.
If your Chi becomes lost and ends up in a shelter, a device called a
scanner reads the microchip and identifies him. Although more and
more humane facilities are acquiring scanners, the problem remains
that not all of them own a scanner yet. Also, if the person who
finds him has never heard of microchipping, he or she won’t take
him to be scanned.
To be on the safe side, have your dog microchipped and use another
form of identification as a backup.

In This Chapter
 Battling internal worms
 Banning bugs and other external thugs
A
host of creepy-crawlies are looking for a free lunch and a
cozy condo, compliments of your Chihuahua. Some prefer
camping under a tent of hair; others want to set up housekeeping
indoors and homestead in the intestines, bowels, and even (hor-
rors!) the heart. In this chapter, I unmask these intruders and tell
you how to protect your dog from parasitic invasions.
The dictionary defines a parasite as an organism that relies on
another living thing for its survival but contributes nothing to the
host organism. That’s true as far as it goes, but many parasites do
contribute something in a negative sense — they hand their hosts
an array of afflictions.
Parasites that live inside their hosts are called internal parasites.
Those that stay on the skin are called external parasites. For exam-
ple, worms are internal parasites, and fleas are external parasites.
Just Say “No Way!” to Worms 
and Other Internal Bugs
Don’t be embarrassed if your Chi gets intestinal worms. No matter
how carefully you look after her, she can still become infested with
them. Heartworms, however, are a different story. These deadly
dependents are preventable, so if your dog is unlucky enough to 
be diagnosed with them, someone screwed up. Here’s the poop on
the nasty critters that may try to munch on your Chi.

Heartworms
Heartworms are transmitted by mosquito bites. As the worms
mature inside the dog (a process that takes about six months),
they migrate to the large blood vessels of the lungs and eventually
to the heart where they reproduce, blocking blood flow. Heart-
worms grow so big that as few as two can kill a Chihuahua. A 
single heartworm can grow up to 14 inches long.
Many dogs die without showing symptoms. Prevention is the only
defense, and it must start as soon as you get your Chi and continue
all her life. If you acquire her as a puppy, ask your veterinarian to
put her on a heartworm prevention program and then stick to it
without fail.
Even after she starts preventative medication, your Chi still needs
an annual blood test for heartworms. Why? Because prevention is
the best thing going, but it isn’t 100-percent perfect (and neither
are we, the people who have to remember to give our dogs pills).
In fact, if you slip up for any reason, you should have your Chi
tested before resuming her monthly prevention program. Why?
Because if a dog already has heartworms and takes preventative
medication, the combination can be fatal. In fact, if you acquire 
her as an adult dog, your vet must give her a blood test before pre-
scribing preventative medicine.
What if you acquired your Chi as an adult and she tests positive?
Now that’s a real bummer. On the plus side, you caught it while
she’s still breathing — and where there’s life, there’s hope. You can
have plenty of hope if you caught the problem early. Treatment
needs to start immediately. Unfortunately, the procedures to rid a
dog of heartworms are dangerous, although less dangerous than
the deadly worms. Many (but not all) dogs survive the treatment.
Good luck. After your dog is heartworm free, rely on preventative
medication to keep her that way.
Roundworms, hookworms, whip-
worms, tapeworms — yuck!
Many puppies are born with roundworms, and some get hookworms
and/or roundworms from their mothers’ milk. In fact, your Chi can
pick up one of several species of worms, including hookworms and
whipworms, when simply out for a walk. She may even ingest a
tapeworm while nipping at a flea that suddenly sprang from the
grass and landed on her well-groomed back, because fleas play
host to tapeworms. So what’s a dog owner to do?
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
208

Prevention through maintaining clean quarters and the quick
removal of internal parasites are the best policies. Prevention
works best if start as soon as you get your puppy. In addition to
vaccinating your Chi (see Chapter 13) and putting her on a heart-
worm prevention program, your vet also needs to examine her
stool to find out if she has intestinal parasites. After she checks out
negative for worms, take a stool sample to your vet at least twice a
year (three times the first year). That way, if one comes up positive,
you’ll get rid of the new worms before they become overwhelming
and endanger her health.
The symptoms of roundworms, whipworms, tapeworms, and hook-
worms are similar:
 Dull eyes
 A rough, dry coat
 Weakness
 Weight loss despite an enormous appetite
 Coughing
 Vomiting
 Diarrhea (sometimes bloody)
 A big belly (all the time, not just right after eating)
Most dogs have only two or three symptoms; others totally lose
their appetites when harboring worms. Occasionally, a dog may
show no symptoms at all but then suddenly becomes severely
anemic from a heavy infestation. Hookworms, for example, are
bloodsuckers and can kill a dog as tiny as a Chihuahua puppy
within weeks.
Don’t try to diagnose and worm your Chihuahua by using over-the-
counter medications. Many symptoms of worms also are signs of
other serious illnesses. Not only that, but different worms demand
different treatments. The amount of medicine is determined by your
dog’s weight, and medication is downright dangerous if misused.
On the bright side, getting rid of intestinal worms is a routine vet-
erinary procedure. If your vet discovers that any of these worms
are living inside your Chi, he or she may give her a shot or prescribe
medication and schedule a follow-up treatment. Don’t overlook or
reschedule the follow-up visit, because timing is important.
Chapter 14: Debugging de Dog 209

Giardia
Giardia are found in lakes, ponds, and other outdoor water sources.
Chihuahuas seldom contact Giardia because the protozoans (one-
celled microscopic organisms, not worms) are most often ingested
by thirsty hunting dogs and dogs accompanying backpackers —
not comfort-loving critters like Chis. However, your Chi can ingest
Giardia by an act as simple as lapping water from a puddle.
After a dog ingests them, Giardia chew on the inner lining of the
small intestine. Naturally, this creates irritation, which is accompa-
nied by the following:
 Inflammation
 Stools coated with mucous
 Weight loss
 Diarrhea
 Bloating
If you travel with your dog, Giardia should convince you to carry
water from home. But dogs can pick up the protozoa from licking
an affected dog’s stool (yes, sometimes dogs do yucky stuff like
that). If your Chi gets diarrhea after eliminating at highway rest
stops, let your vet know that Giardia is one possibility. Prompt
treatment is important.
Coccidia
Coccidia, another protozoan, lay their eggs in animals’ stools. And
dogs sometimes get up close and personal with poop. After they
get inside your Chi, coccidia line her intestinal tract, causing
 Watery stools and bloating
 Straining during elimination
 Vomiting
 Weight loss
 Streaks of blood on the stool
Is there any good news? Yes. Coccidia are easily diagnosed by your
vet and quickly eliminated when treated early.

It is best to pick up all feces as soon as your puppy goes to help
prevent your yard from becoming contaminated and a constant
source of reinfestation for your puppy. 
Controlling the External Pests:
Fleas, Ticks, and Mites
Fleas, ticks, and a mixture of mites are the most common external
parasites that annoy and endanger dogs. In the following sections,
I explain what you need to know to keep your Chi safe from a vari-
ety of bloodthirsty bugs.
Defeating the terrible tick
I give you the good news first. If you walk your Chihuahua in the
sunshine during the warm months and keep her away from tall grass
and profuse plants, chances are she won’t pick up any ticks. Why?
Because like Dracula, these bloodsuckers prefer darker areas —
especially the woods. But occasionally ticks appear in unexpected
places, and because they’re so dangerous, your best bet is to
check your Chi’s body daily from late spring through the end of
summer. It takes several hours for a tick to do its dirty work, so if
you remove a tick quickly, your dog probably won’t come down
with any of the dire diseases ticks can cause.
Dogs seldom get all, or even half, the symptoms that a particular
disease can cause. If you’ve found a tick on your dog within the
last two weeks, just one or two symptoms of a tick-related illness
warrant an immediate trip to the veterinarian.
Scanning for and removing ticks
When checking for ticks, pay special attention to your dog’s head,
face, neck, and the inside of her ears. Those are a tick’s favorite
lunch counters. Another choice spot is between the toes. But a 
tick can cling to any part of a Chi’s body, so run your fingertips
everywhere — up and down her legs, under her pits, and down 
her back, sides, belly, and tail. It sounds like a big job, but you can
easily complete the whole exam in a minute. Now aren’t you glad
you chose a Chihuahua?
Chapter 14: Debugging de Dog 211

If you find an attached tick, don’t try to pull it off by hand. The
safest way to remove a tick is with a preparation recommended by
your veterinarian. If you’re far from the veterinary clinic and don’t
have a preparation on hand, remove the tick with a pair of tweez-
ers. Some pet shops sell special tweezers just for that purpose, but
unless you live near the woods and have to remove ticks often, the
tweezers in your medicine chest will do just fine.
Grab your tweezers and follow these steps:
1. Separate your Chi’s hair so you can see where the tick
embedded itself in her skin.
The embedded part is the tick’s head.
2. If you have rubbing alcohol handy, put a drop of it right
on the tick.
That makes some ticks release their hold.
3. Use your tweezers to clamp down as close to the head as
possible and pull it out slowly.
Ideally, you’ll remove the entire tick, head and all.
4. Put a dab of alcohol on your Chi’s skin where the tick
had been.
Uh oh. You did everything right, but the tick’s head broke
off and stayed under your pup’s skin. If that happens, play
it safe and call your veterinarian for further instruction.
If you’re sure you removed the tick within an hour or so of when it
attached itself, your dog is probably home free. But it’s a good idea
to keep the tick in an escape-proof container so your vet can iden-
tify it in case your dog shows signs of sickness. Watch her closely
for the next couple weeks and take her to the vet if something
seems wrong. You’ll know the signs after you read the next few 
sections. They tell you all about the many miseries ticks carry.
Tick Bite Paralysis
The American dog tick (sometimes called the Eastern wood tick)
and the Western Mountain or Rocky Mountain wood tick all inject
toxins into their hosts through their saliva. Early signs of sickness
are weakness, fever, a change in the dog’s voice, vomiting, dilated
pupils, and lack of coordination. The clinical signs usually disap-
pear gradually after you remove the tick. But if the tick remains
undetected, paralysis, difficulty breathing, and death may follow
these symptoms.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
212

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is a deadly disease brought to your
dog by the same ticks that can cause paralysis. It occurs when a
tick injects a particular protozoan under the skin. Signs of this dis-
ease are a high fever, a tender abdomen, water retention (look for
swollen legs and feet), blood in the urine or stools, nosebleeds, 
difficulty breathing, and general weakness. Symptoms may not
show up until two weeks after the tick bite.
Lyme disease
Transmitted by the deer tick, Lyme disease occurs when a carrier
tick transmits a particular bacterium into a dog (or person) through
its saliva. An estimated 50 percent of deer ticks are carriers. These
ticks are also more difficult to find on your dog because they’re
small. The good news is that they must be attached for nearly two
days before infection can occur.
A dog with Lyme disease may become lame, depressed, weak, and
feverish; suffer painful joints; and be reluctant to move. If you live
in a rural area known for having a large population of deer ticks,
your veterinarian may suggest vaccinating your Chihuahua against
Lyme disease.
Lyme disease has currently been diagnosed in 47 states. It also
attacks people, so check yourself and your dog after a walk in the
woods. A preventative vaccine for humans is available and is prob-
ably a good idea if you live near a wooded area. Ask your doctor
about it.
Fleas are no circus
I wish I could offer you a quick and easy method for getting rid of
fleas, but unfortunately, eliminating fleas isn’t easy . . . not even
with all the new formulas that are marketed every year. The truth
is, fleas quickly become resistant or actually adapt to insecticides.
That’s why new flea dips, powders, and sprays appear on the pet
shop shelves annually.
With a dog as small as a Chihuahua, using any over-the counter
flea remedies isn’t a good idea. Instead, discuss your Chihuahua’s
lifestyle with your veterinarian, and he or she will prescribe a safe
and effective program to keep fleas from moving in on your Chi.
With fleas, prevention is key and earlier is better. Those bad little
buggers are capable of producing another generation every 21
days, and one female flea can produce thousands of eggs in her
Chapter 14: Debugging de Dog 213

lifetime. Not only that, but fleas itch something awful, often cause
an allergic reaction that turns into an oozing hot spot, and can carry
tapeworms. Dogs react to fleas in a variety of ways. A dog with a
fleabite allergy is miserable with just one or two fleas on her, but
another dog may have a severe infestation without even bothering
to scratch. Chances are, your Chi will let you know when she has
fleas. Most Chihuahuas scratch themselves silly when fleas bite
them.
The only way to control fleas is to eliminate them not only from
your dog, but also from inside and outside your home . . . and from
your vehicle if your dog travels with you. Fleas don’t live on dogs
all the time — they just feed on them and ride around for awhile.
Then they hop off and camp in the carpet, dog bed, or grass until
they get hungry and want to hitch a canine ride again. The best
way to terminate fleas is to interrupt the fleas’ life cycle through an
insect growth regulator (commonly called a flea tablet) that your
dog eats once a month.
You can incorporate this tablet in with the monthly heartworm pre-
ventative. If you live in a heavily infested area, such as Florida, a
monthly tablet and a monthly topical in combination is the most
effective way to prevent your home from becoming a flea hotel.
Flea tablets are prescription medicine, and insecticides for the
home and yard must be used with great care — especially when
you own the smallest of all breeds. Don’t try to come up with a 
flea management program on your own. The use of more than one
product often is necessary, and your vet knows which ones can 
be safely used at the same time and which products become toxic
when combined. And if you’re like me and prefer natural products,
tell your vet.

214
An easy test for fleas in the house
Finding out if your home has fleas is easy. Fill a large, shallow pan with water and
add some liquid dish soap. Before retiring for the night, put the pan on the floor and
place a desk lamp right next to it with the light cocked over the water. After you go
to bed, and the lamp is the only light on in the house, fleas will jump at it, fall in the
water, and sink immediately, because dish soap makes the water soft. If you find
drowned fleas in the pan the next morning, you know your home has been invaded.
Some people set this flea trap every night during the summer and say it’s a big help
in controlling fleas.

Your vacuum cleaner is your best friend when fighting fleas. Besides
inhaling the adults, it also sucks the eggs and larva right out of the
carpet and upholstery. Vacuum every room often when fighting
fleas. Just be sure to throw the vacuum bag away when you finish.
Managing mites
A myriad of microscopic mites, including one commonly called
walking dandruff, feed on the skin, blood, and even hair of a dog.
Your Chihuahua may never be bothered by any of them, but it’s
smart to be familiar with the symptoms. Chances are, your dog doc
will do a skin scraping (it’s painless) to find out what kind of mite
is making Manchita miserable. Don’t try to diagnose and treat skin
problems yourself. Some of them have such similar symptoms that
even your vet won’t be sure how to proceed without a test, and
each mite demands different medication. 
Saracoptic mange
Saracoptic mange, sometimes called scabies, is caused by crab-
shaped mites that literally get under your dog’s skin. After burrow-
ing in, they sip your Chi’s blood, mate, and lay eggs. These mange
mites make her itch. Symptoms are relentless scratching, tiny red
bumps, and patchy crusted areas. Visit your veterinarian before
she suffers hair loss or a bacterial infection. Scabies responds to
medication.
Follicular or demodectic mange
Commonly called red mange, follicular or demodectic mange is
caused by a different type of mite. Because itching is a symptom 
in some dogs but not in others, look for small, circular, moth-eaten-
looking patches. They’re usually found on the head, or along the
back, sides, and neck.
In young dogs, red mange often is stress related. Anything that pro-
duces anxiety — such as going through the hormonal changes of
adolescence or staying in a boarding kennel for the first time —
can trigger a minor outbreak. So, do mites crawl around with
miniature blood pressure cuffs so they can tell when a dog is
stressed out? Not exactly. The truth is, most dogs have some of
these mites on them all the time and never have a problem. But
when they’re under stress, their defenses break down and the
result is a small patch of demodectic mange (sometimes called
juvenile mange) — easily treated by your veterinarian.
Chapter 14: Debugging de Dog 215

Generalized outbreaks of red mange are another story. If your
Chihuahua ever gets a case of mange that covers much of her body,
have her spayed or neutered (if she isn’t already). Never breed a
dog with a generalized case of mange — the disease and its misery
can be passed on to the puppies. Severe cases of demodectic
mange are treatable, but the treatments are much more intense,
may include antibiotics, and should be performed at the veterinar-
ian’s office.
Ear mites
Does your dog continuously scratch her ears or shake her head?
She may have ear mites. These critters move into the ear canal and
proceed to eat the outer layer from the walls of their cottage (yup,
that’s your dog’s skin). Wipe gently inside her ear with a cotton
ball. If it comes out with rusty-brown or blackish goop on it, your
Chi has mites. These bugs are easily treatable when caught early,
so go see your veterinarian.
Walking dandruff
Yes, the walking dandruff mite has a real name. If you want to
remember or pronounce cheyetiella, may the Force be with you.
But to return to earth, does your Chi try to turn her body into a
circle so she can nip and nibble along her spine? Does she lie on
the rug upside down and wiggle around in an effort to scratch her
back? Have you noticed an abnormal amount of flaking when you
groom her? Those signs all point to walking dandruff, a mite that
devours the skin along a dog’s spine (and sometimes other places,
too). Your veterinarian can get rid of these itchy critters, but it
may take several treatments. You’ll have to clean all your dog’s
bedding and favorite rugs, too.

lthough prevention is still the best plan when it comes to
health care, being perceptive and prepared run a close
second/third. The sooner you seek help for a sick dog, the better
his chance of recovery. This chapter helps you sense the earliest
signs of sickness or injury. It also describes some hereditary ail-
ments that occasionally inflict Toy dogs and shows you the first-
aid basics so that you can act in an emergency until professional
help is available. With luck, this chapter has more info than you’ll
ever need. I hope you never have to use it, but it’s here for you just
in case.
I do hope you have to use one section of this chapter, however. It’s
about taking care of a golden oldster. All pet owners hate seeing
the signs of aging in themselves or their pets. Yet, as the cliché
goes, getting old is a whole lot better than the alternative. So don’t
let a little gray on your dog’s muzzle depress you. Your sassy senior
can enjoy a high quality of life for many years, and this chapter
helps you keep him in super shape.

Finally, I discuss the most painful fact of life: death. Losing a pre-
cious pet is heartbreaking enough without having to make sudden
decisions, so I discuss options such as euthanasia and different
methods of caring for the body. I also include some info on the
stages of grief and healing.
Recognizing the Signs of Sickness
Many signs of sickness in Chihuahuas, although subtle at first, are
symptoms that you may sense rather than actually see — the way
a mother instinctively knows when something is troubling her
spouse or child. So, if something seems wrong but you can’t figure
out what it is, don’t chalk it up to an overactive imagination. The
difference is probably an early warning, which is the best kind of
warning; quick treatment, before your Chihuahua weakens, has the
greatest chance of success.
If something doesn’t seem right, even if that something doesn’t
appear in this chapter, trust your intuition and take your Chi to 
the vet for a checkup. The following sections present a tiered
approach to recognizing signs and taking action.
Wait and see (but not very long)
Some problems go away on their own, but your Chi needs medical
attention if any issue continues longer than 24 hours. If your
Chihuahua has any of the following symptoms, watch him 
carefully:
 Refusing to eat anything at all but having no other signs of
sickness
 Limping, or refusing to put weight on one of his legs, yet
eating normally and showing no obvious signs of a fracture or
other pain or sickness
 Changing personality or activity level but exhibiting no other
signs of pain or sickness
 Mild diarrhea
The stool is loose but not liquid and doesn’t have any blood
in it. No signs of straining or stomach pain.
 Vomiting two or three times but showing no other signs of
sickness (plenty of perfectly healthy dogs vomit after eating
grass)
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
218

 Scratching or nipping an itchy spot or two but not hard
enough to break the skin
 Drinking and urinating more than usual but showing no other
signs of sickness
The average dog’s temperature is between 100.0°F and 102.5°F. He
has a pulse rate between 80 and 120 beats per minute and takes 20
breaths per minute.
To take your Chi’s temperature, use a rectal thermometer with a
rounded end. Shake it down below 100 degrees Fahrenheit, smear
it with petroleum jelly, and insert it carefully between 1 ƒ 1/2 inches.
Talk soothingly while holding him firmly, in a standing position, for
two minutes (don’t let him sit). Remove the thermometer and check
the reading. Disinfect the thermometer before putting it away.
Call your vet now
If your little Pepe has any of the following problems, call your vet
immediately and explain the symptoms in detail. You’ll probably
need a same-day appointment:
 Refusing to eat and seeming depressed or lethargic. He may
also be suffering from stomach pain.
 Suffering an eye problem. This includes excessive tearing; an
eye swollen shut or partially shut; or an eye that looks cloudy
or off-color.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 219
A little less hop in his step? Call the vet
Years ago, when I showed American Staffordshire Terriers, I had a female named
Frankie who bounded over obedience jumps with several inches to spare. One day,
at a Chicago show, she seemed a little less spirited than usual during breed judg-
ing, but she still started the morning on a high note by winning Best of Breed. Later
on, she also earned a qualifying score in open obedience competition; however, I
noticed that she just cleared the jumps with no room to spare. I wanted to attribute
her sedate attitude to a muggy Midwest afternoon, but it nagged at me on the long
drive home.
The next morning, I called the vet for an appointment, telling him only that some-
thing about Frankie didn’t seem quite right. It turned out that she had a uterine infec-
tion. Because I caught it early, it was easily cured, but if I had waited for more
evidence of illness, her problem may have become serious. What’s the moral of the
story? No one knows your dog better than you do.

 Breathing that’s labored or fast and shallow. May or may not
be in combination with a cough.
 Vomiting frequently, combined with depression or exhaustion.
 Incessant diarrhea. A liquid stool, combined with a terrible
odor and possibly pain and straining.
 Swallowing of an object without choking. A swallowed object
can turn into a life-threatening problem if your Chi can’t pass
it. The sooner your vet assesses the situation, the better.
 Swelling on any part of his body. It may feel hard and hot to
the touch or be infected and oozing.
 Scratching and/or biting at the skin until it’s inflamed, with
possible hair loss brought on by intense itching.
 Injuring himself, like a deep puncture that can become infected,
a cut that needs to be stitched, or severe lameness with no
indication of a fracture.
Emergency!
A real emergency is a situation so scary that your Chihuahua needs
the attention of your vet or veterinary hospital immediately — no
matter if it’s Sunday, New Year’s Eve, or three o’clock in the morn-
ing. The following lists outline the many emergency situations you
may encounter; for more on handling these issues, see the follow-
ing section.
Emergencies resulting from accidents include
 Broken bones
 Heavy bleeding
 Severe trauma (possibility of internal bleeding and/or shock)
 Burns from fire, scalding, or chemicals
 Poisoning
Emergency illnesses include
 Seizures
 Staggering and/or falling down
 Uncontrollable diarrhea (sometimes bloody)
 Frequent vomiting

 Breathing problems
 Allergic reactions
 Obstruction in the throat (choking)
 Obstruction in the intestine or urinary tract (straining to 
eliminate)
 Paralysis
 Heatstroke
 Bloat (extremely rare in Chihuahuas)
Handling Serious Issues: First 
Aid and Transportation
Emergency situations demand the service of a veterinarian ASAP.
In the meantime, handling your Chihuahua properly until he’s in
the hands of a pro is important. Keeping calm is the hardest part. If
a wave of panic doesn’t rush over you when you first see your sick
or injured pet, you’re stronger than I am. But panic won’t help him,
so take a deep breath and resolve to stay calm and think straight.
Then get to work.
If your Chi has an emergency, call your veterinary clinic (or its
emergency number) immediately and tell the receptionist (or who-
ever answers the phone) what happened. That way, the clinic can
prepare for his arrival. Then give him first aid and transport him to
the clinic. The following sections address this process with various
emergency situations.
Unless the clinic gives you other instructions for transporting your
Chihuahua, put him in his crate with a lot of clean, soft bedding,
secure the crate in your vehicle so it won’t slide or roll, and drive
to the clinic. Note: Be careful when handling a dog that’s in pain or
panicking. He will bite.
If you suspect that your Chi has been poisoned by ingesting or
inhaling poison, absorbing a toxic substance through the skin, 
or by injection (snake, scorpion, or spider bite), get professional
help immediately. If you’re far from a vet, call the National Animal
Poison Control Center hotline at 900-680-0000. The fee is charged
over the phone.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 221

Heavy bleeding
Use a pressure bandage (not a tourniquet) to control heavy bleed-
ing or blood spurting from any part of your dog’s body. It’s best if
you have a helper so one person can keep the pressure bandage 
on your Chi while the other drives to the clinic.
If you have two people, follow these steps:
1. With clean hands, apply direct pressure to the wound by
holding a gauze pad firmly against it for 30 seconds.
2. If bleeding continues, apply a second gauze pad on top of
the first and continue applying pressure.
3. Wrap your Chi in a clean towel, and with one person car-
rying him and holding the gauze pad(s) in place, go to
the veterinary clinic.
If you don’t have a helper, follow these steps:
1. Wrap a wide adhesive bandage around the wound and
the gauze pad.
2. Put your Chi in his crate with a towel or blanket around
him.
3. Secure the crate in your vehicle so it won’t slide or roll
and head for the clinic.
If the clinic is many miles away and the adhesive bandage
is around one of his legs, stop and check the foot below the
bandage after half an hour. If it’s swollen or cold, loosen the
bandage but leave the gauze pad in place.
Resist the urge to clean or wipe a wound while it’s still bleeding.
Stopping the bleeding is your first priority, and cleaning the wound
often makes it bleed even harder.
Choking
If your Chihuahua paws at his mouth, drools, seems unable to close
his mouth, coughs, tries to vomit, strains for breath by stretching
his head and neck, or appears frantic, he may be choking.
If he’s getting enough air to sustain himself, put him in his crate
and take him to the clinic immediately. If he appears on the verge
of passing out or if his tongue is turning blue, follow these steps:
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
222

1. Wedge something (the handle of a small screwdriver
works well) between the top and bottom molars on one
side of his mouth to keep it open.
2. Use a flashlight or put him under good lighting and look
into his mouth and down his throat.
3. Pull his tongue straight (careful, he may try to bite) to see
if the offending object is on top of it.
4. If you find the problem, remove it with your fingers or a
pair of long-nosed pliers.
5. If all else fails (you can see the wedged object but your
Chi can’t catch his breath), hold him upside down by his
hind legs and shake him (or pat him on the back if you
have a helper to hold him).
With luck, that will dislodge the object so he can breathe
again. Visit the vet anyway. Your Chi just suffered a major
trauma. (If you can’t see the object, follow the instruction
in the next section.)
Can’t catch breath
If your Chihuahua is gasping for air, his tongue is turning blue, his
breathing is loud and labored, or he’s not breathing at all, you don’t
have a second to spare. If he’s getting enough air to sustain himself,
transport him to the vet immediately in his crate. But if he isn’t
breathing, start mouth-to-nose resuscitation right away. Here’s how:
1. First try the methods recommended in the preceding
“Choking” section.
2. If he still isn’t breathing, lay him on his right side on a
table. Close his mouth and tilt his head back.
3. Keeping his mouth closed, place your open mouth over
his nose (you can do it through a handkerchief if you
prefer) and breathe five or six shallow (short) breaths
into it.
Of course you’re terrified, but try to control your breath-
ing. Your dog is small, so he doesn’t have much lung capac-
ity. If he starts breathing, you’ve saved his life. Now take
him to the vet for observation.
4. If he still isn’t breathing, keep giving him mouth-to-nose
resuscitation. Try to give him approximately 20 shallow
breaths per minute.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 223

Keep trying for a full ten minutes. When he starts breathing
by himself, go to the clinic. If breathing doesn’t resume by
then, he’s probably dead, but at least you know you did
everything possible to help him.
Broken leg
When treating and transporting a dog with a broken leg (or any
broken bone), your job is to get him to the clinic without making
the injury any worse on the way. Steady the limb (without pulling
on it) by wrapping absorbent cotton around the entire leg. Then
use gauze bandage, held in place with adhesive, to keep the leg
from moving during transport.
Heatstroke
Symptoms of heatstroke include rapid or heavy breathing, a bright
red mouth and tongue, thick saliva, unsteadiness (possibly falling
over), diarrhea, vomiting, a hot and dry nose with legs and ears
hot to the touch, and complete collapse — often combined with
glassy eyes and gray lips.
Dogs don’t sweat. The only way they can regulate their body tem-
perature is by panting.
To save your Chihuahua during a case of heatstroke, you must
start cooling him immediately — even before you call the clinic:
1. Take him to a shady or air-conditioned place.
2. Soak a towel in cool (not ice) water, wring it out, and
apply cold compresses to his belly and groin.
3. Lay the cool towel on his back and gently wet his head
with it.
4. Let him drink a small amount of cool water at intervals —
not all he wants at one time.
If he’s too weak to drink, wipe the inside of his mouth with
the water.
5. Call the clinic, put the cold, wet towel in the bottom of
his crate, and take him to the vet.
Although most emergencies are the result of bad luck rather than
bad management, heatstroke is absolutely preventable. Don’t
overexert your Chi on a muggy day or leave him alone inside your
vehicle. The temperature inside a car or truck, even one parked in
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
224

the shade, usually is 25 degrees hotter than outside the vehicle.
Every year, hundreds of pets die from being left alone in parked
vehicles for just a few minutes.
Reviewing Veterinary Issues
Specific to Chihuahuas
Although Chihuahuas have fewer genetic defects than many breeds
(maybe because so many breeders try hard to eliminate problems),
no breed is perfect. In the following sections, I present some 
idiosyncrasies — a few serious issues but most not — that are
sometimes seen in Chihuahuas and other Toy breeds.
Subluxation of the patella
Subluxation of the patella, or luxating patella, is a relatively common
problem in small breeds and some large ones as well. In dog lingo,
this defect is called “slipped stifles” or “loose kneecaps.” When it
occurs, the kneecap (we’re talking about the rear legs) slips out of
its groove — sometimes often and sometimes rarely, depending on
the severity of the problem. If your dog is unlucky enough to have
his kneecaps slip often, surgery may be the solution. A dog with 
a mild case can live a normal life, kind of like a person with a 
trick knee.
Hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia refers to low blood sugar and is a common problem
in young Toy puppies. Most of them grow out of it before they’re
old enough to leave the breeders, but for a few, it’s a danger
throughout their lives.
Symptoms of low blood sugar include a staggering gait, glassy eyes,
and sometimes limpness or rigidity. If the dog doesn’t receive
immediate help when the symptoms show, he can suffer seizures,
unconsciousness, and, finally, death. Treatment involves putting
some sugar in your dog’s mouth, calling your veterinarian, and
heading for the clinic.
When you know that your dog has a tendency to develop hypo-
glycemia, you can prevent future attacks by changing his feeding
schedule. Give small amounts of food several times a day and
avoid sugary treats (check the ingredients before buying dog
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 225

treats). Too much sugar in his food can put your Chi on a roller-
coaster ride of sugar highs and lows instead of keeping his blood
sugar nice and level. (For more on diet, head to Chapter 6.)
Collapsing trachea
Collapsing trachea is a problem for Toy dogs of many breeds —
mostly in dogs older than 5 years, but occasionally a puppy has it
from birth. The symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath,
and exhaustion. To understand the condition, think of the trachea
as a straw made of cartilage that carries air from the neck to the
chest. When the cartilage collapses, breathing becomes difficult —
kind of like sipping soda through a flattened straw.
Your vet can treat the condition with medication, but if you smoke,
your Chi’s prognosis may be poor. Secondhand smoke is a proven
contributing factor to the problem, and smoke tends to settle low,
where a little dog’s nose is.
Heart murmur
Heart murmurs are relatively uncommon in Chihuahuas. Thankfully,
even those that have one usually have the functional type. As in
people, that means they can be as active and athletic as they want
and live long, normal lives. If your Chihuahua is unlucky enough to
develop a severe murmur, your vet will detect it during his annual
exam. Further tests, such as an ultrasound and an EKG, may be rec-
ommended, and your vet will discuss treatment options with you.
Molera
The Chihuahua’s molera (or fontanel) is considered a breed charac-
teristic and not a condition or defect. Most Chihuahuas (80 to 90
percent) have a molera — a soft spot on the top of the head similar
to a human baby’s soft spot. But unlike babies, most Chihuahuas
don’t outgrow it. It usually shrinks as the dog matures and ends up
between nickel- and dime-sized. Your Chi’s molera won’t be a prob-
lem as long as you’re gentle when petting or handling his head.
In rare cases, the molera remains quite large and can be a sign of a
serious problem called hydrocephalus. The good news (for the wor-
rier, I suppose) is that hydrocephalus has several other signs
besides a larger-than-usual molera.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
226

Hydrocephalus
A dog with hydrocephalus (also called “water on the brain”) may
have an unusually large head for his size caused by swelling. Other
signs of this fatal condition are frequent falling, seizures, a lot of
white showing in the eyes, an unsteady gait, and east-west eyes
(the opposite of crossed eyes). A dog with this condition is in pain
and won’t live long, so euthanasia is the humane solution (euthana-
sia is the medical term for a humane, vet-assisted death).
Going under anesthesia
The possibility that your dog may someday need anesthesia is one
main reason why you need to choose a veterinarian who’s accom-
plished in treating Toy dogs (see Chapter 13). Although deaths
from anesthesia are rare and are usually the result of an allergic
reaction, the use of a sedative is potentially dangerous. Your vet
uses anesthesia only when necessary (before surgery, for example).
Prevention is the best course of action. Be sure to read about how
to clean your Chihuahua’s teeth (see Chapter 7) so that cleaning
them under anesthesia won’t be necessary. And when your dog has
to go under anesthesia (during spaying or neutering, for example),
ask your vet if any necessary dental work (such as pulling
impacted baby teeth) can be done at the same time.
Be sure your vet uses one of the modern gas anesthetics. They’re
much safer than the old-fashioned intravenous products. The most
modern gas is Sevoflurane.
Watching those eyes
An eye injury certainly isn’t a “condition,” but because Chihuahuas
have big eyes and live close to the floor, they’re prone to eye
injuries. Put several drops of saline solution in your dog’s eye if an
injury seems minor. That’s often all it takes to flush out a foreign
object that was accidentally kicked up by someone’s shoe. If that
doesn’t relieve the problem or if the injury appears more serious,
take your Chi to the vet right away.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 227

Keeping Your Senior Sassy
Oh no! Your Pepe is getting gray hairs. Even though he’s healthy,
rambunctious, and still in his prime, seeing the first signs of aging
is scary. But it doesn’t have to be. Keeping your oldster healthy
and happy isn’t hard at all. If you’re lucky enough to share your life
with a golden oldie, you can help him stay feisty by keeping his
infirmities in mind.
If you prefer homeopathic medicine for yourself, you may want 
to find out if it will help your Chihuahua. Excellent information 
is available at www.hpathy.com/veterinary/index.asp.
Acupuncture also has been known to relieve many disorders —
especially arthritis. You can read all about it at www.acupuncture.
com/animals/dog.htm.
Aid for your aging dog
Dogs age much like humans do. Even if your Chi has led a worry-
free life, one of the first signs that he’s becoming a senior is sprout-
ing gray (white) hairs (see Figure 15-1). They appear first on his
face, encircling his eyes and giving his muzzle a grizzled look. Don’t
let them spook you. Chances are your Chihuahua will have gray
hairs for several years before feeling the first creaky joint of old age.
Figure 15-1: Manchita is 11 years old and has gray and thinning hair (compare
this to her picture in Chapter 1). But she still plays like a pup!
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
228

Other signs of aging include dental problems, including the loss of
teeth. Eventually, your Chi may no longer be able to crunch his
kibble (dry food). One solution is to soften it by soaking it in warm
water for several minutes and mixing it with canned meat. If he
develops kidney trouble (or other organic or allergic problems),
your veterinarian can prescribe an easily chewed food made 
especially to ease such difficulties.
While recovering from an accident or illness or when suffering the
dental problems that may come with old age, your Chihuahua may
welcome baby food. You can find boxes of rice cereal and jars of
strained meats in the baby-food section of the supermarket. A com-
bination of rice cereal and strained meat (warmed slightly) may
entice your dog to eat when nothing else works.
Older dogs often are less tolerant of cold than even puppies are, so
be sure that
 Your senior Chi has a warm sweater for outings.
 You keep him away from drafts.
 You put an extra baby blanket in his bed.
And speaking of his bed, he may start spending more time in it,
preferring an afternoon nap to a brisk walk. I’m sure you’ve heard
the saying “use it or lose it,” and that advice applies to dogs as 
well as people. An older Chi still needs his exercise, although you
shouldn’t expect him to take part in strenuous activities. Make
your walks together leisurely rather than lively, and when playing
indoor exercise games (see Chapters 10 and 12), don’t be sur-
prised if he shuffles rather than speeds through the house!
No matter what speed your Chi chooses, playing helps him stay
mentally sharp and keeps his muscles oiled, too. Not only that, but
exercise helps him avoid obesity — a serious health problem in
older dogs.
Aching joints and other 
signs of aging
Arthritis often attacks older dogs, and although nothing cures it,
your veterinarian may be able to provide relief. Some ancient
Chihuahuas may not have severe enough cases to require medi-
cine, but they may need a little more help at home. If your Chi can’t
jump on and off the sofa anymore, lift him up and down. Same with
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 229

walking the stairs. And if he can’t reach his traditional easy chair
he sits in when he’s home alone, make sure that he has a place to
nap and stay warm while you’re away. Either build (or buy) a ramp
so he can reach his favorite spot or place a doggie bed by it for
comfort.
If your Chi were an older human, he would need bifocals and a
hearing aid. The problem is, this equipment isn’t made for dogs. 
So if your Chi always came when you called him but he suddenly
starts to ignore you, chances are he has a hearing (not a behavior)
problem. And if he was on the same elimination schedule for a
dozen years and then starts waking you up at 4 a.m. to take him
outside, he’s not just looking for attention.
Your Chi may become a crotchety old codger, too, detesting even
minor changes and become unwilling to make new friends (per-
haps because of failing senses or twinges of arthritis). Report
sudden changes in routine and disposition to your vet. Many prob-
lems can be relieved. Others can’t, and some of them probably
bother you more than they bother your Chi. After all, dogs don’t
agonize over the signs of aging like people do. As long as your 
Pepe still enjoys life and isn’t suffering severe pain, he’ll be happy
as long as you love him.
The branch of medicine called geriatrics treats problems peculiar
to aging; gerontology is the study of aging in people or their pets.
Coping with the Death of a Pet
Owners often know in advance when death is threatening their pets,
but sometimes dogs die without warning, leaving owners saddened
and shocked. Complicating the process are the decisions you may
have to make concerning euthanasia and a final resting place.
Understanding your options in advance may make things a little
easier. I hope this section will help you with your planning and grief.
Is euthanasia ever the best ending?
Euthanasia is the most humane ending if your Chihuahua is in
severe and constant pain with no hope of recovery. It consists of a
lethal dose of a strong anesthetic, humanely administered by your
vet. The injection puts your dog to sleep instantly and stops his
heart. Only you can decide when the time is right, but it won’t be
as hard as you think. Trust your instincts and what your dog is
showing you. These factors tell you when ending your dog’s misery
is the most merciful thing you can do for him.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
230

After you make that painful decision and make your final trip to the
vet, the receptionist will ask if you want to leave your dog or stay
with him during the procedure. Staying may be harder on you in
the short run, but it’s best for most people in the long run. Take
care of all the paperwork first so you won’t have to handle it
through your tears. Then hold your Chi in your loving arms while
the vet administers the injection. That way you’ll know for sure
that your dog didn’t suffer, and he’ll die peacefully, nestled against
your chest.
Do you ever get over it? Well, no. You’ll probably always miss your
Pepe. But someday you’ll be able to talk about his antics without a
tear in your eye or a catch in your throat. Instead, you’ll smile as
you relate some of your favorite Pepe stories. And you’ll know that
the good times you had together will never be gone. They’ll always
remain in your mental bank of happy memories.
Handling your dog’s body
Many people choose to leave their departed pets’ bodies at the
veterinary clinic. Usually the clinic notifies a service, which picks
up the body and cremates it. Several dogs usually are cremated at
the same time, and the cremains (ashes) are buried in the earth.
Don’t be shy about asking your vet how he or she will dispose of
the body. Some clinics have their own facilities for cremation, and
others have different procedures.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 231
Let him die while he’s living
One of the saddest sights I ever saw was an ancient Chihuahua named Sadie lying
on her side in a puddle of urine, with her hind legs and tail soiled by feces. Sadie’s
owner loved her too much to have her put down. When the owner had to spend a
couple days in the hospital, she asked my friend to care for Sadie, warning her that
the poor puppy (Sadie was 16) couldn’t stand up anymore and would have to be
cleaned up and force fed. My friend asked me to come along on her first visit, and
although we expected it to be bad, it was worse than we expected. We bathed and
dried Sadie, cuddled her, pushed prescription pills down her throat, got some
strained chicken down her throat the same way, gave her water from an eyedrop-
per, and covered her with clean blankets. Through it all, Sadie’s expression
remained blank. Her spirit was gone, leaving her miserable shell of a body behind.
Please don’t love your dog so possessively that it makes you selfish. To paraphrase
a Jimmy Buffet song, let him die while he’s living, not live when he’s dead.

Private cremation is another option. The ceremony may be handled
at a pet cemetery, a private pet crematorium, or your veterinary
clinic. You can keep your pet’s ashes in an urn, bury them, or scat-
ter them in a place your pet loved.
Some people prefer to bury their dogs in their own yards. You can
mark the spot with a beautiful perennial plant. This is an excellent
option, provided that it’s legal in your area. If not, pet cemeteries
offer burials, which can be as simple or as elegant as you choose
(and can afford). Because not all pet cemeteries are created equal,
look for one that’s neat, clean, and has been around for a long time.
Helping Yourself and 
Your Family Heal
Shock, disbelief, anger, alienation, denial, guilt, and depression are
all stages of grief. Most people go through every one of them,
although not always in that order. To help yourself through these
painful stages, you need to
 Understand that mourning the loss of a beloved pet is natu-
ral. Your Chi wasn’t “just a dog.” He was your dog. You had a
strong bond with him, and broken bonds cause broken hearts.
 Take time to mourn. Don’t tell yourself to “get over it” and
then bury your grief so deep that it eats you up from the
inside. No guidelines exist for working through the stages of
grief. Some people need more time to mourn than others.
 Make a few changes in your habits and decor. Put your Chi’s
bed, bowls, crate, and toys out of sight. Take his treats out of
the cookie jar and his leash off the hat rack. Because walking
him was probably one of the first things you did each morn-
ing, create a new morning routine.
 Talk about your feelings. Find an understanding ear — 
someone who also adored your Chi or who loves his or her
own dog deeply — and discuss your feelings of loss. Many
cities have support groups that help people through the pain
of losing a pet. Ask your vet for a recommendation.
In the days that follow your Chi’s death, don’t be afraid to say
that you miss him in front of your family. Encourage your 
kids to talk about their feelings, too. Look at pictures of him
together and recount his hilarious escapades. Tell the kids
(more than once) that he will always be part of them, because
the good memories they have of him are theirs forever.
Part IV: Chihuahua Care and Concerns 
232

Sometimes sadness may sweep over you at work, and your 
co-workers may notice. If they ask you what’s wrong and you
don’t want to talk about it, or you aren’t sure how they feel
about pets, just tell them that you recently lost a good friend.
After all, it’s the absolute truth.
 Read a book about pet loss.
 Give your other pets extra attention.
 Consider getting another dog. No, not a replacement. It’s
impossible to replace your Chi because he was an individual
and no other dog will be just like him. But you can love other
dogs, as long as you don’t expect them to act like your Pepe. 
If you think you’ll have a problem with that, you can buy a dif-
ferent color Chihuahua or a different breed entirely. That will
help you learn to love your new dog’s unique personality.
Also, be sure to tell your children that Pepe can’t be replaced,
but that learning to love another dog is okay. In fact, some say
the greatest honor you can give your dog is to love another of
his kind.
If your Chihuahua’s death was preventable, forgive yourself but
learn from the experience. Maybe you didn’t feel up to walking him
one morning, so you turned him loose “just that one time” and he
ran in front of a car. Or maybe you lost track of when his booster
vaccination was due and he caught a deadly disease. If you con-
tributed to his death, you’re probably beating yourself up with
guilt. But that won’t bring him back. Instead, face what you did,
learn from it, and go on. Give his death meaning by resolving never
to make that mistake again. After all, no one is a perfect pet owner.
Pet owners are just people who love their dogs but are occasion-
ally prone to poor judgment.
Helping your spouse and your children cope with the loss of a pet
can be soothing to you at the same time. One of the ways families
come to terms with the finality of their situations (and then go on)
is by combining their efforts and creating memorial ceremonies for
their dead dogs. You can hold a ceremony regardless of whether
you have remains to scatter or a body to bury, and you can per-
form the ceremony indoors if you don’t have a yard.
Explain the ceremony to your family as a celebration of your
Chihuahua’s life and all the joy he brought to your family. Ask 
each family member to think of why they loved your dog or some-
thing funny that he did so they can tell it during the ceremony.
(Youngsters who have a problem expressing themselves may want
Chapter 15: Dealing with Sickness, Injury, and Other Considerations 233

to begin a contribution with “Thanks, Pepe, for . . .”) Before the cer-
emony, the family may want to go out together and choose a plant
(indoor or outdoor, depending on the situation) to grow in your
Chi’s memory.
Never use a pet’s death to make a point to your children. Even if
you had to nag little Julie when it was her turn to walk your Chi,
resist forever any urge to say something like, “If you hadn’t made
him wait so long to go potty, he may not have had kidney failure.”
Grieving kids need compassion, not guilt.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
P
art V contains a few little topics that I think are impor-
tant (or fun) enough to have their own special space.
Here I include a list of ten questions to ask a breeder when
you’re looking for a new dog. I present ten sources where
you can ﬁnd much more information about Chihuahuas on
the Internet. Finally, I shine a spotlight on celebrity Chis or
famous people who have come to love Chihuahuas.

Chapter 16
Ten Questions to Ask
Chihuahua Breeders
In This Chapter
 Researching the puppy’s family and history
 Making sure your puppy is healthy
 Getting everything in writing
T
he best place to buy a healthy Chihuahua is from a breeder.
Beware of puppies being sold by middle-people. For example,
no matter how clean the pet shop seems, that appealing pup in the
window may have been born in a puppy mill (an overcrowded and
filthy facility that breeds and sells hundreds of puppies of various
breeds). The combination of poor breeding practices and lack of
human attention during the formative weeks can cause lifelong
complications. I concede that may not always be the case, because
the pet store could be getting its pups from a caring breeder. But
you may not be able to tell for sure. So, buyer beware — and buyer
be sure to get answers to all the questions in this chapter to
ensure that the seller is reputable and cares about the breed.
When dealing with a rescue organization, chances are employees
won’t know where the dog originated, but the person fostering the
dog can tell you the circumstances of the rescue and everything
that’s known about the dog’s health and temperament. Chapter 4
goes into much more detail about buying from breeders and adopt-
ing from other organizations.

How Many Litters a 
Year Do You Breed?
Okay, you’ve found some potential Chihuahua breeders. But how
do you recognize a good one? For one, the best breeders specialize
in only one or two breeds, and they never breed more puppies
than they have time to care for. And that means plenty of individ-
ual attention. Good breeders adore their pups, give prospective
owners the third degree, and may exhibit their stock at dog shows.
Their facilities are clean, their puppy play areas contain toys, and
their dogs enjoy being handled.
When a breeder houses more puppies than he or she has time for,
it usually shows. Two of the surest signs are spooked, unsocialized
puppies and dogs living in unclean quarters.
Can You Tell Me All about 
This Dog’s Personality?
Some breeders are more talkative than others, so if the seller you
visit needs some help getting started, ask about a prospective
pup’s position in the litter or how she’s been socialized. Good
breeders know all about each and every one of their pups, and
most of them will be happy to fill you in on a particular puppy’s life
story. Beware if the breeder hesitates when asked whether the pup
is dominant or submissive with its littermates, or hems and haws
about how she was socialized. Caring breeders can tell plenty of
stories about puppies no more than a few weeks old because they’re
observant when the puppies play together and make time to give
each one individual attention.
May I See the Pup’s Family?
After you’ve found a puppy or adult dog that twangs your heart-
strings, it’s time to meet your prospective pet’s family. Expect to
see at least the dam (that’s mom in dog lingo) and the pup’s litter-
mates (siblings). With luck, you may also see an aunt or uncle, and
maybe even a grand-dam or an adult brother or sister from an earlier
litter. Don’t be disappointed if you don’t see the sire (papa). He may
live far away, but his picture and pedigree will probably be avail-
able. There may not be any aunts, uncles, or older sibs on the prem-
ises, but buyer beware if you don’t at least meet the puppy’s dam.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
238

May I Test This Pup’s
Temperament?
If the breeder believes that you know how to hold and handle a
tiny dog (see Chapter 5), he or she will likely be willing to let you
test the puppy’s temperament. This involves taking the puppy
away from its dam and littermates, and possibly out of sight of the
breeder — for example, into another room or around the side of
the house. You can take this book with you; easy instructions for
temperament testing are in Chapter 4.
May I Have a Copy of the Chi’s
Schedule and Records?
Many breeders give new owners a copy of the puppy’s feeding
schedule and health record. If the breeder only offers to tell it to
you verbally, write down all the information. Making sudden
changes to a dog’s diet can be dangerous (see Chapter 6). Also,
your veterinarian needs to know what vaccines your dog has
already received and when they were given so he or she can set 
up a vaccination and worming schedule (see Chapter 13).
What Kind of Health (Or Show)
Guarantee Do You Offer?
Most reputable sellers offer some type of health guarantee with
their pups, giving you a certain amount of time (usually 24 to 48
hours) to take the dog to your vet for a complete physical. When
buying a show-potential puppy (one you plan to exhibit in dog
shows; see Chapter 12), find out if the breeder will offer a replace-
ment pup if the dog isn’t show quality at adulthood.
Is This Pup Eligible for Full or
Limited AKC Registration?
A filled-out and signed registration application should accompany
every breeder’s AKC registrable dogs. The form also has a section
for you to complete when you purchase a pup. Do it ASAP, enclose
Chapter 16: Ten Questions to Ask Chihuahua Breeders 239

the required fee, and send it to the American Kennel Club (the
address should be on the form). A registration certificate will 
soon arrive in the mail. Then, and only then, do you own a 
registered dog!
If your puppy has limited registration, that means it isn’t a show
dog (although it can still compete in obedience, agility, and other
sporting events) and its offspring won’t be eligible for AKC regis-
tration (see Chapter 4 for more).
Will I Receive a Registration
Application When I Buy?
If you want an AKC-registered dog and the seller doesn’t have a
registration application ready to go with your puppy, proceed with
caution. Yes, it’s possible that the paperwork is still at the AKC
offices and will arrive soon. If you trust the seller enough to take
the puppy with papers pending, you should request a bill of sale
signed by the seller that includes your dog’s breed, date of birth,
sex, and color — as well as the registered names and AKC numbers
of the dog’s sire and dam, and the full name and address of the
breeder. If the important paperwork doesn’t show up in a week or
so and you want to contact the AKC, you’ll be able to identify your
dog with all the information from the bill of sale.
Most breeders automatically offer a copy of the puppy’s pedigree.
The pedigree is the Chi’s family tree, and it gives more information
than just names. If any of her ancestors were illustrious in the
show, obedience, or agility ring, abbreviations of their titles may
be included, too. For details, check out Chapter 4, or ask the proud
breeder to decipher the mysterious letters.
What Dog Clubs Do You Belong 
to and Recommend?
Most (but not all) good breeders belong to a dog club or two. For
example, Chihuahua breeders often are members of the Chihuahua
Club of America, and possibly local all-breed dog clubs as well.
Membership in a dog club is a good sign that you’re dealing with a
serious breeder, but not everyone is a “joiner.” So, don’t pass up 
a puppy that makes your heart sing just because its breeder didn’t
join a dog club.

May I Call or E-mail You for
Advice After We Get Home?
Make sure the breeder you choose is willing to be a source of infor-
mation after the purchase — someone who can give you advice
about the breed, its training, and so on. A caring breeder may ask
you to keep him or her posted on the puppy’s progress. Steer clear
of any that hem and haw when you ask if you can use them as
resources to help you raise your new puppy.

Ten Web Sites Where
Chihuahua Lovers Gather
In This Chapter
 Finding clubs for Chihuahua lovers
 Gathering info on Chis and Chi breeders
 Adopting a homeless Chi
 Enjoying just-for-fun stuff for people and their dogs
T
he Internet is often called the “Information Superhighway”
because you can find info about everything and anything while
cruising along its wide lanes. But, like the gorgeous Alaska Highway,
the Net can suddenly disintegrate into dirt and deep ruts, so you
need to navigate with care and avoid some sites altogether. The
problem is, people can say anything they please on the Net because
they don’t have editors to make sure the info is useful or even cor-
rect. When I type the word Chihuahua into a search engine, I come
up with 1,280,000 matches. Naturally, that figure changes daily. In
this chapter, I present a few of my favorite sites to start you on your
way. I’m sure you’ll find many more worthy sites as you cruise along,
so keep on trucking (I mean, clicking!).
The Chihuahua Club 
of America
The Chihuahua Club of America (www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.
com) is the national parent club for the Chihuahua breed under the
American Kennel Club (AKC; see Chapter 2). The site includes the
breed’s official standard, breed rescue referral, and myriad helpful

articles about topics such as puppy care and health. For added
interest, you can read the club’s official statements on the molera
(the soft spot on top of many Chihuahuas’ heads) and the use of
the term “tea cup” when describing a Chihuahua’s size.
Traveling with your Chihuahua? Check out the CCA’s guidelines for
staying in hotels/motels with your dog.
The American Kennel Club
Settle down and get ready to surf at the American Kennel Club’s site
(AKC; www.akc.org). Here you can find information on dogs in
general, as well as Chihuahuas in particular. The site includes 
info on every one of the over 150 AKC-recognized breeds, help 
with AKC registration, downloadable forms, breeder referrals,
breed rescue info, and upcoming events (including dog shows,
obedience, and agility trials; see Chapter 12). And that’s just the
beginning:
 You can click on Customer Service for a wealth of help, includ-
ing an advice column.
 If you have children, they’ll enjoy the fun facts and activities
on the Kids Corner page, where Bailey the Beagle answers
readers’ questions about dogs.
 Do you have animal-loving kids in high school? Teenagers
planning a career that involves dog care will benefit from the
For Juniors section, which includes scholarship info.
Truth is, after you click on the AKC site, you can spend several
entertaining hours reading about purebred dogs and their activi-
ties. Have you ever seen a Spinone Italiano? No, it isn’t on the
menu at the Olive Garden. Look it up at the AKC site — a fact-filled,
fun place to learn about dogs.
Chihuahua FAQ
The Chihuahua FAQ site (www.chihuahuafaq.com) is written by
Michele Welton, an obedience instructor and behavioral consult-
ant. On the site, she answers frequently asked questions about
buying, training, and living with a Chihuahua, as well as dogs in
general. She also discusses Chihuahua rescue and has a Chihuahua
blog where she discusses various topics about the breed at her
own discretion.

Chihuahua Rescue 
and Transport, Inc.
Chihuahua Rescue and Transport (CRT; www.chihuahua-rescue.
com) is a network of volunteers dedicated to the welfare and rescue
of Chihuahuas in the United States. On the site, you can see photos
and information about the Chihuahuas currently available for
adoption. Besides rescue and adoption information, the site pro-
vides an online newsletter.
It’s also a super site for finding that special something to show off
your favorite breed. Merchandise includes a Chi Gang Beach Party
T-shirt, a Chi Pride T-shirt, tote bags, towels, and even Poppy’s
Pouch — a beloved bed for many Chihuahuas. The profits help
homeless Chis, too! Beware: When reading CRT’s rescue stories, be
sure to have a box of tissues handy. You’ll need them. If you want
to be a part of this caring group, read the site’s info on becoming a
volunteer.
Canadian Chihuahua 
Rescue and Transport
Canadian Chihuahua Rescue and Transport (a sister organization
to CRT; www.ccrt.net) rescues, fosters, and provides veterinary
care for homeless, abandoned, and abused Chihuahuas in Canada.
Its site provides detailed profiles of dogs available for rescue,
matches homeless Chis with carefully screened adoptive homes,
and provides follow-up support for new owners. Educating the
public about the Chi breed is a high priority. And for a good read,
you can check out the heartwarming stories of successful rescues.
If you want to help, the site provides info about becoming a volun-
teer; it also posts a link to CRT in the United States.
Everwonder
Remember when restaurant chain Taco Bell’s ads featured a sassy,
talking Chihuahua? Well, her name is Gidget and she was a girl dog
playing a boy dog! At the Everwonder site (www.everwonder.com/
david/tacobelldog.html), Gidget fans can view old Taco Bell
commercials to their hearts’ content. Features on the site include
audio and video clips of all your favorite ads, tales of Gidget and
her body doubles on the set, and much more.
Chapter 17: Ten Web Sites Where Chihuahua Lovers Gather 245

Breeders.net
Looking for a good Chihuahua breeder? Go to www.breeders.net,
click Find Dog Breeders, and then click Chihuahua from the breed
list. Now enter your zip code and click Fetch! The site will provide
a list of the Chi breeders nearest you.
If you’re shopping for your first dog, read the information on the
How to Find a Dog page. The authors of this site explain the differ-
ences between good and bad breeding practices, give you tips on
selecting the right dog for you, and remind you that being listed on
this site is no guarantee of quality. In other words, you need to
check out potential breeders for yourself. But that’s okay. You can
find out how to do that in Chapter 4.
Agility Ability
Discover the exciting sport of agility — including its history, a
description of the obstacles, and some of the terrific dogs that
have garnered great scores — at www.agilityability.com. To
see photos of Chihuahuas training for agility and of the few fearless
Chis that have earned agility titles, click on Agility Chihuahuas.
(For more on agility and other competition, see Chapter 12.)

ing. You also can find info on the Chi personality and more, 
including breeder and rescue advice, tips, and a blog.
Wikipedia and Wikimedia
Commons
If you search for Chihuahuas in Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com),
the free Internet encyclopedia, you’ll find a wealth of breed info,
including temperament, health, and fame articles. It’s always a
good idea to double-check anything of importance that you read 
at this site, though. You can also scroll down to the Wikimedia
Commons box, click Chihuahuas, and get rewarded with plenty 
of lovely photos of your favorite breed!

Chapter 18
Ten (Or So) Famous
Chihuahuas
In This Chapter
 Meeting Chihuahua actors, performers, and “authors”
 Catching up with an inspiring Chihuahua
 Discovering dog stars and stars’ dogs
T
hanks to television and movies, most of today’s pop culture
enthusiasts admire, or at least are amused by, famous
Chihuahuas. Yet, artists and entertainers adored this bright breed
long before television was invented and movies made over 100 mil-
lion dollars in a weekend. In this chapter, I tell you about diminu-
tive dog stars and celebrity Chi owners. But choosing only ten of
them is just too hard, so I cheat a little and stuff several human
stars and their Chihuahua companions under one heading!
Tinkerbell Hilton
Hotel heiress Paris Hilton has Tinkerbell, a Chihuahua that shares
plane rides and goes to restaurants and interviews with her.
Tinkerbell was a familiar character on the old reality show The
Simple Life, and has even “written” a book, The Tinkerbell Hilton
Diaries: My Life Tailing Paris Hilton (Grand Central Publishing), 
as told to D. Resin.

Bruiser
In the movie Legally Blonde, Elle Woods, played by Reese Wither-
spoon, attends Harvard University with her plucky Chihuahua
Bruiser (whose real name is Moonie). Bruiser/Moonie also is fea-
tured in Legally Blonde 2, where he’s present in the courtroom
while his mistress pleads cases!
Wheely Willy
The subject of two best-selling children’s books (including How
Willy Got His Wings [Doral], by Deborah Turner), Wheely Willy is a
real-life paraplegic Chihuahua that gets around via a canine “wheel-
chair,” which allows him to move freely on his front legs while
wheels roll on behind him. Originally found abandoned in a box
with a cut throat and spinal injuries, Willy was eventually adopted
by pet groomer (and author!) Deborah Turner. She tried to rig
something that would give Willie the gift of autonomous move-
ment, but she failed until she saw an ad for the K-9 Cart. Now
Willy’s can-do attitude inspires others as he visits hospitals and
institutions around the globe and participates in local events (he’s
from Long Beach, California), such as the Los Angeles Marathon
and the Cystic Fibrosis Fun Walk. Willy has also made several
appearances on the Animal Planet television network!
Gidget
Gidget, Taco Bell’s talking dog star, retired from the advertising
business in 2000 after a long and successful career as chief spokes-
dog for the fast-food chain. But it seems like only yesterday!
She played a cool-guy role and did her own stunt work, which
included riding on Godzilla’s tail, running up a fire escape, riding a
skateboard, and jumping on a taxi cab. She loved riding in limos,
and she had her own line of drinking cups, T-shirts, and talking
toys. She even had two male stand-ins! But despite all her fame,
this diva was easily pleased and willingly worked for chicken and
steak bits. Ay Chihuahua!
Gidget was born December 8, 1994, and is owned by animal trainer
Sue Chipperton, who acquired Gidget as a pup and trained her for
stardom. Her expressive face appeared in a print campaign for The
Limited, and she had a “carry on” role in the movie The Fan with
Part V: The Part of Tens 
248

Robert De Niro before becoming the hottest commercial canine
since Spuds McKenzie. Following her Taco Bell adventures, Gidget
appeared in another movie. She played Bruiser’s mother in Legally
Blonde 2!
Mojo
Perhaps you’ve seen the gutsy Chihuahua called Mojo in the action
movie Transformers. His name is Chester in real life, and he’s quite
the spark plug. One of his several scenes included him lifting his
leg and relieving himself on an evil transformer’s foot!
Xavier Cugat’s Dogs
Xavier Cugat, a popular Latin American band leader during the
1930s and ’40s, liked to take his Chihuahuas on stage with him. He
often held a Chi in one hand while conducting his band with the
other. According to a popular (and possibly true) story, he once
dressed a Chi like a baby, complete with a bonnet, so he could
smuggle it into his hotel room.
Caranza
Owen Wister, author of The Virginian (Scribner), owned Chihuahuas.
One of his dogs was named Caranza, the Chihuahua breed’s first
sire of renown. Two lines of top-winning Chihuahuas, Perrito and
Meron, trace their roots to Caranza.
Tulip
Paula Abdul, of American Idol and pop singing fame, owns three
Chihuahuas; named Thumbelina, Tinkerbell (yes, another one),
and Tulip. Just before the sixth season finale of American Idol, in
May of 2007, Abdul tore cartilage in her nose, fractured her toe,
and suffered multiple bruises when she took a bad tumble while
trying to avoid stepping on Tulip. The dog wasn’t hurt, and Abdul,
although sore, finished the season. In the process, Tulip became
famous!
Chapter 18: Ten (Or So) Famous Chihuahuas 249

Don Giovanni
Do you like to read novels about the mob? If so, would you like to
read some that are suspenseful and hilarious at the same time and,
best yet, have a Chihuahua as one of the characters? Then look for
books by Laurence Shames. But don’t expect the Chihuahua in the
books to be bright, bold, or endearing. That isn’t Shames’s style.
The Chi, Don Giovanni, has traits undesirable in a Chihuahua.
Fragile, frightened, and a veritable canine hypochondriac, he
spends most of his waking seconds quivering in the arms of Bert
the Shirt, an ex-Mafioso who’s his elderly owner. But the Shirt has
enough character for both of them, and his relationship with his
ancient dog makes for funny and heartwarming reading. Alive with
zany characters, packed with action, and set in colorful Key West,
Florida, Shames’s novels are among my favorites. Two of them,
Florida Straits (Dell) and Sunburn (Backinprint.com), feature Don
Giovanni on the cover.
Other Chihuahuas Associated 
with Celebrities
Many other Chis have mingled with the stars and deserve recogni-
tion, too:
 Pop singer Britney Spears had two Chihuahuas, Bit Bit and
Lucky, but she placed Lucky with an assistant after the dog
attacked the ankles of her then-husband, Kevin Federline.
 Actress Marilyn Monroe adopted a Chihuahua she named
Choo Choo in 1948.
Part V: The Part of Tens

The Midget of the AKC corral
The first Chihuahua registered with the American Kennel Club was a red-coated
Chi named Midget, owned by a Texan from El Paso. That was in 1904. The Chihuahua
Club of America was founded in 1923 and has thrived ever since. Mexico, however,
took longer to acknowledge its own breed. It didn’t register the Chihuahua breed
until 1942.

 Victorious Mexican General Santa Ana had his Chihuahuas
with him at the Alamo. In 1836, when he was finally captured,
several Chihuahuas were found in his camp.
 Actress Jayne Mansfield owned Chihuahuas; one of her dogs
died with her during a tragic car crash in 1967.
 Tennis great Martina Navratilova is a Chihuahua owner, and
so was former Yale football coach Herman Hickman. He had
two exceptionally small dogs named Killer and Slugger.
 Sharon Osbourne, wife of musician Ozzy Osbourne and reality
TV maven, has a Chihuahua named Martini.
 Other famous names linked with Chihuahuas include
Madonna, Rosie O’Donnell, Lupe Velez, Billie Holiday, Vincent
Price, Gertrude Stein, Mickey Rourke, Anne Heche, Christine
Ebersole, and Charo.
Finally, try visualizing California Governor (as of press time)
Arnold Schwarzenegger walking his Chihuahua. How about that for
attractive opposites!

MARY BLOOM
Every Chihuahua
should have her own
snug bed,complete
with a toy or two.
Chihuahuas love to 
be loved and are 
true companion 
dogs.They need
affection to thrive
and socialization to
cultivate their 
character.
© JEANMFOGLE.COM

The Chihuahua standard
describes the breed as
alert,with a saucy
expression and terrier-
like qualities.
© JEANMFOGLE.COM
Some long-coated
Chihuahuas have more
hair than others.This
one sports a thick coat.
What will these puppies
be like when they grow
up? They’ll probably be
a lot like their parents,
so ask to meet their
dam (mom) and any
other family members
the breeder has on the
premises.
MARY BLOOM

MARY BLOOM
This charmer’s eye-
catching coat comes from
good breeding,good 
nutrition,and good
grooming.
© JEANMFOGLE.COM
Although they are too
little to stop a thief,
Chihuahuas are alert
watch-dogs.If those
big ears detect a
stranger’s footsteps,
he’ll race to the door,
barking a warning.

A nice thing about Chihuahuas is that they take up so little room on the furniture.
It can take several weeks for puppy ears to become erect,and they don’t always do it at the same
time.Occasionally,the Chi’s ears refuse to stand even after the pup is grown.The result is a dog
that won’t win in the show ring but can still be a super pet.
MARY BLOOM
MARY BLOOM

Every Chi should know
how to walk on lead and
obey basic commands like
sit,down,and come.
This puppy is performing a friendship dance and should soon have a partner.
MARY BLOOM

Chihuahuas are the
ultimate housedog.
They can get enough
exercise indoors,but
will gladly join you in
any outside activity.
© JEANMFOGLE.COM
Even though Chis are
small in size,they can still
enjoy and excel on the
agility course.
© JEANMFOGLE.COM
Chihuahuas have 
well-rounded heads,
often referred to as
“apple domes.”

This Chi’s a party animal
ready to howl “Happy
Birthday!”
MARY BLOOM
Chihuahuas are very social animals.You can tell by his body language that this
smooth coat wants to play.
MARY BLOOM

Although Chis are
too tiny to associate
with toddlers,they
are content in the
arms of gentle
school-age children
(under supervision,
of course).
MARY BLOOM
Chihuahuas chill easily.A good
sweater will keep her warm on a
cold winter’s day.
