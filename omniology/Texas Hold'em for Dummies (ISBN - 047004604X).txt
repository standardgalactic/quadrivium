About the Author
Mark “The Red” Harlan was born in Rawlins, Wyoming, and has
lived exactly the life you’d expect as a result. Armed with a degree
in Applied Mathematics (from a university he loathes so much that
he refuses to even utter the name), he fell headlong into a 20-year
stint in the Silicon Valley’s computer industry.
Red’s professional experience includes human-interface work
at Apple Computer, development of the bidding schema used by
eBay, overseeing application development at Danger (makers of
the T-Mobile Sidekick), as well as co-founding CyberArts Licensing
(suppliers of the poker software seen on the MANSION and
GamesGrid sites).
At the tender age of 8, he won a pinewood derby competition in
the Cub Scouts, giving him his first heavy swig of victory that
would forever warp his oh-so-soft-and-pliable mind. Under the 
influence of this experience, he started playing poker that same
year (“might as well win money if you’re going to win”) and
became good enough by 2005 to be a net money winner in that
year’s World Series of Poker.
Red is a member of the American Society of Journalists and Authors
and has an extensive writing background ranging from penning
InfoWorld’s Notes from the Fringe during the heyday of the Internet,
to being lead author of the book he thinks everyone should own
(his mom does): Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies (Wiley).
Red maintains a Web site of poker articles at www.redsdeal.com
and welcomes non-spam e-mail at RedsDeal+HEFD@gmail.com
(be sure to include the +).


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my mom, Marijane, and my brother, 
J. Scott Harlan, mostly because you’re two saintly islands in a
world that could desperately use more of your type, and a little
because you’ve put up with me all these years.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Biggest thanks of this go ’round goes to Leslie “All Ska” Dill for pro-
viding the cheerleading, support, and total lack of advice that were
all precisely what I needed during the most stressful time of my life.
You know what you did. I’m glad you did it.
Super thanks to my agent Margot “The Sunny Negotiator” Hutchison,
for suggesting that I write this text, as well as driving through all my
crazy contract requirements.
Extra thanks to Elizabeth “Exclamation Points!” Kuball for acting
as my project editor and not freaking out when I say crazy things
in phone conversations.
A nod and a wink to Gridders: UCD Aces, ifoundnemo23, and
yanksalex. You guys are the reason I worked on poker sites for
a living, I just didn’t know it at the time.
Lingering but totally necessary thanks to: Josh “Birdhead” Carter
for continual computer expertise and extensive ideological support;
Taqueria Eduardo (TE) for having the greatest carnitas on the planet;
Max “You’re Not ‘Erik’” Francis for ongoing poker discussions,
loans of his poker library, and companionship at TE; Dino for not
selling Dino’s after all; Konstantin Othmer for repeated favors and
questions; Fishbone for not quitting; Chris Derossi for a zillionty
and one things; Radiohead for being the only band that matters;
and Clarus at the Bitmap Café.

Introduction
T
urn on the TV, drop by a news rack, spend ten minutes in any
college watering hole, or for that matter walk into your local
supermarket and you can see firsthand the stranglehold that Texas
Hold’em has on the public. Twenty years ago, when I’d play Hold’em
in a casino, it wasn’t unusual for people to stop and ask me about
the game. (I just have one of those ask-that-guy-he-looks-harmless
kind of looks, I guess.) Now my mom tells me about it.
Hold’em is a game that is deceptively simple: There are four
chances to bet (pre-flop, flop, turn, and river) and five ways you
can act when you do (check, bet, call, raise, or fold). Yet within
that simple mechanism, you’ll find truth and trickery, boredom and
fear, skill and misfortune — in other words, direct reflections of the
things that make life worth living.
Hold’em is a game of both skill and chance — and infuriatingly,
which of these things is the most important often changes without
warning. Needless to say, this interaction is what makes the game
gut wrenching at some times and great at others. If you want to
find a sucker, don’t hang out at a chess table. Then again, if you
can’t take being beaten by chance, it’ll be better for your blood
pressure if you spend your spare time knitting instead.
Amazingly, about 95 percent of the people who play Hold’em in a
professional card room (be it online or at a casino), lose money —
all because of the insidious nature of the rake (a small cut of every
pot the house takes). Don’t lose hope, though. Hold’em is a game
that can be beaten, and by buying this book and referring to it
often, you’re absolutely taking the right first step.
About This Book
This book is a grand overview of Texas Hold’em.
All Dummies books are designed as references. You don’t have to
read it from beginning to end, cover to cover. My advice is to treat
it like a salad bar: Load up on the things you’re most interested in,
and pass on the items that seem a bit too smelly.

In some of the later chapters, I make reference to concepts and
ideas I cover earlier, but the cross-referencing here is heavy. I
always point you back to the fundamental concepts for brush-ups.
Don’t stress out as you read these pages. You’re not expected to

Conventions Used in This Book
New terms are always written in italics, with a definition that fol-
lows close on its heels. If you’re a text skimmer and find yourself
running across a new word you don’t know, back up until you find
the italicized word (or just look in the glossary or index). You
might also see italics used for emphasis — and I can definitely get
emphatic from time to time.
Monofont is used for Web sites and e-mail addresses. There aren’t
a lot of site references in this book, and you certainly don’t need to
have access to a computer to learn or play poker, but there are
some very valuable references out in cyberspace that you need to
be aware of.
The sidebars you see in gray text are not required reading for the
book, but will usually relate to the text being discussed to illustrate
it more fully (or in some cases, it’s just me trying to make you
laugh). You’ll find a sidebar at the end of this Introduction.
What You’re Not to Read
Don’t worry about any of the paragraphs labeled with a Technical
Stuff icon. Those are present merely for completeness and to give
more illumination to the terminally hard core.
There are two chapters you should bypass at the start. Get a little
more general theory and practice under your belt before you
tackle them:
 Chapter 13: This one is all about the concept of game theory
and assumes you already understand the other poker con-
cepts that are in this book.
 Chapter 22: Get solid in the other topics in this book before
you go out and try to get even better. Remember: You need a
good foundation before you can build a fancy house.

Foolish Assumptions
I’ve made several assumptions about you as a reader — might as
well clear ’em up right here to avoid any future embarrassment.
I assume that
 You’re familiar with playing cards. You know that a deck has
52 cards, with 4 suits and 13 cards in each suit. You know
what a Jack, Queen, King, and Ace are.
 You would rather beat other people in poker than have
them beat you.
 You have any range of poker experience going from none
to a lot.
 You want to improve your game, no matter how good it is,
right now.
 Trying in vain to get a cocktail waitress’s attention is worse
than having one stop by your table when you don’t need her.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized this book in parts to make it more readily 
digestible. Yum.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas:
Welcome to Texas Hold’em!
Chapter 1 gives a synopsis of larger concepts you’ll run across in
the book: how the game is played, how to play the game, and
where the game is played.
The remainder of Part I talks about the hand rankings in poker,
how to read a hand, betting, blinds, and etiquette. It’s this section
that also talks about one of the most important facets of the game:
your bankroll.
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play
This section covers, in detail, the betting and play surrounding
your hole cards, the flop, the turn, and the river. It includes getting
hints as to whether you’re holding a winner or a loser and sub-
tleties like check-raising.

Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes:
Advanced Strategies of Hold’em
This is where things start getting really meaty. Knowing how to play
other players at the table, bluffing, and trapping are all covered here.
This part is also the one that deals with math (including pot odds)
and game theory.
If there’s one part you should really focus on in this book, it’s
this one.
Part IV: Casinos, Card Rooms, and
the Internet: Places to Play Hold’em
If you can play poker someplace, I talk about it here. This is also
the place where I fill you in on tournament play.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All great For Dummies books have a Part of Tens. In mine you find:
 A comparison between online and real-world play
 Common mistakes people make in Hold’em
 Great ways to make your home game better
 Bad beats (because everyone likes a good horror movie)
 Ways to get better
Glossary
Most For Dummies books don’t have a glossary (and neither do
lame poker books), but poker is so full of slang that I felt a glossary
was almost mandatory. New expressions in the text will always be
in italics followed by the definitions — the glossary wraps them all
together in a nice, tidy package.

Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little pictures in the margin that flag your attention
for a particular reason:
When you see this icon, you’ll find suggestions that save you time
or money. When you see the Tip icon, think “clever.”
Careful! These are things that if you ignore them could cost you
time or money.
When you see this icon, you’ll find information meant for the hard-
core poker player. If you see something with a Technical Stuff icon
that you don’t understand, don’t sweat it: You don’t need to know
it to improve your game.
Items flagged with this icon are things you’ll need to know either at
the poker table or later in the book.
While I highly advise against playing No-Limit ring games as a
beginner, you could run across a No-Limit tournament situation
when you’re just starting off. I mark No-Limit special cases with
this icon.
Where to Go from Here
Where you go is totally up to you. If you’ve never played Hold’em
or poker before, just carry on into Chapter 1. If you have played,
but you find yourself always losing, I suggest going to Chapter 8
and reading about the other players you’re up against. If you’ve
played a lot and just happened to pick up this book, either on a
whim or at a friend’s house, flip to Chapter 13.

My bankroll, this book, and you
Before I started writing this book, the last time I played Hold’em was in the 2005
World Series of Poker (money winner, thank you very much). I figured I should be
playing as I wrote, to keep the game more alive.
Playing only in tournaments, over the course of three months, and never playing in
tournaments where my entry fee was more than $33 (although some of my wins
were to satellites in bigger-entry-fee events), I have won:
 $3,596.85 in cash
 A $535 satellite seat for the World Series Main Event
 A $535 satellite seat for the World Series H.O.R.S.E. Event (Hold’em, Omaha,
Razz [7-Card Stud Low], 7-Card Stud, 7-Card Stud Eight or Better [high hand
splits with low hand])
I mention this not to brag (well, at least not too much), but to illustrate a point:
Because you play Hold’em against people, the game is beatable. I won this using
nothing more than years of practice combined with the exact concepts I put for-
ward in this book. 
If you practice and pay attention, you can — and will, over time — win.
Good luck to you.

T
wenty years ago, Texas Hold’em lived in relative poker obscu-
rity. When I was playing in casinos, it was fairly common for
people to come up and ask me about the game.
A few years ago, the perfect Hold’em storm was created: Chris
Moneymaker won the $10,000 Main Event of the World Series
(pocketing more than $2 million off of a $40 entry fee), the World
Poker Tour became the most successful program in the history of
the Travel Channel, and online play became prevalent.
The poker craze has gotten so out of hand that my mom is now
telling me about watching poker on TV: “It’s a lot like quilting. You
really have to pay attention to catch the nuances.” Not exactly the
way I look at the game, but the fact that she’s even watching says
something.
In this chapter, I give you an overview of everything else you
can expect from the book. Read on and then venture forth where
you will.
Oh yes, and good luck to you! Let’s shuffle up and deal.

Considering Why You Want to Play
Before you even cozy up to a card table, you should ask yourself a
critical question: Why am I here?
There are several possible answers to this question:
 I want to make money.
 I’m just out to chill with my pals and have a good time.
 I want to sharpen my game.
 Hold’em has just crossed into my mental radar and I want to
find out more about it.
 Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Your reason may even be a combination of these things. Whatever
your reason for being at the table, setting a main goal for your play
and trying to reach it is critically important.
What I’m about to say will sound like I’m joking, but I assure you
I’m not: You do not have to set a goal of making money at the table.
The media pressure, and general public attention on Hold’em, has
set up an expectation that you can, must, and should, win.
The sad fact is that roughly 95 percent of the people who play
poker in professional establishments lose money. It’s a devilishly
hard game to beat because of the rake (a small percentage of the
pot that the house takes to run the game — see Chapter 3 for
more), and because the vagaries of chance even out over time, you
have to truly maximize your wins and minimize your losses, or
you’ll watch your wallet slowly shrink.
It you decide from the outset that you have a goal other than win-
ning, you won’t beat yourself up when you don’t. And believe me,
no one at your table will argue with you if you don’t mind losing.
Don’t get me wrong, one of my requirements of sitting at a table is
that I play to win — when I don’t, it sets me in a foul mood for
hours if not days. Because you’re playing against other mortals —
people full of pride and fallibility — you can beat the game. My
friends and I have proven it over a mathematically significant
period of time.
But winning takes perseverance, attention, and thought. Your read-
ing this book is a great start. Keep going. Your will is already
stronger than the average Friday-night player — now’s the time to
get your ability up there as well.

Working with Game Dynamics
In order to begin appreciating the complexities of Hold’em, you
need to understand two basic elements of the game: your position
at the table, and the particular way the game is dealt.
The importance of position
When Hold’em is played in a professional card room (be it online or
in a brick-and-mortar casino), a dealer button acts as the theoretical
point that the cards are being dealt from. This button moves one
position clockwise around the table at the conclusion of every hand.
The player in the position immediately to the left of the dealer
(that is to say, clockwise) posts an automatic bet called the small
blind, and the player immediately to his left (or two places to the
left of the dealer) posts an automatic bet known as the big blind.
These are forced bets that players must make in order to get dealt
into the game. All other players get to see their hands “for free.”
(To get a better understanding of the dealer button and blinds, flip
to Chapter 3.)
Players decide whether to play or fold (quit) in a clockwise position,
starting with the player immediately to the left (clockwise) of the
big blind.
In Hold’em, your position relative to the other players is critical.
When you’re in the beginning of the betting order, your cards have
to be of higher quality than the cards you would normally play in
later position — especially if lots of players are left in the hand —
because you have no idea what evil may lurk beyond. (For more
detail on playing by position, see Chapter 4.)
Likewise, if you’re riding at the back of the calling order, you can
afford to play looser hands (those that aren’t as high quality) and
hope to catch cards to break people’s dreams. In fact, pot odds
(the amount you bet relative to the amount you would win) say
that sometimes you should call, even when you have a lesser hand.
(Chapter 12 gives you more detail on pot odds and all things
mathematical.)
Playing move by move
Like all poker games, Hold’em has a very specific order in which
the cards are dealt and played. (Chapter 2 has diagrams of Hold’em
Chapter 1: A Bird’s-Eye View of Texas Hold’em 11

hands being dealt if you want to see what they look like in action on
a table.)
Hole cards
At the start of a Hold’em hand, after the two blinds have been
posted, all players are dealt two cards facedown. These are known
as the hole or pocket cards. Players then make a decision to call
the blinds (match the big blind), raise the blinds (increase the bet)
or fold (quit playing and throw their cards away, facedown, to the
middle of the table — known as mucking).
In the form of Hold’em known as Limit, the bets have to be of a cer-
tain specified amount. In No-Limit, players may bet any amount of
their chips on the table. (You can find more on the different types
of betting limits and how they work in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4 (and
on the Cheat Sheet), you can find more on the types of hands you
should play as hole cards, according to your position, as well as
information on how to bet them.
If you’ve just been invited to a poker party and don’t have the time
to even read Chapter 4, here’s a general rule I tell newbies that
works remarkably well:
If both of your hole cards are not 10s or greater (Jacks, Queens,
Kings, or Aces), fold.
Yes, it sounds harsh, but it’ll keep you pretty much only playing the
cards that you should — and about the right frequency of hands.
Make sure not to show your hole cards to other players at the
table (even if those other players are no longer in the hand).
And after you’ve looked at your cards, you should protect them
from being collected by the dealer by placing an extra poker chip
(or some other small object) on top of them.
The flop
After the betting action is done on the round with the hole cards
(also known as pre-flop), three cards are displayed by the dealer
simultaneously to the center of the poker table — this is known as
the flop. At this point, each player at the table has a unique five-card
poker hand consisting of his two hole cards and the three commu-
nity cards.
Because of the raw number of cards involved, the flop typically
gives you the general tenor of the poker hand and definitely gives
you a good idea of the kind of hand to look for as a winner. For exam-
ple, an all-Spade flop (especially with a lot of players still in the
hand) will be hinting at a flush as a strong possibility for a winner.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
12

Betting begins with the first person still in the hand to the left
(clockwise) of the dealer button. As a general rule, you want
your hand to match the flop, and you should fold if it doesn’t.
(Chapter 5 is all about how to play the flop.)
In Limit play, the size of the bet you can make on the flop is identi-
cal to the amount you can make pre-flop.
The turn
After the flop betting round is completed, another community card
is placed, known as the turn (or sometimes fourth street). Each of
the remaining players now has a six-card poker hand made up of
his two private hole cards and the four community cards. Hold’em
is a game where only five cards count toward a poker hand, so
everyone has a theoretical “extra” card at this point.
In Limit, the betting is now twice the amount that was bet pre- and
post-flop.
Poker wags like to say, “The turn plays itself,” meaning your hand
gets better and you bet it, or it doesn’t and you start giving strong
thoughts to folding. This is more or less true. (You can find more
details about playing the turn in Chapter 6.)
The river
After the betting round of the turn, a final community card is
exposed, known as the river (sometimes called fifth street).
Each player left in the game has his final hand consisting of the
best five cards of the seven available (two private hole cards and
the five community cards). Players may use two hole cards along
with three community cards, one hole card combined with four
community cards, or just the five community cards (known as 
playing the board). Again, poker hands are made up of the best five
cards — the other two available to any given player don’t count.
There is one final round of betting. (Chapter 7 washes you with the
river details.)
The showdown
The showdown is what happens after the final river bets have been
placed. Although it isn’t formally required, typically the person who
initiated the final round of betting is first to show her hand. The
action then proceeds in a clockwise fashion with players either
mucking their hands if they can’t beat the hand exposed, or show-
ing a better hand (at which point the dealer mucks the old, “worse”
hand and continues around the table for any remaining hands).
Chapter 1: A Bird’s-Eye View of Texas Hold’em 13

Winners and losers are determined by the standard poker hand
rankings. (Chapter 2 gives more details on those if you’re not
already familiar with them.)
If you’re ever unclear about who is winning a hand, just turn your
cards face up and let the dealer decide. Never take a player’s word
on what she has in hand until you’ve actually seen her cards with
your own eyes — when you muck a hand, it’s officially dead.
Moving Up a Notch
After you have the basics of how the game is played, it’s time to
move into the deeper levels of the game.
Gleaning your opponents
By far, the most important thing in a poker game is figuring out,
and then playing specifically to, your opponents. When you’ve
been bet into, what might be a raise against one player can be an
easy and fast fold against another.
You need to factor in such questions as:
 How likely is your opponent to bluff?
 Does your opponent sense weakness in your betting action or
in the way you’re behaving at the table?
 Is your opponent’s table position influencing the way he
plays?
 Do the board cards hint at a good hand (or possibly a hand
that has been “missed,” and is your opponent now bluffing)?
If you read no other chapter of this book, look over Chapter 8 for
much more detail on playing the players at the table.
Playing the roles
When it’s your turn to bet, you really only have some subset of five
choices:
 Check: If no one else has bet yet
 Bet: If no one else has bet
 Call: If a player in front of you has bet and you want to match
the amount to stay in the game
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
14

 Raise: If a player in front of you has bet, but you want to
increase the amount
 Fold: If you’ve decided you can’t take it any more
With such limited choices, some people may think there isn’t a
whole lot to the game — but nothing could be farther from the truth.
Bluffing
One of the things poker is best known for is bluffing (acting as
though you have a hand that you don’t actually have, in an effort to
get your opponent to fold). Bluffing is the point where your the psy-
chological rubber hits the steely money road — and it’s the glorious
difference that separates poker from nearly any other game you can
mention.
Bluffing works best when:
 You’re playing against a weaker opponent (who is likely to fold).
 There is a large amount of money at stake, where winning
the hand would make a difference to your stack.
 People have reason to believe you aren’t bluffing.
 The community cards hint at a hand you could have (for
example, a straight or a flush) but that you actually don’t.
Bluffing is a bad idea when:
 You try to get a player to fold who is very prone to calling,
“just to see what you have.”
 There is no other obvious reason for you to bluff.
 You’re playing with people who think, “Sure, I’ll call — that
guy always bluffs.”
 You gain nothing (or nearly nothing) by doing so.
For more on bluffing, see Chapter 9.
Slow playing
Slow playing is the expression used to describe a player who has
an extremely good hand, but doesn’t bet it strong from the start, all
in an effort to squeeze more money out of his opponent.
The good news is, if you slow-play it can help camouflage your
hand, leaving the unsuspecting at your disposal. The bad news is
it can backfire and give your opponent a chance to draw cards that
can ultimately beat you.
Chapter 1: A Bird’s-Eye View of Texas Hold’em 15

Chapter 10 is your slow-playing headquarters. In the name of indi-
rection, it’s best to act like you’re actually going somewhere else as
you mosey on over to Chapter 10 and take a look.
Figuring in math
If playing your opponents is the most important thing to know at a
poker table, the next most important is mathematics.
The math behind poker isn’t complicated — much of it you can
already do off the top of your head, assuming you know little
things like the fact that a deck has 52 cards: 4 suits, each with 13
ranked cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace).
What you can’t (or don’t want to) figure out you can memorize.
The two important things to pay attention to are the chances of
making your hand on a draw (for example, you have four Clubs
between your hand and the community cards through the turn —
what’re the chances of seeing one on the river?), and what are the
pot odds if you do (that is, how much do you win relative to how
much you bet?).
I cover mathematics in detail in Chapter 12 — and I promise it’s
not the yawner that it was in school.
Places You Can Play
Playing poker is easy, assuming you can find a game. Of course,
thanks to the current poker craze, you can find a game nearly
anywhere.
Home games
For poker, there’s truly no place like home. For one thing, there’s
no rake. For another, you can slap on your Judas Priest album and
bang your head — and your tablemates can just join in.
The upsides:
 You get to play with your pals. (This is an upside only if you
actually like your pals.)
 You get to play as naked as you’d like.
 You call the shots on everything.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
16

The downsides:
 Your dog might eat the food you spread out on the counter.
 The equipment isn’t as nice as a professional card room.
 Your place tends to get a little bit trashed.
For more on home games, take a look at Chapter 14. Chapter 20
has some ideas on making your home games better.
Casinos and poker rooms
As far as a place to play goes, you can’t beat the equipment, 
comfort, and cocktail waitresses of a professional card room.
A professional dealer lets you focus all your attention on the game
(and not having to fumble with the cards yourself), and gaming
commission rules ensure that you’re getting a fair deal.
When you go to a professional card room, you should check in
with the board person (the person responsible for the waiting lists)
to find out the limits and games that are being spread. The floor-
person will seat you and help you get your chips.
Chapter 16 has the rundown on professional card rooms, and hey,
don’t forget to tip your dealer!
Online
The biggest poker room in the world is no farther away than your
computer. All you need to do is transfer money from your bank
account to a third-party transfer agent, and then from there to the
poker site of your choice. (This is a process similar to using PayPal
for buying stuff off of eBay.)
As soon as you have money in your account, you can be off and
playing. The good news is, the rakes tend to be less and there are
more bonuses than at brick-and-mortar card rooms. The bad news
is, the physical absence of a player at your table makes reading
tells much harder.
See Chapter 15 for more on the online world. Chapter 18 details
some differences between the online and “real” worlds. And hey,
if you really get into playing online, you can just pick up a copy
of Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies (published by Wiley),
which I wrote with Chris Derossi. It dovetails almost perfectly with
this book.

 Scoring a pot
T
he main thing to remember about Hold’em is that it’s still just
poker. If you already know poker’s hand rankings, you’re already
all over what beats what in Hold’em.
If you’ve played poker but not Hold’em, skip ahead to the “Reading
a Hand” section of this chapter. There you get a feel for how to tell
the value of a hand as well as the board.
Hand Rankings
When a Hold’em hand is fully dealt, you have ownership of seven
cards — your two hole cards, along with the five community cards.
Your poker hand is the best five cards of the seven. The other two
cards don’t count toward the hand in any way.
Figure 2-1 illustrates the way hands are ranked. Hold’em uses
exactly the same hand rankings as all other standard poker games,
and — assuming you’re not playing at Crazy Larry’s — there aren’t
any wild cards.
In the following sections, I walk through these hand rankings from
lowest to highest. At a card table, whenever you get one of these
hands for the very first time in your life, be sure to squeal with
glee. It doesn’t make your hand any better, but it’s good entertain-
ment for everyone else at an otherwise monotonous table.

High card only — no pairs
The technical name for this hand is “bad.” It’s any hand were you
have, in a word, nothing. If the board shows 10 5 4 3 K
and you hold A Q, your hand is A-K-Q-10-5. Rank order of the
unrelated cards determines the winner (Aces are high). So this hand
beats A-K-Q-10-4 (all other cards tie, and 5 beats 4) but would lose to
A-K-Q-J-4 (first three cards tie, but J beats 10).
One pair
This hand is two cards of the same rank with three unrelated
cards. If two players hold the same pair, then the unrelated cards
are compared to determine a winner.
Two pair
In this hand, you have two cards of the same rank along with two
cards of another rank and an unrelated card. If multiple players
have two pair, the high single pair of all the two-pair hands wins. If
players have identical high pairs, the highest ranked second pair
wins (K-K-Q-Q-4 beats K-K-7-7-A). If multiple players have identical
two-pair hands, the person with the highest unrelated card (the
kicker) wins (3-3-2-2-K beats 3-3-2-2-9).
Three-of-a-kind
This hand is three of one rank matched with two unrelated cards.
Three-of-a-kind is also called a set or trips.
Straight
Five cards, not of the same suit, ranked in sequence are considered
a straight. A-K-Q-J-10 (known in poker slang as Broadway) is the
highest straight. A-2-3-4-5 is the lowest (called a wheel). Straights
are always called by their high card, for example “7-high-straight.”
The highest ranked straight wins.
The wheel is the only case in Hold’em where the Ace is low. An 
A-2-3-4-5 straight is only 5-high, not Ace-high.
Straights are not allowed to wrap around. Q-K-A-2-3 is not a
straight — it’s a hand that is Ace-King-high.
Chapter 2: Ranking and Reading a Hand 21

Flush
In this hand, you have five non-straight cards of the same suit. 2
3 5 8 10 is a “10-high flush.” The highest ranked flush wins.
All suits have the same value. One suit is not worth more than any
other (unlike a game like bridge where spades outrank hearts).
Full house
This is three-of-a-kind matched with a pair. A full house (also called a
full boat or just simply boat) is always ranked and called by the
three-of-a-kind rank first, so 5-5-5-Q-Q is called, “fives full of Queens.”
Four-of-a-kind
As you can probably guess, this hand is four cards of one rank
(also known as quads) with another loner. If two players have the
same four-of-a-kind, the highest fifth card determines the hand.
Straight flush
This is five cards that are both straight and flush. Q J 10 9
8 is a “Queen-high straight flush.” A straight flush wheel (a steel
wheel) is the lowest straight flush.
Royal flush
A-K-Q-J-10 of the same suit is called a royal flush, but really, it’s just
a fancy name for the highest possible straight flush.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em

How rare is a royal flush?
Assuming all seven cards get dealt out and you get to choose the five best (which
is the way a full Hold’em hand is dealt), on average you’ll see one royal flush every
30,940 hands. A royal flush on the board (meaning the five up cards in the middle of
the table only) will happen only once every 649,740 hands. Better start playin’.

Reading a Hand
If you’ve never played Hold’em, you’ll find that getting used to how
to read a hand takes a while. Don’t panic, just pick the best five
cards of the seven.
Straightforward hands
Some hands are pretty obvious. For example in Figure 2-2, Dean
has a pair of Aces, Jerry has a pair of Kings. The pair of Aces win.
Figure 2-2: A pair of Aces beat a pair of Kings.
Figure 2-3 shows two players with a straight. David has the high
end with 10-9, Tina has the bottom end with 5-4. David wins, Tina
complains. A lot.
Figure 2-3: 10-high straight beats 8-high straight.
Chapter 2: Ranking and Reading a Hand 23

Figure 2-4 is an example of two people playing the board. Although
Gilligan managed to get a pair of Jacks early on, and Ginger also
ended up with an Ace-high straight, the highest hand, for both
players, is the flush on the board.
Figure 2-4: Both players have a Queen-high flush.
Subtle hands
These hands are the ones that have the ability to jump out and bite
you if you’re not careful.
Take a look at Figure 2-5. The river card is key here. It made
Virginia’s set of Queens, completed Robert’s King-high straight,
but made Scott’s Queen-high flush.
Figure 2-5: Scott wins with a Queen-high flush.

Consider Figure 2-6 carefully and see if you can figure out what
each player has before reading ahead.
Figure 2-6: Which hand is best?
John had two pair — Aces and Queens — with a 10 kicker. This
hand is the best starting hand of the three players, although it
never improved. Teddy had a King-high straight on fourth street
with the hand improving to flush in the river. Jackie, though, is
the big winner with a full house, twos full of Queens.
Counterfeiting
I’ve played poker more than 30 years, and after all this time, coun-
terfeiting is the one thing about the game that has the ability to
drive me insane. Counterfeiting is what happens when a card, or
series of cards, hits the board that somehow spoils your hand, or
takes away from its inherent value.
For example if you were dealt pocket Aces, and the board eventu-
ally showed 2-3-4-5-6, your A-2-3-4-5 straight was counterfeited by
a 6-high-straight on the board.
More diabolical versions of counterfeiting exist, though. Figure 2-7
shows an actual tournament hand I was in.
Figure 2-7 shows the final hand of a charity tournament, one card
away from the finish. The winner would take home a money prize;
the other two would get all-you-can-eat servings of crow in extra-
large doggie bags. Because I knew both players were going to be
involved in the hand, and we were right on the money cutoff, I
was “forced” to play if I wanted a taste of the prizes (more on

tournament dynamics in Chapter 17). All players had bet all their
chips at this point, and the cards were exposed.
Figure 2-7: A board ready for Red’s counterfeit river card.
The diagram is frozen in time at the turn. Silent Bob is holding two
pair, Jacks and 7s and being real quiet about it (only because he’s
losing badly and only one of two 7s left in the deck will save him).
Big Tuffy is going wild, thinking he’s essentially locked the game as
long as an Ace doesn’t hit on the river.
Examine the hand and consider this: I win this hand (yay!), but I do
not draw an Ace on the river. How do I win? How can I win?
The river card, Q, hits the board. Big Tuffy’s friends went wild.
They thought he had won the hand, and in fact the dealer began
pushing the monster pot in his direction. I stopped her and
explained the board. Forget what I said then — the short version is
Big Tuffy had been counterfeited.
The river Queen gives Silent Bob two pair, and the lowest hand of
the three players — Queens and Jacks with a 7 kicker. It gives Big
Tuffy the same two pair, but a better hand with Queens and Jacks
and a 9 kicker. Your hero (that would be me), however, was handed
Queens and Jacks with an Ace kicker to win!
After some soul searching, and a deeper understanding of just
exactly what the phrase “best hand wins” means, Big Tuffy and his
pals turned a whiter shade of pale about the same time as my bank
account turned a deeper shade of green. (For information on how
to corral dealers as they start walking off into the weeds, as hap-
pened here, have a peek at Chapter 3.) Hey, I said that counterfeit-
ing drives me insane; I didn’t say that it stops me from playing.

Paying a Hand
The only way to win is to get, as Beck says, “real paid.” Paying a
hand is fairly straightforward, although you need to be aware of
some subtle nuances.
The winner
Best hand gets the spoils. If you’re playing in a game with folks who
are overly dramatic, awarding the loser(s) of any given hand a tissue
is not a bad idea.
Chapter 2: Ranking and Reading a Hand 27
Looking for Mr. Big
A very good trick to figure out early on is to take a deck of cards and practice read-
ing boards. Deal a few sets of hole cards face up to imaginary players and deal five
board cards face up in the middle. Take a long look at every hand to determine what
the different players have relative to the board and figure out the winner.
Just as useful is to look at the board cards and get a feel for what the best possi-
ble hands are in order to get a better idea of what can happen on a board.
For example, let’s take a board of A A K 10 9. The best possible hand (the
nuts) here is four Aces (A-A along with the board).
The next best are the full houses. The best is A-K for Aces full of Kings. If you held
this hand, you would have the best hand, because you know it’s impossible for
anyone to have quad Aces (you hold one), and you hold the nut full house.
From there, the full houses rate A-10, A-9. These are followed by pocket pairs K-K
(gives Kings full of Aces), 10-10, and 9-9.
There are no flush possibilities (you have to have three board cards of the same
suit), so that’s out, but there is one straight, Broadway, if someone is holding a Q-J.
Below that are the trip Aces (A along with any card that does not match the board).
From there are the two pair. You don’t really have to dig deeper than this, if for no
other reason than it’s not the low hands that beat you — it’s the high hands.
Probably the biggest difference between a true novice (someone just learning how
the game is played) and a beginner (someone who is actually playing) is having a
feel for just how good your hand is relative to the board being displayed. Getting a
feel for this is much easier if you have an idea of all the hands possible on any given
board layout.

Normal situations
A “normal situation” (my term, not some crazy poker slang) is the
case where all players in the pot have enough money to cover all
the necessary bets being made. In this situation, which is by far
the most typical, the best hand gets awarded the pot.
If you happen to win the pot (and honestly, after you read this
book, how could you not?) and you’re playing in a professional
poker room, you should not reach out and scoop the pot toward
yourself until the dealer has made the motion (for more on table
etiquette, see Chapter 3). Doing so is considered bad form, and
repeated abuse will get you thrown out of an establishment.
All-in
If a player wants to make a bet with all the money he has remaining
on the table (be it an initial bet, call, or raise), he moves his money
to the center and declares, “All-in.” When a player has made this
declaration, he is playing only for bets matching his original amount
in the main pot — any remaining money goes into a side pot.
After the river card is dealt, and all final bets have been made,
players playing for the side pot expose their hands first. Best hand
is awarded the side pot.
This winning hand of the side pot is then compared to the all-in
player for the main pot. The best hand of the two wins the main.
For example, say there’s a game with Uncle Poison and Aunt Sally
(both with $15), and Dorothy (with $1). Poison bets $5 and Sally
calls. Dorothy wants to play in the hand and she calls all-in. The
dealer will make two pots. The main pot has $3 ($1 from each of
the players, including Dorothy’s $1 all-in), and the side pot has $8
($4 each from Poison and Sally — the amount left over after match-
ing Dorothy’s bet).
At the showdown at the end of the hand, the dealer first has Poison
and Sally show their hands for the side pot. For illustration, I’ll say
Poison has two pair, beating Sally’s pair. He wins the $8 side pot.
Sally’s hand is then mucked and Poison’s hand is left exposed on
the table. The dealer then has Dorothy show her hand. Dorothy
has a full house, beating Poison’s two pair and she wins the $3
main pot. Toto does a flip to celebrate.
There can be as many side pots as necessary to cover all players,
although you rarely see more than two on any single hand, even at
a full table.

Tie hands
Tie hands are more common in Hold’em than most other forms of
poker because all the players at the table are sharing five commu-
nity cards. In the event of a tie, the pot is split evenly between all
players still in the hand.
All players must have five identically ranked cards to tie, and the
sixth and seventh card do not count. A A 2 2 K and A
A 2 2 K are tie hands. A K 4 3 2 and A Q J
10 9 are not. (The Ace-King flush is better than the Ace-Queen
flush.)
If the pot can’t be perfectly split and there’s a leftover chip (say
$51 where the smallest chip is $1) the pot is split as evenly as
possible ($25 to each player) and the extra chip ($1), goes to the
player “closest to the dealer button,” meaning the first person to
act among the winners. Having to act first is a disadvantage (see
Chapter 1 for why), so this person is given the reward.

T
he first time you see Texas Hold’em played, it can feel a little
bit like the inside joke that only you don’t get. Don’t sweat it,
though. Hold’em is an easy game to understand.
What’s not as obvious is how much money you should take to the
table, as well as the social standards of playing. I cover it all in this
chapter.
The Order of Play
As with all forms of poker, in Hold’em, cards are dealt clockwise
from the dealer. All players are then subjected to a round of betting
(see Chapter 1). Any players who fold are no longer eligible for the
pot and are skipped over in subsequent betting rounds for that
specific hand.

The Dealer Button
If you’re used to playing poker at your kitchen table, you’re proba-
bly familiar with rotating the deal from player to player at the end
of every hand.
In a professional card room, the house employee that deals the
cards isn’t actually involved in the hand. That casino employee
(also, a little confusingly, called the dealer) merely acts as a 
sometimes-wise-cracking card-distribution and pot-collection/
distribution mechanism. The house doesn’t have a vested
interest in the hand; instead, it makes its money through the
rake (a percentage of every pot — see the nearby sidebar,
“The insidious rake”).
When cards are dealt, the house acts as though there is a virtual
dealer at the table, using a small round white marker with a D on it
(for dealer) to signify the chosen dealer of the moment. Cards are
dealt around the table in an order as though they’re coming from
the dealer marker, and all betting action starts immediately clock-
wise from that position.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
32
The insidious rake
Professional card rooms don’t have a vested interest in the game — they only pro-
vide the tables, cards, and dealers for play. But they do take what’s known as the
rake, a percentage of every pot that is won. The rake typically is 5 to 10 percent of
the pot, with a maximum amount taken capped at $3.
On the surface, the rake seems like a pretty good deal. A loser is watching his money
go away anyway, so it doesn’t matter where it goes. And when a winner gets pushed
a $97 pot rather than $100, it’s not like she’s going to complain.
The problem is that the rake eats at everyone over time. If ten people sit at a table
for an hour with $100 each and 30 hands are dealt (not an unrealistic number) with
a $3 rake each, at the end of an hour, $90 is gone. The equivalent of one player has
been busted out just from the acidic corrosion of the rake.
Looking at it another way, imagine flipping a coin with someone where every time
they won you paid them a dollar, but every time you won, they only paid you 95 cents.
That’s what’s happening at a table with rake.
The only way to dodge the rake is to play in something like a home game that doesn’t
have it. Otherwise, you’re under constant bankroll threat.

Moving the dealer button around the table ensures that all people
get to play all positions throughout a long session of cards. (See
Chapter 1 for more on why this is a big deal — pardon the pun.)
Dealing the Cards
The order in which Hold’em is dealt is very specific and, assuming
you’re playing with a table full of lucid, honest people, never
changes.
The hole cards
Starting with the player clockwise from the dealer button, all play-
ers are dealt two hole cards, one at a time, in a clockwise fashion.
You are allowed to look at your hole cards (in fact you should —
unless your psychic powers are way, way up there, it would be
hard to know exactly what kind of hand you had if you didn’t).
However, for the most part you should not show these cards to
other players, even when folding — more on that in the “Poker
Etiquette” section, later in this chapter.
Be very careful to not expose your hole cards to other players as
you peek at them. You’re allowed to use both of your hands to look
at your cards (although you’re not allowed to take your cards off
the edge of the table) and should do so to help keep them shielded
from prying eyes. Always memorize your cards when you look at
them, including the suit — this will keep you from having to refer
to them again when something like a flush or straight draw hits the
board (if you do, it’ll be obvious that you’re looking to see if you
hit your straight or flush draw).
When you’re dealt your hole cards, it’s not a bad idea to wait and
not look at either of them until it’s your turn to act. This way you
can watch other players around the table as they glimpse at their
cards for possible hints as to what they may have (see Chapter 8
for more on tells). This strategy also keeps you from being obvious
about whether you’re going to bet or fold well before it’s your turn
to act.
If you do decide to wait to look at your hole cards, nearly every
player at the table will be looking at you as you glimpse your cards.
Have your best poker face ready. (If you don’t have the ability to
generate a good poker face, sneak a peek at each of your cards, one
at a time as they are dealt — or you could wear a Halloween mask,
I guess.)
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 33

The flop
After a round of betting for the hole cards (see “Betting” later in
this chapter), a card is burned off the top of the deck (meaning dis-
carded without being looked at — this is done in case the top card
had somehow been exposed or marked), and three cards are dealt
faceup to the center of the table. This is known as the flop and is
the start of the community cards on the table — those cards that
everyone may incorporate in his hand.
Everyone who has not folded now has a five-card hand — two hole
cards combined with the three community cards. A round of bet-
ting takes place.
The turn
After the flop betting round, another card is burned from the deck
and a fourth community card is exposed. This card is known as the
turn (sometimes fourth street).
All players still in the hand now have six cards to choose from to
make their best five-card poker hands. There is another round of
betting and one more card yet to be exposed.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
34
Protecting your hand
When playing in a casino environment, protecting your cards is essential. This
means you should always have control of your hole cards either by keeping your
hands on them (not a great choice, because forgetting and letting them go is too
easy), or by placing something on top of your cards as they lie at rest on the table.
The protector you use can range from just an extra poker chip in your stack, to your car
keys, or maybe even your niece whom you were supposed to baby-sit for the day (if you
can get her to sit still). Greg Raymer, winner of the 2004 World Series main event, uses
fossils. I use a Polish zloty (a coin) because it can never be mistaken for anything else.
If you don’t protect your hand, and it’s hit by cards being mucked (discarded) by other
players, your hand is automatically folded. Another possibility is that the dealer
assumes you have folded and just mucks the hand herself. (The underlying theory here
is that you can prove what hand you had out of the mess of cards sitting in front of you.)
Get in the habit of dropping a chip on top of your facedown cards at the table. When
you fold, pass your hole cards facedown to the dealer, and leave whatever you’re
using as a “protector” in front of you.

The river
A card is burned and the most infamous of community cards, the
river (sometimes called fifth street) is dealt. All remaining players
have seven cards for selecting their best five-card poker hand
(their two hole cards combined with the five community cards).
A round of betting takes place, and the best five-card hand at the
table is the winner.
To determine their five-card hand, players may use zero, one, or
both of their hole cards in combination with five, four, or three
community cards, respectively.
Because a player is required to use at least three community cards
to make a hand, there can be no flushes if there are not three cards
of the same suit (multiple suits with no flush possibilities based on
the current exposed community cards is known as a rainbow). Nor
can there be a straight if there aren’t three cards from a five-card
sequence (for example, 5-8-9).
In Figure 3-1, George is playing the board and has a King-high heart
flush. John is using one hole card for an Ace-high flush, but Ringo
is the big winner using both hole cards for a straight flush.
Figure 3-1: Each player using a different number of hole cards 
to determine a hand.
The showdown
If everyone in a hand has folded, leaving a single player, that
person wins the pot by default and is not required to show his
hand to any player at the table in any way.

Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 35

If more than one player at the table is still in a hand, and the final
betting round has ended, the game has entered a phase known as
the showdown (the part where people expose their cards to see
who has won).
Anyone still in the hand may turn over his cards at this point, but
people are usually reluctant to do so. If no one is making a motion
to show his hand, the last person to raise (or the first person to
bet if there were no raises on the river) in the final round of betting
exposes his hand first — the theory being that this is the hand that
everyone else called. (If no one bet on the river, the player closest
to the dealer has to expose his hand first.)
Players are welcome, if not encouraged, to muck a losing hand with-
out showing it. However, after a hand has been mucked (meaning
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
36
Getting a peek at another person’s cards
There is a little-known, but occasionally useful, tool at your disposal when playing in
a Hold’em game. If a player has gone all the way to the river and then lost on the show-
down, you can ask to see that player’s hand, even if he’s planning on mucking it.
To see it, make it clear to the dealer as early as you can that you want to see the
hand (or all hands) in question. Even if the losing player mucks the hand, the dealer
will isolate the two hole cards in question, tap them against the other cards in the
muck (this demonstrates to security and floor personnel that the hand is dead) and
expose the cards to the table.
The rules vary. At some houses, you have to have been in on the hand at the show-
down to request a look. At others, you merely have to have been dealt into that hand
(you’re not allowed to ask to see a hand if you’re merely observing).
There is a small catch to be aware of: If you’ve been declared the winner of a hand
and you ask to see another player’s hand, that hand is still live when it’s exposed. In
theory, if a player had mucked a hand that beat yours, and you asked to see it, you
would lose the pot. Dealers tend to make a big deal about it, but in my years of play
I have never seen this happen.
Don’t be surprised to get standoffish reactions from people at the table if you ask
to see the hand. For reasons that have never been clear to me, this request is a
mildly unpopular one.
In online games, this request is much easier. At nearly all sites, when you request
a hand history, you’ll be shown the cards of all players from the showdown. (See
Chapter 15 for more about online play.)

turned facedown and pushed into the discards beyond the player’s
control), the hand is considered dead and no longer in competition
for the pot.
After the first hand is exposed, remaining players expose their
hands in a clockwise order. The dealer will muck losing hands one
by one, leaving only the winning hand exposed for the awarding of
the pot. When the dealer has determined a winner, she will push
the pot in the direction of the player, and at that point, the winner
is welcome to drag the pot in.
Don’t ever trust another player when he announces a hand at the
end of a showdown and muck your hand based on that informa-
tion. After you’ve mucked your hand, it is truly dead and you can
never bring it back. If there is an error on a player’s call, other
players may lie to you as a “joke.” It’s even more likely that they’ll
misread a hand. (I bet I’ve seen people read a combined hand of
four spades and three clubs as a “flush” a hundred times in my
life.) If you have any question as to who won a hand when you’re
involved in a showdown, merely turn your hand over and let the
dealer make the decision.
Posting Blinds
In order to start betting in Hold’em, forced bets (known as blinds)
are made by the two players immediately clockwise from the
dealer button. The person immediately clockwise from the dealer
has the small blind, and the next player clockwise has the big blind.
Making blind bets is known as posting and this is done before any
cards are dealt.
The size of the bets are determined by the limits of the game that
you’re playing and the small blind is nearly always half of the big
blind (for more, see “Betting,” later in this chapter). So a $2/$4
Limit Hold’em game has a small blind of $1 and a big blind of $2.
Blinds are forced bets. The players in these positions must make
these bets or they aren’t dealt cards in the hand. These blinds, in
turn, force betting action on the table after everyone has been
dealt their hole cards.
Figure 3-2 shows a $2/$4 Limit Hold’em game. The hole cards have
just been dealt, with Groucho as the dealer, Zeppo the small blind,
and Chico the big blind. Harpo is the first to act and must now
either call the $2 big blind bet, raise to $4, or fold (turn to “Limit
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 37

Hold’em,” later in this chapter, for a description on Limit betting).
Checking is not an option for Harpo, because the big blind counts
as a bet. Harpo’s position of being first to act is known as being
under the gun. Honk-honk.

Fine points of posting first blinds
When you first sit down at a Hold’em table, the rules vary as to whether you have
to post blinds (even if you’re out of the normal blind positions for that hand) in order
to be dealt a hand.
In Las Vegas, you’re dealt a hand as soon as you sit down and have shown that you
meet the table’s minimum buy-in. You’re not required to post a blind in order to get
hole cards.
Conversely, in most California card rooms, you’re required to post a big blind in order
to get your starting hand.
In cases where you’re required to post a big blind before you’re dealt cards, you’re
mildly better off just waiting until it would normally be your turn to get the big blind
anyway, rather than jumping straight into the hand. Waiting like this keeps you from
making an extra forced bet and gives an added bonus of being able to case the play-
ers at the table while you aren’t actually playing. Dealers are used to this behavior
and will probably ask you if you want to sit out (that is, wait until it’s your turn to post
the big blind).
How soon you post is a fine point, though, that doesn’t really make that much differ-
ence. If you’re itchin’ to play, or if you’ve got a very limited amount of time to play, go
ahead and jump in. The dealer will tell you whether you’re required to post a big blind.

Betting
A bet is when a player makes a wager on a poker hand. In Hold’em,
there are four betting rounds (times when players make betting
action around the table). These rounds always come after players
seeing cards: after the hole cards are dealt, after the flop, after the
turn, and after the river.
When it’s a player’s turn to act (meaning it’s his turn to bet), the
player has a few choices. If no bets have previously been made in
the round, he may:
 Check: That is, choose not to bet at the moment but still be in
the hand.
 Bet: Make a bet on the hand.
If someone has already made a bet when it’s a player’s turn to act
in a round, the player may:
 Fold: Muck his hand and lose any chance at winning the pot.
 Call: Match the bet that has been made previously. He still has
full rights to winning the pot.
 Raise: Match the bet that was made previously and then add
more (being careful not to string raise — see the “Poker
Etiquette” section of this chapter for more). Everyone left at
the table must call the size of this raise or fold.
A betting round ends when all players have put the same amount
of money into the pot (with the exception of all-in, described in
Chapter 2) and all players have had an opportunity to act.
The amount and the style in which you can bet in Hold’em are
determined before the game has started. The betting types are
known as Spread-Limit, Limit, Pot-Limit, and No-Limit.
Spread-Limit Hold’em
In Spread-Limit games, you’re allowed to bet any amount, within a
given range, during a betting round. So in a $1 to $5 game you’re
allowed to bet $1, $2, $3, $4, or $5.
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 39

About the only place you find Spread-Limit Hold’em is playing at
other people’s kitchen-table home games. Professional card houses
dealing a Spread-Limit game are very rare, indeed, tending to
happen only in places sitting in poker backwaters (Blackhawk,
Colorado, for example).
Typically in Spread-Limit, your raise must be at least equal in size
to the bet in front of you. If someone bets $3 in a $1 to $5 game,
and you want to raise, you can raise by $3, $4, or $5 only. Don’t be
afraid to ask a dealer what the betting rules are if you come across
a Spread-Limit game.
Usually, the minimum buy-in (the amount you need to start playing
the game) in a Spread-Limit game is ten times the lowest betting
amount — so $10 in a $1 to $5 game. There is no maximum.
Limit Hold’em
When you run into a Hold’em ring game (that is, a game where
people are playing for money on the table, as opposed to a tourna-
ment with a prize structure) in a professional card room, the most
common game you’ll find (especially in the lower betting ranges) is
the form known as Limit. In Limit, assuming you don’t check, you
must bet exactly the amounts prescribed by the game in each
round — no more and no less.
Limit is always described by two numbers: The biggest is twice the
size of the smallest — for example, $10/$20 (said, “ten-twenty” with
the $ ignored). The smaller of the two numbers is the exact amount
players must bet (or raise) after seeing their hole cards and the
flop. This means the smaller number is also the size of the big
blind (because that is the forced first bet in Hold’em) and the small
blind is half that amount ($5 in a $10/$20 Limit game). The larger
number is what must be bet (or raised) on the turn and the river.
In casinos and card rooms, Limit games typically start at $2/$4 and
run up into the hundreds of dollars (see Chapter 16 for more on
professional card rooms). Online games can get extreme in the
other direction and be as small as $0.05/$0.10 (Chapter 15 talks
about online games).
Limit typically has a minimum buy-in of ten times the smaller bet
size. So a $2/$4 game requires a buy-in of at least $20. There is no
maximum.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
40

Limit tends to be the hardest variation of poker to bluff (bet as
though you have a good hand when you actually do not in an effort
to get others to fold) because the bet sizes are regulated. (See
Chapter 9 for more on bluffing.)
Pot-Limit Hold’em
Pot-Limit is the rarest form of Hold’em played today. I’m listing it
just to be complete-ist, but don’t sweat the details — you’ll proba-
bly play a lot of Hold’em before you run across a Pot-Limit game.
Like Limit, Pot-Limit is always listed as two dollar figures, say
$1/$2. You’re typically allowed to buy in for a minimum of ten
times the smaller dollar figure with no maximum.
In Pot-Limit, the amount you’re allowed to bet is the same as it
would be in Limit, but the amount you’re allowed to raise is equal
to the size of the pot. For example, say you’re playing in a $1/$2
Pot-Limit game and you’re under the gun. The blinds in front of you
are $1 and $2. If you want to play in the hand, your minimum call is
$2, just as if it had been a Limit game.
If you want to raise, the pot is calculated as though you already
had called. You’re allowed to raise anywhere between the amount
of the bet to call and the size of the pot. In the $1/$2 game I’ve
been talking about here, if you’re under the gun, you could raise
anything from $2 up to $5 (the pot being the two blinds [$1 + $2],
plus the theoretical “call” you would have made of the big blind
[$2]: $2 + $2 + $1 = $5). Additional raises are handled similarly
As you can see, it gets pricey fast (and man, with all this calcula-
tion, it’s no wonder people never play it).
No-Limit Hold’em
It the olden days, say 20 years ago, No-Limit was a rarely played
version of Hold’em — mostly, if not exclusively, attended by the
extremely well heeled and the terminally vicious. Learning was an
exercise in how far you were willing to drain your checking account.
Today, thanks to televised poker broadcasting, running the gamut
from the World Poker Tour to Stars You Never Really Liked Play
Poker!, No-Limit is probably the best-known version of the game.
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 41

No-Limit Hold’em is a vicious and diabolical game, where the rules
are only slightly more complicated than “you can bet any amount
at any time.”
The most common way to see a ring game No-Limit table described
is something like “$1/$2.” When you do, these are the amounts of the
blinds and the lower limits of the betting. The upper limit that can
be bet on any given hand is however much any player has sitting on
a table.
Buy-in is typically limited to a minimum of ten times the lower
dollar figure and 100 times the upper dollar figure, so for a $1/$2
No-Limit game, your buy-in could be anything between $10 and
$200. (The other way you’ll sometimes see No-Limit described is
by the maximum buy-in, say “$200.” If you see a single number
describing a No-Limit game, this is the maximum buy-in for that
game — ask the dealer what the blinds are.)
As a general rule, you want to have something very close to the
upper limit of the buy-in when you sit down at a table so you’re not
immediately intimidated (or just flat cleaned out) in a hand by
someone with a considerably larger stack.
When you sit at a No-Limit table, you’re not allowed to remove
chips from the table (that is to, say, pocket some of your winnings)
until you leave the game altogether. When you do leave a game,
you’re typically not allowed to reenter for a specified time limit
(usually 30 minutes or more).
In case you haven’t figured it out by now, No-Limit is an extremely
dangerous form of the game. Just like doing trapeze without a net,
the lack of limits on the betting doesn’t make the tricks any more
difficult — it just makes the penalties more severe. Starting out
your Hold’em career with something like a No-Limit ring game is a
very good way to watch your wallet walk south.
If you’re interested in learning No-Limit, you should play Limit first
until you’re comfortable, and then either move along to micro No-
Limit buy-ins online (see Chapter 15) or small buy-in tournaments
(Chapter 17).
The Importance of Your Bankroll
You have to pay to play, but all that play isn’t going to last very
long if you don’t have enough supporting cash behind your game
to survive the bad times.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
42

You don’t have to play poker to win. It’s perfectly fine to just have
your time at the table as a form of entertainment, but if you’re
playing to win, the total cash available to you (your bankroll) will
make the difference between ongoing enjoyment of the game and
sitting on the rail wondering what’s on TV.
If you’ve never been exposed to the basic concept of necessary
bankroll before, you’re probably going to be shocked about the
amount of money I’m talking about here. So I need you to take a
deep breath. Meditate. Go to your happy place. That’s right, play
with the cute puppy. Okay, now, read on. . . .
Recommended bankroll sizes
A bankroll is what will help you prosper when you’re winning and
stave off the poor times when you’re losing. Because of the
vagaries of luck, you need to have a thick cushion under you if you
take a big fall.
Bankroll for Limit
If you begin as a Limit player, you should have a bankroll that is at
least 300 times the maximum bet size. So for a $2/$4 game, you
should have $1,200 earmarked for your poker play.
That’s not to say you should walk up to a $2/$4 table with $1,200 in
your pocket (in fact, you definitely should not do that), but that
amount should be the amount of cash that you think of being at
your disposal against your poker quests as a whole.
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 43
The nasty truth of poker
There is a truth about poker that you’ll never see on the glamorous TV shows, nor
hear from the seasoned professionals waxing poetic about the old days: The vast
majority of poker players are losers. When I say “losers,” I don’t mean in the slacker
sense of the word, I mean in the bottom-line, ask-your-accountant sense of the word.
How many? The commonly accepted figure is 95 percent. That’s right, 19-out-of-20
poker players lose money in the long run. Kinda gives you a whole new perspective
of the number of people you see playing on a crowded poker site online or what
you’re watching on TV, doesn’t it?
Much of the loss is due to the rake (see the sidebar “The insidious rake,” earlier in this
chapter), but a nearly equal portion is due to bad bankroll management. If you’re play-
ing to win, even if you’re an extremely good and talented player, you’re asking for trou-
ble if you’re not fully prepared for the vagaries of fate with a nice, cushiony bankroll.

It’s not unusual for a beginning player to lose as many as 50 big
bets over the first several hours of poker play. A bigger bankroll
will let you ride over the top of this initial loss to watch things
grow later on.
Bankroll for No-Limit
As you would guess, No-Limit, due to the brutal nature of the game,
requires even more cushion. You should have an absolute mini-
mum bankroll of ten maximum buy-ins for the game you’re inter-
ested in playing. A $1/$2 No-Limit ring game will probably have a
maximum buy-in of $200, so a minimum bankroll for this game
would be $2,000 (and double that would actually be safer).
Bankroll for tournament play
Tournaments tend to have wilder swings — especially multi-table
tournaments where you might have a dry streak that runs for
weeks, only to hit a big one to win it all back. (Chapter 17 has more
on tournament play.)
For single-table tournaments (like those online, or satellites for
bigger tourneys), you should have 100 times the buy-in. If you play
in $10 tournaments, that means $1,000.
For multiple tables, you need even more. A bare minimum of 300
times the buy-in is more appropriate (and don’t forget to count
rebuys as part of the tournament fee). So if you’re playing in $10
tournaments where you’re rebuying twice, from your bankroll’s
point of view that’s actually a $30 tournament. This means you
need — yes, that’s right — $9,000 to weather the storm. Told ya
this would get your blood pressure up.
Moving up and moving 
down in limits
When you’ve got a nice cushy bankroll under you, you still have to
be able to adjust to your wins and losses as you play merrily along.
Keeping records
Assuming you want to be a winning player, in order to keep tabs on
how you’re doing overall, you must keep records of your play. You
can be as sophisticated as you’d like (who was playing, time of day,
what you ate), but really the most important thing is to track your
wins and losses across each poker session.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
44

A simple spreadsheet or even just a small hard-bound notebook
(spirals lose pages too easily) that you take with you will do the
trick. Write down every session, no matter how big or how small
the losses. And don’t make an excuse to not record something,
“I was really drunk at the time” doesn’t matter to a diminishing
stack of George Washingtons in your bank account.
How important is keeping records? If two players have exactly the
same level of skill — one keeps records, and the other doesn’t — the
record keeper will win more money over time because he’s more
aware of how his game is affecting his bottom line and can adjust
accordingly. Funny isn’t it, how one player can beat another over the
long run, using a technique that doesn’t involve a deck of cards?
Going down
You need to be more leery of losing than winning, so it’s the red ink
in your ledger that you should be keeping an eye on. If you find
that you’ve lost half your bankroll for the limit you assigned your-
self, you need to move down one level in the limits that you play.
So if your $2/$4 bankroll was $1,200 and you’ve seen it whittle
down to $600, you need to move over to the $1/$2 table.
You also should examine your play in general for any leaks in your
play — that is, mistakes that are costing you money.
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 45
Max: A record keeper becomes a winner
My pal Max is a big-time computer geek, and over the last few years he’s devel-
oped a deeper interest in Hold’em. He started playing regularly online, keeping
meticulous records rivaling those of even the most obsessed serial killers.
One day he came to me pretty dejected. “I’m losing. It’s not a lot, but it’s steady.”
We both frowned at his gradual sloping downward line. There was no way to argue —
he was losing. But the line was so slight, that it piqued my curiosity. “Hey, Max, run
those numbers with the rake taken out.”
He did, and sure enough, the line was now showing a winner. Max’s problem was
that he was beating the other players but he was not beating the rake.
I said, “If you move up one limit, the rake will become a smaller percentage of the
total take of any one pot. I bet if you move up one level in limits, you start winning.”
That’s exactly what he did. Without meticulous records, we never would’ve figured
it out.
Max bought me lunch at my favorite taqueria to celebrate. Now that’s what I call
winning.

Movin’ on up
If you’re in the envious position of having doubled your bankroll,
you’re now able to move up one limit at will. Yes, doubling your
bankroll is a lot to win before moving, but it will prove, without a
doubt, that you’re not on a lucky streak and give you both the
experience and confidence you need for the next level.
Moving up one limit in poker is always harder. If you assume that
after you move up you’ll automatically be as successful as you just
were, you’re opening yourself up for a (small) world of heartache.
Poker Etiquette
Poker etiquette goes beyond just being nice, being pleasant, saying
“excuse me,” and not chucking your chair at the dealer when he
turns an unfriendly card. It’s mostly rituals and customs for what
happens around a card table. Repeatedly ignoring any of the rules
listed in this section may get you removed from a professional
poker room.
Handling your cards
To play cards, you first have to know how to physically handle them.
 When you get your hole cards, don’t take them beyond the
edge of the table. Look at them quickly, memorize them, and
then protect them.
 If the cards you’re playing with are cardboard-based (like
the kind you messed around with when you were a kid), be
careful not to bend or warp them. If you notice a deck is
being warped, notify your dealer. (All-plastic playing cards,
such as Kem brand, can be bent considerably more without
warping effects.)
 Keep your cards visible at all times. This lets the other players
and the dealer know that you still have a vested interest in the
game.
 Don’t rip your cards in half when you take the most unbe-
lievable beat of your life from the guy who started dating
your ex-girlfriend and who is now mocking you. Well, maybe.
 Don’t fold out of turn. When you do fold, push them face-
down to the dealer across the felt. After you’ve pushed your
hand and let go of it, it’s officially mucked and dead.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
46

Handling your chips
You should know poker chip basics as well.
 Keep in mind that only the chips on the table are eligible
for that given hand. You are not allowed to pull chips out of
your pocket to play in a hand after cards have been dealt.
 In No-Limit, you’re not allowed to take chips off the table
until you’ve decided that you’re going to leave the game.
 In tournament play, you must keep your keeps stacked and
readily visible/countable to all players and tournament offi-
cials. You also have to carry them in full sight of everyone
when you move from table to table.
 When you want to raise a player, say “raise” to the dealer
and then place the bet on the table. If you’re playing No-
Limit, you must move the total amount of the raise in one
motion or you should call the exact amount you want to bet.
(Putting money on the table as though it were a call and then
saying “raise” to put more money out is strictly prohibited.
Doing so is known as a string raise.)
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 47
When should you show your hand?
In Hold’em, you only have to show your hand when you have a showdown winner.
The rest of the time your exposure is at your option.
You may want to show a hand if you had a very strong hand or you were beaten by
a lucky draw.
You may also want to show a hand if you pulled off a successful bluff to make your
opponents slightly more incendiary.
Remember: When you show a hand, you’re showing the tiniest bit of philosophy
about you and your play — you’re literally saying, “Yes, I play this kind of hand in this
type of situation.”
If you’re comfortable with that, and especially if it’s helping create a table image
you want to convey (for example, “I only play the best hands — I never bluff”), then
go for it.
My advice, and certainly the way I play, is to never show a hand I don’t have to. I just
prefer to keep my opponents guessing.
Don’t ever show a hand to anyone at the table when the hand is still in play. Yes,
this includes the girl with the low-cut blouse or the George Clooney look-alike who’s
sitting to your right and who isn’t currently in the hand.

 Place your bets out in front of you on the table, not mixed
in with the rest of the pot (mixing with the rest of the pot is
known as splashing). Placing your bets in front of you lets
the dealer make sure the pot has the correct bets and
amounts from all the players in it.
 Do not touch another player’s chips. Even if your halo is
glowing that day.
 Do not start moving a pot toward you until the dealer
has declared your hand a winner and is moving the pot
toward you.
 Do not bet out of turn.
Playing in turn
Poker is played clockwise, with the first person to act being to the
left of the dealer button (or to the left of the big blind pre-flop). The
closest player to your right must act before you do, so you should
be cuing off of her play. If you’re sitting next to a player who tends
to act out of turn, base your movement on the player to her right.
Playing in turn is especially important on the river. Be certain that
all betting action has ceased and no one is still waiting to make a
betting decision before you turn over your cards.
Tipping the dealer
In ring game play, tipping the dealer a buck when you win a hand is
customary. Most dealers only make minimum wage and depend on
your tips to make a living. Not to play the guilt card or anything. . . .
Keeping an eye on the game
When you play poker, especially if you’re in an unfamiliar environ-
ment, keep an eye on what’s going on around you. You have two
people you can turn to, your dealer and the floorperson.
Talking to your dealer
If you run across any problem at a table — be it the way a hand
was declared or an incorrect deal — talk to the dealer immediately.
The dealer is the boss of the table. You’ll be amazed at how many
know-it-alls on a table will try to straighten out problems or solve
big messes. They don’t have any authority in a poker room, but the
dealer does. Again, talk to the dealer.
Part I: Everything’s Bigger in Texas: Welcome to Texas Hold’em 
48

Asking for a floorperson
In my experience, dealers are most likely to make mistakes in one
of two ways:
 By incorrectly paying a board that has been counterfeited
(see Chapter 2)
 By getting too deeply involved in a conversation with some-
one else around the table
If the dealer has made a mistake — for example, paid a hand off
incorrectly, called a winning hand incorrectly, or allowed some
type of action at the table that you think is clearly egregious — ask
for the floorperson. The floorperson handles any problems at the
table and is essentially the dealer’s supervisor.
If you do need a floorperson, the demeanor of the table is likely
going to be fairly aggravated and hot. Explain the situation with the
floorperson and only speak when spoken to. Don’t argue with
other players, even if those players are talking directly to you.
Watching your manners
If you play poker long enough, you will be beaten by the turn of
an unlucky card. It’s not a question of “if,” it’s a question of “when.”
If you can’t deal with the pure concept of chance, you should seri-
ously consider taking up an all-skill game like chess. (You think
you got it bad? Take a look at what happened to the people in
Chapter 21.)
Chapter 3: Just Tell Me How to Play: Texas Hold’em Basics 49
Glimpsing someone else’s cards
You’ll be surprised how often you’ll see someone else’s cards when you’re sitting at
a table. It seems like nine times out of ten it’s either someone who is drunk or some-
one who’s otherwise out of it.
I always approach this “problem” the same way. At the conclusion of the hand where
it happens, I say, “Excuse me, you need to protect your hand — I could see your
cards there,” and I say it loud enough that most people at the table can hear it.
This strategy nearly always gets a “thanks” from the player you tell it to and for me
at least, clears the conscience. If the player exposes his hand again, I figure I’ve
warned him and just use this as another piece of information in my game.

Nobody wants to hear someone whine about a beat he just took,
and if you’re new to the game, you can be certain someone else 
sitting at the table has just had exactly the same kind of horror
unleashed upon her. Just suck it up and live with it.
It’s never okay to insult another player, throw cards at a dealer, or
hurl your beer bottle through the mirror behind the bar. If the
game is getting too tough or too intense, take a walk or call it a
night. There’s always another game somewhere.
It’s just a game, unless you’re a professional. And if you’re a profes-
sional, you should behave like one.

H
ere you’ll ﬁnd several pages devoted to each card in
a Texas Hold’em hand. I cover hole cards, ﬂop, turn,
and river in detail. I talk about the best hands to play, as
well as the hands that should make you walk away.

Chapter 4

oth the tease and the terror of Hold’em is the fact that you
start with two hole cards. It’s a lot like looking at the brochure
for the house you’ll ultimately own. Maybe the place that looks so
great in the picture actually turns out to be on top of a toxic-waste
dump. Or maybe that ratty little trap actually sits atop a gold mine.
Regardless of how you feel about the concept of judging a book by
its cover, with starter cards in Hold’em, that’s essentially what you
have to do.
The start of a hand also determines your position, that is, your
place on the table relative to the deal.
In this chapter, I take you on a stroll around the different positions
at a table and talk about the relative strength of a hand according
to where it sits.
The Importance of Position
Before I dive into talking about the hands you should be playing,
it’s worth just understanding the general concept of position.
Position will help decide if you should raise, call, or fold. Your posi-
tion can leave you stumbling blindly through a hand, or make you
surprisingly educated about what’s happening around the table.
The easiest way to think of a poker table is by position relative
to the dealer button and then group those seats into sets (see
Figure 4-1). I use these groups throughout the book.

Figure 4-1: Relative position of early-, middle-, and late-position seats.
Early position
Seats in the early position are the ones that are first, second, third,
and fourth from the dealer button. The problem with these seats is
that you have no idea what cards the people behind you have, and
worse, there are a lot of people behind you. When you’re forced to
act in early position, you’ll continually be acting early for every
betting round. For this reason alone, you should act only when you
have premium cards (and fold everything else). Jack-Queen might
look like a sweetheart here, but over the long run, it’ll rip you to
pieces when you play it from early position.
You may have noticed that early position has an interesting anom-
aly, and that is seats 1 and 2 from the dealer button are already
covered by blinds. So in Seat 1 with the small blind, you may get
a chance to see a hand for what is essentially half a bet (another
small blind to see the big blind). In Seat 2 you might get to see the
hand for “free,” because if no one raised you’re already in.
When you’re in the big blind, watch the betting round as it comes
to you. If you try to fold when it’s your turn, the dealer may push
your cards back at you and say, “You can check for free,” but all
the people at the table will know that you’re now holding a hand
that you have no interest in. Players can, and will, try to force you
to fold based on this information.
In the blinds, you may be interested in playing hands because you
already have a portion of a bet on the felt — and in some cases,
that intuition is right (see Chapter 12 for more about mathematics
and pot odds). Never forget, however, that after the pre-flop betting

round, the blinds are the first hands that will see action — and for
this reason they’re continually at more risk of being attacked than
other hands at the table.
Unless you’re playing No-Limit, where you have the ability of put-
ting down a mercilessly large raise, raising from the blinds will
almost never get other players in the game to fold. So although
you’ll essentially gain a round of betting by raising, you’ve also
switched on a bright neon sign that blinks “Hey look! I’ve got a
hand!” Although that may gain you one bet in the short run, it will
lose you more in the long run. (Only the masochistic and the termi-
nally dull will repeatedly call a player they know has a great hand
throughout all the betting rounds.) With a big hand, you’re better
off not raising and slow-playing instead (see Chapter 10 for more).
Middle position
The fifth, sixth, and seventh seats are known as middle position,
and here things start to get interesting. You’ve already had a
chance to see about half the table act (you can’t be sure what the
blinds are going to do unless you see a tell — see Chapter 8) and in
some cases if you place a bet, you’ll be the first person to do so
because everyone else has folded.
Because you’re sitting farther back in the order, you can run a little
wilder. Play cards that are a bit worse — then when you actually
do manage to hit a hand, the people in front of you may try to bet
and you can return with some neighborly favor like a raise.
Chapter 4: Beginning with Two 55
“Take Seat 4 on Table 33”
If you’re waiting for a seat in a professional card room (or if you’ve drawn a seat to
play in a tournament) you’ll be given a seat and table number.
Most tables are identified by number, either right next to the chip tray on the felt, or
from signs hanging above them on the ceiling.
The seats are numbered clockwise from the dealer starting with 1 and going up to
however many, and the seats hold that number irrespective of the position of the
dealer marker. If you ever have a question about the table you should be going to,
ask your floorperson; if you ever have a question about sitting in the right seat, ask
your dealer.

This isn’t like being in Candyland, though. You still have about half
the table to act behind you, as well as those pesky blinds.
As you play from the middle, be sure to keep an eye on the actions
of the people behind you, especially the people who are raising.
Those people are indicating hands of strength and you don’t want
to go out blindly betting in following rounds only to get raised, yet
again, by the guy who has already nailed you once pre-flop.
Late position
The eighth, ninth, and (if there is one) tenth seats (lots of online
tables have only nine seats) are late position. These are the rumble
seats on the poker jalopy and are way fun. Because you’ve already
seen all the action in front of you, you can make decisions like
making calls purely on pot odds (see Chapter 12), raising with not-
so-great hands when no one else has played, or folding marginal
hands when it’s clear there’s going to be bloodshed in front of you.
Even if those bratty little people sitting in the blinds decide to raise
you pre-flop (because they act after you), you’ll be all over them like
ugly on an ape after the flop because you get to act last repeatedly.
In a poker game, money tends to flow around the table in a clock-
wise fashion. The reason for this is due almost exclusively to the
concept of position, and especially late position. The last people to
act bring in the most because people either fold to the late-position
bets or call the late-position raises and lose.
The only real difficulty of playing in late position is that everyone
knows that it rocks. Just like Lovers’ Lane, it has a reputation for
being the spot where somewhat seedy things, such as stealing the
blinds (raising from late position with garbage merely to try to
gobble up blinds when no one else has bet) happens.

Although they’re in early position, the small and large blinds do
have a bit of play in them, exclusively because you were forced to
play a bet when you were dealt the hand.
From the small blind, if you have not been raised, you can play:
 Any set of suited connectors, even if they’re gapped (for
example, 7 10)
 Any set of connecting cards greater than 6 (for example, 6-7)
 Any two cards if more than half the table is playing (good pot
odds for you)
From the big blind you can call any single raise with anything in
the preceding list.
Chapter 4: Beginning with Two 57

If either blind is raised multiple times, call with any of the cards
listed in the early position (refer to Table 4-1).
When playing either the small or large blinds, particularly if there
are a lot of players in the hand, be ready to fold post-flop if your
hand doesn’t improve significantly.
Be aware of a few things relative to the table I’ve supplied:
 If you figured out your original Hold’em hands from Poker
For Dummies by Richard Harroch and Lou Krieger (Wiley),
you’ll notice that I advocate playing a tighter subset than
they have in that book. (They list hands that I don’t recom-
mend playing.) I’ve done this because it’s easier to start with
a tight game and then loosen a bit than it is to start loose
and tighten it up. Those authors themselves admit their rec-
ommendations are loose in that book — and I agree. Early in
your poker career, your big goal will be to cut your losses to
a minimum — and my recommendations will help.
 Many people recommend playing an Ace with a weak kicker
out of a later position (known as a dangling Ace), but in my
experience, especially with players just learning the game,
these hands will lose you more over time than they win
(usually from someone in the blinds having an Ace with a

No-Limit modifications
The guidelines in the section “The Hands You Should Play, by Relative Position at a
Table” are for Limit, as opposed to No-Limit. I strongly recommend you cut your
Hold’em teeth on Limit (instead of getting them busted out in No-Limit), until you get
a feel of the game. Then move ahead to No-Limit.
For No-Limit tournaments, consider moving the bottom rank of every category up at
least one (for example, only play a suited Ace through Jack in early position rather
than Ace through 10). This helps protect your bankroll (because after you lose all
your chips, you’re out). (See Chapter 17 for more on tournaments.)
For No-Limit ring games, consider moving the bottom rank of every category down
one (for example, play a suited Ace through 9 in early position rather than Ace
through 10). This gives you more of an ability to play spoiler hands after the flop, but
requires considerable skill to do well. No-Limit ring game play goes well beyond
“beginning” poker, so I don’t cover it much in this book.

bigger kicker). Remember: The more people who fold in front
of you, the more implication there is that good cards are still
left in the deck (or in the players’ hands waiting to play).
 Call any bet if there is a raise behind you, but be ready to
let that hand go if you don’t improve post-flop. Your decision
to play forward will be based partially on how you classify
that player. (See Chapter 8 for more on those tricks.)
 If there is a raise in front of you, you should only call if you
have hands that are the equivalent of sitting one positional
group in front of where you are. For example, from a late
position, you should no longer call with a J-10, but can call a
bet and a raise with Q-J. Again, be ready to let the hand go if it
doesn’t improve post-flop.
 Be certain to vary your starting cards relative to the other
players at the table if that makes sense. (See Chapter 8 for
more on this.)
Considering the Players in a Hand
After you’ve figured out what hand to play and where, you’re only
beginning to get a true, deeper feel of the game. You have to keep
track of a whole bunch of other things, too. I cover some of them in
the following sections.
Keeping track of the number 
of players
The number of players in a hand is critical for your chances of
success. Keeping track of the people in front of you is pretty easy,
because you’re always hearing them yap it up about checking, bet-
ting, or raising.
The danger is it’s sometimes easy to lose track of the players 
playing behind you because the pressure and excitement of your
declaring your action has passed and you can easily drop into a
low form of stupor waiting for your next turn to act.
You don’t have to be a math wizard to know that the more people
you see staying in a hand, the more likely you are to lose. Also, if
people are staying in against multiple raises, either they’re suicidal
or, more likely, they have great hands.
Chapter 4: Beginning with Two 59

Watching the types of players
The players in a hand make a huge difference as to whether you
should be raising, checking, or folding. The madman who will play
any two cards under the gun is to be treated in a very different way
from the woman who will only play A-A in the same position.
If you have a choice at a poker table, you always want the most
aggressive player sitting to your right. Although it’s true that if this
person is a bit of a monster you’ll see a whole lot of raising (much
of it probably causing you to fold), it’s much better to know that
action is coming along than to have it happen behind you. Because
when the Hell Raiser is behind you, you bet, and he raises, and
then you may have to fold and just give a bet away.
Also, it’s pointless to raise another player if he’s continually going
to call you when you don’t think you have a better hand (or at
least, are trying to convince him that you do). True, it sweetens the
pot, but if it’s not clear in your mind that you have a good shot at
winning said pot, that extra money you’re betting could just as
easily walk away from you.

How good is that guy’s starting hand?
Imagine you’re playing at a table and everyone has folded to a person just in front
of you in middle position and that person raises. You look at your hand and you’re
holding an off-suit A-Q. A good hand and you can definitely call, but you may be able
to get a better feel for what the other guy has by raising. If he’s playing something
close to the hands that I outline in this chapter, that hand could be anything rang-
ing from A-A to J-Q off-suit (or even worse depending on his current mindset and
how much he values a hand like 4-4).
Now, it’s true that your reraise helps indicate to the table that you have a very high-
quality hand, but that’s kind of the point. A lot of people behind you (maybe even all
of them at a tight table) will fold. When the action comes back down on the original
raising player, his action will tell you something.
If he does not reraise, that indicates he has a very good, but not great hand. If he
comes right back at you with a raise, it may mean he has something very hot, or just
doesn’t want to be pushed around.
It’s certainly not a foolproof method, but you’ll be surprised how well it works —
especially over time and at lower-limit tables.

The harder a person is to bluff, the less you should try to bluff him.
Keep an eye on those players and, when they are in, their position
relative to you.
In general you want to get a good classification of the players 
sitting around a table. Just be careful that you don’t become 
prejudicial about it.
For example, if you’re playing and you notice that a person raises
with pocket threes under-the-gun, that’s a good indication that
either she overvalues pocket pairs, or she doesn’t fully understand
the importance of position. As long as there aren’t extenuating cir-
cumstances (like being a significant chip leader in a short-handed
tournament), keep track of that in your mind — and your position
of that person relative to your play. Remember: As the dealer
button orbits the table, sometimes that person will be behind you
in turn, and other times in front of you.
In Chapter 8, I go into more detail on playing and classifying play-
ers, but here are some general things to watch for when it comes
to the starting hole cards:
 Loose players: These are players who either play too many
hands or bet too much on the hands they do play.
 Tight players: These players play only the very best starting
hands — very possibly a smaller subset of the list I’ve
described by position in Table 4-1.
 Aggressive players: These are people who raise, raise, raise.
 Bluffers: You should try to establish, very roughly, every
player’s likelihood to bluff at a table.
 Timid players: These players are the ones who are likely
to fold.
Hands You Should and
Should Not Play
I’ve already shown the hands you should play earlier in the chapter,
and everything outside that list shouldn’t be played. It’s time to look
at some more-specific examples.
Chapter 4: Beginning with Two 61

Probable winners
There are a few big hands that when you have them, you have a very
good chance to walk all the way through the hand with a winner. 
A-A, K-K, and Q-Q all fall in this category. But always be aware that
the fewer players at the table, the more likely you are to win.
Big Slick (Ace-King) is a great starting hand, more so if it’s suited,
but it is purely a drawing hand. As I cover in Chapter 5, the flop
determines the quality of that hand.
Quite possible losers
Small pairs are very dangerous. Especially on lower-limit tables,
it’s common to see people over-bet hands such as 5-5 and 6-6.
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
62
Riding the pocket rockets
On average, once every 220 hands you’ll be dealt American Airlines — it is special
enough of a hand to merit its own discussion.
If you’re dealt A-A at a table and everyone calls all the way through — the odds are
less than 50 percent that you’ll win the hand. This is part of the reason it’s important
that you not only raise with this hand early to drop a few competitors out but also
be aware that it’s vulnerable. Yes, it’s true that your raise will let people know you
have a hot hand, but it may prevent a few less suckouts.
Pocket Aces get beaten (cracked) all the time and are particularly vulnerable to
people with smaller pairs catching trips as well as flushes in unmatching suits and
lower straights.
The beauty of the hand is that it’s the best possible starter. The bad thing is that it’s
not a very good drawing hand. There are only two more Aces in the deck and for
straights or flushes you have to have four community cards of that type.
Be happy when you have pocket rockets and don’t be afraid to bet them. Just be
aware that they’re vulnerable and sometimes they will be beaten.
If you get in a hand that’s starting to look bad, you can help dampen your losses by
checking and calling. Or wet them down even more by getting out altogether.
Interesting side note: If you know, for certain, that your opponent has A-A, the best
possible hand you can have in defense is a 6-7 in the suit that is not the same as
either Ace. Such a combination has flush possibilities, lots of straights, and caps
any 2-3-4-5 community cards for the wheel play.

There also seems to be an infatuation with pocket Jacks and the
only reason I can think of (I know it sounds like I’m joking, but I’m
serious) is that it has a lot of paint on it so it looks better than it is.
In fact, if you’re playing J-J against two other players with one
having a King-X, the other having a Queen-X (Xs being any card
less than Jack), and the players play to the end, the pocket Jacks
have about a 50 percent chance of winning. And you’re going to be
running into hands that are much better than that.
Gapped connectors can also cause you problems, especially ones
with triple gaps such as 6-10. The problem with this hand is the
only way you’re going to make it straighten out with both cards
is to end up with a community play of 7-8-9. If someone is playing
10-Jack here, you’re dead meat.
Small suited connectors have similar problems. A little diamond
mine like 2 3 can be beaten by any two higher diamonds.
Worse, you want to see the community cards come out with exactly
three diamonds — because if there are four, anyone with another
diamond beats you automatically. Gross.
Again, keep an eye on players at the table. If someone is playing
extremely limited hands under the gun and you see him raise, you
should be folding any hand that is not A-A, K-K, or A-K; because
that’s the only hand he would be playing out of that position.
Borderline hands
If you’re playing any of the hands toward the bottom of Table 4-1,
you’re definitely down into borderline territory.
There’s an interesting irony here because those hands are all much
stronger against a fewer number of players, simply because they
don’t have to beat more people. But they pay better if you’re up
against multiple players.
The answer to this is conundrum is to go ahead and play them in
both situations, but the flop is where the truth will start to be told.
If you’re up against multiple players, you must flop extremely well.
If you’re up against only one opponent, you may be able to bet in
such a way that your opponent thinks you flopped well. (Read
Chapter 5 to find out about flop play and what it means.)
Chapter 4: Beginning with Two 63

Using “Fold or Raise”
to Make a Call
Before ending this chapter it’s worth mentioning a general rule of
poker that you should incorporate deeply into your mind: It takes
a better hand to call than it does to place an initial bet.
The easiest way to understand this rule is to look at an extreme
example: Imagine playing at a table with ten players. Everyone is
still in the hand, and with all five community cards faceup, nine
players in front of you have called. You have the third highest pair
with the board. What should you do?
Fold (of course). Someone has a better hand. In this situation there
are just too many cards and too many players. The farther back
you are in that ring, the better your hand needs to be because
you’re playing against so many players.
There’s a good trick you can use with deciding to call — ask your-
self if it’s better to fold or raise in that position. If you don’t feel
good about raising (“There’s no way this is a raise”), then it may
well not even be a call. This isn’t to say that you have to raise with
your hand — you certainly can go ahead and call — but it sets a
very good litmus test for you.
This theory applies across all forms of Hold’em, but it’s a particu-
larly good guideline in No-Limit. There, I take this theory one
brutal step farther and instead of simply calling, I raise.

Chapter 5
Flopping ’Til You’re Dropping
In This Chapter
 Seeing your hand develop with a flop
 Making your bets
 Considering calling
 Pondering the raise
 Check-raising versus waiting
 Coaxing free cards from the future
O
n the whole, the flop is the most critical part of a Hold’em
hand. You go from having two hole cards to — boom! —
having a full poker hand. Love it or hate it, at least one of the cards
you’re staring at on the table will now be a part of your poker hand.
The flop is also the place where you make your last “cheap” bet,
because betting rounds on the turn and river will cost you double
what they do here.
Fitting or Folding
When the flop hits the table, you have definition of your hand. 
Five-sevenths (or about 70 percent) of all the cards possible for
the hand are now known.
A flop relative to your hand is a lot like the weather. When you
wake up and look out the window, you don’t have a guarantee of
what the rest of the day is going to be like (or that you won’t be hit
by lightning), but the general patterns give you a pretty good idea
of what’s up for the day.
The thing you need to be most concerned about is whether the
flop (to borrow from Poker For Dummies) fits your hand. In other

words, does your hand improve with the flop you see? Likewise,
you want to think about how that very same flop may or may not
improve the other people’s hands around the table.
Great flops
The flop fits your hand very well if any of the following are true (in
descending order of greatness):
 You’ve flopped a straight flush. It’s always thrilling when it
happens — and, if you’re overtly emotional, it may give you a
chance to see what your skeleton looks like when it jumps out
of your body.
 You’ve flopped a full house. Fun. Especially when it’s some-
thing bizarre, like you hold 3-8 on the big blind (no one has
raised, so you’re playing for free) and the flop is 3-8-3.
 You’ve flopped the nut flush.
 You’ve flopped the nut straight.
 You’ve flopped quads.
 You’ve flopped trips.
 You’ve flopped two pair, with one of the pair being top of the
board. For example, you’re holding A-3 and the board is A-10-3.
Good flops
The flop is definitely good for you in any of the following situations:
 You’ve flopped a flush or straight that is not the best possi-
ble for a given board. You probably have a winner here, but
you have to be just a tad leery of people holding cards over
yours — this is particularly true for those players who are
now holding a four-flush with a singleton that is above your
best hole card.
 You’ve flopped two pair that do not include the bottom pair.
 You’ve flopped top pair with the best kicker. For example,
you’re holding A-K and the flop is A-8-4, or you’re holding A-9
and the flop is 9-2-7.
 You hold a pocket pair that’s higher than the board. Say,
you’re holding 10-10 with a low-ball flop of 2-3-7. You still have
a mild vulnerability here to trips and two pair (particularly
from the blinds).
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
66

Very borderline flops
Then there are flops that do make your hand better but leave you
possibly exposed:
 You flop a pair that isn’t the best possible. Say you hold Q-J
and the flop is K-Q-9, or you hold J-10 and the flop is A-Q-10.
 You flop a four-flush or a four-straight. Odds are you won’t
make this hand on the next two cards, but you may be forced
to play it for pot odds reasons (see Chapter 12 for more info).
 You flop top pair but have kicker trouble. This situation is
particularly a problem with Aces, because the whole table
likes to hold onto them. If you’re playing a suited A-2 from late
position with five people still in the hand and the flop is A-7-5
rainbow, I guarantee you that you have a loser. (Right this
second, all it takes is an opponent who has an Ace and any
card bigger than a 5.)
From a bankroll perspective, you should think of the hands listed
here as being some of the most dangerous hands at a poker table.
The problem is that they tease you along to play more (sometimes
even jacking with your mind in such a way that you become more
convinced that your opponents are bluffing), but they’re rife with
holes.
Downright dangerous flops
Then there are those little places in Horrorville that occasionally
crop up:
 You’ve hit the bottom end of a straight, but the flop is also
flushing. For example, you have 8 9 and the flop is 10
J Q.
 You hold a great pocket pair and bigger cards hit the board
(especially when they’re in quantity). For example, you have
Q-Q and the flop is A-A-K. If there is more than just a player or
two in the pot, guess what? That’s right, your great starter of
pocket Queens is now a loser.
 You have a flop that misses your hand, but still gives you
over cards. For example, you hold A-K in middle position and
you see a Q-5-4 flop, with immediate action from the small or
large blinds.
Chapter 5: Flopping ‘Til You’re Dropping 67

Just plain bad flops
Any flop that doesn’t fit your hand at all (and you don’t have a
pocket pair) is bad — more so if you don’t even hold an Ace.
The answer in this situation is almost always exactly what you’d
guess: Fold.
In Hold’em, especially until you get a better feel for the game and
your opponents, you want to start off with the fundamental con-
cept that if the flop doesn’t fit your hand, you should fold. Yes, you
will occasionally be bluffed out, but caution and folding will save
you money as you learn. Watching other people see if that guy
who’s betting is bluffing is less costly for you and will give you
more objective feel for the other players at the table (because your
money isn’t at stake).
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
68
The best of both worlds
You may get flops that play into your hand in multiple ways. For example, if you have
A 5 with a flop of J 5 3, you’re now holding second pair (with best kicker)
and the nut flush draw.
There are three obvious ways this hand can improve on the turn or river:
 If you draw a club, you have the nut flush.
 If you draw another 5, you have trips.
 If you draw an Ace, you have a strong two pair.
(There’s also the freak runner-runner of drawing a 4 and a 2 on the turn and river for
making the wheel. But this possibility shouldn’t be part of your decision making —
it’s not likely enough to happen, but it is part of the hand.)
Any time your hand works in multiple directions, it’s far better than having only one
path to victory, and you should be more eager to play it. This rule is especially true
in No-Limit. You may have an instance where you know you have an identical hand
with an opponent. Say you’re holding A K and the board has Q J 10.
From the play at the table, you’re certain your opponent also has A-K. You should
move as much money on the table as possible — not because you’re trying to make
your royal flush — but because any diamond turned will give you a flush and beat
your opponent’s Broadway straight.
In poker slang, this situation, where you can draw cards at the mercy of your oppo-
nent with a currently identical hand, is called a freeroll. (Yes, it’s the same term used
to describe a tournament with no entry fee.)

Betting the Flop
Now that you have an idea of what category your flop falls into,
we come down to the little details of betting. Unlike with your hole
cards, where blinds force action at the table, checking all the way
around the table after a flop is possible.
The way that players bet on the flop, and especially your position
at the table, will come into play here.
When you’re playing Hold’em, on the hole card and flop rounds,
you bet one set amount. The amount you bet doubles on the turn
and the river.
Because of this, you may want to make some bets now, in an effort
to not make more costly bets later. You may also want to wait and
not represent a good hand just yet — this strategy may give you a
chance to make more money later.
Sizing up the table for a bet
The prime rule of anything economic — but especially poker — is
to maximize your wins and minimize your losses. With all betting
actions at a poker table, this concept should ride paramount in
your mind (well above the fact that the cocktail waitress has really
nice hair).
I think asking yourself a few questions helps. And don’t sweat it:
At first these questions may seem like a lot to consider, but after
you’ve played some, they’ll all become second nature.
How many players do you want?
If you have a very good hand, you may well want as many players
in the hand as you can keep. The amount you’re betting will double
next round, so anyone who is still in the hand at the end of this
round will be forced to decide to play for double in the next. This
is great if you’re on top and sucks rocks if you’re not.
If you make any fence sitters fold now, you definitely won’t get
their bets next round.
However, if you have a hand that can be beaten with a draw (or a
wide number of draws), you may want to bet to get people out of
the hand now — or at the very least make them pay to see cards.
Chapter 5: Flopping ‘Til You’re Dropping 69

Who is still left to act in the hand and how do they behave?
If you have some monster opponent at your table who always
raises and always plays to the end, don’t go out firing a bet if you
lack confidence in your hand. You know that guy is going to raise
and there’s no need to squander an extra bet.
Likewise, if you know that a player at the table only plays post-flop
when she has a nut hand, go ahead and set a bet out right now. If
she folds, you’re done. If she calls, you know your hand has to get
significantly better on the turn or she has you beat. It’s still been a
good bet on your part, though, because you found out the strength
of her hand now, while the betting is half-priced.
Make sure to see Chapter 8 for more information about getting an
understanding of the players at a table.
Making the bet
If there has been heavy raising and reraising pre-flop, especially if
any of it has come from behind you, you’re better off checking
around the table than letting that player bet again — regardless of
what happened with your hand on the flop. Nine times out of ten
the raiser will be on some kind of adrenaline rush anyway from
looking at a nice pair of hole cards, and he’ll go ahead and fire a
bet right on out when given a chance.
By checking to him, you save yourself a raise, and even if you want
to raise, the check-raise will almost certainly work here.
Assuming you don’t have any maniacal super-aggressive beasts
prowling at your table, if the flop has fit your hand, you should bet
it. If you’re playing the cards I recommend in this book (and you
should be, at least until you get supremely comfortable with the
game), you’re going to be folding the vast majority of hands. You’ll
be folding so much that when you do play a hand, you need a
return on your betting investment.
In general, it takes a better hand to call than it does to bet, so by
betting you’re gleaning (somewhat imperfect) information about
the hands around the table. You’re also taking control of the game,
which has some value.
If you get raised when you make a bet, consider both your oppo-
nent (for example, is she the kind of person who typically does
this) and especially reexamine the flop (is there something in the
flop you’re missing?).
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
70

Straight draws and flush draws are the obvious threats, and they
can easily sneak up on you. The other thing that will nail you is
hidden trips. Someone (usually in late position) holds a smaller
pair and may have managed to match the board.
If you have four cards to a straight or flush, from a purely mathe-
matical point of view the best thing to do is to check because the
odds are that you will not be making your straight or flush (see
Chapter 12 for more on the math here). However, if you think that
you have a pretty good chance of getting people to fold by betting,
you should go ahead and bet the hand here.
If you’re the last person to act and everyone has checked to you,
you should bet if the flop fits your hand in any way. This bet
implies to the table that you do, in fact, have a hand — and on
extremely tight tables, it may win the pot for you outright.
From later position, check only if you have a true monster hand
(which will guarantee a win on the next card at double the betting
value) or the flop missed you entirely.
Calling a Bet
This is the edge of a more complicated territory.
If someone else has bet, you know a couple of things about his hand:
He thought that his starting hole cards were good enough to play in
the first place (or he was forced to play by being on the blinds), and
now he’s implying that the flop has somehow fit his hand.
The most important thing to consider on a call is the character of
the person who has placed the original bet. Is he aggressive?
Timid? Hotheaded? Mad about losing the last hand? Drunk? Get a
good feeling about this before you make a decision to call. (See
Chapter 8 for more about understanding your opponents.)
Hands that somewhat fit the flop can call. After all, this is still a
cheap betting round and the turn may produce a card that fits your
hand even better. Plus, your betting opponent may become less
aggressive on the turn because he may not have that strong of a
hand either and may have been just testing your mettle.
On the other hand, the turn card may come up anemic, making
your not-so-great-fitting flop seem even worse — and making it
easier to fold.
Hands that fit the flop well can call and can even consider raising,
which I discuss in the following section.
Chapter 5: Flopping ‘Til You’re Dropping 71

You do not have to have the winning hand of the moment to be
correct in calling. In fact, you can know that you’re an underdog —
but as long as you have pot odds in your favor (see Chapter 12 for
more on those), you’re still right in making a call.
If calling seems to be too hard of a decision, I always fall back on
my old standby question: With a bet in front of me, would I rather
fold or raise with the hand I’m currently holding? If you ask yourself
this question and the answer is “raise,” then you at least have a
call. If the answer is “fold,” then just give up the hand right now.
The hand will only get more expensive and complicated from here,
not cheaper.
It is a supremely bad idea, especially in Limit, to decide on the
flop that someone is bluffing and start calling them from now
until the last bet on the river. If you think someone is bluffing it’s
possible that:
 You’re wrong. She actually does have a hand and you’re
watching your money walk away.
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
72
“I know that guy is bluffing”
Several times in my poker career I’ve run across people who either, by their tells or
their pattern of play, I knew were bluffing. I only had one problem: I didn’t have a
hand either.
Consider this scenario: You’re on the button with a 5 6, the small blind raises
and the big blind folds. You’ve played at this table for six hours with the same guy
on the small blind and the only time he has raised from that spot was when he was
trying to get the large blind to fold and bluff down another lone player.
The flop is A A 9, and he bets.
Now you know for sure he doesn’t have a 9 or an Ace. He shakes like a leaf when
he has a good hand and he’s sitting there solid as a rock. In fact, he’s talking to you,
and he only talks when he’s bluffing. You know that if you raise, he’ll call and check-
call you all the way through the hand. He’s done it eight times at this table, and he’ll
do it again. He wants to see what you have.
He doesn’t believe you have an Ace, because you always raise from late-position
pre-flop when you do (oops — that’s a tell) and you didn’t this hand.
The real problem here is that your hand isn’t good enough to call him on his bluff. If
he has a card bigger than a 6 (and he almost certainly does), you’re beat. Which
means the bitter truth is that you’re right, he’s bluffing — and even so, you have to
fold. Just accept the fact that the flop missed this hand and go on to the next one.

 She doesn’t have a hand yet, but she’ll end up making one.
This scenario is possible with a semi-bluff (see Chapter 9) or if
the player just gets lucky.
 She may have a hand that’s better than yours — even if she
is bluffing.
Raising the Dough
The rough guidelines of raising are to (a) consider how you want
the person you’ll be raising to react to your bet, and (b) make the
action that will most help you with these interests.
Ask yourself how likely a person is to fold to a raise, and then:
 If you want that person to fold and you don’t believe she
will, don’t bother raising and just call. You’re not helping
your situation.
 If you don’t want the person to fold, but you believe she
will, wait and just call the hand for now. The river round will
cost twice as much money and you’ll make more that way.
 If you believe she may raise you back, and you don’t want
to call that raise, don’t raise her right now. The best way to
stop a raising war is to not do it yourself.
 If you believe she may raise you back, and that’s what you
want, what are you waiting for? Go go go. (Hey, are you sure
you know what you’re doing?)
 If you don’t care whether the person raises or folds, you
should raise. You must have a pretty good hand, and if she
folds, you know you win right now. If she doesn’t fold, you’ll
probably just win even more money later.
 If you’re not sure how she’ll react, raise. Then you’ll find
out — and you’ll almost certainly control the hand on the turn.
Bluffing is much more difficult in Limit than it is in No-Limit, because
the penalty for calling — at least in the short term — just isn’t that
severe. For now, you should hold back on your aspirations of getting
people to back away from the pot with your 2-7 off-suit.
Check-Raising
If you check during your turn, then raise when someone behind you
has bet, this is known as a check-raise. It is, very rightly, considered
Chapter 5: Flopping ‘Til You’re Dropping 73

to be one of the most aggressive things you can do on a card table
(but not as bad as, say, throwing your drink in someone’s face).
You should check-raise on the flop in just a few, very specific
circumstances:
 You have a very good hand, but the number of players cur-
rently playing is too big and needs to be reduced.
 You’re playing against someone whom you know you’re
beating and you’re certain he’ll call and be the first person
to bet next round. If he will not be the first to bet next round,
you should simply call and raise on the turn — you get an
extra bet out of him that way.
 You have the best hand, it’s most likely going to remain the
best, and you’re playing at a table full of maniacs who will
most likely cap all betting rounds, until . . . you pull down
the largest pot of your life! This is a level of thrill that is vir-
tually unmatched in poker.
 You think a check-raise will very likely work as a bluff now
and get your timid competitor to fold before this same little
stunt doubles in price next round.
 You think you can get a “free card” by check-raising. (See
the “Getting a Free Card” section of this chapter for more.)
 You know that someone is playing for a draw, and you’re
beating him right this second, but you’ll lose the hand if
he’s successful in getting the card he needs. The reason to
raise after checking is because you may be able to get him to
fold right now — and even if you don’t, you want to make him
pay as dearly as possible to see each following card.
In any other situation, you’re better off just calling and waiting for
the next round. Check-raising always draws attention from even the
sleepiest of players at the table, and it may well not be attention
that you want.
The best hand does win a pot, you don’t have to bet it repeatedly
to make it better, and on the flop round (which is only half-price),
you very likely are losing extra money.
If you think of a bet-raise-and-call being worth 4 units from a total
of two people after the final call (bet 1 + call 1 + raise 1 + call 1),
that same play is worth 8 on the turn (bet 2 + call 2 + raise 2 + call
2). Even if your opponent folds on a check-raise on the turn, you’ve
still made an extra 2 units from what you would have on a folded
check-raise on the flop. (You would have called your opponent’s
single bet on the flop and then raised his 2-unit bet on the river —
he put in 3, rather than 1.)
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
74

Check-raising definitely does have its place, but usually you’ll find
it later in the game.
No-Limit is a bit different. You want to consider using a very heavy
check-raise on any opponent who’s on a draw. The problem here,
of course, is that you have to be dead certain that he is drawing
(instead of just having you flat-out beaten), and there are many
players who will semi-bluff back at you with an all-in.
Getting a Free Card
There is one big exception to the check-raising rule: If you think
you can get a free card by doing it, it’s worth trying. This exception
is easiest to describe by example.
The free card setup
Typically, you want to try for a free card if you’re trying to make a
straight or flush draw.
Say you’re playing J 10 out of a late position and there was one
flat-caller pre-flop from a middle position — meaning, three people
are still in: you, the flat-caller, and the big blind.
The flop is Q 5 2.
The big blind checked, the middle position bet, and the action is on
you. You have a flush draw here, but most likely you don’t have the
Chapter 5: Flopping ‘Til You’re Dropping 75
The impropriety of check-raising
In the early days of poker, check-raising was considered to be ungentlemanly and
unsportsmanlike conduct — so much so that the act was considered to be a brusque
form of general unfairness and not allowed in many professional card rooms.
Over time, check-raising was allowed, in an effort not only to up the house take but
also to make more customers happy.
Even today, you can see the vestigial remnants of this rule. Many of the older pro-
fessional card rooms around the United States have “Check and raise is allowed”
written into their card-room rules. Next time you wander into a brick-and-mortar
place, have a look and see if that rule is still there if you’re in need of a chuckle.
And if you want to see a really interesting reaction, call a floorperson over and ask
if his card room allows check and raise.

best current hand (all it takes is one player with a card bigger than
a Jack). A call might barely give you pot odds (see Chapter 12).
But if you raise here, what’s likely to happen?
 Both players could fold and you win. That’s pretty great.
 One player could reraise you, in which case you know she has
some form of a smokin’-good hand (either trips or an A-J in
this situation). Assuming you don’t have pot odds for drawing
your flush, you could fold.
 Most likely, one or both players will call. They perceive you as
having a good hand (or maybe just trying to bluff), but the
flop has slightly fit their hands as well. They call you, waiting
to see the turn.
And here is where the beautiful part happens. On the turn, anyone
still in the hand checks to you. If that player has made a hand, he’s
going to wait for you to bet so he can check-raise you. If he missed,
or if he’s still just in a so-so position, he’s waiting for you to bet
and then he’ll make a decision on what to do. But because you’re
last to act, you don’t have to bet. If you miss your card on the
draw, you simply check and the dealer will summarily bang out the
river card. If you made your hand, you just go ahead and bet.
What this effectively means is that you get a free river card. And
you saw the turn for half-price, because your raise was less than a
call on the turn would have been.
Defending against a free card
Now that you know the trick to get a free card, you can also defend
against it. Any time on the flop that you see a raise behind you,
with what appears to be a board draw — again, flushes and
straights — you can either reraise before the turn if you have a
very good hand, or simply call and then bet (instead of checking)
when it’s your action on the turn.
Notice that I’m talking about draws here, not made hands. Raising
into a person with an all-club board showing is foolish at best, and
suicidal at worst.

Chapter 6
Taking Your Turn
In This Chapter
 Filling out your hand on fourth street
 Chronicling the action
A
ll in all, the turn isn’t as pivotal a card as its name makes it
seem. The flop holds the major moment of the hand, the river
sets the stage for a victor, but the turn lies in the nether world. It’s
a nasty place of bad economics where the prices double and the
number of cards is reduced.
Poker wags like to say that the “turn plays itself.” That’s a state-
ment that’s more true than it is false, but it doesn’t mean it’s not
worth talking about.
Watching a Hand Fill Out
Of all the cards you receive in Hold’em, the turn is the least
momentous. Only the clinically insane would have stayed through
the flop for a double draw — meaning, drawing two cards to a
straight or a flush — so it’s unlikely that this is the point that your
hand will suddenly be broken in that fashion.
However, bets double here and on the river, so if you make a mis-
take or a loose call here — as opposed to on the flop — it will cost
you twice as much. And in the long run, the incorrect call on the
turn is what will endanger your bankroll.
In broad terms, on the turn your hand will either be improving or
getting worse. This isn’t quite as stupid as it sounds, because when
you stop and think about it, if your hand is staying the same, it’s
potentially degrading relative to the field (if there are a lot of play-
ers in the hand, it definitely is degrading).

Odds are that your hand won’t be improving on the turn because
you have to either pair a card or improve a straight or flush. And in
Hold’em, for any given hand, the odds are always against that
improvement happening. Therefore, when you do improve, you’re
very likely gaining with respect to the rest of the table, and (assum-
ing that card isn’t helping your opponent even more) you may well
be passing them.
That’s great because these are exactly the kinds of problems you
want to have in poker. This particular one being the what-do-I-do-
when-I’m-winning problem. Your big decision is whether you
should check-raise or bet.
To check-raise or bet: 
That is the question
Here’s a very good rule of thumb for check-raising (see Chapter 10)
on the turn: If you think your opponent behind you will initially bet
and call your check-raise, you should check. If not, you should
bet — and do it right now!
Looking at a hand that’s good enough to check-raise, say Q-Q on a
rainbow 2-4-9-Q board (the best possible current hand), if you
check and your opponent checks, you’ve lost a bet.
If you check, your opponent bets, and you raise, your opponent
may well pass — check-raises tend to do that to people. And it’s
true that you gained two units (remembering that the bet on the
turn and the river is double what it is pre-flop and on the flop),
but you’ve also given your opponent a chance to simply check.
Your Q-Q may well have come with a pre-flop raise and a post-flop
bet. For sure, people want to see another free card — and if you
check, that’s exactly what they’ll get.
If you bet, people could call — in fact there is a whole classification
of people who will call — but won’t make a bet if you check to
them (for example, someone holding a tail-wagging K-9).
Made flushes: The notable exception
A flush is a big powerful hand that, if you’re lucky, has been made by
the turn. (Dang. You are so lucky. It seems like you always do that.)
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
78

Treat these hands as described in the “To check-raise or bet: That is
the question” section, but with one big exception: If you have a tiny
flush that is potentially threatened by a larger four-flush held by
someone to act behind you, you need to bet it now. Think of it just
like doing business at your local newsstand: absolutely no checks,
cash only.
Consider, for example, that you’re holding J 10 in eighth posi-
tion, but the other two people still in the game are behind you in
the ninth and tenth seats. You’re the first to act and the board
shows 4 7 Q 2.
This is a great setup because you hold a club flush right now and
it’s possible that either person behind you (one of whom opened
the betting on the flop) hit a pair of Queens. Unless the player
drawing with a pair of Queens has another pair to go with it (or
holds the Queen of clubs), he’ll be drawing dead here. And even if
he does have two pair, he still has to pair one of the board cards to
make a full house on the river.
The lurking danger is a person holding something higher than your
Jack still being in the hand. The Queen, King, and Ace, to the best
of your knowledge, are all still in play — and those are precisely the
kinds of cards people hold and play (especially if someone paired a
Q in his hand with the one on the flop).
Betting your hand right now will force anyone on the draw to
decide if the pot odds (see Chapter 12) are such that a call is feasi-
ble. Your betting leaves lots of room for other players to make 
mistakes:
 They may make a mistake calculating pot odds and fold when
they should call (or do the equivalent of making a mistake by
not knowing what pot odds are and simply making the wrong
choice to begin with).
 They may make a mistake calculating pot odds and call when
they should fold. (Again, they may not know and may just
make the wrong choice.)
 They may try to bluff you by reraising right now with a hand
that’s drawing dead.
If you do get raised when you bet a made flush, you should call and
check-call on the river. It’s possible someone is trying to bluff you;
if so, you’ll beat that person on the river. It’s also possible some-
one is holding a larger flush than yours (for example, K Q), in
which case you’re just unlucky — but you need to minimize your
losses by not firing the first bullet on the river.
Chapter 6: Taking Your Turn 79

And, of course, the smaller your flush is (like holding a suited 2-3 —
shame on you!), the more dangerous the four-flush on the river is.
In No-Limit, because so much more of your stack is at risk, you
need to be more careful and really consider the types of hands
your opponents have been playing behind you, as well as their 
pre-flop action:
 Suited Aces will probably have raises associated with them,
as will a suited King-Queen. Back off and check-call any bet
made on the turn and river.
 Other suited Kings and Queens are less clear and may well not
have pre-flop raises. Your best action here is to bet enough so
that a person on the draw doesn’t get pot odds and stick it
out for the river draw, but you need to be ready for beats.
 If you have a notorious slow-player (Chapter 10) behind you,
you should check through and call any bet that is made on
both the turn and the river.
 If you have a big-time bluffer playing behind you, check. If
they bet on the turn, push all-in (don’t call and then push on
the river — this gives them a chance to see the river card
before they decide). If they don’t bet, wait for fifth street:
• If it’s a club, check and call any bet made.
• If it’s not a club, place a minimum bet to induce a bluff
there. Reraise heftily, all the way up to all-in, if he acts
behind you.
Watching for “hidden” 
improvements
On the turn, you need to keep your eyes open for opportunities
that are making your hand better in ways that you didn’t expect.
For example, if you were dealt 10 10, a Q 8 3, flop isn’t
very exciting. As long as no one seems overly perky to see that
Queen hit, and there seem to be a lot of stragglers, you’ve got good
reason to be here for the turn card.
But when the J turn hits, things are both better and worse. You
now have a fairly good flush draw. Because the Jack and the Queen
are both exposed, the only clubs over your 10 are the King and the
Ace. You also have a gut shot straight draw of any 9 (with the 9
being your beyond-magical straight-flush draw — worth mention-
ing for novelty only, but not likely enough to change your mind in
the overall scheme of things).
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
80

This means there are
 Nine clubs left in the deck that will make your flush. This wins
as long as there isn’t one of the three bigger clubs sitting at
the table.
 Three more 9s left (we already counted the 9 above). This
will be good enough to win as long as you’re not fighting a
flush already on the table, or a stray K-9 that is barking up a
straight (except for the super-great 9 that’s an automatic
winner).
 Two 10s left in the deck. This is probably good enough as long
as someone isn’t playing a 9-10 for a straight (fairly unlikely
because that means all 10s from the deck would have to be in
play, and that last 10 would have to be paired with a 9, and
someone would have had to play it). Not impossible, just very
unlikely.
Assuming your pair of 10s isn’t any good right now (and it almost
certainly is not if there are a lot of players — there’s both a Queen
and a Jack on the board), that means you have 14 outs in the
46 remaining cards (not all guaranteed winners — depending on
the composition of other players’ hands; see Chapter 12 for more)
on the draw.
This hand isn’t good enough to bet straight-out, especially against
a bunch of players — but if you’re getting better than 31⁄4-to-1 pot
odds (see Chapter 12) on your call, you can stay in to see the river.
Keep in mind that the odds are against you in this situation — this
means you probably will lose the hand, but mathematically you’ll
win money in the long run if you call here.
If you see betting and raising in this situation before the action
even gets to you, you should fold. It almost certainly means you’re
either drawing dead or you’re under-drawing (meaning that the
same card that helps you also helps someone else who will end up
better — say someone holding a higher club).
Keeping Track of the Action
The most important job you have on the turn is to remember the
betting action you see on this round and try the best you can to
equate it with the actions you saw on the hole cards and the flop.
You also need to etch all the betting plays you see here into your
mind. The number-one most common place for players to set a
trap is on the turn — because they just miss a hand on the flop and
then make it on fourth street.
Chapter 6: Taking Your Turn 81

If you saw someone attacking a pot earlier, and then backing off on
the turn, it’s likely one of two things has happened: They’ve either
hit a hand, or they’ve missed and they’re trying to save some cash.
Determining a hit
Many people will anticipate a straight or a flush draw by betting —
beginning players will oftentimes raise. When they hit a hand,
they’ll often back off, hoping to check-raise you.
Trapping opponents who flush
Consider a flop of 2 5 10 with a turn of Q. Big hands in
early positions, like A K, will have raised pre-flop and may
have come out initiating betting on the flop (or maybe check-
raising). These players are sitting on a spade four-flush, with two
dominant over-cards. That is enough to make the eyes of many
players spin back in their heads and bet bet bet. When the other
spade hits on the turn, they suddenly see the riches of the world
on their doorstep and back off with the idea of check-raising you.
People in later positions like to play suited connectors, say 9 10,
and they too might get excited. Especially if they’re catching top pair
and a flush draw (also an example of a hidden improvement).
From a betting perspective, the event you’re looking for is a ton of
action, and then suddenly none. Again, it depends a lot on the play-
ers involved (see Chapter 8 for more on reading other players), but
all other things being equal, I’d say this person is setting a trap by
checking in front of you.
To test the theory, your best bet is to check through on the turn
and see what happens on the river. If your opponent comes out
betting on the river first again, she probably has a hand and was
trying to trap you. If she checks again, it means that she had some-
thing good (trip 5s, trip 10s, two pair?), but backed off when the
spades hit the board because she thought she was bested.
Of course, if you have the best hand (like the nut flush on the turn),
then absolutely you should fire a bet off — especially if you’re in
the end of the betting order.
Putting you in a straightjacket
The other hand that gets made in the same fashion is a straight.
Again, consider your opponents and their position around the
table.
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
82

If someone very commonly plays connectors, or suited connectors,
watch out for the player who limps in pre-flop, then gets excited by
a set of cards like 5 6 10, but suddenly backs off on a 9 turn.
If you think about it, that kind of behavior doesn’t make sense,
because a 9 isn’t a threatening card here. If someone had a hand
they liked with a 4-5-10 board, how is a 9 going to make it any worse?
Easy. Either that person was bluffing, and has now backed off
because he’s afraid you’re going to call again or, more likely with
many opponents, because his 7-8 just went straight. Now, instead
of bullying you with raises and hoping you might fold on semi-
bluffs, he can back off because he has a made hand.
Comprehending the miss
Don’t get so wrapped up in your inner psychic powers of analysis
that the turban falls over your eyes and blinds you to the obvious
signs that someone is afraid he’s just been bested, or he’s missing
on a draw he was hoping for before.
Smelling someone’s fear
For example, consider a flop of Q 2 4, and someone’s betting
strong. The A hits on the turn and your adversary seems to back
off. It’s not because she just made a wheel, it’s probably because
she had paired the Queens and is now afraid that the Ace has
counterfeited her in someone else’s hand.
Although it’s a fairly rare occurrence, another place you’ll see
people back off is when their trips have just been bested by a
better set.
Here’s an example that’s easy to see: Nearly everyone who holds
a suited K-Q pre-flop (some will bet it heavily). If a raising battle
ensues, it’s nearly always someone who is holding an Ace with a big
kicker (say a suited A-Q). Lesser pairs on the table will eventually
back off — they just assume that there is a bigger pair over them.
A flop of A-K-K will bring heavy action from the player holding
three Kings, and the player with the Aces will back off a tad (but
almost certainly still stay in the hand) assuming that the other
player is maybe holding a King, and only vaguely considering that
his opponent really does hold the nightmarish trip Kings.
Chapter 6: Taking Your Turn 83

A turn of an Ace will bring the player with the K-Q to a screeching
stop. It’s true, he now holds Kings full of Aces; but any opponent
holding even a singelton Ace now has Aces full of Kings. So when
the man with the cowboys quits betting, he isn’t trapping, he’s
trying to figure out how he got so unlucky.
Gazing at the unfortunate
Big bets pre-flop and on the flop but then backed off on the turn
could also mean your opponent has been anticipating a straight or
flush and has missed — or he was trying to bluff that he had hit
early, and he’s afraid that the bluff isn’t working because it was you
who had actually hit the hand when you called.
These types of boards will have slightly different looks. What
you’re looking for are single-suited flops, say 2 4 J followed
by an 8.
The siblings to the flush-not-making-it board are the ones where
the flops that had hinted and teased at a straight are now walking
away from making those wanting hands successful. Q J 3
followed by a lame 4, would be one example.
In the cases of straights and flushes that are not coming to fruition,
if you have a hand (even a medium-strength one) you need to fire
bullets. When someone folds, you automatically win — everyone
else should always pay to see cards they’re drawing for.

 Keeping an eye out
T
he river is where your poker hand, both literally, and figura-
tively, all goes down. Good luck! I hope you win — unless
you’re playing against me, in which case I hope you barely lose.
And you better believe I’ll be sincere in my sympathy. Really, I will.
Final Betting
From a pure theory point of view, the river card is very different
from all the others in that your hand is determined. The card dis-
tribution is over and now it’s just a matter of figuring out who has
the best hand.
Well, almost. There is this little final betting detail left.
Fifth street is probably most akin to pre-flop action, in that it’s the
place where occasionally you’ll see the bets really stack up. The
variations mean that the river can take on a few different betting
personalities, ranging from a nice quiet beer float trip, to a life
threatening white-knuckle shoot through Class IV rapids.
All-checking, no dancing
Usually rivers are checked all the way around for one of three
reasons:

 The board is threatening (for example, five hearts or a full
house is showing).
 Extreme betting early on has caused people to back off
(especially if the draws people were shooting for didn’t
come through).
 Players’ hole cards just missed the community cards entirely.
(This is especially common when it’s only the blinds that were
left in the hand.)
If you’re in a later betting position and everyone is checking, this
can be a very good time to pick up a pot. In fact, your ability to
pick up the stray pot in these situations may very well make the
difference between being a winning and losing player. If you con-
sider the action you’ve seen in the hand up until now and take into
account the types of opponents that are still in the hand (as you’ve
decided, using the super-clever Chapter 8), you can then decide
whether to check or bet in the following circumstances:
 If there was heavy action and raising surrounding a flop with
two of the same suit (say, J 8 3), but things have since
cooled off, you may well be looking at a broken flush. Fire a
bet out if you have a pair that matches the middle rank of the
community cards or higher.
 If the only people in the hand are the blinds, make a bet if you
have any pair.
 If someone has been betting heavily up to this point but sud-
denly backs away from betting on the river, they probably will
not check-raise you (this is much more of an expert play), and
instead have been bluffing by over-betting. Make a bet if you
have middle pair or better; or you believe there is a better
than 50/50 chance your opponent will fold.
 If all else fails, or if you get flustered, or if you’re just filled
with doubt, check. It doesn’t cost you anything.
Walking through the firestorm
Sometimes the river is the place where people sort of go insane
and just start hurling bets at each other. You only want to get
mixed up in this madness if you either have the nut (maybe second
nut) hand, or the player you’re up against is known to be looser
than a broken jar of pennies in the bed of a pickup truck on a
gravel road.
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
86

The most important thing you can do in this situation is make sure
you’re reading the board correctly (see Chapter 2). Make sure
you’re not getting caught up in a situation where your good hand is
blinding you to bigger possibilities. Because pots can grind up so
high over the course of a hand, one mistake here can wipe out an
entire week’s (or more) worth of poker winnings. Here are but a
few examples that I’ve seen people self-destruct on:
 You’ve hit the nut flush on a board of 10 10 9 6 2
with A 9. Started off pretty good with two pair, and then
you runner-runnered into the nut flush. Don’t get so wrapped
up with your flush that you ignore the full house possibilities
here. A common starting hand, especially from late position,
is 9-10. Likewise, anyone tripping his pocket 2s, 6s, or 9s is sit-
ting full. For sure you should call any bets, but don’t raise and
reraise. If people seem really eager to move any money into
the pot, just call.
 You trip on the board, holding a singleton. For example, the
board is Q K K 7 6 and you’re holding K J. Yes,
you’ve got trip kings, but anyone who’s tripped up with a pair
(Q-Q, 7-7, 6-6), now has a full house. A good friend of mine had
this exact hand happen to him the other day, when to his all-
in dismay, his opponent was holding Q-Q. My pal even went so
far as to call it a “bad beat” — it’s not because his hand was
never ahead at any point; that is hand myopia.
 You play into a gapped straight like so: You hold Q-9 and the
board shows K-J-10-2-4. The good news is you’re holding a
King-high straight. The bad news is A-Q is a bigger straight
than yours. Good slow-players love these kinds of set-ups. For
some reason, the gapped straights are easier to be fooled by
than holding 6-7 with a board of 10-9-8, I guess because it’s so
obvious there’s another possibility (J-Q) on top.
Yes, you might look at these hands right now and say, “Yeah, yeah,
whatever,” quickly blowing off the advice I’m giving. Unfortunately
in the passion of betting — especially big betting — when you
have a hand that’s made, it becomes remarkably easy to overlook
another (better) hand. And if you do overlook another hand, you
will not only pay, but pay dearly.
The telltale sign on No-Limit games on the river is if someone
raises you the minimal amount, instead of pushing all-in, and
(especially) if she does it again when reraised. What’s happening
here is the other player knows she has the nut hand and she’s
trying to maximize her return on the hand — she’s afraid that if
she pushes all-in, she’ll lose equity in the hand by your folding.
Chapter 7: Dipping in the River 87

Betting in moderation
The most common thing to see on the river is a bet, maybe two,
with people deciding if they’re going to call. If a bet has been made
in front of a player deciding to act, unless he’s one of the world’s
great actors, what he’s always doing is looking at the board and
answering the following questions, probably in order:
 What was the betting pattern of the person who placed the
initial bet throughout the hand?
 How does the pattern apply to the position of that player rela-
tive to the dealer (the cards the bettor would have started
with) and the cards I see on the board?
 What kind of player am I up against? Loose, tight, aggressive?
 Can the hand I’m holding right now beat the hand I think this
person has?
These are the steps you should be going through as well, but the
reason I talk about watching someone else do them is it can give
you a very good feel for the strength of her hand as she makes the
decision. For some reason, even very top players will drop their
emotionless facade on fifth street, sometimes even if there are
players still to act behind them. And if you’re acting even later
than the person considering, you have the ability to make an even
better read on the overall power of your hand.
As a general rule, it takes a better hand to call than it does to make a
bet. The more people calling, the better your hand has to be to win.
Deciding if you’re being bluffed
A savvy player, especially if he’s aggressive, or if he senses weak-
ness in an opponent, will do exactly one thing when the river has
determined he has a crappy hand: Bet. That is the only possible
way to save the money that he’s already put in the pot.
You now know this. The catch, of course, is that the person betting
will also bet when he has a hand. So how do you know which is
which? Again, the most important thing is to consider the player
and ask yourself the following questions:
 Is this person prone to bluffing?
 How long has it been since this guy bluffed and does it seem
like it’s time again?
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
88

 Is there something very clearly wrong on the board or the
cards that would hint at a bluff (like two cards to a flush or a
straight that never materialized, or possibly a low-ball board
such that someone holding two large pocket cards would
never have paired)?
Even if you’ve determined that you believe your opponent is bluff-
ing, you still have to be able to beat his “non”-hand. Any reasonable
pair should be plenty.
The generally accepted rule is that you should look at the pot odds
of your call. If there’s $36 in the pot, and it costs you $6 to call, you
can ask yourself if you think there’s better than a one-in-six chance
that you’re being bluffed, and if so, call. And whatever you do,
make sure to keep track whether you were right or wrong against
that player. Because even when you guess wrong, there may well
be something in what happened that will keep you from making
that mistake again.
Showing a Hand . . . or Not?
After the betting round of the river — even if there’s no betting and
all everyone has done is the boring action of “check” — there’s still
the showdown. It’s that heart dropping moment when people
expose their cards.
It’s not unusual, especially in games where tensions are running
high, for players to be overly reticent to show a hand — even when
it’s nothing more than a showdown. People are so protective of
their hands that they don’t even show them when they’re sup-
posed to. It’s also not usual when this happens for dealers to say
something smarmy like, “First hand over wins.”
There is, however, a progression that is followed if the whole table
suddenly gets deadlocked with the heavy task of just turning their
friggin’ cards over.
1. Technically, the person who made the last raise (or initial
bet, if there were no raises) is the person being called, so
he exposes his hand first.
2. The dealer displays this hand to the center of the table and
calls out what it is — for example, “Two-pair, 3s and 2s.”
At least the dealer is supposed to do this — he doesn’t
always.
Chapter 7: Dipping in the River 89

3. In a clockwise fashion, every player either shows or
mucks his hand.
Any hand that is mucked, without being shown, is officially
dead and no longer eligible to win the pot.
• If the newly exposed hand is beaten, the dealer turns
it face down and mucks it, moving to the next hand.
• If the hand exposed beats the first hand shown, the
newly exposed hand is moved to the center of the
table and declared — for example, “Three 3s.” The
original hand that was shown is then turned face
down and mucked.
4. The process continues until one hand is left face up on
the table (or multiples if there is a tie), the dealer pushes
the pot to the winning player, and the hand is mucked.
If there are any side pots (see Chapter 2), a winner is determined for
those first, working all the way back to the winner of the main pot.
During the showdown, you’ll want to keep in mind the following:
 Unlike the rest of a poker game, you do not have to expose
your cards in order (unless no one else is showing, in which
case you must when it’s your turn). If you think you have a
winner, you can turn it over immediately.
 Be sure to keep your cards in front of you. Don’t send them
sailing out into the middle of the table (it’s also bad form to
chuck them in your opponent’s face). You need to be able to
easily prove the hand is yours.
 You must expose both of your cards.
 Even if you’re heads-up and the other player immediately
mucks her hand but has gone all the way to the showdown
on the river, you still must expose your hand.
 You might have the rights to see another player’s hand if
he’s made it all the way to the showdown. At some card
houses, you must have a hand all the way to the showdown
yourself to be able to ask and see it; at others, you merely
have to have been dealt a hand. Ask your dealer what the
house policy is. Strangely, asking to see the other player’s
hand is always considered to be a mildly socially unaccept-
able thing to do in a professional card room. (I have no idea
why and it most certainly has never stopped me.)
 The most important rule: Never believe a player has the
hand he orally declares until you see it with your own eyes.
Every day someone, somewhere, misreads his hand. And this
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
90

is cutting your opponent slack, assuming you’re not dealing
with someone who has sinister intent.
 After you muck your hand, the hand is dead. Be certain you
have a loser before you throw it away, or just let the dealer
handle it for you.
 Do not begin to scoop the pot toward yourself. Let the dealer
make the first motion.
In general, I don’t like to expose any hand that I’m not forced to
show, but I also like my poker games to move right along. Here’s
my quick list of how I behave at showdown:
 If I think I have a winner, or if I was the person who started the
last betting round, I turn my cards over immediately.
 If someone else shows a hand that beats mine, typically I just
muck.
 I only show a hand if there was a hideous beat involved and
even then I do it only if I think it will give another player an
impression that I play extremely tight.
 If players are being slow to show hands, I just go ahead and
show mine to move things along.
If you have a hand that has been declared a winner and you ask to
see an opponent’s hand that is headed for the muck, you’re techni-
cally at a minor amount of risk. Because you’ve requested to see it,
and you have a hand that has been declared a “winner,” the hand
you’re asking to see is still considered to be live. If the hand that
was going to be mucked beats yours, you lose the pot. Dealers will
yap on and on about how dangerous and foolhardy this move is,
and I’m sure it can happen, but in two decades of professional card
room play, I’ve never seen a winner come back out of the muck —
not on my table, not on any table around me.
People don’t throw away winning hands — just be aware that it
could happen. Oh yeah, and I highly recommend not asking to see
hands of really drunk people.
If you make it to the river and no one calls your final bet, don’t
show your hand unless:
 You’re convinced it will change (or enforce) an impression
that you want to give other players about yourself, whatever
that may be (you play tight, you play loose, you were bluffing,
you weren’t bluffing, and so on).
 There is a potential prize associated with it, such as a high
hand. (See Chapter 16 for more on these.)
Chapter 7: Dipping in the River 91

Watching for Mistakes
Because the river is the place where the payouts happen, and it’s
the final stop of the (potentially crazy) train ride that this hand has
represented, you need to really keep your eyes peeled for any last-
minute weirdness that can happen. Although it’s true that profes-
sional card rooms are required by their gaming laws to keep things
on the up-and-up, mistakes can (and surprisingly often do) happen.
Of all the people in a card room, you are the only person who has
your best interests at heart.
In all the cases mentioned in this section, if you see something
amiss, call the dealer’s attention to it. If the dealer is of no help,
ask for the floorperson. You don’t need to be an ass about it —
be friendly, but firm, and point out the discrepancy you see.
Things to watch for include
 Dealers who are raking too much: Rakes in most establish-
ments are posted on the tables themselves and capped at
some amount. If you see a dealer taking more than the permis-
sible rake, call him on it.
 Not being paid for your winning hand: If you have the win-
ning hand, be sure you’re being paid for it. The most common
thing dealers overlook is a counterfeit of this type: You hold
A-Q, your opponent holds 8-8, and the board is K-K-9-9-3. You
win with two pair, Kings, and 9s with an Ace kicker; your
opponent has Kings and 9s with an 8 kicker. (Another is when
you hit a straight flush and your opponent holds the Ace-high
flush. Something like 4 4 versus A K with a board of
J 8 6 5 7.)
Part II: Texas Hold’em: Play by Play 
92
All mucked up online
In the online world (see Chapter 15), the showing of cards is a wholly automated
process, including “auto-muck” check boxes that throw your cards in if they aren’t
winners. Just like everything else about the online world, it just speeds things right
on along.
If you want to show a hand, make sure to turn the auto-muck check box off. At the
end of the hand you’ll be offered a chance to show.
Also if anyone has gone all the way to a showdown and then mucked a hand, you
can see what those player’s cards were through the “hand history” function of your
poker site. Use your site’s “help” function to find out more about how to do that.

 Other players stacking your chips: In a professional card
room, don’t let other players help you stack your chips. You’d
be surprised how dexterous some people can be with their
palming of a chip. (In home games, it’s no big deal.)
 Exposing your hand before betting action is done: Be sure
that all betting action is completed before you expose your
hand. If you’re uncertain of the state of the action, ask your
dealer.
 Other players trying to get cards back from the muck: Make
sure players aren’t trying to retrieve cards from the muck.
I’ve seen this happen about two dozen times at tables I’ve
been at — once, unbelievably, a dealer was actually allowing it.
 Errors in huge tournaments: Extremely large tournaments,
such as the main event of the WSOP, tend to be more error
prone. This is partially because everyone — all the partici-
pants, including the dealers at the table — is nervous. It is
also due to the fact that, because large tourneys have to bring
in an unusual force of dealers from elsewhere, large tourneys
commonly use dealers who are off their normal work schedule
(or from a different card rooms entirely). Communications
with the dealers who are there tend to be “less than ideal.”
 When you win an all-in, you in fact win it all: In No-Limit, be
certain you have all chips of another player when you bust
them out (including any house chip they were using to protect
their cards). Ensure too that you have any paper currency
that was part of the betting.
 When you lose an all-in, you pay the proper amount: Also in
No-Limit, if you lose an all-in and you have more than your
opponent, be sure that you’re paying an amount equal to his
stack (and not just pushing all of yours over with no leftovers
for you).
 Flaws on the cards: If you see flaws on the cards — nicks,
folds, bends, or creases that make them stand out — point
them out to the dealer. It’s not very likely that people at your
table are intentionally marring the cards, but Aces do get an
unusual amount of wear and warp because of their impor-
tance relative to hole cards.

T
he most important aspects of Texas Hold’em are in
this section. If you’re serious about playing cards, you
need to study this section carefully. If you think of poker
as a low form of war (and you probably should), this
would be the armory where you gather your weapons.
You’ll ﬁnd a chapter dedicated to reading your opponents,
as well as one dedicated to keeping your opponents from
reading you. You’ll also ﬁnd a primer on blufﬁng, as well as
the mathematical know-how you need to be a statistically
successful player. The ﬁnal chapter of the section is the
most theoretically complex of the book and digs even
deeper into the game to consider “larger” strategies of
Texas Hold’em.

Playing the Players
In This Chapter

I
f you ask me to give you the single most important factor in
learning and playing poker, it has to be gaining the best possible
understanding of the people you’re playing against.
If there’s one chapter in this book you absolutely need to read and
fully digest, it’s this one. Think of this entire chapter as being cov-
ered with a huge Remember icon.
A common assumption made by people who are just learning
Hold’em is that it requires some high degree of mathematical skill.
The implication is that if you’re not a math genius, you don’t really
stand a chance at the tables. This misconception is further rein-
forced by TV shows giving you running percentages on hands as
they’re dealt and played (which also ignore little details like the
fact that the players have no idea what their opponents are hold-
ing, but you do — making the numbers nonsensical in a way).
Although the math part does have a bearing on your play (see
Chapter 12 for more on math), it is heavily overshadowed by just
knowing the traits of people you’re playing against.
If you can identify the traits of your opponents, and interpret the
way those traits are presented to you at the table, you’ve found the
master key to the game. Make no mistake about it, understanding
your opponents at the table is the most important aspect of poker.
Classifying Players
When you play against people on a poker table, to the best of
your ability you want to try to classify their play. Beginning and

intermediate players tend to think of players by general categories
of classification, I talk about those in this section here and that’s
certainly a great place to start. Eventually, though, you’ll want to
get to a point where you classify each and every player individually.
The more you can say about an individual player whom you’re com-
peting against, the more likely you are to beat her in the long run.
Aggressive versus passive players
In broad terms, many players tend to be either aggressive or pas-
sive in their play. Figuring out where your opponents are in the
passive-aggressive spectrum can help you not only win more when
you have a good hand, but also lose less when he does.
All aggression, all the time
Aggressive players are the easiest to pick out at a table. And by
this, I don’t necessarily mean they’re the ones who are most likely
to throw an empty beer bottle across the room when bad beat.
Aggression can certainly be well defined but you’ll feel aggression
as much as you actually see it, and the symptoms are fairly blatant.
Aggressive players tend to:
 Raise and reraise fairly often when they’re involved in the
betting action. Raising is what makes the aggressive players
easily identifiable because dealers will always announce
“raise,” and all eyes on the table immediately turn there.
 Play from their position more heavily. An aggressive player in
late position will raise even more often than her usual trigger-
happy self, based solely on her position (see Chapter 4 for
more on the importance of position).
 Start the betting rounds. When given a choice between check
and bet, an aggressive player usually bets.
 Check-raise. Check-raising is the second most aggressive act
you can do on a poker table (the most aggressive act is rerais-
ing). And check-raising is sneakier, because the original check
implied that the player didn’t have a poker hand — the raise
indicates very clearly that the person does.
 Be not at all intimidated by anyone at the table. Aggressive
players by their very nature are also more self-assured.
 Be less likely to fold a hand after they’re playing.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
98

 Be more experienced poker players. As a rough rule, people
become more aggressive the more comfortable they get with
the game. This is especially true of people who have read a lot
of poker theory books (they repeatedly hammer home the
importance of aggression at a table).
Those wimpy passive players
Passive players are a bit harder to spot at a table, mostly because
their lack of aggression makes them easy to overlook. These are
the players who:
 Call rather than raise. The passive player believes she has a
hand — she just isn’t interested in pushing it forward.
 Check instead of starting the betting.
 Have a greater tendency to fold the hands they’re playing.
 May seem intimidated by one or more players at the table —
or maybe even playing the game itself.
 Typically have less poker experience. For a passive player,
just the act of sitting at a table and betting is scary enough.
He doesn’t want the added tension of raising. His inexperience
also means that he hasn’t had any exposure to advanced
poker texts that recommend raising.
Deciding tight versus loose
In addition to aggressiveness, you should try to be making some
sort of determination of how loose your opponent’s play is.
Hearing the tight squeak
A player is considered to be tight if he plays an extremely limited
set of starting hands. The starting set of hands I outline in Chapter 4
would be just a tad on the tight side. And although you can’t see a
player’s starting hand very often, you do see how often he decides
to play a hand — and this in itself is a clue.
The starting set of hands I describe in Chapter 4 will have you 
playing somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of all hands 
(including when you have the blinds and get to play for free or at
a greatly reduced rate). If you see a player playing 1-in-5 hands or
less (especially over a long period of time, or several sessions),
you’re looking at a tight player.
Chapter 8: Playing the Players 99

Watching the loose rattle
Conversely, loose players will play a wide variety of starting hands,
and as result, you’ll see them in the pot more often. Any player
playing something like a third of her hands, or more, over a long
session would definitely be considered a loose player.
Combining your evaluations
The implication is that there are four different types of players, but
that’s true only from the very widest of standpoints. Again, as you
gain your poker experience, you’ll probably find yourself fine-tuning
your evaluations to each individual, but the following are a good set
of evaluations to begin with — along with some advice on how to
combat them effectively.
Battling aggressive/tight players
Playing against an aggressive/tight player is fairly simple. Because
he’s tight, he’ll play only the highest quality hands. When he does,
your response is fairly straightforward: Fold unless you have a
hand that is extremely good.
Tight players tend not to bluff much, so don’t be afraid to throw
away the occasional hand that’s only okay by your estimation. And
if you’re going to start aiming your hold cards at the trash can, the
earlier you can throw it away, the better — their raising and rerais-
ing will gnaw on your stack in a big way.
Playing a bit looser against a tight player will get you more small
pots (especially if you’re raising, where he tends to fold quickly
early on). But when you do play loosely against him you need to
be very quick to drop a hand when you see aggression coming
back at you.
Keep in mind that if a player thinks you’re bullying him on the
table, he will change his style of play — probably by loosening up
a little and getting even more aggressive.
Playing against aggressive/loose players
Aggressive/loose players may seem a bit scary when you first
come across them, but you’ll quickly learn to think of them as one
of the biggest assets to you on a poker table. The aggressive play
will bring money out on the table; the loose play will mean that it
just keeps on coming.
An aggressive loose player will have an interesting side-effect of
making the other players on the table loose and aggressive as well.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
100

And although you may be tempted to jump on the bandwagon
yourself, your wallet will like it better if you instead opt for tighter
and more passive play. Because your opponent is loose, if you play
tight, you’re more likely to win on any given hand (because you
have a better set of starting cards). Over time, you’ll take down
more pots and find your stack ratcheting right on up.
Don’t complain on the odd times you get a bad beat. Just think of it
as the tax of doing business with one of your best customers.
Skewering passive/loose players
On the surface you may think that a passive/loose player is a
rarity, but actually it’s probably the most common category that
beginning poker players fall into. These people are the ones who
play too many hands and then have no idea how to bet as the
hand progresses.
If the player seems passive enough to fold merely by someone else
being aggressive, that’s what you should do every time you enter a
pot. Her continual folding will float your bankroll pretty quickly.
Be careful, though, some beginning players never fold, which
means bluffing against them serves no purpose. Against these play-
ers you should instead tighten your play (so you’re only playing
higher-quality hands) and fire away unmercifully when you’re hold-
ing the good stuff.
Dealing with passive/tight players
Passive/tight players are an interesting anomaly because what they
will tend to do is stay in the hand when they have a winner, but not
bet it. These types of players won’t pad your bank account very
much, but they’re also easy to play against — just check through
whenever they’re in a hand.
Because he’s playing tight, he may well have a winner over your
hand, making betting mildly suicidal. However, you should bet if
he’s the passive kind of player who tends to fold.
Watching for the “unusual” play
There is one thing you need to watch for: any unusual play from a
player you believe you have classified correctly. Here are some
examples:
 If you see a raise from a normally passive player who never
raises, that means she has a hand. Unless you have some-
thing really good relative to the board you’re seeing, you
should fold.
Chapter 8: Playing the Players 101

 If a typically aggressive player who is normally Mr. Bet-Bet-
Bet suddenly checks, he’s either playing for a draw or
(probably more likely) trying to trap you. Only bet against a
player like this if you’re willing to call a reraise.
 If an extremely aggressive player ever check-calls you, it
almost certainly means she has a trapping hand. If it hap-
pens to you, you definitely should not bet the next time you
see action.
In No-Limit be especially careful of a player who flat-call the blinds
from early position, when the typical action you’ve been seeing
from her is raising pre-flop. This is a classic trick of someone hold-
ing a very large pocket pair (A-A or K-K). Don’t fall for it.
As you’re classifying players, try as best you can to get a read on
how their play changes according to position as well. As you can see
from the list of starting cards in Chapter 4, even a basic poker strat-
egy encourages you to play tighter in early position and looser in
the back. Keep your eyes out for people who violate this guideline in
either way — either looser in front (especially those who play Aces
with no kickers from early positions) or tighter in the back.
Looking for Tells
A tell is a hint that a player gives you as to what the strength of his
hand may be — either through the way he bets, or the way he
physically behaves around the table. Successfully interpreting the
tells of your opponents will make a huge difference in any given
session you have at a poker table.
Watching the right place 
at the right time
It almost goes without saying that in order to watch for tells in the
first place, you need to be watching people. This tends to be easi-
est to do when you’re not playing in a hand, but rather just sitting
back and taking it all in. Although the other players not in the hand
are watching television or reading the sports pages, you should be
keeping an eye on your opponents. See how they face each other
and how they react as they win or lose, bet or fold.
I find that I pick up more watching the table when I’m not involved
in the hand because I don’t have that evil mix of paranoia com-
bined with my undeserved poker-playing superiority that’s present
when it’s my money on the line.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
102

Also, you need to get out of the habit of immediately looking at your
cards as soon as they’re dealt, as well as the community cards as
they’re exposed. Instead you should watch the players around the
table and see how they react as they see the cards for the first time.
(By waiting until it’s your turn to look at your hole cards, you also
avoid creating a tell on yourself — see Chapter 9 for more.)
Who’s acting and who isn’t?
Of course people know you’re looking for a tell and will intention-
ally try to throw you off. What you need to figure out, then, is who
is actually inadvertently showing a tell and who is merely trying to
make your poker experience even more confusing. (As you read
through this section, remember that all these things apply to you
as well — read Chapter 9 for more on not exposing your own tells.)
The number-one rule of tells
Because people associate bluffing with lying, they tend to interpret
that as meaning you should act in the opposite manner to what
people would expect. And this is the biggest tell of all, especially in
beginning-to-intermediate play: Players will most often intentionally
act as though their hands are the opposite of what they are.
A player who is bluffing will bet in a very aggressive fashion and
stare you right in the eyes. A player with a strong hand will casu-
ally lay a bet and look away. This tends to be especially true of
players who have cut their Hold’em teeth on the Internet — they
may have thousands of hours of play, but they’ve never sat in front
of another human being to do it. They have no idea how to act.
A whole lotta shakin’ goin’ on
Another thing to keep a close eye out for is someone who is physi-
cally shaking as she goes to place a bet. I’ve seen many beginning
players assume that this means a player is bluffing, and nothing
could be farther from the truth. A shaking player always is holding
a good starting hand or has made a big hand on the board — it’s
nearly impossible to fake the nervous rattle of someone with a
great hand. When you see it, it’s the real thing, and you’re in trou-
ble. Fold and ask questions later.
Watching other people’s hands
There is so much surveillance and counter-surveillance in the
world of tells — especially if you’re playing against more experi-
enced players — that I find it difficult to get a truly accurate read
on the players involved. Did I really just catch something, or are
they faking it? Hmm.
Chapter 8: Playing the Players 103

There does, however, seem to be one fairly reliable version of a tell
and that is how people use their hands at the table. I don’t mean
hand as in the two cards they’re holding, but rather hands as in
that part of the human body that is attached to a wrist — those
funny looking things that have five fingers on them.
Shaking hands typically indicate a crushing hand, but you can pick
up a surprisingly larger amount of information from watching
people’s hands:
 Many people will hold their cards in a certain way (for
them) if they’re planning on folding a hand. This gives you a
chance to look behind you on any given betting action to see
how many callers you might get.
 People thinking of betting will often fondle their chips
before it is their turn to bet. Many intermediate players do
this to make you think they’re either going to bet or call, in an
effort to get you to not bet because they would actually fold
otherwise — yet another version of acting in a way that’s
opposite of how they’re actually thinking).
 People who suddenly hit big hands, especially on the flop,
will often flinch with their hands.
 People who recheck their hole cards after an all-suited flop
(for example, all spades) were not holding two spades to
begin with or they wouldn’t be rechecking.
 People who check their hole cards twice pre-flop (or give
their hole cards an exceedingly long stare) often have a
very big pair. For some reason, people with large pocket
pairs need to look at them again — I guess they just want to
make sure they aren’t running away somewhere.
 One signal for checking is to tap the table when it’s your
turn to bet; some people, as hard as this is to believe, will
tap it one way for a true check (say with just an index
finger), but do another (say, rap the table with a fist) if they
intend on check-raising.
 In No-Limit, players who are becoming short stacked will
often count out their stack relative to the size of the blinds.
What they’re doing is figuring out how many big blinds their
stack represents, and on a surprising number of occasions
you’ll find these people pushing all-in soon afterward. Anytime
you see someone counting out a stack in such a fashion, you
should be leery of the all-in play behind you when you’re first
to act. Be sure to play tighter in these situations so you won’t
be afraid to call the raise.

Listening to what people say
You can find out quite a bit just by listening to people talking at the
table.
When people say the obvious
A couple years ago I was playing in Las Vegas, completely card dead,
and as I folded hand after hand I spent my time watching the players
for tells to keep myself from going even more insane. I found a few
here and there, like the guy up the table who would always put his
thumb on the lower-left corner of his cards before he folded.
But it took me a surprisingly long time to find the most obvious of
all: There was one guy who would, literally, announce his hand every
time the cards were exposed. He’d say things like, “Now I’ve got two
pair,” “I’m sittin’ on a big flush draw,” and so on. The most amazing
thing, though, was that everyone at the table was either ignoring
him or not believing him. Hand after hand he would announce his
way through and then take his opponents down on the river.
I thought it was nothing more than a funny freak occurrence, but
about a month later, I ran across yet another player who did the
same thing.
When you run across a player who’s decided to become the MC of
the poker table, your task becomes pretty easy: Hand him the micro-
phone and listen to what he says. On those rare times when you do
see his cards, see how they line up with what the player is saying.
It’s very possible that you’re hearing nothing more than some player
spewing static that he somehow finds “funny,” but you’ll find a sur-
prising number of times when it’s actually a tell (whether it’s lying
[which you then mentally reverse] or telling the truth).
Also when players show a big hand at a table to prove they weren’t
bluffing, it’s fairly common for others to chime in about what they
were playing. And while this isn’t 100 percent foolproof, the things
the other players say tend to be more accurate than not (because
those people don’t really gain anything by lying about the hands
that they folded). Keep track of what those players said they had,
what their relative position around the table was, and try to remem-
ber the way they acted as they went through the betting phases.
Listening to those who already know
Also keep an eye on how players who are very well acquainted
with each other, react to each other. For example, if you visit Las
Vegas in the off-season, it’s common to sit at a table with four
or five retirees who know each other. These people play often
Chapter 8: Playing the Players 105

enough, and know each other well enough, that it’s not unusual
for them to know (and often openly announce) the tells of all
their pals.
In these cases, if you see one player always backing away from
another in a given set of circumstances, you should start doing it
too. There’s no need to play against Lonnie for 20 years just to find
out that he always snorts when he has Big Slick — especially when
Big Sal has already done the investigation (and reporting) for you.
Keeping track of the mundane
Keeping track of mundane conversations that have nothing to do
with the card game you’re playing is a good idea. The way people
behave when they’re responding and reacting to the world around
them can be revealing.
For example, someone takes a sip of coffee and says, “This is the
best cup of coffee I’ve ever tasted!” If it is a great cup of coffee,
then you know what the person sounds like when she’s telling the
truth. You can watch her body posture and any other little detail
that seems relevant. Likewise, if the coffee is actually closer to
sludge, you’ve just seen how she reacts when she’s lying.
Don’t just take my word for it, Amarillo Slim Preston claims to have
won a world title by using exactly this kind of investigation.
Involuntary reactions
Many people have involuntary reactions to their play. I mention
hand shaking earlier in this chapter, but there are also things such
as sweating (people with big hands pre-flop tend to sweat) and
racing heart rates. Phil “The Unabomber” Laak plays with a
hooded sweatshirt, sometimes drawing it all the way up like Kenny
from South Park. Phil Hellmuth plays in a track suit with the collar
turned up. Both of them do this expressly so you can’t see their
veins pounding in their necks. (Note: I am assuming this isn’t just
something peculiar about people named Phil.)
When you watch for involuntary reactions from your opponents,
don’t forget to factor in the raw importance of the event you’re
seeing. Anyone making the final table of a major tournament will,
by default, be wound up tighter than usual.
In general, though, the more keyed up a person is, the more likely
he is to have a big hand.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
106

Failing all else . . .
You can sit and analyze and analyze your opponents and the situa-
tions you’re in, and if you’re not careful, you will overanalyze them.
If you find that you’re driving yourself bonkers and you’re not able
to get a proper read, you do have a couple more options.
Look at the hand positionally
If you find yourself getting overly confused with the situation, forget
trying to read your opponent for a tell. Instead consider her betting
pattern on this particular hand and how it could relate to starting
hands of different types. Consider nuances such as trips, flushes,
and straight draws. Don’t forget to factor in her actions on the hand
pre-flop and be certain to consider the player’s position at the table.
Trust your gut
The reason you’re able to live, breathe, eat, drink, and play poker
is because your ancestors made it through some pretty dark times.
They did this by fleeing from the big scary things that could eat
them and pounding on the little annoying things that were threat-
ening but beatable. These epic battles, fought over eons, ended up
putting you at a card table. And you still hold all these fight-or-
flight impulses. You should listen to them.
When all else fails, trust your instincts. If it just really feels like
you’re being trapped, you probably are. Fold.
If there’s just something basically wrong with that lady’s last big
bet — it just doesn’t feel right somehow — call it. This isn’t math
and it isn’t science — it’s instinct. Use it and you’ll be right more
than you’re wrong.
Just fold already
Okay, what started all this was that you were confused by the tells
you were seeing. Then you looked at the hand positionally and
couldn’t come up with any hints as to what that psycho on the
other side of the table might have. Then you wanted to try your
gut feeling, but the hot dog you had for lunch is burning a little too
much to get the right kind of read.
In cases like this, especially as you’re starting out, you should just
fold. Sure, you’ll lose some equity and occasionally be bluffed out
of a hand. But one bad fold costs you a lot less than a string of bad
calls (which is what happens if you’re chasing an opponent who’s
actually trapping you).
Chapter 8: Playing the Players 107

You can always fold now and just play the next hand. The cards
will be different there and you’ll have a whole new set of possibili-
ties. Don’t let your impatience with a hand — or especially your
current stack size — affect the quality of plays you’re making at a
table. If you think the quality of your play is suffering, take a break
and evaluate your situation. Figure out if you should buy in for
more or just call it quits for the day.
Zeroing In on Specifics
To really figure out a table, you should turn your beady little eye-
balls into laser beams and heavily home in on the table around
you. Here are a couple tricks you can use for help.
Figuring out the table in order
After a couple hours of play you should be able to mentally walk
around the table and talk about every player you’re playing against.
You don’t need to go into excruciating detail, but you should be
able to lay down generalities. A sample might look like this:
Seat 1: Aggressive player who raises pre-flop only in later posi-
tions with no previous callers.
Seat 2: Passive/tight player. Only calls when he thinks he has
the best hand.
Seat 3: Dangerous player. Varies betting sizes and styles. Hard
to figure out.
Seat 4: Was playing well early, but got a bad beat and is now
tilting.
Seat 5: Beautiful genius. (Oh, that’s right, this seat is you.)
Seat 6: Inexperienced player. Tends to fold when raised.
Seat 7: Only calls with good hands. Only raises with the nuts.
Seat 8: Very loose player. Calls nearly every hand pre-flop.
Almost never sees a turn card.
Seat 9: Uncertain. Player is either having a bad run of cards or
is playing far too tight.
Seat 10: Aggressive. Likes to take control of the betting action
every round.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
108

As you go through this mental list in your head, as much as you
can, make note of how the players interact with each other. For
example, the player who was bad beat in Seat 4 almost certainly
holds a grudge against the player who beat her. You want to make
sure you’re not interpreting something as a tell that is actually
some other type of interaction. That doesn’t mean that you can’t
exploit these types of situations to your benefit (you can and
should), but make sure you’re correct about the underlying reason
behind the actions you’re seeing.
Looking at individuals
By far the best way to figure out people at a table is to study them
individually. If you pick one person and watch him every hand,
through all of his moves — check, bet, call, fold, raise, win, lose, and
ordering something to eat — you’ll discover a tremendous amount.
Players expect to be watched when they’re involved in a hand or
farther down the line in the betting order. They aren’t expecting it
so much when their play is less consequential, and because of this
you’re more likely to see their true and/or real reactions to situa-
tions. You can use these real responses as a baseline to the other
behavior you see at the table in a hand.
Whenever I’m having trouble figuring out an individual player —
especially if I seem to be getting conflicting signals in recurring 
situations (like the way she behaves heads-up) — I drop every-
thing else and just spend time studying her.
When you do, don’t be belligerent about it, like giving her a contin-
ual icy stare-down. Instead, just make her a constant part of your
attention for a few orbits of the dealer button — you might even
try striking up a conversation. You’ll find your chances of figuring
her out will rise substantially.
After your next poker session, come back and read this chapter
again. It will give you deeper insight into the play you’ve just expe-
rienced and give one more reinforcement of the most valuable
thing you can learn about playing poker.

Bluffing: When Everything
Isn’t What It Appears to Be
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with bluffing
 Timing your bluff
 Targeting your bluff
 Semi-bluffing
 Surviving a failed bluff
W
hen people first become acquainted with poker, they run
quickly into the concept of bluffing — intentionally misrepre-
senting your hand in such a way that the other players are misled
as to what you have (usually to make the other players fold).
Aside from luck of the draw, bluffing is the element that elevates
poker from nearly all the other games of pure skill, such as chess.
To my mind, writing about bluffing is similar to writing about paint-
ing. Really the best way to actually do it is to go out and practice,
but it’s one heck of a lot easier to practice if you have at least a
rough idea of the underlying concepts. In this chapter, I walk you
through the hows, whens, and whys of bluffing.
Bluffing Basics
The most important thing in playing a poker hand is understanding
the players at the table. Bluffs depend almost entirely on how
other players will react to the information you’re going to pretend
to convey at the table.
Before you head any farther, make sure you have a basic under-
standing of Chapter 8 and what it means to play the other players
at the table — those concepts are the keys you need to under-
standing bluffs and making them work.

Your turn not to tell
In order for any bluff to work on your behalf, you first have to turn
off all the other tells you normally broadcast in a game. For exam-
ple, if you always riffle your poker chips on the table whenever you
have a marginal hand, people are going to be one heck of a lot less
likely to believe your big bet represents a good hand if you’re shuf-
fling your chips like a bored roulette dealer before you make it.
Of course, one of the problems of becoming overly stoic at the
table is that all your small, and otherwise usually not noticeable,
tells become much more pronounced. “Gee Mark, I never noticed
that you rub your fingertips together for one second whenever you
have a bad hand, but now that you don’t shuffle those chips any-
more it’s a whole lot more obvious.”
The best way to get a feel for the way you broadcast at a table is to
either videotape yourself playing cards with your friends in a home
game, or better yet, designate one of your pals as your poker
watchdog and have him give you a rundown on the way you act
and play. The only problem with assigning a watchdog is you
essentially eliminate playing that person for money for the rest of
your life — so if you do choose someone, it’s probably better to
pick the girl who beats you all the time rather than the guy who
helps subsidize your rent every month.
If you can’t shut off your emotional broadcasting system as you
play, you should at least be aware of what your tells are such that
you can mimic them in situations when you want to bluff.
When you first start playing poker, at least up through interme-
diate play, players will indicate the opposite of what they are.
It’s as though bluffing equates with “lying,” so people will act the
opposite — if their hands are weak they’ll act strong, if their hands
are strong they’ll act weak. Don’t fall into this same trap yourself.
If you’re not highly skilled, you’re better off conveying no expres-
sion than trying to misdirect someone with an “act.”
Don’t bluff people worse than you
Okay, okay, the title isn’t strictly true, but I’ve put it up there in
headline bold to make a point and have you think about it. Bluffing
people worse than you are, especially if they’re considerably worse
than you are, doesn’t always work the way you want it to.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
112

You’re more likely to run across the types of people I’m talking
about here early in your poker career. For some reason, they don’t
seem to end up playing the game for years on end. In the following
sections, I tell you why not to bluff them.
Some people might call anyway
The killing phrase you want to listen for at a poker table is, “I just
called to keep you honest.” If you ever hear someone say that at a
table, and you’re convinced it’s not a bigger part of some general
poker ruse, that’s a player you don’t want to bluff. Essentially what
he’s saying is, “You know what? I’m a bonehead. I’m so stupid I’ll
actually call you with a hand that can’t beat what you’re represent-
ing, and yes, I do believe you have it. I’m just going to give my
money away to you.” And instead, he beats you.
If you do run across a player like that, you can beat him, sure. But
the way to do it is to bet when you have a good hand, not a bad one.
Some people don’t understand what “lucky” means
Many beginning players don’t have a basic understanding of the
mathematics behind poker (see Chapter 12), and may go ahead
and call simply because they don’t understand what’s at stake.
For example, let’s say the board shows a rainbow K-K-8-2 and the
only hands you’ve shown all night have had Kings in them. You’re
sitting with A-Q in a No-Limit game and decide to push all-in to
feign a set of Kings. To your dismay, your opponent says, “I know
you have three Kings, but I’ve got pocket rockets here, and I’m
going to call and hope for that Ace.”
You’ve gone from having a person not understand what it means to
draw to only two outs, to a much larger problem of drawing dead
for all the marbles.
Assuming the river card wasn’t an Ace, if you had waited to make
this all-in bluff, you would have fared much better.
Now it’s true that you may not have any idea just how far gone
some of your “lesser” opponents may be, but if you’re patient and
let the game ride for a while, you’ll get some idea.
For opponents who seem too dull (or just too weird) to success-
fully bluff, you’re better off not relying on bluffing and instead
taking advantage of other types of errors they may make — like
playing too many hands or misjudging the relative strength of their
hands to the rest of the table.
Chapter 9: Bluffing: When Everything Isn’t What It Appears to Be 113

Making your bluff count
You only want to bluff where it matters, not where it doesn’t.
To look at an extreme example, if you’re sitting in the small blind
with 4-2 off-suit, in a No-Limit ring game and bet all-in to gobble up
the big blind, what have you proven?
If that player passes, you’ve won a single bet on the table by risk-
ing your entire stack. That’s the upside.
The downside is that you’ve mildly aggravated the player with the
big blind and, worse, you’ve drawn the attention of the table to
you. Everyone saw the play; everyone has marked you as a poten-
tial bluffer. Slow-players (see Chapter 10) love to eat players alive
who do that kind of stuff.
And if the player does call (slightly more likely than usual because
everyone else at the table has folded), you’re going to be behind in
the race.
You’re better off bluffing in situations in which:
 There are more chips in the pot (you actually get something if
you’re right).
 The bluff could make a difference in your tournament position/
standing (see Chapter 17 for more on tourneys).
 You have a reason to establish a stronger table image.
When to Bluff
One of the key elements to bluffing is knowing when to do it. If a
bluff is well timed, it will mean more to your stack and it’s more
likely to succeed.
Bluffing based on your image
of “predictability”
There are two polar-opposite philosophies about how opposing
players should view you as a player at the card table. One is to
have people think of you as an unknown-and-hard-to-classify
player, the other is to be thought of as being very predictable.
Both have their advantages and disadvantages.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
114

Playing the part of the wild man
The advantage of being an unpredictable player at a table is that
no one is sure what you have and what it means. Is he bluffing?
Is he just over-betting? Does he have something but wants us to
think he’s bluffing?
There is certainly a kind of satisfaction in being thought of as the
loose cannon at the poker table that can be had in few other ways
(aside from doing something like standing up in the middle of a
restaurant and starting to sing). The problem, however, is it will
cause people to just stick closer to their pure game, and possibly
think of your actions as static from the All Freak Network.
From a pure bluffing point of view, you’re better off conveying a
sense of predictability.
Playing the role of the predictable player
If you have a very predictable presence at the table — meaning
players are always fairly certain they think they know what you
have — a bluff is much easier to pull off.
To illustrate: If the only hands you’ve ever shown are very strong
opening hands (like those I talk about in Chapter 4), people will start
making predictions on what your hand is, based on the boards that
they’re seeing. Say a flop were to show a rainbow Q-J-10, someone
bet in an early position, and you raised from a middle position
(Chapter 4 also has more on the importance of position), you’d
probably get players spinning into this type of thinking: “Let’s see,
she called pre-flop and now I’m looking at that board. . . . She’s been
playing only tight hands and very conservatively. . . . She’s got some-
thing like a Broadway straight or trip Queens.” Even though you may
only have 7-7 for a pair lower than the board.
In fact, if someone does call a raise here, you’re almost certainly
behind and you need to see a 7 on the turn. Continuing to bet the
hand to anyone calling the flop-raise on the turn and the river is
probably suicidal, because if he’s good enough to call you early on,
he’ll be good enough to check-call you throughout the entirety of
the hand.
Looking at your hand 
from the outside
When you bluff, try to get inside your opponent’s head, or at least
take an objective view of the board. This can be harder than it
Chapter 9: Bluffing: When Everything Isn’t What It Appears to Be 115

sounds, because everyone has a natural bias toward his own play —
people tend to think of themselves as better players than they
actually are, and their opponents as worse than they actually are.
Boards that hint at the dangerous cards a player could be holding
make the best bluffing opportunities. Here are some examples of
“more bluffable” boards:
 Flush draws: A board with four clubs looks ominous. (More so
if you don’t actually hold any clubs in your hand, eh?) If you’re
up against only one other opponent, the chances are he doesn’t
have a club either. (If you’re up against two opponents, odds are
that one of them does.) You may want to take advantage of it.
 Straight draws: Any board showing a straight draw can be
scary. Something like 6-7-8-9 is even scarier if people see you
betting from a later position. If they know poker theory (or at
least have been paying attention), they’ll assume that you had
a lower-quality hand and are overlapping the cards they are
seeing.
 Hidden trips: Boards like 2-4-7 only get heavily bet one of two
ways: Either someone has a big over pair, like pocket Kings, or
someone has hit trips on the board. This bluff is harder to pull
off against beginning players than it is against intermediates.
 Overt trips: A-A-2 is the type of board that’s just screaming for
someone to have tripped up (especially because people love
to tag along into the game with Aces). Yet, half the Aces in the
deck are gone, so acting as though you have one can poten-
tially be a safer bet than it first appears.
You can never bluff a person who already has the best hand, or
worse, holds the hand you’re acting like you have. And you will run
across these players sooner or later. Accept that as a risk, under-
stand it will happen, and move on with your plans.
Bluffing in the right game
Some games are easier to bluff than others. In general Limit tends to
be a much more difficult game to bluff. It’s certainly not impossible,
but the amount that a person can bet at any one time (and, there-
fore, lose at any one time) is limited. Typically, bluffing in Limit
works best either in games with extremely advanced players or in
games with beginners that don’t fall into the “I never fold” category.
No-Limit is a much easier game to bluff because the stakes are
higher, so the penalty of a bad call is more crushing. Obviously, it
makes the bluffing risk that much higher, but that is both the
beauty and horror of No-Limit.

116

Chapter 9: Bluffing: When Everything Isn’t What It Appears to Be 117
The best bluff ever?
In my eyes, the best bluff in recent poker history came from Chris Moneymaker in
the final two of the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP).
Moneymaker had gone into heads-up play against Sammy Farah with a 2-to-1 lead
in chips, but over the course of the game he’d seen it erode to the point that they
were nearly even.
Moneymaker was dealt 4-7 of Spades with Farah being dealt a K-9. A flop of 2-9-6
with one Spade gave Farah top pair and Moneymaker nothing more than a lot of hope.
Farah made a large bet and Moneymaker (incorrectly) sensing weakness called.
The turn produced the 8, a card that was finally starting to make Moneymaker’s
hand look good, giving him a straight draw, a flush draw and a straight-flush draw.
But Farah was still leading, and all of Moneymaker’s plays were draws. Farah bet
and Moneymaker made a sizeable raise — essentially a semi-bluff (more on these
later in this chapter).
The river was the 3, a crushing card for Moneymaker. Sammy, with the winning
hand, checked and Moneymaker pushed all-in. This play is nothing more than a pure
bluff in a situation where Moneymaker knew he had to have the worst hand.
Farah sat and thought. Then he thought some more. Moneymaker’s play meant that
he would have to call with all his chips. He even felt something was funny about it,
saying, “You missed your flush, huh?” but got no response from the stonewalling
Moneymaker.
To Farah, it seemed like an amateur’s play. Make a big bluff in a situation where it was
obvious that the hand was broken. And yet, someone might make a play that looked
like an amateur’s play when he had a hand, intentionally to trip up the other player.
That turn card was suspicious. Why the big raise right there? Had Moneymaker hit trip
8s and was now trying to back Sam off a perceived straight or flush draw?
After several agonizing minutes, he finally decided to pass.
This ended up being the pivotal hand of final table. The pot let Moneymaker spring
back to being a 2-to-1 leader and he handily won the entire tournament a few short
hands later.
Later, Chris Moneymaker said he noticed that Sammy tended to call when people
answered his questions mid-hand. He figured that if he had answered, he would be
called. So he just shut up.
Whether Chris’s analysis is right or wrong, there’s no way you can argue the out-
come. It’s the highest stakes and most successful bluff so far in the 21st century.
You can bet there’ll be more.

Who to Bluff
Bluffing isn’t something you do in a vacuum; you need to have a
target. And the bigger and rounder you can paint that target, the
easier it is to hit.
Preying on weak personalities
If the concept of picking on people when they’re down just gener-
ally turns your stomach, poker may be a bad game for you. If
you’re not willing to just keep beating on an opponent — even
when he’s down — you better believe that that opponent is more
than willing to come back and pound more than a little on you after
he gets some footing.
Knowing weakness when you see it
Bluffing will always work the best on opponents who are willing to
drop a hand, or those who can somehow be convinced that it’s just
easier to let this hand go for now and fight for a better one later.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
118
Bluffing hands in the middle ground
Nearly all your successful bluffs will happen in the area I call “the middle ground.”
You can think of hands as being divided into three large categories:
 Good hands
 Bad hands
 In-between hands
When your opponent has a good hand, for the most part you’re not going to be able
to bluff her unless she thinks you have a great hand. So bluffing against a good hand
is either rare, impractical, or foolish.
When your opponent has a bad hand, all you’re really going to do is make her fold
faster. Although it’s true that semi-bluffs (later in this chapter) work against these
hands, for the most part if you’re even a little aggressive in your play, you’ll win these.
The in-between hands, however, are the middle ground where it all happens. You want
to be aware of, and probing for, the hands that your opponent has that she just isn’t
that committed to. Those are the hands you can bluff against no matter what you have,
because, quite simply, your opponent would rather let them go than fight with ’em.
Think about how you feel about an in-between hand. Now fight that insecurity in
your opponent.

The thing you want to look for in opponents are those who only
play with the absolute best of hands, or better still, those who only
call raises when they feel that they have something very close to
the best hand possible on the table. These are the people you need
to be turning your bluffing attention to because they will fold more
than they should.
Playing against those who show no weakness
You’ll run across people (especially early in your poker career)
who simply refuse to fold a hand. The underlying theory is that
they figure you’re a pathological liar and try to bluff every hand.
(Actually, it’s more likely that they just don’t want to be embar-
rassed by having been bluffed.)
If you run across these overly macho types, your best bet is to not
bluff at all (it’s not going to work because they won’t fold) and
instead only play hands of the highest quality. Unless you run into
that awkward situation where your good hand is beaten by their
great hand, you’ll actually win money more quickly off these folks
than you do off the ones you bluff.
Taking advantage of other situations
Bluffing may work to your advantage for other reasons. Those rea-
sons run the gamut, but here are a few:
 Some people, whether they win or lose, will set a definite
limit of how far down they’ll allow their chip stack to fall.
If you run across people with this proclivity, you can nearly
always bluff them when they’re getting close to whatever line
that they draw because they don’t want to cross a mental
boundary.
 It’s easier to bluff people who are preoccupied. If your oppo-
nent is taking a phone call from a nagging boyfriend (my editor
made me change the gender), playing at another table simulta-
neously online, watching the grill at your poker game, or get-
ting paged for dinner in the casino restaurant, it’s much easier
to convince her to let go of a hand with a big bet or raise.
 Chip leaders in tournaments can bully the smaller stacks.
This is especially true when you get near the bubble that
determines who will end up in the money and who won’t.
(See Chapter 17 for more on tournaments and strategies.)
 Bluffing is cheaper on the hole cards and flop than it is in
on the turn and river. It’s essentially half-price to bluff early
on and may gain you an early pot win, or as you can see in
Chapter 5, a free card.
Chapter 9: Bluffing: When Everything Isn’t What It Appears to Be 119

 Bluffing is easier with fewer players. As a rule of thumb you
want to be up against, at most, two other players when you
bluff — and being up against only one other player is a consid-
erably more favorable situation for you. Remember: When
you’re bluffing, you’re trying to get people with intermediate
hands to drop — if you try to push enough of them at one
time, one of them will not be pushed.
The Semi-Bluff
A semi-bluff is where you bet a hand a little bit stronger than you
should, or make a bet implying a hand is a bit better than it is.
Usually the hope and prayer behind a semi-bluff is that if someone
calls you, you have a decent chance of outdrawing your opponent.
I think of a semi-bluff like having a pit bull puppy with a deeper-
than-normal bark. It sounds evil enough that most people will stay
away. And for those who venture into the yard? Well, maybe it’ll
grow big enough that by the time my opponent opens the door to
my house, the dog can tear his leg off.
As I’m sure you can tell by the way I’m describing it, the semi-bluff
is one of my favorite plays in poker.
When to semi-bluff
The rules for semi-bluffing are nearly identical to those of regular
bluffing. The biggest difference is you’re going to be playing more
heavily with the concept of drawing with a semi-bluff (whereas a
full-on bluff tends to deal more with the community cards that are
already dealt).
Here’s an example: Imagine you have K 10 and the flop is Q
Q 9. You’re sitting in later position and someone bets in front
of you. A raise here is a semi-bluff. You don’t really have a hand yet
to speak of — just a straight draw, a flush draw, and a straight-flush
draw. The hidden beauty of a raise, however, is that it may make
people think you have trip Queens this instant and are trying to do
something like drive the flush draws away.
Here’s another example: Say you have A 3 playing from a late
position and the flop is a rainbow 9 5 3. That’s a truly anemic
and shaky flop — so much so that there’s a pretty good chance no
one’s going to touch it with his hole cards. A raise post-flop isn’t
that bad of play in and of itself, but considering that you can catch
an Ace, or have a freak shot at two running spades for a flush, a
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
120

raise there falls into the category of semi-bluff. (If you got a caller
here and then saw another spade on the turn, it’s probably worth
following it with yet another semi-bluff. Your opponent almost cer-
tainly would put you on trips at that point, because he wouldn’t
think you’d be crazy enough to play for a running spade flush.)
Obviously, people who are more likely to fold to a flat-out bluff are
also more likely to pass on a semi-bluff.
Why semi-bluff?
There are a couple of reasons to consider a semi-bluff:
 When someone folds, you get their money 100 percent of
the time. There are no bad beats, no lucky draws — you just
flat-out win. The more often you can make this happen on a
poker table, the better your game will do in the long run.
Semi-bluffing gives you chance at making that happen.
 Semi-bluffing is also a nice toe into the water of the bluffing
pool. It’s not a full-on bluff so you may not be as uncomfortable
about doing it (either consciously or unconsciously), because
you feel that you can actually make things better with a draw.
This comfort, in turn, may make the play seem more “natural”
to other players at the table and make them more likely to pass.
Getting this kind of emotional support and security over your
bluffing habits will do nothing but help your game.
 Semi-bluffing is harder for opponents to read and figure
out, even after they see your cards. Unless you’re playing in
a home game, and especially if the people around the table are
a little fatigued and the game has essentially dropped into
autopilot, what happened is often not totally clear. You may
get a mild taint as being either insane, or just a bad player, if
people can’t put rhyme or reason to it. But it’s not as if a repu-
tation like that is going to bother your game.
Getting Caught — Now What?
First of all, understand that you will get caught bluffing. It’s all a
part of the game. When you do, don’t freak out or let it rattle you.
Instead, it’s time, once again, to step outside yourself and try to see
the hand through your opponent’s eyes. This turns out to be consid-
erably less difficult than evaluating your pre-bluff strategy, because
oftentimes your opponent will just sit and start crowing at you at
length about how he just knew that you weren’t telling the truth and
that you never were a good bluffer and a whole bunch of other gib-
berish you’d rather not hear (but absolutely should listen to).
Chapter 9: Bluffing: When Everything Isn’t What It Appears to Be 121

The immediate thing that your bluff tells other players is that, yes,
you do in fact have the ability to bluff built into your character.
This knowledge may cause a few players to immediately, com-
pletely reevaluate your play on the chance they thought you just
weren’t even capable of it.
You’ll almost certainly be thought of as a looser player, no matter
how tight or loose they thought you were before. This means you’ll
be more even more likely to be called, so tighten up on the hands
you play a bit, but don’t be afraid to go ahead and bet aggressively.
Because players are more likely to call, you may well be able to
recoup what you’ve lost in just a few large bets.
It may also indicate to other players that you’re unable to read a
tell on another player at the table if she happened to have a mon-
ster hand and you sort of missed that in your frenzy of trying to
bluff against her. This, in turn, may cause the other players to be
not quite as guarded toward you in their plays (because, after all,
you’re an idiot if you couldn’t see that one coming) and you may
find you’re suddenly able to pick up much more information about
other players (especially when playing only one other player
heads-up in a pot).

Chapter 10
Maximizing Your Win:
Check-Raising and Trapping
In This Chapter
 Checking out check-raising
 Setting a trap
 Getting the most you can
I
n any investing situation, you want to maximize your wins and
minimize your losses. When you’ve hit a great hand (you lucky
dog, I can’t believe you did it again), your next trick is to figure out
how to make the most of it.
Check-Raising
A check-raise happens when you check in the betting action and
then raise any player that bets after you. A check-raise indicates
strength and always draws attention from even the most comatose
of opponents.
Bluffing on a check-raise . . .
When you check-raise, you’re automatically thought of as being
tricky and potentially dangerous.
. . . and getting caught
If you check-raise on a bluff, and you’re caught, you are immediately
colored with the “idiot” crayon from everyone’s box. Not necessar-
ily a bad thing, but it will force you to only play better hands the
next time you check-raise, because you’re more likely to get callers
in subsequent hands.

. . . and getting away with it
If you bluff and get away with it, it still ups your chances of being
called the next time, because everyone has that nagging doubt in
the back of their minds. “Did that guy really have a hand there, or
not?” And until you’ve played a fair amount of poker, the odds are
pretty high that you’re sending out some weird vibe when you’re
bluffing — people think you are, they’re just not willing to find 
out . . . yet.
Playing a good hand 
on a check-raise . . .
Until your skill increases quite a bit (and your opponents become
much more wary of you), you’re more likely to check-raise with a
good hand.
. . . but getting no callers
If you check-raise, but don’t get any callers you get a couple of
side-effects:
 The table becomes a bit more leery of you. When you check
in the future, people are less likely to bet behind you, especially
with a lesser hand, because they’re afraid you might be check-
raising again. (This also means that when people do bet behind
you in the future, they’re more likely to have a good hand.)
 People will wonder what you have and there will always be a
nagging feeling that you may have been bluffing. This makes
people more likely to call your check-raise in the future.
. . . and getting called
If you check-raise and get called, in many ways this is the best pos-
sible of all worlds, because in one short action you:
 Got to show off your nasty, yet perfectly groomed, monster
hand
 Proved to the table you weren’t bluffing
 Helped to establish a table image of being a nasty bruiser that
is not to be toyed with
 Got to line your pocketbook with extra cash
When the time seems right to check-raise, you absolutely should
do it, but in the back of your mind you should keep in mind that
check-raising and getting called is the most effective way to make
the whole process work.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
124

Considering a check-raise
There are a number of situations in which you may want to 
check-raise:
 You have top pair with top kicker on any board that is not
overly threatening otherwise.
 You have two pair.
 You have trips.
 You suspect your opponent is bluffing and by check-raising,
you might get him to fold.
 You have a good hand and think there’s a good chance you
can check, get a bet behind you, raise, and still get a call.
 You have a mediocre hand, but you believe that someone is
likely to act behind you, and then might fold if you raise.
Think about this particular bullet long and hard — this sce-
nario is usually not that likely.
Check-raising round by round
In the following sections, I walk you through each of the possible
places to check-raise.
Pre-flop
Uh, no. It can’t happen here. The blinds force you to call, raise, or
fold. There is no such thing as “check” pre-flop, which makes
check-raise, well, hard. Really hard. As in impossible.
After the flop
This is the first place you can check-raise. The biggest advantage
of doing it here is to thin the field if there are too many callers.
People with marginal hands who have called a bet behind you,
especially those in late positions, may well fold on a check-raise,
because they may not like the idea of playing for twice the stakes
on the turn and river.
Note: It’s very unlikely that you’ll get everyone to fold here. Unless
you have a table image of being someone who only plays super-
quality hands, almost anyone who bets behind you will call your
check-raise after the flop.
Having said that, if someone does call you on a flop check-raise
and you follow up by betting first on the turn, it’s much more likely
Chapter 10: Maximizing Your Win: Check-Raising and Trapping 125

that your opponents will fold. (Anyone who calls you when you
open betting on the turn has a very good hand, thinks you are
bluffing, or has pot odds on some draw she’s trying to make.)
Don’t forget that if you force a fold from an opponent on a check-
raise on the flop, you would have made more money if you’d
waited for the turn (but you also would have exposed yourself to
one more dangerous card).
After the turn
This is where check-raising starts working well, because the stakes
are doubled.
Your best rule of thumb on the turn is to check-raise only if you’re
likely to get a bet and a call behind you.
If you have a good hand, and you have much doubt as to whether
someone actually will bet behind you, you should just go ahead
and bet rather than check-raise.
After the river
Because this is the last betting round, only check-raise if you’re
fairly certain you’ll get a bet behind you and one of the following
is true:
 You have a great hand.
 You think that, if you check, your opponent will bet and then
also pass when you raise.
Trapping through Slow Play
Slow-playing is the half-brother of check-raising. A slow play is pos-
sible in any situation where you start off with a very good hand, but
don’t bet it hard in the early betting rounds in an effort to maximize
the total return on the hand.
Timing a slow play
Slow-playing works well in a couple of situations:
 When you’re at a table with several players who are very
aggressive: In these cases, all you have to do is sit back and
make what appear to be meager calls as everyone else bets,
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
126

raises, and carouses through the poker neighborhood. Doing
this keeps the quality of your hand camouflaged, as well as
the general focus of the table off you.
 When you’re so far ahead in a hand that it’s unlikely
another player will catch up: For example, if you were dealt
A 3 and the flop is K 7 2, you have the best possible
hand at that moment. The only hands that could potentially
beat you are the cases of someone flopping a set and then fol-
lowing that with a pair on the board (giving them a full house).
There’s also the super-fluke of drawing quads.
You should not slow-play in the following instances:
 You flop a big hand, but bigger hands are threatening. For
example, say you’re holding Q J and the flop is A K
10. The great news is that you have a Broadway straight. The
bad news is that there are several attacking hands possible: If
someone is holding two spades, she’s on a flush draw; it’s also
very possible that someone is holding two pair (especially if a
lot of players are still on the table), giving her immediate full
house draws. In cases such as these, you should just come out
firing. Anyone who wants to stick it out for either drawing her
flush, or her full house, should have to pay for the privilege.
 You’re playing a fairly passive player who is not likely to
bet. Remember: Your big hand is only worth money if some-
one actually bets against it.
 Your hand is big, but not that big. For example, if you’re
holding A 4 and the flop is A Q J, you have top pair,
but no kicker. Other people at the table are definitely holding
Queens or Jacks (there may even be another Ace sitting out
there) and your weak kicker is leaving you vulnerable. You
should just bet your hand now.
Slow playing works better in No-Limit than Limit because of your
potential to take down so much more money at the end. Also,
because the bets can be any size, you can wait until the river
to make your betting play. The bigger the hand, the longer you
should wait.
The Theory of Two and slow playing
All slow playing is governed by what I call the Theory of Two,
namely:
 To the best of your knowledge, is your opponent twice as
likely to bet as he is to check if you check first?
Chapter 10: Maximizing Your Win: Check-Raising and Trapping 127

 If you bet in front of your opponent, is he twice as likely to
call as he is to fold? This is especially important on the betting
rounds that happen before the river because each round repre-
sents an opportunity to help relieve your opponent of some of
his cash.
The act of slow-playing
Actually making the slow play is almost an art form in and of itself.
Think of it as another form of bluffing. What you’re trying to do is
make your opponent think that you’re calling his action with a
hand that is much worse than your own; or if necessary, placing a
bet that appears to be a bit more reluctant than you’d like.
Slow-playing usually involves check-calling, rather than check-
raising. When you do your check, you should make it fairly fast,
but without being suspicious. Your opponent will then bet and
when you go to call, you shouldn’t agonize over it for a long time
(this looks too much like you’re acting), but you also shouldn’t
call immediately. A rapid-fire check-call, especially on a beginning
and low-intermediate Hold’em table, is a sure sign of someone
trying to slow-play.
There is one exception to the don’t-overpause rule: If you’re calling
with many more people waiting to call behind you, it’s pretty easy
to act like you’re worried about them calling as well. When you
pause, make it a point to look at the players and/or their stacks
behind you. This “consideration” may also end up getting you a
few extra callers. (Remember, though, more callers also increase
the risk of your losing the hand.)
On intermediate tables (and up), you should try, as much as you
possibly can, to not pause if you’re first to act and you’ve hit a big
flop. That millisecond pause, where you’re gaining recognition of
what your hand is before checking, is a dead giveaway — and it’s
almost impossible to fake.
It’s very possible that if you check-call on the flop, when you check
on the turn you won’t get a bet behind you. (This is especially true
if you’re thought of as being a good player — or you’ve called a
large flop bet in No-Limit without raising.) If your opponents seem
to be cooling down their betting, make sure you put a bet out on
the river, even if it’s a small one — you don’t want to let that bet-
ting opportunity walk by.

128

Maximizing Your Returns
Getting a big hand is a rare enough occurrence that you really want
to milk every last cent possible out of it.
Deciding when to sit back
The decision of whether you bet a big hand or sit back is based on
a few factors:
 The aggressiveness of your opponent (see Chapter 8 for
more about understanding your opponents at the table):
The more aggressive your opponent is, the more you want to
lay back — especially in No-Limit. The less aggressive your
opponent, the more you’ll have to bet it along.
 The excitability of your opponent: There are many players,
especially at upper skill levels in No-Limit, who will not
become aggressive against an opponent who is checking, but
will act up if that same opponent bets a minimum amount.
To them, these little bets feel as though you’re trying to steal
a pot for cheap. Like a crazed pit bull, a little action is like the
smell of blood to them, and they can’t help but attack back.
If you’re a slow player, you learn to like these little doggies.
Rafting the river: Check or bet?
The Theory of Two has some implications on the river. I’m listing
these in the order you should consider them:
 If you are certain your opponent will check if you check, you
should absolutely bet. There is a whole category of mediocre
hands that some people will call with but would never bet
when checked to (like a medium pair versus your flush).
 If you think that betting in front of your opponents will
cause them to fold, and you have a great hand, you’re
better off checking to see if they’ll try to snatch a pot from
you. This has the added benefit of mildly confusing your
opponents because not all people (especially beginners) can
understand why someone would check first action on the
river with a great hand.
 In No-Limit, bet the maximum amount that you think your
opponent is twice as likely to call as they are to pass. If you
have absolutely no idea how much this amount might be,
make the minimum bet you’re allowed.

Camouflaging Your Play
and Dodging Traps
In This Chapter
 Creating an image for yourself
 Watching for trouble
A
fter even a little exposure to poker it becomes obvious that
you need to be fairly fast on your psychological feet to be
adept at the game. Like a well-executed battle, you need to be
stealthy as you attack and nimble when others start firing back
at you.
Setting Expectations
throughout a Game
There are many people who espouse keeping your opponents
guessing throughout a Hold’em session. The good thing about
general bewilderment at the table is obvious: People have no idea
what you’re playing. The bad news, however, is that if people don’t
know what you’re doing, or how you’re playing, they’re bound to
just play a bit tighter and then fire at you harder when they do
decide to play in the hand. These are some of the very hardest
people to beat.
Better, at least in the short and medium term of a game, is to pres-
ent an image at the table that is very predictable and defined to
the other players. After you do that, you can take advantage of the
expectations you set, because there is a difference between what
you appear to be and what you are.

Other people very rarely see your cards. All they’re aware of is
how many times you play your starting hole cards — if they see
you in a lot, especially over a long period of time, they’ll know
you’re loose. Aside from that, there isn’t much indication. You need
to concentrate on what they don’t know and help influence the
things they do.
Setting a style
Pick a style you’re happy with displaying, as well as that is easy for
you to portray, and then follow through with it.
Choosing a personality
Your choices are as different as there are personalities in a card
room. Here are but a few possibilities:
 Businessperson just playing cards to kill time while in town
 Crazed sports fan
 Hard-core poker student
 Half-interested player
Feel free to bring props along with you — crossword puzzles, mag-
azines, books, whatever. And don’t forget to dress the part as well.
If people think you aren’t completely absorbed in the game, you’re
setting a style and expectation from the other players that you can
take advantage of as the game progresses.
Showing a playing style
Just because you don’t have to show a hand doesn’t mean you can’t
go ahead and do it anyway every now and then to reinforce what-
ever you’re trying to convince people of at the table. So if you’re:
 The crazy person, make sure to show the occasional set of
bluff cards to your opponents. If you do this, though, be
warned that people are more likely to call you in the future.
This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you do need to be aware
of it.
 The super-tight player, show the occasional hand you
win when there are no other callers and you have a good
solid hand.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
132

 The player who will lay down a hand, if you want more
action pointed toward you in a poker game, show a hand to
the table before you fold it. (Make sure to do this only if
you’re up against one opponent, or you’re the last to act in a
given round — you don’t want to give a positional advantage
to people who have yet to act.)
When you show a hand, you’re removing all doubt about what your
betting actions were relative to the hand you held. People are
trying to figure out your tells, and because of this you should
engage in the behavior very sparingly.
Also, if all you ever show are good hands, you still should show
them only occasionally and not every time you have them. If you
show every good hand and never show any of your bad ones,
people will begin to figure it out. This, too, will play into their tell-
bank on you.
Chapter 11: Camouflaging Your Play and  Dodging Traps 133
Mark Harlan, kid
I began playing in card rooms at 21 (as soon as I was able to), back in the dark ages
of poker. This was that nearly unthinkable time when poker was still looked upon as
a vice, rather than prime-time TV material, and mastodons freely roamed the Earth.
At any given poker table it was very common for me to be less than half the age of
the next youngest guy (and it was always a guy) seated there.
Instead of wigging out about being the young guy, and trying to figure out how to add
to conversations about events that had happened before I was born, I quickly
embraced it. Every time I’d play, I’d wear my Mickey Mouse T-shirt and I’d make it
a point to take a comic book with me to the table.
Did it work?
Are you kidding me? People would line up to play at the kid’s table. It became so
common for me to be I.D.’d that I’d put my driver’s license in my comic as a book-
mark and when I won my first big pot, I’d put it on the table because I knew it’d be
about two minutes before security was asking me questions. (For some reason, I
found that people became much more concerned about whether I was of legal age
if I was winning, but they didn’t seem to care if I was losing.)
The age demographic of poker has changed so much that this strategy wouldn’t work
nearly as well today. (It’s common for an entire table to be younger than I am — I’m
in my 40s — so now I play the role of the “old guy.”) But if you watch carefully and
think about the dynamics of your local poker room (or even your home game), you can
come up with something that’ll work for you just as well.

If showing cards to enforce a table image seems too dangerous or
difficult, never show a hand. It’s the easiest and safest thing to do.
(I only show a hand when I have to.)
Changing your style
Sometimes your best-laid plans can suddenly run amuck through
nothing more than a turn of an unfriendly card or an unexpected
call. You know how it goes: You were playing along just fine as
Mr. Tight and suddenly — boom! — it gets exposed that you were
actually trying to bluff a pot with your 2-7 off-suit.
When this happens, don’t sweat it. Just get ready to drop into
another playing style. As soon as your opponents see a gap, or dif-
ference, in your play from what they were expecting, they’ll start
treating you differently. This means you can start treating them dif-
ferently as well and it’s the perfect time to shift gears in both your
strategy and your table image.
When you shift gears in playing styles like this, just make sure that
you aren’t playing into a style that they’re starting to expect. For
example, if you get caught bluffing, don’t suddenly start bluffing
more because that’s what your opponents will be playing against
from you. Instead, you should tighten up a bit, and consider doing
something like becoming more aggressive with your bets when you
are in a pot.
Avoiding Pitfalls
Setting your own style, and then exploiting it, is only half the
battle. The other half is watching out when other players are
doing it to you.
First and foremost, even though I talk about your visual table
image earlier in this chapter, you need to ignore all of that in your
opponent (unless she is really inebriated). Instead, you should
focus exclusively on her betting actions. She can tell all the jokes
she wants, wear a hula skirt, and whisper in your ear what her hole
cards were every time, but it may all be one giant concoction. The
betting is the real thing.
The one absolutely and positively true thing that your opponent
expresses is his bet. He’s saying definitively that he believes his
hand has a chance to win and he’s backing it up with his money.
This is what you need to watch in your opponent. (And when he
doesn’t bet is nearly as important as when he does.)
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
134

When aggressive players merely call
Let’s say you’ve been playing at a table with a demon woman for a
few hours, and pretty much any time she enters a hand, she raises.
All in all, she’s a very aggressive and very tough player. On a turn
card, you bet, expecting the usual raise — and instead you just get
called. There are a few possibilities as to what this could mean —
read the sections that follow, and think about the situation relative
to your opponent’s position on the table and her previous betting
patterns and behaviors.
Waiting for a draw
The absolute pure play if you have pot odds for a flush or straight
draw (see Chapter 12 for more on pot odds) is to merely call until
you hit it. Different players will play differently (it’s common for
very aggressive No-Limit players to make a slight raise when they
are on a draw — or push all-in if they have a pair and a draw), but
the “right” play is to just call.
Look closely at the board and try to remember the types of cards
you’ve seen that person play before — don’t forget to factor in the
position he’s in. What you’re looking for is three suited cards or
three cards that a set of connectors (or gapped connectors) could
play into.
An aggressive player will often raise on a draw on the flop but cool
down if the turn card missed his hand.
Backing away from a possibly better hand
If an aggressive player suddenly backs off, another possibility is that
the player is holding a big hand that has now become threatened.
For example, if she seemed all too eager to cap the betting pre-flop,
but the flop came out as a rainbow A-10-6, it’s very possible that
she’s holding a high pocket pair — Queens or Kings. What was a
great hand has now gone downhill with the exposure of the Ace.
Setting a trap
The other possibility when an aggressive player backs off is that a
hand has been made and she’s setting a trap for you. If you’ve
established that you’re a player who is willing to drop a hand,
you’ll often get a flat-call after the flop and a raise on the turn
(because the bets are doubled there).
If you ever receive a flat-call in No-Limit, especially from an experi-
enced player on a large bet, you’ve definitely fallen into a trap.
Unfortunately, you can’t reach into the pot and take your money
back saying, “Sorry, I didn’t mean that.” That means you should do
Chapter 11: Camouflaging Your Play and  Dodging Traps 135

the next best thing: Check on the next card. And although it’s true
that checking will, in fact, get you a big bet on the end from your
opponent, it will keep you from sending any more money her way
in the meantime. Just be glad you didn’t push all-in to begin with.
Raising and reraising after rounds
of checking in Limit
In Limit, when you see raising and reraising after checking through
the flop or the flop and the turn, you are definitely looking at oppo-
nents holding big hands. Unless you’re playing against raising
maniacs (which certainly can happen, but you’ll always know well in
advance if it is), you should be quick to drop a hand if you’re in a pot
with more than one player — unless you’re holding a very big hand.
For example, say you have the 9 8 on the button. There are
three other callers in the hand. The flop and the turn both were
checked through and on the river the board looks like this: J 10
3 Q 4. By the time the river betting gets to you, it has already
been bet, raised, and reraised. The good news is you have a strong
hand, a Queen-high straight. The bad news is there are two other
straight possibilities (9-K and A-K), as well as heart flushes.
In the example, your hand is good, but it’s still a loser. Yes, it’s hard
to let go of a five-card hand, but never forget that a second-best five-
card hand is nothing more than a first-place loser. Panicked betting,
especially in Limit, always means that someone has a good hand.
Judging when you’re dominated
The biggest way to dodge a trap is both to recognize, and to admit,
when you’re dominated. As I said in the last section, the hardest
time to admit you have a losing hand is when you’re holding a very
good hand yourself. Don’t let your blinkered, eye-rolling reaction to
your hand let you overlook bigger forces at play.
Here are some examples of situations to look out for:
 You hold a big pocket pair, but larger cards appear on the
board. For example, you have Q-Q but the flop is A-K-8.
Congratulations! Your great starting hole cards are now
losers. You should probably fold in any circumstance, but 
definitely if you’re up against two other players — someone
there is holding an Ace or a King.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
136

 You have a big pair, but the board is screaming about other
possible hands. If you have A A and the board is Q J
10, you have a world of problems. Diamond flushes are possi-
ble here. Two pair is likely. K-9 is a straight. Any diamond gives
a flush draw. In Limit you can check-call with a hand like this, in
No-Limit you’ll save a ton of money by checking and folding.
 You have a tiny end of a straight that is easily made bigger.
If you’re holding 7-7 and the first four cards are J-10-8-9, your
hand has morphed from a pair to a straight; unfortunately,
anyone with a Queen has a bigger straight. In Limit, you can
check-call this hand. In No-Limit, you can try a small reraise
on a small initial bet, but fold on anything large.
 You hold the “tiny sides” of full houses. If you were playing
9 10 from the button and the first four cards are 10-10-A-A,
you’ve officially got a problem. Although it’s true you flopped
trips and then went full, anyone holding a single Ace has an
even bigger full house (Aces full of 10s seriously stomping
your 10s full of Aces). In Limit, you can bet and then check-call.
In No-Limit, you should bet minimum amounts to make it look
as though you’re trying to maximize an Aces-full full house.
But really what you want to do in all cases is start thinking
about dropping this hand if you get any hints of activity
against it at all.
 You hold a weak two pair on a board that is made for
stronger two-pair versions. J-Q looks pretty good against
an A-Q-J flop until you stop and consider that A-Q or A-J is
on top of you and K-10 gives a straight. Opponents who play
dangling Aces can get punished here, for sure, but the risk is
pretty high — especially in Limit where they get two shots at
pairing their other card (or the added possibility of drawing
a straight when holding A-K or A-10).

any math-o-phobes avoid the game of poker simply because
they don’t want to deal with the math involved, or they
think they can’t handle it. And although it’s true that you do need
some math, there’s not as much as you might think — and you can
cheat your way through a lot of it, either through some easy memo-
rization, or just by remembering some of the basics you already
know about a deck of cards (for example, there are four suits).
Many of your decisions on a poker table, especially when calling a
bet in Limit, will have some mathematical basis. Pot odds crossed
with the chances of making a hand, in particular, are worth know-
ing and using to your advantage.
Don’t sweat the work, though. If you’re able to memorize a multi-
plication table, you can handle all the math you need for poker.
And if you want to get really rabid about it, you can get as good in
mathematics as the best pros in just a few weeks — because there
just isn’t that much to master.
I’m not talking calculus here — it’s really just multiplication and
division. And you can always make things easier by approximating.
Delving Fact from Fiction
in Math and Poker
Through the wonders of hidden “lipstick” cameras in modern
poker events, television has taken to displaying the odds of any
given player beating the others to an exact degree of precision as

any hand in a poker tournament is played through. It makes for good
viewing because you can ooh, ahh, and groan as the player you love
to hate draws his 24.7 percent shot to beat everyone’s favorite card
player sitting at the same table. It’s fun to watch — and if you have
even a passing interest in probability, you can get a voyeuristic kick
out of watching the numbers change as cards are dealt. It’s cool in a
geeky sort of way, because it gives you a deeper feel for what each
card on the board means relative to the hand as a whole.
Unfortunately, it also gives the viewing public a warped suggestion
that mathematics is the all-seeing, all-powerful force behind poker.
It idealizes the card world as some sort of grand place where math
is all, and everything else kneels at some elaborate, fractal-ized,
numerical throne. The problem with this notion is that not only is
it essentially untrue, but it also takes some of the importance away
from the things that actually do matter.
Close enough is good enough
When you’re playing at a poker table, especially in live action,
don’t get so enmeshed in the odds, statistics, and probabilities of
what’s going on that you lose track of the greater part of the game.
The math in this chapter is important, yes, but it’s rarely the over-
riding way you will make a decision. There are many other factors
to take into account as you play:
 The personality of the players still in the pot (see Chapter 8)
 In a tournament, your relative chip standing (see Chapter 17)
 In No-Limit, the likelihood of the action on the next card fol-
lowing the one that has just been exposed. (For example, if a
player is just now pushing half of his stack, and you call, you
better believe you’ll be seeing the other half coming at you on
the next betting round.)
If you get so bent out of shape on the math stuff that you lose track
of the bigger picture, you’ve done yourself no good. In fact, in
those cases, the math is actually hurting you.
All the math in the world isn’t going to prevent a bad beat — it’ll
just give you justification for what you did as you wipe the tears
from your cheeks and become aware that your wallet doesn’t seem
as thick. People can, and will, play cards that are mathematically
“incorrect.” Some of them will beat you as a result. Get used to it,
accept it, and understand that in the long run these are your best
customers. (In the short term you may want to get used to chewing
on a towel.)

In the following sections, I walk you through enough math basics to
make you a very competitive player. From a pure math point of view,
the most important thing you should do is have a fairly good idea
of the numbers that you’re working with. They do not have to be
exact — just close enough to know if you’re making the right play.
In the online world, math becomes slightly more important.
Because you can’t get as good a feel for the players, poker is a little
bit more of a pure mathematical game. See Chapter 15 for more on
online play. If you find you’re really interested in computer poker,
you should pick up a copy of my other book Winning at Internet
Poker For Dummies, co-authored by Chris Derossi (Wiley) — it
dovetails almost perfectly with this book.
Understanding players is better
than understanding numbers
Okay, so it’s true that my degree is in applied mathematics, and
yeah, I’ve always had a knack for numbers and calculation. That’s
not the reason I tend to talk down the importance of math in poker.
The reason I do is you’re not playing a table full of computers —
you’re playing human beings. They will fake, conceal, bluff, ignore,
and misplay. They will also have tells, predictable patterns, and
behavior that will take you far outside the mathematical world.
For an extreme example, say you’re playing Johnny Rocket. All this
guy ever plays is an Ace with some other card. If you’re holding a
pair of cowboys (K-K) and the flop is A-10-3, guess what? You have
a losing hand. At this point, all math is going to do for you is let
you know your likelihood of hitting another King. The reality is,
right this very second, you’re beaten. You’re losing, and you’re
losing badly. Unless you have the pot odds to make a call (unlikely
because you only have two outs) or you can convince Johnny he
should fold with a bluff, you need to fold now.
This example is an unlikely scenario, but as you play, and as your
perceptual skill grows, you will be amazed at how easy it is to read
certain players. In your poker life, you’ll definitely make calls that
are not mathematically correct, but are absolutely right relative to
the player you’re up against.
If you have an extremely good idea of the way a certain player
behaves, and you see a set of community cards that spell danger
or death for the poker hand you’re holding, ignoring the behavioral
pattern of your opponent is a huge risk to your bankroll. For mathe-
matical reasons, do not ignore what you already know about the way
a player plays any given hand or situation.
Chapter 12: Considering Mathematics 141

Chapter 8 is all about playing the other players. At some point,
either before or after you finish reading this chapter, you should go
back and review Chapter 8. I have a large circle of (winning) poker
playing friends who are also math guys. All of them say that play-
ing the player is more important than the mathematics of the
game. They don’t say this because they know math — they say it
because they know that playing your opponent is much more
important. The psychologically astute player will beat the pure
math geek every time.
Taking a Shortcut with Math
Now that I’ve spent enough time bending your mind about how
unimportant math is to poker, I guess it’s time for me to actually
show you some.
Counting your “outs”
An out is a card (or sometimes a sequence of cards) that will turn a
losing hand into a winner. People tend to make a big deal out of
counting outs, but it’s really pretty simple as long as you keep in
mind the basics of a deck of 52 cards, namely:
 There are four suits in a deck.
 There are four of each rank in a deck (for example, four 2s).
 There are 13 cards of each suit.
You count one out for every card that will make your hand.
Looking at Figure 12-1, say you’re dealt 8 6 on the big blind
with no raise — a good deal because you have a gapped suited
connector and get to play “for free.” There are three other players
still in the hand and the flop is 5 4 A.
Because there are three other players in the hand, it’s a certainty
that you are behind. All it takes is one other player having a card
bigger than an 8 and you’re currently losing. Because there are
three other players, it’s also pretty likely someone is now holding
a pair of Aces (although probably not trips because that person
probably would have raised pre-flop).
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
142

Figure 12-1: A hand with 12 outs.
Assuming you have to beat a pair of Aces here, you now have the
following outs:
 Four 7s are outs that make the gut shot straight draw.
 Nine clubs are left in the deck, but one of them is the 7, so
really there are only eight other clubs that count as outs to
make the flush.
Add those two together and you have a total of 12 outs.
There is a risk in calculating your outs: You must make an assump-
tion on what the other player has. As a result, calculating your outs
is an imperfect way to measure what’s going on at the table. In
Figure 12-1, if one of the players has pocket 4s, it means she’s cur-
rently holding trips. If the turn card is the 5, you’ve made your
flush, but your opponent is now sitting on a full house (4s full of 5s),
essentially killing that out.
There are a couple of other disasters in waiting: someone holding
two clubs with one larger than your 8 (meaning all the clubs are
now fatal), or someone holding a 2-3 who has already made a wheel.
You can see how this actually reduces the number of outs you have.
Overvaluing your outs is balanced slightly by opponents who are
bluffing (you’re actually over them without knowing); as well as a
series of freak draws that can make you a winner (for example,
catching river 7 after the 5 in the preceding example gives you
a straight flush).

Chapter 12: Considering Mathematics 143

Just keep it simple: Close enough is good enough. In Figure 12-1,
you should assume you have 12 outs. And because you never see
anyone else’s cards, you never consider them in as you do your
counting. From a pure numbers point of view, you should act as
though they have never been dealt. Before the turn, you have 12
outs (7s and flush draws) and there are 47 cards left in the deck.
(You have already seen five cards: your two hole cards and the
three on the flop.)
Sometimes in professional card rooms you’ll see a card inadver-
tently exposed at the start of a hand (either through a dealing
mishap or an accidental exposure on mucking by a player). If that
happens, be sure to work the cards that you see into the numbers
you’re counting on your outs.
Calculating your pot odds
Pot odds is a term used to describe the ratio of the pot size relative
to the bet you have to make to call. For example, if you have to
make a $5 call on a $20 pot, your pot odds are:
20 ÷ 5 = 4
This is expressed as a ratio: 4-to-1. In other words, if you call for $5
and win, you are paid four times what your call cost you.
Note that you do not count the calling bet you put in the pot as part
of the pot odds. Again, in the example, you’re making a $5 call on a
$20 pot — 4-to-1 pot odds. You are not making a $5 call on a $25 pot.
Online you can easily calculate your pot odds because a running
total is always kept for you. In live action it’s a little harder
because you have to keep track yourself. You can do quick pot
addition in your head, but an easier trick is to just keep track of
how many bets have been made in front of you. Looking back at
Figure 12-1, for example, you already know the pot odds of any
call, before anyone makes a bet: Three players in the pot with
no raises, your big blind, and an uncalled small blind means that
the pot odds will be a little better than 4-to-1. If someone makes
a bet that you have to call, the pot odds will increase to 5-to-1
(because another bet has been added). If someone makes a bet
and another player calls in front of you, those pot odds increase
to 6-to-1.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
144

Try to avoid using math as a tell at the table. If you sit and start
babbling numbers under your breath, people can listen and figure
out what you’re drawing to. As much as possible, you want to not
let people know that you’re sitting and calculating odds — at the
very least it encourages them to behave as though they’re holding
cards over yours, even if they may not be.
Taking a Shortcut with Math
After you know your outs and the pot odds, you can begin making
mathematical decisions based on your play.
Combining outs and pot odds
The number-one rule for calling a bet: The odds of making your
hand must be better than your pot odds. This is the way you make
mathematical money playing poker (and it’s called positive 
expectation by math heads, positive expected value [+EV] by poker
sharpies). In simple English, all this means is that your reward is
greater than your risk when you’re trying to pull a card you need
out of the deck.
If you ever get confused about which has to be bigger, just use an
extreme example in your mind — for example, would you like to
be paid 10-to-1 for an even-money bet? Of course you would. That
means you want the pot odds bigger than the amount of your hand.
Using quick math tricks
When you go to do calculations in your head, you don’t have to
have the calculating accuracy of Rain Man. Use shortcuts when-
ever they present themselves.
For example, looking back at Figure 12-1, you know that you have
12 outs with 47 cards left in the deck. Your odds of making this
hand, therefore, are slightly better than 1-in-4. How do you know?
Forget about dividing 47 by 12 in your head — instead, just consider
that 12 in 48 is exactly 1-in-4. Because 47 is one less than 48, that
means your odds are a little bit better.
In Figure 12-1, this means any pot odds that are better than 4-to-1
make it correct for you to call.
Chapter 12: Considering Mathematics 145

Figure 12-2 shows the betting round after the flop. You checked,
one player behind you bet, and there was one caller and one fold.
Your pot odds are now better than 6-to-1 (four pre-flop bets, two
post-flop bets, and the small blind), and you have a slightly better
than 1-in-4 chance of making the hand, so you should call.
Figure 12-2: Your pot odds are better than 6-to-1. Call or fold?
When you need to do calculations quickly in your head, there are
several tricks you can use. Again, the important thing is to just be
in the right ballpark — you don’t have to be numerically accurate
to four decimal places.
The easiest thing to do when you’re counting outs is assume
48 cards for both the turn (it’s actually 47) and the river (it’s actu-
ally 46) because it’s very common to be dividing by even numbers.
Doing this will slightly underestimate your odds of winning, but
that’s okay. What you don’t want to do is overestimate and get it
wrong.
Considering implied odds
Implied pot odds takes the pot odds concept one step farther. That
is to say, you think about the ratio of what you should win if the
betting follows an expected pattern.

Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
146

For example, if you’re getting ready to make a call on a turn bet
and you can tell by the way the player behind you is acting that
he’s definitely going to make a call as well, you can include that
money in the implied-odds calculation.
By their very nature, implied pot odds are making large assumptions
about the betting and calling behavior of other people at the table.
These assumptions are reflected not only in the current betting
round, but also in all subsequent betting rounds for any given
hand. Because implied pot odds imply more money, you’ll end
up calling more. And calling more can be a certain way to lose a
bankroll. If you’re ever uncertain as to what your opponents will
do in subsequent betting rounds, you should make no assumption
about implied pot odds.
Pot odds are a strong mathematical fact. Your bet will be paid a
certain amount if you win. Implied pot odds are not a strong mathe-
matical fact — they’re guesswork and, by their very nature, a tad
questionable.
To give you an example of how implied pot odds might work, if
you’re playing at a table with a calling station (someone who plays
every hand, and always calls), you can go ahead and assume that
her money will be in the pot on every betting round and just add it
in to your calculations.
Typically, unless your opponents are extremely predictable,
implied pot odds won’t come into play much in Limit Hold’em. 
No-Limit, however, is another story. Any time you see a player push-
ing half a stack as part of a bet, you can be fairly certain you’ll see
the other half in the next betting round. In a similar vein, any player
who makes a gigantic call on a bet (say, 80 percent of his stack),
will almost always put the remaining 20 percent of his stack in the
pot before the hand is over (either as a bet or as a call). Be sure to
include the facts of these betting patterns in your calculations.
Flipping a coin
There’s one common face-off that happens on a Hold’em table that
is worth talking about in its own right, and that is an under pair
versus two over cards. (The classic face-off is 2-2, the worst pair,
versus A-K, the best set of over cards.) Partially due to television,
people often refer to these as coin-flipping situations.
Chapter 12: Considering Mathematics 147

Before any community cards hit the table, the under pair has a
very slight edge. The exact percentages depend on a few factors:
 The suits involved: It’s better for the pair if one or both of the
over cards aren’t in the same suit. That way they have a shot
at flushing on any four-suited community board, no matter
how the over cards are faring as cards are drawn.
 Interference with straights: If the pairs interfere with straights
of the over cards, they remove more of their outs. For exam-
ple, 10-10 is a more dangerous hand to A-K than 7-7 is because
it takes two cards away that make the Broadway straight.
 How small the pair is: A hand like 2-2 gets counterfeited by a
board of 3-3-4-4-5. Any opponent holding a card with a rank
greater than 5 win the hand. The bigger the pair, the harder it
is to get counterfeited.
 Gaps in the over cards: The bigger the gap in the over cards,
the harder it is for them to make a straight. Technically 10-J is
better to hold than A-K against 2-2 because it can work the
Broadway straight on the high side and 7-8-9-10-J on the low
side. (A-K can only work two cards to the straight on the low
side, and the A-2-3-4-5 wheel is missing a couple of possible
deuces to draw.)
These differences, though, are slight. If you think of the proposi-
tion as something like 55 percent to the pair and 45 percent to the
over cards, you’re going to be in the right ballpark. This is pre-flop,
of course, and assumes that the hand will be dealt to completion.
Post-flop, the over cards become desperate it they haven’t paired,
with the pair becoming dominant. If the over cards do hit on the
flop, the under pair the opponent holds can typically only be saved
by making a set of trips on fourth or fifth street.
Playing the coin flip in Limit
It’s rarely clear in Limit if you’re in a coin-flipping situation because
of the way the betting works (there’s not that obvious and immedi-
ate threat of all-in in your face). However, if you believe you’re in a
coin-flipping situation, you definitely have a call with either the pair
or the over cards (because your pot odds will almost always be
better than 1-to-1, thanks to the blinds and other callers).
Holding the small pair
If you’re holding the small pair, playing Limit, you can continue to
bet (even if you’re the first to bet), keeping a careful eye on how
your opponent reacts as she sees the up cards exposed.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
148

If your pair is higher in rank than the board, you can bet (and
raise) with impunity. Really your only threat is if someone is slow-
playing an over pair, if an under pair managed to hit trips, or if
something truly skanky happened like a big blind with 2-6 managed
to hit two pair.
Holding the over cards
If you’re playing the over cards in Limit and the flop hits blank, you
should consider dropping the hand unless your outs and pot odds
are telling you that you have a reasonable call.
The one exception here is if you think you can get your opponent
to fold with a bluff. Roughly speaking, if you think she’s twice as
likely to fold as she is to call, you should try it. Never forget: The
more you try bluffing, the more likely you are to be called.
Coin flipping in No-Limit
No-Limit is the place where you see, or at least suspect, coin-flipping
as coming into play. Pushing all-in pre-flop is a common move for
small pairs, especially:
 Early in a tournament, in an attempt to build a stack for later
 When short stacked, as an effort to double up
 As a semi-bluff, to back down bigger hands
As a general rule of thumb, in No-Limit if you think you’re up
against a better player, you should be eager to coin-flip with him
(especially if you’re holding the pair, which has a mathematical
edge). Random chance will boost your odds of beating him over
what your chances would be if you played for hours on end. If
you’re playing against someone you think is worse, you should
avoid the coin flip and instead battle with him through skill.
Playing the over cards in No-Limit
If you’re early in the action, I don’t recommend pushing all-in
immediately with something like A-K. You’re better off making a
sizeable raise (anything from three times the big blind, on up) and
then watching the action and behavior behind you.
Several callers, especially those who flat-call you, can help you
spot the Aces around the table. Every person holding an Ace or a
King is reducing your number of outs if you’re up against a pair.
When a short stack pushes, you can call or lay a big raise on top of
the bet to try to isolate that single player. As much as possible, you
want the action to just be between you and one other player. If you
Chapter 12: Considering Mathematics 149

see an all-in fest in front of you where multiple people are pushing
stacks that could significantly hurt you if you called, you should
pass — almost certainly you’re looking at a big pair (A-A and K-K
are both taking cards from the deck that you need), and with multi-
ple callers, there’s going to be an Ace or two in there as well.
However, A-K seriously dominates any other player holding an Ace
and trying to make a play for the pot. If you have even an inkling
that you’re up against Ace-anything, you should call.
Holding the small pair in No-Limit
If you hold a pair, you should coin-flip if you’re short stacked and if:
 You think your opponents will fold.
 You haven’t made many all-in plays. You don’t want multiple
callers to increase your chances of losing.
 Your pair is big. The bigger the pair, the more likely your
opponent will only have one over card rather than two, in
which case you’ll dominate him. Anything Jacks or better is
a potential fire-breathing monster for an opponent.
Consider just folding for now if:
 You can survive for several more hands.
 You’ve made several all-in plays and may get called by multiple
players.
 You have early action in the betting order.
 You have an exceptionally tiny hand (5-5 or less).
The big danger of playing all-in with a pair is that someone else will
call you with an over pair. If she does, you’re essentially doomed
because you only have two outs and you need one of them to keep
away from death. For this reason, if nothing else, just consider fold-
ing small pairs.
If you put nothing in the pot, you lose nothing by folding those
small pairs.
Using Math to Your Advantage
Because I’ve already got my numerical hard hat on, I’m going to dig
just a little deeper on the math vein here.

Memorizing a little goes a long way
The math in this chapter may seem like a hill that’s a little too
steep to climb at first, but if you go back and read it a couple of
times, you may well find that it starts making sense.
If not, you can still arm yourself with basic defenses. Table 12-1 is a
poor-man’s way to remember odds of any given occurrence.

If you want to know the odds of something happening on the turn
or the river, you can cheat and just divide the odds number in half.
For example, drawing a fifth card for a flush on either the turn or
the river happens once in two and a half times. Again, the true
odds are slightly worse (and because you’re fudging it twice, the
error becomes greater) at about 1-in-3, but saying 1-in-21⁄2 is good
enough to give you an idea.
In Table 12-1, every column represents wanting to draw to one
specific hand. If you want to consider multiple possibilities, like
drawing a straight or a flush (and you nearly always will), you’re
better off just counting up the outs. That way you won’t acciden-
tally count up cards in the intersecting scenarios (like a card that
both makes your flush and your straight) twice.

For the truly curious, Table 12-2 has some other probabilities you
might find interesting. No need to memorize, but the figures there
do give you a good feel for how likely certain things are to happen
at a poker table.

Calculating deeper
It’s worth saying a bit more about the concept of expectation. You
do not have to know or memorize this to be able to play, but it will
give you a glimpse as to the Big Math that’s lying under the hood of
your poker cruiser.
The expected value of a hand — that is to say, what it’s worth in
the long run — can be thought of this way:
Expected Value = [(How Much You Can Win) × (The Odds of
Winning)] – [(How Much You Can Lose) × (The Odds of Losing)]
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
152

Here’s an example of that equation, put into action. Imagine a magi-
cal world where you already know your opponent’s hole cards.
You’re holding A K, and your opponent has K J. The board,
before the river, shows Q 4 2 5.
In this scenario, your opponent holds a spade flush. You must draw
a spade, and if you do, you’ll have the best hand. There is $80 in
pot and your opponent has just bet $10, making the pot $90.
If you fold here, the expectation is easy to figure out. You lose $0,
100 percent of the time, because if you fold, you can’t win and you
can’t lose. In math terms, this would be an expected value of $0.
If you call, it gets just a little more complicated. Remember: You’ll
be throwing $10 into the pot if you call, so the pot you’re winning
or losing would now be $100.
Because you can see your opponent’s cards, you know you have
the seven spades here as outs. There are 44 cards left in the
deck, which also means that the other 37 cards do you no good
whatsoever. Using the equation for expected value, you get:
Expected Value = [$100 × (7 ÷ 44)] – [$0 × (37 ÷ 44)]
= $16
= $16
This means that if you call, with $10 here, in the long run, you’ll
win an average pot of $16. If you fold, you don’t win anything, so
the right answer is to call.
For the mathematically hard core, you can also go back and check
your work another way. Your true pot odds of winning are:
7 ÷ 44
or a little more than 5-to-1. The pot is offering 9-to-1, so you call.
Again, this isn’t the kind of math you’re expected to work at a poker
table (although many pros can and do). I just put it here to give you
an idea — and I make reference to this concept in Chapter 13.

Advancing Your Knowledge
In This Chapter
 Getting hip to game theory (bring your own mind)
 Playing poker by equity
E
ven if you master all the basics of poker and can play “per-
fectly,” like a robot would, that actually only takes you so far.
Setting aside the debate of whether there even is a “perfect” strat-
egy, if everyone played exactly the same way, poker would become
nothing more than a kind of complicated and sort of glorified game
of chance.
The big question, then, is how do you move ahead from there?
After you have down the basics, in order to really advance you
need to step back and think about how games themselves are
played. This level of thinking is different from worrying about
details like how to tell if a person is bluffing. Instead, you start 
considering that person’s play as a whole — and how you can beat
her because of the specific way that she plays.
Welcome to the world where you’ll now reexamine, and possibly
even question, everything you’ve learned. In this slightly surreal
world, don’t be too surprised if you go to look at the time and find
that your watch is melting — it’s probably also a good idea to have
an extinguisher handy in case your giraffe catches on fire.
I absolutely believe you should at least be aware of the underlying
concepts in this chapter — even if you never plan on actually prac-
ticing them — but this is a far cry from “I’ve never played poker
before, please teach me” stuff. Starting your poker career with this
chapter would definitely be detrimental to your poker health.

Playing with Game Theory
Game theory is a snooty phrase that mathematicians use to
describe the concepts behind strategy in a game, or in other
words, how you should think about the way you play a game.
In this section, I tell you what it means and how to use it.
What game theory means
The tack here is different because I start talking about overall play-
ing strategies as a whole, rather than the little tiny pieces that make
up the parts of any one strategy. Or looking at it another way, every-
thing in the first 12 chapters of this book can be thought of as one
theory. Call it whatever you want, but I just call it basic poker theory.
If it helps, you can also think of basic poker theory as being a
house on a street. Everything you use in basic poker theory —
the hands you play, the way you bet from position, and so on — is
just stuff in that one house. The obvious interesting question is,
“What do the other houses look like?”
Understanding how to use it
Aside from geeky math heads, it turns out that kids are probably
the best people in the world at understanding game theory — not
because they’re born with an uncanny mathematical sense of what
it all means, but because they play games with reckless abandon
and joy (unless you were a chess player at my house, in which
case you always cried when you lost). And because you were a kid
once, you’ve got a chance at actually knowing some of this stuff.
You probably still remember the thrill in learning how to never lose
in tic-tac-toe (if you didn’t, please send me a check for $10 and I’ll
send you my one-paragraph publication Winning at Tic-Tac-Toe For
Dummies by Playing in the Center Square First or Tying by Playing in
the Corner if the Other Guy Has Played in the Center First). And you
probably also remember playing Rock, Paper, Scissors (a game that
also goes by the snooty mathematical phrase, roshambo).
Roshambo, in case you’ve forgotten the fine points, was a game
with two players where you make a fist, shake it up and down twice,
and on the third shake made a hand signal for one of three shapes:
 Rock: A fist
 Paper: A flat hand
 Scissors: Two fingers (not raised up, for you Brits)
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
156

The two opponents compare shapes. For the winners: rock
smashes scissors, scissors cut paper, paper covers rock. Whoever
wins typically gets to do something unreasonable to the other
person, like slap him or take his drink. Ties just try again. Like
poker, it’s a fun game — unless, of course, you lose.
Now I ask you this question: In roshambo, what is the best shape
to play — rock, scissors, or paper?
Aha!
That’s right. There isn’t one because really it depends on what
shape your opponent is playing. If you’re up against Edward
Scissorhands, you could play as The Thing, always using your
rock fists, and you’d be a cinch winner. But The Thing wouldn’t
stand a chance against a book full of paper dolls in roshambo.
And to close the loop, the paper dolls would take a shredding by
Mr. Scissorhands.
This leads to very key element of game theory. In games that are
indeterminate by strategy — meaning Strategy A beats Strategy B
beats Strategy C, which in turn beats Strategy A — the most impor-
tant thing to figure out is what strategy the other person is using
and then to attack and exploit that strategy. So very cool.
But this is supposed to be a book about poker and not a crawl
through childhood memories, right? As you’ve already guessed,
this concept has huge poker ramifications. . . .
Poker is a complex enough game that you can pick any number of
theories, ranging from “I always fold and never play a hand,” to
“I’m all-in all the time,” to basic poker theory. Needless to say,
there are many more ways to play (including exactly the way that
you play the game of poker today). All these strategies have
strengths (even “fold all the time,” which will never give you the
heartbreak of a really bad beat), but they all also have weaknesses.
In fact, any poker theory or style (call it Style I ) can be beaten by
another theory or style (Style II), if in some way you’re privy to the
secrets of how Style I worked. In roshambo, if you knew that your
opponent was going to show paper, you could beat it.
Likewise, in poker, if you know your opponent is likely to bluff on
any last hand at a table just because he likes to place one last bet
before he leaves, you’ll beat him. Taking it a step farther, if you
knew precisely how multitime world champion Doyle Brunson
played every hand and every situation, all the time, you could beat
him. He’s one of the best players in the world and yet if you knew
how he played, you could shake him by the poker throat like a
Chapter 13: Advancing Your Knowledge 157

cheap carnival doll. (If you’ve read Chapter 8, you can see we’re
right back in the concept of playing the players again, but just
looking at it from a slightly different angle.)
Basic poker theory will give you what you need to play a very com-
petitive (and, once sharpened, winning) strategy at a poker table.
The techniques and ideas in basic poker theory are based on years
of practical human play and computer simulation. To keep your
bankroll healthy, happy, and warm you should never stray from it
without extremely good cause or reason — especially as a lame
excuse for a bad play.
Cashing In on Equity Theory
Equity theory is not a “normal poker expression.” It’s a phrase I use
to describe using knowledge of basic poker theory along with a
little psychology mixed with mathematics (in the form of equity
calculations). I like using the phrase equity theory because it
reminds you that the emphasis of your play is on equity calcula-
tions or concepts. If you’re not familiar with the mathematical con-
cepts of poker, or if you could use some review, read Chapter 12
before marching on here.
The remainder of this chapter assumes you have a very thorough
grasp of basic poker theory and that you’ve played it, used it, and
understand what it means in application. If you’ve never played
poker before, or if you aren’t familiar with the underpinnings of
general poker thought, do not start with this chapter and apply
these concepts. Without basic poker knowledge and experience,
this chapter could very well damage a developing poker game. If
you’re new to the game, skip over this chapter and go on to any
other in the book.
Cross-breeding the animal 
of psychology with the beast
of mathematics
There’s a new trend in music you may have heard in the last few
years called a mash, where two songs, or samples of two songs, are
played at the same time on top of one another. The result is noisy
sometimes, cool sometimes, and, every now and then, eerie.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
158

Hunting for new poker theories and styles is similar. Coolness is
definitely out there somewhere, but if you’re not careful, you’ll find
yourself getting involved in situations that leave you with a suffer-
ing bank account.
Using what you know against (people just like) you
Now that you understand basic poker theory, if you stop and think
about it you’ll realize that you know several things about your
opponents who use it, including:
 The kinds of hands they play
 The positions that they play those hands from
 The way they bet in different situations
The thing that is going to vary amongst your opponents, even if
they all use basic poker theory, is how aggressive or passive they
are. Using the tricks and techniques from Chapter 8, you can get
some idea.
The basic poker theory and the psychology of your opponent are
two of the pieces you need in the equity-theory puzzle. Math is the
other piece.
Bring on the players, bring on the math!
Consider this scenario: You’re playing in a No-Limit tournament
(more on these in Chapter 17), you’re in the final two (way to go,
see, I told you this book would work), and chips are evenly stacked
at 100,000 each. Blinds are getting pretty high at 5,000 and 10,000.
You’re on the big blind.
Louella in the small blind started the tournament very tight but has
been getting looser and more aggressive as the tournament has pro-
gressed. You’ve been using more or less the same tactic, maybe just
a tad more conservative, and keeping a watchful eye on her.
On this hand she opens with a raise to 30,000, and now it’s your
turn to act. It’s going to be 20,000 for you to call — about a third of
your stack will be on the table.
Freeze.
Fold, call or . . .
First take a look from the outside and forget all about what cards
you’re dealt. This should be easy to do because I haven’t men-
tioned them yet, but remember, Louella can’t see them either, so
it’s not that far-fetched of a concept.
Chapter 13: Advancing Your Knowledge 159

There’s a broad generality in poker, especially at the upper levels,
that calling is the weakest play you can do. You either raise to take
control of the hand or fold to play something better.
If you fold here, you give away 10 percent of your stack 100 percent
of the time. You just give it away. No fight.
You could just call, but if you don’t improve on the flop (and odds
are you won’t), you’ll either have to bluff your way through or fold
then, only to have lost more. What’s worse: You’re giving bullets to
a person who is getting more and more openly hostile.
What about raising? Well, the minimum raise here would be 20,000
more (you have to raise at least what she raised) and then you’re
in for half your stack. At that point it’s just going to be a coin toss,
because if she flat-calls you, half of all the chips on the table are in
the pot. It’s going to be a difficult proposition for either player to
drop the hand at that point, because as soon as she does, she’s a 
3-to-1 underdog in chips.
. . . All-in?
How about the big raise? How about pushing all-in?
The question to ask yourself is what do you think the chances of
Louella dropping this hand are if you push her all-in? She’s been
playing more and more aggressively. You know that she plays basic
poker theory and there are only two players left here at the table.
If she had a somewhat sturdy hand, say two cards greater than 8,
she might make a raise to take a shot simply to snatch the blind.
In fact, she may do that anyway. In the old basic poker theory
days, you might have let her do that — but here in Equity Theory
Land you might not.
You’d guess that 3 out of 4 times (or 75 percent of the time) she’d
fold in this exact position, right now, if you pushed her all-in.
You haven’t made any big moves and, although you’re getting
more aggressive, you haven’t banged heads with her. From the way
she’s acting at the table, her hand just doesn’t seem that strong.
Her hands tremored slightly earlier in the tourney when she had
pocket Aces and they’re not shaking now. She might respect you
and just back off. If she’s bluffing, she’ll almost certainly drop.
On the other hand, if she calls, she’ll probably only do that with a
pretty good hand and you’ll be playing this hand for the tournament.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
160

Writing the equity equation
If I write out the expectation (see Chapter 12 if you need to brush
up) as a couple of sentences, I say this:
75 percent of the time, you win 45,000 flat out. You’re guessing
she folds that often and you win. Simple.
In Hold’em, any two cards have roughly a 25 percent chance of beat-
ing any two other over cards on the table. So in the one-quarter of
the time that Louella doesn’t fold but instead calls, you’ll have a
25 percent sliver of the time that you win 100,000 through pure luck.
The bad news is you’ll lose 100,000 in the 75 percent sliver of the
time because you were bested pre-flop.
As an equation it looks like this:
Expectation = (0.75 × 45,000) + (0.25 × [(0.25 × 100,000) – 
(0.75 × 100,000)])
= 33,750 + (0.25 × [25,000 – 75,000])
= 33,750 + (0.25 × –50,000)
= 33,750 – 12,500
= 21,250
Whoa. That’s a positive expectation of over 20,000. That’s huge
when you consider that something like folding right now gives you
an expectation of 0 (you can’t win and you can’t lose).
That means pushing all-in right here, right now, is the right move!
But be aware of the ramifications of your actions. When you push
all-in, if Louella does pass, she’ll remember vividly and know what
you’re capable of. Every time you push all-in and someone passes,
it makes it more likely that person will call you in the future. As
that likelihood rises, the equation you’re working against changes.
The fine print
There are a lot of assumptions here, and irrespective of my whippy
equation in the preceding section, some of this is much less than
the hard science I’m making it look like. The big question, really, is
how likely is Louella to pass? The more likely she is to drop, the
better an all-in play is.
Chapter 13: Advancing Your Knowledge 161

You can play with the equation if you want, but the break-even
point with the betting set up as described is as low as 27 percent
for Louella folding. If Louella is more likely to fold than 27 percent,
then from a pure equity-theory point of view, the right play is push
all-in. If her odds of folding are less than that, the right play is to,
well, at least look at your cards.
Don’t expect, or even try, to do these kinds of calculations at the
table. This is a For Dummies book, not an admissions test for the
Rocket Science Academy of the Universe. Just play with the idea in
your mind and get a rough feeling of what it might take to win in
situations such as these.
Don’t assume that all raising situations in all circumstances come
down to a 27 percent chance of the other player folding. That just
happens to be the number for the example shown here.
Part III: Movin’ On to Higher Stakes: Advanced Strategies of Hold’em 
162
Getting in Louella’s dress
Whenever you play an opponent in any game of skill, it’s worth taking a hard look at
the situation from her side, which means it’s time to jump into the skin of Louella
and imagine the scenario that’s been described here.
If she has a monster starting hand, like Q-Q, K-K, or A-A, she’s going to be pleased
(especially after she’s seen your cards), because she’s going to be sitting heavily
over you with something like an 85 percent edge (assuming you have a relatively
normal hand). Unless there’s a lightning bolt of luck, you’re most likely going to expe-
rience the tinny taste of loss.
If she has a somewhat anemic pair, like 6-6, she now has a very sweaty call to make.
She’s mildly ahead in the coin toss if you’re unpaired, but she’s crushed if you have
a pair over the top of her. And she has no idea what you have. It’s true that she’s
walking away from about a third of her stack if she folds, but that’s going to trump
a near-certain death if she thinks you’re sitting over her with a large pair.
If she’s holding a set of larger connectors, say J-Q, it’s very possible she will pass,
interpreting that you’re playing an Ace or a King sitting above her.
If she’s playing an Ace, she’ll probably call but not like it. The exception might be if
she’s playing an Ace with a low kicker — this would be easier to pass.
If she’s bluffing, she’ll almost certainly pass. People don’t like taking a shot at the big
money on a crying call that started out as a bluff.
As you can see, there are lots of ways for her to say no mas to this hand . . . and all
you need is one.

The important concept in this chapter is not these numbers, or
even how they’re derived, but the fact that there are other ways to
look at poker. A deeper form of the game, if you will.
Playing the cards
Do note that if you were to do something like not look at your
cards and just push all-in, Louella would be far more likely to call if
she had a hand. The instant she makes a decision to call, your odds
of winning drop considerably (assuming, of course, you’re behind
in the hand).
As you can tell, we’re out in a different land here. Is this bluffing?
Sort of. You could argue that it’s a mathematical basis for bluffing.
But it’s important to remember that moving all-in is the right play
here, even if you only have a one-in-four chance of winning the
hand straight out.
But really, it’s more just testing a person’s resolution with her
hand and the way she plays relative to basic poker theory. What
you’re really starting to do is pry under the floorboards of the
basic poker theory mansion to see where the weak spots are in
the foundation. (Actually, it’s more akin to ringing the doorbell
and running away.)
When you do actually look at your hand, and you discover it’s a
good one, you can play it as you normally would: raise, slow-play,
or all-in — whatever seems most appropriate for this opponent at
this time. But if you don’t have a hand, you still shouldn’t be afraid
of pushing if her odds of passing are as high as you’ve guessed
(as long as you don’t give away a tell that you have a bad hand,
of course).
Going back to square one
The catch in equity theory that I described in this chapter, if you
haven’t figured it out already, is that if someone knows you’re 
playing that way, she can take counteractions to put you down.
This includes such evil activities as not folding 75 percent of the
time and instead calling, or only making a run at you when she has a
seriously crippling hand and taking you out with a quick, deadly jab.
Just like roshambo, when this starts to happen, you need to move
to yet another theory, yet another style, searching for the inevitable
gaps in the way she plays. If you have a rock and your opponent
grabs paper, it’s time for you to switch to scissors.
Chapter 13: Advancing Your Knowledge 163

Any time you make changes or adjustments in the philosophy of
how you play, your bankroll will suffer for a bit. It takes a while to
fully try on, and adapt to, a new style, theory, philosophy, or
thought. In some senses it’s like being a beginner again. Don’t
expect to instantly become greater. But keep an eye on how and
what you’re doing — if you don’t see improvements, you’re trying
to bark up the wrong tree.
And don’t sweat it. This chapter is the gnarliest one in the book.
Everything before and after this chapter is “easier.” I just want to
make sure you got your money’s worth when you bought this
book. You can (and should) refer to this chapter in the future as
your game improves.

Doyle Brunson: Equity theorist
Doyle Brunson has won more World Series of Poker bracelets than any other person
in the history of poker (with the exception of Johnny Chan, whom he’s tied with).
Considering how much that tournament field is growing year over year, that’s a
record that could potentially stick in the record books for some time.
He’s famous for saying that he could beat most players without even looking at his
two cards (assuming that the other player didn’t know he wasn’t looking), based
entirely on that person’s play and demeanor on any given hand.
This concept lies right in the very heart of equity theory. If you look at the example
in this chapter, I talk about the hand being dealt and played without looking at the
cards.
Now Doyle may not think of himself as an equity theorist, but from a mathematical
schooling point of view, he’d be the dean of that department.

 Knowing your home game

 Getting your share
E
veryone starts his poker “career” at a home game. Maybe your
favorite uncle asked you to pull up a chair to the nickel-ante
game when you were a kid, or perhaps your dorm mates seemed
sloshed enough from the kegger that you figured you could learn
the rules and still beat them (turns out you were wrong, but that’s
another story).
Whatever the situation, home games are worth looking at because
they’re both the most fun and, in many ways, the most potentially
dangerous ones to play.
Determining the Level 
and Type of Play
Of any way you can play poker, home games have the biggest varia-
tion and variety. They can range anywhere from getting together
with a few pals with a roll of quarters and knocking down a few
cold ones, to extremely serious affairs with multi-thousand-dollar
buy-ins and professional dealers.
Home games are the roaming dog on the poker streets. Some are
cuddly and nice. Others are rabid and should be avoided at all
costs. Just like when you were a kid, before you try to pet the nice
doggy, it’s worth figuring out which type is in front of you.

Identifying stakes and games
When you play in any home game, you need to get an idea of the
stakes and games that you’re going to be playing before you go.
And for your bankroll’s sake, you need to get this as accurately as
you possibly can.
Gleaning the stakes
For some reason many people like to be a little coy about buy-ins —
especially when larger stakes are involved. I guess they think it just
sounds cool to be cavalier when you’re talking about a bunch of
money. If you’re getting answers that sound evasive, you can ask a
small battery of questions that will give you a better idea:
 What’s the buy-in?
 Are there rebuys of some type allowed?
 How much do people tend to win or lose in a session?
Knowing the games
Just as important as the stakes are the types of games that are
played.
 Do they play straight Hold’em or are other poker variants
(for example, Five-Card Draw, Omaha, Seven-Card Stud,
Dealer’s Choice) played as well?
 Do they play tournaments, ring games, or both?
 Are the games Limit, Spread-Limit, No-Limit, or a mix?
The Limit/No-Limit question is exceptionally important. Because of
the vicious swings in No-Limit, you can easily bust out (especially
if you’re playing in a rebuy tournament format — see Chapter 17
for more). You want to be sure to bring a wad of cash that will sup-
port your play (while also being sure to not play an amount that’s
hazardous to your bankroll as a whole — see Chapter 3).
Playing with friends
All my favorite games, and the vast majority of my best times play-
ing poker, have been with my pals. (These games aren’t my most
profitable, though — I think it’s because I just don’t pay as close of
attention, or care as much, as I do in a professional environment.)
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
168

Playing with friends is easy and fun. It’s a great way to unwind and
gives you an interaction that’s a considerable step above watching
whatever game is on the tube.
There are a couple of things you need to watch out for, or at least
be aware of.
Watching out for the hotheads
There are some people who take many things in their lives, but
especially poker, a little too seriously. There’s something about
poker and the way it affects certain psyches that’s just a little too
caustic. I’ve seen a couple of different real-life friendships explode
over nothing more than an interaction at an otherwise “friendly”
Friday-night card game.
Poker is an interesting and fun game, but when it starts getting in
the way of real-life interaction, that’s just too much. Don’t ever be
afraid to leave a game early if the vibe just doesn’t seem right, or if
you find that you yourself are getting too hot under the collar. It’s
not worth it.
Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like Home: Playing in Private Games 169
Those goofy venture capitalists
To give you an example of how important it is to determine a buy-in, there’s a group
of venture capitalists in the Silicon Valley, where I live, who have a monthly home
game. When they got wind that I was writing my last book (Winning at Internet
Poker For Dummies, with Chris Derossi), I miraculously received an invitation.
“What’s the buy-in?” I asked, as I could hear the odd sound of shears being sharp-
ened in the background.
“Oh, just a few bills,” the Italian-loafer-wearing lad assured me.
In gambling parlance this would mean a few hundred dollars. But I knew this was
a circle of folks who pay more than that to have the wheels polished on their sports
cars every week. Some more pushing and prodding brought out the truth: Typical
wins and losses in the game would run around $10,000. In the recent past, people
had dropped as much as $60,000 — and more than one person in the last year had
made $100,000 in a single sitting.
To answer your question, no, as tempting as it was, I did not play — probably for-
ever making it impossible to raise any venture capital for future start-ups.

Dealing with demigods
Some home games have people who are either so wrapped up
in the game or so bent out of shape on their own ego trips that
they control nearly every action. They’re easy to spot because
they sit and bark out commands on what to do when. All that 
matters to them is the poker game and the action going on sur-
rounding it.
These kinds of guys (and they are always guys) are surprisingly
common in home games. I used to play in one home game
where the “poker room coach” drove me insane enough that I
simply quit playing. There’s another where I tolerate the guy
only because the game is really loose and they always have
good food.
The best piece of advice I can give you is to find your points of tol-
erance and play within them. You can always find a game somewhere
(especially these days), so if you’re playing in one you don’t like,
quit it and look for one elsewhere.
Meeting strangers
Usually the way you meet someone new in a home game is through
a mutual acquaintance. Maybe your work pal’s cousin is in town, or
a couple of old friends hook up after a few years apart. Those are
the easy and obvious situations.
There is a new breed of home game that is becoming more
common, mostly through the wonders of the Internet, and that is
groups of people playing together who don’t really know each
other outside the game. Maybe it’s a bunch of people who read the
same newsgroup, people who all go to the same school, or people
who get to talking over an Internet poker table and decide to get
together and play live-action.
These sorts of feral card games vary widely. The majority are just a
bunch of people who like the game and want to get together for a
good time, but it’s still worth watching your back for the few indi-
viduals who aren’t on the level. Make sure to find out the stakes
and the games played before you show up. You might even want to
stop by and say “hi” once before you play, just to get a lay of the
land (it also can keep you from getting rolled for your cash if the
people involved are less than savory).

What You Should Give
People running home games will tend to expect different things for
running the game. Most will probably want nothing more than help
in cleaning up the room after it’s been trashed over a few hours of
poker (which of course you’ll do, right? right?). Some hosts may
want more.
Skimming the pot
Some houses will want to take their own version of raking the pot,
known in gambling parlance as a skim. Skimming is where things
start to get dicey, so you need to know about it in more detail.
Good skimming
At some home games, the host provides all the refreshments and
then takes a dollar or two out of the biggest pots until he’s paid
himself back. I have no problem with this; it’s a very equitable way
to pay the expenses — the winner doesn’t mind throwing a chip or
two out of a big pot, and the losers are watching their money walk
away anyway.
The skim, of course, should be limited to the actual food cost.
(I used to play at a home game where the proprietor would skim
a little more if he was losing — typically it’s not the kind of thing
I would tolerate, but the game was so lucrative for me that I
didn’t mind.)
If you’re going to be playing in a game with a skim, you don’t need
to bring your own food. Or, if you do, have the people running the
game throw you a buck or two to cover it.
Bad skimming
In the other kind of skimming, a home-game host takes the equiva-
lent of a rake — a chip or two out of every pot (or every pot of size).
The problem is that now this “home game” is acting like a profes-
sional card room and, depending on the state the game is happening
in, that means your gentle host is either operating a card room
without a license or just flat-out breaking the law. Setting aside
what the rake does to your money on the table, when you play in a
game like this you’re at a certain amount of legal risk. If this game
gets busted while you’re playing in it, you’ll likely have to make an
uncomfortable call to someone from jail.
Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like Home: Playing in Private Games 171

Although it’s unlikely that any given government would come after
you for being in the game (the people they really want are the folks
running the game), it’s very possible that your cash could be held
as evidence. If you’re a college student, you could risk expulsion
from school. (There’s also the more diabolical thing that can
happen playing in a game like this, which is a fake bust, where
someone who isn’t actually a cop comes in and takes the cash.)
In case you haven’t figured it out by now, you should not play in a
home game that is skimmed. Your personal risk is too high, and for
some reason places that condone this kind of behavior also tend to
be dens of other types of iniquity (drugs, prostitution, weapons, and
so on). It may look cool when you see something like this in the
movies, but the phrase you should be thinking about is what it would
feel like to hear the phrase, “Could you please tell the court. . . .”
Bringing on the refreshments
Any time you play in a home game, especially as a new member to
the game, you should always bring enough food and drink to share.
For snacks, you want to bring anything that’s not greasy (like potato
chips) or sticky (like fruit or Gummy Bears), because those kinds
of items tend to spoil cards over time. It’s also better to get some-
thing you can easily reseal and take back home if you end up with
leftovers.
If your main goal for the evening is to win some cash, stay away
from alcohol but consider dosing up on caffeine to keep alert.
What You Can Get
Especially in a home game, you want to make sure you get what
you want out of the game. As I mention in Chapter 1, consider what
you want: Good times? To make a little money? To sharpen your
poker skills? Whatever it is, make sure you know what you want
and get it from your home game.
Enjoying the situation
Have a good time. You’re not playing in the World Series, so that
means you can leave your shades and your bad-ass go-ahead-and-
call-my-bluff looks at your home (unless, of course, that’s part of
what gets you off).
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
172

Don’t get so wound up in the games, or the beats, that you lose
track of the bigger picture of just having fun. And if you play in a
home game you just don’t like, bag it and play somewhere else.
You can always find another game somewhere.
Watching the action
The best learning tool that a home game can give you, particularly
if you’re playing against people you know away from the card
table, is a dictionary (that you’ll build from scratch) for reading
players. Really study the other players at the table and see
how they react as they win and lose. Watch how their play
changes over time (particularly in respect to their bankroll and
fatigue).
Everything you learn here isn’t designed so you can keep track
of these particular players (although that is a nice side effect, 
especially if you end up playing with them many times); instead,
this is your first step into a deeper study in general poker 
psychology.
Focus the majority of your concentration on the hands where
you’re just sitting out. This gives you a chance to examine
players without the filter of your own personal prejudices and
without emotions being involved. Lots of times, especially if
you’re with your buds, they’ll show you their hole cards, giving
you a rare chance to tie personal reactions to very specific 
situations.
Before you play in a home game, have another look at Chapter 8
for the kinds of things to look for.
If you ever wander into a professional card room, the knowledge
and experience you gain from studying the reactions at home
games will give you a tremendous step up in what can be an other-
wise intimidating experience. The edge this will give you over an
online-only player is enormous.
Looking for the unusual
One of the things professional card rooms have that home games
are lacking is the concept of surveillance. No one is really watching
what’s going on with the game as a whole, and this can lead to
problems.

Mistakes
If you’re playing with your pals, cheating is pretty unlikely (if it is
likely, man, you need a new set of pals). More common are hazards
and mishaps:
 Cards getting damaged during play: This is easily the most
common thing I see happen at home games, especially those
that are using cardboard-based cards rather than plastics (see
Chapter 20 for more). Aces, in particular, tend to get warped
because people hold and play them more than the other cards
in the deck. If you notice the cards starting to show noticeable
bends (the corners will start lifting up), ask for a change of deck.
 A card getting dropped on the floor: This tends to happen
more with Stud than it does with Hold’em (because more cards
are dealt in more crazy positions in Stud), but it definitely can
happen. Make sure to count the deck occasionally.
 Owners forgetting how much they buy in for: Lots of times
whoever is acting as the house will just give herself chips,
instead of putting cash in the box for the house. If the house
player is losing, she may dip in multiple times and forget how
often she does. To keep this from causing problems, on any
home game, all players at the table should be cashed out first,
before the house player takes any remaining money.
 Players getting cashed in or out for the wrong amount:
When you buy chips, make sure you’re given the right amount
(watch everyone else, too, to make sure they’re given the
right amount as well). When cashing out, count your money,
especially if it’s a large number of small bills. People who don’t
deal with cash on a day-to-day basis often make mistakes.
Cheating
Unfortunately, any time money is involved in any transaction,
cheating is a possibility. It should go without saying that if you’re
playing in a home game where you have a strong suspicion that
there’s cheating, you need to permanently quit playing that game.
My experience in home games has been that people are far more
likely to make an honest mistake than they are to cheat, so if you
find something awry, don’t automatically assume you’re being
cheated.
However, due to a general lack of surveillance, home-game cheat-
ing can happen. (I’ve seen it twice — I wish I could say I hadn’t —
and have suspected it strongly a third time.)

Here’s a list of things to be on the watch for:
 People withholding cards from the deck (also known as
the ace up the sleeve): What you want to be suspicious 
of is people who seem to be showing down the same card
(or cards) too often. Deck counting will help keep this to a
minimum.
 Chip stealing or swapping: Know your stack any time you
leave the table and keep an eye on those of your opponents.
Any time you see unaccounted chips showing up in an oppo-
nent’s stack, something is going on. In a ring game, the added
chips don’t matter (assuming the player isn’t stealing them
from the house and then slipping them in — if so, it will put
the accounting off at the end of the night), but in a tourna-
ment, someone may be grabbing the chips from the chip stock
and slipping them to his stack. In tournaments, the house rule
should be that all chips are kept on the tournament table at
all times.
 Unusual dealing habits: What you’re looking for is someone
who deals cards in a very unusual or awkward manner — 
particularly if he deals off the front of a deck rather than from
the corner. Another possibility is a thing known as flashing,
where a dealer gets a peek at a card sometimes before it’s dealt.
Do note: If someone is an extremely good deck mechanic, you
won’t be able to tell he’s cheating you. And whatever you do,
don’t confuse someone’s lack of familiarity with handling a
deck of cards with an inability to deal. That 3-year-old sitting
across from you isn’t a card shark — he just can’t shuffle a
deck of cards.
 Collusion: You want to be aware of some players signaling
others, either to the quality of your hand or theirs. This isn’t
as important in Hold’em as it is some other poker games, but
it’s still worth watching for.
 Marked cards: This almost never happens anymore,
although there is a thing known as smudging, where a player
will intentionally deface a card (or series of cards) so she can
recognize them facedown around the table in later hands.
This one is easy to watch for — all cards should look the
same, always.
If you’re pretty sure that cheating is going on in a home game, quit
playing — and never go back.

Online Games
In This Chapter
 Finding a good place to play
 Sizing up differences between the online and the real world
 Being careful
T
he world’s largest poker parlor is no farther away than your
computer. You can plug in, log on, and go, go, go!
Even though getting an account and playing is simple, there are
some things you should be aware of first — namely, the differ-
ences, hazards, and glories of online play.
And now for my (nearly) shameless plug: If you find the online
poker bug biting you after reading this book, or after dabbling a bit
in online play, pick up a copy of my other book, Winning at Internet
Poker For Dummies. It goes into much more detail than this chapter
and what’s great is that you’ll get your full money’s worth because
there is very little overlap with what I cover in this book (because
Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies was originally written to
dovetail with Poker For Dummies, it doesn’t cover the general strat-
egy and play sections that you find in these pages).
Choosing a Site
There are, literally, hundreds of poker sites to choose from. All
of them offer Hold’em, Seven-Card Stud, and Omaha — some
go even farther, with things like Razz (Seven-Card Stud low),
Pineapple (a variation of Hold’em where you’re dealt three hole
cards), and Draw.

Picking a site
Online sites make their money the same way brick-and-mortar
places do — either by raking the pot or through a tournament 
registration fee. And they make that cash by the bucketful.
Because you’re going to be putting a little water in their money
buckets, you need to pick a place that you’re satisfied with and a
place that’s safe.
To find a possible site, just use your favorite search engine to
search on something like “poker room reviews” and read as much
about the different sites as you can. Make sure that the review site
you’re looking at isn’t sponsored, or owned by, the site that it’s
reviewing. (You can pretty easily tell, because no other sites will be
discussed.) At their very heart, all the poker rooms are the same —
I mean, come on, poker is poker — but the sites do vary in the way
you interact with them (known as the user interface), the way they
look, and the kinds of perks they give to the players.
Here’s a series of questions to ask when you’re considering a
poker site:
 Does it support the large transfer agents (NETeller and/or
FirePay)? If so, that’s a good thing, because only legitimate
sites can have accounts with those folks. (The transfer agents
have to protect their integrity as well.)
 Is the site located in a gaming jurisdiction that takes licensing
seriously? Malta, Gibraltar, Alderney, Isle of Man, Australia,
and Guernsey are all examples of locales with stringent gam-
bling laws — you want your site to be sitting in places like
these. The Kahnawake reservation in Canada and Costa Rica
are both a little less stringent (they tend to grant licenses to
poker sites because the sites have paid the money, as opposed
to being investigative, making sure that the sites are legit),
although there are several big and reputable sites there. If a
site is based in Kahnawake but has everything else on this
list, you’re most likely okay. Avoid anything in Africa or any of
the former Soviet jurisdictions; at the time of this writing, I’m
not aware of any legitimate site functioning in those locales.
 Does it play limits that you’re comfortable with? If not, move
along.
 Does it have enough players that you can find a game when
you want to? This factor is also important just for the site’s
financial well-being.
 Does the site pick up the transfer fees from your third-party
holding company? Because most do, it doesn’t make any
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
178

sense for you to do it. If you can’t figure it out from the poker
Web site, you can always write and ask the support people.
 Does the site use a securing function (a company such as
Thawte)? This gives you a level of security in the transaction,
and again, Thawte only works with people it trusts.
 Does it have a bonus you can earn? For more on this, turn to
“Exploring the bonuses,” later in this chapter.
Whatever site you choose, be sure to play several orbits on their
free play tables first to get used to the way the site acts and behaves.
If there’s nothing that bugs you, go with it. If you find something
about a site that you don’t like — even just a little bit — keep looking.
With the kind of money you’ll ultimately spend, you deserve to get
an experience you like.
One thing to watch out for on a site is overlapping action buttons.
By that, I mean that the future action buttons (the ones that say
what you’re going to do when it’s your turn), don’t have the same
intent as the present action buttons. So something semi-evil can
happen, like you go to click on the Check button, and just when it
gets to be your turn, it becomes a Call button instead.
Do not assume that free chip play is like playing for real money. It’s
not. You should play on the free chip tables merely to get a feel for
the way a site acts. Playing at length on a free table will actually
damage your poker game because soon you’ll find yourself raising
on things like a gut-shot straight draw — just like everyone else at
your table.
Transferring money
You get your money into the poker site of your choice by using a
third-party transfer agent. If you’re familiar with using something
like PayPal for an eBay transaction, the process in the poker world
is identical. The rub is that PayPal doesn’t support gaming sites,
which, as you might guess, has opened a multimillion-dollar indus-
try for companies that do support gaming. The big boys in the
transfer league are NETeller and FirePay — both are reliable and
can be trusted as much as any corporation that you give your
banking information to.
Like visiting the parents of your latest flame (or worse, your in-laws),
it can all seem a little scary and spooky at first. But after you’ve
done it once or twice, it all becomes second nature. From a pure
security point of view, by far the biggest thing you need to worry
about is keeping your account information (the account number
and password) safe.
Chapter 15: Opting for the Internet: Online Games 179

Don’t ever access your poker account or your transfer agent from a
public computer (such as one that is in your local library). If anyone
is storing keystrokes, he can look the information up later and you
can lose as much money as you transferred to a site. You do get a
warning in that you’ll get an e-mail saying a transfer is in process,
but it’s still much better to be a problem you never have to deal
with at all.
Exploring the bonuses
One way the online world trumps the brick-and-mortar operations is
in the ability to get bonuses. You’ll see claims such as “100% sign-up
bonus,” meaning if you deposit $100, you can earn a $100 bonus.
Are the bonuses too good to be true? Well, kinda yes and sorta no.
Like the real world, online sites make their money through the
rake. (In fact, they tend to rake less: Web sites typically rake at
5 percent — real-world card rooms usually do 10 percent.) But the
online card rooms’ operating expenses aren’t very high. Really they
only have to cover customer support, gaming license fees, and the
cost of maintaining a large bank of computers — they don’t have to
pay valets, cleaning staff, cashiers, cooks, bathroom attendants,
security guards, light-bulb changers, and so on. As a result, they
can rebate some of this rake back to the player and still make a
tidy profit.
If you read the fine print of a bonus (and you definitely should read
the fine print) you’ll see it’s not as easy as depositing $100, getting
$100 to match it, and cashing right back out again.
These are the things you need to look for on bonuses:
 Is it an “all-or-nothing” bonus? In other words can you only
be paid your bonus if you earn it in full? You want a bonus
that’s paid piecemeal over time. That way, if you leave a site
early, or you have a bad run of luck and lose all your cash,
you’ll still get a little kickback.
 Is there a minimum amount of necessary playtime necessary
to make the bonus? It’s not bad in and of itself if there is —
you just have to figure out if you can make it.
 Roughly how much bonus will you make over a certain
period of time? This can be tough to figure out sometimes,
so the best thing to do is look at the tables, figure out how
many hands per hour they’re playing (this is usually listed in
a column in the lobby), get a feel for the average, and see
how long it will take. If you’re comparing multiple sites, run
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
180

the figures a couple of times. What you’re looking for is a big
difference in how quickly you’re earning your bonus. If the
sites that you’re comparing are about the same, choose the
site you want to play based on some other preference (ease of
game play, number of opponents, other perks the site offers,
and so on).
 How big are the “chunks” of payout? For example, some
sites pay $20 worth of bonus at a time — this isn’t as good for
you, the player, as $1 at a time because you’ll leave some
bonus on the table when your time period expires.
If you keep track of your wins and losses (see Chapter 22), remem-
ber to put the bonus in a separate column. You certainly can still
count it as your money (because it is your money), but over the
long run, if you aren’t constantly paid bonus, it won’t give you an
idea whether you are truly beating the game.
Chapter 15: Opting for the Internet: Online Games 181
Checking up on Two-Fisted Karpov
In Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies I made reference to my pal, Two-Fisted
Karpov. He’s an actuary by trade (the people who figure out what your odds of dying
are) and the best applied mathematician I know. He’s also a fanatical record keeper
and plays about ten hours of online poker a week (he plays single-table tournaments
only, always two at a time Pot-Limit Hold’em and Omaha High/Low).
Even if he plays like a lunatic with two hands at once, he’s a winning player and I
asked him to send his data along for this chapter.
Two-and-a-half years ago, Karpov deposited (with both hands, I’m sure) $400 to a
major online poker site.
As of today his account stands at $1,633. He has also withdrawn $1,350 and at one
point won a $9,000 prize package (it was a poker cruise with a $7,500 tournament
seat and $1,500 in cruise fees/spending money). Which is to say that in 30 months,
he has won $12,000.
In that time, he’s played in 2,538 tournaments, representing over $68,000 in tournament
entry fees. Because all the tournaments he plays are of the pay-$10-+-$1-to-play type,
this means his poker site has made $6,800 off him.
Looking at this another way, Karpov has averaged more than $4 winning in every
tournament he’s played. It’s a spectacular result, but when looked at through the
average-filter, it sounds like very little.
And here’s something that will send shivers down your spine: At the low point (and
this was after many months of play), Karpov’s account was at $11. He explains, “It
was a bad combination of my starting to play higher limits in tournaments, while
simultaneously taking a series of bad beats. I cut back and things got better.”

Many sites give player referral bonuses — giving a piece of the
rake to any player who recommends a site to another player.
When you recommend a pal, make sure she lists you as a referrer.
If you’re going to play at a site where no one has referred you, you
can contact their customer support staff and see if you can refer
yourself. Sounds strange, yes, but some places will let you do it,
and it may give you yet another sliver of money back.
The vast majority of people who play poker in a situation where
it’s raked, lose money because of the rake. Any bonus you get is
better than none — and the more you can get, the better. I’ve seen
the accounting books of online gambling sites, and I would guess
that bonuses probably double the number of winners a site has.
A bonus is worth seeking out and using.
Watching Your Back
The online world is not without its treacherous spots. I help you
avoid them in the following sections.
Being wary of robots
In the sense being used here, a robot isn’t something that protects
Will Robinson from Dr. Smith. Instead, it’s a program that is designed
to play poker automatically.
When I wrote Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies three years
ago, robots online were merely a rumor — today, they are a well-
known fact. Some sites actively look for them and seize accounts
that are associated with them. Others claim they are on the lookout
for robots, but do nothing. A few don’t even try to fight the battle
and welcome them (because after all, a robot pays rake, just as
everyone else does).
There are a few things to be aware of about robots upfront:
 They can still lose, just as anyone else can.
 They don’t have the ability to see the cards you’re holding.
 To be the most effective, they need to play at higher limits
(because that’s the way you maximize your return and mini-
mize the ratio of your win to the rake taken).
Because they’re programs at their very heart, robots have pre-
dictable behavior. Anything that can be predicted, can be beaten
(see Chapter 13 for more on the concepts of game theory).
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
182

Especially at lower limits, I honestly don’t think robots are a prob-
lem for a player. But as a general rule, if you ever have your doubts
about a table you’re playing at, move to another. And if just the
idea of playing against robots is creeping you out, don’t play online
at all.
All the robots I know of are Limit ring-game players. If you’re a 
No-Limit player — and especially a No-Limit tournament player —
you have nothing to worry about as far as robots are concerned.
(But playing No-Limit, you may have a whole lot to worry about as
far as your bankroll is concerned.)
Spotting collusion
Collusion is what happens when multiple players share their knowl-
edge of a hand with each other in an effort to beat another player.
The best example of this would be two people talking on a cell-
phone or instant messaging (IMing), and telling each other what
their hole cards are. In theory this could give one player an edge
over another.
There’s also a more advanced possibility of this where one player
actually sits at multiple seats around the same table — essentially
seeing the cards for multiple players and picking and choosing
what to play from there. On the surface, this sounds pretty bad,
but the reality is a little bit different. For one thing, the operating
poker sites already know what all the hole cards are, so they can
see when one player backs away from another in a situation that
normally wouldn’t warrant it. They also keep a very close eye on
which players commonly play together as well as the Internet
address that all players log on from. Large-moneyed cash games go
one step farther and have humans on the back end who actually sit
and monitor the play as it happens.
The reality is that collusion just doesn’t happen that frequently,
and the host sites can very easily spot it and stop it when it does
happen.
If you sit and think about it for a second, imagine two players at
your table who are sharing their hole-card information with each
other. That, in and of itself, is of limited use. If they both get in big
raising battles to try to force you out, and then they quit betting,
well, that’s a certain tip-off to the site. If they always transfer money
back and forth when not at the tables, this is also a tip-off. If they
try to pick on people only sporadically to throw the monitors off,
they’re starting to open themselves up to other people pounding
them with big raises, because other players will think the colluders
are actually bluffers.
Chapter 15: Opting for the Internet: Online Games 183

As I said, it’s not that big of a deal.
If you play in tournaments, collusion is never a problem. If you play
in ring games, you’re better off playing at full tables rather than
short-handed ones (because if there is collusion, it’s more diluted
that way), and in general it’s probably a good idea to avoid tables
where everyone seems to know each other.

“This site is rigged” and other lies
The number-one thing you’ll hear about online poker is a claim that the site is rigged.
Every poker site in the world has someone whining about how some beat he’s just
taken could never happen in the real world.
First and foremost, a poker site makes its money off of action. Unlike a game like
blackjack or roulette, the poker site doesn’t have a vested interest in who wins or
loses — they just want a lot of people to play the game.
Also, if you’re using a site in a good jurisdiction (see “Picking a site,” earlier in this
chapter), the software the site is running has already gone through a significant
auditing process.
There are several factors at work here:
 You are seeing many more hands than you do in a physical card room. The more
hands you see, the more chances you get to hit low-odds possibilities.
 A mathematical edge doesn’t mean mathematical certainty. If one card on the
river will make someone a winner when she should have lost, and 52 tables are
playing, one table is going to have what appears to be a miraculous card.
 You tend to remember bad beats and freak cards. No one is surprised or com-
ments when the hand that is mathematically likely to win does.
 People don’t complain when they win.
 Losing players will often focus on anything aside from the fact that they’re
losing and either need to quit poker altogether, or need to improve their game
dramatically.
Never forget the fundamental mantra of a skeptic: Extraordinary claims require
extraordinary proof. If someone claims that a site is intentionally promoting action
cards (that is, cards that turn losing hands into winning ones), he needs to show
you a statistically significant number of consecutive hands that prove it.
But, of course, the people who claim this won’t be able to provide such evidence —
they won’t even know what “statistically significant” means in the first place. And
that is part of the real problem.

A
s far as flash, glitter, and “importance” go, you can’t beat a
professional card room as a place to play poker. With nice
tables, comfortable seating, professional dealers, and government
oversight, they’re the nicest places to play in the world.
Playing in a Professional 
Card Room
All professionally run card rooms essentially operate the same
way, and as you’d guess, they are all expedited such that you can
get playing as quickly as possible.
Card rooms always have a set of rules of play, usually posted some-
where or available as a handout. It’s always a good idea to ask
for them and take a quick glance, looking for anything unusual —
especially relative to their jackpots (see “Trying to Score a Jackpot,”
later in this chapter, for more on those).
Introducing the staff
Here’s a virtual tour of who-does-what in a card room.

The board person
The board person stays at the main podium for the card room and
keeps track of the waiting lists for the tables. If you already know
what limit you want to play, tell him and he’ll either immediately
direct you to a seat or put you on the list. You can sign up for 
multiple different limits and you’ll get called for the first one
that’s open.
If the waiting lists are long but there are still obviously poker
tables that are not being used, don’t despair. Often what a casino
will do is open a new table if it has an idle dealer and enough play-
ers to fill it.
When you get called, the board person will always refer you to a
specific table number. The table numbers are always either on a
placard on the table (next to the chip tray, where the dealer drops
the rake), or hanging from signs above the table. If you can’t find
your seat, ask the floorperson where you should go (see the follow-
ing section for more on the floorperson).
The floorperson
The floorperson (sometimes just called the floor) keeps track of
everything that happens at the card tables. In very small card
rooms, the floorperson and the board person are the same guy.
(Don’t ask me why they all have moustaches.)
The dealer
Yep, it’s exactly who you think it is. The dealer doesn’t play in the
game — she just acts as a card-and-chip distribution mechanism.
If you ever have a problem in a hand, you should always start by
asking the dealer (not the other players at the table). If you don’t
get an answer to your liking, you can always ask for the floorperson.
Sometimes a dealer will give you your chips. Just put your money
on the table and the house personnel will tell you what to do.
The chip runner
This chip runner is the person who takes your cash and gives
you your chips (assuming the chip runner actually works for the
casino — if not, it’s the person who takes your cash and then runs
from security).
The cashier
Also known as the cage, the cashier is the place where you cash
your chips when you go to leave the game. In a large casino, there
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
186

is always a special cashier for the poker room that is separate from
the main game. (If they do have a special cashier, use it — the lines
are always shorter than the main casino’s.)
If something slightly unusual happens — like you win some huge
amount of money, you have an altercation with another player, or
you just want to get a little closer to a man in uniform — you can
always ask the cashier to have security escort you from the card-
room property.
Proposition players, or props
Proposition players — more commonly known as props — are
people who are paid a small hourly rate by the card room to play
in the games. They have to use their own money — wins are theirs
to keep, losses are theirs to bear. Nearly all card rooms have a rule
that props either have to wear identification, or at least be identi-
fied by casino staff when asked.
Being up against a “professional” paid card player may feel a little
daunting at first, but in reality they’re just normal people like
anyone else. My experience with props has been that their games
are very solid but not flamboyant. They can be beaten, just like
anyone else, but they’ll probably be some of the tougher people
you’ll run up against.
Typically, you’ll only find props at short-handed games or starting
up new tables — there’s no reason for the house to play them on
full tables.
As you know, poker is on a huge upsurge (that’s part of the reason
you’re reading this book, after all), and as it grows in popularity,
houses aren’t having to employ as many props. In fact, props are
becoming a bit of a rarity, but they’re still worth asking about if
you’re curious.
Shills
Shills are similar to props except they play with house money and
do not keep their winnings. Because of this, they often play by
what are known as shill rules — a predefined set of rules defining
what they can and cannot do during betting rounds.
Shills are essentially the dinosaurs of the poker rooms and now are
all but extinct. In the last ten years, the only time I’ve seen them is
in games to assure that the bad-beat jackpot conditions are met —
they get dealt a hand and then automatically fold (turn to “Trying
to Score a Jackpot,” later in this chapter, for more on jackpots).
Chapter 16: Harrah’s, Here I Come: Playing in Card Rooms 187

Off-duty employees
Some card rooms allow their employees to play when they aren’t
working their shift. Gaming regulations nearly always require that
these people be badged. Why someone would sit working in a
poker room for eight hours, only to turn around and sit at the
other side of the table is beyond me. My experience has been that
these people are a threat at the higher limits and no problem at all
at the lower limits.
Getting started
When you decide to finally take the dive and play in a professional
card room, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have your cash and a government-issued
photo ID before you enter.
If you need cash and want to save a buck, use an ATM out-
side the casino — casino ATM rates tend to be a little pricey.
Nearly all professional card rooms require that all players
carry an ID in order to play, although you’ll probably never
be asked for it. (I’ve only been asked for mine at very major
tournaments.)
2. Go to the board person to find out the limits the card
house has.
The floorperson will either direct you to a seat or he’ll add
you to a list. (You may ask to be added to multiple lists.)
3. When the floorperson directs you to a seat, tell the floor-
person (or your dealer) how much you would like to buy
in for.
Put your money on the table before you sit down. In some
houses, the dealer will give you your chips, in others the
chip runner will get them for you. Don’t worry about how it
works, though — you’ll be told.
4. If the dealer tells you that you have to post a blind to get
cards, do so.
In some card rooms (those in California, for example), you
must post an amount equal to the big blind, regardless of
position, to get your first hand. In others (like those in
Vegas), you’re dealt in to the hand “for free.”
Theoretically, you’re better off waiting until it’s your turn
to post the big blind (because your automatic posting also
counts as the big blind), but it doesn’t make that much 
difference.
5. Cross your fingers and start playing.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
188

Exploring your possibilities
Here are a few of the things to be aware of while you’re in a card
room. Take advantage of any or all of them.
Picking up a free magazine
Nearly all card houses carry Card Player magazine or the Poker
Player broadsheet. Those publications, and any others you might
see, are free to players (even if they list a cover price). You should
always pick up a copy. The articles tend to be great and sometimes
the very card room you’re playing in will run special promotions
for readers.
Taking a break
Any time you want to take a break from the game, you can just
leave the table with your chips sitting. It’s mildly polite, but not
strictly necessary, to tell the dealer, “Deal me out” before you do.
In some houses — especially extremely busy ones — they’ll put a
clear plastic box over the top of your chips. That lets another player
play from your spot, setting their chips on top (sometimes called
piggybacking). Yes, it’s as weird as it sounds.
The rules for how long you can be gone from your seat vary by
casino. It’s usually about an hour, but be sure to ask a dealer what
the house rule is before you’re gone for an extended time. If you
happen to be gone longer than you should be, your chips are
picked up and can be collected by the floorperson.
Ring-game absence
In a ring game, the dealer will often put a small orange marker in
front of your seat that says something like “Player Absent.” If you
miss a blind they’ll put markers in front of your seat that say
“Missed Small Blind” and “Missed Big Blind.” The dealer will not
deal cards to an absent player’s spot while that person is away
from the table.
When you return, you can either:
 Wait until it’s your big blind. At that point, the dealer will
take all the old markers from you, and you’ll post and play as
normal.
 Rejoin immediately. To do so, you need to pay for the blinds
that you’ve missed. Most likely, you’ll have missed both the
small and large blinds so the big blind acts exactly like an out-
of-position big-blind bet (you’re automatically in the hand),
and the small blind goes into the pot as dead money. Believe
me, no one will argue when you do this.
Chapter 16: Harrah’s, Here I Come: Playing in Card Rooms 189

Tourney absence
In tournaments, the dealer will continue dealing cards to the
vacant seat (which are automatically mucked in turn) and the
absent player is blinded off until he returns. At extremely large
tourneys, the bathrooms tend to fill up heavily during the breaks,
so you may want to consider ducking out a hand early before the
break if things are becoming “urgent.” (There’s always a clock
somewhere to let you know when the next break is due.)
Don’t sweat it if you miss the beginning of a tournament that
you’re signed up for, especially a large one. It takes a long time for
the blinds to become serious — in fact, many pros intentionally
miss the very start of games such as the World Series Main Event
just so they won’t have to compete against the early maniacs who
will be taken out over time.
Switching your seat
If you don’t like the particular seat at your table, you can tell the
dealer that you want to move whenever another player leaves the
table.
If the seat you move to is counterclockwise (toward the blinds),
you may continue playing with no penalty. If the seat you move to
is clockwise (away from the blinds), you’ll have to repost to get a
hand immediately, or wait for the number of hands that equals the
number of positions you moved (this ensures that you’re paying
blinds at the same rate as everyone else at the table).
Changing your table
If the table you’re playing at is just too tough, too grumpy, or you
simply want a better view of the TV, you can ask the floorperson
for a table change. He’ll put you on a list and grant you the change
when a player leaves another table of the same limit.
Chowing on cheap food and grog
Card rooms very often will have bargain (or sometimes even free)
food for the players. Ask any dealer or floorperson for the situation
at the house you’re playing. Often, the attached restaurant will
have a special bargain menu for seated players, complete with
cool little rolling stands to serve you right at the table. Dig that
two times.
In Nevada card rooms, the house will pay for all your drinks.
(And I’m sure all your tablemates will appreciate it if you down
a six-pack while you’re playing.)
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
190

Validating your parking ticket
Some of the parking lots attached to the Nevada casinos have park-
ing that is free if, and only if, you validate your parking. Give your
ticket to the floorperson or dealer — if you’re playing, he’ll validate
you for eternity.
Getting a good room rate
Most card houses attached to hotels have a special rate for poker
players. Ask before you go or ask any floorperson when you’re
there. The strip in Las Vegas is becoming expensive — it’s a good
way to stay cheaper in a town that’s getting more pricey by the day.
Watching your favorite team
Sports — especially sports betting — and poker go hand in hand.
There isn’t a card room in the country that won’t be playing six dif-
ferent sports channels, horse tracks, dog tracks, and sumo-midget
wrestling on some bank of TV monitors within eyesight. Watching
your favorite team is a great way to break from the monotony of
the card tables — or to cool down if things get steamy after too
many beats. You can even have the house hold your seat at the
card table while you do it, if you want.
Avoiding Common Mistakes
New players in card rooms seem to make the same smattering of
mistakes.
All actions at a professional card table are being monitored by the
“eye in the sky.” You want to do everything in such a way that the
surveillance can obviously and clearly see what you’re doing.
Here’s some advice to help you steer clear of the Newbie Rocks.
Betting properly
When you place a bet in a professional card room, put it in front
of you in one movement. If you’re betting more than four chips,
divide things down into stacks that are countable (for example, if
you’re making an $8 bet at a $4/$8 table, bet a stack of four and
another stack of four next to it).
Do not place your bet into the middle pot — even if you did see it
in Rounders. That’s a technique known as splashing and is definitely
uncool.
Chapter 16: Harrah’s, Here I Come: Playing in Card Rooms 191

Playing in turn
The order of play is clockwise, by person. I don’t know what it is
about a card room, but for some reason a lot (if not most) of the
new players try playing out of turn — especially when they have a
hot hand.
The easiest thing to do is to just wait until the person in front of you
acts. If the person in front of you does nothing, you do nothing.
Raising properly
Start by saying “raise” to the dealer. In Limit you now can take your
own sweet time putting the chips out that you want, because it’s
well defined that you have to add one unit amount to the bet. If you
say “raise” to a turn bet at a $3/$6 table, you have to put out $12.
In No-Limit, you should arrange whatever amount you want to
move very close to the rail of the table, and then move the entire
set of chips forward with one motion.
What you want to avoid is what’s known as a string raise: putting
some money into the pot, and then putting out more, in two actions.
Your oral action at a table is binding. If you say “raise,” then you must
raise. Be very careful what you say during the course of a hand — it’s
easy to have a side conversation misunderstood as action in a hand.
Minding your own money
Do not, under any circumstances, touch anyone else’s chips.
Similarly, do not make change for yourself out of the pot if you
don’t have the right chip amount. That means if you’re going to
call a $5 bet and all you have is a $25 chip, say “call” and put the
chip in front of you like a normal bet. The dealer will make sure
you get the proper change.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
192
The one-chip rule
When you’re playing in a professional card room and you throw a single chip out that
is bigger than the bet you need to call — for example, throwing out a $25 chip for a
$2 bet — that bet is considered to be a call and not a raise.
In order to raise with a single chip, you must say raise first, before you place the
chip on the felt.

Playing only your hand
There is a common phrase in card rooms: Only one player to a
hand. This means several things:
 Do not show your hand to other players still in the hand at
the table. Doing so gives an unfair advantage to one player by
giving her additional knowledge of the deck.
 Never give advice to people still in the hand (for example,
“Call that loser!”), and do not take any advice from other
people. Again, this has to do with knowledge of the deck that
not everyone has. If you see this kind of behavior from other
players at the table, feel free to tell your dealer about it 
(actually, your dealer should jump on top of it without your
saying anything). If the dealer is unresponsive, call for the
floorperson.
 Don’t show your cards before you muck them. In general,
this is bad form, but if you do, make sure you show them to
the whole table (or at least everyone who is still in the hand).
Any time you get asked about your hand — or asked for advice —
while the hand is in play (even if your hand is already mucked),
your standard response should be, “We can talk about it as soon as
the hand is over.”
Trying to Score a Jackpot
One of the ways that a few of the brick-and-mortar sites beat the
online world — from a pure cash point of view, at least — is by
offering players money in addition to what is being bet in the hand.
This money is known as a jackpot.
There tend to be a few different kinds of jackpots, and I cover them
in the following sections.
High-hand jackpots
A high-hand jackpot is a bonus amount given to the highest hand in
the card room over a given period of time — typically, something
like four hours, but sometimes as long as a day or a week. You might
be surprised at what it takes to win something like this; over a
period of time as short as four hours, it nearly always will take
quads or better to pull down a jackpot.
Chapter 16: Harrah’s, Here I Come: Playing in Card Rooms 193

Specific-hand jackpots
Similar to high-hand jackpots, some houses pay a bonus for royal
flushes, or, in more liberal cases, jackpots are set for any hand that
is quads or better. In houses with specific jackpots for given hands,
there’s always a large display touting what you could win.
Bad-beat jackpots
This jackpot is the granddaddy of them all. A bad-beat jackpot is
always defined by some ridiculously great hand being beaten by an
even more ridiculously great hand. It’s very common for the rule to
be “quads or better, beaten,” meaning you have to have four-of-a-kind
and then have it beat.
Minting the bad-beat cash
Casinos that have bad-beat jackpots will very often rake an extra
quarter out of every pot for the jackpot. Because the hands involved
are based on such long-shot odds, it takes forever to pay them out.
The resulting jackpots can be massive. (Here’s one example: A card
room that I visit occasionally in Northern California had a bad-beat
jackpot of $85,000 last time I was there.)
Like everything else having to do with the rake, you don’t really
notice the extra quarter leaving the pot. But over time it’s very 
corrosive — and at the lower limits even more so (because 25¢
represents a bigger portion of the total pot).
Paying the bad beat
The payout structure for a bad beat varies from house to house,
but it’s usually something similar to this:
 80 percent to the hand that is bad beat
 10 percent to the winning hand
 10 percent to everyone else who was dealt a hand at the table
In some cases, the payout is even larger and spread to everyone in
the card room. (In fact, my co-author of Winning at Internet Poker
For Dummies, Chris Derossi, received a bad-beat payment for play-
ing poker in the same casino chain that had a bad beat — the table
where it actually happened wasn’t even in the same casino. And
still he took home an extra $400!)
Believe me, if you take down a bad beat, you’ll have friends for life.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
194

Improving your chances
If you want a better shot at winning a bad-beat (or high-hand) 
jackpot, you should change the starting cards you choose from
Chapter 4. Consider playing all pocket pairs and all suited connec-
tors (with no gaps). This strategy makes you more likely to hit
quads (which can beat other quads, or more hopefully, be beaten),
or it gives you a chance to catch a straight flush on one end while
someone else is working the other.
When you’ve hit a bad beat condition (quads or a straight flush),
do not bet your hand. Yes, you want to win the pot, but you want
even more to drag down that jackpot for yourself and you don’t
want some measly bet to scare someone off from making the
single-card draw he needs to win.
Qualifying for jackpots
Okay, this part is super important (if I had a Super Important icon,
I’d repeat it on every bullet below). If you’re going to be eligible
for either high hands or bad beats, you must follow the eligibility
requirements. Casinos tend to be fairly stringent about this (as you
can imagine, they don’t enjoy paying out extra thousands of dollars),
so be sure that you’re playing by the casino’s rules and qualifica-
tions to win:
 You are not allowed to talk about a jackpot during the
progress of a hand. That means you can’t say things like
“Hey man, I’ve got quad sixes! Now someone else beat it!”
 If you’re playing in a card room with a bad-beat jackpot and
you don’t have the minimum number of people (usually six)
at your table, ask the floorperson to waive the rule, or have
the floorperson send a shill over to take a hand. (I’ve never
seen this request refused — often the floorperson will just
take a hand himself and then immediately muck it.)
 In most card rooms, you must use both cards in your hand.
That means if you’re holding A 2 and the flop is 2-2-2, if
your quads are beaten, they do not count toward the jackpot.
 If the pot doesn’t have enough money to qualify (often $10),
but you have a necessary bad-beat hand, hold off on your
betting until the river (assuming the bet and the call will hit
the minimum), so you don’t scare off a drawing opponent.
 Make sure you are dealt in. You can only get paid if you were
physically dealt cards in the hand, not if you were just sitting
there gaping at the wonders of the world.
Chapter 16: Harrah’s, Here I Come: Playing in Card Rooms 195

Houses always have their jackpot rules printed out and in plain
sight. Always ask to see them before you start playing. Nothing in
the bad-beat poker world would be worse than actually hitting
your bad beat but not getting paid because of some freakish wrin-
kle in that particular card room’s rules.

Competing in Tournaments

T
ournaments are an interesting form of the game — more so
now that television focuses almost exclusively on tournaments
and tournament play.
Fifteen years ago, the majority of Hold’em tournaments were Limit
affairs with No-Limit relegated mostly to those who were either
serious or insane. The explosion of televised events has driven
the Limit form of tournaments into the shadows — with the vast
majority of play now being No-Limit.
If you assume tournament play and ring-game play are the same,
you’ll find yourself standing outside the money winner’s circle of
the tourneys you play in — even if you’re a regular ring-game
money winner.
If you have a burning interest in the single-table tournaments you
find online, you’ll find a much more extensive write-up than what I
have in this chapter in my other book, Winning at Internet Poker For
Dummies, which I co-wrote with Chris Derossi (published by Wiley).
Coming to Grips with 
the Differences
In some ways, tournaments are the purest form of Texas Hold’em.
In ring-game play, you can bash heads with a table full of people all
night, come out roughly even, and argue for the following week
about who’s really the best.

In tournaments, prizes are given out in a very specific order. And
yes, you can still argue about who is best, but the tournament
board at the end will definitively display all winners, best to worst.
Nothing quite says, “You lose,” like seeing your name on the bottom.
Time to do the work necessary to get you on top.
Tourney basics
In a tournament, you get a specific and predefined number of
chips. When you lose them all, you’re bust and removed from the
tournament. Man, does that ever hurt.

Getting something for nothing 
with freerolls
A freeroll is the exact spot on the freeway of life that the big rig of the American
Dream crashes into the sexy sports car that is Texas Hold’em (and it’s every bit as
pretty). In freerolls you can, truly, get something for nothing.
In the brick-and-mortar world, you typically see freerolls as a perk to players who
play a certain number of hands, or during specific hours of the day. “Play a total of
20 hours any time during the month and get an entry in our $1,000 freeroll,” that type
of thing. Although qualification isn’t too difficult, the tournaments themselves tend
to be extremely competitive and difficult to win, because they’re filled with card-
room regulars.
In the online world, it’s more common to see freerolls as a come-on to get players
onto the site. Unknown poker sites may get less than a hundred players vying for
something like $100. The very large and well-known sites may get several thousand
players competing over multiple days for the same amount.
Especially in the online case, you should never judge tournament play by what you
see in a freeroll. Because it costs nothing to enter, there’s nothing to lose, and you’ll
see an unbelievable number of plays — such as people calling all-in with nothing
more than an inside straight draw.
From a pure mathematical point of view, freerolls are the best deal going. Nothing
to pay with prizes to win.
From a practical point of view, they’re both maddening because of the amount of
time they take to play and dangerous because you get too much exposure to how
you should not play poker, especially as a beginner.
Play ’em to get a feel for tournaments, and you can keep playin’ ’em if they really turn
your crank, but otherwise you should move into money play to truly sharpen your game.

All tournaments have a unique structure in the form of entry fees
you pay, the chips you get for that money, and the speed at which
those chips will be blinded off.
Entry fees
In the world of tournaments, you pay an entry fee, which goes
directly into the prize pool. On top of this, you fork over a 
registration fee (typically 10 percent of the entry fee), which
goes to the house.
If you see tournaments talked about in writing or online, the entry
fee and registration fee are usually represented by something like
“$50 + $5,” meaning $50 to the prize pool and 5 bucks to the house.
A tournament with no entry fee “$1 + $0” means that all the money
goes directly to the prize pool. From a mathematical point of view,
aside from freerolls (see the nearby sidebar), these are the best
deal going in a poker room because you’re never leaking any
money to the house.
Unless the tournament says something like “+ $0,” “No registration
fee,” or “All monies go to prizes,” you should assume that you’ll
have to pay a registration fee and you need to read the fine print to
find out what it is.
Chip-stack sizes
For your fees, you’re handed a predetermined amount of chips.
The quick, small, and dirty tournaments — like single-table sit-and-
goes online (see Chapter 15 for more on online play) — will typically
start you off with something like 1,000 or 1,500 in chips. Any tour-
naments with starting stacks less than this are called short-stack
tournaments — a peculiar subset of the tourney world where you
have to start improving your stack size almost immediately or
you’ll find yourself scratching your head and wondering what 
happened all too soon from the rail.
Big monster tournaments — like the main event at the World Series
of Poker — may start with stacks of 10,000. These are known as
deep-stack tournaments.
Sometimes tournaments will give you the ability to start with
bonus chips — usually by playing extra time in the same card
room’s ring games. Be sure to find out if the tourney you want to
play in has something like that on offer. As a general rule, the more
chips you can start with, the better off you are.
Chapter 17: Competing in Tournaments 199

Conventional wisdom (correctly) has it that the deeper the stacks
are in a tournament, the more favorable it is to the better players —
the longer you can play, the more the vagaries of luck of the draw
wear off, letting pure skill shine through.
Blind dynamics
In tournaments, the blinds start small and escalate over time.
(See Chapter 3 for blind basics if you’re not familiar with them.)
The exact timing of the escalation depends on the tournament, but
they’re usually based on either a set number of hands (for example,
“blinds increase every ten hands”), or a set time period (“blinds
increase every 15 minutes”). Deep-stack tourneys typically have
slower blind escalation (this, again, favors the better players).
As you can see in my theoretical example in Table 17-1, blinds in
Hold’em tourneys start small but ramp up to the point where they
have a significant influence on the play. And don’t let the end of the
chart fool you, they continue to escalate — as long as there is play
left in the tourney, the blinds continue to march right on up.
Check it out: If you were given 1,000 chips to start in the tourney,
and you lasted 90 minutes, by the table’s schedule, every orbit of
the dealer button at that point would be taking 1,200 chips (small
blind + large blind) — more than you were given to start with.

“Hey, what happened to the ‘$?!’”
Throughout this chapter, you see that I don’t use $ to denote the amount of money
the players have in chips. That’s because, technically, the chips don’t actually rep-
resent dollars (you certainly can’t leave a tournament in the middle and cash them),
it’s just a form of playing scrip that is batted around between players.
In fact, in most tournaments, there’s no correlation between the amount you pay to
play and the stack of chips they hand you. For example, a $10 + $1 online tournament
may hand you something like 1,500 chips.
In professional card rooms, you’ll find the physical poker chips used in ring games,
which represent real money, to be very elaborate. The elaborateness of the chips
makes them not only attractive but also much harder to counterfeit.
These same card rooms may well have an old grungy set of tournament chips, so
worn that their faces are no longer legible and you can identify their value only by
color. Although it’s true that they’re not pretty to look at, all the wear sure makes
’em easy to shuffle with one hand. . . .

Some tourneys also add the concept of an ante (pronounced 
an-tee) after several levels. The ante is a bet that all players are
required to pay every hand before the start of play, but it’s signifi-
cantly less than the blind amounts. For example, at blind levels of
400/800, the ante would be something like 25. You can think of it
like a mini-blind for everyone.
Rebuying and adding on
Some tournaments are single buy-in affairs. You pay a flat amount,
you get a stack of chips, and you play until you lose what you have
or win every chip in the tournament. In others, you’re allowed to get
more chips by rebuying and/or adding on. Read on for more info.
Rebuying
Some tournaments have a feature known as a rebuy. The rules of
when you can rebuy vary a bit (ask your dealer or read the rules for
your tourney), but typically you’re allowed to rebuy any time you dip
below the number of starting chips you’re given in a tournament —
including if you bust out.
You’re only allowed to rebuy before the start of a deal of a hand,
and if you bust out, you must immediately rebuy to be dealt in the
next hand. If you don’t rebuy at that time, you’re out.
It’s worth talking about how rebuys work and when you should
do them.
Chapter 17: Competing in Tournaments 201

The dynamics of rebuys
Sometimes the number of times you can rebuy is limited, but more
commonly, you’re allowed to rebuy as many times as you want
(as long as your current stack is under the starting chip amount),
up until the first tournament break.
A rebuy will typically give you the same amount of starting chips
for the same amount of cash (but this time without a registration
fee). For example, if you were playing in a $20 + $2 tournament and
given 1,500 starting chips, another $20 + $0 will gain you another
1,500 chips. (And don’t squander them this time, okay?)
In tournaments with rebuys, most players plan on rebuying, and
you should give it serious consideration yourself. For this reason, a
$10 + $1 tournament may well end up costing you $31 (the $10 entry,
two rebuys for $10, and the $1 registration fee), so don’t see the
$10 price tag and assume that will carry you through the tourna-
ment. A good rule of thumb is to think that any tournament will
cost you a buy-in and two rebuys.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
202
Breaks and blinds
In tournaments, all players must post their blinds and antes in turn, even if the play-
ers aren’t at the table. This process is known as being blinded off.
In ring games, you’re allowed to leave the table at any time — the blinds just skip over
you when you do. You are, however, required to post any blinds for a round you’ve
missed when you return to the table (you never owe more than one small and large
blind, regardless of how long you were away). In a professional card house, the dealer
will put markers in front of your seat (“Missed small blind,” “Missed big blind,”
“Missed blinds”) indicating that you still owe money for that orbit of the dealer button.
In ring-game play, you can avoid having to pay the blinds for that particular orbit by
sitting out until what would normally be your turn to post the big blind and just start
playing then. Ask your dealer before you leave how long you’re allowed to be gone
from the table — after a certain period of time, the floorperson will pick up your
chips and you have to retrieve them from him or her if you’re playing hooky from the
table for too long.
In extremely busy casinos, they’ll sometimes put a clear plastic box over the absent
player’s chips and let another player sit in the seat with their chips on top of the
clear box. The squatter has to leave when the original owner comes back. Yes, it’s
kind of weird.
All tournaments schedule breaks, so you’re better off waiting to leave the table until
a scheduled break time for the tourney than wandering off mid-round.

To rebuy or not to rebuy?
Rebuying in a tournament is an option exclusive to some multi-
table tournaments. Whether to rebuy depends almost wholly on
what the situation is at your table. In most rebuy tournaments,
people will rebuy (usually several times), so for the most part the
tables tend to hold the same players until rebuys are no longer
available. You can use this table-stability factor to your advantage
and to help make a decision on whether to rebuy.
If you’re at a table with a lot of sloppy play, or folks who are
overeager to continually rebuy as they bust hand after hand,
you’re playing at a table that’s essentially a chip factory, and you
should strongly consider rebuying. In a No-Limit tournament, any
player with especially sloppy play should be thought of as an
unguarded stagecoach waiting for an unscheduled delivery to you.
If, however, you’re at a table that is playing extremely tight, and
especially if there hasn’t been a lot of rebuying at your table, but
there has been at the others (keep an eye and ear open around
you to see what’s happening), you should skip it. As people are
eliminated, and tables are consolidated, you’ll be at too great a disad-
vantage to the chip giants who start getting mixed onto your table.
Adding on
In many rebuy tournaments, you have the option to add on to your
stack at the first break. An add-on typically is for the same dollar
amount as your buy-in, but with get a slight discount on the price
per chip (and you don’t have to pay that annoying registration fee).
So a $20 + 2 rebuy tournament that gave you 1,500 starting chips
might offer you an add-on of something like 2,000 more chips for
another $20 + $0.
Of course, just like with rebuys, you have to know when you
should, and should not, add on.
When adding on makes sense
As you get to the add-on break, look around your table and as
much of the rest of the tournament as you can (very big tourna-
ments will display average chip standings on a large screen in the
casino) to get a feel for your relative stack size. If you’re roughly
even with everyone else, you should definitely add on — nearly all
players will, and you need to keep up with them.
Saving your money by not adding on
If you’re way down, say 25 percent less than the average stack,
adding on isn’t going to give you the firepower you need to advance
(because everyone else will add on as well and you’ll still be down).
You’re better off just holding that money for another day.
Chapter 17: Competing in Tournaments 203

Likewise, if you’ve been striking fear into the hearts of mere mor-
tals during the early part of the tournament and you find you’ll be
way up after the add-on break, say in the top 20 percent of the
tournament, you also should not rebuy. The marginal value from
the extra chips simply doesn’t justify the purchase. Why throw
more money into the purse when you have an extremely good shot
of winning it all right now?
Prize structures
With the exception of the registration fee, all the money you pay
into a tournament goes into the prize pool and is divided unevenly
into prizes.
In single-table tournaments (tourneys that consist of only one table —
you typically will only find these online), the prizes are usually
broken up something close to the following: 50 percent to first
place, 30 percent to second place, 20 percent to third place.
There is a form of single-table tournament found in professional
card rooms known as a satellite. Satellites are qualifying tourna-
ments that win you a seat into a “larger” event and are often used
in cases where entry fees are astronomically high or for special
qualifications. For example, the World Series of Poker Main Event
has a $10,000 entry, but you can play in a satellite for a mere $1,000,
where the winner gets a seat in the main event. (You can even play
in a super satellite, where winning a $100-entry event gets you a
seat in the $1,000 satellite.)
Satellites sometimes have multiple qualifications prizes (for example,
“Top two players get seats in the Main Event of the World Series of
Poker”). In these types of events, it doesn’t matter who finishes
first or second — as long as you’re in the top two, you’re a winner.
Multi-table tournaments will typically pay out prizes to about 10 per-
cent of the places — so a tournament with 250 players will pay
something on the order of 25 prizes. Here, too, the prizes will tend
to be heavily weighted to first place.
In heads-up tournaments (found almost exclusively online, where only
two players are pitted against each other), the winner takes the prize
pool. The loser gets to wonder what’s for dinner. (These tourneys
typically have a 5 percent registration fee rather than 10 percent —
something like $20 + $1.)
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
204

Understanding Your Chip Position
Your chip position is where you stand relative to the rest of the
tournament (for example, first, second, and so on). You should
always think of your chip position in two different ways: your rela-
tive position to the table you’re playing at, and (in multi-tables)
your overall position in the tournament.
Your position at your table
A player’s chip position at the table will often influence her play.
You can expect to see chip leaders (especially if they have over-
whelming chip stacks) bully other players on the table by putting
sizeable raises down, stealing blinds, and otherwise distributing
general forms of misery.
Chapter 17: Competing in Tournaments 205
Why Mike Caro hates tournaments
Mike Caro, the “Mad Genius of Poker,” is one of poker’s foremost theoreticians. He
made a name for himself originally by contributing to the technical portions of the
seminal poker book Super/System and followed that with the definitive work on the
outer psychology of the game, Caro’s Book of Poker Tells. For these reasons alone,
he should be listened to pretty much any time he talks about poker.
And guess what: He hates tournaments.
Mike rightly points out that there is inequity in poker tournaments, essentially saying,
“Why am I given only a portion of the prize pool at the end of a tournament if I’ve won
all the chips?”
From a pure equity point of view, he’s right on. The person who wins all the chips has
essentially given some of his equity away (in the form of prize money) to the other
places along the way. And for this reason, he doesn’t play tourneys.
I’m a math guy, and I play in tournaments. In fact, I consider them to be my spe-
cialty. I like tournaments because of the dynamic and the game theory involved —
I also win more money in the long run in tournament play than ring-game play (prob-
ably because I focus on them more and find them less boring than playing in ring
games for hours on end).
But from a purist’s point of view, Mike’s right. I shouldn’t be playing tourneys.
Good thing I’m not a purist.

Those who are short-stacked, especially those with the very tiny
stacks (say only about five big blinds’ worth of stack or less), will
typically pick a hand they think looks fairly good and push it all-in.
Any time you have a very short stack that is waiting to act behind
you, be aware that person may well act all-in on you. You shouldn’t
consider bluffing these people because when they find a hand they
like, they’re going to push it all-in and they don’t really care what
your betting action has been.
In general, especially early in the tournament, you just want to be
more or less in the middle of the chip standings. Bigger is better
here, of course, but there’s no cause for alarm if you don’t find
yourself rising, or you find yourself moving back a bit in the ranks
from folding hand after hand.
Your position in the tourney 
as a whole
Large multi-table tournaments (and all online ones) will project the
overall tournament standings. Keep a close eye on these listings.
The big figure you want to watch here is the average chip stack.
It really doesn’t matter if there’s some gigantic chip gorilla around
(unless, of course, he’s sitting at your table and raising you all-in
every time you bet). Your aim, at least for the first half of the tour-
nament, is to be no more than 20 percent below that average figure,
because it shows you’re staying with the pack.
The crowd as a whole is too big to move ahead of in the early
phases. You need to wait and bide your time.
Playing Your Way Through
The one thing that makes a tournament unique is the way players
are eliminated. Like the shark that you’re trying to emulate, you
need to keep moving (up in the flow of chips) in order to survive.
Shifting tables
As the tournament advances, people are eliminated and the
remaining players are continually balanced between the remain-
ing tables to make sure the same number of people are sitting
everywhere.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
206

Especially in large multi-table tournaments, the vast majority of
your play will be at full tables, or those with just one player miss-
ing. For this reason, in order to make it to the final table, you need
to master playing at a table that is full.
In order to win the whole thing, you need to come to grips with
playing against a table of competitors that’s shrinking in size.
Maneuvering relative to the herd
You can think of a tournament as having three stages: early, middle
and late.
Getting it on from the start
Early in a tournament, especially in multi-table affairs, your best
strategy is to sit back and get a feel for the other players. Be very
careful to not overplay or over-bet your hands, because to win you
have to survive — and survival isn’t an option if you don’t have
any chips. “Slow and steady” is the rule of the day.
In tournaments that are deeply stacked or have especially large
fields of players, keep an eye out for players that seem antsy or
anxious. These types of tournaments take forever to play, and if
you have an opponent who’s showing open signs of wanting things
to move along, almost certainly he’ll make a bad, aggressive move
at some point. Although they’re dangerous to play against, in early
and middle stages you’ll find that a disproportionate share of your
chips come from these jitterbugs.
If you find yourself with a nut hand, make sure not to over-bet it.
You’re better off winning a small pot than making a large bet that
isn’t called, because you’ll need those chips later — it will also give
you a reputation at the table for being someone who plays very
solidly and tends to under-raise. This rep will be helpful if and
when you try to pull off a bluff later.
The golden rule of any gaming situation is to maximize your wins
and minimize your losses. In the early rounds of a tourney, you
maximize your wins by making sure winning bets are called and
readily folding on hands that seem uncertain or a little too dear.
In the early stages, if you see a player make an obvious or taunting
bluff (like showing his cards when he’s bluffed a small pot), just
ignore this behavior. When tournaments are getting started, espe-
cially when the blinds are still tiny relative to the table stacks, 
players commonly try to establish a table image that is essentially a
lie, with the idea of exploiting it later. This trick tends to be far more
common at low-entry fee tournaments and freerolls. Don’t fall for it.
Chapter 17: Competing in Tournaments 207

Muddling through the middle
When the tournament has lost about a third of its players, it begins
to change its character. You’ll notice that the madmen, the misfits,
and the terminally impatient are starting to get culled out, leaving
a more calculating and quiet type of player in the tournament.
Blinds may start coming into play at this point, and you need to
keep your eye on that 10-to-1 ratio.
You want to start getting just a tad more aggressive with your bet-
ting and still be quick to drop marginal hands — especially when
multiple players are competing for the same pot.
From the middle of a tournament forward, make sure that any time
you bring in the betting on a pot pre-flop, you raise for at least
three times the big blind. You don’t want to let anyone at the table,
including the big blind, see cards “for free.” (This includes if you’re
playing on the big blind and the table folds to the small blind, and
the small blind merely calls your big blind. Again, if you’re going to
play the hand, and you have good cards, you should raise the
small blind to at least three times the bet.)
Watching your stack relative to the blinds
There are two key moments in playing a tournament: when your
stack is roughly equal to about ten big blinds, and when your stack
is less than five big blinds.
The 10-to-1 rule for your tourney play
Throughout a tournament, keep an eye on the size of your stack
as a multiple of the number of big blinds. For example, when you
have 1,000 starting chips, and the starting big blind is 20, you have
50 times the number of big blinds.
Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a math wizard — you’re really
only worried about one multiple: 10-to-1. Take the big blind and
multiply it by 10. If you have more than that in chips, you’re fine.
If you don’t have more than that, especially if you’re still a fair way
out from winning a prize, you need to tighten up your play and get
more aggressive when you do bet. You’re behind and need to raise
your chip count.
As you make this adjustment, the table will probably notice your
play becoming more aggressive and may assume that you’re pan-
icking (and, in turn, bluffing). By tightening what you play as you
get more aggressive, those people who do call you are more likely
to fall, and this is the very trick you’ll use to help climb back out of
the hole.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
208

The 5-to-1 rule for your tourney play
You should think of this as the fraternal twin of the 10-to-1 rule.
Take the big blind and multiply it by 5. If your stack is smaller
than that, you’re in a situation known in poker slang as “big frickin’
trouble.”
At this point, your stack won’t be enough of a threat to make
anyone back off when you push all-in, so don’t even think about
bluffing. Instead, find a hand you like and push it hard (maybe 
all-in pre-flop).
Worthy hands for playing to the hilt:
 Any Ace with a complimentary suited card
 Any pocket pair 8 or greater
 Any two cards 10 or greater
Fold anything else. You want that one shot to be a good one.
If you find yourself in a blind and you’ve seen a flop for free, push
all-in if you have the semi-bluff hands of four cards to a straight or
four cards to a flush (see Chapter 9 for more on semi-bluffs); or if
you’ve managed to make a pair with the board. Don’t forget to pray
lots when you do.
Going for the gold at the end
As the field is winnowed down, you’ll find the play getting tougher
and tougher. Betting will be more aggressive and blinds will become
a serious threat to your stack.
Also, for the first time in the tourney, you’ll start playing on short-
handed tables. If you played in a tournament with 1,000 players
and only 11 are left (way to go, you’re in the money!), assuming
there are 10 seats to a table there’ll be 6 players on one table and
5 at the other.
No matter where you’re seated, this will be the first time in the
tourney that you’ve played against this few players. That means
you need to start playing a little more loose because:
 The blinds will be coming around on top of you more frequently
(and they’ll be huge).
 With fewer players at the table, you don’t need as strong of a
hand to win a pot.
Chapter 17: Competing in Tournaments 209

Seating adjustments
Throughout the tournament, players (including yourself) will be
moved from table to table to keep the number of players at each
table balanced. If you get transferred, make sure to get a good feel
for the sizes of the chip stacks around the table relative to your
position.
Make sure to keep your eyes open for new players arriving at your
table. In brick-and-mortar card rooms, noticing new players is
easy to do because confusing the biker who just sat down with the
grandma who just got eliminated isn’t likely. But online, sometimes
it’s just a name placard change and it’s easy to overlook.
Each player has a different stack size and a different playing style —
watch each new player and find out all you can. Ignore new players
at the risk of your stack.
Bursting the bubble
The bubble is the spot in a tournament where the losers stop
and the money starts. For example, if there are 19 players left 
in a tournament that pays 18 spots, the tournament is said to be
on the bubble.
Bubble play is interesting because nearly all players tighten up
approaching that moment. And no wonder — it’s possible they’ve
been playing for hours (or in the super-huge tournaments, days),
and they want to get paid.
The bubble can be a prime time to get a little more aggressive.
Blind stealing is easier near the bubble than any other time in a
tournament. Raise when you have a good opening hand and get a
little more aggressive with the opening hands you’ll play in later
position (especially if the table has folded to you). You don’t have
to collect many sets of blinds before it’s the equivalent of winning
a fairly large pot.
When most tournaments near the bubble, they drop into hand-for-
hand play. All tables must wait until the hand is finished everywhere
in the tournament before the next hand is dealt. This keeps the ter-
minally low-stacked from just sitting, sitting, sitting until someone
else gets eliminated, so they’re not forced to choke down a debili-
tating blind.
Part IV: Places to Play Hold’em 
210

After the bubble has burst, you’ll find that players loosen up and
start playing more hands. This is a good time for you to tighten up
your play — not only because every step on the prize ladder can
mean considerably more dough but also because there may well
be a few steaming people at the table that would like to get even
for your little blind-stealing stunts just before the bubble.
Let the people with high testosterone counts slug it out — play
your cards when you have good ones, or obvious opportunities
present themselves.
Adjusting Your Play for Prizes
All right! You’ve made it so far that you actually have to worry
about money.
Keeping your eyes on the prize
If you’ve played an extremely long tournament, losing track of
what’s going on, either relative to your hand or relative to the 
position, can be easy to do.
Make sure to remember what you’re playing for and the relative
importance of your stack to it. In a tournament, even one chip can
make you eligible for a prize. Zero chips always qualifies you for
the rail.
Splitting the prize money
If you play a tourney all the way to the prizes, it’s not unusual to
see someone offer you a deal (an offer to split the prize money
with you). 
For example, you might play in a tournament where top prize is
$45,000 and second is $27,000 (that’s $72,000 in prizes total).
You and another player are evenly stacked, and the other player
offers to split for $36,000 each. Basically, it’s a lot of money and
the other fellow just wants to be assured of some bucks.
Whether or not you split prizes is entirely up to the players in the
tournament. Brick-and-mortar card rooms will always enforce a
split if asked to do so by the players (and those requests are
common enough that they won’t be surprised if you ask for one).
Most of the top online sites will split prizes as well.

What happens when you 
don’t pay attention
I’ll give you an example from my past that ranks right up there with the most humil-
iating things I’ve ever done on a poker table.
I had been playing online for six hours in a qualifier where the top two players
would win seats to the Main Event in the World Series of Poker. After fighting
through a field of thousands of players it was down to the last three players:
myself with 225,000, Tiny Tim with 10,000, and Action Monkey with 235,000.
I was on the dealer button, Tiny Tim had a 2,000 small blind and the Monkey was
on a 4,000 big blind. I was dealt A-A and brought in the action at 12,000, hoping to
maybe catch the little one.
No luck. Tiny Tim immediately folded. The Action Monkey paused and then pushed
all-in.
Now, the Action Monkey was a guy whom I’d grown to hate over the course of
the game. I’d been unfortunate enough to be forced to sit with him for about three
of the hours I’d played. He was loudmouthed and rude, but worse, he was an
extremely good poker player. I had to make a repeated conscious effort to avoid
him and his great play.
But this was sweet. I had the best starting hand and I could clock him dead right
now. Without thinking twice I called.
He had an off-suit A-K and proceeded to flop K-K-7. I never caught up to his trip
Kings. I was eliminated (he openly taunted me, of course) and he and Tiny Tim got
their all-expense-paid ticket to Vegas. I got to chew on my hand.
Is it a bad beat? Sure. But it’s also a serious error on my part.
The big mistake I made was not keeping my eyes on the prize. Two players qual-
ify, and the order doesn’t matter. Even though I had A-A, a heavy favorite to nearly
any hand, it’s not a certain winner. In just a few orbits of the button, Tiny Tim would
have been forced all-in — if both the Action Monkey and I had called his all-in,
and then didn’t bet against each other, he would’ve had to beat two hands. (And
even if he pulled this off, he would’ve had to do it again. And again. And again.)
No matter what the Monkey had, my odds of getting the trip were better by just
folding and waiting for Tiny Tim to get blinded off or forced to play out of a very
bad situation.
I still don’t like to think about this hand. Don’t let it happen to you.

Although I’m never the first person to offer a split, I’ve always been
mildly in favor of taking it because it gets me some prize amount
that’s above the lowest left in the prize ladder and just generally
sends a shot of good karma to the players you do it with.
I’ve passed on offers to split, always either in cases with players
I’ve disliked for what I considered general ungentlemanly behavior
(in my experience it’s always been men and never women who act
like beasts at a card table), or if I felt I was just flat-out better than
they were.
Here are some factors to consider before splitting:
 Your level of fatigue or how pressed you are for time: If you
feel really tired, you should seriously consider splitting.
 The general poker skills of the people offering to split: If you
think your opponents are considerably better than you, you
should do it. If you feel your abilities are above theirs, play on
(but just make certain in the pit of your soul that you can
accept a bad beat if it happens).
 The mathematical fairness of the offer: Prize money should
be split roughly according to the chip stacks of the various
players. Don’t accept an offer that is grossly out of step to
where your relative chip standing is. Having said that, don’t
sweat tiny discrepancies — for example, if you have 250,000
and two other people have 240,000 in chips it seems overly
picky to insist on something more clever than a flat three-way
split if you’re offered it.
 The likelihood of running across your opponents again:
Refusing a reasonable and equitable split will be mildly
frowned upon. You’ll get minor bad attitude from anyone
whom you refuse. At a local card room, this may not be the
kind of attention you want.
 Taxes: According to the U.S. government, as well as any state
you live in, you must report your poker winnings as income
(you usually can write off losses against those winnings — ask
a tax professional for more information). In some states, they
immediately take taxes for prizes above a certain dollar figure.
You may be able to avoid immediate confiscation with a split
that doesn’t lap over the top of whatever this magic tax number
is. Ask your floorperson — he’ll know what that figure is.

Ten Differences between
Online and Real-World Play
In This Chapter
 Understanding the difference between being there and not
 Adapting to speed differences
 Differentiating between the “pure” game and the “practical” game
O
nline and brick-and-mortar play are different enough that
mastery of one doesn’t necessarily mean success in another.
The rules are the same, yes, but the differences between the two
games are enough to turn a normal winner in one situation into a
loser in the other — if you aren’t careful.
In this chapter, I focus on switching from one version of the game to
the other. I’m assuming you’re comfortable with the game being
played in one venue, but not as much in the other.
If you’re completely new to Hold’em in all forms, you can save this
as an intellectual morsel for later. Hey, you paid good money for
this book — it’s my duty to let you get your money’s worth a little
farther down the road, right?
Not Telling in Live Action
By far the most common mistake I see online players make when
they play in the brick-and-mortar world is physical tells. The worst
are those people who simply have no poker face — you can almost
see what cards they’re holding, just by their expression. Only slightly
better are those who automatically drop into acting exactly oppo-
site of the way that their hands are.

The opening days of the World Series Main Event are a true 
spectacle — not only for the sheer size, but for how truly bad
some of the online players are in handling live action. I can only
imagine what it must be like being a pro and looking at all those
$10,000 entry fees sitting with all those people who have never
actually handled a clay poker chip.
If you’re new to live action, you should go back and have a look at
Chapter 8 for more about tells, and think about the way people will
try to read you.
Adjusting to Speed
The differences go both ways here:
 If you come from the real world, online play can be dizzy-
ingly fast at first. It’s worth playing with free chips for a while,
not to sharpen your poker expertise (you won’t — free-chip
play will do nothing but damage your poker theory), but to get
used to the way the controls work and the raw speed involved.
When you start playing for real money, keep your other com-
puter distractions to a minimum (no e-mail or insane BitTorrent
work) and buy in for half your normal amount. That way if you
lose, you’re losing half as much — but if you win, you’re still
winning.
 When you come out of the online world — especially if
you’re a crazy two-fisted player — live action will seem slow
at a level that is beyond painful. The biggest problem you’ll
have is keeping your mind from wandering as you chant,
“Okay, I’ve folded, where’s the next hand,” under your breath.
Because of this, here too, you should play half the limits you’re
used to, just to make sure you’re not leaking money like a
sieve due to your own personal form of molasses insanity.
If you’re finding live action just too hard to concentrate on,
but you still want to play, consider taking a book or newspa-
per with you to the tables. It’ll give you something to focus on
as time passes.
Understanding Position
One of the great things about online poker is that it gives you
a deeper understanding of what it means to play positionally.
Because you aren’t being inundated with real-world ticks and
tells, you get a “purer” view of the game.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
218

My pal Konstantin Othmer, author of the superb (but hard-to-find)
Seven Card Stud Poker, said that more than anything, online poker
has taught him the importance of position. This, in turn, has given
him insight into how to incorporate those concepts into his bluff-
ing strategies.
If you’re a big fan of live action, you should dabble a little in the
online world — even if it’s just at low limits — to get a better feel
for what Kon means.
Taking Up Space
If you play online all the time, and then venture into the real world,
you may be surprised by how cramped the quarters are. You sit
remarkably close to a lot of people for a long time — that in itself
may put you off playing live.
If you feel cramped, there’s an easy way to check if you’re not 
getting the space you deserve. Look at the dealer, and then look
straight across. In a nine-seat table, Player 5 should be immedi-
ately across; in a ten-seat table, the dealer should perfectly split
Player 5 and Player 6. Divide up the rest evenly from there.
Lighting varies widely in brick-and-mortar card rooms. Make sure
you have lighting you like — if you don’t, ask for a seat change.
Getting at Your Cash
In the online world it typically takes a little while to get set up and
going. To get your money into the poker site, you have to go through
a third-party holding company (similar to PayPal) and sometimes
it can take a couple of days to clear.
Getting your money out can take time, too. First, it has to be
okayed by the site, and then it has to be transferred from your
holding company. Simply put, it all takes a while.
In a physical card room, you bring in cash, you play, and when
you’re done, you walk out with what you have (with any luck,
more than you came in with).
The advantage of the online world is it truly forces you to put aside
some gambling stake and leave it in one place. It’s clearly earmarked
for poker and poker only. But the vast majority of people never bring
that money back out, so it can languish — and money that just sits
around anywhere has a strange habit of eventually going away.
Chapter 18: Ten Differences between Online and Real-World Play 219

Becoming “Serious” 
in the Real World
Playing poker in the real world is more of an ordeal than playing
online. You have to pick up and go with the express purpose of
playing poker. It’s why you’re reading this book, it’s why you left
the safe confines of your house, and it’s why you wait for an hour
ogling at the cute dealers while you’re waiting for a seat.
Because of this, both the competition and the environment are
more focused on card playing. This is a good thing, because it
really gets you thinking “poker” — of course, the disadvantage is
that it focuses your opponents as well.
Although I don’t have any strong numbers to back it up, to me
online opponents have always seemed a little sloppier because
they have more distractions both wherever their computers are,
and on the computers themselves (not to mention playing multiple
tables at once).
Nothing will sharpen your play like live action, but your bankroll
may appreciate the online world more.
Adding Up Online Mathematics
Mathematics is more important to online play than it is in the
brick-and-mortar world. Because you see fewer indications of what
your opponents are thinking or doing, the game comes at you in a
somewhat “purer” form. This means that math will play a bigger
role online. (Turn to Chapter 22 for a reference on a good online
poker-odds calculator.)
But don’t let that keep you from using math in the real world, too.
You should absolutely understand pot odds (see Chapter 12).
And any time you run across a hand in live action that you wonder
about, jot it down on a cocktail napkin and go run the numbers
the next time you’re around a computer.
Tipping the Dealer
Don’t forget, in live action it’s customary to tip the dealer a buck or
two when you win a hand. (They typically get paid minimum wage
and live off their tips.) Don’t worry about tipping when you’ve only
won the blinds — nobody expects that.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
220

Changing Your Venue
In the online world, the next card room is just one click away; in
the real world, it may be miles.
Because of this reality, you should take advantage of changing tables,
or even card rooms, online much more frequently. Don’t forget:
If you’re playing at a table that’s too much for you, you can always
move to another one online.
In the brick-and-mortar world, if you find yourself struggling, you
should just call it a night. You can always find another game some
other time (unless you don’t have any money to play in it).
Keeping Track of Your Online Cash
In the real world, keeping track of your poker money is easy: It’s
either whatever’s written in your ledger (see Chapter 22), or it’s
what’s in your jeans pocket that day.
In the online world, you can easily lose track of your money. First,
you move some money into your transfer agent (for example,
NETeller), and then you move it to the site you play. If you’re play-
ing multiple sites, you may have multiple accounts, and as you
move money back and forth through your transfer agent, you may
leave some bread crumbs there as well.
Every month or so, if you’re playing multiple sites, drive around
and be sure you know where your cash is. This gives you the abil-
ity to check out any new promotions, helps you get a feel for what
the play is like at varying sites, and most importantly, lets you keep
track of where your money is.
Poker sites make enough money — they don’t need to be picking
up your orphaned currency as well.

Chapter 19
Ten (Or So) Common
Mistakes
In This Chapter
 Watching yourself physically
 Keeping track of your mental state
 Trying not to get ground up by mathematics
E
verybody makes mistakes as they play cards. The wise learn
and get better. The rest pull out another bill and feed every-
one else at the table.
Playing Too Many 
Starting Hands
This is, by far, the biggest mistake that beginning and intermediate
Hold’em players make. Sometimes there’s a sense of passion
behind it: like being on a losing streak so you start steaming and
play more hands; or maybe you’re on a winning streak and just
want to rack up even more chips. There may even be a vendetta
involved — you hate that idiot at the end of the table, so you start
playing whenever you can to beat him.
Whatever the reason, the more hands you play, the more money
you’re putting on the table. And this ultimately means that you
need to win more (or bigger) hands. The law of averages will
tell you that you will hit your limit of how much you should
expect to win way before you play a huge number of starting
hands.

If you start getting desperate, don’t play so many hands. Instead,
concentrate on putting more firepower behind the hands that are
legitimately good.
Playing Tired
Don’t underestimate the raw toll that fatigue takes on your game.
Poker — especially in professional card rooms — can put you in
this strange zombielike state where you play for hours on end.
If you find that you’re having trouble thinking about anything
inside or outside of the game, you’re too tired. Stop and play later.
There’s always another game somewhere at some other time.
Playing Too Low or Too High 
of a Limit
If you play too low of a limit, your currency is just going to feel like
play money. You don’t need to bet so much that you feel a sting
when you lose, but the money should make a difference to you —
or you can at least understand what it means.
If you play too high of a limit, you threaten your bankroll (see
Chapter 3 for more on that).
Coin-Flipping Too Often 
in Tournaments
The problem with pushing all-in and repeatedly coin-flipping is that
every one of those plays is roughly a 50/50 proposition. Just like
you can only call a coin the right way so many times before you
miss, there is a limit to how many times you can push all-in and hit
your side.
Over the long haul, repeatedly pushing all-in in coin-flip situations
(especially if you have smaller pairs) is a guaranteed way to keep
yourself away from making the money.
If you aren’t familiar with the concept of coin-flipping in a tourna-
ment, turn back to Chapter 12.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
224

Ignoring What You Know about
Players at Your Table
You should be keeping a close eye on all your opponents (see
Chapter 8 for more on that) and as you do, you’ll pick up tricks,
hints, and characteristics about them.
If you know something about an opponent that’s warning you that
the hand you have is a loser, you should fold. Make sure to con-
sider any or all of the following:
 The way he is betting in a given situation
 The types of cards he tends to play at his current table position
 The way the board will interact with the cards he tends to play
Yes, it’s hard to drop a good hand, but I always find that it’s
much harder watching my money walk over and sit in front of
someone else.
Becoming Impatient
I see something along these lines happen repeatedly at card tables:
In Limit games when a player goes card dead, he may sit for sev-
eral orbits before he plays a hand. This makes the little demon on
his shoulder say something like, “Hey man, you’re here to play
poker not to watch everyone else play,” and the next thing you
know he’s in a hand that he shouldn’t be playing.
In tournaments, the impatient spell often begins when someone
loses a couple of fairly big hands — maybe even as much as 80 per-
cent of her stack. This puts her into heavy-duty fight mode and the
next time she sees any hand of value (even something as weak as
gapped-suited connectors), she just pushes all-in. The problem
with doing this is twofold:
 Being short-stacked makes you easy to be called.
 If you are called, you’re probably dominated.
You don’t have to panic and start pushing all-in all the time until
you have less than five big blinds in your stack. And even then you
should only pick a hand of value.
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Common Mistakes 225

There’s an added impatience problem these days, too, and that is
that a lot of players learn and play on the Internet where games are
extremely fast (possibly even upping their speed quotient by play-
ing turbo versions or multiple games simultaneously). When they
fall into the brick-and-mortar world, it feels like playing in a swim-
ming pool filled with molasses to them. Action, action, action is
what they want, want, want.
Don’t always try to make the big plays happen. Let the cards come
to you first.
Staying Too Long in a Tough Game
You are not the best poker player in the world and you probably
never will be. When you buy that, it shouldn’t take you too long to
agree that some of the better players in the world may be sitting at
your very poker table.
If you’re up against a hard table, or a particularly bad combination
of players, find a better game. In a professional card room, you can
always ask for a table change (it won’t weird them out — people do
this all the time); online you can always just click on another table
(or go to another site). If you’re playing at a single-table joint, just
pack it in for the day.
Losses are hard on your bankroll as well as your poker playing self-
esteem. Don’t torture yourself.
Letting Your Emotions 
Get the Best of You
Q: How can you make a bad beat even worse?
A: By letting it get the best of you psychologically, going on tilt, and
destroying your bankroll hand after hand.
Yes, you will lose poker hands by someone drawing their highly
unlikely outs. Yes, someone will call with some hand he should
have dropped and flop some monster five-card hand. It can, does,
and will happen. (And no, it doesn’t mean the online poker site
you’re playing at is rigged.)
Part V: The Part of Tens 
226

When you hit a big loser like that, you have to psychologically let
it go. A bad beat is hard enough on your bankroll for that single
hand; don’t let it carry you through the rest of a session.
If you don’t have the personality that will let you just shrug it off
and play the next hand, just take a quick walk around the card
room. It’ll help you adjust and deal with what’s happened, and then
you can sit back down, settle back down, and play your best game.
Treating Your Internet
Money Like It’s Fake
When you buy in online, you lose the association you have with
your money. It’s very different from a brick-and-mortar card room
where you pull out a roll of greenbacks and hand ’em over. In the
online world, you fill out a couple of electronic forms, type in a
couple of passwords and you’re off and running.
Lose a little here? No problem. Buy in again over there? “Sure, why
not, I already transferred the money from my bank account anyway.”
Stop.
That money you’re playing is real, honest-to-goodness cash that
could be going to taking your sweetheart out to dinner, buying you
that jacket you always wanted, or investing for the down payment
on a house. The moment you get cavalier about the cash you
spend online is the very point that your bankroll gets in danger.
Go back and have another gander at Chapter 3 to see what your
bankroll should be if you’re planning to play — and win — online.

Ten Ways to Improve 
Your Home Game
In This Chapter
 Picking the right environment
 Getting the good gear
 Living large
You don’t need a pair of ruby slippers to know that there’s
no place like home. Home is not only where your heart is,
it’s also the roost for all your tunes and the haunt of your sig-
nificant other (assuming he or she is still talking to you after 
all the poker you’ve been playing). Home games mean that you
get to see your pals and you don’t have to get chewed up by
the rake.
If you’re considering blowing some cash over a card table anyway,
you may as well pony up a little bit for the game itself. If you have
a bunch of pals who are regulars, you can all chip in — just a few
bucks each can get you a nice setup.
Upgrading Your Deck
By far the best thing you can do for your game is getting rid of
those wax-and-cardboard playing cards and moving to a deck made
entirely of plastic. This is what casinos use at their poker tables
and you should, too. All plastic cards last longer, are less prone to
warping, and are even washable (for when your Cheetos fingers
stain the cards orange). There are several brands, and I’ve played
’em all — by far my favorites are Kems.

Paying $30 for a setup of two decks may make you gasp, but believe
me, you play one night with these babies and you’ll wonder why
you ever played with anything else.
All plastics have an odd form of fragility and that is that they’re
prone to cracking if you play them on a hard surface. If you play on
something like a kitchen table, put a doubled-up sheet or a blanket
down first. Your deck will last longer. (Oh yeah, and don’t leave
them sitting in the sun either.)
Chipping Up
One of the great things about the poker boom is that you can buy
complete poker-chip setups for a home game in a nearly infinite
number of places. Top-of-the-line poker chips are made of clay
(this is what casinos use) and come in a cool aluminum case.
Sets will usually also include a dealer button (and maybe blind
and kill buttons).
The best chips are known as clay composite and are weighed by the
gram (heavier is better). A nice 15-gram set will run you around
$75; 11.5 grams (which are very playable and nice if you’ve been
using bingo markers up until now) run around $40.
Chowing Down
Come on, if you’re gonna take the time to get together with your
friends, you need to upgrade your food and grog. Seriously, get out
of the generic aisle of your grocery store and quit serving that beer
you stole from your parents in the ’80s. If money is an object, have
your pals chip in and bring something.
Poker/barbecue is a surprisingly good combo. Ordering (good)
pizza is never wrong.
Lighting Up
Before you host a game, set up the table the way want to use it,
complete with chairs. Deal a hand around to every spot, and then
play your own version of musical chairs, where you sit in each seat
looking at hole cards to check out the lighting.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
230

I’ve played at a lot of home games that have been heavily lit from
above, but there isn’t enough other ambient light to see the hole
cards. An extra lamp here and there will make all the difference.
Venting It All
Home games get hot. Be sure you’re playing in a place that has air-
conditioning or windows that you can throw open to vent nicely
(even more necessary if you’re having a poker smoker and all the
players are breaking out the stogies).
Your basement may seem like a cool place most of your life, but put
ten sweaty bodies in there, and stir in a few bad beats, and the walls
will be sweating in no time. Your living room or the kitchen are prob-
ably better choices if you don’t have good ventilation downstairs.
Trashing the Place
The amount of raw waste that can be spawned by a poker game
is truly amazing. (In fact, it seems like the quality of the game and
the amount of garbage it generates are directly proportional.)
Trash bags: Buy ’em, use ’em, leave ’em lying around while the
game is in play.
Wiping Out the Badness
You want a wet washcloth, a towel, and maybe even a set of baby
wipes, at the ready. Card tables and spilled drinks go together like
kids around your car’s fresh paint job — leave the two together
long enough and you know there’s going to be trouble.
Be ready in advance, catch it when it happens. (And don’t forget,
you can always use the towel for those really bad beats — for
chewing on or crying into.)
Standardizing Chairs
Home games tend to have a problem in that not all the chairs are
the same, almost always forcing a few players to crane their necks
as they play.
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Improve Your Home Game 231

If you’re going to start playing a lot, it’s worth the time and effort to
go out and get a set of common chairs for the table so everyone’s
sitting in the same thing. Foldables work well (especially with
cushions). The funky, college-student-budget alternative is to buy
white plastic patio furniture.
When you get poker chairs, you want ones without arms — this lets
you pack people in closer at the table (everyone rests his arms on
the table anyway).
Getting Tabled
A folding card table is a great buy because it gives you the soft sur-
face you need for your all-plastic cards and you can store it away
when you’re not pretending to be a budding poker professional.
You can put two bridge tables end to end. Good ones will run you
about $100 each.
If you want to get even more serious, you could think about buying
a table that is professionally padded and liquid resistant with a low-
friction surface (in the casino world, this is known as speed-cloth).
One with built-in drink holders and detachable legs makes more
sense, unless you want to just dedicate an area to poker in an extra
room or basement. To get a feel for the type of table I’m talking
about, you can see excellent examples at www.bvpokertables.com.
A nice, and somewhat custom, table of this caliber will run between
$500 and $1,000, depending on the bells and whistles you want on it.
Renting Your Game
Sounds crazy, yes, but you can hire anything and everything for a
poker game. If you’re going to get serious about it all, or maybe
want to set up a poker night for your school or work, the things
that you can get are only limited by your pocketbook. From the
little to the big, here goes:
 A table and chairs: Keeps you from having to use grandma’s
rocker at the poker table and is an excellent way to try stuff
you’re considering buying later. These can be had for some-
thing on the order of a buck apiece a night.
 A professional dealer: A game goes more smoothly with a pro
dealer, and it lets you focus more on the game. Typically, you
can get one for anything from $15 to $35 an hour.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
232

 The whole shebang: If you live near any large metropolitan
area, you can find entertainment companies that specialize in
poker events. They have dealers, tables, and complete poker
setups. Good setups run on the order of about $50 an hour,
complete with speaking dealer (who may or may not be cute).
 Maybe even a casino: The ultimate home game is to leave
your home altogether and take everyone to your local card
room (or better yet, really knock yourselves out and fly every-
one to Vegas). Get the staff to set up a private table and room
for you — it’s remarkably easy to do and most places don’t
charge that much (because they don’t have to do anything
much out of the ordinary). Call your favorite card room for
rates, and don’t be too surprised if the response is, “All you
have to do is pay the rake.”

Ten Bad Beats
In This Chapter
 Taking a beating from chance
 When bad play gets rewarded
 Looking for a silver lining
O
ne of the ways to tell the lesser mortals from the greater ones
at a poker table is to listen to who moans the loudest about
being bad beaten. Bad beats are a part of all poker games, but they
scream at you a bit louder in Hold’em (especially in No-Limit)
because of the dynamic of the action. Unfortunately for your ears,
not everyone understands this dynamic.
I’ve listed the following ten beats to help console you in your times
of pain — or at least let you know that other people in the world
are crying with you.
Red versus Spudnut
Might as well start the list with one that happened to me as I was
writing this book.
I’d been playing in an online tournament for four hours, there were
135 people left, and the payouts started at 99. I was sitting in the
top 15, and with a top prize of $45,000, my mouth was starting to
water.
On the small blind, I was dealt A K, only one player was in —
a guy (I’ll call him Spudnut) who I felt had been playing way too
loose and had flat-called with a hand under the gun. He was 17th in
the tourney, just slightly below me. I gave him a 5x raise, which he
readily called.

The flop was K 10 4. With first action, I put down a pot-sized
bet, which he readily called. A call here is both interesting and
important: Any time he had a good hand, he was raising; any time
he was behind (or thought he was behind), he called. The Spudnut
had never slow-played a hand. I have to be ahead — top pair, top
kicker, looks good.
The turn is a 7. I push all-in — it’s about half of a pot-size bet.
Spudnut waits, waits, and calls.
He’s holding A J. Unbelievably, he’s called all the way through
without a pair or even a flush draw. All he has is a gut-shot straight,
which he summarily hits. My stack is damaged enough that I can’t
even take the next set of blinds.
Woman Beaten by Madness
In 1995 Barbara Enright became the only woman to ever have
made the final table of the World Series Main Event. On the big
blind with five players left (and a fairly large stack), Barbara was
dealt pocket 8s. Brent Carter was dealt a 6-3 on the small blind and
limped in, getting an immediate all-in push from Brenda.
For reasons still not completely clear in this galaxy, he called
and flopped both a 6 and a 3 — winning a hand that had been a
15-85 underdog.
Hellmuth Yanks His Hair Out
At the World Series in 2002, bad boy Phil Hellmuth was dealt A K
and quickly double-raised Robert Varkonyi holding Q 10.
Varkonyi pushed all-in, Hellmuth went into the tank and finally
called. Varkonyi hit a pair; Hellmuth didn’t and was sent to the rail.
Fuming, Hellmuth later stated on TV that he would shave his head
if Varkonyi won the event. Varkonyi did (his final hand was another
Q-10) and Hellmuth became Mr. Clean.
Nuts about Flushes
A friend of mine, Dr. Diamonds, was playing in a No-Limit ring game
online. He was dealt K 5 on the big blind and with three other
players in, he checked.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
236

The flop was 10 6 9, and the Dr. bet the pot with his second-
nut flush draw. One person passed, the other two (both of whom
had been playing fairly loose), called.
A J on the turn gave my pal the second nut flush and, surprisingly,
both people called. One held the indescribably bad Q-J off-suit
(calling with only top pair and a straight draw); the other held 
Q 7 for the third nut flush — it was third nut until the river
of 8 gave the other player his one-outer and a straight flush.
Moneymaker
Chris Moneymaker was up against Costa Rican Humberto Brenes in
the 2003 Main Event of the World Series. The action pre-flop hadn’t
been too hostile when a flop of K-9-2 hit. Brenes laid down a big bet.
After some thought, Moneymaker pushed Brenes all-in — which he
quickly (and gladly) accepted.
Moneymaker was showing pocket 8s and was visibly shaken to see
he was up against Brenes’s pocket Aces. The world whirled on its
axis, though, when a turn brought another 8, giving Moneymaker
trips and sending Brenes South of the border.
Moneymaker, Part Deux
Like most sequels, this one isn’t that different from the original —
it was just shot with a much bigger budget and much bigger
names.
Not 12 hours after the previous bad beat (see the preceding section),
Moneymaker was up against Phil Ivey. Ten players were left; nine
would sit at the final table of the Main Event.
Phil was dealt pocket 9s, Moneymaker A-Q. Moneymaker raised
pre-flop and got a flat call from Ivey. The flop was a Q-Q-6 —
Moneymaker held trips, but held Ivey in the hand.
The turn was a diabolical 9, filling up Ivey. It was here that
Moneymaker put down a large bet, getting an immediate all-in
from Ivey. Moneymaker had no concept of the impending doom
and called, immediately becoming a 15-85 underdog.
The Ace on the river was a bullet through the heart of Ivey and
sent Moneymaker to the final table as chip leader.

When Wheels Go Flat
I was watching a single-table tournament online that had one of the
strangest forms of counterfeiting I’d ever seen. Five players were
left when the player under the gun raised — everyone folded
except for the big blind, who called.
The flop was 4 2 3. Immediately, the big blind pushed all-in,
as did the original under-the-gun raiser.
The big blind had 9-9 and played his over pair hard. The caller had
A 5 for a wheel.
The turn and river both produced 2s, and when the pot was
pushed toward the guy holding the pocket 9s, I was so blinkered
by what had happened that I had to go back and look to see that
the trip deuces on the board had given him a full house.
Spooky.
No-Limit Means No-Money
I was playing in a casino in Las Vegas a couple years ago when there
was a sudden commotion behind me. I walked over to witness the
aftermath of a heinous card exchange.
It was a larger No-Limit game. One player had been dealt A Q
and had managed to get his opponent to eventually commit all his
money to the pot on board cards of K J 10 9 — a very sweet
setup because the A-Q player is holding the nut straight and the
nut flush draw.
His opponent had been suckered into committing on a K-10, two pair.
Seems like a winner until you see the 10 surface on the river for a
full house. This was a 4-outer that cost one player about two grand.
Mr. Aggressive versus 
Johnny Conservative
I watched this one from the rail at the Main Event of the 2005
World Series. Two players had been occasionally bashing each
other: One played conservatively but strong, the other was so
Part V: The Part of Tens 
238

aggressive I thought he was going to have to be chained down.
With about 125 players left in the tournament, the stakes are high,
and every few positions you can climb is worth several thousand
dollars.
Pre-flop, Mr. Aggressive put down a sizeable raise, which Johnny
Conservative merely called. The flop was 4-4-2. Johnny Conservative
placed the minimum bet, which made Mr. Aggressive quickly push
all-in. Surprisingly, Mr. Conservative called instantly.
I knew the fast call from the conservative player meant that he had
a big hand, and when he turned them over, I could see just how big:
His pocket 4s had become quads. Mr. Aggressive turned as green
as the felt when he showed his pocket 5s. Having seen the lowball
flop, he had incorrectly assumed that Mr. Conservative had missed
it altogether and was merely playing over cards.
And although we’d seen the truth of the hand, there would be no
justice. Both the turn and the river were 5s, giving Mr. Aggressive
quad 5s and a winner. Mathematically speaking, this is the longest
possible beat in Hold’em — the odds of making this hand, after the
flop, are 1-in-990.
Not All Beats Are Bad
With a chapter this evil, I simply can’t leave it on a bad note, so I’ll
leave you this instead. . . .
Chris Derossi, my co-author on Winning at Internet Poker For
Dummies (Wiley), was playing poker at one of the Station Casinos
in Nevada. The floor man came over and handed every player at
the table $147.
“What’s this?”
“One of the players at another Station Casino was just bad beaten:
quads-over-quads. Everyone playing anywhere gets a cut of the
bad-beat jackpot.”

Ten Things You Can 
Do to Improve Your 
Hold’em Game
In This Chapter
 Thinking better
 Feeling better
 Being better
W
hen you start playing seriously, your next goal is to get
better — and there is always room to get better. In this
chapter, I give you some places to start and some ideas to try.
Studying Your Way Up
There are two seminal poker works you should get your hands on
and read. One is David Sklansky’s Theory of Poker, and the other is
Doyle Brunson’s Super System. (From a Hold’em point of view, the
differences between Super/System and Super System II are slight
enough that either edition is fine.)
Both of these works helped define the theory of modern poker.
Just as important, though: The more hard core you are in poker,
the more likely it is that your opponents have read and studied
these works. Understanding the concepts in these books will not
only let you get a peek at a more technical explanation of poker
than what I provide here, but also give you a deeper understanding
of your opponents — even if you never adopt the playing styles or
theories the books espouse.

Showing Off Your Game
When I was writing Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies, I spent
several hours playing online with my co-author, Chris Derossi, stand-
ing over my shoulder and commenting. I was truly amazed at how
much his commentary sharpened my game.
Find a friend you know and trust and start talking poker with him.
Play one account together online and talk about the situations you
run across as you play through the hands. When you play live
action, take notes on your play and interesting hands and come
back and talk with your pal.
Poker can be so incredibly emotional that having someone stand-
ing just outside your bubble of warped perception can be infinitely
valuable. I still use this trick and I continue to be amazed at how
much it improves my game.
Keeping Track of Your Bankroll
Every time you play you should record your wins and losses. Just a
simple spreadsheet on a computer, or even a small hardback ledger
(spiral notebooks lose pages over time), will do the trick. The steps
are simple:
1. When you sit down at a table, or launch your poker appli-
cation, write down how much you buy in for.
2. Write down anytime you buy in for more during the 
session.
3. Write down what you have at the end of the night when
you leave.
Keeping track of records is the only way to know if you’re winning or
losing. And make sure not to lie to yourself or not record a session
because “it didn’t really count.” Remember: From your money’s
point of view, everything counts — so everything should count in
your ledger, too. (Review Chapter 3 if you seem to be winning all
the time — or losing too much.)
Exercising
At the height of the Soviet chess system, all of their top players
had personal trainers. This was an ancient and primitive time well
before the concept of aerobics, back when Muhammad Ali was
Part V: The Part of Tens 
242

being taunted by some opponents as being “girlie” for skipping
rope. The Soviets (rightly) believed that the better your physical
conditioning, the longer you could endure the madness of an
extended chess match.
You should put your body to work for you, too. You don’t have to
get all Arnold Schwarzenegger about it. Even if you’ve never done
a lick of exercise, and you’re what is known in medical terms as a
couch potato grande, something as simple as walking 20 minutes a
day, every day, will increase your stamina during long sessions and
give you a nice little chunk of time where you can think about the
game without being in it.
If you want a good starting place, pick up a copy of Fitness For
Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley), and if you get the exercise bug,
you can always move up from there.
Digging into the Math
From a poker point of view, one of the great inventions of the last
ten years is the Hold’em odds calculator. What these calculators do
is take any hand you feed it (at pre-flop, flop, or turn) and grind out
thousands of random outcomes, giving you a percentage likelihood
of each hand winning from that point. You can use a calculator
either to figure out sticky hands you’re unsure of or to prove that
you really did make the right play when that idiot called you all-in
and sucked out.
My favorite calculator is on the Card Player Web site (http://
tinyurl.com/3jb3j). And while you’re there, you can look at a
hand I was wondering about several months ago: Q Q versus
A K with a flop of J 5 4. Which hand do you think is the
favorite here, and by how much? The answer may surprise you.
Reading Poker Web Sites
There are several good Web sites with poker forums and discus-
sions. I used to be a fan of recpoker.com (commonly called RGP),
but it’s not moderated and seems to be more and more filled with
insult and ego than it is hard fact.
These days I’m a fan of Two Plus Two (www.twoplustwo.com).
Any aspect of the game that you’re interested in, and at any level
of detail, can be found there. Better still, they use a moderator to
keep the spam and truly vile stuff to a minimum.

Scoring a Free Magazine
Card Player can be had for free in nearly any brick-and-mortar card
room. It’s worth picking up, not only for the writing, but also for
the super-great ads. You’ll find lots of specials, tournament info,
and other freebies that are available only to readers. (You can visit
Card Player online at www.cardplayer.com.)
Throwing in the Towel
Several years ago, I took a horrific string of bad beats. It was so bad
that it really started to rattle me. If I was playing No-Limit, I would
go all-in, see the my opponent’s under cards on the table, and start
“knowing” that the next cards off the deck were going to beat me.
If I had an extremely good hand in Limit, I would sit and look at the
community cards, trying to imagine the cards my opponents held
that would beat me.
Whenever my “insight” was correct, I became ever more convinced
that I was cursed. It was starting to bother me at a very deep, and
very real, level. I was even dreaming of opponents outdrawing me.
Not being satisfied with this level of mental torture, I would dig
even deeper and calculate the odds of taking the beats that I was
seeing as a series.
I finally said, “Enough!” and tore the page off my calendar. I circled
the day I decided I was finally fed up, swearing to myself that I
wouldn’t play cards for a year. Every morning, when I’d go to get
the milk for my cereal, I’d look at the page on the refrigerator and
remind myself to just let it all go. Although I kept reading and
studying, I didn’t play a single hand.
A year later, I returned renewed and reinvigorated. I enjoyed the
game, I didn’t psyche myself out anymore, and I was eating my
opponents alive. Aside from studying and talking to friends, taking
that year off is easily the best thing I’ve ever done for my game.
If you’re finding yourself getting more and more tweaked over the
game, take time off. The game is hard enough without having to
fight the added monster within you. When you come back to the
game, Redstradamus predicts that you’ll be pleasantly amazed at
how much better your game has become.

Varying Your Opponents
If you always play the same opponents — even if you’re consistently
beating them — you’re not improving your game as a whole. Playing
other players will get you used to other strategies, techniques, and
ideas. And no matter how good you are, you’ll occasionally run
across the better player. Watch, listen, and learn.
Playing Other Games
I find that playing a sprinkling of other games actually improves my
pure Hold’em record. I think the effect is twofold:
 It makes me less bored with the redundancy of Hold’em.
 I discover other, deeper idiosyncrasies about the game.
Omaha is good because it teaches you some variations of flop
dynamics and helps reinforce just how important it is that your
cards work together. Stud is good because it helps you focus on
the intentions of other players.
