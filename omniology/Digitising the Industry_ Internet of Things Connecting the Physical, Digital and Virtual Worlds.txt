Preface
IoT – Key Enabling Pillar for Digitising Industry
The Internet of Things (IoT) is considered to be one of the enablers of
the next industrial revolution. It is fuelled by the advancement of digital
technologies, as well as dramatically changing how companies engage in
business activities and people interact with their environment. The IoT’s
disruptive nature requires the assessment of the requirements for its future
deployment across the digital value chain in various industries and many
application areas.
The IoT is bridging the physical, digital, cyber and virtual worlds and
requires sound information processing capabilities for the “digital shadows” of
these real things. IoT applications are gradually moving from vertical, single-
purpose solutions to multi-purpose and collaborative applications interacting
across industry verticals, organizations and people, which represents one of
the essential paradigms of the digital economy. Many of those applications
still have to be identiﬁed, while involvement of end users in this innovation
is crucial.
IoT technologies are key enablers of the Digital Single Market (DSM),
which will have a potentially signiﬁcant impact on the creation of jobs and
growth, along with providing opportunities for IoT stakeholders in deploying
and commercializing IoT technologies and applications within European and
global markets.
The following chapters will provide insights into the state of the art
for research and innovation regarding the IoT, while exposing you to the
challenges and opportunities within future IoT ecosystems, which address
IoT technology as well as applications developments and deployments for
various domains (consumer/business/industrial/art).

Introduction
Peter Friess1
European Commission DG CONNECT, Belgium
The Internet of Things (IoT) has started to ﬂourish excitingly. After having
been in the expert corner for many years, new players and partners joined
the ﬁeld and contribute to manifest and extend the IoT. Business interest and
novel ideas drive now the deployment. Today we do no longer question what
IoT is or not, but more what solutions it can bring and what still needs to be
done for a full blossom.
In the European policy context, the creation of a genuine Single Market
encompasses the IoT as essential contribution. The European Commission
gives indeed a strategic dimension to IoTfor the Digital Single Market (DSM),
not only in terms of regulatory challenges but also with regards to overcome
interoperability issues and fragmented standards, probably one of the most
dominant obstacles at the moment. The key objective remains a collaborative,
responsible and fully functional IoT.
In the recently published IoT Staff Working Document2, which has been
elaborated based on extensive discussions with the IoT Community, we
identify and describe 3 imperative pillars in order to advance IoT in Europe:
1. A single market for the IoT: IoT devices and services (thus including
data) must be able to connect seamlessly and on a plug-and-play basis
anywhere in the European Union (EU), and scale up without hindering
from national borders;
2. A context of thriving IoT Ecosystems: new products and services in
selected lead markets such as Industrial IoT, and the existence of

open platforms across vertical silos, helping developers’ communities
to innovate and not causing lock-in situations for users;
3. A human-centred IoT: European values must be translated in the design
of IoT applications to empower citizens, and driven by high privacy and
security standards and notably through a “Trusted IoT” label.
In order to work on these pillars, we launched seven innovation plus two
coordination IoT Ecosystem projects in January 2016. They will be joined
by a new round of IoT Large Scale Pilots already in January 2017, dealing
with IoT scenarios in Assisted Living, Smart Agriculture, Wearables, Smart
Cities and Connected Cars.The pilots will be complemented by accompanying
measures on standardisation, security and privacy, creativity and art, further
research on IoT platforms, and international calls.

Introduction

In line with the ongoing cooperation with the IERC – the IoT European
Research Cluster, the European Commission is equally committed to
build upon the positive experience and to reinforce the cooperation with
AIOTI – the Alliance for IoT Innovation for making Europe a leading IoT
region. The Alliance has proven to be an important arena where frequently
competing market actors can cooperate in order to improve interoperability
issues of common interest and to contribute to the European IoT policy.
Besides the necessary emergence of IoT open platforms including neigh-
bouring technologies, these are the subjects to work on for the next period:
core standardisation, principles for appropriate design choices for technical
and semantical interoperability, and increase of the trust level in IoT. As these
questions do not allow to neglect the international dimension of IoT, we will
be strategically interested in maintaining the cooperation with other leading
IoT regions.
Looking ahead, we all are now establishing the ﬁrst building blocks
for a future hyper-connected society. Many new fascinating subjects such
as smart objects, new interfaces for augmented realities and light forms of
Artiﬁcial Intelligence will enter into the IoT applications and pave the way.
Linked to it we will see many paradigm shifts, from a stronger consideration
of environmental aspects and towards the transformation of competition to
co-creation.
IoT is the future.

2.1 Introduction
In the early 1990s, James F. Moore was at the origin of the concept of business
ecosystems [1], now becoming an interesting approach for the design of
Internet of Things (IoT) evolution and deployment.
Moore deﬁned “business ecosystem” as “an economic community sup-
ported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals – the
organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods
and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the
ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers,
competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they coevolve their capa-
bilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by
one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles
may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the
community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to
align their investments, and to ﬁnd mutually supportive roles”.
Given the current state of IoTevolution, and the complexity of IoTsystems
and actors involved, applying the concept of ecosystem is highly promising;
in particular for two reasons:

Business ecosystem [1].
• the nature of IoT itself prompts towards new ways of conceiving ICT
systems, and changing the understanding of business and interaction
processes and,
• a multitude of service providers involved whose role can change
over time.
The European Commission has thus decided to apply this concept for its
current IoT research and innovation policy. This concept is often similarly
speciﬁed as either IoT Ecosystem, IoT Innovation Ecosystem or IoT Business
Ecosystem; for reasons of simplicity we will talk here only about IoT
Ecosystems (used in plural as there will be one or more IoT Ecosystems).
Although this concept is certainly of universal nature, we will focus on IoT
Ecosystems with a European center of gravity – less in the sense of a limitation
but more as an operational vector of European values.
As the concept of IoT includes both a vertical and a horizontal dimen-
sion, a key feature of an IoT Ecosystem will therefore be the dynamic

interaction between the providers and users of horizontal IoT platforms and
applications and the providers and users of vertical solutions/domain-speciﬁc
environments. Evolution of the IoT will also bring new devices to the market,
around which IoT Ecosystems will take shape, and the IoT will act as an
essential driver for innovation and competitiveness. More jobs are expected
to be created, driven by the need for developers to work on applications and
interfaces. While today around 300,000 developers worldwide contribute to
the IoT, a new report by VisionMobile [2] projects 4.5 million developers by
2020, reﬂecting a 57% compound annual growth rate and a massive oppor-
tunity. As a consequence, the need is arising for well-educated employees in
terms of education and training in the EU, having the necessary digital and
interaction skills.
2.2 Support for IoT Ecosystem Creation
Whereas it might very be tempting to apply observations from natural and
biological ecosystems onto human social and economic systems, several
factors indicate that a one to one translation is not directly possible – humans
through their brain evolution have a different understanding of existence that
other species in natural systems whose primary objective is survival.

IoT Ecosystems Implementing Smart Technologies to Drive Innovation
Moreover,thenecessarysystemthinkingforecosystemsisaradicalchange
compared with a former system thinking from the last century, where the
control paradigm and a more technical understanding of systems were prin-
cipally dominating. In modern system theory, this understanding has been
replaced by an evolutionary approach and the vanishing of the idea of a
central controller. The present system thinking is based on self-organisation,
self-reference, co-evolution rather than opposition, and a more dynamic
understanding of time. Following this approach, the inﬂuence of IoT Ecosys-
tems is possible through the setting of boundary conditions; however, any
direct inﬂuence should be avoided as the ecosystem will resist or ignore this
input [3, 4].
In order to provide suitable boundary conditions for future IoT Ecosys-
tems, the European Commission, since 2014, has launched the following
actions:
• Stimulation of IoT Community building through the IERC – IoT Euro-
pean Research Cluster, in particular extending the outreach of ongoing
projects through platform creation and international cooperation.
• Preparation for the creation of an industry-driven Alliance for IoT Inno-
vation which was established in 2015 and counts today 500 members and
13 dedicated workgroups, based on the condition that members should
possess a strong foothold in Europe.
• Launch of a 51 MEUR call for proposals on large projects for IoT
Ecosystems in 2014 as part of the innovation programme Horizon
2020, linked to platforms for connected and smart objects. This call
included from a systemic perspective a mix of Innovation actions and
complementary Support actions for overcoming the fragmentation of
vertically-oriented closed systems, architectures and application areas.
Up to 10 MEUR were targeted to SMEs and start-ups working with these
platforms.
• A series of community building events, gathering more than 300 people
for discussing the call for IoT Ecosystems and providing a platform for
federation and a learning space.
• Preparation of an IoT Large Scale Pilot innovation programme with a
corresponding funding of around 100 MEUR for 2016–17, addressing
Smart Agriculture, Assisted Living, Wearables, Smart Cities and Con-
nected semi-autonomous cars. This will be coupled with a dedicated
subsequent call on future IoT architectures, concepts, methods and tools
for open IoT platforms advanced concepts for end-to-end IoT security
and privacy (35 MEUR).

2.3 Spurring Innovation in Lead Markets

• Fuelling the IoT community with input from leading and large IoT-
deploying regions such as Japan, Korea, and Brazil through joint
calls.
• Opening of the IoT innovation area to new players from the Cloud, Big
Data, Semi-autonomous systems and 5G domains, and to creativity and
art – makers, innovation hubs, geeks and artists (not to forget the STARTS
[5] initiative).
• Creation of an IoT Focus Area for improving coordination across Units,
Directorates and Directorate-Generals of the European Commission and
for providing a more centralised entry point to IoT.
These activities are complementary with various IoT initiatives in European
Member States and should not be perceived in isolation to further European
initiatives such the Digitising European Industry strategy.
2.3 Spurring Innovation in Lead Markets
With industry players all battling to “own” customers and their data, the IoT
market looks chaotic and fragmented.
Tangible business opportunities for IoT technologies can be found across
all “smart” environments identiﬁed by various experts. By combining esti-
mated market size and growth potentials, some of these environments have
emerged as offering the most realistic opportunities between now and the
coming ﬁve years.
The challenge is to foster the deployment of IoT solutions in Europe
through integration of advanced IoT technologies across the value chain,
demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale and in a usage context
as close as possible to operational conditions. Compared to existing solutions,
the roadblocks to overcome include i) the integration and further research and
development, where needed, of the most advanced technologies across the
value chain (components, devices, networks, middleware, service platforms,
application functions) and their operation at large scale to respond to real needs
of end-users (public authorities, citizens and business), based on underlying
open technologies and architectures that may be reused across multiple use
cases and enable interoperability across those; ii) the validation of user
acceptability by addressing, in particular, issues of trust, attention, security
and privacy through pre-deﬁned privacy and security impact assessments,
liability, coverage of user needs in the speciﬁc real-life scenarios of the pilot,

10
IoT Ecosystems Implementing Smart Technologies to Drive Innovation
Figure 2.3
IoT industry’s fragmentation [10].
iii) the validation of the related business models to guarantee the sustainability
of the approach beyond the project.
The most prominent “smart” environments, already producing a number
of use cases, are the following:
• Smart Homes will offer business opportunities in home security, energy
applications and household appliances.
• Personal Wellness applications and wearable devices for both generic
and health-speciﬁc purposes are a big opportunity in the area of Smart
Health. They will be accompanied by remote health monitoring.
• In Smart Manufacturing, operations and asset management already
represent a fertile ground for IoT solutions and applications.
• Smart Cities are equipped with sensors, actuators and other appliances
providing information that, properly valorised, will improve the living
conditions of their inhabitants.
• Smart Mobility will require new mobile ecosystems based on trust,

of consumer-centric transactions and services.
• For Smart Energy, smart meters and smart grids are powered by IoT and

models where all actors of the value chains are closely interconnected and
use collaborative platforms to share data on resource ﬂows, and end-users
are empowered in their consumption patterns.
TheAlliance for IoT Innovation –AIOTI has established a number of working
groups in the areas that it considers more mature for IoT innovation and where
a greater potential for cross-cutting business models is looming ahead [6]. In
addition, the support of creativity-based innovation is pivotal, adding the force
of cultural and creative industries to foster smart, sustainable and inclusive
IoT services and products.
As an outcome of extended consultations and studies, the European
Commission has decided to ﬁnance IoT pilot projects with a larger scope
and a potential for changing the perception and acceptance in the following
ﬁelds:
• Pilot 1: Smart living environments for ageing well (EU contr. up to 20
MEUR)
• Pilot 2: Smart Farming and Food Security (EU contr. up to 30 MEUR)
• Pilot 3: Wearables for smart ecosystems (EU contr. up to 15 MEUR)
• Pilot 4: Reference zones in EU cities (Smart Cities) (EU contr. up to
15 MEUR)
• Pilot 5: Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment (EU contr. up
to 20 MEUR)
These pilots are complemented by two categories of support actions:
• Co-ordination of and support to the pilots through mapping of architec-
ture approaches; interoperability and standards approaches at technical/
semantic levels; requirements for legal accompanying measures; com-
mon methodologies for design, testing and validation; federation of pilot
activities and transfer; exploitation of security and privacy mechanisms,
international cooperation and exploitation of combination of ICTandArt.
• Consideration of responsible innovation and societal aspects, also
through involvement of experts outside the traditional ﬁeld of IoT.

IoT Ecosystems Implementing Smart Technologies to Drive Innovation
It is expected that these IoT Large Scale Pilot projects will enter into action as
of January 2017, complementing the already active IoT Ecosystem projects
from the previous call for proposals, now brought under the common umbrella
IoT European Platform Initiative – IoT-EPI [7]. Conceptually the future IoT
Large Scale Pilot projects are a variant in terms of IoT Ecosystem building and
target in particular innovation integration and the overcoming of acceptance,
adoption and legislative barriers against wide-ranging IoT deployment.
2.4 Outlook
Looking forward, we can contemplate that the current and upcoming IoT
activities, when properly set up, will contribute a lot to the birth and evolution
of IoT Ecosystems in Europe.
The recent EC Digital Single Market (DSM) technologies and public
services modernisation package provides a set of coherent policy measures
aiming at the digital transformations of our industries and at maximising their
impact on economic growth. The actions for IoT are listed in the communi-
cation “Digitising European Industry – Reaping the full beneﬁts of a Digital
Single Market [8], the communication “Priorities for ICT Standardisation for
the Digital Single Market”, and under the free ﬂow of data initiative of the
DSM Strategy.
Fostering an interoperable environment for IoT Ecosystems and the
development of missing interoperability standards will be pivotal. Exploration
of options and guiding principles, including developing standards for trust,
privacy and end-to-end security, e.g. through a ‘trusted IoT label’, are equally
high on the policy agenda.
With regards the Horizon work programme 2018–20 for IoT, it is expected
to support IoT Large Scale Pilot initiatives of societal and industrial relevance
and to facilitate use cases crossing existing IoT pilots and implementations,
both in Europe and with international partners. In addition, the existing IoT
Focus Area might also encompass more aspects of Cloud technologies, Big
Data analysis, autonomous behaviour, interface technologies and art.

you accomplish.” Chris Bailey
3.1 Internet of Things Vision
Internet of Things (IoT) is considered one of the next industrial revolution
enablers, which is fuelled by the advancement of digital technologies. IoT
is dramatically changing how companies engage in business activities, and
15

16
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
how people will interact with their environment. Its disruptive nature requires
the assessment of the requirements for the future deployment across the digital
value chain in various industries and in many application areas.
IoT is a concept and a paradigm with different visions, and multidisci-
plinary activities. IoT considers pervasive presence in the environment of a
variety of things, which through wireless and wired connections and unique
addressing schemes are able to interact with each other and cooperate with
other things to create new applications/services and reach common goals.
In the last few years IoT has evolved from being simply a concept built
around communication protocols and devices to a multidisciplinary domain
where devices, Internet technology, and people (via data and semantics)
converge to create a complete ecosystem for business innovation, reusabi-
lity, interoperability, that includes solving the security, privacy and trust
implications.
The IoT is the network of physical objects that contain embedded tech-
nology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or
the external environment. The conﬂuence of efﬁcient wireless protocols,
improved sensors, cheaper processors, and a bevy of startups and established
companies developing the necessary management and application software,
has ﬁnally made the concept of the IoT mainstream. The IoT makes use of
synergies that are generated by the convergence of Consumer, Business and
Industrial Internet customer, Business and Industrial Internet. The conver-
gence creates the open, global network connecting people, data, and things.
This convergence leverages the cloud to connect intelligent things that sense

17
and transmit a broad array of data, helping creating services that would not
be obvious without this level of connectivity and analytical intelligence. The
dynamics surrounding emerging IoT applications are very complex and issues
such as enablement, network connectivity, systems integration, value-added
services, and other management functions are all needs that generally must
be addressed when the end-users seek to connect intelligent edge devices into
complex IoT applications [59].
In this context, the research and development challenges to create a
smart world are enormous. IoT ecosystems offer solutions comprising of
large heterogeneous systems of systems beyond an IoT platform and solve
important technical challenges in the different industrial verticals and across
verticals.
IoT’s disruptive nature requires the assessment of the requirements for
the future deployment across the digital value chain in various industries and
in many application areas considering even better exchange of data, the use
of standardized interfaces, interoperability, security, privacy, safety, trust that
will generate transparency, and more integration in all areas of the Internet
(consumer/business/industrial).
IoT will generate even more data that needs to be processed and analysed,
and the IoT applications will require new business models and product-
service combinations to address and tackle the challenges in the Digital Single
Market (DSM).

IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
The use of platforms is being driven by transformative technologies such
as cloud, things, and mobile. The IoT and services makes it possible to
create networks incorporating the entire manufacturing process that convert
factories into a smart environment. The cloud enables a global infrastructure
to generate new services, allowing anyone to create content and applications
for global users. Networks of things connect things globally and maintain their
identity online. Mobile networks allow connection to this global infrastructure
anytime, anywhere.The result is a globally accessible network of things, users,
and consumers, who are available to create businesses, contribute content,
generate and purchase new services.
Platforms also rely on the power of network effects, as they allow more
things, they become more valuable to the other things and to users that make
use of the services generated. The success of a platform strategy for IoT
can be determined by connection, attractiveness and knowledge/information/
data ﬂow.
In this context, the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI),
was initiated following the European and global IoT technology and market
developments.
The aim ofAIOTI is to create and master sustainable innovative European
IoT ecosystems in the global context to address the challenges of IoT techno-
logy and applications deployment including standardisation, interoperability
andpolicyissues,inordertoacceleratesustainableeconomicdevelopmentand
growth in the new emerging European and global digital markets. The AIOTI
is connecting/integrating technologies and applications across the digital value
chain and has strong links with the other European initiatives (Private Public
Partnerships – PPPs, Joint Technology Initiatives – JTIs, European Innovation
Partnerships – EIPs, etc.). The positioning of AIOTI in relation with the other
initiatives is presented in Figure 3.3.
ThemembersofAIOTIjointlyworkonthecreationofadynamicEuropean
IoT ecosystem. This ecosystem is building on the work of the IoT Research
Cluster (IERC) and spill over innovation across industries and business sectors
of IoT transforming ideas to IoT solutions.
The European Commission (EC) considers that IoT will be pivotal in
enabling the DSM, through new products and services. The IoT, big data,
cloud computing and their related business models will be the three most
important drivers of the digital economy, and in this context it is fundamental
for a fully functional single market in Europe to address aspects of ownership,
access, privacy and data ﬂow – the new production factor.

IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
3.1.1 IoT Common Deﬁnition
The IoT is a key enabling technology for digital businesses and one of the
main drivers that is contributing to transform the Internet. IoT technologies
are deployed in different sectors, from agricultural in rural areas, health and
wellness to smart home and smart-X applications in cities.
The IoT is bridging the virtual, digital, physical worlds and mobile
networks need to scale to match the demands of billions of things, while
the processing capabilities require addressing the information provided by the
“digital shadow” of these real things. This need focusing on the developments
in the virtual world and the physical world for solving the challenges of IoT
applications. In the virtual world, network virtualization, software-deﬁned
hardware/networks, device management platforms, edge computing and data
processing/analytics are developing fast and urgency to be endeavoured
as enabling technologies for IoT. Connecting the virtual, digital, physical
worlds generates knowledge through IoT applications and platforms, while
addressing security, privacy and trust issues across these dimensions.
Smart IoT applications modify the way people interact with the intelligent
spaces (called also cyber-spaces), from how remotely control appliances at
home to how the care for patients or elderly persons are performed. The
massive deployment of IoT devices represents a tremendous economic impact
and at the same time offers multiple opportunities. The IoT’s potential is
underexploited, the physical and intelligent are largely disconnected, requiring
a lot of manual effort to ﬁnd, integrate, and use information in a meaningful
way. IoT and its advances in intelligent spaces advances can be categorised
along with the key technologies at the core of the Internet.
Intelligent spaces are created and enriched by IoT and they are environ-
ments in which ICTs, sensor and actuator systems become embedded into
physical objects, infrastructures, and the places embedded of technology
that facilitate physical-human-cyber communication named intelligent sur-
roundings or cyber places in which people live, (e.g. smart cities, industrial/
manufacturing plants, homes and buildings, automotive and entertainment).
The goal is to enable computers and smart edge devices to take part in activities
never previously involved and people to interact with computers and these
devices at the edge more naturally i.e. gesture, voice, movement, and context,
etc. The IoT developments in the various sectors has created IoT ecosystems
that are focusing on Internet of X technologies and applications that address
the speciﬁc needs of the respective sector with the goal to be interoperable
across various other sectors as presented in Figure 3.5.

3.1 Internet of Things Vision
21

Integration.

22
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
Figure 3.5
Internet of X developments in various industrial sectors.
The traditional distinction between network and device is starting to blur
as the functionalities of the two become indistinguishable. Shifting the focus
from the IoT network to the devices costs less, scales more gracefully, and
leads to immediate revenues.
As a result of this convergence, the IoT applications require that classical
industries are adapting and the technology will create opportunities for new
industries to emerge and to deliver enriched and new user experiences and
services.
In addition, to be able to handle the sheer number of things and objects that
willbeconnectedintheIoT,cognitivetechnologiesandcontextualintelligence
are crucial.This also applies for the development of context aware applications
that need to be reaching to the edges of the network through smart devices
that are incorporated into our everyday life.
The Internet is not only a network of computers, but it has evolved into
a network of devices of all types and sizes, vehicles, smartphones, home
appliances, toys, cameras, medical instruments and industrial systems, all
connected, all communicating and sharing information all the time.
The IoT has different meanings at different levels of abstractions through
the value chain, from lower level semiconductor through the service providers.
IoT is a paradigm with different visions, and involving multidisciplinary
activities.

3.1 Internet of Things Vision
23
The IoT as a “global concept” requires a common high-level deﬁnition.
Considering the wide background and required technologies, from sensing
device, communication subsystem, data aggregation and pre-processing to the
object instantiation and ﬁnally service provision, generating an unambiguous
deﬁnition of the “IoT” is non-trivial.
The IERC is actively involved in ITU-T Study Group 13, which leads
the work of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) on standards
for next generation networks (NGN) and future networks and has been part
of the team which has formulated the following deﬁnition [42]: “Internet
of things (IoT): A global infrastructure for the information society, enabling
advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on
existing and evolving interoperable information and communication tech-
nologies. NOTE 1 – Through the exploitation of identiﬁcation, data capture,
processing and communication capabilities, the IoT makes full use of things
to offer services to all kinds of applications, whilst ensuring that security
and privacy requirements are fulﬁlled. NOTE 2 – From a broader perspec-
tive, the IoT can be perceived as a vision with technological and societal
implications.
The IERC deﬁnition [45] states that IoT is “A dynamic global network
infrastructure with self-conﬁguring capabilities based on standard and inter-
operable communication protocols where physical and virtual “things” have
identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent
interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the information network”.
3.1.2 Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Cognitive IoT
IoT applications are generating data collected from various domains and
industrial sectors. The data generated provides insights from the environments
and applications that generated it. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) techniques
providetheframeworkandtoolstogobeyondanalyticsofrealtimemonitoring
and automation use cases for IoT and move to IoT platforms that use concepts
from artiﬁcial intelligence and apply them to speciﬁc IoT use cases to provide
smarter decision-making.AI-enabled IoTapplications add a new layer of func-
tionality and access, creating the next generation of smart homes/buildings,
smart vehicles, and smart manufacturing by providing intelligent automation,
predictive analytics and proactive intervention.
In the IoT context,AI will support companies in ﬁnding the smart data and
analyse the trends and patterns for better decision-making based on deﬁned
set of rules.

24
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
The AI techniques will enable cognitive systems to be integrated with IoT
applications creating optimized solutions for each individual applications.
Cognitive IoT technologies will allow embedding intelligence into systems
and processes, allowing businesses to increase efﬁciency, ﬁnd new business
opportunities, and to anticipate risks and threats so they can better address
them. The IoT applications will gather and integrate data from many types of
sensors and other sources, reason over data, and learn from the interactions,
while creating communities of devices that share information.The information
collected can be interpreted and managed by people, IoT applications or IoT
platforms using cognitive systems in order to generate new and better services
and use cases.
The data generated by edge devices combined with the unstructured data
available from sources ranging from news Web sites and social networks
can be combined using cognitive IoT capabilities at the edge or at the
cloud level.
The use on artiﬁcial intelligence, swarm intelligence and cognitive tech-
nologiestogetherwithdeeplearningtechniquesforoptimisingtheIoTservices
provided by IoT applications in smart environments and collaboration spaces
will create solutions capable of transforming industries and professions.
3.1.3 IoT of Robotic Things
IoT, artiﬁcial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, swarm technologies
are the technologies that will provide the next phase of development of
IoT applications. Robotics provide the programmed machines designed to be
involved in labour intensive and repetitive work, while deep machine learning
is the science of allowing/empowering machines to function using learning
algorithms instead of programing. The combination of these disciplines opens
the developments of autonomous systems combining robotics and machine
learning for designing robotic systems to autonomous. Machine learning
is part of advance state of intelligence using statistical pattern recognition,
parametric/non-parametric algorithms, neural networks, recommender sys-
tems, swarm technologies etc. in order to perform autonomous tasks. The
industrial IoT is a subset of the IoT, where edge devices, processing units
and networks interact with their environments to generate data to improve
processes.
The IoT, the technologies, architectures, and services that allow massive
numbers of sensor enabled, uniquely addressable “things” to communicate
with each other and transfer data over pervasive networks using Internet

3.1 Internet of Things Vision
25
protocols, is expected to be the next great technological innovation and
business opportunity. Many IoT initiatives are focused on using connected
devices with edge devices to manage, monitor and optimize systems and their
processes. Advanced and transformational aspects of ubiquitous connectivity
andcommunicationincludeintelligentdevicesthatmonitorevents,fusesensor
data from a variety of sources, use local and distributed “intelligence” to
determine a best course of action, and then act to control or manipulate objects
in the physical world, and in some cases while physically moving through
that world. The concept called Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT), addresses
the many ways IoT technologies and robotic “devices” intersect to provide
advanced robotic capabilities, along with novel applications, and by extension,
new business, and investment opportunities [17].
The combination of advanced sensing, communication, local and dis-
tributed processing, and actuation take the original vision for the IoT to
Figure 3.6
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) pervasive technology.

26
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
a wholly different level, and one that opens up completely new classes of
opportunities for IoT and robotics solution providers, as well as users of their
products. The concept allows to:
• Deﬁne and describe the characteristics of robotics technologies that
distinguish them as a separate, unique class of IoT objects, and one that
differs considerably from the common understanding of IoT edge nodes
as simple, passive devices.
• Reveal how the key features of robotics technology, namely movement,
mobility, manipulation, intelligence and autonomy, are enhanced by the
IoTparadigm, and how, in turn, the IoTis augmented by robotic “objects”
as “intelligent” edge devices.
• Illustrate how IoT and robotics technologies combine to provide for
Ambient Sensing,Ambient Intelligence andAmbient Localization, which
can be utilised by new classes of applications to deliver value.
IoT, cognitive computing and artiﬁcial intelligence are very important to the
strategies for digital value chain integration addressing the implementation of
IoT applications in various smart environments.
3.2 IoT Strategic Research and Innovation Directions
The IERC is bringing together EU funded projects with the aim of deﬁning
a common vision of IoT technology and addressing European research
challenges. The rationale is to target at the large potential for IoT-based
capabilities and promote the use of the results from the existing projects
to encourage convergence of ongoing work to tackle the most important
deployment issues and the transfer of research and knowledge to products and
services and apply these in real IoT applications. The vison is illustrated in
Figure 3.7 [59].
IoT is a new revolution of the Internet. Things make themselves recogniz-
able and they obtain intelligence thanks to the fact that they can communicate
information about themselves and they can access information that has been
aggregated by other things.
The technological trend is a move from systems where there are multiple
users/people per device, people in control loop of the system, and the system
providing the ability for people to interact with people. The IoT brings a new
paradigm where there are multiple devices per user; the devices are things that
are connected and communicating with other things. The interaction will be
with a heterogeneous continuum of users, things and real physical events

(e.g., move left/right/up/down, change humidity/temperature/light/sound,
etc.) and the Internet is the common convergence connectivity capability,
replacing the previous independent systems.
The objectives of IERC is to provide the research and innovation trends,
presenting the state of the art in terms of IoT technology and societal analysis
in order to apply the develop to the IoT funded projects and further into
the market applications and in the EU policies. The ﬁnal goal is to test and
develop innovative and interoperable IoT solutions in areas of industrial and
public interest. The IERC objectives are addressed as an IoT continuum of
research, innovation, development, deployment and adoption as presented in
Figure 3.8 [59].

28
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
Figure 3.8
IoT continuum: research, innovation, deployment.
The IERC Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) is the result
of a discussion involving the projects and stakeholders involved in the IERC
activities, which gather the major players of the European ICT landscape
addressing IoT technology priorities that are crucial for the competitiveness
of European industry.
IERC SRIA covers the important issues and challenges for the IoT
technology. It provides the vision and the roadmap for coordinating and
rationalizing current and future research and development efforts in this ﬁeld,
by addressing the different enabling technologies covered by the IoT concept
and paradigm.
The future IoT developments will address highly distributed IoT appli-
cations involving a high degree of distribution, and processing at the edge
of the network by using platforms that that provide compute, storage, and
networking services between edge devices and computing data centres. These
platforms will support emerging IoT applications that demand real-time
latency (i.e. mobility/transport, industrial automation, safety critical wireless
sensor networks, etc.). These developments will bring new challenges as
presented in Figure 3.9 [59].
The IoT value will come from the combination of edge computing and data
centre computing considering the optimal business model, the right location,
right timing, and efﬁcient use of available network resources and bandwidth.

3.2 IoT Strategic Research and Innovation Directions
29
Figure 3.9
IoT future challenges.
The IoT architecture, like the Internet, will grow in evolutionary fashion
from a variety of separate contributions and there are many current efforts
regarding architecture models under development. The challenges for the IoT
architecture are the complexity and cooperative work for developing, adopting
and maintaining an effective cross-industry technology reference architecture
that will allow for true interoperability and ease of deployment.
The IERC will work for providing the framework for the convergence
of the IoT architecture approaches considering the vertical deﬁnition of the
architectural layers end-to-end security and horizontal interoperability. IoT
technology is deployed globally, and supporting the activities for common
uniﬁed reference architecture would increase the coherence between various
IoT platforms. A common architectural approach will require focusing on the
reference model, speciﬁcations, requirements, features and functionality. In
particular, this issue would be important in preparation of the future IoT LSPs,
although time schedule might be difﬁcult to synchronize.
The IERC SRIA is developed with the support of a European-led commu-
nity of interrelated projects and their stakeholders, dedicated to the innovation,
creation, development and use of the IoT technology.
Since the release of the ﬁrst version of the IERC SRIA, we have witnessed
active research on several IoT topics. On the one hand this research ﬁlled
several of the gaps originally identiﬁed in the SRIA, whilst on the other it

30
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
created new challenges and research questions. Recent advances in areas such
as cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, robotics, autonomic computing,
and social networks have changed the scope of the Internet of Thing’s conver-
gence even more so. The Cluster has a goal to provide an updated document
eachyearthatrecordstherelevantchangesandillustratesemergingchallenges.
The updated release of this SRIA builds incrementally on previous versions
[45, 46, 73] and highlights the main research topics that are associated with
the development of IoTenabling technologies, infrastructures and applications
with an outlook towards 2020 [51].
The research activities include the IoT European Platforms Initiatives
(IoT-EPI) program that includes the research and innovation consortia that
are working together to deliver an IoT extended into a web of platforms for
connected devices and objects. The platforms support smart environments,
businesses, services and persons with dynamic and adaptive conﬁguration
capabilities. The goal is to overcome the fragmentation of vertically-oriented
closed systems, architectures and application areas and move towards
open systems and platforms that support multiple applications. IoT-EPI
is funded by the European Commission (EC) with EUR 50 million over
three years.
The projects involved in the programs are listed in the Figure 3.10. The
projects are part of the IERC and are cooperating to deﬁne the research
and innovation mechanisms and identify opportunities for collaboration in
IoT ecosystems to maximise the opportunities for common approaches to
platform development, interoperability and information sharing. The common
activities are organised under six task forces (Figure 3.11) that are conceived
and developed under the IoT-EPI program.
The task forces are complementary to the IERC activity chains. The
activity chains are created to favour close cooperation between the IoT Cluster
projects, the IoT-EPI programme and the AIOTI working groups to form an
arena for exchange of ideas and open dialog on important research challenges.
The activity chains are deﬁned as work streams that group together partners or
speciﬁc participants from partners around well-deﬁned technical activities that
will result into at least one output or delivery that will be used in addressing
the IERC objectives.
The research and innovation items addressed and discussed in the task
forces of the IoT-EPI program, the IERC activity chains and the AIOTI
working groups for the basis of the IERC SRIA that addresses the roadmap of
IoT technologies and applications in line with the major economic and societal
challenges underlined in the EU 2020 Digital Agenda [52].

The IERC SRIAis developed incrementally based on its previous versions
and focus on the new challenges being identiﬁed in the last period.
The updated release of the SRIA is highlighting the main research
topics that are associated with the development of IoT infrastructures and
applications, with an outlook towards 2020 [51].

3.2 IoT Strategic Research and Innovation Directions
33
The timeline of the IERC IoT SRIAcovers the current decade with respect
to research and the following years with respect to implementation of the
research results. As the Internet and its current key applications show, it is
anticipated that unexpected trends will emerge leading to unforeseen new
development paths.
The IERChas involved expertsworkinginindustry, researchandacademia
to provide their vision on IoT research challenges, enabling technologies and
the key applications, which are expected to arise from the current vision of
the IoT.
The multidisciplinary nature of IoT technologies and applications is
reﬂected in the IoT digital holistic view adapted from [32].
IoT demands an extensive range of new technologies and skills that many
organizations have yet to master and creates challenges for organizations
exploiting the IoT. The technologies and principles of IoT will have a very
broad impact on organizations, affecting business strategy, risk manage-
ment and a wide range of technical areas such as architecture and network
design. The top 10 IoT technologies for 2017 and 2018 as presented by
Gartner [21] are:
• IoT Security – due to hardware and software advances IoT security is a
fast-evolving area through 2021 and the skills shortage today will only
accelerate. Enterprises need to begin investing today in developing this
expertise in-house and begin recruitment efforts. Many security problems
Figure 3.13

34
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
today are the result of poor speciﬁcation, design, implementation and lack
of knowledge/training. It is expected that the companies adopting IoT are
investing in these areas.
• IoTAnalytics – that require new algorithms, architectures, data structures
and approaches to machine learning if organizations are going to get
the full value of the data captured, and knowledge created. Distributed
analytics architectures to capitalize on pervasive, secure IoT network
architectures will evolve into become knowledge sharing networks.
• IoT Device Management – Signiﬁcant innovation will result from the
challenges of enabling technologies that are context, location, and state-
aware while at the same time consistent with data and knowledge
taxonomies. IoT Device Management will probably break the boundaries
of traditional data management and create data structures capable of
learning and ﬂexing to unique inbound data requirements over time.
• Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks – Low-power, short-range
networks will dominate wireless IoT connectivity through 2025, far
outnumbering connections using wide-area IoT networks.
• Low-Power, Wide-Area Networks – traditional cellular networks cannot
deliver a proper combination of technical features and operational cost
for those IoT applications that need wide-area coverage combined with
relatively low bandwidth, good battery life, low hardware and operating
cost, and high connection density. Wide-area IoT networks aim is to
deliver data rates from hundreds of bits per second (bps) to tens of
kilobits per second (kbps) with nationwide coverage, a battery life of up to
10 years, an endpoint hardware cost of around $5, and support for
hundreds of thousands of devices connected to a base station or its equiv-
alent. The ﬁrst low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) were based on
proprietary technologies, but in the long term, emerging standards such
as Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) will likely dominate this space.
• IoT Processors – low-end 8-bit microcontrollers will dominate the IoT
through 2019 and shipments of 32-bit microcontrollers will overtake the
8-bit devices by 2020. The report does not mention the 16-bit processors
ever attaining critical mass in IoT applications.
• IoT Operating Systems – a wide range of IoT-speciﬁc operating systems
with minimal and small footprint will gain momentum in IoT through
2020 as traditional large-scale operating systems including Windows
and iOS are too complex and resource-intensive for the majority of IoT
applications.

3.2 IoT Strategic Research and Innovation Directions

• Event Stream Processing – some IoTapplications will generate extremely
high data rates that must be analysed in real time. Systems creating tens
of thousands of events per second are common, and millions of events per
second can occur in some telecom and telemetry situations. To address
such requirements, distributed stream computing platforms (DSCPs)
have emerged. They typically use parallel architectures to process very
high-rate data streams to perform tasks such as real-time analytics and
pattern identiﬁcation.
• IoT Platforms – IoT platforms bundle infrastructure components of an
IoTsystem into a single product.The services provided by such platforms
fall into three core categories: (1) low-level device control and operations
such as communications, device monitoring and management, security,
and ﬁrmware updates; (2) IoT data acquisition, transformation and man-
agement; and (3) IoT application development, including event-driven
logic, application programming, visualization, analytics and adapters to
connect to enterprise systems.
• IoT Standards and Ecosystems – ecosystems and standards are not
precisely technologies, most eventually materialize as application pro-
gramming interfaces (APIs). Standards and their associated APIs will be
essential because IoT devices will need to interoperate and communicate,
and many IoT business models will rely on sharing data between multiple
devices and organizations.
Many IoT ecosystems will emerge, and commercial and technical battles
between these ecosystems will dominate areas such as the smart home, the
Smart City and healthcare. Organizations creating products may have to
develop variants to support multiple standards or ecosystems and be prepared
to update products during their life span as the standards evolve and new
standards and related APIs emerge.
The IERC IoT SRIA addresses these IoT technologies and covers in
a logical manner the vision, the technological trends, the applications, the
technology enablers, the research agenda, timelines, priorities, and ﬁnally
summarises in two tables the future technological developments and research
needs.
The ﬁeld of the IoT is based on the paradigm of supporting the IP protocol
to all edges of the Internet and on the fact that at the edge of the network many
(very) small devices are still unable to support IP protocol stacks. This means
that solutions centred on minimum IoT devices are considered as an additional
IoT paradigm without IP to all access edges, due to their importance for the
development of the ﬁeld.

36
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
The IERC vision is that “the major objectives for IoT are the creation of smart
environments/spaces and self-aware things (for example: smart transport,
products, cities, buildings, rural areas, energy, health, living, etc.) for climate,
food, energy, mobility, digital society and health applications” [45].
Today, there is a strong acceleration in the evolution of connected devices,
with accelerating scale and scope, as well as higher focus on interoperability.
IoT technologies and applications put more and more emphasis on integration
of sensors, devices and information systems across industry verticals and
organisations to transform operations and enable creation of new business
models. IoT technologies focus on gaining new insights from analytics
based on data from diverse sources to support decision-making, and improve
products, services and experiences for end users. It is envisaged that our
environmentbecomesincreasingly“smart”byusingthisnetworkofconnected
sensors.
Increasingly complex IoT solutions require more advanced communica-
tion platforms and middleware that facilitate seamless integration of devices,
networksandapplications.Inthiscontext,theemergenceofIoTplatformswith
multiple functionalities (i.e. connectivity management, device management,
application enablement, etc.) developed for the purpose of supporting and
enabling IoT solutions enables rapid development and lower costs by offering
standardised components that can be shared across multiple solutions in many
industry verticals.
The IoT applications however will gradually move from vertical, single
purpose solutions to multi-purpose and collaborative applications interacting
across industry verticals, organisations and people, being one of the essential
paradigms of the digital economy. Many of those applications still have to be
identiﬁed and involvement of end-users in this innovation is crucial.
Digital economy enables and conducts the trade of goods and services
through electronic commerce on the internet. The digital economy is based
on three pillars: supporting infrastructure (hardware, software, telecoms,
networks, etc.), e-business (processes that an organisation conducts over
computer-mediated networks) and e-commerce (transfer of goods online) [5].
This deﬁnition needs to be extended as IoT applications and technologies
are more and more embedded in our society. Economic activities classiﬁed
as “digital economy” are expanding their scale, and are becoming diversiﬁed
in their transaction forms with many companies in providing product and
service hybrids. Intelligent physical goods as part of IoT applications are
capable of connecting, capture and producing “smart” data and information

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications

foruseindigitalserviceswithouthumaninterventions.Inthiscontext,physical
equipment has measuring and communication capabilities, data consciousness
and processing capabilities and the digital economy will be driven by IoT
“system of systems” interactions where new business models and product-
service combinations are aligned with customers that are integrating the
concept of product-as-a-service and product-as-an-experience.
IoT is expected to boom in many sectors, such as smart buildings and
cities, in the energy sector, in safety and security management, transportation,
healthcare, farming and many more, thereby bringing huge business oppor-
tunities and jobs in those sectors as well as in the enabling industries (data
centres, communications and information technology).
The IoT applications are addressing the societal needs and the advance-
ments to enabling technologies such as nanoelectronics and cyber-physical
systems continue to be challenged by a variety of technical (i.e., scientiﬁc and
engineering), institutional, and economical issues.
IERC is focusing on applications chosen as priorities for the next years
and the Cluster provides the research challenges for these applications. While
the applications themselves might be different, the research challenges are
often the same or similar.
Every industry is being disrupted by IoT, the universe of intelligent
devices, processes, services, tools and people communicating with each other
as part of a global ecosystem. As technology evolves, products, homes,
enterprises and entire cities will be continuously connected as presented
Figure 3.14. This represents fundamental change for the insurance industry:
Figure 3.14
The IoT is connecting homes, cars, people, organizations and even entire
cities [9].

38
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
How are things insured? With what partners? Which services and enabling
technologies? The answers to these questions are the ﬁrst steps toward
the development of new and innovative business models. The IoT is driv-
ing a connected, as-a-service economy, and traditional insurers must adapt
quickly, deciding whether to move up or out. Insurers will need to dramat-
ically reshape their business model, combining insurance with technology,
ecosystem services and partners. Insurers are about to become “Insurers of
Things” [9].
This new dimension has to be consider for IoT use cases and applications
covering various domains and even more when we consider cross-domain
applications and implementations.
3.3.1 Wearables
Wearables are integrating key technologies (e.g. nanoelectronics, organic
electronics, sensing, actuating, communication, low power computing, visu-
alisation and embedded software) into intelligent systems to bring new
functionalities into clothes, fabrics, patches, watches and other body-mounted
devices.
These intelligent edge devices are more and more part of integrated IoT
solutions and assist humans in monitoring, situational awareness and decision-
making. They can provide actuating functions for fully automated closed-loop
solutions that are used in healthcare, well-being, safety, security, infotainment
applications and connected with smart buildings, energy, lighting, mobility or
smart cities IoT applications. Many people already use wearables to monitor
their activity level or as a fashion accessory. For example, many of us have a
ﬁtbit or a smartwatch.
Creating a seamless user experience is essential for wearable applica-
tion success. In the future, wearable devices will be more pervasive (e.g.
embedded in clothes or pills) and more multifunctional (smartwatches that
open doors, start cars and so on) and will become an essential part of
people’s life.
The IoT applications market in Europe and in the world is moving very
fast towards industrial solutions, e.g. smart cities, homes, buildings. The IoT
markets have multiple shapes, from simple smart-X devices to complete
ecosystems with a full value chain for devices, applications, toolkits and
services. Wearables’ worldwide market has been identiﬁed as the opportunity
to materialize what the IoT area has not addressed yet in terms of business
creation and commercialization of devices “things”, software platforms,

applications and complete IoT solutions. “Wearables will become the world’s
best-selling consumer electronics product after smartphones”, according to
Euromonitor [4]. In the same study the big estimation for sales of wearables
are projected to exceed 305 million units in 2020, with a compound annual
growthrate(CAGR)of55percentduringthenextﬁveyears.Followingthisbig
estimation, yet at the Wearables area there is a need for a catalyst that looks for
the wider deployment and market uptake of novel/emergent wearables-based
IoT applications, technologies and platforms.
The market for wearable computing is expected to grow six-fold, from
46 million units in 2014 to 285 million units in 2018 [36].
Because of wearables are associated to daily life activities and the tendency
is to personalise them, following art and design inﬂuenced (user-centric)
approaches is also crucial. Wearables and its “wear” nature (mobility) will
transform diverse sectors such as the healthcare, wellbeing, work safety,
public safety and leisure. By involving end users in the creation, the design of

wearables and the identiﬁcation of services needs, it is expected an exponential
growth in the ecosystem for wearables market application.
Wearable technology has been there since early 80’s, however the limita-
tion in technology and the high cost on materials and manufacturing generated
that wearable ecosystem(s) lost acceptance and stop its grow at that early
stage. In todays’ technology and economy conditions where technology has
evolved and manufacturing cost being reduced Wearable Technology is the
best channel for user acceptance and deployments in large user communities.
In wearables co-existence with IoT systems and deployed technologies will
mark the difference using today’s user experience and accelerating tomorrow’s
user acceptance that is reﬂected in return on investment by focusing in the most
common wearable devices.
Demands in technologies and platforms (supply side) require further
work to cope with interoperability, design and arts for user adoption, tech-
nology and management and business modelling. In the other hand from
users and communities (demand side) it is required to pay attention in
reliability of devices, cross-domain operation, and cost reduction and device
reusability.
Today’s biggest challenges for wearable technology is the reticence to
use wearables for privacy or data protection concerns, or the fatigue of using
a wearable. In addition, other operational issues also exist such as having
the necessary ecosystem in place to support wearable devices, which act as
a barrier to deployment, service development or take up. Creating products
which meet both end-users need and which create value for the suppliers
and users will ensure viable business cases. Wearable devices, which can
take or recommend an action based on real time data analysis and perform
more than one function (e.g. pain monitoring/treatment that also serves as a
security veriﬁcation that open doors) are more likely to be taken up by different
groups of users. They are also more likely to consider them as essential part of
their life.
Fitness tracking is the biggest application today and this opens the
opportunities for watches that are capable of tracking blood pressure, glu-
cose, temperature, pulse rate and other vital parameters measured every few

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
41
seconds for a long period of time to be integrated in new kinds of healthcare
applications. Glasses for augmented reality can be another future wearable
application.
Healthcare industry is taking huge advantage of smart technology for
mobile devices and smart wearables is looking to be a big and proﬁtable
market. Smart technology that will be the key to the optimal operating of
our future society, especially when it comes to healthcare. Some of the smart
wearables, already on the market, or in progress engineered for the healthcare
industry have the following features [29]:
• Asthma monitoring and management device with companion app cur-
rently in design and production phase, offering real time data and
alerts when an asthma situation is experienced, offering journaling,
treatment plans, displays and tracking and information on the treating

correct time and how the patient is responding to the therapies
• Smart device helping people to quit smoking by sensing a person’s

• Smart contact lenses under development helping restoring the eye’s
natural autofocus on near objects for people suffering from vision loss
occurring with age
• Smart bra and app under development with sensors embedded to sense
the conditions and rhythms in breast tissue to alert of the possibility of

the patient is moving around wrong or if they may need some assistance
in moving the proper way to prevent ulcer
• Smart watch with medical grade sensors for kids with certain ailments
such as epilepsy with real time data sent to a companion app giving alerts
and other goals and health information.
The wearable technology market in Europe remains an emerging market that
is expanding across numerous sectors and promises to create new markets
and deliver important societal beneﬁts. Research from CCS Insight shows
that, based on current trajectories, the Global Wearables market is expected to
triple by 2019. AIOTI WG07 [65] saw Europe’s natural strengths in privacy,
data protection as well as in ubiquitous broadband availability enabling
Europe to be a strong global competitor in the wearable technologies and
solutions sector. If we add Europe’s good brand name and talent in style
and fashion then we can claim that Europe can be a leader in the market of
wearables.
3.3.2 Smart Health, Wellness and Ageing Well
Healthcare and wellness offer unique opportunities for comprehensive IoT
implementation.Healthcaretreatments,cost,andavailabilityaffectthesociety
and the citizens striving for longer, healthier lives. IoT is an enabler to achieve
improved care for patients and providers. It could drive better asset utilization,
new revenues, and reduced costs. In addition, it has the potential to change
how health care is delivered.
The emergence of Internet of Health (IoH) applications dedicated to citi-
zens health and wellness that spans care, monitoring, diagnostics, medication
administration, ﬁtness, etc. will allow the citizens to be more involved with

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
43
their healthcare. The end-users could access medical records, track the vitals
signals with wearable devices, get diagnostic lab tests conducted at home or
at the ofﬁce building, and monitor the health-related habits with Web-based
applications on smart mobile devices. The application of IoT in healthcare
can improve the access of care to people in remote locations or to those who
are incapacitated to make frequent visits to the hospital. It can also enable
the prompt diagnosis of medical conditions by measuring and analysing a
person’s parameters. The medical treatment administered to the person under
care can be improved by studying the effect of a therapy and the medication
on the patients’ vitals.
The IoT healthcare applications require a careful balance between data
access and sharing of health information vs. security and privacy concerns.
Some information could be shared with a physician, while other type of infor-
mation, will be not accepted to be provided divulge. For these applications,
there is a need to have paradigm shift in human behaviour in order for patients
toevolve,adaptandultimatelyembracewhattheIoTtechnologycanprovide,a
secure Internet domain that can host all health information and push important
health data back to the patient and their healthcare providers [59]. The state
of health in a population can be best measured by focusing on metabolic
syndromes with a set of clear and staged health actions attached to it in
order to ﬁght the consequences of such modern lifestyle. If not changed, this
lifestyle often results in an early progression of those diseases (as shown in
Figure 3.17) [63].
The population of people over 60 is growing at a faster rate than the
rest of the population. Unlike previous generations, more seniors will stay
at home. In the future IoT technology might allow older people to retain
independence with a choice to keep family informed when help is needed.
Silver Economy is deﬁned as “an environment in which the over-60 interact
and thrive in the workplace, engage in innovative enterprise, help drive the
marketplace as consumers and lead healthy, active and productive lives”
[71]. There are three groups in the ageing population, depending on their
health, i.e. active, fragile and dependent while each of these groups have
their own need patterns. At country level differences in needs patterns exist,
i.e. depending on the local environment, with the existence of models for
care, governmental policy and needs at European geographical levels, i.e.
Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, Continental, South-European and Eastern-European.
The Silver Economy is related to concepts such as “active and health ageing”,
“ambient assisted living”, “e-health”, “age management”, “smart care” etc.

and depends on the perspective taken or challenge/solution emphasised, using
different taxonomies.
Demographic change, the rising incidence of chronic disease, unmet
demand for more personalised care, and cost pressure are trends requiring
a new, integrated approach to health and social care. Such integration –
if brought about in the right manner – has the potential to improve both
the quality, security and the efﬁciency of care service delivery. Potentially
this can be to the beneﬁt of all: beginning with elder people in need of
care and their family and friends, and including care professionals, service
provider organisations, payers and other governance bodies. Within this
ongoing change process, the challenge is how to adopt relevant and secure
IoT technologies to realise care integration and avoid that telecare, telehealth
and other IoT applications in this ﬁeld remain locked up in segregated
silos, mirroring the overall situation of today. In order to capture all the
complexity of the ambient assisted living (AAL) market scenario, the previous
deﬁnition was taken into account as a starting point but have also taken into
account a technology view, based on the technology stack supporting the
AAL solutions.

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
45
IoT applications are pushing the development of platforms for implemen-
tingAAL systems that will offer services in the areas of assistance to carry out
daily activities, health and activity monitoring, enhancing safety and security,
getting access to medical and emergency systems, and facilitating rapid health
support.
The main objective is to enhance life quality for people who need per-
manent support or monitoring, to decrease barriers for monitoring important
health parameters, to avoid unnecessary healthcare costs and efforts, and to
provide the right medical support at the right time.
The IoT plays an important role in healthcare applications, from managing
chronic diseases at one end of the spectrum to preventing disease at the other.
The smart living environments at home, at work, in public spaces should
be based upon integrated systems of a range of IoT-based technologies
and services with user-friendly conﬁguration and management of connected
technologies for indoors and outdoors.
These systems can provide seamless services and handle ﬂexible con-
nectivity while users are switching contexts and moving in their living
environments and be integrated with other application domains such as
energy, transport, or smart cities. The advanced IoT technologies, using
and extending available open service platforms, standardised ontologies
and open standardised APIs can offer many of such smart environment
developments.
The IoT technology not only overcomes the inconvenience of distance,
but also provides people with greater choice and control over the time
and the place for monitoring their condition, increasing convenience and
making their conditions more manageable. At the same time, it also reduces
some of the pressures on clinics and acute hospitals. IoT could make a
signiﬁcant contribution to the management of a number of chronic conditions,
heart failure, hypertension, asthma, diabetes and can be integrated with
other living environments domains such as mobility, home/buildings, energy,
lighting, cities.
Many elderly people are adopting technology more than ever, and in the
process, they face unique barriers to usage because they previously had not
used them in work situations and commonly have physical limitations that
make using computer and the Internet more difﬁcult. The improvement in the
IoT technology and user interfaces can lower the barriers and help the elderly
people to adopt the technology since many of these people are enthusiastic
and express strong openness to learning.

46
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
As the population ages, and as the digital health ﬁeld expands, IoT
technologies addressing the unique challenges of aging in place is becoming
a reality.
Many elderly people want to age in place and need to be as independent
as possible, while the IoT technology provides cognitive aids for independent
living. Old people with Alzheimer’s, dementia, or memory loss receive help
with tasks through cueing, scheduling assistance and ﬁnance safety for seniors
by on and off switches for caregivers or relatives to help aging people manage
their money by blocking purchases, setting spending limits, sending alerts
about suspect charges, etc. IoT activity sensors monitor movements in the
home and medicine boxes give medication reminders, keep track of steps, and
include an emergency button.
The IoT allows building up an archive of patient behaviour in their own
home that will enable local analytics to produce probability curves to predict
usual and unusual behaviour. Using this, a more accurate prediction of unusual
behaviour can be detected that is used to trigger alerts to patients, family and
carers,whilehelpingelderlypatientsstayoutofhospital(andthussigniﬁcantly
reduce the cost of hospital admissions).
In this context, there is a need for fundamental shift in the way we think
about older people, from dependency and deﬁcit towards independence and
well-being. Older people value having choice and control over how they
live their lives and interdependence is a central component of older people’s
well-being. They require comfortable, secure homes, safe neighbourhoods,
friendships and opportunities for learning and leisure, the ability to get out
and about, an adequate income, good, relevant information and the ability to
keep active and healthy. They want to be involved in making decisions about
the questions that affect their lives and the communities in which they live.
They also want services to be delivered not as isolated elements, but as joined-
up provision, which recognises the collective impact of public services on their
lives. Public services have a critical role to play in responding to the agenda
for older people.
Within this ongoing change process, advanced IoT technologies provide
a major opportunity to realise care integration. At the same time, telecare,
telehealth and other IoT applications in this ﬁeld also remain locked up in
segregated silos, mirroring the overall situation.
These IoT technologies can propose user-centric multi-disciplinary solu-
tionsthattakeintoaccountthespeciﬁcrequirementsforaccessibility,usability,
cost efﬁciency, personalisation and adaptation arising from the application
requirements.

3.3.3 Smart Clothing
Smart textile, e-fabrics, smart clothing will be produced in all kinds of types
and with different features and outlooks and in many cases will embed the
features and functionalities of wearable devices of today. The common factor
is that smart textiles are made to observe to the wearer, and to react to environ-
mental conditions including chemical, mechanical, electrical, chemical, and
magnetic, etc. Intelligent fabrics have digital components, sensors, actuators,
circuits, and computers embedded in them to collect process and output data
in different ways.
Smart clothing will include many features and different smart solutions
are expected on the market in the next years [30, 31]:
• Smart shirt with app, keeping information in 3D showing if too much
pressure is put on a certain part of the body, keeping track of your per-
formance, giving information to prevent getting injured while training,
with real time feedback
• Health related smart shirt measuring heart rate, breathing rate, sleep
monitoring, workout intensity measurements
• Bio sensing silver ﬁbres woven into the shirt
• Clothing to track the amount of calories burned
• Clothing to track movement intensity during workout
• Compression fabric that aids in blood circulation and with muscle
recovery
• Body monitor sensors – embedded micro sensors throughout the shirt
keeping track of temperature, heart beat and heart rate, and the speed and
intensity of your workouts
• Shirt able to keep the measured biometrics information by using a small
black box woven into the shirt
• Clothing with moisture control and odour control
• Smart shirts can be used in hospitals for monitoring heart beat and
breathing in patients
• Baby monitoring – baby garment telling if the baby is sleeping and
monitoring the baby’s vital signs
• Baby outﬁt with sensors and a small monitor on it
• Smart socks for baby, monitoring the baby’s breath with alert
features
• Eco-friendly solar garments as it harnesses the energy of the sun and
enables the wearer to charge the owner’s phone, music players, and other
powered electronic devices

48
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
• Adaptive survival clothing that uses moisture and temperature regulation
properties of wool to adapt the human body to normal, non-threatening
conditions.
The combination of these “devices” embedded in the clothing with other IoT
devices that are monitoring the environment will create new opportunities,
new use cases, and business models across various sectors.
3.3.4 Smart Buildings and Architecture
Buildings consume 33% of world energy, this ﬁgure grows to 53% of world
electricity, and it will continue to grow in the future. As a result, buildings
have an important weight in regards to the energy challenge.
Improving life of the occupants implies many aspects including comfort
with light, temperature, air quality, having access to services facilitating life
inside the building, adapting the behaviour to the needs of the occupants.There
is also a direct economic interest to do it as it is recognized that productivity
level is connected to the comfort level.
For being energy efﬁcient, the consumption can be optimized locally while
taking into account the needs of the occupants and the hosted processes.
Buildings can also produce energy from different sources such as Photovoltaic
panels and store energy for future usage. This energy can be used internally or
given back to the grid. In addition, buildings are not isolated islands but part of
larger ecosystem at the district or even city level. The energy price can change
over time and have an impact on the energy optimization. It could happen also
that the optimization is better driven at a more global level, set of buildings
or district for instance. In the smart building implementations, it is necessary
to simplify the management, control and maintenance of buildings during the
whole life cycle, starting from the design phase. This should lead to much
better process efﬁciency while driving down the operation costs (OPEX).
As a result there is a strong need to leverage on technology and IoT for
making buildings smarter, improve life of the occupants (personal or at work),
make the buildings more energy efﬁcient, and facilitate the management
and maintenance of the building during its whole life cycle. This has to be
done not only with the new constructed buildings but also with the existing
ones through adequate retroﬁt solutions. It is important to keep in mind that
new construction represents only 2% of the total installed base each year.
The different ingredients of IoT, connectivity, control, cloud computing,
data analytics, can all contribute to make smarter buildings (ofﬁces, industrial,
residential, tertiary, hotels, hospitals, etc.):

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications

• Connected to the grid (“smart grid ready”)
• Connected to the Smart City
• Energy efﬁcient while taking care of the comfort of the occupants
• Adaptable to the changing needs of the occupants over time
• Providing services for a better life of the occupants
• Easy to maintain during the whole life cycle at minimal cost
The solutions focus primarily on environmental monitoring, energy man-
agement, assisted living, comfort, and convenience. The solutions are based
on open platforms that employ a network of intelligent sensors to provide
information about the state of the home. These sensors monitor systems such

as energy generation and metering; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
(HVAC); lighting; security; and environmental key performance indicators.
The networking aspects are bringing online streaming services or network
playback, while becoming a mean to control of the device functionality over
the network.
Integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS) both within the building
and with external entities, such as the electrical grid, requires stakeholder
cooperation to achieve true interoperability. Maintaining security will be a
critical challenge to overcome in smart buildings IoT applications [71].
In the IoT ecosystems, the collaboration among various stakeholders to
optimise the smart buildings allow operators of buildings to ﬁnd ways to con-
serve energy for both environmental and economic reasons, while architects
and builders, are trying to make new buildings as “green” as possible.
IoTtechnologiesareextendingtoday’sbuildingautomationandtransform-
ing the smart buildings and facilities through IoT platforms providing intel-
ligence, security, modularity, and intuitive interfaces that allow autonomous
operations. The evolution of building system architectures includes an adap-
tation level that will dynamically feed the automation level with control logic,
i.e. rules, using algorithms and rules as Web resources in a similar way as for
sensors and actuators.
The market sizing and opportunities for smart commercial buildings; is
increasing and Memoori report “The Internet of Things in Smart Buildings
2014 to 2020” [33] makes an objective assessment of the market for IoT
Technologies, Networks and Services in Buildings 2014 to 2020. Market
ﬁgures indicate that the overall market for systems in buildings will grow
from $110.9Bn in 2014 to $181.1Bn in 2020, with Physical Security, Lighting
Control and Fire Detection and Safety representing the three largest segments.
In order to calculate the technical market potential for the IoT in Buildings.
The report has assessed the additional cost requirement of adding connec-
tivity through sensors to existing or newly installed building systems, as well
as projecting the growth in related network hardware and IoTdata services that
the IoT in Buildings would enable to generate. The report therefore projects
that the global market for the IoT in Buildings will rise from $22.93Bn in 2014
to over $85Bn in 2020. In this context, the following estimates are made:

• The networking and related services segment of the market will show a
steady growth of 22.6% CAGR rising from $9.53Bn in 2014 to $32.43Bn
in 2020 which represents 37% of overall revenues by 2020. Similar to
the market for connectivity hardware, effective network deployment to
keep up with the rising bandwidth demands of the IoT in Buildings will
be crucial to the effective delivery of services and the management of
data ﬂows.
The concept of “Internet of Building” that integrates the information from
multiple intelligent building management systems and optimise the behaviour
of individual buildings as part of a larger information system. These systems
are used by facilities managers in buildings to manage energy use and energy
procurement and to maintain buildings. It is based on the infrastructure of the
existing Intranets and the Internet, and therefore utilises the same standards
as other IT devices. Reductions in the cost and increased reliability of IoT
applications using wireless technologies for monitoring and control are trans-
forming building automation, by making the maintenance of energy efﬁcient
healthy productive workspaces in buildings increasingly cost effective [50].
IoT technologies and applications used across the buildings and architec-
ture sector need to be integrated with applications in other sectors. The value
in “Internet of Buildings” is as much in the edge devices and the data collected,
exchanged and processed. Collecting, exchanging and processing data from
buildingservicesandequipmentprovidesagranularviewofhoweachbuilding
is performing, allowing the development of building systems that collect, store
and analyse data at the edge and in the cloud, providing better operational
efﬁciency and integration with IoT platforms and applications across various
sectors. These efforts will cover the following domains of research.
• IoT architecture and IoT platforms to address smart buildings and archi-
tecture monitoring and control strategies and integrate monitors/controls
from edge sensors/actuators devices to the data exchange and processing.
• Communication technologies and infrastructures required for IoT build-
ings applications and their integration with applications and IoT plat-
forms across various consumer and industrial sectors.
• Hardware/software, machine learning and analytics approaches support-
ing real-time interoperable distributed decision support monitoring and
control in heterogeneous environments.
• New developments in the smart buildings addressing business mod-
els, applications, IoT technology, interoperability at various levels and
frameworks, regulation and law, etc.

3.3.5 Smart Energy
Future energy supply will be largely based on various renewable resources
and this source of energy will inﬂuence the energy consumption behaviour,
demanding an intelligent and ﬂexible electrical grid which is able to react
to power ﬂuctuations by controlling electrical energy sources (generation,
storage) and sinks (load, storage) and by suitable reconﬁguration. The func-
tions are based on networked intelligent devices (appliances, micro-generation
equipment, infrastructure, consumer products) and grid infrastructure ele-
ments, largely based on IoT concepts.
The energy grid development requires a number of features as listed below
in order to implement the vison of the smart grid concept.
• It will integrate traditional and emerging power sources and make the
delivery of energy cleaner, safer, and more economical.
• Operators will have the transparency and visibility to monitor and analyse
the ﬂow of energy, and two-way communication with consumers’ smart
meters to analyse consumption patterns.
• Intelligent devices that collect and analyse massive volumes of data will
enable operators to plan for contingencies for variable resources.
• Smart IoT devices will manage the distribution of energy based on real-
timedataandsituationalawareness,asopposedtohistoricaldatapatterns.
• Predictive maintenance capabilities will alert operators when a compo-
nent needs attention or repair, reducing the need for ongoing inspections.
• Adaptive analytics will enable systems to automatically balance energy
loads to reduce stress and prevent overheating.
The high number of distributed small and medium sized energy sources and
power plants can be combined virtually ad hoc to virtual power plants. Using
this concept, areas of the grid can be isolated from the central grid and supplied
from within by internal energy sources such as photovoltaics on the roofs,
block heat and power plants or energy storages of a residential area.
IoT is expected to facilitate the deployment of new smart energy apps
within energy stakeholders ICT (generation and retail companies, Grid and
market operators, new load aggregators) bringing new options for real-
time control strategies across energy asset portfolios for faster reactions to
power ﬂuctuations. These new technologies should combine both centralised
and decentralised approaches integrating all energy generation (generation,
storage) and load (demand responsive loads in residential, buildings and
industries as well as storage and electrical vehicles) through interconnected
real-time energy markets. IoT should also improve the management of asset

performance through more accurate estimations of asset health conditions and
deployment of fact based preventive maintenance.
These new smart energy apps will largely be based on the networking
of IoT intelligent devices embedded within Distributed Energy Resources
(DER) spread across the energy system such as consumer appliances, heating
and air conditioning, lighting, distributed generation and associated inverters,
grid edge and feeder automation, storage and EV charging infrastructures.
While energy systems have historically been controlled through single cen-
tral dispatch strategies with limited information on grid edge and con-
sumers behaviours, energy systems are now characterized by rapidly growing
portfolios of DER structured through several layers of control hierarchies
interconnecting the main grid down to microgrids within industries and
communities, nanogrids at building level and picogrids at residential scale.
Moreover as most of DER have diffused within end-user premises, new
transactive control approaches are required to facilitate their coordination
at various scales of the Grid system through real-time pricing strategies.
Furthermore aggregators and energy supply companies have started to develop
new ﬂexibility offers to facilitate DER coordination virtually through ad hoc
virtual power plants raising new connectivity, security and data ownership
challenges.
Meanwhile climate change has also recently exposed grids to new
extreme weather conditions requiring reconsidering Grid physical and ICT

56
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
architectures to allow self-healing during signiﬁcant disasters while taking
advantage of distributed generation and storage to island critical grid areas
(hospital, large public campus) and maintain safe city areas during emergency
weather conditions.
Integration of cyber-physical systems engineering and technology to the
existing electric grid and other utility systems is a challenge. The increased
system complexity poses technical challenges that must be considered as
the system is operated in ways that were not intended when the infras-
tructure was originally built. As technologies and systems are incorporated,
security remains a paramount concern to lower system vulnerability and
protect stakeholder data [71]. These challenges will need to be address as
well by the IoT applications that integrate heterogeneous cyber-physical
systems.
A new report by Mercom Capital Group indicates that smart grid, battery
and storage, as well as energy efﬁciency companies raised up to US$1.7bn in
VC funding in 2015. The report which examines mergers and acquisition
activity in the smart grid, battery/storage, and energy efﬁciency sectors,
revealed that the smart grid sector raised US$425 million across 57 deals
in 2015, in comparison to US$384 million over 74 deals in the previous year
(2014) [79].
The energy grid is expected to be the implementation of a kind of “Internet”
in which the energy packet is managed similarly to the data packet – across
routers and gateways, which autonomously can decide the best pathway for
the packet to reach its destination with the best integrity levels. In this respect,
the “Internet of Energy” concept is deﬁned as a network infrastructure based
on standard and interoperable communication transceivers, gateways and
protocols that will allow a real time balance between the local and the global
generation and storage capability with the energy demand.
The Internet of Energy (IoE) concept is deﬁned as a network infrastructure
based on standard and interoperable communication nodes that will allow
the end-to-end real time balance between the local and the central gener-
ation, responsive demand and storage. It will allow units of energy to be
transferred when and where it is needed. Power consumption monitoring will
be performed on all levels, from local individual devices up to national and
international level [78].
Considering the fast diffusion of energy resources on end user premises –
becoming prosumers-, the new IoT platform considered will also allow
a high level of consumer awareness and involvement through community
benchmarking.

as integral element of future smart energy systems acting as a power load as
well as moveable energy storage linked through IoT technologies. EVs will
require to transact with the Energy system according to their charge status,
usage schedule and energy price which itself will depend on abundance of
renewable energy available at a certain time in the energy system. This should
ultimately allow monitoring the carbon footprint of all mobility services from
wells to wheels.
Latencies are critical when talking about electrical control loops. Even
though not being a critical feature, low energy dissipation should be manda-
tory. In order to facilitate interaction between different vendors’ products the
technology should be based on a standardized communication protocol stack.
When dealing with a critical part of the public infrastructure, data security
isofthehighestimportance.Inordertosatisfytheextremelyhighrequirements
on reliability of energy grids, the components as well as their interaction must
feature the highest reliability performance.
IoT applications in the energy sector go beyond one industrial sector.
Energy, mobility and home/buildings sectors will have to share data through
energy gateways that will control the transfer of energy and information.
Flexible data ﬁltering, data mining and machine learning procedures as
well as new generation IoT platforms are necessary to handle the high amount
of raw data provided by billions of data sources while guaranteeing resiliency,
security as well as end user data protection. System and data models need to
support the design of real-time decision support systems, which guarantee a
reliable and secure operation of vital energy infrastructures.
The future research challenges will cover the following areas:
• ICT/IoT architectures and IoT platforms to revisit grid control strategies
and integrate hierarchical controls from energy nodes with sensors
through ranges of aggregation structures (pico, nano and micro energy
systems).
• Novel communication infrastructures required at each level of these
grid nodes to meet necessary Service level agreements for each of the
energy service considered (energy efﬁciency, grid ancillary services, grid
resiliency, etc. . .).
• New software/smart data and machine learning approaches support-
ing real-time distributed decision support/transactive controls in highly
volatile environments.

58
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
• New apps for energy prosumer feedback facilitating smooth real-time
energy transactive controls in daily lives leveraging consumer ICT
(mobile, TVs, vehicle, IoT, etc. . .).
• IoTend-to-end security framework approach and privacy, trust and safety
in order to secure the grid from hackers and acts of cyber-sabotage.
Security needs to be built into every device starting at the base of the
software stack.
• Providing intelligent solution for connecting and protecting legacy sys-
tems (the older, aging parts of the existing energy infrastructure) by
building secure Internet gateways that enable cloud-based central control
systems to collect local intelligence data from the systems while blocking
attacks.
• Embedding intelligence into the energy systems with smart energy
devices that deliver manageability, security, and connectivity, while
driving down the cost of development and deployment.
• Privacy by design of the energy systems that will assure that the data
generated by using the monitoring systems will not expose sensitive
customer information. This requires that the same security principals that
apply to the energy enterprise will also be applied at the consumer level.
3.3.6 Smart Mobility and Transport
The connection of vehicles to the Internet gives rise to a wealth of new pos-
sibilities and applications which bring new functionalities to the individuals
and/or the making of transport easier and safer. In this context the concept
of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) [78] connected with the concept of Internet of
Energy (IoE) represent future trends for smart transportation and mobility
applications.
At the same time creating new mobile ecosystems based on trust, security
and convenience to mobile/contactless services and transportation applica-
tions will ensure security, mobility and convenience to consumer-centric
transactions and services.
Representing human behaviour in the design, development, and operation
of cyber-physical systems in autonomous vehicles is a challenge. Incorpo-
rating human-in-the-loop considerations is critical to safety, dependability,
and predictability. There is currently limited understanding of how driver
behaviour will be affected by adaptive trafﬁc control cyber-physical systems.
In addition, it is difﬁcult to account for the stochastic effects of the human
driver in a mixed trafﬁc environment (i.e., human and autonomous vehicle

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
59
drivers) such as that found in trafﬁc control cyber-physical systems. Increas-
ing integration calls for security measures that are not physical, but more
logical while still ensuring there will be no security compromise. As cyber-
physical systems become more complex and interactions between components
increases, safety and security will continue to be of paramount importance
[71]. All these elements are of the paramount importance for the IoT
ecosystems developed based on these enabling technologies.
Self-driving vehicles today are in the prototype phase and the idea is
becoming just another technology on the computing industry’s parts list. By
using automotive vision chips that can be used to help vehicles understand the
environment around them by detecting pedestrians, trafﬁc lights, collisions,
drowsy drivers, and road lane markings. Those tasks initially are more the
sort of thing that would help a driver in unusual circumstances rather than
take over full time. But they’re a signiﬁcant step in the gradual shift toward
the computer-controlled vehicles that Google, Volvo, and other companies are
working on [56].
These scenarios are, not independent from each other and show their full
potential when combined and used for different applications.
Technical elements of such systems are smart phones and smart vehicle on-
board units, which acquire information from the user (e.g. position, destination
and schedule) and from on-board systems (e.g. vehicle status, position, energy
usage proﬁle, driving proﬁle). They interact with external systems (e.g. trafﬁc
control systems, parking management, vehicle sharing managements, electric
vehicle charging infrastructure).
The concept of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is the next step for future smart
transportation and mobility applications and requires creating new mobile
ecosystems based on trust, security and convenience to mobile/contactless
services and transportation applications in order to ensure security, mobility
and convenience to consumer-centric transactions and services.
Smart sensors in the road and trafﬁc control infrastructures need to collect
information about road and trafﬁc status, weather conditions, etc.This requires
robust sensors (and actuators) which are able to reliably deliver information
to the systems mentioned above. Such reliable communication needs to be
based on IoT communication, which consider the timing, safety, and security
constraints. The integration of the communication gateway into vehicles is
presented in Figure 3.23. The expected high amount of data will require
sophisticated data mining strategies. Overall optimisation of trafﬁc ﬂow and
energy usage may be achieved by collective organisation among the individual
vehicles.

IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
When dealing with information related to individuals’ positions, desti-
nations, schedules, and user habits, privacy concerns gain highest priority.
They even might become road blockers for such technologies. Consequently,
not only secure communication paths but also procedures which guarantee
anonymity and de-personalization of sensible data are of interest.
Connectivity will revolutionize the environment and economics of vehi-
cles in the future: ﬁrst through connection among vehicles and intelligent
infrastructures, second through the emergence of an ecosystem of services
around smarter and more autonomous vehicles.
In this context the successful deployment of safe and autonomous vehicles
(SAE1 international level 5, full automation) in different use case scenarios,
using local and distributed information and intelligence is an important
achievement. This is based on real-time reliable platforms managing mixed
mission and safety critical vehicle services, advanced sensors/actuators, nav-
igation and cognitive decision-making technology, interconnectivity between
vehicles (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. There is a
need to demonstrate in real life environments (i.e. highways, congested urban
environment, and/or dedicated lanes), mixing autonomous connected vehicles
and legacy vehicles the functionalities in order to evaluate and demonstrate
dependability, robustness and resilience of the technology over longer period
of time and under a large variety of conditions.
The introduction of the autonomous vehicles enables the development
of service ecosystems around vehicles and multi-modal mobility, considering
thatthevehicleincludesmultipleembeddedinformationsourcesaroundwhich
information services may be constructed. The information may be used for
other services (i.e. maintenance, personalised insurance, vehicle behaviour
monitoring and diagnostic, security and autonomous cruise, etc.).
The emergence of these services will be supported by open service plat-
forms that communicate and exchange information with the vehicle embedded
information sources and to vehicle surrounding information, with the goal of
providing personalised services to drivers. Possible barriers to the deployment
of autonomous vehicles and ecosystems are the robustness sensing/actuating
the environment, overall user acceptance, the economic, ethical, legal and
regulatory issues.
The integration of the interconnected and intelligent intra vehicle com-
munication systems and the vehicle to infrastructure into the overall IoT
service platforms will offer the possibility to develop new applications and

63
services it is expected that 80% of vehicles in Europe will be two-way
connected by 2018. This offer the possibility to combine the vehicle to
infrastructure communication and integration with service providers with
intermodal vehicle navigation applications and navigation routes based on
real-time information. IoT applications for vehicle sharing and the use of
transport city ﬂeets (EVs for transport of goods and persons) are part of the
deployment of new IoT technologies and related IoT ecosystems. These will
open the stepwise rollout of autonomous driving technologies and the linkages
of these technologies with shared-use business models and issues relating to
the regulatory framework and consumer trust.
For autonomous vehicle applications, computing at the edge of the mobile
network will be used for processing the data locally and provide services in
real time.
Data transmission costs and the latency limitations of mobile connectivity
pose challenges to autonomous vehicle IoT applications that cannot rely only
on cloud computing.
Mobile edge computing enables IoT applications to deliver real-time and
context-based mobile moments to users of IoT solutions.
In IoT applications involving autonomous vehicles a combination of cloud
and mobile edge computing technologies have to be consider by analysing the
following:
• Cloud, mobile edge and IoT are increasingly intertwined and used
together to improve IoT application experiences. IoT solutions gain func-
tionality through cloud services, which in turn open access to third-party
companies and up-to-date information.
• Mobile connectivity for real time autonomous systems create challenges
for cloud-enabled IoT solutions since latency limitations affects user
experiences in the IoT real time applications context.
• Mobile edge computing assure the real time network connectivity, loca-
tion and context information. The technology gives access to “near edge”
computing capabilities and a cloud like service environment close to the
users and edge devices.
• Mobile edge computing is a component of the network infrastructure
for blockchain, since the replication of “blocks” via devices can be
implemented at the edge.
3.3.7 Industrial IoT and Smart Manufacturing
The role of the IoT is becoming more prominent in enabling access to devices
and machines, which in manufacturing systems, were hidden in well-designed

64
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
silos. This evolution will allow the IT to penetrate further the digitized
manufacturing systems. The IoT will connect the factory to a completely new
range of applications, which run around the production. This could range from
connecting the factory to the smart grid, sharing the production facility as a
service or allowing more agility and ﬂexibility within the production systems
themselves. In this sense, the production system could be considered one of
the many Internets of Things (IoT), where a new ecosystem for smarter and
more efﬁcient production could be deﬁned.
The evolutionary steps towards smart factory require enabling access to
external stakeholders in order to interact with an IoT-enabled manufacturing
system that is formed of connected industrial systems that communicate
and coordinate their data analytics and actions to improve performance and
efﬁciencyandreduceoreliminatedowntime.Thesestakeholderscouldinclude
the suppliers of the productions tools (e.g. machines, robots), as well as the
production logistics (e.g. material ﬂow, supply chain management), and main-
tenance and re-tooling actors. The manufacturing services and applications
do not need to be deﬁned in an intertwined and strictly linked manner to
the physical system, but rather run as services in a shared physical world.
Adopting the industrial IoT requires a change in the way stakeholders design
andaugmenttheirindustrialsystemsinorderthattheIoTindustrialsystemsare
adaptive and scalable through software or added functionality that integrates
with the overall solution.
Industrial IoT applications are using of the data available, business ana-
lytics, cloud services, enterprise mobility and many others to improve the
industrial processes. These technologies include big data and business analyt-
ics software, cloud services, embedded technology, sensor networks/sensing
technology, wireless communication, mobility, security and ID recognition
technology, wireless network and standardisation. Security is very important
in industrial IoT applications that are processing the information from tens of
thousands of edge devices nodes. Faulty data injected into the system has the
potential to be as damaging as data extracted from the systems via data breach.
The convergence of microelectronics and micromechanical parts within a
sensing device, the ubiquity of communications, the rise of micro-robotics, the
customization made possible by software will signiﬁcantly change the world
of manufacturing. In addition, broader pervasiveness of telecommunications
in many environments is one of the reasons why these environments take the
shape of ecosystems.
The future IoT developments integrated into the digital economy will
address highly distributed IoT applications involving a high degree of

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
65
distribution, and processing at the edge of the network by using platforms
that that provide compute, storage, and networking services between edge
devices and computing data centres.
IoT applications integrate sensors/actuators and cyber-physical systems
offering new opportunities for new combinations of virtual, digital, physical
and mechanical work. The IoT and Industrial IoT are currently underlying the
far-reaching integration of Information Technology (IT: conventional com-
puters, operating systems, networking components and software platforms.)
and Operational Technology (OT: industrial control system and networks,
hardware and software that detects or causes a change through the direct
monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes and events in the
enterprise) [12, 13].
Some of the main challenges associated with the implementation of
cyber-physical systems in include affordability, network integration, and the
interoperability of engineering systems.
Most companies have a difﬁcult time justifying risky, expensive, and
uncertaininvestmentsforsmartmanufacturingacrossthecompanyandfactory
level. Changes to the structure, organization, and culture of manufacturing
occur slowly, which hinders technology integration. Pre-digital age con-
trol systems are infrequently replaced because they are still serviceable.
Retroﬁtting these existing plants with cyber-physical systems is difﬁcult

66
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
and expensive. The lack of a standard industry approach to production
management results in customized software or use of a manual approach.
There is also a need for a unifying theory of non-homogeneous control and
communication systems [71].
The industrial IoT is implemented in various forms, one is called Internet
of Things, Services and People (IoTSP) [27] were the focus is to develop
and enhance process control systems, communications solutions, sensors
and software for the IoTSP. These technologies enable the customers in
industries, utilities and infrastructure to analyse their data more intelligently,
optimize their operations, boost their productivity, and their ﬂexibility. IoTSP
is advancing by helping the IoT stakeholders and customers to develop their
existing technologies, while keeping sight of our enduring commitment to
safety, reliability, cyber security and data privacy. Developing and improving
process control system, communication solutions, sensors and software used
in IoTSP provide new value for the customers. With these technologies, the
customers in industry, utility, transportation and infrastructure can beneﬁt
from smart data analysis, optimized operation, and higher productivity and
ﬂexibility.
3.3.8 Smart Cities
Cities all over the world, from small regional communities to global mega hubs
and from cities with an ancient core to brand new developments, are currently
working on ‘Smart City’ initiatives to make them more efﬁcient, sustainable,
and more attractive to citizens and businesses and to encourage economic
growth. There are many obstacles to successful implementation of these plans,
and translating solutions from one place to another is difﬁcult.While every city
on earth is unique and has its own characteristics that will impact why, how
and which Smart City solutions may emerge, there are enough similarities
for it to be worth investigating how best practices for ﬁnancing, design,
implementation and operation can be shared and how industry can re-use
experience gained from earlier projects, for example. Key elements include
interoperability of data between devices and subsystems, information ﬂows
between project partners, ﬁnancing, risk management, etc. [57].
A Smart City is deﬁned as a city that monitors and integrates condi-
tions of all of its critical infrastructures, including roads, bridges, tunnels,
rail/subways, airports, seaports, communications, water, power, even major
buildings, can better optimize its resources, plan its preventive maintenance
activities, and monitor security aspects while maximizing services to its

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
67
citizens. Emergency response management to both natural as well as man-
made challenges to the system can be focused and rapid. With advanced
monitoring systems and built-in smart sensors, data can be collected and
evaluated in real time, enhancing city management’s decision-making [69].
There are a number of key elements needed to form a Smart City, and some
of these are smart society, smart buildings, smart energy, smart lighting, smart
mobility, smart water management etc. ICT forms the basic infrastructure;
varying from sensors, actuators and electronic systems to software, Data,
Internet and Cloud, Edge/fog and Mobile Edge computing. ICT is applied
to improve these systems of systems building up a Smart City, making them
autonomous and interoperable, secure and trusted. The interaction of the
systems and the connectivity strongly depend on the communication gateway
connecting the edge element data from sensors, actuators, and electronic
systems to the Internet, managing- and control systems and decision programs.
An illustrative example of a Smart City model is presented in Figure 3.25
[57]. This model has a mostly technical view, concentrating on how (sub)
systems interact with each other supported by telecommunications and infor-
mation technology. The city is divided into the built environment (including
homes, ofﬁces and shops and the devices within them), infrastructure-based
sectors (e.g. energy and waste) and service-based sectors (e.g. healthcare and
education). There is possible interaction between elements within any of these
subsystems as well as between subsystems. Smart city infrastructure sectors,
such as telecommunications, information technology and electronics, enable
and support this interaction. A common theme in the example Smart City
models is the use of sensors to collect data from the city, which, through
platforms, can be combined, stored, analysed and displayed. This provides
decision support for actors in the city who can then act and make changes,
the effect of which can in turn be measured [57]. The Smart City is not
only the integration and interconnection of intelligent applications, but also a
people-centric and sustainable innovation model that is using communication
and information technology and takes advantage of the open innovation
ecology of the city and the new technologies such as IoT, cloud comput-
ing, data analytics, human-human, human-machine, machine-infrastructure,
machine-environment interaction.
A Smart City is a developed urban area that creates sustainable economic
development and high quality of life by excelling in multiple key areas:
economy, mobility, environment, people, living, and government [77].
Identifying or developing sets of Key Performance (KPI) and other indi-
cators to gauge the success of Smart City ICT deployments. KPIs are required

68

to provide performance as seen from different viewpoints, such as those: of
residents/citizens (reliability, availability, quality and safety of services, etc.);
ofcommunityandcitymanagers(operationalefﬁciency,resilience,scalability,
security, etc.); and of the environment (climate change, biodiversity, resource
efﬁciency, pollution, recycling rates/returns). The indicators appropriate for

one city or context may not be the same for others. As such, there should
also be standardized guidance for city managers on selecting and using
KPIs appropriate to their particular situation. Requirements for standardized
risk assessment methodologies for critical infrastructure dependencies across
organisations and sectors [58].
3.3.8.1 Open Data and Ecosystem for Smart Cities
As main areas of application, smarter cities plays a relevant role, not only
because the impact in re-using and re-purposing technology that is neces-
sary (the number of deployed sensors) but also the increasing demand of
new services (by citizens). IoT applications are currently based on multiple
architectures, technology standards and seamless software platforms, which
have led to a highly fragmented IoT landscape. This fragmentation impacts
directlytheareaofsmartcities,whichtypicallycompriseseveraltechnological
silos (i.e. IoT systems that have been developed and deployed independently
for smart homes, smart industrial automation, smart transport, and smart
buildings etc.).
The operation of IoT applications for Smart Cities will be supported by the
introduction of an abstract virtualized digital layer that operate across multiple
IoTarchitectures, platforms (e.g. FI-WARE) and business contexts is required.
Smartcitiessoonwillfaceuptheneedforanintegratedsolution(s)(SmartCity-
OS) that globally can monitor, visualise and control the uncountable integrated
number of operations executed by diverse (and every day increasing) services
platforms using the sensor technology deployed in the cities.
The term “Open Data” in the context of Smart Cities generally refers
to a public policy that requires public sector agencies and their contractors
to release key sets of government data (relating to many public activities
of the agency) to the public for any use, or re-use, in an easily accessible
manner. In many cases, this policy encourages this data to be freely available
and distributable. The value of releasing such data is presumed to lie in
the combination of this and other data from various sources. This value can
be dramatically increased when the data is discoverable, actionable and
available in standard formats for machine readability. The data is then usable
by other public agencies, third parties and the general public for new services,
and for ever richer insight into the performance of key areas like transport,
energy,healthandenvironment.Inthiscontextthereisaneedtoensurethatany
standards or guidance in this area should not be prescriptive about particular
models, but encourage innovation in data re-use [58].

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications

The quality of IoT Data and the numerous IoT Data source provisioning
are important issues as there is an inherent need to generate semantic-driven
business platforms, o address the enabling business-driven IoT ecosystems.
These systems have to address functionalities for operating across multi-
ple IoT architectures, platforms and business contexts, to enable a more
connected/integrated approach to Smart City applications development.
Smart Cities are becoming one of the biggest ﬁelds of application for
IoT technologies. Cities are more and more full of devices equipped with
sensors, actuators and other appliances providing information that in the past
was either impossible or relatively difﬁcult to gather. Their main purpose,
among other functionalities, is to gather information about various parameters
of importance for management of day-to-day activities in the city as well
as for longer term development planning. Examples of such parameters are
information about public transport (real-time location, utilization), trafﬁc
intensity, environmental data (air quality), occupancy of parking spaces, noise,
monitoring of waste bins, energy consumption in public buildings, etc. [66].
Integrated IoT solutions deployed in the cities require addressing inter-
operability, security, privacy, and trust for all of the suppliers in the
Figure 3.27

ecosystem also have policies and safeguards that align to those of the
citizens.
The research priorities need to focus on common IoT architecture
approaches, IoT data modelling and schema representations, intra-domain
and CPS extensions that allows more robustness and extensible IoT plat-
forms with embedded software and applications enabling heterogeneous
systems to interact (systems of systems integration) across various verticals in
the city.
3.3.8.2 Citizen Centric Smart Cities IoT Applications
and Deployments
Public city environments are complex and large. The only possibility to
address these largescale, multi-subsystem projects is in a collaborative, open-
innovation context, where effort is required to align interests, shape opinions,
develop business models and provide a common, interoperable IoTtechnology
ecosystem. Cities are “used” by people, which play different roles on the
city (resident citizens, visitors and tourists, businesses, municipal services
employees, etc.). The focus on users and citizens can be orchestrated in
various dimensions: problems, awareness, participation, culture and digital
transformation [66].
In this context, there are numerous important research challenges for
smarty city IoT applications:
• Design and implementation of modular architectures enabling easy ways
to interface with already existing infrastructures by using standards,
protocol wrappers or other innovative means.
• Overcoming traditional silo based organization of the cities, with each
utility responsible for their own closed world. Although not technologi-
cal, this is one of the main barriers.
• Creating algorithms and schemes to describe information created by
sensors in different applications to enable useful exchange of information
between different city services.
• Mechanisms for cost efﬁcient deployment and even more important
maintenance of such installations, including energy scavenging.
• Ensuring reliable readings from a plethora of sensors and efﬁcient
calibration of a large number of sensors deployed everywhere from
lampposts to waste bins.
• Increasing the intelligence and ﬂexibility on end devices to support them
to take autonomous decisions, decreasing resource overloads such as
bandwidth and improving their management.

• Provide interoperability solutions that allows that interoperability can be
achieved at different levels with the goal of reaching fully interoperability
at data level for IoT platforms that operate inside the city and allows the
replicability of solutions among cities.
• DesignanddevelopmentofuniﬁedAPIsforaccessingdataindependently
of the protocols, APIs and models supported in the underlying IoT
platform in a machine readable way.
• Algorithms for analysis and processing of data acquired in the city and
making “sense” out of it.
• IoT large-scale deployment and integration.
3.3.9 Smart Farming and Food Security
Food and fresh water are the most important natural resources in the world.
Farming is a major economic activity in Europe [70], with about 12 million
farms in the EU-28 in 2010, 40% of the land area and 25 million people
dedicated to farming activities. In a European context with its popula-
tion increasing, achieving higher efﬁciency in food production is a top
priority.
Sustainable farming, producing more with less and with a smaller environ-
mental footprint, is an unstoppable trend that demands new technologies. ICT
technologies, and IoT in particular, will be crucial elements for meeting the
challenges of tomorrow’s sustainable farming, supporting the implementation
of smart/precision farming techniques aimed at improving the processes of
food production. Indeed, a lot of ICT research and innovation in farming is
happening nowadays around precision farming, although the beneﬁts of the
application of ICT technologies encompass the whole agri-food value chain
as presented in Figure 3.28: food processing, food logistics, wholesale/retail,
and ﬁnally the consumers.
One crucial aspect that cannot be overlooked, and which is transversal
to the whole agri-food value chain, is food safety and traceability: the
mechanisms to ensure and monitor those food products are healthy and safe, at
their highest possible quality speciﬁcations, throughout their whole lifecycle,
from farm to fork. Again, food safety can greatly beneﬁt from the application
of IoT technologies.
Farming 4.0, or IoT-based innovations applied to farming, has the potential
to boost rural areas and EU economy. The AIOTI WG06 Recommendations
Report [64], recently published, highlights the beneﬁts that the application of
IoT technologies can bring into the agri-food sector, along with the numerous

74

challenges that must be overcome to unleash their full potential in large scale
implementations.
Final IoT-based applications or solutions are enabled by the combination
of a number of technology building blocks or layers. Each of those layers
faces particular R&I challenges.
IoT applications in the farming sector are dependent on a number of
enabling technologies covering hardware (i.e. smart devices that may embed
sensors, actuators, communication gateways and other appliances), software
(which, embedded in the device, provides it with intelligence, autonomous
decision-making, etc.), network/cloud/communication technologies (includ-
ing the need of reliable, possibly broadband, data coverage in rural or remote
areas, and the growing trend of softwarisation/de-hardwarisation and locali-
sation of networks), and services for providing the functionalities needed by
the sector. In addition interoperability, standardisation and data management
(considering the value and the sensitivity of data generated at farms and
other parts of the food chain, but also the added value that comes from data
aggregation) are key R&I drivers that are applicable to all technology layers.
A report on smart farming [53] deﬁnes seven applications:
• Fleet management – tracking of farm vehicles
• Arable farming, large and small ﬁeld farming

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
75
• Livestock monitoring
• Indoor farming – greenhouses and stables
• Fish farming
• Forestry
• Storage monitoring – water tanks, fuel tanks
Smart farming will allow farmers and growers to improve productivity and
reduce waste, ranging from the quantity of fertiliser used to the number of jour-
neys made by farm vehicles. The complexity of smart farming is also reﬂected
into the ecosystem of players. They can be classiﬁed in the following way:
• Technology providers – these include providers of wireless connectivity,
sensors, M2M solutions, decision support systems at the back ofﬁce, big
data analytical systems, geo-mapping applications, smartphone apps
• Providers of agricultural equipment and machinery (combines, tractors,
robots), farm buildings, as well as providers of specialist products (e.g.
seeds, feeds) and expertise in crop management and animal husbandry
• Customers: farmers, farming associations and cooperatives
• Inﬂuencers–thosethatsetprices,inﬂuencethemarketintowhichfarmers
and growers sell their products.
The range of stakeholders in agriculture is broad, ranging from big business,
ﬁnance, engineering, chemical companies, food retailers to industry associa-
tions and groupings through small suppliers of expertise in all the specialist
areas of farming.
The end users of precision farming solutions include not only the growers
but also farm managers, users of back ofﬁce IT systems. Not to be forgotten is
the role of the veterinary in understanding animal health.Also to be considered
are farmers co-operatives, which can help smaller farmers with advice and
funding.
The following table provides an overview of the most relevant challenges
across the technology layers.

3.3.9.1 Business Models and Innovation Ecosystems
The deployment and adoption of IoT technologies and applications in the
farming sector need to address the different challenges and opportunities
created by the new business models introduced. A number of issues that have
to be considered are presented below:
• Provide evidence of the sustainability of the IoT-based business, both for
the supply (ICT) and demand (agri-food) sides. From the point of view
of the users, the quantiﬁable beneﬁt and proﬁtability must compensate
for the cost of the IoT solutions.
• A challenge, and at the same time an opportunity, is the possibility of
devising new, disruptive business models. Some traditional companies,
for instance, are already shifting their business to data-driven models.
• Stimulate and empower the role of consumers as key element/
beneﬁciaries of the IoT-enabled food supply chain

3.3 IoT Smart Environments and Applications
79
• Build trust around the smart farming technology made in the EU (for
example through a IoT trust label)
• Analyse the important role of farm advisory services in the context of
data-driven farming
• Foster the creation of digital farming innovation hubs, not only in EU, but
at regional/national level, to accelerate innovation and adoption, facilitate
the early exchange of best practice.
3.3.9.2 Societal Aspects
The complexity of smart farming and the proliferation of IoT technolo-
gies provided by various stakeholders or ecosystems requires consider-
ing the following social aspects when addressing the implementation and
deployments:
• Identify the lack of digital skills preventing the adoption of digital
agriculture in some EU regions, and take corrective action involving the
necessary stakeholders (cooperatives, regional administrations) in order
to prevent a digital divide in EU’s agriculture.
• Provide evidence of the positive impact of the digitisation of farming in
the EU’s rural economy.Analyse new potential relationships between the
rural and urban economies.
• Stimulate and empower the role of consumers as key element/
beneﬁciaries of the IoT-enabled food supply chain
• Promote transparency of the food production process and encourage data
sharing by farmers along agri-food value chain
• Take action to ensure that the beneﬁts of IoT reach all types of farms,
especially smaller and family-owned holdings, which constitute the vast
majority in Europe, and thus are of utmost socioeconomic importance
3.3.9.3 Coordination among Different DGs, Programmes
and Member States
Although H2020 can help by providing a spearhead or lighthouse in the
form of a Large Scale Pilot, a large amount of IoT take-up in the farming
sector will be happening in parallel under national or regional initiatives (and
thus in a smaller, more fragmented scale). Much of this technology take-
up can or will be facilitated by public investments of Structural Funds or
other funding sources managed at a national or even regional level, such as
EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, implementing
the Common Agricultural Policy 2014–2020, CAP) and ERDF (European

80
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
Regional Development Fund), the latter in regions with Smart Specialization
Strategies.
The active coordination of the different Administrations involved (EU,
national and regional) towards streamlining efforts and generating opera-
tional efﬁciencies can only contribute to maximize the chances of hav-
ing a vibrant smart farming ecosystem in the EU beneﬁtting users and
providers alike, as well as consumers and the European society and
economy.
National, regional and cities’PublicAdministrations can play an important
role as either users, infrastructure managers, procurers, initial demand facili-
tators or subsidizers. In this sense, it is important to consider the aggregation
of national and regional initiatives related to IoT for pre-commercial procure-
ment, deployment, coordination of R&I programmes, etc, and the exchange
of best-practices among leading Member States/Regions and followers/
laggards.
Following the IoT cross-cutting actions implemented in the H2020
Work Programme 2016–17, further collaboration in the design of new work
programmes is highly desirable among DG CONNECT, DG AGRI, DG
RESEARCH, DG MARE (to include aquaculture in the future actions), as
well as DG ENER and DG Health and Food Safety.
3.3.9.4 Policy and Regulations
In the context of the DSM, the barriers blocking widespread deployment
of IoT-based innovations in farming (including interoperability, connec-
tivity, and security) must be lowered. The agrifood sector should be no
exception in beneﬁtting from the more agile digital economy. In this vein,
policy makers could beneﬁt from a sound analysis of major threats: data
management and trust (ownership, rules for access, security, and, where
applicable, privacy), connectivity and internet access in rural areas, cost of
high accuracy positioning services, and digital literacy and skills, among
others.
In the context of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), whose
primary objective nowadays is market-oriented sustainable food produc-
tion, mechanisms could be designed to supporting the adoption of digital
technologies in farming uniformly across the EU.
Regulations regarding traceability and labelling should be addressed
to facilitate adoption of new IoT solutions for traceability at EU-wide
level.

3.4 IoT and Related Future Internet Technologies
81
3.4 IoT and Related Future Internet Technologies
3.4.1 Cloud Computing
The Cloud computing deﬁnition provided by the National Institute of Standard
and Technologies (NIST) covers the main features of the technology. The
deﬁnition states that the cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous,
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of conﬁgurable com-
puting resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort
or service provider interaction [25].
Figure 3.29 summarises the main aspects of cloud, characteristics, the
layered architecture and the standard service models. In the following, we
describe a few important aspects of Cloud. The architecture of Cloud can
be split into several layers: datacentre (hardware), infrastructure, platform,
and application. Each of them can be seen as a service for the layer above
and as a consumer for the layer below. Cloud services can be grouped in
three main categories: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). SaaS refers to the provisioning
of applications running on Cloud environments. Applications are typically
accessible through a thin client or a web browser. PaaS refers to platform-layer
Figure 3.29
Cloud paradigm [24].

82
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
resources (e.g., operating system support, software development frameworks,
etc.). IaaS refers to providing processing, storage, and network resources,
allowing the consumer to control the operating system, storage and applica-
tions [24]. IoT can beneﬁt from the capabilities and resources of cloud to
compensate its technological constraints (e.g., storage, processing, communi-
cation, etc.). Cloud can offer an effective solution for IoT service management
and composition as well as for implementing applications and services that
exploit the things or the data generated by the things. Cloud can beneﬁt from
IoT by extending its usage to deal with real world things in a more distributed
and dynamic manner, and for delivering new services in a large number of
real life scenarios.
Cloud computing provide a unique opportunity to unify the real, digital and
the virtual worlds. IoT enables the building of very large infrastructures that
facilitate the information-driven real-time integration of the physical world,
sensing/actuating, processing, analytics, with the digital, cyber and virtual
worlds on a global scale.
3.4.2 Edge Computing
Virtualisation of objects will push for the convergence of cloud computing
and IoT will enable unprecedented opportunities in the IoT services arena
[80]. The central idea is that IoT’s biggest transformation will be in shifting
power in a network from the center to the edge. Rather than devices and
users communicating through central hubs – mainframes or cloud based
management servers, IoT will allow devices to communicate directly with
each other, which is the implementation of the “democratic” vision of a
decentralized Internet [82].
The IoT layered architecture include the edge intelligence into the edge
computing/processing where all the data capture, processing is done at the
device level among all the physical sensor/actuators/devices that include
controllers based on microprocessors/microcontrollers to compute/process
and wireless modules to communicate. The intelligence at the edge sup-
ports devices to use their data sharing and decision-making capabilities to
interact and cooperate in order to process the data at the edge, ﬁlter it and
select/prioritize what is important.
This intelligent processing at the edge select the “smart data” that is
transferred to the central data stores for further processing in the cloud.
This allows including the Edge Cloud for processing data and addressing
the challenges of response-time, reliability and security. For real time fast

3.4 IoT and Related Future Internet Technologies

Evolution of IoT from centralised networks to distributed cloud [82].

84
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
processes, the sensor/actuator edge devices could generate data much faster
than the cloud-based apps can process it.
The use of intelligent edge devices require to reduce the amount of data
sent to the cloud through quality ﬁltering and aggregation and the integration
of more functions into intelligent devices and gateways closer to the edge
reduces latency. By moving the intelligence to the edge, the local devices can
generate value when there are challenges related to transferring data to the
cloud. This will allow as well for protocol consolidation by controlling the
various ways devices can communicate with each other.
As part of this convergence, IoT applications (such as sensor-based
services) will be delivered on-demand through a cloud environment [81]. This
extends beyond the need to virtualize sensor data stores in a scalable fashion. It
asks for virtualization of Internet-connected objects and their ability to become
orchestrated into on-demand services (such as Sensing-as-a-Service).
Computing at the edge of the mobile network deﬁnes the IoT-enabled
customer experiences and require a resilient and robust underlying network
infrastructures to drive business success. IoT assets and devices are connected
via mobile infrastructure, and cloud services are provided to IoT platforms to
deliver real-time and context-based services.
Data transmission costs and the latency limitations of mobile connectivity
pose challenges to many IoTapplications that rely on cloud computing. Mobile
edge computing will enable businesses to deliver real-time and context-based
mobile moments to users of IoT solutions, while managing the cost base
for mobile infrastructure. A number of challenges listed below have to be
addressed when considering edge-computing implementation [83]:
• Cloud computing and IoTapplications are closely connected and improve
IoT experiences. IoT applications gain functionality through cloud ser-
vices, which in turn open access to third-party expertise and up-to-date
information.
• Mobile connectivity can create challenges for cloud-enabled IoT envi-
ronments. Latency affects user experiences, so poor mobile connectivity
can limit cloud-computing deployments in the IoT context.
• Mobile edge computing provides real-time network and context infor-
mation, including location, while giving application developers and
business leaders access to cloud computing capabilities and a cloud
service environment that’s closer to their actual users.
• Mobile edge computing is an important network infrastructure compo-
nent for block chain. The continuous replication of “blocks” via devices

3.5 Networks and Communication
85
on this distributed data centre poses a tremendous technological chal-
lenge. Mobile edge computing reveals one opportunity to address this
challenge.
Edge computing refers to data processing power at the edge of a network
and in industrial IoT applications (i.e. power production, smart trafﬁc lights,
manufacturing, etc.) the edge networked devices capture data and process date
close to the source of performing “edge analytics” on the data. Edge computing
complement cloud computing, since an analytic model or rules are created in
the cloud then pushed out to edge devices. Edge computing is closely related
to fog computing, that entails data processing from the edge of the network to
the cloud.
For the future IoT applications it is expected that more of the network
intelligence to reside closer to the source. This will push for the rise of Edge
Cloud/Fog, Mobile Edge computing architectures, as most data will be too
noisy or latency-sensitive or expensive to be transfer to the cloud.
The previous IERC SRIAs have identiﬁed the importance of interoper-
ability semantic technologies towards discovering devices, as well as towards
achieving semantic interoperability.
3.5 Networks and Communication
The IERC SRIA intends to lay the foundations for the IoT to be developed by
research through to the end of this decade and for subsequent innovations to be
realised even after this research period. Within this timeframe, the number of
connected devices, their features, their distribution and implied communica-
tion requirements will develop, as will the communication infrastructure and
it is predicted that low-power short-range networks will dominate wireless
IoT connectivity through 2025, far outnumbering connections using wide-
area IoT networks [21]. IoT technologies are extending the known business
models and leading to the proliferation of different ones as companies push
beyond the data, analytics and intelligence boundaries, while everything will
change signiﬁcantly. IoT devices will be contributing to and strongly driving
this development.
Changes will ﬁrst be embedded in given communication standards and
networks and subsequently in the communication and network structures
deﬁned by these standards.
Further developments of networks and communication technologies are
required by the emergence of the Tactile Internet, in which ultra-responsive

86
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
and ultra-reliable network connectivity will enable it to deliver physical
haptic experiences remotely for different IoTapplications.TheTactile Internet
will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction through building
real-time interactive systems. The combination of Tactile Internet and IoT
applications will enable haptic communications at the edge and in the inter-
action between humans and machines, infrastructure and environment by
providing the medium for transporting touch and actuation in real-time i.e., the
ability of haptic control through the Internet, in addition to no haptic control
and data.
3.5.1 Network Technology
The development in cloud and mobile edge computing requires network
strategies for ﬁfth evolution of mobile the 5G, which represents clearly
a convergence of network access technologies. The architecture of such
network has to integrate the needs for IoT applications and to offer seamless
integration and optimise the access to Cloud or mobile edge computing
resources. IoT is estimated that will connect 30 billion devices. All these
devices are connecting humans, things, information and content, which is
changing the performance characteristics of the network. Low latency is
becoming crucial (connected vehicles or industrial equipment must react in
ms), there is a need to extend network coverage even in non-urban areas,
a better indoor coverage is required, ultra-low power as many of the devices
will be battery operated is needed and a much higher reliability and robustness
is requested.
5G networks will deliver 1,000 to 5,000 times more capacity than 3G
and 4G networks today and will be made up of cells that support peak rates
of between 10 and 100 Gbps. They need to be ultra-low latency, meaning
it will take data 1–10 milliseconds to get from one designated point to
another, compared to 40–60 milliseconds today. Another goal is to separate
communications infrastructure and allow mobile users to move seamlessly
between 5G, 4G, and WiFi, which will be fully integrated with the cellular
network. To support the increasing data rates and number of connected
devices in urban environments, mobile networks are increasingly dense and
heterogeneous in cell-size and radio access technologies (multi-RATs).
Applications making use of cloud computing, and those using edge
computing will have to co-exist and will have to securely share data. The
right balance needs to be found between cloud/mobile edge computing to

3.5 Networks and Communication
87
optimize overall network trafﬁc and optimize the latency. Facilitating optimal
use of both mobile edge and cloud computing, while bringing the computing
processing capabilities to the end user. Local gateways can be involved in this
optimization to maximize utility, reliability, and privacy and minimize latency
and energy expenditures of the entire networks.
Futurenetworkshavetoaddresstheinterferencebetweenthedifferentcells
and radiations and develop new management models control roaming, while
exploiting the co-existence of the different cells and radio access technologies.
New management protocols controlling the user assignment to cells and
technology will have to be deployed in the mobile core network for a better
efﬁciency in accessing the network resource. Satellite communications need
to be considered as a potential radio access technology, especially in remote
areas. With the emerging of safety applications, minimizing the latency and
the various protocol translation will beneﬁt to the end-to-end latency. Den-
siﬁcation of the mobile network strongly challenges the connection with the
core network. Future networks should however implement cloud utilization
mechanisms to maximize the efﬁciency in terms of latency, security, energy
efﬁciency and accessibility.
In this context, there is a need for higher network ﬂexibility com-
bining Cloud technologies with Software Deﬁned Networks (SDN) and
Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), that will enable network ﬂexibility
to integrate new applications and to conﬁgure network resources adequately
(sharingcomputingresources,splitdatatrafﬁc,securityrules,QoSparameters,
mobility, etc.).

the world of things into the developing IoT. Network users will be humans,
machines, things and groups of them.
3.5.2 Communication Technology
The growth in mobile device market is pushing the deployment of IoT
applications where these mobile devices (smart phones, tablets, etc. are seen
as gateways for wireless sensors and actuators.
Communications technologies for the Future Internet and the IoT will
have to avoid such bottlenecks by construction not only for a given status
of development, but also for the whole path to fully developed and still
growing nets.

88
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
The inherent trend to higher complexity of solutions on all levels will be
seriously questioned – at least with regard to minimum energy IoT devices
and services.
Their communication with the access edges of the IoT network shall
be optimized cross domain with their implementation space and it shall be
compatible with the correctness of the construction approach.
These trends require the extension of the spectrum in to the 10–100 GHz
and unlicensed band and technologies like WiGig or 802.11ad that are
mature enough for massive deployment, can be used for cell backhaul,
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication. The use of advanced
multi-/massive-MIMO technologies have the capability to address both cov-
erage and bandwidth increase, while contributing to optimize the usage of the
network resources adequately to real need.
The IoT applications will embed the devices in various forms of commu-
nication models that will coexist in heterogeneous environments. The models
will range from device to device, device to cloud and device to gateway
communications that will bring various requirements to the development of
electronic components and systems for IoT applications. The ﬁrst approach
considers the case of devices that directly connect and communicate between
each another (i.e. using Bluetooth, Z-Wave, ZigBee, etc.) not necessarily
using an intermediary application server to establish direct device-to-device
communications. The second approach considers that the IoT device connect
(i.e. using wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi connections) directly to Internet cloud/fog
service of various service providers to exchange data and control message
trafﬁc. The third approach, the IoT devices connect to an application layer
gateway running an application software operating on the gateway device,
providing the “bridge” between the device and the cloud service while
providing security, data protocol translation and other functionalities.
The deployment of billions of devices requires network agnostic solu-
tions that integrate mobile, narrow band IoT (NB IoT), LPWA networks,
(LoRA, Sigfox, Weightless, etc), and high speed wireless networks (Wi-Fi),
particularly for applications spanning multiple jurisdictions.
LPWA networks have several features that make them particularly attrac-
tive for IoT devices and applications that require low mobility and low levels
of data transfer:
• Low power consumption that enable devices to last up to 10 years on a
single charge
• Optimised data transfer that supports small, intermittent blocks of data

3.6 IoT Standardisation

• Low device unit cost
• Few base stations required to provide coverage
• Easy installation of the network
• Dedicated network authentication
• Optimised for low throughput, long or short distance
• Sufﬁcient indoor penetration and coverage
These different types of networks are needed to address IoT product, services
and techniques to improve the Grade of Service (GoS), Quality of Service
and Quality of Experience (QoE) for the end users. Customization-based
solutions, are addressing industrial IoT while moving to a managed wide-area
communications system and, ecosystem collaboration.
Intelligent gateways will be needed at lower cost to simplify the infras-
tructure complexity for end consumers, enterprises, and industrial environ-
ments. Multi-functional, multi-protocol, processing gateways are likely to be
deployed for IoT devices and combined with Internet protocols and different
communication protocols.
These different approaches show that device interoperability and open
standards are key considerations in the design and development of internet-
worked IoT systems.
Ensuring the security, reliability, resilience, and stability of Internet appli-
cations and services is critical to promoting the concept of trusted IoT based
on the features and security provided of the devices at various levels of the
digital value chain.
3.6 IoT Standardisation
In recent publications mapping emerging technologies to their Hype Cycle,
Gartner positions the IoT at the top of the “Peak of Inﬂated Expectations” [14].
The assessment is widely shared and is reﬂected by signiﬁcant IoT related
activities in companies of all sizes, in industry standards groups, consortia,
alliances and in the press and media. Many observers also remark on the
number of technologies, alliances and consortia across the IoT landscape and
agree that a consolidation is imminent. These expectations broadly align with
the lifecycle phases that Gartner’s model predicts for IoT. Gartner’s view is
that IoT will reach the “Plateau of Productivity” in 5–10 years – somewhere
around 2020–2025. On that basis, they anticipate that the period 2015–2019
will see a consolidation phase with a corresponding reduction in hype, a period
of intense development of standards, and a transition into a period of real
product development.

Standardisation will play a key role in the consolidation of IoT landscape;
since many of the beneﬁts of IoT will occur based on widespread adoption,
the development of global standards is pivotal to ensuring economies of scale
and impact.
The standardisation priorities for AIOTI WG03 [61] will be a focus
of European engagement and steering in the standardization process. In
collaboration with other AIOTI working groups, the focus will be to:
• Maintain a view on the landscape of IoT standards-relevant activities
being driven by SDOs, Consortia, Alliances and OSS projects.
• Provide a forum for analysis, discussion and alignment of strategic, cross-
domain, technical themes and shared concerns across landscape activities
• Develop recommendations and guidelines addressing those concerns
• Engage the IoT community in disseminating and promoting the results
and steering emerging standards
In collaboration with ST505, AIOTI WG03 will build an understanding of
SDOs, Alliances, and Consortia; their respective speciﬁcations, technologies,
and spheres of inﬂuence; and the breadth, depth and sustainability of any Open
Source Software, which has established a usage proﬁle.
The outputs of the landscape work will drive the WG03 program.Analysis
of gaps, divergences, common concerns, and major players will inform the
agenda of challenges to be addressed, guidelines and recommendations to be
developed and groups to be engaged with.
The following table provides the three key challenges the workgroup is
currently responding to.
AIOTI WG03 will support the implementation of the goals set by the EC
[16] and promote the use of open standards through actions that: (1) support
the entire value chain, (2) apply within IoT domains and cross-IoT domains

and(3)areintegratingmultipletechnologies.Thisisdonebasedonstreamlined
international cooperation, which enables easy and fair access to standard
essential patents (SEPs). In order to accomplish this goal several potential
challenges can be foreseen, which are presented in the following table.
3.7 IoT Security
Security needs to be designed into IoT solutions from the concept phase and
integrated at the hardware level, the ﬁrmware level, the software level and the
service level. IoT applications need to embed mechanisms to continuously
monitor security and stay ahead of the threats posed by interactions with other
IoT applications and environments. Trust is based on the ability to maintain
the security of the IoT system and the ability to protect application/customer
information, and as well as being able to respond to unintended security or
privacy breaches. In the IoT it is important to drive security, privacy, data
protection and trust across the whole IoT ecosystem and no company can
“do it alone” in the loT space; success will require organizations to partner,
value chains to be created and ecosystems to ﬂourish. Yet as loT users start to
bring more players, service providers and third party suppliers into their value
chain, tech ﬁrms and loT solutions providers will face increasing pressure to
demonstrate their security capabilities [10].
The worlds of IT and operational technology (OT) are converging, and IT
leaders must manage their transition to converging, aligning and integrating IT
and OT environments [12]. The beneﬁts that come from managing IT and OT
convergence, alignment and integration include optimized business processes,
enhanced information for better decisions, reduced costs, lower risks and
shortened project timelines. IT and OT are converging in numerous important
industries, such as healthcare, transportation, defence, energy, aviation, man-
ufacturing, engineering, mining, oil and gas, natural resources and utilities. IT
leaders who are impacted by the convergence of IT and OT platforms should
consider the value and risk of pursuing alignment between IT and OT, as well
as the potential to integrate people, tools and resources used to manage and
support both technology areas. A shared set of standards and platforms across
IT and OT will reduce costs in many areas of software management, while the
reduction in risks that will come from reducing malware intrusion, internal
errors and cybersecurity can be enhanced if IT security teams are shared,
seconded or combined with OT staff to plan and implement holistic IT-OT
security [12].

98
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
The evolution of connected devices as nodes to the IoT brings limitless
possibilities.As more and more everyday things are connected to the Internet –
medical devices, automobiles, homes, etc. – the long-term forecast for the IoT
is staggering: by 2020, there will be 212 billion installed things, 30 billion
autonomously connected things and approximately three million petabytes
of embedded system data, all of which combined are expected to generate
nearly $9 trillion in business value. IoT applications fall into three basic
categories [11]:
• Mobile or desktop applications that control IoT devices;
• IoT ﬁrmware and embedded applications;
• Applications on open IoT platforms (for example, apps built for Apple
Watch).
All of these applications need to be protected or they run the risk of undesirable
outcomes such as:
• Improper or unsafe operation of IoT devices;
• Theft of conﬁdential data, private user information or application-related
intellectual property;
• Fraud and unauthorized access to payment processing channels;
• Damage to companies brand image and deterioration of customer,
prospect and partner trust.
In the case of IoT, applications can be attacked in many ways, often involving
apps that ﬁrst obtain access to the IoT application, then start monitoring,
controlling, and tampering with the device.
Aholistic approach that involves the device, data, network and application
layers is required and the following chart summarizes key IoT security
components that must be considered [11]:
The following policy recommendations on net neutrality and IoT, given
the current relevance of net neutrality to the European policy debate, following
agreement of the Telecoms Single Market legislative package are given in [62]
and summarised below:
• Embed “safe and secure software” design and development methodolo-
gies across all levels of device/application design and development and
implement security into that life cycle at the same time.
• Design, deliver and operate adaptive and dynamic end-to-end security
over heterogeneous infrastructures integrating IoT, networks and cloud
infrastructures. It is recommended to use underlying standardised OS and
hardware security features where architecture permits. The deployment

should not be speciﬁc or propose a modiﬁcation of existing OS and
hardware already integrated by IoT.
• Develop best practices conﬁrming minimum requirements for pro-
vision of secure, encrypted and integrity-protected channel, mutual
authentication processes between devices and measures securing that
only authorised agents can change settings on communication and
functionality.
• Develop a “New Identity for Things” – To date, Identity and Access
Management (IAM) processes and infrastructures have been primarily
focused on managing the identities of people. IAM processes and infras-
tructure must now be re-envisioned to encompass the amazing variety of
the virtualized infrastructure components. For example, authentication
and authorization functions will be expanded and enhanced to address
people, software and devices as a single converged framework.
• Develop a Common Authentication architecture – by investigation of
a Secure Identity and Trusted Authentication mechanism, for example
one which takes into account different authentication standards and will
provide a single-sign-on solution for IoT applications moving between
different systems.
• Certiﬁcation – the certiﬁcation framework and self-certiﬁcation solu-
tions for IoT applications have not been developed yet. The challenge
will be to have generic and common framework, while developing
business speciﬁc provisions. This framework should provide evaluation
assurance levels similar to the Common Criteria for Information Tech-
nology Security Evaluation (IS0/IEC 15408), which should serve as the
reference.
3.7.1 IoT Security Framework based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Concepts
Large-scale applications and services based on the IoT are increasingly
vulnerable to disruption from attack or information theft. Vulnerability in
general terms is deﬁned as the opportunity for a threat to cause loss. A threat
is any potential danger to a resource, originating from anything or anyone
that has the potential to cause a threat. Clearly, speciﬁc and more intelligent
security solutions are required to cope with these issues, which if not addressed
may become barriers for the IoT deployment on a broad scale.
Swarm intelligence (SI) is such a technological area, which can inspire
the design of new IoT security solutions. A subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence,

3.7 IoT Security
101
SI studies the emergent collective intelligence of groups of agents based on
social behaviour that can be observed in nature, such as ant colonies, ﬂocks of
birds, ﬁsh schools and bee hives, where a number of individuals with limited
capabilities are able to produce intelligent solutions for complex problems.
Vulnerability and reaction to threats seem to be a common thread and IoT can
take inspiration from ant colonies, ﬂocks of birds, ﬁsh schools and bee hives
on how to react to threats.
IoT objects have more capabilities than the above examples; in fact, the
trend is towards distributed models, meaning that objects are becoming more
intelligent, capable of making their own authentication, authorization and
other trust management decisions. Nevertheless, by embracing principles of
swarm intelligence, IoT systems can react more effectively to threats. Clearly,
a group of IoT objects has more abilities and resources to process large
amounts of information in real time in order to prevent, detect and react to
perceived or real threats, as well as make decisions based on the acquired
information.
The idea is not to make the IoT objects mobile in order to physically group
objects when threats occur but to augment the intelligence internalized in each
object, with new kind of intelligence that allow the individual resources and
intelligence in objects to group. Not all objects need to group at all times.
Objects can group around one object identiﬁed as a point of attack or around
a path of objects.
Clustering is therefore an important area and has been applied in many
domains, such as spatial data analysis, image processing, marketing and pat-
tern recognition, etc. For example, ant-based clustering is a type of clustering
algorithm that imitates the behaviour of ants, with a perfect social organization
where each type of individual specializes in a speciﬁc activity within the
colony.
In IoT security, the purpose of clustering is to cluster IoT objects into
groups according to some predeﬁned rules addressing the issues inherent in
detecting and dealing with threats.
The essence of this concept can be best illustrated by the following rules of
separation, alignment, cohesion of the ﬁrst multi-agent algorithm developed
by Craig Reynolds in 1986 simulating swarm behaviour.
• Separation: going away from other agents. In the IoT context, this rule
would become preserving the distributed nature of the IoT system in
the absence of threats, so that individual resources can be focused on
the functions to be performed by each object. Unnecessary clustering

102
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
would consume resources and would even expose intelligence crowding
to attack.
• Cohesion: going to the centre of the surrounding agents. In the IoT
context, this rule would become steering resources and intelligence
towards one or several points of attack.
• Alignment: heading towards the same direction of other agents. In the
IoT context, this rule would become steering along a path of attack.
Complex behaviour can be programmed as rules, based on self-organization.
The basic concept is to deﬁne rules and constraints and let the IoT system
self-organize in the presence of threats. The self-organization properties may
help security architects and other professionals to discover new security
solutions.
3.7.2 Self-protecting, Self-optimizing and Self-healing
IoT Concepts
Self-protecting capability features opens up the possibility for IoT to be used
in systems that need to protect themselves from malicious attacks, because
security, privacy and data protection are at stake.
IoT may offer other capabilities in addition to self-protection, such as
self-optimization and self-healing. With enhanced swarm intelligence, IoT
objects are capable of cooperating and sharing resources efﬁciently. This
allows for solving numerous optimization problems, which are otherwise
difﬁcult to implement due to the large resources required. Self-optimization
capabilities mean that SI can be used in many IoTapplications, such as optimal
node localization, optimal coverage control, and a wide variety of intelligent
routings: shortest transportation path, best available channel at a point in time,
minimum energy consumption.
The use of swarm intelligence supported by edge technologies (such
as WSN), makes it possible to add more and more cognitive intelligence
totheIoTobjects,andatthesametimeaddincreasingswarmintelligencetothe
collaborative and connectivity space. Thus, IoT objects strive to improve to a
higher level of local intelligence, close to human intelligence, in order to
fulﬁl their function in a distributed manner, while the collective intelligence
is centralized in order to solve problems that are more complex.
Swarm intelligence allows IoT to adopt a wide range of solutions already
found in AI, data mining and robotics, so that IoT applications become more
robust, ﬂexible, adaptable, scalable and self-organized. The self-organization
property allows for the formation of swarms of various shapes and sizes.

3.7 IoT Security
103
Each IoT object, which is part of the swarm has an agent with just enough
knowledge about its object (such as position, speed) in order to engage the
object in collaborative tasks with other objects in the swarm. Thus, IoT objects
may be ﬁxed or mobile and the IoT objects may enter and leave the swarm as
necessary, without disturbing the meshing architecture of the IoT system. Self-
healing systems are another application of IoT. The self-healing property is
foundinsystemsthatdetectanddiagnoseproblems,andthusmustembedsome
form of fault tolerance. Fault-tolerance based on SI implies the generation of
alternative transportation paths and the recovery of faulty paths, so that the
information is not lost and need not be retransmitted.
3.7.3 IoT Trust Framework
Common IoT threats are presented in [47] together with requirements to make
the IoT secure, involving several technological areas. The common thread
seems to be the need for end-to-end security.
Trust and usability are very important success factors for IoT, the security
and privacy of which need to be addressed across all the IoT architectural
layers and across domain applications. Performance, complexity and costs
are all factors, which inﬂuence adoption in addition to those that engender
trust. While important progress has been made and actions have been planned
to address usability, there nevertheless remain a number of potential gaps in
the overall “trust” framework.
The adoption of ﬁne-grained authorization mechanisms allows for more
ﬂexible resource control and enables tolerance when fronting unknown risks.
In addition, IP security protocol variants for the IoT with public-key-based
cryptographic primitives in their protocol design such as Datagram TLS
(DTLS), the HIP Diet EXchange (DEX), and minimal IKEv2, can fulﬁl the
requirements of the IoT regarding scalability and interoperability. End-to-end
authentication, integrity conﬁdentiality and privacy are essential.
It is very important for all IoT objects to collaborate with each other and
with the environment in order to generate the most appropriate clustering for
the task at hand, whether that be optimizing functions, locating and isolating
attacked objects, alleviating damage, or healing. Objects’ trustworthiness is
therefore an important feature, which must involve addressing issues such as
security, user access, user credentials/authentication, privacy, disclosure, and
transparency. Developing an IoT trust framework addressing security, privacy,
and sustainability in IoT products and services, as well as emphasising,
“security and privacy by design” as part of IoT product and application

104
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
development and deployment, is an important research priority for IoT
activities.
It is important to keep in mind that all the technologies must be tai-
lored to the constraints of IoT scenarios and to the characteristics of IoT
devices, including limited memory, computing resources, security and backup
connectivity.
Block chain technology is useful as a transaction-processing tool that
can address trust and security issues and move towards open source and
security based on transparency allowing the democratization of trust. This is
done by holding a record of every transaction made by every participant and
having many participants verify each transaction, providing highly redundant
veriﬁcation and eliminating the need for centralized trust authorities.
3.8 IoT Enabling the Digital Transformation of Industry
IoT refers to an ecosystem in which applications and services are driven by
data collected from devices that sense and interface with the physical world.
Important IoT application domains span almost all major economic sectors:
health, education, agriculture, transportation, manufacturing, electric grids,
and many more. Proponents of IoT techniques see a world in which a bridge’s
structural weaknesses are detected before it collapses, in which intelligent
transportation and resilient electrical grids offer pleasant and efﬁcient cities
for people to live and work in, and in which IoT-supported e-applications
transform medicine, education, and business. The combination of network
connectivity, widespread sensor placement, and sophisticated data analysis
techniques now enables applications to aggregate and act on large amounts of
data generated by IoTdevices in homes, public spaces, industry and the natural
world. This aggregated data can drive innovation, research, and marketing, as
well as optimise the services that generated it. IoT techniques will effect large-
scale change in how people live and work. A thing in IoT can be an inanimate
object that has been digitised or ﬁtted with digital technology, interconnected
machines or even, in the case of health and ﬁtness, people’s bodies. Such
data can then be used to analyse patterns, to anticipate changes and to alter
an object or environment to realise the desired outcome, often autonomously.
IoT allows for tailored solutions, both in terms of production and services, in
all industry areas. IoT data analytics can enable targeted medical treatment
or can determine what the lot-size for certain products should be, effectively
enabling the adaptation of production processes as required. In the context

3.8 IoT Enabling the Digital Transformation of Industry
105
of manufacturing this would enable greater use of customised outcomes
rather than trying to predict mass market demand. The IoT can empower
people in ways that would otherwise not be possible, for example by enabling
independence for people with disabilities and speciﬁc needs, in an area such
as transport, or helping meet the challenges associated with an ageing society.
Those countries that anticipate the challenges while fostering greater use will
be best placed to seize the beneﬁts [6].
In order to address the totality of interrelated technologies the IoT
technology ecosystem is essential and the enabling technologies will have
different roles such as components, products/applications, and support and
infrastructureintheseecosystems.Thetechnologieswillinteractthroughthese
roles and impact the IoT technological deployment [35].
IoT ecosystems offer solutions comprising a large system beyond a
platform and solve important technical challenges in the different verticals
and across verticals. These IoT technology ecosystems are instrumental for
the deployment of large pilots and can easily be connected to or build upon
the core IoT solutions for different applications in order to expand the system
of use and allow new and even unanticipated IoT end uses.
There is a need to adapt research and innovation policies across a broad
range of sectors and applications with focus on exchanging the data from and
among the things and IoT platforms in an interoperable format. This requires
creating systems that cross vertical silos and harvest the data across domains,
which unleashes useful IoT applications that are user centric, context aware,
and are able to create new services and providing gains from improvements
in the base components of IoT, such as optimised wireless communications,
data processing, analytics, etc.
Swarm intelligence can inspire the design of new IoT security solutions.
In order to render this technology for IoT, it has to be ﬁtted according to
the IoT needs and as such more work is needed to understand limitations as
well as an effective and interactive way to promote the development of these
designs.
In applying the research and innovation, recommendations is important to
consider the good practices developed to help policy makers move ahead and
promote the positive elements of the IoT while minimising challenges and
ensuring broader goals, including the following [6]:
• Evaluate and assess the existing policies and practices to determine that
are suitably supportive of the IoT, and do not constitute unintentional
barriers to potential IoT beneﬁts.

106
IoT Digital Value Chain Connecting Research, Innovation and Deployment
• Promote the use of global technical standards for the IoT developed
by standards setting bodies or industry consortia in order to support
the development of an interoperable IoT ecosystem, while stimulating
the emergence of new systems, boosting innovation and reinforcing
competitiveness.
• As the communication technologies evolve, evaluate spectrum resources
to satisfy IoT needs, both current and future, as different elements of the
IoT, from machines to edge devices, need a variety of spectrum resources
that is ﬁt for purpose.
• Promote skills to maximise opportunities in the labour market and
support workers whose tasks become displaced by IoT-enabled and IoT
Robotic Things and systems, with adjustment assistance and re-skilling
programmes.
• Build trust in the IoT by managing digital security and privacy risks
in line with the global and European regulations and practices and by
developing aTrust IoTframework based on cross-border and cross-sector
interoperability of policy frameworks in the context of DSM.
• Support and further develop open data frameworks that enable the
reuse of government data sets and encourage industry to share their
non-sensitive data for public beneﬁt.
• Promote and support the development of identity for things to address
numbering, discovery, identity and access management. Flexibility is
needed for numbering as different services or IoT users may have
different requirements.
• Encourage the exploitation of the project results, support the private
sector innovation taking advantage of the IoT, and improve the conditions
for the creation of start-ups and IoT business models that are built around
the opportunities created by the IoT applications and large scale pilots.

industries” Jahangir Mohammed [1]
4.1 Global Food Production – Setting the Scene
Agriculture is of vital importance to feed Europe in a healthy way, while
Europe has also an important role in feeding the world. It is a large sector with
a big social and economic impact, e.g.:
• 43% of the EU’s land area is being farmed [2];
• The food and drink industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the
EU, representing 15% of EU manufacturing sector turnover [3];
• Agri-food logistics has 27% share in the EU road transport [4];
• Agri-food exports contribute to more than 7% to total EU exports in
goods [5];
• Europe is the largest exporter of agri-food products in the world, EU28
exports reached €122 billion in 2014 [5].
At the same time, the agri-food domain has to face very critical challenges, in
particular:
• Food security is a major issue, which will become even more urgent and
critical in the next decades due to the expected increase of the world
population and the growing economic wealth of emerging economies.
• In the meantime, we have already exceeded the carrying capacity of
planet Earth with the current way of agricultural production. Further
129

130
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
globalization, climate change, a shift from a fuel-based towards a bio-
based economy, and competing claims on land, fresh water and labour
will complicate the challenge to feed the world without further polluting
or overuse (Figure 4.1).
Figure 4.1 demonstrates the perpendicular paradigm shift needed. The right-
bound dashed line indicates the current trend of an increasing food demand
and the associated ecological footprint that is needed. Currently we are already
at the point in which this footprint is already too large (two times our planet’s
carrying capacity). Our challenge will be: more than doubling of the agri-food
production while at the same time at least halving our ecological footprint
(Source: Wageningen UR).
• Increasing consumer concerns about food safety by the continuing
sequence of food calamities, which have required massive product
recalls, sometimes even on a European scale. Recent examples include
the horsemeat scandal [6] and the E. coli outbreak [7].
• Agri-food supply chains are characterised by complex network structures
where many small and medium enterprises (farms and parts of the
processing industry) trade with huge multinationals in the input and retail
sector. At this, agri-food products are often considered as commodities
with cost-leadership as the dominant marketing strategy, resulting in low
proﬁt margins.
Figure 4.1
Food demand vs ecological footprint.

4.1 Global Food Production – Setting the Scene
131
• Sustainable food chains are becoming ‘license to deliver’: roughly one-
third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally
[8] and food products account for an important part of the emissions
produced by the transportation sector. The society does no longer accept
the extremely high waste of food and the big CO2 footprint of food
products.
• Growing attention for impact of food on health: consumers and society
are increasingly aware that there is a strong relation between food
consumption and so-called diseases of civilization, including obesity and
food allergies.
Automation and mechatronics has enabled huge steps forward in in production
efﬁciency, quality improvements and sustainability. For example, global crop
yield increased by 77% between 1961–2007 [9] and the total greenhouse gas
emissions of the primary production has been reduced by 23.8% in the period
1990–2012 [10]. The improvements are mainly accomplished by non-Internet
technologies, such as mechanisation of ﬁeld operations, breeding new vari-
eties, and more environment-friendly cultivation techniques. Yet, the sector
has to drastically increase productivity to feed the growing world population
and to satisfy their changing food demands. This must be accomplished while
at the same time agriculture is facing huge challenges in dealing with climate
change, becoming more resource efﬁcient, improving livestock conditions
(animal welfare) and creating a circular economy, reducing waste, guarantying
food safety and contributing to a healthy lifestyle of consumers.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is very promising for realizing new levels of
control [11–13]. It is expected to be a powerful driver that will transform
farming and food into smart webs of connected objects that are context-
sensitive and can be identiﬁed, sensed and controlled remotely [14]. As such,
we believe that IoT will be a real game changer in agriculture and the overall
food chain that drastically improves productivity and sustainability, because
it allows for [15]:
• Better sensing and monitoring of production, including farm resource
use, crop development, animal behaviour and food processing;
• Better understanding of the speciﬁc farming conditions, such as weather
andenvironmentalconditions,animalwelfare,emergenceofpests,weeds
and diseases, and creation of knowledge about appropriate management
actions;
• More sophisticated and remote control of farm, processing and logistics
operations by actuators and robots, e.g. precise application of pesticides

132
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
and fertilizers, robots for automatic weeding, or remote control of
ambient conditions during transportation;
• Improving food quality monitoring and traceability by remotely control-
ling the location and conditions of shipments and products;
• Increasing consumer awareness of sustainability and health issues by
personalised nutrition, wearables and domotics.
This situation is offering excellent opportunities for both the farm and food
sector itself as well as for IoT providers.
4.2 Smart Farming and Food: Where We Are Right Now
The industrialisation of agriculture has expanded a lot in the previous decades.
Farms and food companies are developing towards high-tech factories that
are increasingly characterised by large-scale production and intensive use of
technology. At the same time, those new IoT potentials are enabling new
business models that were before impossible to realise. For example, the
numerous startups that are following a basic trend to realise solutions that
are offering fresh produce as well as to realise a very short supply chain from
supplier to end-consumer [16], even leaving out steps of classical food chains.
Collaboration of business partners is becoming more dynamic, competition
for acquiring high quality produce at larger proﬁt margin is increasing and
delivery of information is rather a prerequisite for the realisation of innovative
business models. Subsequently, data-rich management practices enabled by
the IoT are of crucial importance for realising new levels of control resulting in
a new jump in productivity and sustainability [17]. Some important advances
in various domains (see Figure 4.2) pave the way for this breakthrough.
Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming
Precision Agriculture is about the very precise monitoring, control and
treatment of animals, crops or m2 of land in order to manage spatial and
temporal variability of soil, crop and animal factors. In the previous decade
so-called precision agriculture techniques have been introduced successfully
[18]. For example, using satellite data, tractors can be very precisely located
and steered making it possible to increase labour productivity especially
for bigger machines: a 24 meter broad spraying machine requires advanced
guidance equipment in order to avoid overlap and instability of spraying
booms. By precise application of pesticides and fertilizers efﬁciency is
increased, simultaneously reducing pollution.Another example from livestock

Future Internet technologies.
production is where RFID technology makes it possible for the amount of
concentrate feed to be based on measured milk production for each individual
cow. However, Precision Agriculture is adopted only by innovative farmers
and the intelligent usage of precision farming data is still rather limited. At
this, integration, ease of use and affordability are crucial bottlenecks [19].
Moreover, there are a lot of opportunities for the use of new sensors in the
ﬁeld and stables.
Smart Farming goes beyond the concept of PrecisionAgriculture by basing
management tasks not only on location but also on data, enhanced by context-
and situation awareness, triggered by real-time events. Real-time assisting
reconﬁguration features are required to carry out agile actions, especially
in cases of suddenly changed operational conditions or other circumstances
(e.g. weather or disease alert). These features typically include intelligent
assistance in implementation, maintenance and use of the technology.
Figure4.3summarizestheconceptofsmartfarmingalongthemanagement
cycle as a cyber-physical system. In this picture, it is already suggested that
robots can play an important role in control, but it can also be expected that the
role of humans in analysis and planning is further taken over by machines so
that the cyber-physical cycle becomes fully autonomous. Of course, humans
will still be involved in the whole process but probably at a much higher level
of intelligence.
This role of farming robots is recognized in the forecasted supplies of
service robots. It is expected that agriculture will be at the second place

for demanding new service robots for professional use in the period of
2015–2018 [20]. This trend of an increased availability of high-tech devices
will also facilitate to realise synergetic effects for IoTpowered solutions, while
different agri-food innovation ﬁelds can be considered as innovation drivers.
Smart Logistics: Food Traceability, Safety and Quality
Handling of food imposes the dimension of perishability upon all agri-food
chain steps when planning and managing transport and storage. Logistic
decisions need to be based on the underlying fact that quality characteris-
tics are changing over time and due to environmental conditions. Unique
identiﬁcation of individual food items is rather complicated in terms of
labelling, costs in relation to its value and real-world handling of food in
cases, pallets and shipments. Therefore, produce and related packaging units
are aggregated for being able to properly manage logistics, while virtualisation
of shipments and its items, cases and pallets directly facilitates forwarding and
storage.

4.2 Smart Farming and Food: Where We Are Right Now
135
The IoT provides sophisticated solutions for tracking and tracing as well as
for remote management of shipments and products from production to the end-
consumer. Figure 4.4 illustrates that such solutions allow supply chain actors
to monitor, control, plan and optimize business processes remotely and in
real-time through the Internet, based on virtual objects instead of observation
on-site.
Food companies are obliged by law to trace products back to their origin
and to track the ongoing location of products. This has forced companies
worldwide to implement coordinated traceability systems along the food
supply chain. However, food traceability is currently still often achieved
by conventional systems, focusing on a single company or a speciﬁc part
of the supply chain and using too basic technologies, e.g. product labelling,
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), email, paper trails [22]. Due to cost-beneﬁt
considerations, available RFID applications focus on container or pallet level,
while single items are identiﬁed by barcodes. In most existing systems,
traceability data are passed from one partner to the next one, while each partner
records the supplier and customer of speciﬁc products (‘one step forward
Figure 4.4
IoT enables the virtualization of agri-food supply chains: Example logistics of
fresh ﬁsh, adapted from [14].

136
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
and one step back principle’) [23]. There are some examples of Electronic
Product Code Information System (EPCIS)-based traceability systems, which
capture events of food items passing through a supply chain network, store
these on one or more EPCIS-repositories and enable querying these events
using appropriate security mechanisms [23–25]. Yet such solutions are still
often implemented rather as closed systems than as open solutions serving
dynamically changing business partners.
Sensor technologies are increasingly used for food safety and food quality
management [26–28].Temperature sensors for cold chain monitoring are com-
mon practice.Also sensors for other parameters including humidity, light, and
ethylene are increasingly used. Furthermore, the majority of applied sensors
are still ﬁxed sensors and data loggers that are used to determine the causes
of quality problems afterwards. The adoption of wireless sensors, especially
Bluetooth, Zigbee, Wi-Fi and GPRS, is still in its infancy. The affordability of
wireless sensors beyond temperature is a critical issue for wide-scale usage.
Furthermore, many promising sensor technologies are still in an experimental
stage of development, e.g. most chemical and bio sensors, electronic noses
and Lab on a Chip [29, 30]. As a consequence, the microbiological quality
is still measured in traditional laboratories, resulting in limited timeliness of
food safety information. There are also solutions that add predictive analytics
to quality monitoring solutions to determine remaining shelf life as well as to
actively inﬂuence ripening processes, e.g. [28, 31–33].
Smart Food Processing and Manufacturing
Food processing plants are currently very much centrally controlled, which
results in a limited ﬂexibility. Application of IoT in food factories will be
based on a more decentralised control concept. Machines become cyber-
physical systems with embedded intelligence and local data processing and
that communicate directly with other machines [34]. In such smart food
factories, machinery is increasingly autonomous, managing its own service
and maintenance requirements and adapting instantly to new production
requirements. This approach is promoted by recent initiatives like the Industry
4.0 and Factory of the Future.
Smart Food Awareness
Consumers’ trust in food, food production, the origin of food, and the actors
involved is a core requirement for the functioning of European food markets
and the competitiveness of industry involved. With the experience of scandals
in mind, consumers increasingly expect transparency on which trust can be

4.3 Farming, Food and IoT: Where We Are Going
137
build. Transparency is not meant to know everything but to create awareness
on the issues consumers are interested in, involving information on the safety
and quality of products and processes, and increasingly on issues around
environmental, social, and ethical aspects.
TheIoTisrapidlychangingthewayofcommunicationbetweenconsumers
and food businesses. Having this in mind, the SmartAgriFood project has
introduced a conceptual architecture for the Internet of Food and Farm [21],
which is visualized in Figure 4.5. This can be considered as a kind of backbone
for smart food awareness facilitating the feedforward as well as backward
communication, ﬁnally required for making information available.
The majority of consumers currently have access to a wealth of food-
related smartphone apps, including personalised nutrition advices, food
traceability, recipes and purchasing support (including webshops). These
applications are increasingly making use of connected sensors, wearables like
smart watches, equipment at home (e.g. refrigerators, weighing machines) and
outdoor equipment (e.g. in canteens, restaurants, super markets, ﬁtness clubs).
However, most consumer IoT applications related to food focus on speciﬁc
functionalities and data, while the information exchange with other systems
is limited.
4.3 Farming, Food and IoT: Where We Are Going
The previous section shows that, although there is a good technology base for
application of IoT in farming and food, so far current IoT applications and
technologies in the agri-food domain are still fragmentary and lack seamless
integration. Especially more advanced solutions are in an experimental stage
of development.
Operational applications are mainly used by a small group of innovators
and still focus on basic functionalities at a high granularity level. However,
we expect that this situation will change rapidly in the coming years. IoT
technologies are currently maturing fast and most recently, IoT is in the
spotlights of both users and technology providers in the farming and food
domain. As a result, important advancements will be achieved, especially
concerning:
• Ensuring the integration of existing IoT solutions with open IoT
architectures, platforms and standards;
• Scaling-up the usage of interoperable IoT technologies beyond the
innovators, including simpliﬁcation of existing solutions to ensure
attractiveness for the mainstream farmers and food companies;

4.3 Farming, Food and IoT: Where We Are Going
139
• Further improvement of IoT technologies to ensure a broad usability in
the diversity of the agri-food domain, e.g. different climate conditions,
crop and soil types.
These technology developments are expected to drastically advance the devel-
opment and application of the information technologies that were introduced
in the previous section:
• Precision Agriculture will be extended to Smart Farming, in which
a farm becomes a smart web of interoperable farm objects. A major
improvement that will be added, is the seamless integration of sensing
and monitoring, smart analyses and planning and smart control of farm
operations for all relevant farm processes (‘whole farm management
perspective’).
• TrackingandTracing systemswilldeveloptowardsend-to-endvisibility
and real-time tracking and tracing on a ﬁne granularity level, e.g.
up to individual products. Moreover, traceability will be increasingly
integrated with smart sensing systems and consequently add data about
product features, production methods, and ambient conditions.
• Food Safety and Quality Management systems will transform from a
defensive, reactive approach towards a proactive approach, in which food
chains can be monitored, controlled, planned and optimized remotely
basedonreal-timeinformationofabroadrangeofrelevantparameters.To
achieve this, more types of sensors will be put into practice, the timeliness
of sensor information will be increased, the interoperability and thus
end-to-end visibility of sensor data will be improved, more advanced
remote control will be realized by implementing new actuators, and more
intelligence will be added to food safety and quality management, for
example: early warning in case of food incidents, rescheduling in case
of unexpected food quality deviations and simulation of product quality
based on ambient conditions (resulting in e.g. dynamic best-before dates).
• Food Processing and Manufacturing will increasingly be transformed
into agile control systems in which processing machines function as
autonomous connected objects with embedded intelligence. This will
especially be achieved by integrating new and cost-effective sensors for
real-time monitoring of processing activities, ensuring machine interop-
erability, and implementing algorithms for early detection of food safety
and quality issues.
• Consumer Food Awareness will develop towards a fully consumer-
centric approach that combines IoT technologies for different application

140
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
areas, including Smart Homes, Smart Shopping, and Smart Health and
Leisure. These applications will combine food-related information from
different stakeholders for personalised food intake advices.
IoT allows for the decoupling of physical ﬂows and information aspects of
farm and supply operations [14]. Farming processes and food supply chains
can be monitored, controlled, planned and optimized remotely and in real-time
based on virtual objects instead of observation on site.
Hence, farming and food will be transformed into smart webs of con-
nected objects that are context-sensitive and can be identiﬁed, sensed and
controlledremotely.Thisisexpectedtochangeagri-foodprocessesinunprece-
dented ways, resulting in new control mechanisms and new business models
such as:
• Data-Driven Farming: IoT will help farmers to change from ‘man-
agement by gut feeling’ towards ‘management by facts’, which is of
crucial importance to survive its increasingly demanding business envi-
ronment. The IoT sensing and connectivity technologies allow to feed
decision-making tools with timely and accurate operational data.
• Circular Economy/Green Farming and Food: IoT will facilitate the
control of using and distributing resources and it targets at a new dimen-
sion of symbiosis within the sector of food and farms. Collaboration with
different industries can be facilitated that can supply their waste e.g. in
form of heat, water, pressure or fertilizer. While also classical symbiotic
systems like aquaponics will highly beneﬁt from new IoT enabled control
solutions facilitating distributed and autonomous operation.
• Autonomous Farm Operations: IoT will improve the connectedness and
intelligence of farm automation.As such it will enable farm equipment to
become autonomous, self-adaptive systems that can operate, decide and
even learn without on-site or remote intervention by humans. Examples
are automated precise control of farming equipment, weeding robots and
self-driving tractors.
• Demand-driven Farming: IoT will enable farms to adjust and very
accurately predict the volume and quality of supply by the precise and
timely monitoring and control of production processes, also considering
new interaction models that will communicate, feedback and predict
the demand stemming from business as well as consumer side. As a
consequence, farms can depart from the traditional supply-oriented, cost-
price driven, anonymous approach to a value-based, information-rich

4.4 Challenges
141
approach in which demand and supply continuously are matched, both
in ofﬂine and online distribution channels and combinations.
• Outcome-based Agricultural Services: IoT will signiﬁcantly improve
the possibilities to measure and control farm processes. As a conse-
quence, farming will increasingly shift from competing through just
selling products and services, to the ability to deliver quantiﬁable results
that matter to customers, e.g. crop yield, energy saved or machine
uptime [35].
• Urban Farming: IoT will support to situate fully-controlled indoor
food production in urban areas close to the consumers. It will com-
bine the advanced sensing and actuating technologies of IoT with new
cultivation technologies for indoor farming (especially hydroponics,
lighting).
• Agile Food Factories: IoTwill enable a decentralised and ﬂexible control
concept for food processing by adding food sensors, local data processing
and intelligence, and connectivity to food processing equipment.
• Virtual Food Chains: IoT will enable to virtualize food supply chain
management, which allows for advanced remote (re)planning, monitor-
ing and control capabilities and for new business models, for example:
specialised virtual orchestrators that provide added value services and
local-for-global trade by SMEs.
• Personalised Nutrition: IoT will allow for nutrition monitoring and
personalised advices by using smartphones, that make use of connected
sensors, wearables like smart watches, equipment at home (e.g. refrig-
erators, weighing machines) and outdoor equipment (e.g. in canteens,
restaurants, super markets, ﬁtness clubs).
4.4 Challenges
As seen in the previous sections, ICT technologies and IoT in particular are
rapidly changing farming and the food industry. They have the potential to
bring in the future, through large-scale deployments, huge beneﬁts in the
form of a more sustainable agriculture, ensuring food security with a lower
environmental impact and guaranteeing healthier food production. However,
reaping the full beneﬁts will require overcoming certain IoT related challenges
and barriers, both from technical and non-technical perspectives. At the same
time, these difﬁculties bring new opportunities for technological development
and value creation taking into account different types of stakeholders.

142
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
4.4.1 Technical Dimension
Speaking from a technical perspective, without trying to be exhaustive, the
application of IoT to farming and food chains faces a series of challenges [15]
such as:
Interoperability and Standardisation
Proprietary architectures, platforms and standards represent a barrier for the
wide adoption of IoT in the agri-food sector due to the risks associated to
vendor lock-in, incompatibility with other systems, etc. One of the challenges
in the agri-food sector is to properly capture its particularities in the deﬁnition
of new global, open standards and the alignment with existing standardisa-
tion initiatives from different stakeholders, stemming either from ICT (e.g.
facilitated by the ETSI) or from agri-food (e.g. AEF, AgGateway, AgXML,
GS1, ISO, UN/CEFACT) that need to be continuously aligned. In farming
and food applications, one has to take into account farm management and
traceability systems, agricultural machinery information exchange (including
ﬂeet management), and in general the speciﬁc data lifecycle (generation,
collection, aggregation, visualization).
Enabling IoT Devices
Many of the beneﬁts promised by IoT, including continuous and ﬁne-grained
monitoring of parameters and variables, will only come through technological
breakthroughs such as the increase of computational power enabling edge
computing/analytics, together with the drastic decrease of energy consumption
in sensors and actuators to become (almost) energy-autonomous devices.
The large-scale scope of farming applications also claims for more intel-
ligence in the devices deployed in the ﬁeld, including self-conﬁguration
and self-management capabilities. In traceability and food safety scenarios
there is a clear challenge in developing new and cost-effective sensors and
communication technologies, as for instance current biosensors, as well as
RFID and NFC tags are not always viable (compared to the cost of the
food product), in particular when targeting ﬁne granularity, possibly at the
individual product level. Further attention needs to be dedicated to the device
characteristics, since food is rather a commodity with low proﬁt margins
and short lifetimes. Compared to tangible products from other sectors (e.g.
clothing, furniture, multimedia), direct pairing of IoT with fresh produce is
rather impossible often-requiring additional packaging. IoT potentials are not
necessarily directly transferrable to food and farm, asking for additional efforts

4.4 Challenges
143
and costs, assuring that enabling IoT devices will neither be harmful to the
environment, nor the consumers.
Enabling Network, Cloud and Communications
Connectivity is essential for making the best of IoT. However, IoT-intensive
precision farming applications take place at food production (farms, aquacul-
ture facilities), which are located in rural areas, where broadband coverage
is still far too low, as only 4% of the rural European population has access
to 4G connectivity, compared to 25% in towns and cities [36]. The massive
deployment of smart devices will demand architectural changes in the com-
munication networks (even at the Telco level) able to cope with speciﬁc data
generation patterns and to rapidly adapt to changing trafﬁc situations, thus
bringing the need for advanced SDN/NFV technology.At the same time, agri-
food is asking for IoTdevices with a low power communication proﬁle, even if
this will reduce bandwidth and communication frequency, giving technologies
like LoRa already quite some attention.
Information Services
Generation and collection of data is just the beginning in IoT applications.
Extracting value from the data, in the form of meaningful and actionable
information for the users, is the ﬁnal goal. In this regard, although there
are already good application examples, information services in the agri-
food domain are still in an incipient stage. Short-term developments are
mostly aimed at decision support systems, based usually on rules engines.
More advanced data analytics, allowing for instance predictive modelling
and production planning based on the demand (thus enabling demand-driven
farming), are still a challenge in most agri-food applications. At this, object
data has to be combined with a wealth of (3rd party) archives such as
historical and forecasted meteorological data, satellite data, soil-, water- and
air-analyses, logistic systems, and data on prices, logistics, retail, food service,
and consumers, diets, etc. In this context, the usability of the information
services is also of high interest: farm management systems should be easily
adaptable to holdings of different sizes, and with a low learning curve for the
user,whilefacilitatinginteroperabilityforhorizontalandverticalcollaboration
of business partners in the agri-food chain.
Data Security
As explained in Section 4.3, farming and food chains (following the trend in
other industries) are becoming more and more data-driven, so data becomes

144
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
a precious asset. Indeed, the data captured by farming machinery potentially
conveys a large amount of information, which is critical to the farmers, such
as soil fertility and crop yield, so farmers must have strong guarantees on the
protection of their data, in particular in cases where such data is stored (and
possibly processed) in cloud-based services. As a consequence, many users
are currently concerned about data ownership, privacy and security, which
too often results in a lack of conﬁdence and a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude. On
the other hand, aggregation of data from different farms has the potential for
generating huge added value. However, farmers must understand clearly the
beneﬁts they will get from such aggregation, as well as having the guarantee
that their individual data is properly protected. In other words, Digital Rights
Management solutions must be brought to the farming domain, in particular
for scenarios of data aggregation and data sharing. This will also facilitate a
promotion of open data initiatives for agri-food purposes as well as enabling
an inter-sectorial collaboration.
From a technical security perspective, there are additional challenges to
be considered in the domain of trusted data: the integrity and authenticity
of the data generated and stored must be guaranteed. In traceability/safety
applications, this is relevant to the origin of the product as well as the
processing undergone, whereas in farming scenarios it is crucial, for example,
in insurance-related issues.Trustworthiness requirements demand challenging
solutions, such as low cost authentication mechanisms for devices/machines.
At the consumer side, security issues have to do more with personal
data, thus bringing privacy at stake. For instance, IoT applications related
to personalised nutrition imply privacy challenges because of personal and
behavioural data captured from wearables, smartphones, etc.
IoT Platforms
As outlined in [37], there are numerous IoT platforms, stemming from open
source initiatives as well as representing commercial IoT platforms. Besides
the challenges with respect to governance, connectivity, fragmentation, inter-
operability, and stakeholders, it is emphasised that the need for decision
support at the application level to capitalise on the IoT, requires a loosely
coupled, modular software environment based onAPIs to enable endpoint data
collection and interaction. This is speciﬁcally true for small- and medium-
sized companies representing the majority in farming as well as parts in
the food chain. A particular IoT empowered app might be enough to help
solving a very particular problem.Apps could help to process or interpret data
and make suggestions or give advice. For example: sensors in the ﬁeld are

measuring the condition of the soil and consolidate this data in an app that is
also predicting rain. As a consequence, the farmer is advised against spraying
his ﬁeld that day.
Therefore, the FIspace project has proposed an overarching architecture
for enabling such kind of interactions, resulting in a multi-sided business-to-
business collaboration platform [38], which is visualised in Figure 4.6. FIspace
uses FIWARE Generic Enablers (GEs) but has two particular extensions for
business collaboration: the App Store and the Real-Time B2B collaboration
core. These key components are connected with several other modules to
enable system integration (e.g. with IoT), to ensure Security, Privacy and
Trust in business collaboration and an Operating Environment and Software
Development Kit to support an ecosystem in which Apps for the FIspace
store can be developed. The FIspace platform will be approachable through
various type of front-ends (e.g. web or smartphone), but also direct M2M
communication is possible.
4.4.2 Non-Technical Dimension
Besides the (non-exhaustive) technical challenges introduced above, from a
non-technical perspective it is worth to mention other issues that are crucial

146
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
towards the full development of IoT applications in farming and agri-food
chains [15].
• Business models: the common trend towards data-driven value chains
opens the door to new, disruptive business models in traditional sectors
such as farming and food industries. However, the sustainability of IoT-
based businesses, both for the supply (providers of IoT technology) and
demand (agri-food users) stakeholders must be investigated, speciﬁcally
in the context of large-scale deployments. From the point of view of the
users, the quantiﬁable beneﬁt and proﬁtability must compensate for the
cost of acquiring, operating and maintaining the IoT solutions. Upfront
costs of acquiring the IoT platforms and services are currently a real
barrier preventing wider adoption, in particular by small-sized farms.
• Societal aspects: IoT-based solutions for the agri-food sector still must
prove their value massively to the users. IoT technologies enable to
capture large amounts of data nearly in real time. However, data must
be beneﬁcial to and useable for farmers and all the stakeholders across
the food chain. The beneﬁts of the technology must be brought to real
farming scenarios, thus dissemination and awareness are essential. An
added difﬁculty in this regard is the heterogeneity of the agri-food value
chain, including a large variety of holdings with many different sizes.
In addition, to get the full beneﬁt of IoT in farming applications it is
essential that the users have certain digital skills. Currently, half of the
EU population is not properly digitally skilled [36]. Thus, education and
training in digital skills is essential to avoid creating a digital divide in
the food and farm community. Farming cooperatives could play a key
role in this regard.
• Policy and regulations: policies will play an essential role in the
widespread deployment of IoT-based innovations in farming and food
chains. In line with the Digital Single Market strategy [39] of the
European Commission, they must help in lowering the existing barriers,
which are slowing down the adoption of IoT. Just to mention a few which
are directly related to some of the challenges/barriers mentioned above:
◦Formulating clear security/privacy policies for protecting the farm-
ers’data from unauthorised disclosure and for controlled and secure
access to authorized third parties
◦Supporting the faster rollout of broadband internet access in rural
areas.
◦Enhancing digital literacy skills and inclusion.

4.5 Conclusions
147
• Stakeholder involvement: We observe the changing roles of old and
new software suppliers in relation to IoT, big data and agri-food. The
stakeholder network exhibits a high degree of dynamics with new players
takingovertherolesplayedbyotherplayersandtheincumbentsassuming
new roles in relation to agricultural data, information and knowledge.
IoT in particular also entails organisational issues of farming and the
supply chain. Further technological development may likely result in
two supply chain scenarios from a stakeholder perspective. One with
further integration of the linear supply chain in which farmers become
franchisers. Another scenario in which farmers are empowered by IoT
and open collaboration. The latter would enable also small stakeholders
to easily switch between suppliers, share data with government and
participate in short supply chains rather than integrated long supply
chains.
4.5 Conclusions
The envisaged Internet of food and farm in the year 2020 is not just a
rudimentary vision, but a path for research, technological development and
most importantly for innovation. New IoT based solutions that are making
an optimal usage of digital devices and the virtual world in challenging
as well as harsh environments are promising a huge impact for agri-food
business, technology providers and last but not least for all of us as con-
sumers. Innovative solutions will pave the way helping to feed the global
population, reducing emissions and resource usage per kg of food as well
as avoiding empty trips of transport capacities with all its impact on CO2
emissions and infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, consumers can
become more aware of the overall agri-food chain that will help them to
make informed decision when selecting speciﬁc produce. This can enable
the opportunity to present consumers the full beneﬁt of premium, organic
and upcoming sustainable production methods as well as offer possibilities
of better handling fair trade for farmers, hence facilitating their informed
decisions.
As outlined before, the promising potentials of IoT technologies need
to be based on an integrated usage of existing and mature methodologies
and approaches that are already widely applied in the agri-food sector.
Especially precision agriculture, traceability and food safety are cornerstones
that are already part of the daily farm and food business practices. However,
technology is still fragmented and data-rich management practices are not yet

148
Internet of Food and Farm 2020
sufﬁciently in place, hampering to achieve a full extent of a symbiotic farm
and food systems that are aiming at a continued increase of yields as achieved
in the years before by non-Internet technologies. At the same time, IoT can be
the key enabler to handle issues in relation to climate change, animal welfare
and contributing to a healthy lifestyle of consumers.
Therefore, the potentials of an Internet of food and farm can enable
e.g. autonomous farm operations, demand-driven farming and production as
well as providing a personalised nutrition also based on virtual food chains.
This will require technological and non-technological advances, while related
difﬁculties will bring new opportunities for technological development and
value creation. On the one hand, we need to work on data centric issues
(e.g. interoperability, standardisation, security, service creation), while also
ﬁnding new solutions to classical problems of using IoT devices and wireless
communication in harsh and rural environments. On the other, heterogeneous
types of stakeholders need to be empowered with the right digital skills, while
policy and regulation have to be supportive in lowering barriers.
Finally, new and disruptive business models are in reach that will make use
of the data-driven agri-food chain. However, the sustainability of IoT-based
businesses, both for the supply (providers of IoT technology) and demand
(agri-food users) stakeholders must be involved, speciﬁcally in the context of
large-scale deployments for being able to mobilise a critical mass of end-users
and validate the related beneﬁts.

5.1 Introduction
Future manufacturing is driven by a number of emerging requirements
including:
• The need for a shift from capacity to capability, which aims at increas-
ing manufacturing ﬂexibility towards responding to variable market
demand and achieving high-levels of customer fulﬁllment.
• Support for new production models, beyond mass production. Facto-
ries of the future prescribe a transition from conventional make-to-stock
(MTS) to emerging make-to-order (MTO), conﬁgure-to-order (CTO)
and engineer-to-order (ETO) production models. The support of these
models can render manufacturers more demand driven. For example,
such production models are a key prerequisite for supporting mass
customization, as a means of increasing variety with only minimal
increase in production costs.
• Atrend towards proﬁtable proximity sourcing and production, which
enables the development of modular products based on common plat-
forms and conﬁgurable options. This trend requires also the adoption of
hybrid production and sourcing strategies towards producing modular
platforms centrally, based on the participation of suppliers, distributors
and retailers. As part of this trend, stakeholders are able to tailor ﬁnal
products locally in order to better serve local customer demand.

Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
• Improved workforce engagement, through enabling people to remain at
the heart of the future factory, while empowering them to take efﬁcient
decisions despite the ever-increasing operational complexity of future
factories. Workforce engagement in the factories of the future is typically
associated with higher levels of collaboration between workers within the
same plant, but also across different plants.
The advent of future internet technologies, including cloud computing and the
Internet of Things (IoT), provides essential support to fulﬁlling these require-
ments and enhancing the efﬁciency and performance of factory processes.
Indeed, nowadays manufacturers are increasingly deploying Future Internet
(FI) technologies (such as cloud computing, IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS) in the shop ﬂoor. These technologies are at the heart of the fourth
industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) and enable a deeper meshing of virtual and
physical machines, which could drive the transformation and the optimisation
of the manufacturing value chain, including all touch-points from suppliers
to customers. Furthermore, they enable the inter-connection of products,
people, processes and infrastructures, towards more automated, intelligent and
streamlined manufacturing processes. Future internet technologies are also
gradually deployed in the shopﬂoor, as a means of transforming conventional
centralized automation models (e.g., SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition), MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems), ERP (Enterprise
Resource Planning)) on powerful central servers) towards more decentralized
models that provide ﬂexibility in the deployment of advanced manufacturing
technology.
The application of future internet technologies in general and of the IoT
in particular, in the scope of future manufacturing, can be classiﬁed in two
broad categories:
• IoT-based virtual manufacturing applications, which exploit IoT
and cloud technologies in order to connect stakeholders, products
and plants in a virtual manufacturing chain. Virtual manufacturing
applications enable connected supply chains, informed manufacturing
plants comprising informed people, informed products, informed pro-
cesses, and informed infrastructures, thus enabling the streamlining of
manufacturing processes.
• IoT-based factory automation, focusing on the decentralization of the
factory automation pyramid towards facilitating the integration of new
systems, including production stations and new technologies such as
sensors, Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) and 3D printing. Such

5.1 Introduction
155
integration could greatly boost manufacturing quality and performance,
while at the same time enabling increased responsiveness to external
triggers and customer demands.
Within the above-mentioned categories of IoT deployments (i.e. IoT in the
virtual manufacturing chains and IoT for factory automation), several IoT
added-value applications can been supported. Prominent examples of such
applications include connected supply chains that are responsive to customer
demands, proactive maintenance of infrastructure based on preventive and
condition-based monitoring, recycling, integration of bartering processes in
virtual manufacturing chains, increased automation through interconnection
of the shopﬂoor with the topﬂoor, as well as management and monitoring of
critical assets. These applications can have tangible beneﬁts on the competi-
tiveness of manufacturers, through impacting production quality, time and
cost. Nevertheless, deployments are still in their infancy for a number of
reasons including:
• Lack of track record and large scale pilots: Despite the proclaimed
beneﬁts of IoT deployments in manufacturing, there are still only a
limited number of deployments. Hence manufacturers seek for tangible
showcases, while solutions providers are trying to build track record and
reputation.
• Manufacturers’ reluctance: Manufacturers are rather conservative
when it comes to adopting digital technology. This reluctance is inten-
siﬁed given that several past deployments of digital technologies (e.g.
Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), Intelligent Agents) have failed
to demonstrate tangible improvements in quality, time and cost at the
same time.
• Absence of a smooth migration path: Factories and production pro-
cesses cannot change overnight. Manufacturers are therefore seeking for
a smooth migration path from existing deployments to emerging future
internet technologies based ones.
• Technical and Technological challenges: A range of technical chal-
lenges still exist, including the lack of standards, the fact that security
and privacy solutions are in their infancy, as well as the poor use of data
analytics technologies. Emerging deployments and pilots are expected
to demonstrate tangible improvements in these technological areas as a
prerequisite step for moving them into production deployment.
Inordertoconfronttheabove-listedchallenges,IoTexpertsandmanufacturers
are still undertaking intensive R&D and standardization activities. Such

156
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
research is undertaken within the IERC cluster, given that several topics dealt
within the cluster are applicable to future factories. Moreover, the Alliance
for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) has established a working group (WG) (namely
WG11), which is dedicated to smart manufacturing based on IoT technologies.
Likewise, a signiﬁcant number of projects of the FP7 and H2020 programme
have been dealing with the application and deployment of advanced IoT
technologies for factory automation and virtual manufacturing chains. The
rest of this chapter presents several of these initiatives in the form of IoT
technologies and related applications. In particular, the chapter illustrates IoT
technologies that can support virtual manufacturing chains and decentralized
factory automation, including related future internet technologies such as
edge/cloud computing and BigData analytics. Furthermore, characteristic
IoT applications are presented. The various technologies and applications
include work undertaken in recent FP7 and H2020 projects, including FP7
FITMAN (www.ﬁtman-ﬁ.eu), FP7 ProaSense (http://www.proasense.eu),
H2020 MANTIS (http://mantis-project.eu), H2020 BeInCPPS (http://www.
beincpps.eu/), as well as the H2020 FAR-EDGE initiative. The chapter is
structured as follows: The second section of the chapter following this
introduction illustrates the role of IoT technologies in the scope of EU’s digital
industry agenda with particular emphasis on the use of IoT platforms (includ-
ing FITMAN and FIWARE) for virtual manufacturing. The third section is
devoted to decentralized factory automation based on IoT technologies. A set
of representative applications, including applications deployed in FP7 and
H2020 projects are presented in the fourth section. Finally, the ﬁfth section
is the concluding one, which provides also directions for further research and
experimentation, including ideas for large-scale pilots.
5.2 EU Initiatives and IoT Platforms for Digital
Manufacturing
5.2.1 Future Manufacturing Value Chains
The manufacturing Industry has recently evolved from rigid, static, hierarchi-
cal value chains to more ﬂexible, open and peer-to-peer value ecosystems.
Moreover, the added value produced by manufacturing (15% of the overall
GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in the 28 EU Member States) has dramati-
cally changed its pattern, where production and assembly of physical goods
has constantly decreased its value added, in favor of pre-production and
post-production activities.

5.2 EU Initiatives and IoT Platforms for Digital Manufacturing
157
The so-called SMILE challenge (Figure 5.1) is also emphasizing the
role of ICT in this radical transformation of manufacturing value chains.
In the central production stages, IoT is mostly at the service of Factory
Automation and represents the major vehicle for connecting Real World (and
its Cyber Physical Production Systems) with Digital-Virtual worlds in a green
sustainable economy; in the pre-Production stages, closed loop collaboration
ecosystemsfornewproduct-servicedesignaswellasDigital-to-Realworld3D
printing ecosystems have been enabled by IoT and support creative economy;
in the post-Production stages, new IoT-driven business models, supporting
service- sharing- circular- economy, have been developed with success with
the aim to compensate the loss of jobs derived from factory automation. For all
the stages, it is necessary to proceed with the formation of new competencies
and curricula centered on IoT and its related digital technologies, in order to
attract young talents to Manufacturing and to up- re-skill existing workforce
(blue and white collar workers).
Following paragraphs discuss the relevance of IoT in Manufacturing
Value Chains, in consideration of two major events, which have characterized
this year (i.e. 2016): the “Digitising EU” Industry policy communication
and the enormous success of Industrie 4.0 initiatives and projects. A bi-
directional convergence and innovation reference framework for digitizing
EU Manufacturing value chains through IoT adoption is also proposed.
5.2.2 Recent EU Research Initiatives in Virtual Manufacturing
In commissioner Oettinger’s speech at Hannover Messe on April 14th 2015,
four main pillars for Europe’s digital future were identiﬁed: i) Digital Inno-
vation Hubs; ii) Leadership in platforms for Digital Industry; iii) Closing the
digital skills gap and iv) Smart Regulation for Smart Industry.
On this basis, DG CNECT elaborated a yin-yang metaphor (Figure 5.2) to
pictorially represent the two main challenges for achieving a strong EU Digital
sector (against the GAFAUS dominance) supporting a pervasive digitalization
of EU industry. The “Collaborative Manufacturing and Logistics” FoF11 2016
call was partly focused on digital automation platforms for collaborative
manufacturing processes, i.e. addressing together the ﬁrst two pillars of
Mr. Oettinger’s speech: EU leadership in digital platforms to digitize EU
manufacturing and logistics industries.
Many of the new FoF11 projects (currently under Grant Preparation phase
in DG CNECT) are based on FIWARE and FITMAN Industrial IoT platform
(Figure 5.3) and will bring new ideas and contributions to the IoT (IERC)

Cluster in the next 2–3 years. They will also adhere and support AIOTI
WG11 Smart Manufacturing, which is currently chaired by EFFRA(European
Factories of the Future Research Association).
The convergence and coordination between IoT-focused projects (super-
vised by IoT European Platforms Initiative (EPI)) and other DG CNECT
initiatives such as the aforementioned FIWARE (FITMAN), many FoF ICT
projects such as I4MS BEinCPPS (based also on OpenIoT open source
platform) and CPS/SAE initiatives represents the real challenge in the coming
years for the IoT for Manufacturing domain of IERC.
In fact, the common research topic to be addressed by all the projects in
the area of IoT-driven Digital Manufacturing Value Chains lies in the inter-
relation between the different aspects of IT (Information Technology, in this

digital manufacturing and virtual manufacturing chains.
case represented by IoT and CPS areas) and OT (Operation Technology) tech-
nology (in this case represented by Manufacturing Industries): stakeholders,
reference architectures, platforms, physical and human resources, innovation
and business models.
5.2.3 Levels of Manufacturing Digitisation
The recent EU communication about Digitising EU Industry of April 19th
2016 is exactly addressing this key topic, which is also the key topic for this
interest group in IERC. The purpose of this Communication is to reinforce the
EU’s competitiveness in digital technologies and to ensure that every industry
in Europe, in whichever sector, wherever situated, and no matter of what
size can fully beneﬁt from digital innovations. The communication aims at
overcoming current barriers (e.g. high- vs. low-tech sectors, frontrunners vs.
hesitators EU Countries, micro vs. small vs. large multinational enterprises),
which prevents all EU manufacturing industries to achieve the following three
progressive evolutionary levels of digitalization:
• Digital Products: driven by the development of the IoT to smart con-
nected objects, it includes developments of markets like the connected
car, wearables or smart home appliances.

5.2 EU Initiatives and IoT Platforms for Digital Manufacturing
161
• Digital Processes: driven by the development of IoT-enabled CPS, it
includes Industrie 4.0, the further spread of automation in production
and the full integration of simulation and data analytics over the full
cycle from product design to end of life (circular economy).
• Digital Business Models: driven by service-oriented IoT-based busi-
ness models, it includes the re-shufﬂing the value chains and blur-
ring boundaries between products and services with the ﬁnal aim to
increase proﬁtability by up to 5.3% and employment by up to 30%
(in 2020).
According to the same EU communication, the achievement of this threefold
objective is enabled by Digital Platforms, i.e. initiatives aiming at combining
digital technologies, notably IoT, big data and cloud, autonomous systems and
artiﬁcial intelligence, and 3D printing, into integration platforms addressing
cross-sector challenges. In particular, leadership in IoT has recently seen
an investment of the Commission in demand-driven large-scale pilots and
lighthouse initiatives in areas such as smart cities, smart living environments,
driverless cars, wearables, mobile health and agro-food. The investment
will address notably open platforms cutting across sectors and accelerate
innovation by companies and communities of developers, building on existing
open service platforms, such as FIWARE. The accompanying staff-working
document on IoT outlines among others standardisation and regulation chal-
lengesandopportunitiesforIoTandtheroleoftheAllianceforIoTInnovations
(AIOTI).
The Digitising Industry initiatives are aimed at a pervasive adoption of
Information Technologies (IT) into Operations Technologies (OT), so they all
implement the IT→OT way to do it. There is another perspective of the same
topic (or the other side of the coin): the perspective of Manufacturing Industry,
from OT→IT migration journey. This viewpoint is mostly represented by
the German Industrie 4.0 and its subsequent EU-wide regional and national
initiatives.
5.2.4 Industrie 4.0 Principles for CPS Manufacturing
The key focus of Industrie 4.0 is in the adoption of Cyber Physical Production
Systems and in the consequent enablement of IoT and IoS applications
(Figure 5.4).
Recently, several analysts identiﬁed so called “Industrie 4.0 readiness
levels” to help manufacturing industries and especially SMEs to unleash the

162

5.2 EU Initiatives and IoT Platforms for Digital Manufacturing
163
full potential of digitalization of products, processes and business processes.
In its most recent publications and in its speech at the World Manufacturing
Forum 2016 in Barcelona, Max Blanchet, Senior PartnerAutomotive Industry,
ProcessandMaterials,RolandBerger,presenteditsmodelandtheundoubtable
beneﬁts to Manufacturing Industry, deriving from a full adoption of seven key
principles:
• From Mass Production to Mass Customisation.
• From volume Scale Effect to localized and ﬂexible Units.
• From planned Make to Stock to dynamic Make to Order.
• From Product to Usage.
• From Cost driven to ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) driven.
• From Taylorism to ﬂexible work organization.
• From hard working conditions to attractive work spaces.
The implementation of these seven principles in the manufacturing industry
implies a migration of its resources towards IoT and the new IT.
As underlined before, the main research issue to be addressed in the
Collaborative Digital Manufacturing Industry domain is the development of
a bi-directional, win-win symbiotic model between IT and OT, in this case
between IoT and Manufacturing. In this perspective, Europe is already playing
a leading role worldwide in several so-called Key Enabling Technologies
(KETs), such as micro- and nano-electronics, nanotechnology, industrial
biotechnology, advanced materials, photonics, and advanced manufacturing
technologies. When talking about bridging the Valley of Death between
Research and Innovation, even at the small scale, such KETs are able per
se to achieve a strong and immediate impact. In fact, in the ﬁrst and second
Phases of the I4MS initiative, some high-impact KETs (such as laser, robotics,
High Performance Computing (HPC) simulation and CPS) have been and
are being successfully transferred to Industry and SMEs in particular via
a consistent ecosystem of local, small scale, almost independent champion
experiments, grouped in Innovation Hubs. In the KETs domains, Technology
Transfer approaches are based on increasing the TRL at the supply side,
and on experimented lead-by-example success stories and best practices at
the demand side, in order to give evidence to the whole ecosystem of the
business beneﬁts achieved. Once the effectiveness of the new KETs has been
experimented on the ﬁeld, the main barriers to their full adoption are mostly
economic and ﬁnancial: where and how to ﬁnd the relevant resources to cover
the sometimes huge investments required.

164
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
5.2.5 Digital Manufacturing and IoT Platforms
In terms of IoT, several Reference Architectures and Digital Platforms have
been developed in diverse Research and Innovation actions at EU, National
and Regional level, with the common aim to digitize manufacturing and
logistics collaborative business processes. In the EC-funded FP7 and H2020
landscape, several R&I projects have been funded addressing the digitalization
of manufacturing and logistics industries, not just in the Factories of the
Future PPP (especially the recent C2Net, CREMA projects about Cloud
Manufacturing and the Product Service System cluster), but also in other
research environments such as Net Innovation (e.g. FIWARE for Industry,
FITMAN and the Sensing Enterprise cluster), Cyber-Physical Systems (e.g.
many H2020 ICT1 projects and the Smart Anything Everywhere cluster),
IoT (e.g., 2015 Clusterbook of IERC Chapter 5, the AIOTI WG11 Smart
Manufacturing and several “IoT for Manufacturing” workshops held at the
recent and coming IoT WEEK events), Cloud Computing and Big Data (e.g.
FIWARE PPP, IDS and BDVA) and even Technology Enhanced Learning (e.g.
the TEL cluster for Manufacturing).
Many of these initiatives have been presented during several workshops
organized along 2015 by DG CNECT. In particular, during the workshop of
5–6 October 2015, also initiatives not coming from EC-funded initiatives
have been successfully demonstrated and discussed, such as Industry 4.0
RAMI (Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0) [1], Virtual Fort Knox,
Industrial Data Space and the US Industrial Internet Reference Architecture
IIRA. More recently, the newborn BEinCPPS InnovationAction in FoF I4MS
phase II is aiming to integrate several of these platforms and to connect them
via RAMI reference architecture also to National/Regional initiatives such as
Virtual Fort Knox and Industrial Data Space.
However, the ﬂourishing in EU of such an ecosystem of Research-driven
IoT driven Platforms has not yet led to a successful and effective digitalization
of all the aspects and resources of manufacturing and logistics industries
involved in collaborative business processes: this is mainly due to the hetero-
geneity of the IT supply side (too many technologies and too many reference
architectures, impossible to integrate into a common digital platform) and
to the heterogeneity of the domains to be addressed and transformed in the
Industry demand side (not just production systems, but also organizational,
human resources, educational, business and just ultimately IT systems). Is
IoT properly addressing the issues of data ownership and IPR management?
Is Cloud Manufacturing a real opportunity for all manufacturing business
processes, also those to be executed in real time? Have performance and

5.2 EU Initiatives and IoT Platforms for Digital Manufacturing
165
security issues been solved? Is the Industrie 4.0 revolution based on CPPSs
easy to be implemented in low-tech SMEs may be located in Eastern EU? If
we look at the technological supply side, many of the above issues have been
“solved” with advanced ICT solutions, but are the manufacturing industries
ready for this revolution? Is there any Digital Platform to support their internal
transformations, evolution to the new technologies?
In fact, when speaking of IoT-oriented Digital Platforms unleashing the
full potential of collaborative business processes along the whole supply
chain of manufacturing and logistics stakeholders, the process of digitizing
industry requires complex, multi-domain and multi-disciplinary Large Scale
Pilots (LSP) and cannot be effectively supported by simply putting in place
mono-directional technology adoption initiatives based on increasing TRLs
and Technology Transfer approaches.
In the case of Large Scale Pilots for Digital Platforms, TRLs are in fact not
an absolute metric and often are dependent on contextual information, which
cannot be ignored, such as size, sector, domain, digital literacy, location of the
industries and their supply chains.
Moreover, as already said, often the activation of a huge ecosystem of
Technology Transfer experiments is not the most effective option to create
impact, in the presence of not well-prepared target industries and with respect
to more holistic approaches like the creation of cross-domain interlinked
regional ecosystems and Large Scale Pilots.
On the contrary, such a merely technology-driven approach risks to deepen
the Digital Divide among industries, by favoring the excellence of leading
edge champions, but offering inadequate support to lagging behind and low-
tech industries. If not well prepared and conducted just via a mono-directional
TRL-based technology transfer approach, DigitalAutomation risks to sharpen
the divide between Eastern-Western EU Countries; between high- and low-
tech sectors; between large multinational and local SMEs and mid-caps
manufacturing industries.
More recently, in particular inside the AIOTI WG2 Innovation Ecosystem
community led by PHILIPS and ELASTICENGINE, a new approach has been
proposed: the appropriate way to measure the impact of these early adopter
models would have to account for:
• The level of risk;
• The number of potential early adopters;
• Potential to yield data from early adoption; and ﬁnally
• The technology readiness.

166
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
We call them Market Adoption Readiness Levels (MARLs). This interesting
approach for the very ﬁrst time poses the increase of TRL as just one of the
factors (the fourth one) to achieve innovation and not the unique way to impact.
However, such an approach is mostly targeting consumer-centric and creative
industries and needs substantial improvements and extensions to be applied
to manufacturing domain, but in any case it is a quite promising starting point
for a holistic approach to digital transformation of EU industry.
5.2.6 Maturity Model for IoT in Manufacturing
As indicated in the following picture, a Manufacturing Adoption Readiness
Model:
• A ﬁrst dimension considers the size and the investment capability of the
manufacturing industry and its collaborative supply chain. Sometimes
micro enterprises ecosystems are the fastest and most disruptive innova-
tors, but they ﬁnd difﬁcult to create a real impact in the society, due to
scarcity of investments. On the other side, large multi-national industries
are seen as champions and archetypes for ICT-driven innovation, but
often their migration processes are slow and bureaucratic. Economic
feasibility and sustainability is the major maturity criterion addressed in
this dimension;
• A second dimension considers the sector and industrial domain and its
ICT awareness, where high-tech industries have already familiarity with
certain technologies and young talented employees well prepared with
respect to digital skills. On the contrary, low-tech industries heavily
depend on knowledge and experiences of aging workers and engineers
and the migration assumes in many cases the meaning of a generational
knowledge transfer. Social sustainability is the major criterion addressed
in this dimension.
• Athird dimension considers the political and societal environment where
the manufacturing supply chain operates. According to the Industry 4.0
readiness quadrant developed by Roland Berger consultants, four clusters
of EU Countries could be identiﬁed according to two orthogonal vari-
ables: the Industry 4.0 readiness index (including degree of automation,
workforce skills, innovation intensity and high value-added collaborative
value networks) and the manufacturing vs. GDP ratio (the target 20% in
2020 for EU-28 countries according to former Commissioner Tajani’s
agenda). Hesitators are countries (such as Spain, Portugal and Estonia,
plus presumably some EU associated countries like Serbia and Turkey)

5.2 EU Initiatives and IoT Platforms for Digital Manufacturing
167
with low readiness level and low GDP ratio; Traditionalist Countries
(such as Italy, Poland, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia) have a solid tradition
in manufacturing – high GDP ratio – but a low readiness level and
penetration of ICT into manufacturing industry; Potentialist Countries
(such as UK, France, Denmark and the Netherlands) are good in ICT
innovation but their manufacturing industry is not as developed as needed
to achieve a deep societal impact; ﬁnally Frontrunners Countries (such as
Germany, Ireland, Sweden and Austria) are leading edge environments
where manufacturing digital innovation and societal impact are both well
developed. Political sustainability is the major criterion addressed in this
dimension.
Areference architecture for IoT-driven Digital Industry Collaborative Ecosys-
tems could be inspired by the Industrie 4.0 RAMI, where hierarchical levels
(from single components, to devices, to the whole connected world) are
crossed with abstraction layers (from assets data, to information, to business
knowledge) along the lifecycle of product typology and product instances
(things lifecycle).
Aﬁrst dimension of the IoT RAMI (Figure 5.5) (hierarchical technological
levels, Y axis) considers technological assets and platforms, where Smart
Networks, CPSs, IoT, Cloud, Big Data and Applications Marketplaces are
considered.
This dimension is crossed with the second dimension (abstraction layers,
Z axis) of the different types of Connected Factory resources involved in
the migration processes: production resources, human resources, business
resources, organizational resources and IT resources.
The third dimension (lifecycle, X axis) represents the evolution of dig-
italization patterns from smart products and production shop ﬂoors (digital
inside, smart connected objects), to intelligent digitized M&L process (shop
ﬂoor automation, energy optimization, preventive maintenance), to new busi-
ness opportunities and innovation models (servitisation, sharing and circular
economy), enabled by the migration to ICT.
In conclusion, the success of IoT-driven Digital Manufacturing Value
Chains (Figure 5.6) depends on the simultaneous and coordinated implemen-
tation of a digitising Industry IT→OT roadmap aiming at increasing the TRL
of IoT solutions and to extend the number of early adopters and success stories
in manufacturing through Large Scale Pilots and of a migration to Industrie 4.0
OT→IT roadmap aiming at evolving manufacturing value chains’ resources
towards IoT and its technologies, by considering multi-dimensional maturity
models and reference architectures derived from RAMI 4.0.

5.3 Digital Factory Automation
5.3.1 Business Drivers
Globalization has created a new and unprecedented landscape changing signif-
icantly the way manufacturing companies operate and compete: one of ﬁerce
competition, shorter response time to market opportunities and competitor’s
actions, increased product variations and rapid changes in product demand
are only some challenges faced by manufacturing companies of today. As in
other domains, production market has deeply felt the effects of globalization
on all different layers [2–4]. The increasing demand for new, high quality
and highly customized products at low cost and minimum time-to-market
delay is radically changing the way production systems are designed and
deployed. Success in such turbulent and unpredictable environment requires
production systems able to rapidly respond and adapt to changing markets
and costumer’s needs. To capitalize on the key markets opportunities and
winning the competition for markets share, manufacturing companies are
caught between the growing needs for:

5.3 Digital Factory Automation
169
Figure 5.6
Manufacturing company functional hierarchical decomposition according to the ISA-95/IEC62264 standard.

170
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
• implementing more and more exclusive, efﬁcient and sustainable pro-
duction systems to assure a more efﬁcient and effective management
of the resources and to produce innovative and appellative customized
products as quickly as possible with reduced costs while preserving
product quality;
• creating new sources of value by providing new integrated product-
service solutions to the customer [5].
In order to meet these demands, manufacturing companies are progressively
understanding that they need to be internally and externally agile, i.e. agility
must be spread to different and several areas of a manufacturing company
from devices data management at shop ﬂoor level rising up to business data
management while going beyond the individual company boundaries to intra
enterprises data management at organization level. Therefore, agility implies
being more than simply ﬂexible and lean [6].
Flexibility refers to the ability exhibited by a company that is able to adjust
itself to produce a predetermined range of solutions or products [7, 8], while
lean essentially means producing without waste [9]. On the other hand, agility
relates to operating efﬁciently in a competitive environment dominated by
change and uncertainty [10].
Thus, an agile manufacturing company should be capable to detect the
rapidly changing needs of the marketplace and propagate these needs to the
lower levels of the company in order to shift quickly among products and
models or between products [11]. Therefore, it is a top down enterprise wide
effort that supports time-to-market attributes of competitiveness [12].
Thus, to be agile a manufacturing company needs a totally integrated
approach i.e. to integrate product and process design, engineering and man-
ufacturing with marketing and sale in a holistic and global perspective.
Such holistic and global vision is not properly covered in the manufacturing
company of today.
5.3.2 IoT Techniques for the Virtualization of Automation
Pyramid
The vision of decentralizing the automation pyramid towards gaining addi-
tional ﬂexibility in integrating new technologies and devices, while improving
performance and quality is not new. Earlier efforts towards the decentral-
ization of the factory automation systems have focused on the adaptation
and deployment of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) architectures for
CPS and IoT devices [13]. However, SOA architectures tend to be heavy-
weight and rather inefﬁcient for real-time problems, and therefore cannot be

5.3 Digital Factory Automation
171
deployed in the shopﬂoor without appropriate enhancements. Furthermore,
SOA deployments tend to focus on speciﬁc application functionalities and are
not suitable for implementing shared situation awareness across all shopﬂoor
applications. In recent years, the advent of edge computing architectures has
provided a compelling value proposition for decentralizing factory automation
systems, through the placement of data processing and control functions at
the very edge of the network. Edge computing is one of the most prominent
options for implementing IoT architectures that involve industrial automation
and real-time control [14]. Nevertheless, the adoption of decentralized archi-
tectures(includingedgecomputing)andIoT/CPSsystemsfrommanufacturers
remains low for a number of reasons, including:
• Lack of a well-deﬁned and smooth migration path to distributing
and virtualizing the automation pyramid: The vast majority of manu-
facturers has heavily invested in their legacy automation architectures
and are quite conservative in adopting new technologies, especially given
the absence of a concrete and smooth migration path from conventional
centralized systems to decentralized factory automation architectures.
The virtualization of the automation pyramid could greatly beneﬁt from
a phased approach, which will facilitate migration, while also ensuring
that the transition accelerates production, improves production quality
and results in a positive ROI (Return-on-Investment).
• IoT/CPS deployments and standards still in their infancy: IoT/CPS
deployments in manufacturing are still in their infancy. They tend to
be overly focused on unidirectional data collection from sensors for
remote monitoring purposes, while being divorced from the embedded
and real-time nature of plant automation problems. At the same time,
they tend to ignore the physical aspects of automation i.e. they pay
limited emphasis on CPS aspects. Furthermore, despite the emergence of
edge/fog computing architecture proposals for manufacturing (e.g., [14])
their implementation is still in its infancy.
• Lack of shared situational awareness and semantic interoperability:
There is a lack of semantic interoperability across the heterogeneous
components, devices and systems that comprise CPS-based automation
environments for manufacturing. Distributed IoT/CPS components pro-
vide non-interoperable data and services, which is a set-back to creating
sophisticated production automation workﬂows.
• Lack of open, secure and standards-based platforms for decentral-
ized factory automation: The distribution of automation functions in
the shopﬂoor is usually implemented on an ad-hoc fashion, which may

172
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
not comply with emerging architecture standards (such as the Refer-
ence Architecture Model Industrie 4.0). There is a lack of architectural
blueprints for decentralized factory automation based on future internet
technologies. Furthermore, emerging future internet platforms (such as
FIWARE) have a horizontal nature and are not built exclusively for
manufacturing domain (e.g., they do not address real-time requirements,
complex security requirements and physical processes that characterize
the FoF etc).
The advent of edge computing architectures, in conjunction with the emer-
gence of IoT/CPS manufacturing as part of Industrie 4.0, promise to provide
solutions for highly scalable distributed control problems which are subject
to stringent real-time constraints. In particular, edge computing architectures
are appropriate for processing or ﬁltering large amounts of data at the edge
of the network, as well as for performing large scale analysis of real-time
data [15]. A digital automation platform based on edge computing and IoT
technologies in the main objective of the H2020 FAR-EDGE project, which is
currently in its contracting stage. This platform will comprise digital models
of the plant, based on a proper compilation of reference/models and schemas
for the digital representation of factory assets and processes (e.g., IEC-61987),
notably reference schemas speciﬁed as part of RAMI. The platform will
achieve distributed real-time control and semantic interoperability based on
the replication and management of the state of the factory at the logical edges
of the network and in a trustworthy way. The digital model of the factory and
its secure sharing and distribution across the servers of the edge computing
architecture will provide a foundation for the development of an operating
system for factory automation, which could support a wide range of plant
automation and control activities.
5.3.3 CPS-based Factory Simulation
The successful deployment of IoT analytics technologies in the shop ﬂoor
hinges on the availability of digital datasets suitable for veriﬁcation and
validation of complex behaviors. The availability of such data cannot be taken
for granted. The development of simulation services based on appropriate
digital representations of plant could alleviate this limitation. Such simulation
services need to consider the IoT architecture of the digital automation system
along with the digital models of the representation of the plant.
The challenge lies not only to align the simulator with these models, but
also to enable their sharing and synchronization across different automation
processes.

5.3 Digital Factory Automation

5.3.4 IoT/CPS Production Workﬂows – Systems-of-Systems
Automation
The next generation of industrial infrastructures are expected to be complex
System-of-Systems (SoS) that will empower a new generation of industrial
applications and associated services that are actually too hardly to implement
and/or too costly to deploy [16]. There are several deﬁnition of a SoS in
the literature, however, the deﬁnition that best ﬁts the considered application
context/domain is is the one provided in where SoS are deﬁned as: [17]
“large-scale integrated systems that are heterogeneous and independently
operable on their own, but are networked together for a common goal. The
goal may be cost, performance, robustness, and so on”. The state-of-the-art
industrial automation solutions are known for their plethora of heterogeneous
smart equipment encompassing distinct functions, form factors, network inter-
faces and I/O (Input/Output) speciﬁcations supported by dissimilar software
and hardware platforms [18]. Such systems are designed, implemented and
deployed to fulﬁll two main objectives:
• To convert raw materials, components, or parts into ﬁnished goods that
meet a customer’s expectations or speciﬁcations.
• To perform the conversion effectively and efﬁciently to guarantee a
certain level of performance, robustness and reliability while keeping
the costs low.
To do that, coordination, collaboration and, thus, integration and interoperabil-
ity are extremely critical issues. Several efforts have been made towards the
structural and architectural deﬁnition and characterization of a manufacturing
company and its production management system as pointed in [19]. Among
the others, the most popular and still practical applied is the set of deﬁnitions
embodied into the ISA-95/IEC62264 standard (see Figure 5.6).
According to this standard manufacturing companies and their production
systems (process plus factory) are organized into a ﬁve level hierarchical
model also known as “automation pyramid”. Besides this representation, the
standard also provides a set of directives and guidelines for manufacturing
operations management such as primary and secondary processes, quality
assurance, etc. Even if the ISA-95/IEC62264 is the wider used approach
for modelling manufacturing companies, nowadays it does not show all the
intricacies of the applications, the communication protocols, and – more in
general – of the several solutions present at each one of the ﬁve levels.

Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
processing are not fully covered by the ISA-95/IEC62264 standard. In fact
it deﬁnes an information exchange framework to facilitate integration of
business applications with the manufacturing control applications within a
manufacturing company [20]. However, lower levels of the pyramid are not
addressed implying that the automation pyramid – as it is – has signiﬁcant
limitations regarding the increased complexity of modern networked automa-
tion systems [21], and – in particular – it has limitations when it is used to
support:
a) The integration of new technologies and devices and their lifecycle
management;
b) The handling of the information ﬂow along the overall automation
pyramid from the lower level to the higher ones (company visibility);
c) The handling of the information ﬂow coming from intelligent devices
spread all over the living environment that could be used as fundamental
feedback shared inside the automation pyramid.
The a), b), and c) limitations can be easily considered as different per-
spectives under the main umbrella of system integration research stream.
In manufacturing, system integration can be addressed and instantiated at
different levels of a company and, thus, with different levels of abstraction
according to the context of application [22]. Each level presents a peculiar
perspective about integration in general, and data integration in particular.
Current technological trends in both industrial and living environments are
pushing more and more to the idea of pervasive and ubiquitous computing
while offering – at the same time – a huge opportunity to link information
sources to information receivers/users. Future internet technologies – such as
IoT and CPS – facilitate the deployment of advanced solutions in plant ﬂoor,
as well as, day to day applications while promoting the meshing of virtual
and physical devices and the interconnection of products, people, processes
and infrastructures within the manufacturing value chain. The deployment
of IoT/CPS-based systems is enabling the creation of a common virtualized
space to facilitate the data acquisition process across multiple heterogeneous
and geographically distributed data sources while facilitating the collaboration
at large scale. It is necessary to comprehend that today’s problem is no longer
networking (protocols, connectivity, etc.) nor it is hardware (CPU/memory
power is already there, at low-cost and low-power consumption) but rather
it is on how to link disparate heterogeneous data sources – that are typically
acquired from distinct vendors – to the speciﬁc needs and interaction forms
of applications and platforms.

5.4 IoT Applications for Manufacturing
175
Designing and operating such complex systems requires from one side
the presence of a generic reference model together with models, descriptions,
guidance and speciﬁcations that can be used as key building blocks for
deriving IoT/CPS-based architecture. From the other side, the increasing
number of devices with advanced network capabilities is forcing the pres-
ence of intelligent middleware and more in general platforms where the
whole enterprise is part of and where its internal components/devices can be
easily discovered, added/removed/replaced and dynamically (re-)conﬁgured
according to the business needs during the system operations and especially
during the re-engineering interventions [16, 23, 24]. Several research initia-
tives and/or projects have been conducted to facilitate the interoperability
of heterogeneous data sources. The IoT-A (http://www.iot-a.eu) project has
addressed the IoT architecture and proposed a reference model as a response
toagalaxyofofsolutionssomehowrelatedtotheworldofintercommunicating
andsmartobjects.Thesesolutionsshowlittleornointeroperabilitycapabilities
as usually they are developed for speciﬁc challenges in mind, following spe-
ciﬁc requirements [25]. The Arrowhead (http://www.arrowhead.eu) project is
aimed to provide an intelligent middleware/platform that can be used to allow
the virtualization of physical machines into services. It includes principles on
how to design SOA-based systems, guidelines for its documentation and a
software framework capable of supporting its implementations. As a matter
of fact, one of the main challenges of the Arrowhead project is the design and
development of a framework to enable interoperability between systems that
are natively based on different technologies. Most of the speciﬁcations are
based on the models and outcomes provided by the FP7 IoT-A project.
5.4 IoT Applications for Manufacturing
5.4.1 Proactive Maintenance
As stated in [26], maintenance activities and procedures are always on high
pressure from the top management levels of a manufacturing company to
guarantee cost reduction while keeping the perfect working conditions of the
machines and equipment installed in a production system, and in order to
assure a certain degree of continuity in the productive process and – at the
same time – the safety of the people that are part of it.
To do that, several policies and strategies for maintenance have been
deﬁned, developed and adopted, namely:
• Corrective Maintenance (CM);
• Preventive Maintenance (PM);

176
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
• Predictive Maintenance (PdM); and
• Proactive Maintenance (PrM).
Infact,maintenanceowesitsdevelopmentessentiallytotheindustrialprogress
in the recent centuries and to the growing need for manufacturing companies
to be competitive [27].
Corrective Maintenance also called Run-to-failure reactive maintenance
is the oldest policy and envisions the repair of a failure whenever it happens.
It implies that a plant using run-to-failure management does not spend any
money on maintenance until a machine or system fails to operate [28].
Preventive Maintenance is a time-driven policy and envisions the
advanced deﬁnition of the time of intervention in order to anticipate the failure
of complex system [27]. In preventive maintenance management, machine
repairs or rebuilds are scheduled based on the mean time to failure (MTTF)
statistic [28].
Predictive Maintenance also called condition-based maintenance is a pol-
icy that envisions the regular monitoring of machine and equipment conditions
to understand their operating condition and schedule maintenance interven-
tions only when they are really needed. In predictive maintenance manage-
ment, machine repairs and/or rebuilds – i.e. maintenance interventions – are
programmed in real-time avoiding unforeseen downtimes and their related
implications [27]. As stated in [28]: Predictive maintenance is a philosophy
or attitude that, simply stated, uses the actual operating condition of plant
equipment and systems to optimize total plant operation. Finally, proactive
maintenance is a totally policy that is not “failure” oriented like the others.
As a matter of fact, proactive maintenance envisions not the minimization
of the machine/equipment downtime but the continuous monitoring of the
machine and equipment conditions with the main objective of identifying the
root causes of a possible failure and/or machine breakdown and proactively
schedule maintenance intervention to correct the abnormal values of the
root causes. Thus, in proactive maintenance policy the minimization of the
downtime is only the consequence of a strategy that is aimed to improve
the machine/equipment health during its lifecycle and to assure overall high
production system productivity, reliability, robustness while paradoxically
reducing the number of maintenance intervention [29]. Proactive maintenance
is a necessary state in the main path to effective maintenance. It has not been
thought as an alternative to predictive maintenance but as a complementary
approach to predictive maintenance in the direction of effective maintenance
(Figure 5.7).

5.4 IoT Applications for Manufacturing
177
The successful implementation of proactive maintenance strategies str-
ictly depends on the availability of an efﬁcient and effective monitoring infra-
structurethatcangatherrelevantoperationaldatafromthemachine/equipment
combine and analyze this data to identify possible breakdowns and their
root causes. However, current industrial monitoring and control solutions are
extremely “bit-oriented” making hard and painful the process of predicting
failures and detecting root causes. However, manufacturing companies are
betting on the application of intelligent and more integrated monitoring and
control solution to reduce maintenance problems, production line downtimes
and reduction of production line operational costs while guarantying a more
efﬁcient management of the manufacturing resources [30].
In this context, IoT/CPS technologies can enable the design and devel-
opment of advanced monitoring strategies and thus maintenance policies
by adding additional monitoring capabilities to industrial machines and
equipment providing in such a way the following functionalities:
• Integration of secondary processes within the main control: IoT/CPS
based technologies can be deployed in order to provide more data
about machine and equipment during their operation. Such information
can be used to model the machine/equipment behavior for the sake of
failures/breakdowns detection;
• Modernization of low-tech production systems: IoT/CPS based tech-
nologies can be deployed in low-tech production processes, i.e. produc-
tion processes that are not natively ready for industry 4.0, and make them
industry 4.0 compatible.
• IT/OT Integration: IoT/CPS technologies can easily provide data to
all the layers of the automation pyramid enabling a true cross-layer
integration.
• Maintenance engagement: IoT/CPS technologies can enable a better
engagement of the maintenance department in the health of the overall
production system.
5.4.2 Mass Customisation
The deployment of IoT technologies in virtual manufacturing chains and
decentralized factory automation systems enables reduction of the production
batch side and facilitates mass-customization. IoT devices can be deployed
across the supply chain (e.g., even at retail locations) in order to obtain insights
on customers’ preferences. At the same time, the ﬂexible integration of new

178
Internet of Things Applications in Future Manufacturing
technologies (such as stations, sensors and devices) facilitates the reduction
of the batch size. Overall, IoT supports mass-customization across all points
of the supply chain.
5.4.3 Reshoring
Decentralized IoT-based factory automation can enable European manufac-
turers to re-shore activities from low-labour countries back to the EU, which
could have a positive impact on both employment and GDP (Gross Domestic
Product). In particular, IoT enables reshoring through facilitating integration
with advanced manufacturing technologies (e.g., IoT, 3D printing, robots, etc.)
thus rendering manufacturing a far less labour intensive process. In this way,
IoT enables a shift of manufacturing from low labour locations to locations
with higher proximity to demand and innovation, which are the factors that
will determine future locations for manufacturing.
5.4.4 Safe Human Workplaces and HMIs
The scope of Industrie 4.0 includes the dynamic adaptation, reconﬁguration
and streamlining of manufacturing processes. This reconﬁguration occurs in
response to variations in demand, while taking into account the status of
the plant ﬂoor (e.g., machines, tools, control systems) in order to optimize
the production workﬂow. Nevertheless, such adaptive and reconﬁgurable
processes tend to neglect the human factor, given that they do not adequately
take into account the employees’proﬁle characteristics (such as age, disability,
gender and skills). For example, RAMI, does not make any provisions
for managing workforce proﬁles and human-centred processes. Likewise,
Industrie 4.0 roadmaps are overly focused on technological issues and pay less
attention on the ever important human and social factors (e.g., requirements for
human-centred manufacturing). Overall, factory workers (include elderly and
disabled workers) are still expected to fully adapt to the operations of machines
and automation systems, even in cases of manufacturing workplaces with poor
ergonomics.
In order to address these limitations, there is a need to devise technologies
and processes that could invert the above loop i.e. put factory automation in
the human workforce loop. Such technologies and processes could lead to a
number of important beneﬁts for manufacturers and for the society as whole,
including: (A) Optimal integration among human and technical resources
towards enhancing workforce performance and satisfaction; (B) Confronting

5.5 Future Outlook and Conclusions
179
the manufacturing skills gap; (C) Leveraging those individual worker capabili-
ties that are most advantageous to the manufacturing process, while addressing
important social factors (e.g., ageing and/or other handicapped groups) and
ensuring health and safety at work; (D) Introduction of new ﬂexible models
of work and organization. Overall, there is a clear need for blending leading
edge production automation technologies with state-of-the-art methodolo-
gies for human-centred processes and workplaces, including techniques for
the adaptation of the physical workplace to the workers’ characteristics
and skills.
IoT technologies can enable manufacturers to support advanced
ergonomics and novel models of work and organization through providing
support for the following functionalities:
• Human-centred production scheduling (notably in terms of work-
force allocation): IoT technologies (such as RFID tags) can be deployed
in order to provide access to the users’proﬁle and context, thus enhancing
conventional techniques for distributing tasks among workers in order
to take into account the (evolving) proﬁle and capabilities of the worker,
including his/her knowledge, skills, age, disabilities and more.
• Workplace Adaptation: IoT devices such as sensors and PLCs (Pro-
grammable Logic Controllers) can provide the means for adapting the
factory workplace operation and physical conﬁguration (i.e. in terms
of automation levels and physical world devices’ conﬁguration) to the
characteristics, needs and capabilities of the workers, with a view to
maximizing their performance and the overall productivity of the plant,
while also maximising worker satisfaction.
• Worker’s engagement in the adaptation process: IoT technologies can
enable the comparison of the performance of a worker in a given task
with the corresponding performance of skilled workers, in order to ﬁne-
tune the task distribution and workplace adaptation processes. Feedback
on the performance of workers will be derived based on RFID tags
and wearable devices, which can provide information about the workers
stress, fatigue, sleepiness, and more.
• Enhanced Workers’ Safety and Well-Being: The deployment and
use of IoT wearables (such as Fitbit devices) can enable the tracking
of the workers’ activity levels. Fitbit data can be accordingly used to
enhanced workers’ safety and reduce healthcare and insurance costs for
the manufacturers.

5.5 Future Outlook and Conclusions
5.5.1 Outlook and Directions for Future Research and Pilots
Previous paragraphs have presented a range of IoT technologies that can be
used for streamlining manufacturing operations and for decentralizing factory
automation. Despite the development of these technologies, there are still
technological challenges especially in the following areas:
• Security and Privacy: IoT data in the shop ﬂoor varies in terms
of volume and velocity, while including structured, unstructured and
semi-structured data sources. At the same time, IoT deployments in
manufacturing comprise multiple devices, which must be secured on
the network. Holistic multi-layer approaches to security are therefore
required in order to ensure safeguarding of personal data and control over
the ﬂow and exchange of sensitive information across the manufacturing
chains and/or the shopﬂoor industrial network.
• BigData Analytics: Manufacturers need to convert data into actionable
insight. Given the large volume of data, this is a signiﬁcant challenge.
The generation of business critical insights based on these data is still
in its infancy, since data stemming from the manufacturing environment
tends to be largely underutilized.
• Adoption of Edge Computing: Novel factory automation architectures
have been largely based on the SOA and Intelligent Agents paradigm,
in-line with standards such as the IEC 61499 Function Block. Emerging
edge computing architectures have distinct advantages for the imple-
mentation of decentralized architectures, yet they have not been widely
deployed yet.
• Need for Standards-based Reference Implementations: Recently,
standards based organizations (such as the industrial Internet Consor-
tium)haveproducedreferencearchitecturesforindustrialautomationand
the integration of digital enterprise systems in the manufacturing chain.
The provision of reference implementation of these standards will pave
the way for their wider adoption and sustainable use by manufacturers.
Beyond the need to address these technical challenges, there is also a need for
large-scale pilot deployments, which will combine several of the applications
outlined in the previous section, in a way that considers their interactions
and synergies. For example, proactive maintenance can give rise to effective
production (re)scheduling, which could be also driven by information about
customer demands (received via IoT devices). Likewise, IoT supported supply
chain operations can drive the reconﬁguration of production recipes, along

with the scheduling of production. Moreover, the development of human
centric workplaces requires the blending of adaptive human-centric processes
(including appropriate HMIs (Human Machine Intefaces)) into IoT based
factory automation architectures. Up to date, pilot deployments have been
addressingonlyafractionoftheabovelistedapplications,withoutasystematic
consideration of their interactions under the prism of a standards-based
reference implementation.
In addition to integrated pilots, large scale secure and privacy friendly
deployments need to be evaluated in terms of quality, time and cost. Manu-
facturers need tangible evidence and benchmarks about IoT’s ability to lead
to improvements across these three axis, in order to provide a compelling
proposition for adoption.
5.5.2 Conclusions
In this chapter, we have presented how IoT can transform manufacturing
towards aligning to emerging trends such as proximity sourcing, support for
ﬂexible production models, human-centred manufacturing and more. We have
also illustrated tangible deployments of IoT technologies based on recent
FP7 and H2020 projects, notably projects focusing on the factories of the
future.Despitethesedeployments,bothtechnologyandoperationalchallenges
exist. Reference implementation of standards compliant architectures for
digital manufacturing based on IoT technologies could successfully address
these challenges. Likewise, large-scale pilots combining the beneﬁts of IoT
deployments could also boost the confrontation of both technological and
business/operational challenges.

6.1 Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted a lot of attention the last decade due
to the unprecedented opportunities it provides for economic growth and for
improving the quality of life of citizens. The advances in the IoT domain have
been quite important and especially in the areas of IoT hardware, data and
context extraction, service provisioning and service composition, cognition,
interoperability and extensibility. Considering these advances, the IoT tech-
nologies are being considered quite mature for being deployed in real world
environments and this has already been done in many cities around the world.
Thousands of smart devices are now operating in cities, gathering information
and providing smart applications for e.g. environmental monitoring, energy
management, trafﬁc management, smart buildings and smart parking [1, 2].
These devices are equipped with intelligence and are able to monitor and
control physical objects, thus creating a new “Cyber-Physical” world [3].
The latest advances in the manufacturing engineering has allowed the
minimization of the size of IoT devices so that they are not easily noticed.

Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
Additionally, the humans are nowadays so familiar with computers and small
devices that do not even pay attention to them, considering them as a part of
their everyday lives. These two facts are proving how true for IoT was the
projection from Marc Weiser back in 1991 when he described the “computer
of the 21st century” using the phrase [4]:
The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They
weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are
indistinguishable from it.
It is easily understood that this phrase can characterize the IoT technology and
itsfutureinclusionwithintheeverydayactivitiesofthehumans.Theprojection
is that people will become so familiar with IoT that they will consider the
technology as part of their lives. Although this shows the huge potential of
IoT and its power, it raises signiﬁcant concerns regarding security, privacy and
safety. Imagine thousands and millions of small, unnoticeable devices spread
around in city areas and within buildings monitoring and logging the everyday
activities of people and controlling physical objects (doors, windows, cars,
trafﬁclights,etc.)[5].Thiscanbequiteworryingfortheprivacyofthepeopleif
theIoTsystemsarenotdesignedtobesecureandprivacypreserving.However,
IoTis also susceptible to attacks against the safety of the people, if the actuators
are faulty or being hacked [6].
In this respect, there is increasing attention lately towards designing
and developing fully secure and privacy preserving IoT systems. The main
requirements for secure IoT systems are: (i) to exchange information from
the devices to the applications in a secure way, (ii) to safeguard users’ and
citizens’ private information, and (iii) to provide reliable information. To
meet these requirements, IoT systems have to include from their design phase
functionalities for secure device conﬁguration, encryption, conﬁdentiality,
device and user authentication and access control, integrity protection, data
minimization, etc. All these functionalities have to be included in the design
phase of the IoTsystems, because any post-mortem corrections will only cover
some holes but won’t provide full-scale security [7].
In the previous two versions of the IERC book [8, 9], we have extensively
covered the areas of security and privacy in IoT. In this chapter we will focus
on another very important area for ensuring the provision of reliable infor-
mation and for maximizing the security, privacy and safety of IoT: “Trust”.
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: in Section 6.2 the
basic concepts of trust in the IoT are described, together with the reasons for

Section 6.10 concludes the chapter.
6.2 The Need for Evaluating Trust in IoT
Trust is a very important concept for IoT since it can affect the adoption of the
IoT systems by the humans. It is reasonable to assume that if the humans
do not trust an IoT system and its components, they will not be willing
to use it. The same stands for the service providers, the municipalities, the
companies, and all kinds of IoT stakeholders. If they are not convinced that
the IoT systems are reliable, they will not be willing to invest in them. Trust
is closely interconnected with reliability and reputation. In Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) the concept of trust has been considered
crucial for any digital interaction between multiple entities.
The concept of Trust can be deﬁned as the level of conﬁdence that an
entity has on another entity to behave certainly in a given situation [10]. Up
to recently, the notion of Trust was only used for humans, but lately it is also
associated with machines, devices and software. Here, we also have to make
a distinction between Trust and Trustworthiness. Trust can be considered as
subjective, because it is a belief of an entity (user, device, etc.) that another
entity is functioning according to some predeﬁned criteria, and these criteria
are subjective to the former entity. On the contrary, Trustworthiness, which
is an abstract concept, is considered as objective, because it is described
as a metric of how much an entity deserves the trust of other entities [11].
This metric is built upon several criteria, i.e. evidence of current and past
behaviour, availability, data reliability, security, etc. Trustworthiness can also
be calculated as “absolute” or as “relative” to other entities. For example, we
can say that a device is trustworthy in general or that it is more trustworthy
than its neighbours [12].
Another very important concept is the “Reputation” of an entity [13].
Although sometimes it is used interchangeably with trustworthiness, reputa-
tion is considered as an estimator of the trustworthiness of an entity according

188
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
to the criteria of another entity. Since the trustworthiness of an entity is very
difﬁcult to be evaluated, the metric that is widely used instead is the reputation.
In order to calculate the reputation of an entity, the metrics of multiple other
entities are fused and compared according to certain criteria.
As mentioned above, IoT systems have to be trustworthy so that they are
adopted by all stakeholders. The trust in the IoT domain can be considered
at many scenarios which include information exchange between the various
entities of the system. Since users and devices are exchanging information
between each other, we can consider trust (i) from users to devices that
send them information, (ii) from devices to users that send actuating com-
mands, and (iii) between devices that exchange information and actuating
commands.
For example, in Machine-to-Machine type communications (M2M) the
devices that are exchanging information have to know the reputation of other
devices so that only the devices that are trustworthy will handle sensitive
or critical information. So, in a scenario where a temperature sensor sends
commands to the air-conditioning system to turn on the heating because the
temperature in the room is very low, the air-conditioning should be sure that
the temperature sensor is trustworthy in order to execute the command.
Furthermore, only trusted users have to be allowed to manage critical
data or actuators. This is quite important, because in a scenario involving
controlling of physical objects, e.g. doors, windows or even ﬁre-extinguishers,
malicious (untrusted) users may create incidents against the safety of other
users. However, since in the IoT devices are also able to control other devices,
these incidents can also occur not only by user actions (i.e. hacking devices),
but also by faulty or malfunctioning devices.
Another scenario can be assumed when users are receiving measurements
from devices, i.e. measurements for trafﬁc in the center of the city in order to
identify the fastest route towards their work. If the system does not provide
them reliable trafﬁc information, the users will stop using this system, because
they will not trust it.
Apart from the previous examples that are mostly related to providing
reliable applications and services, trust in the IoT can also be related to
the reliable conﬁguration of the various system components. One such exam-
plewillbegiveninSection9.6.Trustcanbeincludedinalltypesofcooperative
networking mechanisms, for example as described in [14] in cooperative
spectrum sensing and assignment, where measurements from various devices
are fused in a gateway for identifying spectrum opportunities and for deciding
which is the best spectrum portion to operate on. Any measurements from

6.3 Trust Management in IoT 189
untrusted sources may affect the decision of the system and may result in
degraded system performance.
It is evident that considering Trust in the design of an IoT system is of
outmost importance for improving its reliability, its security and the safety of
its users. In the next sections we will discuss the recent approaches within
IERC for evaluating and managing trust in IoT systems.
6.3 Trust Management in IoT
The main objective of a Trust management system in IoT is to be able to
evaluate the trustworthiness of various components of the system and to use
these values in order to provide reputation information to users of the IoT
services or to internal conﬁguration services.
Trust management systems use trust and reputation models that are based
on ﬁve generic steps, as described in [15] and also discussed in [12]. The main
goal is to enable one entity (human or device user or a service) to identify the
entity or group of entities that are more trustworthy for a certain transaction,
based on speciﬁc criteria. As described in [16] any IoT trust model should be
designed according to the following:
• Observation: This step is the most important step since it is responsible
for monitoring the parameters of the system entities and their behaviour,
allowing the extraction of results with regards to the trustworthiness of
the entities. The monitoring of these parameters can be performed by
the system devices or by speciﬁc entities that are called observers. The
collected information can originate from standalone observers or from
groups of observers, which then fuse the information for extracting more
objective results.
• Scoring: When the observers gather the information for an entity they
can give it a proper weight which will result in a reputation score. This
will be done for all entities in the system (considering that adequate
information has been gathered). This reputation score can be given by an
interested agent or a centralized entity or by many entities collectively.
Finally, the reputation scores can be used in order to rank the entities in
terms of trustworthiness according to some criteria.
• Selection: Once the reputation scores and ranks are in place, the next step
is to select the entity which is more appropriate for a speciﬁc transaction,
i.e. that provides a speciﬁc IoT service. Of course this service might be
provided by more than one entity, thus the user has to select the most
appropriate according to some criteria.

190
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
• Transaction: When a service has been selected, the transaction takes
place and more information regarding the entity (that provides the
service) is being gathered by the system components, as a feedback.
• Rewarding and punishing entities: Trust management systems should
also include functionalities for rewarding the entities that are performing
according to the criteria and have high reputation. At the same time,
the system must punish malicious or untrustworthy entities that may
negatively affect system decisions or the systems’ overall reliability and
trustworthiness.
Based on the above and as described in [16], a trust model for the IoT
can be split in two main sub-models: (i) a trust evaluation model and
(ii) a reaction model. The Trust evaluation model is responsible for gathering
trust metrics and trust ratings for the system entities and evaluating them for
extracting their reputation, while the reaction model is responsible for reacting
to these reputation evaluations, either by rewarding or by punishing the
entities.
The trust evaluation model has to be lightweight, keeping a small state that
is updated regularly, so that it can also run on constrained devices. For the trust
evaluation model, as proposed in RERUM [16], the main idea is that there is
a set of observers that are providing trust ratings for a speciﬁc entity in mind
(be it software, hardware, user or object). These trust ratings are trust values
that relate to the conﬁdence that this observer has on this entity according
to some criteria. Trust ratings can also be provided by the administrator of
the system or by other users that have had past interactions with this entity.
These trust ratings are then fused into a centralized component (i.e. reputation
manager) that extracts the reputation of this entity. Then, when a user, a service
or another entity wants to interact with the entity under evaluation, it queries
this centralised component to get the reputation and decide according to its
own rules if it can trust this entity or not.
A reacting model can be considered as another set of rules that describe
the actions of the system when a reputation for an entity is evaluated. Any
reputation change may trigger reactions by the system [16]. For example, when
a reputation of a trusted entity is being decreased, an alert may be triggered so
that the system will search to ﬁnd what is the cause of this reputation decrease.
On the contrary, when a reputation of an untrusted entity is increased, another
alert may be triggered so that this entity will be closely monitored to identify
if it has become trusted or not. The reactions are based on speciﬁc rules that
are mainly being deﬁned by the system administrator. Various reactions can be

191
deﬁned, i.e. logging alerts, warning administrators, disabling or re-enabling
services, stopping/starting gathering data from devices, initiating networking
or system conﬁguration mechanisms, warning users, etc.
In the following subsections, we present details for the trust evaluation
model, as described in the RERUM [17] and Sociotal [18] projects. The focus
is on devices and services, which are of outmost importance for the IoT.
Although the end users are also very important when interacting with IoT
systems, the trust evaluation for users is not discussed within this chapter
since existing schemes for user reputation in the Internet can be applied
[17, 20, 21].
6.4 Trust for Devices
The trust model for IoT devices aims to improve the reliability and trust-
worthiness in IoT scenarios where disparate and unknown devices interact
each other and provide data to IoT applications. The device-based trust model
follows a multidimensional or multi-layered approach to calculate the overall
trustworthiness of an IoTdevice.The model describes the procedure employed
to quantify several trust dimensions (or trust metrics). Then, the dimension’s
values are aggregated to come up with a ﬁnal score of trust i.e. by means of
fuzzy logic or data fusion techniques such as the Dempster Shafer theory of
evidence to avoid outliers or malicious nodes [22].
The trust dimensions correspond to different properties that have to be
taken into account in the IoT paradigm. Contrary to past approaches that
considered only reputation between different devices and data reliability,
lately other parameters such as communication reliability, security aspects
and social relationships between the devices are being considered. In the end,
this approach leads to a more accurate and reliable value of trustworthiness
about a given IoT device, which can be exploited either for improving the
reliability of the provided services or for increasing the overall security of the
IoT system.
The trust model follows a hierarchical and a layered approach in which the
different dimensions are split in categories and subcategories, which in turn
are composed by measurable properties. This hierarchical approach enables
the trust model to be extensible, allowing users to consider and include new
properties to the model. Nonetheless, the trust quantiﬁcation procedure is
the same regardless of the amount of properties taken into account. In fact,
some of the trust properties explained below could be optional in case the

192
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
implementation of the IoT system is unable to measure these properties. Of
course in that case the resulting trustworthiness value of the device will be
sub-optimal, but it will give a good indication [23].
The trust dimensions can be measured in different layers within an IoT
network. Some of them can be measured on the devices themselves and the
values will be exchanged between the devices and fused in order to extract
the reputation of each of their neighbour devices. Other dimensions may be
calculated at cluster heads or gateways, which will do the fusion of the reports
of the devices and then they will feed back the results to the devices. This
approach may save enough computational resources on the devices in case
the trustworthiness evaluation is complex.
Finally, some dimensions may also be calculated at the backbone cloud
servers or the IoT middleware, where centralized trust management schemes
may be employed, which will allow the fusion of measurements from more
devices connected to different gateways to have a more accurate reputation
evaluation for the devices.
In IoT the evaluation of the trustworthiness of a device can be generally
based on multiple criteria that can be grouped into 5 categories: (i) com-
munication criteria, (ii) security criteria, (iii) data-based criteria, (iv) social
relationship criteria, and (v) reputation criteria.
6.4.1 Communication-based Trust
The communication based criteria correspond to the quality of the commu-
nication links between the devices. Although someone may think that the
communication link quality is not directly related with the trustworthiness
of the devices, this is not entirely true because the link quality may affect
signiﬁcantly the performance of the device’s transmissions. This will in turn
affect the Quality of Service provided by this device (in terms of throughput,
delay, jitter, etc.) and its availability.
Within RERUM, the communication based trust criteria are mainly used
for evaluating the networking related trustworthiness of the devices which is
then used to consider the trusted devices within network-related cooperative
mechanisms such as cooperative routing, spectrum or channel allocation,
network monitoring, etc. In this respect, the main criterion considered is the
link quality statistics based on a link quality metric. In RERUM, the chosen
metric is the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) metric which has been
proved in the literature that is quite accurate in evaluating the reliability of the
link between any two nodes.

6.4 Trust for Devices
193
The ETX is very widely used for routing mechanisms because apart from
providing good reliability results it is also quite simple and computationally
efﬁcient, so that it can be easily calculated even in the very constrained IoT
devices.
As described in [25], the ETX calculated for node i by node j is deﬁned as:
ETXi,j =
1
fi,j · ri,j
,
where fi,j is the metric for the forward delivery ratio, namely the probability
that a packet sent from node i is received by node j, and ri,j is the reverse
delivery ratio, namely the probability that the acknowledgement packet from
node j will be received by node i.
It is easily anticipated that the ETX is a metric of the retransmissions
that a device is performing in order to successfully transmit a packet to the
destination.
Basically, the ETX expresses the average number of transmissions that
are required for a successful delivery of a packet to its destination when there
are transmission failures due to degradation of link quality (e.g. interference,
collisions, etc.).
6.4.2 Security-based Trust
The security trust criteria are mainly related with the behaviour of a device
as this is anticipated by its neighbours. In the literature, these criteria are also
described as behavioural trust metrics.
These metrics correspond to speciﬁc types of attacks as described in [26]
and presented in Table 6.1.
By evaluating and fusing these metrics, the security-based trust of the
devices can be calculated, which will show how susceptible this device is in
these types of attacks, affecting it overall trustworthiness and the way the rest
of the neighbours behave towards this device.
These metrics can be calculated mainly at the device level or at the cluster
head/gateway level, when the devices are incapable (in terms of resources) to
do these calculations. In order to calculate these metrics at the device level,
the devices have to be able to go into promiscuous mode [16].
If one wants to measure some of the metrics of the table (i.e. data/control
packets forwarded, metric No. 1 in the table), every time a device sends a
packet to one of its neighbours (in a multihop network) it should enter into
promiscuous mode so that it monitors if the destination neighbour forwards the

correct packet, if it forwards a modiﬁed packet or if it drops the packet. Then,
it can change the respective trust rating for this neighbour device accordingly.
In RERUM’s view, it can be assumed that the metrics (1), (2), (3), (4), (5)
and (8) are the most important ones, while the others can be used in speciﬁc
cases.
The metrics can be used either “as is” or by assigning different weights
to each one for giving larger weight values to the most “important” metrics
according to the application what will use the trustworthiness value of the
device. One such example is given in [26]:
BRi,j =

ws × BCs
i,j, with
n

s=1
ws = 1.
In RERUM [27], we have used formulas for the metrics No. 1 and No. 2 in
the table above, namely for packet delivery and packet integrity. These are

6.4 Trust for Devices
195
assumed to be the most commonly used in this type of trust criteria because
they represent the most common attacks for malicious users in IoT networks.
All devices within an IoT network are assumed to be monitoring the
behaviour of their neighbours when they are interacting with them.
For these two metrics, the following statistics can be used: (i) Packet
Drop Rate (PDR), as the ratio of the number of dropped packets divided by
the total number of received packets and (ii) Packet Modiﬁcation Rate (PMR),
as the ratio of the number of modiﬁed packets divided by the total number of
forwarded packets.
However, these metrics correspond to the values observed by one device
for one of its neighbours. Assume that a receiver device ‘j’ receives a
packet, each neighbour ‘i’ overhears the forwarding behaviour of ‘j’ and
updates accordingly the values of PDRi,j and PMRi,j. Then, we can use a
combined metric called aggregate Misbehaviour Rate (MBR) for the device
‘j’as perceived by device i is calculated as:
MBRi,j = w × PDRi,j + (1 −w) × PMRi,j
where w∈[0,1] is a user-deﬁned weight controlling the balance between the
behavioural statistics.
6.4.3 Data-Reliability based Trust
One of the most important trust metrics for IoT devices is related to the
reliability of the data they produce. By using the term “data” we refer to
the measurements the IoT devices are producing from their onboard sensors,
i.e. environmental, location, energy, etc. These measurements are being used
by the services of the system and if they are unreliable they may severely
degrade the trustworthiness of the overall system. Consider for example a
weather station producing wrong values for the temperature and the rain level
in the centre of the city and the citizens are falsely informed and are not
properly dressed. Another example may be regarding the alerts for ﬁre or
hazardous gases. It is evident thus that the data reliability is very important
because it can even affect the safety of the users/citizens.
The data reliability based trust metric is also described in the literature as
“service-based metric” [16]. Its evaluation is done by comparing the measure-
mentswithknownmeasurementpatterns,pastmeasurementsormeasurements
of other devices at the same area, monitoring the same physical object and
the same property of the object. This means that we should only compare
temperature measurements from different sensors monitoring the same room

196
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
and not different rooms or measurements of temperature with humidity. The
goal is to identify inaccuracies in the measurements observed by the devices.
In this direction, a statistical analysis of the measurements’ time series can
be done (i.e. the deviation from the average value reported in X previous
timeslots) and/or compared to the measurements reported by another similar
device. For this type of calculation, there have been proposed many techniques
in the literature for i.e. outlier detection in WSNs, see the references in [28].
What is different in the IoT world, as described in RERUM, is that the
IoT devices may have various sensors of different types onboard and may be
providing multiple services.As a result, when the system needs to evaluate the
data-based trust metric, this evaluation must be done separately for each one of
these services and then it can be combined, if needed, to calculate the overall
data-based trustworthiness of the device. In most cases, the applications or
the functions that will use the data-based trust rating will only need the rating
for one service and the overall trust rating may not be of importance for them.
However, for self-monitoring purposes, the overall trust rating might also be
important.
Let’s assume that each device can provide ‘N’ services, then N data-
based trust ratings, one for each service it provides can be calculated. A
low trust rating for one service does not mean that other services provided
by different sensors will also be unreliable. However, combining the trust
ratings for services provided by a speciﬁc sensor can provide results about
the malfunctioning of that sensor or its driver being hacked. Furthermore, the
fusion of the trust ratings of all services can only give a hint if the node is
tampered with/hacked so that it reports intentionally false measurements.
So, we can have trust metrics as below:
OSTMi =
N

Sx=1
wSx × STM Sxi,
where OSTM is the overall service based trust metric and the STM is the trust
metric for each one of the provided services Sx.
6.4.4 Social Relationship based Trust
In IoT, social parameters can also be used for evaluating the trust rating of
IoT devices. These social parameters are based on the emerging Social IoT
(SioT) paradigm, which assumes that devices can establish social relationships
with each other. In such a case, devices are assumed to be grouped into trust

6.4 Trust for Devices
197
bubbles or communities based on their social relationships, i.e. if they belong
to the same owner, if their owners are friends, are working together, if they
are located at the same area, if they have the same manufacturer, etc. The
Community of the devices is formed when the devices that share common
interests are interacting and the more they interact the stronger becomes the
trust relationship between them [23].
An IoT trust model has to consider the social relationship between a device
‘i’ when assessing the trust of a device ‘j’. Different weights can be given
to the relationship between the devices considering the links among them.
The weights assigned by the trust model to the social relationships should be
conﬁgurable by the user in the interval [0..1] and should satisfy:
WBp > WBf > WBo > WC
Where Bp is the Personal Bubble, Bf is the Family Bubble, Bo is the Owner
Bubble and C is the Community Bubble. Apart from this, when the devices
do not belog in one of these bubbles, the trust model can calculate the degree
of Interest-In-Common or the Friends-In-Common. The Interest-In-Common
Ii
j can be calculated as the ratio between the interest that both devices share
over the total amount of interests of the evaluator device
Ii
j = interest(i) ∩interest(j)
interest(i)
.
Similarly, the Friends-In-Common F i
j can be calculated as the ratio between
the number of friends that both devices have in common, and the total amount
of friends of the evaluator device
F i
j = friends(i) ∩friends(j)
friends(i)
.
It should be noticed that to quantify the interests and friends in common the
devices should be able to exchange, in a common way, their list of interests
(e.g. services and capabilities) as well as the lists of friends.
6.4.5 Reputation based Trust
As mentioned before, an IoT trust model should consider recommendations
from multiple devices about a particular device j. Let Oi
j be the Opinion
score about device j given by device i. It is also reasonable to assume that
the opinions of different devices may have different impact on the opinion

198
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
score of other devices, that’s why there can be weights for each one of the
“recommender” devices. This weight can be calculated based on the past
behaviour of this device in the opinion scores or also on the trustworthiness of
the device [23]. Thus, the opinions are subject to a credibility process where
each reputation evidence coming from a device i is subject to credibility factor
Cri in the interval [0..1], where 1 represents the highest credibility. Therefore,
the Reputation property in our trust model is given by Ri
j = Oi
j ∗Cri.
Since the opinion scores are calculated by the trust ratings provided
by the devices for their neighbours, the results can be biased leading to
uncertainty. For this type of reputation evaluation, other techniques for trust
fusion can be used, i.e. the Dempster Shafer theory of evidence, which is a
powerful mathematical framework able to handle uncertainty of the complete
probabilistic model describing the system under consideration.
The calculation of the reputation metric can be done either at the device
level, at the gateways, or even at a centralized or cloud based IoT middleware
[16]. If calculated at the device level, each device should store the direct
evidences and recommendations provided by other devices to quantify trust
of each neighbour. However, this can be quite demanding in terms of computa-
tional and storage resources and might not be appropriate for constrained IoT
devices. Thus, either evidences about devices which they do not interact for
a long period of time should be discarded or the evaluation of the reputation
trust should be escalated to the cluster heads, gateways or the middleware.
6.5 Trust for IoT Services
The IoT Services provide streams of information towards the end users. Thus
when evaluating the reputation of a service, the goal is to provide enough
information so that a user can have an answer to the question if he can rely
on a speciﬁc service or if the service provides reliable measurements. As
mentioned in the beginning of Section 9.3, a user has to query the reputation
manager for getting the reputation value of that service. We can assume that
for privacy reasons only authorized users are allowed to query the reputation
manager for speciﬁc services.
IoT services can be either simple services provided by a single device or
composed services that combine data from many devices. Of course, behind
the provision of the service lies a business logic that also has some rules
for managing the data from the devices. The reputation of a service is directly
related with the reliability of the data of this service.As a result, for evaluating

6.5 Trust for IoT Services
199
the reputation of a service, the trust rating of its data stream has to be evaluated.
Thus, an observer has to be allocated to monitor this data stream. The observer
should basically extract statistics for the data stream, in order to be able
to identify changes in the pattern of the data stream, i.e. to identify when
there are jumps or values that are outside the “normal” limits of the data
stream [16].
For the statistics of the data stream, the ﬁrst calculation that has to be done
is the average value, that can be calculated as an overall average or as a moving
average on a sliding window (according to the criteria of the administrator and
the properties of the data stream). Here the challenge is to be able to calculate
the average without using too much storage, so that even constrained devices
willbeabletocalculateit.Then,theobserverhastocalculatealsothelimitsand
the thresholds of the data stream (in terms of minimum and maximum value)
so that an alert will be ﬁred if a value outside these thresholds is measured
[16]. For example, when measuring the temperature in a room, it might have
been noticed that in the past the minimum value was around 5 degrees and the
maximum around 35 degrees. If the temperature monitoring service provides
values of around 50 degrees, an alert has to be ﬁred for a possible ﬁre in the
apartment or for a possible tampering with the service’s data (i.e. a hacked
device or a n intermediate entity altering the measurements). In the latter case,
the reputation of the service has to be lowered.
Apart from the values outside the thresholds, sudden jumps in the data
stream might cause change in the reputation of the service [16]. For example,
in the previous scenario of a temperature monitoring service, if the current
temperature of the room is around 10 degrees and suddenly the service starts
providing values around 25 degrees this might ﬁre an alarm despite the fact that
the values are within the thresholds. Such a sudden jump has to be evaluated
because it might mean that the service might be providing false values and
its reputation has to be decreased. For this reason, the alarm might to be a
warning to the administrator of the system to check what is happening in that
room. Another type of an alert, may cause the cross-evaluation of the values
of the temperature service with the values of other services, i.e. of a smoke
detector service to see if there is indeed a ﬁre in that room, etc.
It can be easily understood from the latter scenario that in order to evaluate
the reputation of a service, the calculation of the statistics of its data stream
might not be enough. Thus, there needs to be a mechanism to allow the cross-
evaluation of the statistics of different data streams (assuming that some data
streams are known to be trustworthy).

200
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
For the usage of the statistics of the data streams, the deﬁnition of the
thresholds and the identiﬁcation of the jumps, speciﬁc rules have to be deﬁned
either by the administrator of the system or by the users that want to receive a
service [16]. Within RERUM, the expert system CLIPS [29] has been selected
for the implementation of the rules in a simple but powerful way.
6.6 Consent and Trust in Personal Data Sharing
The volume of data is doubling every two years, of which two thirds is
generated by individuals, in particular with adoption of new wearable devices
[30]. This growth has been driven by the increasing of both the number of
connected devices in our lives as well as their capabilities. This trend looks
set to continue with data trafﬁc from IoT devices rising from 2% share of
the total in 2013 to 17% in 2020. Only considering the Public Health sector,
sharing of personal data is estimated to generate 100Bn EUR value per year.
This derives from the creation of new services such as those providing holistic
approach to healthcare, where prevention and caring of long-term conditions
can be made more effective by combining information beyond those included
only in medical records, but including also any related life style information
(such as shopping and dietary habits, ﬁtness/exercise information etc).
In the current IoT service model, personal data are mostly collected by a
multiplicity of Service Providers, each one offering a dedicated service, most
of the time provided through a freemium model [31], whose main revenues
stream is generated by third party exploitation of generated data for target
advertisement.
This currently undermines individuals’ trust in sharing IoT personal
data, thus hindering its associated value. A recent Digital Catapult report on
Personal Data and Trust [32] highlighted that 60% of consumers are uncom-
fortable about sharing their data, with a further 14% feeling so uncomfortable
that they do not want to share their data at all. Individuals’reluctance to share
personal data becomes higher when commercial purpose is foreseen while
more conﬁdence is put in sharing data for research purposes. However, people
feel uncomfortable with their information being used for secondary purposes
if not enough trust is put in the organization originally collecting the data and
re-distributing them to third parties [33]. Preparedness of individuals to share
their data varies considerably by sector, with more than a third of individuals
trusting banks and the public sector, but less than 5% trusting mobile network
operators, utilities, retail and media companies. In general 80% of consumers

6.6 Consent and Trust in Personal Data Sharing
201
feel organisations hold their data solely for economic gain. Even for public
sector organisations, only 45% of consumers believe they hold data for their
beneﬁt.
There is a need to regain individuals’ trust by increasing transparency on
how data are collected, managed and shared. Control is the key and to support
this change in the current trend, the new General Data Protection Regulation
[34] (aka GDPR), recently approved and in force by early 2018, is putting the
end-user (aka the individual) at the center of this process, while promising
expensive sanctions for those businesses big and small failing to comply to
its principles (e.g., up to 100 Mio or 4% of their annual turnover ﬁnes for big
corporates and up to 100K or 2% of annual turnover for SMEs).
Figure 6.1 shows what are the elements required to develop a personal
data sharing ecosystem, where trust should be maintained by giving individual
control on how their personal data are collected and further used.
Attribute Providers collect personal data through the provisioning of a
service as part of their day-to-day operations (e.g., banks, utility suppliers,
IoT service providers, etc.). To avoid to lock such data in silo’ed systems,
and to allow further access, reuse and combination of them for creation of
new services by a growing ecosystem of SMEs, data need to be brokered
according to well-deﬁned rules (aka the Scheme), enforced by certiﬁed
Scheme Operators.
For ensuring compliance to GDRP, while increasing individuals’trust, the
envisioned Scheme should set, among others, the following principles:
Figure 6.1
Personal data sharing ecosystem.

202
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
• Transparency: Privacy Notices for data sharing should be easy to access
and to understand, explaining how data are processed, what are the
individuals’ rights and how they can be enforced;
• Consent: Valid consent must be explicit for data collected and the
purpose for the data collection should be stated. Data controllers must be
able to collect “consent” form end-users (opt-in) and consent might be
withdrawn;
• Erasure:Attribute Providers (e.g., the data controllers) are the entry point
for the erasure requests and need to inform third parties (e.g., the Relying
Parties).
If control means trust for individuals [35], to exercise this control, hence the
consent to sharing cross-domain personal data, there is the need for tools and
open standards. Consent Receipt [36] represents one of such tools.
The Consent Receipt inherently, by being a record of consent given at
the point of consent (e.g., when ﬁrst accessing a service), provides proof of
consent and delivers contact information to communicate about consent
directly to the end user. According to GDPR and in order to guarantee
individuals’ trust, consent should be: freely given (opt-in); informed, i.e., ‘no
legitimate interest’ in using collected data should be allowed; speciﬁc, i.e.,
bound to the purpose the data are collected for; unambiguous and transparent,
i.e., additional personal data cannot be vaguely collected while offering a
service; dynamic, i.e., it can change over time and be revoked at any time.
The Consent Receipt provides the evidence that the consent for personal
data sharing is properly collected and guarantee individual control over it,
thus maintaining trust in the created ecosystem.
Figure 6.2 provides a summary of a Minimum Viable Consent Receipt
standard’s elements, currently under development by the Kantara Initiative
through its Consent and Information Sharing Working Group and the support
of the Digital Catapult Personal Data Network (https://pdtn.org).
In particular:
• Header: The purpose of which is to set out administrative ﬁelds for the
consent transaction, including a unique Consent ID;
• PI (Personal Information) Controller Information:This section identiﬁes
the individual and company that is accountable for data protection and the
privacy policy (included in the receipt or linked to otherwise) to which
the consent is bound;
• Purpose Speciﬁcation: This section clearly speciﬁes the purpose(s)
for which Controller is collecting additional Personally Identiﬁable
Information [37];

6.6 Consent and Trust in Personal Data Sharing
203
Figure 6.2
Consent receipt structure.
• Personally Identiﬁable Information: This section speciﬁes the personal
information categories and related attribute collect by the PI Controller;
• Information Sharing: When applicable and stated in the Privacy Policy,
the purpose of this section is to provide the individual with information
about how their information is shared with third parties;
• Scope: This section speciﬁes the technical and policy scope within which
the collected data are used.
Like a paper receipt for any purchased good, it is clear how issuing end users
with Consent Receipts, adequately certiﬁed by a Scheme Operator, for each
digital service developed by a Service Provider using personal data collected
by Attribute Providers, gives them a trusted tool to clearly understand how
their data are used and to control how they are eventually shared.The same tool
allows also to easily revoking access to such data with possibility to backward
notify all the third parties accessing the same data, thus guaranteeing the right
for erasure.
To ensure use of such trust tool, some additional elements are requested
to create the Trust Framework encapsulated in the “Scheme” overarch-
ing the personal data sharing and operationalized by the certiﬁed Scheme
Operators. Figure 6.3 shows the elements of the so deﬁned Open Consent
Framework [38].

204
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
Figure 6.3
Open consent framework.
First of all, certiﬁed authorities perform a Service Assessment of Relying
Parties that develop services using personal data, in order to provide a data
protection impact assessment and to collect the information required to pre-ﬁll
the Consent Receipt ﬁelds, specifying what data and how they are collected,
used and shared according to stated privacy policies. The result of such
assessment is used to pre-conﬁgure a Consent Receipt Generator, the access to
which is provided to the given Relying Party as Service (Consent ReceiptAsA
Service, CRaaS). Unique Consent Receipt IDs, useful for auditing purposes,
are created by the Scheme Operator and assigned to each generated receipt.
Along with the Consent Receipt ID, the remaining Consent Receipt ﬁelds are
ﬁlled at run time.
A ﬁrst implementation and the related open APIs of a Consent Receipt
Generator can be found at: http://api.consentreceipt.org. For easiness of
management a JSON Web Token conversion of a Consent Receipt generated
by the Consent Receipt Generator is returned.
With this minimum set of services in place, third parties can develop
Auditing and Policing functionalities (e.g., similar to EuroPriSe [39] is doing
for website) aiming to verify that data are processed and used by Relying
Parties according to what stated in the given Consent Receipt. The result of
such auditing can enforce policing actions towards organization failing to
comply with the agreed principles and to build a Consent Receipt Registry
providing a transparent Kitemark [40] of compliant organizations. This will

6.6 Consent and Trust in Personal Data Sharing
205
allow end-users to monitor reputation of the organizations they give consent
to access to their own data.
On the other end, a set of end-users facing tools allow, among others,
individuals to manage consent, collect and group receipts, as well as visualize
and track shared personal data, through a User Consent Dashboard [41].
Currently more UX research is undergoing in order to understand, from an end-
user perspective, how to better visualize in the Consent Receipt and associated
Dashboard information about the type of data collected and how they are
used. The British Standard Institute (BSI) and Digital Catapult are currently
developing a new Publicly Available Speciﬁcation (PAS) [42] deﬁning a
number of icons providing such information, using trafﬁc light colour codes
similar to those used to classify food composition [43].
To support Consent revocation, achieved by handing over a given receipt
to the Relying Party providing the subscribed service, and to notify involved
third parties to remove collected data, an additional set of Consent Revoking
Notiﬁcation tools need to be developed.
By achieving end users trust through the above presented Open Consent

6.7 Using Trust in Authorization
The IoTAccess control system can implement a Trust Model in order to enable
secure and reliable interactions between granted and trustworthy entities.
This mechanism can be deployed on IoT scenarios where smart objects can
maintain social relationships, composing different kinds of groups of entities
called “bubbles” (e.g. Personal, Family, Ofﬁce or Community). According
to Figure 6.5, each bubble is made up of a set of smart objects, along with
an Authorization Manager, which is responsible for generating authorization
credentials for smart objects. Furthermore, each smart object have a Trust
Manager, which is in charge of assessing the trustworthiness of the other
involved entities [23].
The main entities involved in the trust-based access control process are
the following:
• Smart object. It is a device (e.g. a smartphone, printer, camera, sensor,
etc.) that can act both as a CoAP client and a CoAP server offering
services (e.g. temperature, location, etc.) in an IoT environment.
Figure 6.5
Sample scenario for Trust-based authorization in IoT.

6.7 Using Trust in Authorization
207
• Trust Manager. It is the component implementing the proposed trust
model. In the case of a smart object with tight resource constraints
(i.e., class 0 or class 1 device), the Trust Manager is deployed as separate
network element, such as a gateway. In the case of more powerful smart
objects (at least class 2 devices), the Trust Manager is a part of the
devices.
• Authorization Manager. It is responsible for generating and sending
authorization tokens to smart objects. Additionally, it is composed of
two subcomponents; the Policy Decision Point (PDP), which is in charge
of making authorization decisions based on a XACML engine, and the
Token Manager, which generates authorization credentials according to
the authorization decisions.
In a trust-aware access control system, an intra-bubble communication
happens when a smart object attempts to access another smart object that
is part of the same bubble. Figure 6.5 shows the interactions at high level
in the case of an inter-bubble communication between smart objects from
different bubbles. Under this scenario, the purpose of the Trust Manager (TM)
istwofold.Ontheonehand,itisusedbytherequestersmartobjecttoknowthe
most trustworthy target among a set of devices providing the same service. On
the other hand, it is employed by the target smart object in order to get the trust
value associated with the requester under a speciﬁc transaction. This value is
used, along with the authorization credential that is previously obtained from
the Authorization Manager, in order to make the access control decision.
The process carried out during the trust-based access control, depicted in
Figure 6.5, is summarized as follows. Firstly, the smart object A accesses its
TM in order to know the most trustworthy smart object providing a speciﬁc
resource in bubble B. The TM calculates the trust of the set of available
devices in bubble B (a prior discovery of devices is assumed). Then, in step
2 device A obtains an authorization token for accessing to devices in B. The
decision is made based on XACML policies evaluated by the policy engine.
This stage is optional and it is supposed to be done not so often, as tokens are
reusable.Afterwards,instep3,thesubjectsmartobjectAusestheauthorization
credential (authz token) for access to a service/resource being hosted on the
target smart object B. The target acts as PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) that
enforces the authorization rights deﬁned in the token, taking into account as
well actual context conditions. During this interaction the target device also
considers the trust value associated to the requester device (i.e. smart object
A). To this aim, it contacts its TM in bubble B, which quantiﬁes in real time
the trust based on previous evidences within A as well as actual conditions.

208
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
Then, in step 6, device B veriﬁes that the obtained trust value is greater than
a threshold value, which was speciﬁed as a condition in the token. If that
condition is fulﬁlled, the request is accepted and the service is provided to
the smart object A. Finally, in steps 7 and 8 (reward stage), the smart object
A sends to its TM evidences feedback about the reliability of the interaction,
in order to update the trust value associated to the smart object B, which is
useful for future interactions.
6.8 Using Trust in an Indoor Positioning Solution
Smart buildings are comprised of devices integrated into the Internet infras-
tructure with network and processing abilities, which make them vulnerable
to attacks and abuse. The associated services and resources can be accessed
through mobile devices anytime and anywhere by common users, which may
interact each other according to their levels of trust and reputation. In the smart
buildings context, location-aware mechanisms for trust evaluation, can allow
a user located at a certain room to share his data only with users located in
his same location. In this way, a speciﬁc level of trust can be automatically
established among people located in the same room, because all of them can
be seen as belonging to the same ecosystem [44].
The effectiveness of location-aware security mechanisms is closely related
to the accuracy of the location information and the deﬁnition of security zones,
that is, the area where security aspects like access control, trust, reputation,
etc. may be established. However, in the context of smart buildings, how
this location information is obtained is a challenging task since traditional
mechanisms such as GPS are not useful. The indoor localization mechanism
for smart buildings is able to provide accurate location data to be included in
security aspects of smart services. The proposed system is based on the use
of sensors which are integrated in common smartphones built-in magnetic
sensors to make security mechanisms totally independent on the type of
devices and available signals in buildings. The sensed magnetic ﬁeld is a
combination of the effects of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and that of surrounding
objects. A methodological approach is used to generate the buildings maps
containing the magnetic ﬁeld distribution used as map of ﬁngerprints. Then,
based on such maps, location estimations are calculated using a combination
of Radial Basis Functions Networks and Particles Filters [45].
TheAccess Control system can rely on the Indoor location enabler to make
authorization decisions accordingly. In this way, devices can ask this service
in order to get the distance where a requester user is placed when trying to

6.9 Using Trust in Routing
209
access to their services; consequently, certain services can be only provided
when users are placed inside the authorization zone of some smart objects.
Figure 6.6 below depicts the proposed scenario to perform location-aware
access control in indoor environments. The smartphone, acting as a subject,
requests to get access a resource being provided by the target smart device.
Before allowing it to access to his resource, the target device evaluates both
the capability token as well as the subject’s position, which must be located
inside target’s security zone. The context that determines the smart object B
position comes from the indoor localization enabler.
Firstly, the use case requires an ofﬂine stage where the smartphone of user
A contacts with the Authorization Manager in order to get an authorization
credential to get access to smart objects. Notice that this phase requires the
authentication process. Once the subject is successfully authenticated, the
Authorization Manager evaluates the policies and generates (if allowed) a
token with the set of privileges associated to the smart object. Then, the subject
device wants to make use of a resource hosted by target device, and it uses the
obtained token to present it against the target, which validates the token, see
it the quantiﬁed trust value is over a threshold, and checks subject’s position
against a localization service, since only those devices located nearby are
allowed to get access.
6.9 Using Trust in Routing
A different scenario for the application of trust management in IoT systems
is related to improving the security, the privacy and the performance of a
network of IoT devices. Assume that there is an IoT deployment with a
Figure 6.6
Location-aware access control for indoor environments.

210
Trusted IoT in the Complex Landscape of Governance, Security, Privacy
large number of IoT devices that are forming a multi-hop sensor network.
In such a network, the information from the leaf devices or any device has to
pass through a number of intermediate devices before it reaches the gateway
that will forward the measurements to the backbone middleware and the
applications. If there are intermediate devices that are either tampered with,
malicious or faulty, this may result to loss of information or to the provision
of faulty/tampered information. Moreover, malicious devices may be able to
get access to sensitive user information that is passed through them.
To avoid such scenarios, the evaluation of the trustworthiness of the
devices can be used in the routing mechanism of the network, so that malicious
or malfunctioning devices will be quickly identiﬁed and sensitive information
to be passed only through trustworthy devices. As described in [27], the
reputation evaluation of a network of IoT devices can be done very easily.
Assuming that the devices are able to monitor the transmissions of their
neighbours, the trust evaluation system can identify very quickly which
devices are providing erroneous information. The main idea is that before
the start of the trust evaluation all devices have a trust-rating of “unknown”,
which is then changed as the devices start to exchange data and observing the
behaviour of their neighbour devices. Generally, the rules that can be applied
are that the trust-belief for a device (i.e. how much we trust a device) should
increase slowly, in order to be sure after many interactions that the device is
trusted, but it should decrease faster, so that malicious or suspicious devices
should be avoided.
When the reputations of the devices have been calculated, then these have
to be included in the deﬁnition of the routing metric, to ensure that the nodes
will be able to identify the routes to the gateway by avoiding suspicious
or malicious devices. As shown in [46], including the device reputation in
the routing mechanism can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the IoT
network in terms of improved packet delivery ratio and throughput. This is
justiﬁed because by avoiding malicious nodes, the percentage of packet losses
or packet integrity fails will be minimized.
6.10 Conclusions
The IoT requires new adapted trust models able to overcome the drawbacks of
traditional complex models that have not been tailored for the pervasive nature
of such global ecosystem. The IoT trust management aims to improve the
reliability and trustworthiness in IoT scenarios where disparate and unknown
devices interact with each other. It is known that trust is closely inter-related

211
with security and privacy. However, the inter-relationship is not purely bi-
directional. If an entity is neither secure nor privacy preserving, then it should
not be trusted. On the contrary, if an entity is secure and privacy preserving,
this does not necessarily make it trustworthy for all users.
In this sense, this chapter has shown a trust model that follows a mul-
tidimensional approach to calculate the overall trustworthiness of an IoT
device. It deﬁnes different criteria for the evaluation of the trustworthiness,
such as communication, security, data-based criteria, social relationships, and
reputation.
Moreover, the trust model provides means for detecting malfunctioning
devices by checking if the provided values are inside a static range of values.
To this aim, it relies on a rule based approach and fuzzy logic techniques for
assessing the trustworthiness, which considers the plausibly, that is, whether
the devices are generating correct values.
In addition, this chapter has shown the way the IoT trust management
can leverage the access control by making authorization decisions based
on quantiﬁed trust values as well as indoor localization context. In this
sense, magnetic ﬁeld techniques have shown its feasibility for providing
accurate indoor localization positions with the aim of helping to make reliable
authorization decisions.

7.1 The Relevance of Hyperconnectivity
Technology changes the world in a fast pace. Information, communication,
internet and cloud computing technologies have shown and are showing this
already on a daily basis, and have connected people, organisations and data.
The Internet ofThings (IoT) will push this process further, by hyperconnecting
people, organisations and their data with billions of objects.
Where technology is global and evolving with lightning speed, regulation
is local. Policy, deployment and enforcement mechanisms and instruments
havenotalwaysshowntobeabletoadapt,reactandgovernnewdevelopments.
With the introduction and global use of the IoT the related challenges will
increase.
However, policy making and enforcing such policies, whether being
legislation, regulations or otherwise, has valid and very relevant and important
reasons and purposes, such as creating, inﬂuencing and setting a balanced,
predictable trustworthy, fair, reasonable, transparent and open yet where
necessary protective framework in order for the society and economy to
operate in a trusted and civilised way and be monitored and fostered.
As per technological change, globalisation, worldwide competition and
demographical challenges in most regions in the world, operating in a durable
hyperconnected economy and society and boosting innovation and productiv-
ity are not nice to haves anymore. These are a necessity to have, in order to
stay relevant as an economy and society but also to avoid social disruption.
In the Digital Single Market strategy the European Commission basically
recognises the importance of these elements within the digital economy.

IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
Within scope of the section on ‘Maximising the growth potential of the Digital
Economy’oftheDigitalSingleMarketstrategy,theEuropeanCommissionhas
proposed several initiatives to investigate, inﬂuence and in some cases propose
new or updated standardisation, self-regulation or other policy mechanisms,
which will offer new regulatory frameworks. It is part of any society, economy,
market or ecosystem, including the IoT ecosystem.
IoT implies a high volume of relationships between many hyperconnected
actors – whether human, organisations, algorithms or machines –, and those
relationships will need to be arranged and catered for.
These actors within the IoT ecosystem and related digital markets need
predictability and legal certainty on the numerous relationships as well as
related issues in order to enter the market as vendor or buyer, invest in or pro-
cure new products, services and embrace new business models, irrespective of
being a private or public organisation or community, or being a governmental
body, large corporation, SME or consumer.
In order to make IoT and related hyperconnected ecosystems work, create
space to innovate, modernise the society, build global connectivity, nurture
internet openness, create trust, jobs and skills in the digital economy and
society, and continue working on and safeguard an acceptable level of social
prosperity that is durable. The two now colliding worlds of digital technology
on the one hand and regulations and compliance on the other will need to be
connected and hyperconnected as well.
From an IoT ecosystem and hyperconnected point of view, this Chapter
will investigate, point out, explain and structure several of the main challenges,
considerations and perspectives in the domain where these worlds meet,
collide and will need to get used and adapt to each other in the best way
possible.
This Chapter does not exhaustively identify or describe any and all
challenges, considerations and perspectives in the domain, and does also
not intent to be limiting those challenges, considerations and perspectives
mentioned hereunder.
7.2 Unambiguous Deﬁnitions
It is fundamental and important to keep the deﬁnitions regarding and related
to IoT well deﬁned and unambiguous, in order to enable clear communication
between multiple stakeholders, to ensure effective recommendations, and
to come to a common understanding. Without such basis and common

7.2 Unambiguous Deﬁnitions
217
understanding, it is quite impossible to build ecosystems, frameworks, policies
and relationships that understand, interact and interoperate with each other in
the IoT domain.
As technology and business models develop and new technology and mod-
els are developed and adapted, it will also be important to ensure deﬁnitions
are technology neutral, business model neutral, principle based and consistent
with fundamental rights and the fast evolving IoT landscape.
Deﬁnition of The IoT by ITU and the IoT European Research Cluster
(IERC) is:
‘The IoT is a dynamic global network infrastructure with self-
conﬁguring capabilities based on standard and interoperable com-
munication protocols where physical and virtual “Things” have
identities, physical attributes and virtual personalities and use intel-
ligent interfaces and are seamlessly integrated into the information
network.’1
The‘Thing’intheIoTcanbeanything,suchasforinstance(withoutlimitation)
devices, objects, algorithms, people, animals, plants or other Things (here-
inafter: ‘Things’). What makes these Things so special is their connectivity
via the internet and the ability to act in an orchestrated way, such as Machine to
Machine (M2M), Human to Machine (H2M) and Machine to Human (M2H).
The combinations are quite indeﬁnite. Taking into consideration that each
combination implies as least two ‘Things’ interacting with each other, there
are a lot of legal relationships to address and arrange for.
As the markets and European Commission has currently chosen to use
IoT to deﬁne this domain, it is good to mention that when one reads or hears
about Internet of Everything, Internet of Customers, Internet of Everyone,
Internet of Humanity or similar terms, one in essence means the same as the
deﬁnition of IoT set forth above. However, there is an ongoing debate on
whether humans are ‘Things’. For the purposes of this book in general and
this chapter in speciﬁc, it is understood that a human is not a thing but for
purposes of setting the scene on legal and other relationships, and in order to
easily work with the deﬁnition IoT it is within that deﬁnition.
In this document, the following terms used shall have the meaning
as set forth in the European Commission Cloud Service Level Agreement
1ITU-T Y.2060, ‘Overview of IoT,’ June 2012. White paper, ‘Smart networked machines
and IoT,’ Association Instituts Carnot, January 2011.

Standardisation Guidelines2, ISO/IEC 17788, which guidelines have been
initiated, discussed, set and endorsed by the European Commission and
currently provide for the most up to date and generally accepted deﬁni-
tions that are to most extent quite relevant and useful in the IoT domain
as well.
7.3 Converging Markets
The technologies that make IoT possible are converging existing markets
and creating new markets, both physical and virtual markets, private and
public markets and both vertical and horizontal markets. From the converg-
ing technical markets perspective, smart systems integration, cyber-physical
systems, smart networks, data analytics, cloud computing, robotics and
artiﬁcial intelligence bring together different generic technologies with nano-
electronics, wireless networks, low-power computing, adaptive and cognitive
systems.3
Basically, these can be divided in ﬁve main groups:
1. Things
2. Infrastructure
3. Data
4. Services
5. Connectivity and Interoperability
7.3.1 Things
The Things in the IoT are for instance (without limitation) devices, objects,
algorithms, people, animals, plants or other Things and are provided
with unique identiﬁers (or sometimes community identiﬁers) and the abil-
ity to transfer data over an infrastructure or network without requiring

7.3 Converging Markets
219
human-to-human or human-to-machine interaction.TheseThings are all about
collecting, deriving, using, storing and sharing data via the infrastructure.
7.3.2 Infrastructure
The infrastructure regards transmitting, collecting, storing and/or sharing the
data within the ecosystem. It is a collection of hardware, software and other
related products and resources that enables the provision of IoT and their
services.
7.3.3 Data
The key aspect that keeps IoT moving and alive is data. Data of any form,
nature or structure, that can be created, uploaded, inserted in, collected or
derived from or within the IoT, including without limitation proprietary and
non-proprietary data, conﬁdential and non-conﬁdential data, non-personal and
personal data, as well as all other human readable or machine readable data.
Data Life Cycle: the life cycle of processing data commonly includes
seven (7) phases:
1. Obtain/collect
2. Create/derive
3. Use
4. Store
5. Share/disclose
6. Archive
7. Destroy/Delete
This data life cycle is also used for personal data, which is then called the
personal data life cycle.
It should be noted that data does not only arise out of the ﬁrst two phases,
but data is created and processed in each and any phase. For example, when
deleting data, other data describing the act of deletion may arise.
7.3.4 Services
One or more capabilities offered invoked using a deﬁned interface. There is a
seemingly endless amount of services offered within IoTin a countless amount
of categories, as well as virtual as physical.
The services are extended into ﬁelds such as education, intelligent build-
ings, supply chain, health care, everyday life, disaster management, safety and
transport to provide people with better services.

220
IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
7.3.5 Connectivity and Interoperability
As above-mentioned IoT can be built by using any number of technologies
and a particular technology stack should not be assumed. Essential hallmarks
of IoT are connectivity and interoperability for which technology neutrality
is required.
For example, many products and services are connected with REST
interfaces or APIs to exchange data and interoperate with other products,
services and Things.
7.4 Relationships and Markets
As the domain of IoT is vast, one needs to identify in which market it is
operating and which relationship between which Things it would want to
make possible and arrange for. This, as the characteristics of each market
and each relationship may have legal consequences and may need speciﬁc
frameworks and assurances.
The combinations of relationships are endless, as there are quite a few
Things, and each combination is possible. For instance business to business,
business to consumer, consumer to consumer, government to resident, resident
to government, commuters to parking services, and so on.
Whether such relationships make sense, depends on the circumstances and
purposes of the relationship and within what market. A whole new range of
relationships will arise and on top of that can have multiple purposes.

Hyperconnected, vertical and horizontal value chain.

7.5 What Are the Main Challenges
221
For example the development of smart cities and communities is a
vertical that has many verticals and cross-verticals combined, for instance
without limitation government to business, government to visitors, residents
to government, and commuters to business.
As another example, in the business to consumer market one already sees
IoT in operation, for example wearables, smart meters, connected cars, smart
mirrorsandsmartfridges.Theend-userofIoTinthismarketisaconsumerwho
uses the IoTin its daily life. It is well-known that a consumer has speciﬁc rights
to protect its interest, including without limitation personal data protection and
product liability.
7.5 What Are the Main Challenges
The Internet, cloud computing, data analytics and other advances in IoT have
spawned a global digital economy and the continuing evolution of connected
Things has added a new and growing dynamic. While IoT is increasing, it is
still in its nascent stages and the related technologies, business models and
polices will undoubtedly evolve over a number of years.
There are a number of challenges to facilitate sustainable growth of
IoT by adding clarity to the challenges between the converging markets
and stakeholders. Several of these main challenges are set below. Again,
please note that these are non-exhaustive, and some will be adequately
addressed or solved in the near future, where new challenges will surely
arise with the emergence of improved or new technologies and combinations
thereof.
7.5.1 Common Understanding
It sounds so logical and obvious: we need a common understanding of matters,
challenges and solutions. But in fact and real life, it is quite a challenge and
in this chapter identiﬁed as one of the main challenges.
Common understanding is a result from having found common ground, or
a result from having established certain ground as deemed to be the common
ground for the matter at hand. When addressing the matters at hand regarding
and related to IoT, the same applies. Common ground starts with the basics:
clear and unambiguous deﬁnitions. Some IoT deﬁnitions have been addressed
a few paragraphs above. Once the deﬁnitions are clear, the next steps are
principles and (legal) frameworks that stakeholders recognize and are able to
identify themselves with.

222
IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
Without such deﬁnitions, principles and frameworks as a basis for common
understanding, it will be impossible to build ecosystems, frameworks, policies
and relations that understand, interact and interoperate with each other.
The recommendation here is that in case one ﬁnds out that a dialogue,
discussion, debate or negotiations seem difﬁcult to be resolved, it may be
good to take a step back and return to the common understanding, before
re-entering into such discussions to seek common ground on the pending
matters.
7.5.2 Trust
Trust is always one of the challenges with new technologies and change.
Regarding IoT, customers and users thereof may need time to adapt, learn
that the opportunities beneﬁts are, and how to mitigate or cope with the risks.
Depending on the speciﬁc IoT, vertical it is used in, deployment thereof and
impact it may have for the customer and users, trust will in some cases be
obtained quicker than in other cases.
Integral parts of trust is security, data management, data protection and the
way vendors, providers as well as co-users and the related community will act
and react on a case to case basis. Another part of building trust is taking care
of customers and users with insufﬁcient knowledge. For instance, insufﬁcient
knowledge has been established by EuroStat to be the number one reason for
businesses not to procure paid cloud services, and the IoT industry should try
to avoid that such same barrier arises in the upcoming IoT market.4
7.5.3 Security
The technical architecture of the IoT has an impact on security and privacy of
the involved stakeholders and data subjects. For example Denial-of-service
attacks could be a major threat when it comes to the IoT ecosystem.5
Furthermore the security of both the relevant stakeholders in multiple
horizontals and verticals is for sure a main challenge as well. The value chains
are quite complex in IoT as per its hyperconnectivity and interoperability,
which by nature results in customers and users not understanding the possible
risks and impact thereof. Even though security is a horizontal itself, it is
expressly mentioned as being relevant for other horizontals as well, as IoT
4Eurostat News Release 9 December 2014.
5Denial-of-service-attacks typically involve the overﬂow of a network device with more
requests than it can process, leading to an overload that renders the service unable to answer
legitimate requests.

7.5 What Are the Main Challenges
223
verticals will generally be stacked with several layers, including without
limitation infrastructure, networks, products, devices, software, data and
services. The value chains of IoT are non-linear towards customers and
users; they are multi-angle, cross-vertical, and multi-horizontal. For example,
per layer in a vertical IoT ecosystem at least two security horizontal layers
may be necessary; one upon entry of data in such layer, and one upon exit
thereof.
A high degree of reliability is needed, since business processes are
concerned. However there are a lot of similarities when it comes to cloud
computing security standards which have already been developed and tested.
Specifying measurable security level objectives in IoT is useful to improve
both assurance and transparency. At the same time, it allows for establishing
common semantics in order to manage cloud security from two perspectives,
namely (i) the security level being offered by a stakeholder and, (ii) the security
level requested by a IoT user.6
The approach used in this section consists of analysing security controls
from well-known frameworks7 into one or more security objectives, when
appropriate. These objectives can be either quantitative or qualitative. This
section focuses on the deﬁnition of possible security objectives. Eight
categories are provided, each with one or more objectives.
The categories represent some important security requirements. However,
it should be noted that the list of objectives is not meant to be considered as
exhaustive and that the objectives proposed are not meant to be considered
as applicable in all individual cases. The applicability of particular objectives
depends on the type of products and services offered (in terms of both of
functionality and model) and pricing of it (free, paid, premium). It is important
to understand that some of the objectives are interdependent: objectives
relevant to security may also have relevance in the areas of data management
and personal data protection for instance.
• Reliability: reliability is the property of a IoT system to perform its
function correctly and without failure, typically over some period of
time. The system has to avoid single points of failure and should adjust
itself to node failures.
6Reference is made to Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of the Cloud Service Level Agreement
Standardization Guidelines regarding Security Service Level objectives overview. Further-
more, as an example for the security challenges reference is made to the report ‘New security
guidance for early adopters of the IoT’ of the Cloud Security Alliance which includes an IoT
Security Life Cycle.
7Relevant security frameworks include in particular ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002.

224
IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
• Authentication andAuthorization: authentication is the veriﬁcation of the
claimed identity of a Thing.Authorization is the process of verifying that
a Thing has permission to access and use a particular data or resource
based on the (predeﬁned) ecosystem it wishes to offer to the IoT user. As
a principle, retrieved identity and data of a thing must be authenticated.
• Cryptography: cryptography is a discipline which embodies principles,
means and methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its
information content, prevent its undetected modiﬁcation and/or prevent
its unauthorized use, also known by the term encryption. However
stakeholders must be able to implement access control on the data
provided in order to cooperate within the IoT ecosystem.
• Security incident management and reporting: an information security
incident is a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information
security events that have a signiﬁcant probability of compromising
operations and threatening information security. Information security
incident management are the processes for detecting, reporting, assess-
ing, responding to, dealing with, and learning from information security
incidents.
• Logging and Monitoring: logging is the recording of data related to the
operation and use of a IoT system. Monitoring means determining the
status of one or more parameters of a IoTsystem. Logging and monitoring
are ordinarily the responsibility of the relevant stakeholder’s.
• Vulnerability Management: a vulnerability is a weakness in an IoT
system, security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that
could be exploited or triggered by a threat. Management of vulnerabilities
means that information about technical vulnerabilities of information
systemsbeingusedshouldbeobtainedinatimelymanner,theexposureto
such vulnerabilities evaluated and appropriate measures taken to address
the associated risk.
• Governance: governance is a framework by which IoT will be directed,
controlled and governed.
7.5.4 Personal Data Protection
Data used to be quite static, and used to reside in one place. Digital data that
is connected to internet and cloud, and that is hyperconnected through IoT
ecosystems, travels. This may be the key catalyst of internet, cloud computing,
IoT and data analytics technologies being in some kind of way used and
embraced by each and any organisation in the worlds. The fact that data travels

7.5 What Are the Main Challenges
225
is not new, but have come on the agenda in the past years of both the demand
side as the vendor side, as well on the agenda of policy makers. As data
subjects, data controllers, companies, organisations and countries feel they
are losing control over their respective data, and do not always understand
or know how the data is processed, it is only natural that some of those are
reacting to try to regain control, whether it is personal data, sensitive data or
otherwise.
New regulations and directives related to personal data protection, such
as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and security breach
notiﬁcations, such as the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS
Directive) add to those concerns, but may also be part of the keys and
mechanisms to resolve these concerns, if implemented in a transparent and
understandable way for such data subjects, customers and users.
To understand (personal) data protection it is recommended to go back to
the basics, which means that data is not a four letter word. The difference
between the deﬁnitions of data and personal data should be clear and a
common understanding. Reference is made to paragraph 7.3.3 for the deﬁ-
nition of data where data is explained and what kind of data there are in the
IoT ecosystem.
Personaldatameansanyinformationrelatingtoanidentiﬁedoridentiﬁable
natural person (‘data subject’); an identiﬁable person is one who can be
identiﬁed, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identiﬁcation
numberortooneormorefactorsspeciﬁctohisphysical,physiological,mental,
economic, cultural or social identity.8 For the protection of personal data
the employment of technical, organisational and legal measures in order to
achieve the goals of data security (conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability),
transparency, intervenability and portability, as well as compliance with the
relevant legal framework is required.
The basis for personal data should be data minimization, where stakehold-
ers are responsible for ensuring that personal data is erased (by the provider
and any subcontractors) from wherever they are stored as soon as they are no
longer necessary for the speciﬁc purposes.
Based on the (new) regulations and directives related to personal data, the
principle of purpose speciﬁcation and limitation requires that personal data
must be collected for speciﬁed, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further
processed in a way incompatible with those purposes. Therefore, the purposes
8Chapter 2 and Chapter 6 of the Cloud Service LevelAgreement Standardization Guidelines
regarding personal data protection.

226
IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
of the processing must be determined, prior to the collection of personal data,
by the data controller, who must also inform the data subject thereof. When
the data controller decides to process data in IoT, it must be ensured that
personal data is not (illegally) processed for further purposes by the relevant
stakeholder, or one of the subcontractors.
Only if the data controller informs the data subject (the IoT user) about
all relevant issues and being transparent which data will be collected, then
the data controller is allowed and to process any (personal) data. The reason
therefore is that the data subject is capable of fulﬁlling its obligation to
assess the lawfulness of the processing of personal data. Moreover, the data
controller shall make available the information that enables the customer to
provide the data subjects with an adequate notice about the processing of their
personal data, as required by law. Furthermore, the (new) regulations and
directives related to personal data gives the data subject the right of access,
rectiﬁcation, erasure, blocking and objection.
One of the (new) requirements for the data controller as set forth in the
GDPR are codes of conduct, standards and certiﬁcation mechanisms. Such
codes of conducts, standards and certiﬁcation mechanisms for the stakeholders
gives more and clear guidelines how the IoT user is protected. The data
controller, must accept responsibility for abiding by the applicable data
protection legislation.
In order to maintain the above (personal) data protection approach within
IoT, the key is to adhere privacy-by-design in advance. In accordance with
the laws and regulations regarding data protection and the challenge thereof
within IoT, the main principles for privacy-by-design are the following:
• No personal data by default principle: avoid personal data collection or
creation by default, except where, when and to the extent required.
• ‘As-If’ principle: design and engineer IoT ecosystems as-if these will
process personal data, now or in a later phase.
• De-Identiﬁcation by default principle: de-identify, sanitise or delete
personal data as soon as there is valid legal basis anymore.9
• Data minimalisation by default: only process data where, when and to
the extent required, and delete or de-identity other data.
• Encryption by default principle: encrypt personal data by default, and
include digital rights and digital rights management thereto.

Guidelines for Media Sanitization’.

7.5 What Are the Main Challenges
227
7.5.5 Digital Right Management
As companies transition to IoT, the traditional methods of securing
and managing data is challenged by IoT-based connections. Elasticity,
multi-tenancy, new physical and logical infrastructures, and abstracted con-
trols require new data security strategies. Managing data and information
in the area of IoT can affect all organisations, users and Things. It begins
with managing internal data and service migrations and extends to securing
information in diffuse, cross-organisation applications and services.
The data management objectives cope with important quantitative and
qualitative indicators related with data life cycle management, and can be
considered as complementary to existing and applicable security and data
protection certiﬁcations offered by the IoT stakeholders.
The presented data management objectives are subdivided in four (4)
different top-level categories covering all aspects of the identiﬁed data life-
cycle. Each category is subdivided in one or more objectives that are applicable
to that speciﬁc category. Not all objectives may be relevant for each service,
in particular depending on the type of Things and stakeholders as M2M, M2H
or H2M.
7.5.6 Data Ownership and Data Access
Who owns the data? Why am I not able to retrieve my data? From the customer
and users perspective, the existing awareness, expertise and transparency of
both such customers, users as well as vendor level as well as policy makers
and authority level is generally not sufﬁcient to provide actors in the data
value chain with trust, predictability and legal certainty each needs to be able
to assess, make informed decision and have reasonable access and use of
IoT and related services. The same goes for the existing legal frameworks
and current contractual practices, although this obviously differs per product,
deployment model and service model as well per vendor and the (envisioned or
actual) use of the customer and users thereof. Contractual practices, including
the arrangements in or related to IoT also create obstacles to data use, access,
and in quite a few places create data lock-in effects as well.
One of the challenges with data ownership is that the concept of ‘owning’
digital data in the traditional sense of the word ownership in most cases in an
oxymoron and leads to discussion and conﬂicts. Data ownership is generally
not addressed in the IoT domain, because data ownership is a difﬁcult domain,
also as it is not deﬁned. Vendors may have a totally other opinion or perception
about data ownership than its customers and users, whether being SMEs or

228
IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
not, and the laws and regulations that have deemed to be governing ownership
are either outdated or are quite difﬁcult to apply, interpret, use and enforce in
the digital world.
It becomes even more problematic when some vendors have a traditional
mind-set that owning assets, including data, is a goal in itself. From another
perspective, ownership of digital data in general is basically not possible.
The current framework of copyright regulations is not particularly designed
for digital assets including data, while the redesign thereof in the early 90s
regarding software (Directive 91/250/EEC) has not proved to be a transparent
framework that resolves discussions and disputes on ownership as well. The
Database Directive (96/9/EC) from 1996 also has lost its effectiveness, as
a major requirement for protection thereunder is having done a substantial
investment to build the relevant database, where such databases nowadays
can be built and used for a fraction of the cost. The threshold to be eligible for
protectionthereunderisnotmetanymore,andlowingthethresholdwouldeven
increaseandnotresolvethediscussionondataownershipeither.Theupcoming
Trade Secret Directive (COM/2013/0813) that is proposed, may resolve a
minor part of the data ownership discussion, but in such case the protected
data thereunder needs to remain secret and not generally known or readily
accessible to third parties. In hyperconnected ecosystems where data travels
and data can change from legal characteristics and purpose of travelling and
being processed at any time, this will be quite challenging. Owning data is just
very difﬁcult, as one would like, or need to, share such data, have it processed
and transferred. On the other hand, domain names and related domain name
rights have been designed by law not to use the concept of ownership; it
uses the concept of holdership of a domain name, which has proven to work
quite well. Based on research done and ongoing research by Arthur’s Legal,
introducing and using the term ‘data control’ is the preferred way to move
forward in the IoT and related digital and hyperconnected domains. This also
to reﬂect on the challenges set above and to address the confusion and distrust
that the term ‘data ownership’ leads to. Data control better reﬂects the rights
a person or organisation may have, whether personal data or non-personal
data, and the rights can grant others. It also reﬂects that digital data can and in
most cases will be shared and processed. Data control will be one of the most
relevant and essential components to boost trusted hyperconnectivity and the
digital economy and society, as it is all about data.
The European Commission has data ownership and data-access on its
agenda, and has started the dialogue about how to be able to address this
domain of use rights and digital rights management. As Commissioner
Oettinger put it on these topics: ‘We need a single rule book for the Internet

7.5 What Are the Main Challenges
229
of Things in Europe. Capable to properly address new challenges raised
by the technology. This includes data protection, safety and liability rules,
including the emerging issues of data ownership, rules on access and re-use
of non-personal data in an industrial context, just to mention a few.’10
7.5.7 Free Flow of Data
On the Free ﬂow of data, it can be established that restrictions on the free
movement of data within the European Union and unjustiﬁed restrictions
on the location of data for storage or processing purposes are generally not
addressed in generic IoT products and services. This is understood as most
restrictions are only applicable to certain industries, markets or use. It is
however a main challenge as hyperconnected ecosystems are borderless and
the data therein should be able to ﬂow freely and unrestricted, at least within
the European Union.
Quite a few member states have implemented sector-speciﬁc rules and
regulations that differ per member state, thus hampering the digital single
market and European manufacturers, services providers and other vendors to
beneﬁt from being able to market its respective products, services and data to
other member states.

IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
7.5.8 Accountability and Liability
As per the convergence of technologies, markets and stakeholders, and as
these technologies, its manufacturers and vendors are diverse, the question
who is accountable and liable for what will be even more difﬁcult to answer
and proof than in the physical society.
For example, a manufacturer of certain objects has to accept and address
its respective and proportionate responsibility in the IoT ecosystem its objects
are deployed. IoT will bring more responsibility for each stakeholder in the
market, and each of such stakeholders will have to think and arrange for those
effects in a transparent, diligent and ethical manner.
Another example is a security breach in an IoT ecosystem as per insecure
coding of software somewhere in the multi-angled value chain. As long as
related software companies cannot be held accountable, a solid and stable
digital economy and society will be difﬁcult to create.
Merely contractually re-allocating risks and damages to the customer and
its users will not contribute to the creation of the Digital Single Market in
general, and uptake the IoT ecosystems in particular.
In the ﬁeld of data protection, accountability often takes a broad meaning
and describes the ability of parties to demonstrate that they took appropriate
steps to ensure that data protection principles have been implemented.
In this context, accountability is particularly important in order to inves-
tigate personal data breaches; to this end, the relevant stakeholders should
provide reliable monitoring and logging mechanisms.
Moreover, the relevant stakeholders should provide documentary evidence
of appropriate and effective measures that are designed to deliver the outcomes
of the data protection principles (e.g. procedures designed to ensure the
identiﬁcation of all data processing operations, to respond to access requests,
designation of data protection ofﬁcers, etc.). In addition, IoT users that are
deemed to be data controllers under the GDPR should ensure that they
are prepared to demonstrate the setting up of the necessary measures to
the competent supervisory authority upon request.
7.5.9 Too Much Data?
The billions of sensors and other objects and Things will generate so much
data, most of which is expected to be unstructured and not necessarily useful
yet making identifying relevant data more difﬁcult. Commonly available
data analytics technologies cannot yet cope with the amount thereof in a
comprehensive, useful way. As data analytics is one of the pillars to make

7.6 Multi-Angle Stakeholders IoT Ecosystem
231
IoT interesting, feasible and worthwhile, this can be seen as one of the main
technological challenges. Data architecture will therefore be quite important
to address. This, for instance also to comply to regulations and standardisation
including without limitation regarding personal data protection, security
breach notiﬁcation and the like.
7.5.10 Regulation and Standardisation
As argued in the paragraph 7.1, technology is global and regulation is local,
and new technology goes to market much quicker than regulations.
Policy makers are investigating and deploying other policy mechanisms
such as industry guidelines, best practices, codes of conducts, international
standardisation, community self-regulatory initiatives and the like, to ﬁnd
the right hybrid combination to be able to adapt, react and govern such
technological and related developments.
Getting the right mix of policies in the market, in time yet in a durable and
facilitating way, is quite a challenge nowadays.
7.6 Multi-Angle Stakeholders IoT Ecosystem
IoTcan be built using any number of technologies, used by different stakehold-
ers and for all kind of markets, whereby all kind of goals should be formalized
and covered by ethics, accountability, standardisation, legislation agreements
and insurance. Essential to reach this goal of IoT is that these are based on
technology neutral wording as a necessary foundation.
7.6.1 Technology and People
The most important elements of the multi-angle stakeholders IoT ecosystem
are the technology and the use thereof by the people. The technology of IoT
should be neutral and monitored from time to time to be up to date and based on
the state-of-the-art technology. Monitoring of the technology will be based on
the principles of security, personal data, digital right management, usability,
portability and accountability. If technology and for instance IoT will be a
success the people have to accept such new connected technology. People
play one of the key roles in the Ecosystem especially when it comes to imple-
mentation, acceptance and trust of IoT. The human factor is a big challenge of
IoT. Both technology and people have inﬂuence on the other stakeholders of
IoT as ethics, accountability, regulation, standardization, legislation and risk
allocation, which will be further discussed in the paragraphs below.

7.6.2 Ethics and Accountability
In every converging market, each stakeholder has to deal with ethic and
accountability regarding to IoT. For example, a manufacturer of certainThings
has to address the challenges of ethic with the connected Things, and whereby
such manufacturer has to accept its responsibility for all subjects of IoT. In
case of safety of a product, it is not possible to cover all product liabilities,
but IoT will bring more responsibility for each stakeholder in the market, and
have to think and discuss those effects in a transparent manner prior to the
other goals of IoT.
7.6.3 Regulation and Standardisation
The internet is a global communication channel and it is built on standards
that are respected worldwide, which is also the basis of IoT. However, the
government and compliancy of Things is covered by the current legislations,
which will not ﬁt completely for purposes of IoT. There are regional, national
and local laws have to govern the use of Things and all other aspects of

7.7 Conclusion and Recommendations
233
IoT for all kind of converging markets, stakeholders and markets. The goal
is that legislation should ﬁt for IoT based on technology neutral legislation,
because everyone beneﬁts from globally common understanding vocabulary
and legislation.
Standards and guidelines for IoT should specify the concepts and def-
initions necessary for the converging markets, stakeholders and markets to
describe the Things, infrastructure, data and services life cycles. There are
already standards and guidelines used and produced by organisations such
as ENISA, NIST or ISO/IEC. For example, in the ﬁeld of security, relevant
work is using the approach to analyse and reﬁne an individual control into
one or more security objectives, which are then associated with metrics and
measurements that can be either quantitative or qualitative. Before introducing
a particular concept into a standard or guideline for IoT, one should seek
proof to ensure the concept is viable from both technical and business
perspectives. With standardization of guidelines in the relevant markets of
IoT, it will create world-wide applicability, technology and business model
neutral, unambiguous deﬁnitions and create conformance through a global,
common understanding.
7.6.4 Contractual Relationships
The agreement between the stakeholders can refer to the clearly deﬁned
information in the legislation, standards and guidelines, but the agreement
itselfmustmeetlocallegalrequirementsandthosemustbelefttothediscretion
of qualiﬁed attorneys.
7.6.5 Risk Allocation
All the other risks, liabilities and other elements which could not be deﬁned
and arranged by legislation, standardisation and agreement should in a best
case scenario be covered by insurances. If insurance of IoT is possible than it
realizes that IoT is a mature market and the IoT ecosystem is complete.
7.7 Conclusion and Recommendations
New technologies lead to change. Change is a catalyst that can be feared, but
can also be embraced and used to optimise the current status quo of society and
economy, and sometimes even leapfrog technologies that have already been
improved. Especially the hyperconnected aspect of IoT technologies will have

234
IoT Societal Impact – Legal Considerations and Perspectives
quite some impact on the society and economy, and may raise certain ethical
or legal discussions on new and existing topics.
As the IoT technologies, developments, combinations and deployments of
IoT verticals and horizontals continue to evolve, the opportunities and chal-
lenges will evolve as well, including the legal and compliance consequences,
challenges and opportunities, including privacy, security and other compliance
by design and related automation thereof. Addressing and resolving these
challenges are one the most important value creating and success factors of
IoT. On privacy-by-design, the Article 29 Working Party worded it as follows
in the Opinion 8/2014: ‘Organisations which place privacy and data protection
at the forefront of product development will be well placed to ensure that
their goods and services respect the principles of privacy-by-design and are
equipped with the privacy friendly defaults expected by EU citizens’.
As any relatively new market, also the IoTsupply side and IoTdemand side
will need to ﬁnd, understand an trust each other the coming period, and for that
a principle-based ecosystem of IoTpolicy frameworks may facilitate of uptake
of that market. As its hyperconnected, agile and hybrid nature, such policy
framework ecosystem will need to be hyperconnected, agile and hybrid as
well in order to have the positive impact it seeks. Principle-based mechanisms
with a solid common ground of globally recognised deﬁnitions and principles
will facilitate such agile framework ecosystem. Each policy framework will
need to be hybrid, with all the tools and mechanisms available and newly
developed, including for instance self-regulation, community frameworks,
standardisation, whererelevantcurrentregulationandwherenecessaryregula-
tion, preferably Pan-European because of the borderless nature of technology.
As per the extreme variety of actors, objects, markets, capabilities, Things and
relationships, one single IoT framework seems difﬁcult, hence the conclusion
that an interoperable and durable ecosystem of IoT framework may be the way
to facilitate and support the market and all related stakeholders in an efﬁcient
way. Such ecosystem will need to be based on open and transparent dialogues
with a large variety of groups and stakeholders from a 3D multi-angle, both
internally at the European Commission, as well as externally in the European
Union and beyond.
With such hyperconnected multi-disciplinary brainpower and related com-
binatorics innovation, trust, usability and market update will have the best
chances to succeed, and may result in multiplicity: a symbiotic combination
of diverse groups of people working together with diverse groups of machines
to make decisions and solve complex problems. As Commissioner Oettinger

7.7 Conclusion and Recommendations
235
put it on a human-centred IoT: ‘The aim is to empower citizens rather
than machines and corporations, thanks to high data protection and security
standards.’11
With that, the IoT combined with the Internet of Humanity leads to the
Internet of Human Prosperity.

8.1 Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT), as an emerging technology, has the potential to
boost innovation in many industrial sectors, as well as to help address many
societal challenges including climate change, resource and energy efﬁciency
and ageing.
However, this potential will only materialize if IoT develops as an open
platform cutting through the silos, supporting a variety of applications and
generating open and sustainable ecosystems. As for any new technology as it
begins to emerge, there are many proprietary or semi-closed solutions together
a number of existing – and somehow competing – standards, thus re-enforcing
the perception that the IoT landscape is fragmented, in particular for standards.
Theobjectiveofthischapteristopresentthemaininitiativesthatcontribute
to the analysis of the current status and dynamics of the IoT standardization
and to outline their early ﬁndings.
The main contributors of this analysis of the IoT standards landscape
are the AIOTI WG03, the ETSI Specialist Task Force (STF) 505 and the
UNIFY-IoT Coordination and Support Action (CSA).
8.2 Analysing the IoT Standards Landscape
This section introduces three initiatives that target the analysis and under-
standing of the IoT standards landscape. They are brieﬂy described below and
237

238
IoT Standards – State-of-the-Art Analysis
their respective contributions – reference models, identiﬁcation of Standards
Developing Organizations (SDOs), collection of existing standards, and
identiﬁcation of gaps – are further referred to in the rest of the chapter.
8.2.1 AIOTI WG03
Within the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI, www.aioti.eu), AIOTI WG03
(IoT standardization) is a focus point of European engagement and steering
in the standardization process. In collaboration with other AIOTI Working
Groups and STFs, WG03 is:
• Maintaining a view on the landscape of IoT standards-relevant activities
being driven by SDOs, Consortia, Alliances and OSS projects.
• Providing a forum for analysis, discussion and alignment of strategic,
cross-domain, technical themes and shared concerns across landscape
activities.
• Developing recommendations and guidelines addressing those concerns.
AIOTI WG03 is engaging the IoT community in disseminating and promoting
its results and steering emerging standards. In particular, WG03 is expected
to play an important role in conjunction with:
• TheupcomingIoTLargeScalePilots(LSP)(http://ec.europa.eu/research/
participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2223-iot-01-2
016.html) and the IoT LSP large CSAs.
• Other initiatives and cross alliances that have been prepared and will be
launched after theAIOTI GeneralAssembly’s approval on 30 May 2016.
AIOTI WG03 has undertaken parallel tasks on 1) IoT Landscaping; 2) IoT
High-Level Architecture; 3) IoT Semantic Interoperability; 4) IoT Privacy.
A ﬁrst version of the results of this work has been published in November
2015 together with the other AIOTI WGs reports (http://bit.ly/1GtzJ5I). An
updated version of the AIOTI WG03 IoT landscaping report (version 2.6) has
been published at the end of May 2016.
8.2.2 ETSI STF 505
STF505 (https://portal.etsi.org/stf.aspx?tbid=595) is a group of experts,
funded by the European Commission under the rolling plan on ICT stan-
dardization in collaboration with the European Multi-Stakeholder Platform
(MSP) and supported by ETSI, commissioned to provide on the one hand
an in-depth analysis of the IoT standardization landscape (in particular

AIOTI WG03 and the IoT community.

240
IoT Standards – State-of-the-Art Analysis
in conjunction with the AIOTI), and on the other hand, an identiﬁcation of the
IoT standardization gaps.
The study considers “vertical” functionalities (standards and protocols)
in speciﬁc application domains, i.e., a single vertical industry, such as home
automation, smart mobility and wearable medical devices, etc. and “horizon-
tal” functionalities that are not speciﬁc to any particular domain but aim to
provide common standards, protocols and solutions applicable to as many
vertical industries as possible.
The essential objectives are:
• To analyse the status of current IoT standardization.
• ToleverageliaisonsbetweenSDOs,SSOs,andindustrialalliances,which
allows:
◦To assess the industry and vertical market fragmentation vis-à-vis
standardization
◦To point towards actions that can increase the effectiveness of IoT
standardization, to improve interoperability, and to allow for the
building of IoT ecosystems.
• To foster dissemination work for the sustainable development of a global
community of stakeholders involved in the standardization of IoT.
This STF is developing a set of deliverables that will include recommenda-
tions aimed at supporting material for the IoT Large-Scale Pilots (LSPs), in
particular:
1. A technical report (TR) on standards landscape for IoT (who does what,
what are the next milestones) and identiﬁcation of potential frameworks
for interoperability (e.g. oneM2M). The methodology for drafting the
TR on “IoT standards landscaping” is to collect and analyse SDOs and
industry standards, to evaluate their stability and maturity, to analyse
complementarities/antagonism with open source development, and to
provide recommendations.
2. A technical report on identiﬁcation of gaps and proposals on how to
address them in standardization. The methodology for drafting the TR
on “IoT European LSP gap analysis” is to systematically analyse the
SDOs standards and roadmaps with the support of a survey, to map the
LSPs use cases and lifecycle on the related standards, and to identify
gaps in standard support;
3. Athematic workshop on Smart Home covering different LSP application
domains such as Smart Living, eHealth, Wearables and Smart Cities;

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
241
4. An extended delivery workshop centred on the presentation of the STF
results and their application by the winning LSP proposals.
8.2.3 UNIFY-IoT CSA
The objectives of UNIFY-IoT (www.unify-iot.eu) are to stimulate the collab-
oration between IoT projects, between the potential IoT platforms (http://iot-
epi.eu/) and to support them in sustaining the IoT ecosystems developed by
focusing on complementary actions. The overall goal is to foster and stimulate
acceptance of IoTtechnology as well as the means to understand and overcome
obstacles for deployment and value creation.
The UNIFY-IoT CSA is aiming to be a “working partner” of AIOTI and
the IoT European Research Cluster (IERC) by coordinating and supporting
the activities on innovation ecosystems, IoT standardization, policy issues,
research and innovation, and goes beyond the classical workshops and
conferences.
The cooperation framework consists of six dedicated Tasks Forces: Inno-
vation, Platforms interoperability, IoT accelerators, IoT business models,
Educational platforms and International cooperation.
UNIFY-IoT will also establish links with the selected H2020 IoT-01-2016
LSPs and IoT-02-2016 CSAs when they will start to operate at the beginning
of 2017.
8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
In order to ensure a sound and safe methodology to capture the standards
landscape and to identify the standardization gaps, some elements have been
used as a framework for the analysis of the IoT landscape and are described
in this section. Some of them come from the AIOTI WG03 work or from the
STF 505 work and some are a reﬁnement of the AIOTI WG03 work made by
the STF 505.
8.3.1 Horizontal and Vertical Domains
The AIOTI WG03 has deﬁned a way to graphically represent the “IoT SDOs
and Alliances landscape (vertical and horizontal domains)” by highlighting
the main activity of SDOs and Alliances with respect to two dimensions:
• The IoT application domains represented as “verticals”
• The IoT telecommunication infrastructure domain represented as “hori-
zontal/telecommunication”.

242
IoT Standards – State-of-the-Art Analysis
8.3.1.1 Vertical Domains
The vertical domains are those that are addressed by the IoT LSPs as described
below:
• Smart cities.The modern cities need to evolve and become structured and
interconnected places where all components (energy, mobility, buildings,
water management, lighting, waste management, environment, etc.) are
working together for the beneﬁt of humans. By using IoT technologies,
the cities are expected to achieve this transition while maintaining
security and privacy, reducing negative environmental impact and doing
it in a reliable, future proof and scalable manner.
• Smart living environments for ageing well (e.g. smart home). It is
expected that the IoT will support the continuously growing population
of elderly people in living longer, staying active, non-dependent and out
of institutional care settings, together with reducing the costs for care
systems and providing a better quality of life. This should be achieved
in particular with IoT for smart home and home automation supporting
technologies.
• Smart farming and food security. The application of IoT technologies
to the overall farming value chain will enable to produce more with less
resources and negative environmental impacts and will improve at the
same time food safety. Technologies such as data gathering, processing
and analytics as well as orchestrated automation technologies supported
by IoT are expected to achieve this.
• Wearables.Theintegrationofintelligentsystemstobringnewfunctional-
ities into clothes, fabrics, patches, aids, watches and other body-mounted
devices will provide new opportunities and applications. Basic technolo-
gies such as nano-electronics, organic electronics, sensing, actuating,
localization, communication, etc. will be offered to the end-user, with an
associated range of problems such as acceptability, ease of use, privacy,
security or dependability.
• Smart mobility (smart transport systems/smart vehicles/connected
cars). The IoT applied to the mobility domain may create the potential for
major innovations across a wide variety of market sectors, with mobility
applications such as self-driving and connected vehicles, multi-modal
transport systems and “intelligent” transportation infrastructure from
roads or sea ports to parking garages.
• Smart environment (smart water management). IoT will be a key
buildingblocktosolutionsforverticalapplicationssuchasenvironmental
monitoring and control that will use sensors to assist in environmental

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
243
protection by monitoring air, water quality, atmospheric or soil conditions
and noise pollution.
• Smart manufacturing. In support of the European manufacturing indus-
try and of the Factories of the Future, all forms of competitive industries
will have to massively incorporate more intelligence, that will rely in
particular on IoT through advanced connected objects providing sensing,
measurement, control, power management and communication, both
wired and wireless.
The vertical domains are further used for the classiﬁcation of the identiﬁed
standards and standardization gaps.
Note: After the ﬁnal deﬁnition of STF 505, AIOTI has included two new Working
Groups on “Smart Buildings and Architecture” and “Smart Energy” that should be
included in the future extensions of the scope of the IoT Gap Analysis.
8.3.1.2 IoT SDOs and Alliance Landscape
The “IoT SDOs and Alliances landscape (vertical and horizontal domains)”
representation generated by the AIOTI WG03 is illustrated in Figure 8.2
below, in its release 2.6.
This representation captures the SDOs and Alliances that are active in the
horizontal and vertical domains.
It should be noted that this representation includes not only SDOs (that
develop standards for the IoT) but also alliances that very often serve different
purposes such as marketing, promotion, solution proﬁling, etc.
8.3.2 Knowledge Areas
The AIOTI WG03 has deﬁned Knowledge Areas (KAs) that are further used
for the classiﬁcation of Standards in the subsequent sections of this chapter.
The deﬁnition of the AIOTI WG03 KAs is reminded below (with minor
adaptations made by the STF 505):
Communication and Connectivity
This KAcovers mainly speciﬁcation of communication protocols at all layers,
e.g., PHY, MAC, NWK,Transport, Service, andApplication layers. It includes
the management associated with the KA.
Integration/Interoperability
This KA covers mainly speciﬁcation of common IoT features required to
provide integration (assembly of sub-systems) and interoperability (inter-
operation of heterogeneous sub-systems).

Applications
This KA covers the support of the applications lifecycle. This includes devel-
opment tools, application models, deployment, monitoring and management
of the applications.
Note: The application level protocols, APIs, data models, ontologies, etc. are part of
the “Communication and Connectivity” KA.
Infrastructure
This KA covers the design, deployment, and management of computational
platforms and infrastructures (e.g. network elements, servers, etc.) that support
IoT-based usage scenarios.

Devices and sensor technology
This KA covers mainly device and sensor lifecycle management.
Note: The communication protocols between devices and other elements are covered
in the “Communication/Connectivity” KA.
Security and Privacy
This KA covers all security and privacy topics.
8.3.3 High Level Architecture (HLA)
8.3.3.1 The AIOTI HLA
The AIOTI WG03 has developed the AIOTI High Level Architecture for IoT
(AIOTI HLA), a standard framework or architecture for IoT that should be
applicable to IoTLSPs.The HLAis meant to be the basis for further discussion
with the LSP WGs in order to promote architectural convergence among
the WGs.
The AIOTI HLA is similar or can be mapped to other frameworks such as
those developed by ITU-T, oneM2M or IIC. An example of such a mapping
is provided in the next sub-section.
The purpose of AIOTI HLA (and of the other frameworks) is in particular
to support interoperability in complex IoT systems and to provide means of
identifying and deﬁning interworking standards with reduced complexity.This
framework also supports the characterization of standards gaps and is used by
the STF 505 to this extent. A functional model of the AIOTI HLA is depicted
in the Figure 8.3 below.

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
247
The role of the interfaces is to:
• Deﬁnes the structure of the data exchanged between app entities
(the connectivity for exchanged data on this interface is provided by
the underlying networks). Typical examples of the data exchanged
across this interface are: authentication and authorization, commands,
measurements, etc.
• Enables access to services exposed by an IoT entity to e.g. register/
subscribe for notiﬁcations, expose/consume data, etc.
• Enables the sending/receiving of data across the networks to other
entities.
• Enables the requesting of network control plane services such as: device
triggering (similar to “wake on LAN” in IEEE 802), location (including
subscriptions) of a device, QoS bearers, deterministic delivery for a
ﬂow, etc.
• Enables the exposing/requesting services to/from other IoT Entities.
Examples of the usage of this interface are to allow a gateway to
upload data to a cloud server, retrieve software image of a gateway or a
device, etc.
8.3.3.2 Mapping of the HLA:The Example of oneM2M
This fragmented nature of the M2M and IoT market has led to the creation
of oneM2M, an alliance of standards organisations looking to develop a
single horizontal platform for the exchange and sharing of data among all
applications.
oneM2M is creating a distributed software layer, like an operating system,
which is facilitating that uniﬁcation by providing a framework for inter-
working with different technologies, e.g. OMA LWM2M, OCF (previously
OIC) and AllSeen (providing standards for proximity networks). oneM2M
enables interoperability across IoT applications regardless of the underlying
technology used.
oneM2M deﬁnes a Common Services Layer which is a software layer
that sits between the network and applications, be it in the wide area network
domain or in the ﬁled domain (where devices and gateways are generally
deployed). The functions in the Common Services Layer include: device
management, data collection, protocol conversion and interworking, group
management, security, etc. Those functions are exposed to applications (in
the cloud, gateway or devices) via Restful APIs.

248
IoT Standards – State-of-the-Art Analysis
The functional oneM2M architecture is depicted in Figure 8.4. The
reference points deﬁned by oneM2M are:
• Mca: is a Restful API to expose functions in the common service layer
to applications running in the devices, gateways or in the cloud.
• Mcc: is the reference point that allows, among other features, to register
a device or gateway, perform discovery, and exchange IoT data on behalf
of the applications. Mcc is also used to perform device management that
allows managing the lifecycle of the devices. Device management func-
tions include: software and ﬁrmware upgrade, conﬁguration management
and performance management.
• Mcn: is the reference point that allows to access network services,
on behalf of IoT applications, such as device triggering (for sleeping
devices), network location or request quality of service connections for
IoT services that need speciﬁc guarantees.
The Figure 8.5 provides a mapping between oneM2M and the AIOTI HLA
functional model.
oneM2M has speciﬁed all interfaces depicted in Figure 8.4 to a level that
allows for interoperability. Three protocols binding have been speciﬁed, so
far, for Mcc and Mca reference points: CoAP, MQTT and HTTP. As regards
the Mcn reference point, normative references have been made to interfaces
speciﬁed by 3GPP and 3GPP2 in particular.
However, oneM2M does not specify vertical speciﬁc data formats for
exchange between App Entities according to AIOTI HLA interface 1. This
can however be achieved by interworking with other technologies such as
ZigBee, AllSeen, etc.
8.3.3.3 The STF 505 Enterprise IoT Framework
The STF 505 has deﬁned an Enterprise IoT Framework in order to put a global
structure on the framework used for the analysis of the SDO landscape. Such a
framework has to deal not just with the technology, but also with other relevant
area to be taken into consideration such as include the stakeholder views, the
regulatory aspects (e.g. for a city): all these make up an enterprise view.
The AIOTI WG03 reports point out that part of the complexity of IoT
comes from its intention to support a number of different applications covering
a wide array of disciplines that are not all part of the ICT domain: taking
an overview of all these elements can be overwhelming without a structural
view. The STF 505 approach is to view the IoT framework as an Enterprise
Architecture (in line with the TOGAF model for Enterprise Architecture).

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
251
The main elements of this framework shown in Figure 8.6 are the
following:
• An architecture reference model which consists of an IoT architecture
integrating all components that make up an IoT system;
• An IoT domain which holds the view of what makes up an IoT system;
• A standards information database which is the main object of study of
the IoT standards landscaping, aiming to hold all relevant standards that
can be used;
• A reference library which holds any re-useable information that can be
used across the IoT LSP pilots;
• A governance repository that houses all policies, regulations that applies
to any LSP.
The Standards Information Database
Standards are published documents that establish speciﬁcations and proce-
dures designed to ensure the reliability of the materials, products, methods,
and/or services people use every day. The Standards Information Base (SIB)
collects the standards with which new architectures must comply, which may
include industry standards.
Figure 8.6
The IoT enterprise framework.

252
IoT Standards – State-of-the-Art Analysis
AIOTI have come up with a set of standards that are relevant to the LSPs.
Some of the standards are common across the LSPs, while some are speciﬁc for
a LSP. In order to better represent the standards landscape across the various
technology areas, AIOTI have come up with the concept of “knowledge area”
that has been used a classiﬁcation scheme for the standards information base.
Standards and Knowledge Areas
Considering the KAs deﬁned above, it may be appropriate to clarify the kind of
standards that can be expected in a given KA. Some examples are given below.
STF 505 has used this approach for the classiﬁcation of existing standards.
Communication and Connectivity
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Connectivity at physical and link layer
• Network layer
• Service level and application enablers
• Application level API, data models and ontologies
• Management of the protocols
Integration/Interoperability
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Proﬁles
• Certiﬁcation
Applications
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Flexible remote management
• Support methods for installing, starting, updating applications
Infrastructure
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Virtualization
• Mobile-edge computing
• Network management
• Network dimensioning, network planning
IoT Architecture
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Reference architecture

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
253
Devices and Sensor Technology
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Device monitoring
• Sensor/actuators virtualization
• Conﬁguration management
Security and Privacy
Examples of the type of standards that can apply to this KA are:
• Communications security and integrity
• Access control
• Authorization, authentication, identity management
• PII (Personally Identiﬁable Information) management
8.3.4 Status of Standardization in IoT
The IoT has generated the development of standards in order to allow
heterogeneous devices to communicate and to leverage common software
applications. Interoperability is a great challenge for IoT and standards are the
best approach to address it.
Several standardization initiatives currently co-exist, in individual SDOs
or in partnerships (e.g. ETSI SmartM2M, ITU-T, ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC
JTC 1, oneM2M,W3C, IEEE, OASIS, IETF, etc.) and also in conjunction with
a number of industrial initiatives (e.g. AllSeen Alliance, Industrial Internet
Consortium (IIC), Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), Thread protocol,
Platform Industrie 4.0, etc.).
In addition to Figure 8.2 where SDO and Alliances were mapped by using
two axis representing horizontal and vertical domains, theAIOTIWG03 report
on “IoT LSP Standard Framework Concepts” has introduced also two other
dimensions: an horizontal axis that represents the market type and a vertical
axis that represents the technology that these initiatives cover and focus on.
This is displayed in Figure 8.7.
Both of these two ﬁgures convey the visual idea of a multiplicity of
actors (not to mention the additional multiplicity of standards these actors
can produce). It is why the analysis of the IoT standards landscape can give a
more precise answer to the question of the proliferation of standards or of the
fragmentation of the IoT SDO landscape. This analysis will therefore have
several objectives:
• Clarify the issue of SDO landscape fragmentation;
• Identify generic standards that can apply to several vertical domains.
These standards can be corresponding to the “horizontal” domain as
deﬁned by the AIOTI WG03 but also to cross-domain standards;

254

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
255
• Identify standards that are speciﬁc to a vertical domain;
• Identify standards gaps.
8.3.5 Overview of IoT Standards Landscape
Regarding IoT landscaping, the work of STF 505 has been focused on the
identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of existing standards emanating from SDOs.
At the time of this writing, the STF has produced a draft Technical Report
than will soon be submitted to public review. In this draft report, two types of
standards have been identiﬁed:
• “Generic” standards that are common to several vertical domains.Astan-
dard is considered as generic when it is used in at least three of the vertical
domains;
• “Speciﬁc” standards that apply to only one vertical domain.
At this stage, the report (and the standards identiﬁed) is under review and
cannot be presented globally in this paper. The publication of the ﬁnal reports
of the STF 505 is expected in November 2016, making available the full list
of standards that have been analysed.
8.3.5.1 Generic Cross Domain Standards
Anumber of the standards identiﬁed in the IoT landscape are used in several of
the analysed vertical domains. Those standards are listed in tables, classiﬁed
by KAs
• Communication and connectivity
• Integration/interoperability
• Application
• Infrastructure
• IoT architecture
• Device and sensor technology
• Security and privacy
An example of such table with one standard is provided in Table 8.1 where:
• The ﬁrst column is the short name of the SDO;
• The second column is a short description of the standard;
• The third column provides a description and short analysis of the scope
of the standard;

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
Bluetooth is a global wireless
communication standard that
connects devices.
Communication between
Bluetooth devices happens over
short-range, ad hoc networks
known as piconets. The network
ranges from two to eight
connected devices. When a
network is established, one device
takes the role of the master while
all the other devices act as slaves.
Piconets are established
dynamically and automatically as
Bluetooth devices enter and leave
radio proximity. There are
different versions of the core
speciﬁcation of Bluetooth. The
most common are Bluetooth
BR/EDR (basic rate/enhanced
data rate) and Bluetooth with low
energy functionality.

• The seven rightmost columns correspond to the different vertical domains
and the meaning of an “X” in a cell is that the Standard(s) described in
the row apply to the vertical in the column:

◦Smo: Smart Mobility
◦SE: Smart Environment

The number of currently identiﬁed standards per KA and per each vertical
domain are displayed in Table 8.2:
As a conclusion, a large number of standards (a total of 70 standards in the
above table) may apply to several IoT vertical domains. This set of generic
solutions has the potential to provide a common ground to the developers of
IoTsolutions,irrespectiveofthespeciﬁcdomaininwhichtheymaybeapplied.
However, this potential will only materialize if the development of IoT
standards in vertical domains is making effective use of those standards
rather than reinventing similar but not compliant ones, thus increasing the
fragmentation of the IoT standards landscape.
8.3.5.2 Domain Speciﬁc Standards
Each of the vertical domains has a number of speciﬁc standards listed in tables
(sometimes empty, in particular when the “generic” standards fully apply),
classiﬁed by KAs.
An example of such table with one standard is provided in Table 8.3.

BACnet provides a standard way of

One of the object’s most important
properties is its identiﬁer. As devices

8.3.6 Identifying IoT Standards Gaps
8.3.6.1 Deﬁning Gaps
The work done by the STF 505 on standards identiﬁcation (described in the
previous section) has shown that a number of standards are available, i.e. have
reached a ﬁnal stage (Technical standard (TS) or TR, etc.) in a SDO by the
time of writing the report, and can be used for the work of the IoT LSPs.
However, the coverage of the IoT landscape – and the possibility to
develop large-scale interoperable solutions – is not fully guaranteed since
some elements in this landscape are missing. These missing elements are
referred to as “gaps” in this paper. Gaps may also be identiﬁed when har-
monization or interoperability between a large numbers of potential solutions
is missing.
These “gaps” are the main point of interest of the second STF 505 report.
Three categories of gaps will be addressed:
• Technology gaps. Some examples in this category are communications
paradigms, data models or ontologies, software availability.
• Societal gaps. Some examples in this category are privacy, energy
consumption, ease of use.
• Business gaps. Some examples in this category are siloed applications,
value chain, and investment.

8.3 A Framework to Analyse IoT Standardization
259
The identiﬁcation of gaps has been specially made in view of ensuring that
they will be further understood, handled and closed within the IoT community
(and possibly beyond).
This identiﬁcation of gaps relies on an approach that allows for the
characterization of gaps, in particular by understanding the type of gaps (see
above), the scope of the gap, the difﬁculties it generates, and other appropriate
descriptions.
The STF 505 work does not have the aim to undertake the resolution of
the gaps that is left to the proper organizations of the IoT community.
8.3.6.2 Identify Gaps: A User Survey
Acritical part of the identiﬁcation of gaps is the collection of those missing ele-
ments. Since they can be of very different nature and may have been detected
by very different actors of the IoT community, a mechanism is needed to
collect the largest possible information. To this extent, a survey has been built
in order to identify as many gaps as possible with the help of the IoT comm-
unity, in particular the IoT standardization community. The survey aims at:
• Identifying the domain of activity of the respondent;
• Clarifying the respondent objectives and main area of work;
• Deﬁning up to three gaps of all three types described above.
The survey has been largely distributed.At the time of writing this paper, over
190 answers have been collected.
In a second step, these answers have been analysed with the objective
to identify commonalities (i.e. related missing functionalities that can be
considered as one gap) and associated interoperability frameworks.
8.3.6.3 Example of Gaps
The gaps have been analysed for each of the vertical domains. The sources
for the gaps come from both:
• The analysis of the IoT requirements for the vertical domain, based on
a variety of sources. These requirements are matched with the list of
standards identiﬁed in the IoT standards landscaping report and a gaps
is identiﬁed when no standard seems to match the requirement;
• The analysis of the results of the survey regarding the vertical domain.
In this case, the gap has been identiﬁed by the respondent and is further
analysed.
An example of gaps analysis regarding the Connectivity at Network Layer in
the Smart cities domain is shown in Table 8.4.

domain is shown in Table 8.5.

8.3.7 Conclusions and Further Challenges
The work on IoT standards landscaping and IoT standards gaps analysis is an
on-going task that will continue over time. At this stage, the actors involved
have established a solid framework and started to collect the results regarding
the actual standards and gaps.
The work done by the STF 505 will provide a list of standards and a list
of identiﬁed gaps. In particular, these gaps will have to be handled, a task that
is not in the scope of the STF.
It is expected that it will be the role of AIOTI WG03 and of the IoT LSP
and the Coordination and Support Actions (CSA) starting in 2017.
AIOTI WG03 is addressing three key challenges as displayed in Table 8.6
and speciﬁc challenges as displayed in Table 8.7 derived from the landscape
analysis with collaborations of contributors based on consensus, providing
guidance and recommendations on speciﬁc technical themes, and around an
understanding of how that guidance will be disseminated in an effective way.
This will help to achieve the overall goals as set by the European
Commission, and promote the use of open standards that:
• Support the entire value chain,
• Apply within IoT domains and cross-IoT domains.
• Are integrating multiple technologies, based on streamlined international
cooperation and which enables easy and fair access to standard essential
patents (SEPs).

9.1 Introduction
The scope of Internet of Things (IoT) European Platforms Initiative
(IoT-EPI) is to create ecosystems of “Platforms for Connected Smart
Objects”, integrating the future generations of devices, embedded systems,
network technologies, and other evolving ICT advances.
These environments support citizens and businesses for a multipli-
city of novel applications. They embed effective and efﬁcient security and
265

266
IoT Platforms Initiative
privacy mechanisms into devices, architectures, service and network plat-
forms, including characteristics such as openness, dynamic expandability,
interoperability, dependability, cognitive capabilities and distributed decision
making, cost and energy-efﬁciency, ergonomic and user-friendliness.
Such smart environments are enriched through the deployment of wear-
able/ambulatory hardware to promote seamless environments. The platforms
from the beginning involve and connect technology developers and appli-
cation developers and complementors who will enhance the impact of the
IoT platform. The IoT European Platforms Initiative is coordinated by two
consortia UNIFY-IoT, Be-IoT and include seven research and innovation
projects.
The IoT-EPI program includes the research and innovation consortia that
are working together to deliver an IoT extended into a web of platforms for
connected devices and objects. The platforms support smart environments,
businesses, services and persons with dynamic and adaptive conﬁguration
capabilities.
The goal is to overcome the fragmentation of vertically oriented closed
systems, architectures and application areas and move towards open systems
and platforms that support multiple applications. The European Commission
funds the IoT-EPI with EUR 50 millions. The projects are presented in the
following sections.
9.1.1 AGILE Project: A Modular Adaptive Gateway for IoT
AGILE builds a modular and adaptive gateway for IoT devices. Modularity
at the hardware level provides support for various wireless and wired
IoT networking technologies (e.g., KNX, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Bluetooth Low
Energy, etc.).
It allows fast prototyping of IoT solutions for various domains (e.g., home
automation, environment monitoring, wearables, etc.).
At the software level, different components enable new features: data
collection and management on the gateway, intuitive interface for device
management, visual workﬂow editor for creating IoT apps with less coding,
and an IoT marketplace for installing IoT apps locally.
The AGILE software can auto-conﬁgure and adapt based on the hardware
conﬁguration so that driver installation and conﬁguration is performed auto-
matically. IoT apps are recommended based on hardware setup, reducing the
gateway setup and development time signiﬁcantly.

9.1 Introduction
267
Figure 9.1
The AGILE project overview.
9.1.2 The Challenges
Prototyping an IoT solution is a complex process that involves the careful
selection of appropriate components, both at the hardware and software level.
On the hardware side, there are many wireless and wired communication
technologies and protocols to choose from and support. For non IP-based
networks, there is always a need of a gateway for connecting smart objects to
the Internet. Unfortunately, gateways provided by vendors nowadays cannot
beextendedeasilytosupportnewprotocolsandaredomain-speciﬁcandclosed
solutions.
From the software perspective, the plethora of communication proto-
cols complicates the selection of the most appropriate ones for device
communication with external services and Machine to Machine (M2M)
interaction.

268
IoT Platforms Initiative
IoT vendors implement their own Cloud-based solutions that are vertical,
product-oriented and closed, since there is no standardized way of creating
end-to-end IoT applications and no wide acceptance of an IoT platform model.
This leads to great privacy and data control issues.
9.1.3 The AGILE Solution
AGILE creates an open, ﬂexible and widely usable IoT solution and puts it at
the disposal of industries (start-ups, SMEs, tech companies) and individuals
(researchers, makers, entrepreneurs) as a framework that consists of:
• A modular IoT gateway enabling various types of devices (wearables,
home appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.) to be connected with each other
and to the Internet;
• Data management and device control maximizing security and privacy,
at local level and in the cloud, technologies and methodologies to better
manage data privacy and ownership in the IoT;
• Support of various open and private clouds;
• Recommender and visual developer’s interfaces enabling easy creation
of applications to manage connected devices and data;
• Support of mainstream IoT/M2M protocols, and SDKs from different
standardization bodies for device discovery and communication;
• Two separate gateway hardware versions: a) the “makers” version, based
on the popular RaspberryPi for easy prototyping and b) the “industrial”
version for more industrial and production ready environments.
9.1.4 The AGILE Use Cases
To demonstrate the applicability of theAGILE modular hardware and software
gateway, the project is developing the following use cases in ﬁve different
pilots:
• Quantiﬁed Self (wearables for self-tracking)
• Crop and livestock monitoring using drones
• Air pollution monitoring
• Port radiation and pollution monitoring using drones
• Smart retail solutions for enhanced shopping experiences.
AGILE will become part of the existing IoT-Lab infrastructure in France
managed by INRIA. With more than 2.500 sensors deployed in ﬁve locations,
AGILE users will have the opportunity to evaluate their IoT applications in
real environments, collect and store sensor data, and interact with real devices.

9.2 BIG IoT: Bridging the Interoperability Gap of the IoT 269
9.2 BIG IoT: Bridging the Interoperability Gap of the IoT
Despite various research and innovation projects working on the IoT, no
broadly accepted professional IoT ecosystems exist. The reason for that are
high market entry barriers for developers and service providers due to a
fragmentation of IoT platforms. Developers who want to make use of smart
objects hosted by various providers need to negotiate access to their platforms
individually and implement speciﬁc adapters. Since the efforts to negotiate
individual contracts often outweigh the possible gains, platform providers do
not see strong incentives to open their platforms to third parties.
The goal of this project is to overcome these hurdles by Bridging the
Interoperability Gap of the IoT (BIG IoT) and by creating marketplaces for
service and application providers as well as platform operators.
Previous EC-funded projects that address such enablement of IoT ecosys-
tems are, e.g., IoT-A1, by providing a common architecture, FIWARE2 that
offers Generic Enablers as building blocks, or projects such as compose3 and
OpenIoT4, which offer dedicated IoT platforms to aggregate other platforms
andsystems.BIGIoTwill notdevelopyetanotherplatforminordertoenable
cross-platform IoT applications. Instead, we will address the interoperability
gap by deﬁning a generic, uniﬁed Web API for smart object platforms,
called the BIG IoT API. The establishment of a marketplace where platform,
application, and service providers can monetize their assets will introduce an
incentive to grant access to formerly closed systems and lower market entry
barriers for developers.
With this approach based on the generic BIG IoT API, an IoT ecosystem
will come to life, as it will offer a functionally rich but at the same time easy
way to discover, access, control, manage, and secure smart objects.
The API will be designed in an open community process and the project
consortium will engage with current standardization initiatives to receive
input and deliver contributions to speciﬁcations. The BIG IoT API will be
implemented by overall eight smart object platforms.
Following an evolutionary and agile approach, the developed technologies
will be concurrently demonstrated in three regional pilots involving partners
with strong relation to public authorities. Under a common theme of “smart
mobility and smart road infrastructure”, various use cases within the pilots
will validate the developed technologies.

To foster the external implementation of the BIG IoT API the project
will conduct focused dissemination and exploitation activities to leverage the
developer community. Further, an Open Call will be conducted as part of the
project to engage SMEs in the implementation of the services, applications,
and platforms conforming with the BIG IoT.
9.3 bIoTope: Building an IoT Open Innovation Ecosystem
for Connected Smart Objects
New IoT applications that leverage ubiquitous connectivity, system intero-
perability and analytics, are enabling Smart City initiatives all over the world.
Although the smart city paradigm paves the way for societal and economic
opportunities (e.g., to reduce costs for societies, foster a sustainable economic
growth, etc.), they also pose architectural and structural issues that must be
addressed for businesses to beneﬁt. One of the most critical obstacles is the

9.3 bIoTope: Building an IoT Open Innovation Ecosystem
271
vertical silos’ model that shapes today’s IoT, which hampers developers –
due to the lack of interoperability and openness – to produce new added
value across multiple platforms (data is “siloed” in a unique system, cloud,
domain, and stays there). Several organisations and standardization fora have
understood this critical challenge and started to build up consortia and IoT
initiatives to address it.
The Open Group was among the ﬁrst ones with the IoT Work Group
established in 2010 [1]. More recent initiatives are, for example, the Web of
Things initiative at W3C that aims to create open ecosystems based upon open
standards, including identiﬁcation, discovery and interoperation of services
across platforms; the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) launched by the EU
with the aim of strengthening links and building new relationships between the
differentIoTplayers(industries,SMEs,start-ups);theOpenPlatform3.0TM at
The Open Group that focuses more on organization applications and practices;
the OneM2M global standards initiative that involves eight standards bodies
for M2M communications; or still the IEEE IoT initiative.
Although most of those initiatives promote various types of standards and
speciﬁc technology enablers, they all share the same vision about relying
as much as possible on open and interoperable standards to foster open
ecosystems and unlock the commercial potential of the IoT. While in the
US, IoT ecosystems are created around big, multinational players such as
Apple or Google, the EU’s strength is rather in smaller and agile companies.
Several past EU initiatives gave rise to a multitude of IoT platforms in various
domains [2] (e.g., OpenIoT cloud platform, BUTLER, FI-WARE, etc.).
Despite these efforts, it is a key challenge for the EU to turn those initial
IoT platforms into economically viable entities and ecosystems. This is the
current focus and goal of the H2020 ICT30 R&I Programme that is composed
of two support action projects and seven R&I projects. In this chapter (in the
next two sections), we brieﬂy introduce the vision, objectives and building
blocks underlying one of these projects named bIoTope (standing for Building
an IoT OPen innovation Ecosystem for connected smart objects), along with
a brief overview of the smart city pilots that will be developed.
9.3.1 Building Blocks Underlying the bIoTope Project
This section provides a brief overview of key building blocks that underlie the
bIoTope ecosystem, namely (i) IoT standards that will be used as interoper-
ability enablers across various IoT platforms, and (ii) context-aware services

272
IoT Platforms Initiative
(CoaaS) that provide systems with reasoning capabilities that allow them to
react appropriately to new situations.
9.3.2 O-MI and O-DF Standards
Primary goal of bIoTope is to enable companies to easily create new IoT
systems and rapidly harness available information using advanced Systems-
of-Systems (SoS) capabilities for Connected Smart Objects. To this end,
bIoTope takes full advantage of messaging standards developed and ofﬁcially
published by The Open Group, notably the Open Messaging Interface (O-MI)
and Open Data Format (O-DF) [3, 4] standards.
Those standards emerged out of past EU FP6-FP7 projects, where real-
life industrial applications required the collection and management of product
instance-level information for many domains involving heavy and personal
vehicles, household equipment, etc.
Based on the needs of those real-life applications, and as no existing stan-
dardscouldbeidentiﬁedthatwouldfulﬁlthoserequirementswithoutextensive
modiﬁcation or extensions, the partner consortia started the speciﬁcation of
new IoT interoperability standards. O-MI provides a generic Open API for
implementing RESTful IoT information system, also using other underlying
protocols than HTTP as illustrated in Figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3
Positioning of O-MI and O-DF in IoT protocol stack.

9.3 bIoTope: Building an IoT Open Innovation Ecosystem
273
O-DF provides a generic content description model for Objects in the IoT
that can be extended with more speciﬁc vocabularies (e.g., using domain-
speciﬁc ontology vocabularies).
In the same way as HTTP can be used for transporting payloads in formats
other than HTML, O-MI can be used for transporting payloads also in other
formats than O-DF [5].
When used together, O-MI and O-DF provide the necessary tools for “any”
IoTinformation systems to interoperate successfully in ad hoc manners, which
is necessary also for dealing with context.
9.3.3 Context-as-a-Service
Context awareness and provisioning (i.e., CoaaS) is a key feature of bIoTope
ecosystem. CoaaS will be providing relevant, dependable, trustworthy real-
time and historical context to bIoTope services, pilots, platforms and appli-
cations through open APIs. Context is deﬁned as “any information that
can characterise a situation of an entity” [6]. Tremendous opportunities
and challenges exist in implementing and organizing such context-aware
systems on different scales, ranging from context-aware printing; context-
aware enterprises that respond with agility to an understanding of physical
circumstances; context-aware toys that interact with children aware of their
age, abilities, parental constraints, context-aware parking areas that tell drivers
where to go, to context-aware road intersections that warn drivers of dangerous
situations [7].
Context awareness R&D efforts in bIoTope focus on a powerful theoretical
framework that enables domain-agnostic representation of context, reasoning
about and validation of context. Very little research has been done on context-
and situation-prediction [8]. Solid theoretical methods including Particle
and Kalman ﬁlters, Bayesian Networks, machine learning and Dempster-
Shafer theory, Markov models and Reinforcement learning underpin CoaaS.
Computationally efﬁcient context fusion from multiple heterogeneous IoT
sources is very much a fundamental challenge that is also being addressed
in bIoTope. The CoaaS will therefore provide run-time support for advanced
context-awareness through context prediction, proactive adaptation, privacy
and UI awareness, and personalisation that will lead to the emergence of
intelligent, user and object-driven and user-centric services. Our context ser-
vice components will be open, O-MI/O-DF compliant and, most importantly,
scalable.

9.3.4 bIoTope Large-Scale Pilots
Two categories of pilots will be developed in bIoTope to validate the
effectiveness of the bIoTope SoS ecosystem for IoT, namely:
• Domain-speciﬁc pilots: ensure industrial impact through customer net-
works of bIoTope partners addressing electric car charging stations,
self-managing buildings and smart air quality;
• Cross-domain smart city pilots: provide proofs-of-concept of IoT system
composition and interoperability scenarios in smart city environments
(Helsinki,Brusselsregion,GrandLyon)includingsmartmetering,shared
electric vehicles, smart lighting, etc., as illustrated in Figure 9.4.
9.4 INTER-IoT: Interoperability of Heterogeneous
IoT Platforms
INTER-IoT project aims at the design, implementation and experimentation
of an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology and tools to
enable voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. The
proposal will allow effective and efﬁcient development of adaptive, smart
IoT applications and services atop different heterogeneous IoT platforms,
spanning single and/or multiple application domains. The project will be
tested in two application domains: port transportation and logistics and mobile
health; additionally, it will be validated in a cross-domain use case.

are isolated from “the rest of the world”. In a few cases where heterogeneous
elements are integrated, this is done either at device or network level, and
focused mostly on unidirectional gathering of information [9]. A multi-
layered approach to integrate heterogeneous IoTdevices, networks, platforms,
services and data will allow heterogeneous elements to cooperate seam-
lessly to share information, infrastructures and services as in a homogenous
scenario [10].
9.4.1 Open Interoperability
Lack of interoperability causes major technological and business issues
such as impossibility to plug non-interoperable IoT devices into heteroge-
neous IoT platforms, impossibility to develop IoT applications exploiting

IoT Platforms Initiative
multiple platforms in homogeneous and/or cross domains, slowness of IoT
technology introduction at a large-scale, discouragement in adopting IoT
technology, increase of costs, scarce reusability of technical solutions, and
user dissatisfaction [11].
The main goal of the INTER-IoT project is to comprehensively address
lack of interoperability in the IoT realm by proposing a full-ﬂedged approach
facilitating “voluntary interoperability” at any level of IoT platforms and
across any IoT application domain, thus guaranteeing a seamless integration
of heterogeneous IoT technology [11].
INTER-IoT aims to provide open interoperability, which delivers on the
promise of enabling vendors and developers to interact and interoperate,
without interfering with anyone’s ability to compete by delivering a superior
product and experience.
In the absence of global IoT standards, the INTER-IoT project will support
and make it easy for any company to design IoT devices, smart objects,
and/or services and get them to the market quickly, thus creating new IoT
interoperable ecosystems.
The solution adopted by INTER-IoT will include three main products or
outcomes (see Figure 9.5):
• INTER-LAYER: methods and tools for providing interoperability
among and across each layer (virtual gateways/devices, network, middle-
ware, application services, data and semantics) of IoT platforms. Speciﬁ-
cally, we will explore real/virtual gateways [13] for device-to-device
communication, virtual switches based on SDN for network-to-network
interconnection, super middleware for middleware-to-middleware inte-
gration, service broker for the orchestration of the service layer and a
semantics mediator for data and semantics interoperability [14].
• INTER-FW: a global framework (based on an interoperable meta-
architecture and meta-data model) for programming and managing
interoperable IoT platforms, including an API to access INTER-LAYER
components and allow the creation of an ecosystem of IoT applications
and services.
• INTER-METH: an engineering methodology based on CASE (Com-
puter Aided Software Engineering) tool for systematically driving
the integration/interconnection of heterogeneous non-interoperable IoT
platforms.

IoT Platforms Initiative
9.4.2 Use-Case Driven
The INTER-IoT approach will be use case-driven, implemented and tested in
three realistic large-scale pilots:
• INTER-LogP: will be designed and built to speciﬁcally accommo-
date the communication and processing needs of moving vehicles and
cargo items (being conceived as moving things according to the IoT
paradigm), e.g., by seamless and secure integration of various vehicle
telematics solutions as well as mobile devices serving as retroﬁtting
equipment. It will work over smart containers (i.e., reefers and IMOs6),
trucks and different infrastructures, allowing exchange of information
associated with the operations and movements of containers inside the
terminal.
• INTER-Health: aims at developing an innovative, open integrated
m-Health IoT platform for humans monitoring in a decentralized way
and in mobility. The integrated platform, derived from existing platforms
(i.e., e-Care Tilab platform and BodyCloud) [15], will be open to be
further enhanced by integrating new subsystems by using the INTER-IoT
approach.
• INTER-DOMAIN: a cross-domain pilot involving IoT platforms from
different application domains, including transport and logistics but
extendable to other domains.
9.5 symbIoTe: Symbiosis of Smart Objects Across IoT
Environments
The IoT is evolving around a plethora of vertical platforms, each speciﬁcally
suited to a given scenario and often adopting proprietary communications,
device and resource control protocols.
The emerging need for cross-domain IoT applications and services high-
lights the necessity of interoperability across IoT platforms for a uniﬁed and
secure sharing of and access to sensing/actuating resources.
symbIoTe (Symbiosis of smart objects across IoT environments) steps into
this landscape to devise an interoperability framework across existing and
future IoT platforms.
6IMO containers are used to transport safely dangerous goods, available at http://
www.imo.org

9.5 symbIoTe: Symbiosis of Smart Objects Across IoT Environments
279
The framework will enable the discovery and sharing of resources for
rapid cross-platform application development and will facilitate the blending
of next generation of smart objects with surrounding environments.
9.5.1 The Vision
symbIoTe aims at introducing IoT platform federations, provisioning of
domain-speciﬁc enablers, sharing of IoT resources and new business models
in the IoT landscape.
Vertical IoT solutions focus on speciﬁc activities of everyday life, but are
restricted to the ecosystem that can be created around a single platform (see
“Closed Private” IoT Business models in [16]). Through federations, multiple
IoT solutions can collaborate so as to i) provide cross-domain solutions, and
ii) share IoT resources and the respective measurements in locations originally
out of their reach.
For the co-creation of cross-domain solutions it is important that expertise
in a certain domain by existing solutions is exploited. To achieve this, current
IoT solution providers should wrap and offer their domain-speciﬁc platforms
in a “Sensing as a Service” manner [17]. This way, important and useful
information with respect to a single domain can be provided to third parties,
in the form of a domain-speciﬁc enabler, typically after some pre-processing
and aggregation.
To deal with the increasing complexity of IoT systems and reduce the
deployment costs, collocated platforms can choose to be cooperative by
opening up the access to their resources to third parties and by implementing
generichigh-levelAPIs.Inaddition,theymaychoosetocollaboratebysharing
the common physical resources in a coordinated way.
Putting the technical details aside, the federations among IoT solution
providers need to be supported by the appropriate business models in order
to be viable. While basic literature on IoT business models is arising [18],
the horizontal integration in federations deserves more speciﬁc considerations
since the current IoTvalue chain includes more stakeholders like infrastructure
providers, IoT platform providers, Cloud operators, ISPs and application
developers.
9.5.2 The Technical Approach
symbIoTe builds around a hierarchical IoT stack connecting smart objects
and IoT gateways within smart spaces with the Cloud. Smart spaces share
the available local resources, while platform services running in the Cloud

280
IoT Platforms Initiative
should enable federations and open up northbound interfaces to third parties.
The architecture comprises four layered domains, as depicted in Figure 9.6.
The Application Domain offers a high-level API for a uniﬁed view on
differentplatformstoenablecooperationandsupportcross-platformdiscovery
and management of IoT resources, as well as data acquisition and actuation
in accordance with platform-speciﬁc business rules.
The Cloud Domain hosts the Cloud-based building blocks of speciﬁc plat-
forms. To enable platform federations and sharing of resources, a symbIoTe
interworking interface will be deﬁned and implemented for the exchange of
information between two collaborating IoT platforms.
The Smart Space Domain comprises smart objects, IoT gateways as
well as local computing and storage resources. To enable dynamic sensor
discovery and conﬁguration, as well as dynamic sharing of the wireless
medium, symbIoTe introduces the symbIoTe middleware, which will expose
a standardized API for resource discovery and conﬁguration within a smart
space, and implement a sensor-discovery protocol for a simpliﬁed integration
of sensors with platforms hosted in particular smart space domains.
The Device Domain spans over heterogeneous devices, which should
be capable to dynamically blend with the surrounding environment and get
discovered by the symbIoTe middleware. Smart objects can be conﬁgured on
the ﬂy to be integrated with different IoT platforms hosted within the smart
space, preventing the lock-in to speciﬁc IoT platforms.
9.5.3 The Use Cases
symbIoTe use cases are targeting typical daily environments to assist people
seamlessly while performing their daily activities. The diversity of the
considered environments is ideal to showcase platform interoperability.
Smart residence will enable automatic discovery and conﬁguration of
devices in homes and ofﬁces as well as sharing of available resources between
collocated platforms. The basic idea is to exploit local resources and dynamic
service composition to manage and access functions across any available
device.
Smart campus will develop campus-wide smart services across various
platforms with a focus on collaboration services which utilize indoor naviga-
tion and room/equipment booking. In addition, it will enable “eduroam-like”
IoTservicesforvisitingstudentsandstaffandshowcasedeviceroamingacross
IoT domains.

Smart stadium will enable indoor location services while supporting strict
security and privacy policies. The goal is to link digital and physical worlds
so as to create a unique experience for stadium visitors.
Smart Mobility and Ecological Routing will bring together existing city-
wide air quality measurement infrastructures with wearable air quality sensors
to predict the total emission levels commuters are exposed to. A domain
speciﬁc enabler will offer a service for the calculation of the ecologically
preferable routes for motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians.
Smart Yachting will automate the information processes between a boat
and the mainland, to allow i) users on a boat to identify automatically the
territorial services and ii) the port authorities to automatically send various
land information to the boat, e.g., during the mooring phase.
9.6 TagItSmart
TheIoTisaboutconnectingobjects,things,anddevices,billionsofthem.What
is still out of reach due to technological limitations and the cost of deployment
are mass-market products: a carton of milk, a package of steak, a basket of
apples, a book, a CD etc. Today, these products are identiﬁed by printed tags
(such as barcodes or QR codes). These codes relate to the product they tag, not
to the unique unit/object that holds the tag. Once attached to an object, tags are
usually static and the information they provide does not change, regardless of
the state or events happening in the immediate environment of that product.
9.6.1 Vision
Leveraging the features of functional codes (such as QR codes printed
using functional inks) to change according to the context changes of each
tagged product together with wide availability of smart phones that can
capture/record/transmit these codes we can create context sensors for mass
market products and convert mass market products into connected mass
market products with unique identity that can report on their environment.
This opens up possibilities for a completely new range of services to be
created and consumed by the user, and for the user. The outcome will be the
creation of an almost infrastructure-less IoT framework applicable in multiple
industry sectors.
Funcational ink + optical tags + crowd sourced smartphone
= IoT for mass market products

9.6 TagItSmart
283
9.6.2 Objectives
The overall objective of TagItSmart is to create a set of tools and enabling
technologies integrated into a platform with open interfaces enabling users
across the value chain to fully exploit the power of condition-dependent
functionalcodestoconnectmass-marketproductswiththedigitalworldacross
multiple application sectors.
TagItSmart will deﬁne a framework, enabling technologies and the tools
required to design and exploit functional codes across multiple application
sectors in a secure and reliable manner. The project will leverage clearly
identiﬁed and well-established catalysts (i.e., functional inks, printed circuit
NFC, smartphones pervasiveness and cloud computing) to enable inclusion
of any mass market product into the world of connected objects.
Functional inks and printed NFCs will be used to create functional codes,
which will provide sensing capabilities to the objects they are attached to.
Product manufacturers, shopping centres, supply chain providers and other
stakeholders from different sectors will be able to leverage the framework
to easily and automatically produce and deploy these codes according to
their needs and the properties they need to observe and track. Functional

IoT Platforms Initiative
codes scanners (ﬁxed and provided by existing infrastructure, or supported
by participatory engagement of consumers) will be used to obtain data from
functional codes throughout the product lifecycle.
9.6.3 The Approach
ThefollowingarethemaincharacteristicsoftheTagItSmartproject’sapproach
and methodology:
1. Leverage and re-use the existing solutions, components, architectures,
communities, ecosystems, do not build from scratch.
2. Build open systems, use open source and interact with other relevant
initiativesandecosystemsidentiﬁedincollaborationwiththecommunity.
3. Start building a community and an ecosystem immediately from the
beginning of the project.
4. Use co-creation methodology to specify new use cases, listen and be agile
to react on the input.
5. Pilot solutions early. Involve community in evaluation. Iterate.
6. Use open calls to address new use cases and extend TagItSmart
Functionality.
7. Aim to create commercial opportunities already during the project.
9.6.4 Industry Impact
Consumers will be able to get additional assurance about authenticity of
the product, information about the way the item in hands was handled,
transported etc. as well as to receive other services and incentives provided
by manufacturers, retailers and third party service providers.
Manufacturers will be able to track individual items they manufactured
throughout the product lifetime, thus offering insights into how the item is
being handled, used and ﬁnally disposed of as well as enabling them to interact
directly with the consumers.
Retailers will be able to monitor individual items on the shelves, improve
logistics and supply chain and offer new services to consumers.
Developers will be able to build applications and services on top of
the open API and provide them to consumers whenever a tagged product
is scanned.
The TagItSmart project includes two open calls for the third parties willing
to build new components for TagItSmart framework as well as new services
leveraging the provided open API. For this activity, a budget of €1.2 million
has been allocated.

9.7 Vicinity
285
9.6.5 Use Cases
The TagItSmart project plans to address at least the following 5 use cases.
1. “Digital Beer”: Digital beer is a product that is marked with functional
codes, during its production and distribution using the TagItSmart plat-
form. For the digital beer, the TagItSmart enables item-level control,
lifecycle management, digital engagement and authenticity control. The
functional codes’ sensing capabilities make it possible to track products
internal and external conditions throughout the lifecycle.
2. “Lifecycle and Consumer Engagement”: This use case will implement
a system that allows full lifecycle management of every fast-moving
consumer good (FMCG) that motivates and helps companies and citizens
to recycle their waste items, overcoming the current limits.
3. “Brand protection”: Brand protection is a serious issue that matters to
manufacturers of both high value products such as high fashion textiles
and accessories, and low value products manufacturers likeAspirin. This
use case reveals a simple but powerful method for authenticity checking
that could act either as a stand-alone security platform or as an added
feature to other TagItSmart use cases.
4. “Supply Chain and Dynamic Pricing”: This use case provides con-
sumers with the capacity to check the time elapsed from when the product
is packaged, and the conditions in which it is stored and transported to
the shelf, on top of other basic product information. The products can
at the same time be priced dynamically reﬂecting the goods condition,
eliminating the end consumers’ doubt about the quality or the price of a
product.
5. “Home Service”: This is a use case for a new business model. By
moving the value downstream along the supply chain, the retailer acts as
a service provider or as a trusted 3rd party. Additional services on top of
the traditional after-sale services can be provided to customers, making
them better enjoy the services and products, improving their satisfaction
level.
9.7 Vicinity
VICINITY – “Interoperability as a Service for the IoT: a bottom-up
approach” [20]
The VICINITY project will build and demonstrate a platform and ecosys-
tem for IoT infrastructures that will offer “Interoperability as a Service”.

286
IoT Platforms Initiative
The platform aims to be device and standard agnostic, and will rely on a
decentralised and user-centric approach. VICINITY aims to retain full control
of the ownership and distribution of data across the different IoT domains.
VICINITY introduced the concept of virtual neighbourhood, where users
can share the access to their smart objects without losing the control over
them. A virtual neighbourhood will be a part of an IoT infrastructure that
offers decentralised interoperability and will release the vendor locks that are
present in the current IoT ecosystems.
New independent value added services across IoT domains may beneﬁt
from the availability of the vast amount of data in semantic formats that are
generated by IoT assets.
9.7.1 Challenges
The lack of integration across different disciplines, vendors and standards
prevents exploitation of the huge potential in successful large-scale IoT
implementations.
It is difﬁcult to control the data ﬂow and privacy settings within a virtual
neighbourhood consisting of IoT devices, and it creates both social and
technological barriers, which affects the development of new value-added
services.
Identifying, conﬁguring, managing and updating information concerning
the IoT ecosystem demands technical expertise, which makes it less feasible
for the smaller stakeholders, and ultimately may lead to slow adoption rate
among the users that may be in the most need – especially within the
eHealth and assisted living domain. This is however also something that
inﬂuence smart home appliances and green energy implementations, as well
as how smart home systems are tied in with transportation and the nearby
surroundings.
9.7.2 VICINITY Solution
VICINITY presents a virtual neighbourhood concept. A decentralized
approach resembling a social network will be used. The users are allowed
to conﬁgure installations and integrate standards according to the preferred
services, as well as being able to fully control their desired level of privacy.
Data exchange between different devices is handled through the
VICINITY open interoperability gateway, which reduce the need for having
a technical background in order to exploit to the VICINITY ecosystem.
An API will allow for easy development of an adapter to the platform.
Once an IoT infrastructure is integrated, its owner can simply manage the

9.7 Vicinity
287
access to his/her IoT data and controls using the VICINITY neighbourhood
manager (VNM).
Connecting to detected IoT infrastructures is handled by the open VICIN-
ITY auto discovery device. The device will automatically discover the smart
objects. These devices will appear in a device catalogue, and will allow the
users to manage access rules for the discovered smart objects.
9.7.3 Demonstration and Impact
VICINITY will provide an IoT platform that can connect islands that were
previously isolated, and will allow integration of end-users and creation of new
business models. VICINITY will pave the way for large-scale demonstration
of the applicability of the solution in different use cases that implement
and demonstrate different value-added services on top of the VICINITY
platform.
The ﬁrst use case will be a smart energy micro-grid that is enabled by
municipal buildings (Enercoutim, PT). The VICINITY value-added services
will provide users with information on potential energy savings and thereby
increase awareness of the contributors.
The second use case will show how to combine infrastructure from
different domains: a Smart Grid ecosystem will be combined with anAssisted
Living use case (Tiny Mesh, NO).
Figure 9.8
VICINITY overview.

288
IoT Platforms Initiative
The third use case will be eHealth (GNOMON, GR) which looks at the
speciﬁc needs and constraints of eHealth. Value-added services will include
the detection of abnormal events, and the possible ﬁnding and clustering of
similar patients based on data mining.
The ﬁnal use case will show how a large number of data sources from
different domains can be combined in an intelligent parking application
(Hafenstrom, NO). This will use data from booking, heating management
and health status while considering how users can be incentivised to use the
application.
VICINTY is open and welcomes the participation of further interested
consumers, integrators and developers of value-added services.
9.8 Be-IoT
The vision of Be-IoT is to build a broad and vibrant ecosystem for the
overall project IoT-EPI increases the collaboration of the research and
innovation projects within the overall initiative, generates economic impact
through new innovative business models and creates trust in the IoT by
transparent information about societal challenges such as privacy and security
implications.
SMEs have been set to take on a very important role as a focus group in
Europe, since SMEs are at the heart of innovation in the economy. They play
a vital role with their capacities to generate new ideas and quickly transform
these into business. Their importance is illustrated in the Small Business Act
(SBA) and also reﬂected in the Horizon2020 industrial leadership mission,
which states that Europe needs innovative SMEs to create growth and jobs.
Their importance and needed support to create new business is reﬂected in the
Be-IoT project.
Be-IoT is establishing a structure for supporting the development of
standardized IoT technologies and disseminating those with the goal to derive
use case applications and business models and to create societal acceptance
of IoT applications across Europe.
Be-IoT project builds the bridge between IoT-EPI and relevant stake-
holders (e.g., potential customers such as European SMEs as well as larger
corporations, entrepreneurs and developers, but also researchers, policy
makers and investors) and thus expand the ecosystem massively.
The main goal of the Be-IoT project is to build an adopter’s ecosystem
focussing on developers, entrepreneurs and end-users.

9.9 UNIFY-IoT 289
Innovation activities such as idea challenges, business model challenges
and hackathons create awareness and make sure a variety of end-user interests
will be taken into account when building the platforms.
Idea challenges and business model challenges derive speciﬁc business
opportunities. Best practices and use cases will be derived from these
and implementation will be pursued, in collaboration with both investors
and SMEs.
The project will work on stimulating the platform adoption by hosting
idea and business challenges and hackathons, while setting the ground for
upcoming business building activities by creating awareness and also by
facilitatingandfosteringsocietalacceptance(e.g.,byrunningavarietyofinno-
vation, communication to the businesses and to the public and dissemination
activities).
9.9 UNIFY-IoT
UNIFY-IoT objectives are to stimulate the collaboration between IoT projects,
between the potential IoT platforms and support these in sustaining the IoT
ecosystems developed by focusing on complementary actions, e.g., fostering
and stimulating acceptance of IoT technology as well as the means to
understand and overcome obstacles for deployment and value creation.
UNIFY-IoT is the “working partner” of the Alliance for IoT Innovation
(AIOTI) and the IoT European Research Cluster (IERC) by coordinating and
supporting the activities on innovation ecosystems, IoTstandardisation, policy
issues, research and innovation.
The overall concept underpinning UNIFY-IoT is to stimulate strategic
cooperation and cross project support between the projects and potential
Figure 9.9
UNIFY-IoT activities overview.

290
IoT Platforms Initiative
platforms that will be used, conceived and developed under IoT-EPI. UNIFY-
IoT aim is to:
• Identify new research and innovation mechanisms
• Derive joint exploitation strategies on how to make successful ecosys-
tems emerge;
• Involve and coordinate the cooperation with the AIOTI, ECSEL JTI,
cyber-physical stakeholders;
• Give input on and support extend the international cooperation
• Respond to the societal challenges for Europe.
The main activities are focusing on:
• Value co-creation – bringing together the various stakeholders in the
IoT ecosystem to work towards a mutually agreed outcome using IoT
interoperable solutions and evaluate the value co-creation by analysing
the results of the projects.
• IoT Business Models – surveying and analysing existing business
models related to IoT: from speciﬁc deployment in case of process
optimisation in a company, to, at the opposite, providing a technological
element to the open markets, and produce a taxonomy of business models.
• Innovation Support – analysing existing IoT platform deployments and
analyses at the innovation and other activities of those deployments. It
assesses the relative success of the platform adoptions and identiﬁes
common innovation activities in the most successful platforms.
• IoT Open platforms concepts – building upon on the open platforms
activity chain started by the IERC an combine it with other initiative
documenting project outcomes.
• IoT Education platform – interacting with stakeholders to identify
opportunities for interaction between IoT platforms and education insti-
tutions to ensure that future graduates are conversant with emerging IoT
platforms and the opportunities they present. UNIFY-IoT is leveraging
the knowledge process supporting the emergence of an IoT Curricula and
education platform in Europe.
• Standardisation Support – sensing the global trends in term of interop-
erability and de-facto standards, and interacts with standardisation bodies
including ETSI and CEN/CENELEC to systematise de facto standards
emerging from the IoT-EPI projects. The project is cooperating closely
with the working group on standardisation of the AIOTI to ensure a
coordinated approach to standardisation.

The IoT is now a global happening that is requiring cooperation at inter-
national level to address its key challenges. Europe has established as a
priority the international cooperation on IoT research and innovation. The
work revolves around aligning strategies and plans for IoT globalisation
293

European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
but also exploring differentiations, and speciﬁcities for local exploitation of
IoT. Notice: EU is cooperating with African countries on cost-effective open
IoT innovation; Europe is supporting Brazil to build-up its IoT ecosystem
supported on EU best practices; the EU-China IoTAdvisory Group is active on
pushing global IoT standards while developing competitive IoT solutions; the
EU-Japan joint cooperation follows-on on the integration/federation of IoT
with Big Data and Cloud; and the EU-Korea engagement is looking at major
global IoT standardisation activities; EU-US cooperation is active especially
via the respective global IoT initiative frameworks, the AIOTI and IIC. And
cooperation is expected to start with India on the vision of a connected and
smart IoT based system for their economy, society, environment and global
needs. This chapter reports on EU international cooperation activities with
partner countries and regions on the Internet of Things (IoT).
10.1 Introduction
The importance of international cooperation in science and technology is
explicitly recognised in the European Union’s Innovation Union ﬂagship
initiative and the projects for Horizon 2020, the EU funding programme for
research and innovation. On September 14th, 2012, the European Commission
set out its new approach to international cooperation under Horizon 2020 in
a communication entitled “Enhancing and focusing EU international cooper-
ation in research and innovation: a strategic approach” [1]. In-line with this
approach, international cooperation activities developed under Horizon 2020
should contribute to the objectives of:
• Strengthening EU excellence and attractiveness in research and innova-
tion and its economic and industrial competitiveness;
• Tackling global societal challenges; and
• Supporting the Union’s external policies.
The Commission’s Communication document calls for a systematic and
coherent identiﬁcation of priorities for international cooperation with the EU’s
partner countries and regions, with a view to subsequently implementing
these through activities with the necessary scale and scope, in particular in
the context of Horizon 2020. The Communication equally stresses that this
strategic priority setting exercise should fully reﬂect the state of play in the
policy dialogues between the EU and its partner countries.
To ensure that international cooperation activities are developed on the
basis of common interest and mutual beneﬁt and create win-win situations,
the Communication offers four criteria for guiding the identiﬁcation process.
International cooperation adds value when:

295
• Synergies and complementarities can be created in research and innova-
tion capacity;
• There are opportunities for access to new or emerging markets;
• The activities contribute to meeting the EU’s international commitments,
as e.g., in the Millennium Development Goals;
• There are adequate legal and administrative frameworks in place to
engage in cooperation, also including lessons learnt from previous
cooperation.
The Communication also calls on this priority setting process to be reﬂected
in multi-annual road maps for international cooperation with its key partner
countries and regions. The road maps for international cooperation, which are
included in a StaffWorking Document [2], provide examples of the outcome of
this priority setting exercise. For each of the partner countries and regions, they
provide a full overview of the framework governing the cooperation and the
current state of play as regards the cooperation, including information on the
way this has been addressed in the ﬁrst Horizon 2020 work programmes. Most
importantly, they provide an overview of what are considered to be the priori-
ties for future cooperation (using a medium term perspective) with the partner
in question, reﬂecting the current state of agreement in the policy dialogue.
As far as International cooperation in IoT is concerned, we can recall on
important cooperation aspects as presented above:
• Need to think global for tackling global societal challenges;
• Need to identify synergies and complementarities that can be created in
regards to research and innovation capacity;
• Need to look at economic dimension and business opportunities for
strengthening EU’s excellence and attractiveness in research and inno-
vation and its economic and industrial competitiveness; opportunities to
access new or emerging markets.
The cooperation with countries presented in this chapter highlights either
importantcooperationactionsleadingtogetglobalsolutions(e.g.,onstandard-
isation, governance, privacy) or important differentiation to address new mar-
kets (e.g., affordable solutions for Africa, new IoT solutions for Brazil, etc.).
10.2 IoT in South Korea and Cooperation with EU
South Korea is known early adopter of new technology and ranked in IDC’s
‘IoT Index’ for 2013. South Korea government has established the ‘Mid- and
Long-term R&D plan for IoT’that links existing R&D projects classiﬁed into

296
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
parts of the entire ecosystem. Based on the roadmap, many activities and
projects are occurring across South Korea. While South Korean’s govern-
ment is helping collaboration between companies, research institutions and
universities, individual companies and developers are contributing the entire
IoT ecosystem. Also there are strong R&D cooperation between the private
sector and the military, which is expected to contribute to advancement of
the military applications, and improve leadership in international standards
through joint research with major countries including the EU1. A recent
IoT related R&D direction in South Korea is moving towards integrating
AI technologies to IoT in order to support intelligent IoT services. Here,
various IoT related activities fostering the IoT ecosystem in Korea are
described.
10.2.1 Open Innovation and Open Platform
One of the key criteria that the South Korean government highlights in
strategy and planning is ‘Open Innovation and Open Platform’. Different
from traditional industry, IoT has a characteristic that anyone interested can
develop and provide services using global standards based open platforms. In
such environment, ideas can easily be developed into new services, and the
potential of each individual can be maximised.
In order to launch IoTservices quickly, there needs to exist an ecosystem so
that developers and users can actively participate and share their technologies
and experiences. Open Alliance for IoT Standard (OCEAN) is an example
of open innovation and platform to foster the IoT industry supported by
the government. OCEAN is a consortium sharing open source and software
products that are developed based on the IoT international standard oneM2M
to help enhance coordination between companies and help develop the IoT
industry. The consortium started with some 50 ﬁrms and institutions but now
has more than 350 ﬁrms worldwide. The IoT platform distributed via OCEAN
had been developed through government support.
10.2.2 Large-Scaled IoT Pilot Projects
In order to foster the deployment of IoT solutions in South Korea, the South
Korean government have identiﬁed several areas including smart city and
1EU and Korea reafﬁrmed to strengthen the agreement of the Nov’2013 summit, where both
sides agreed on promoting R&D collaboration in the area of ICT including the IoT.

10.2 IoT in South Korea and Cooperation with EU

daily healthcare. The government selected these areas based on their large
inﬂuence to on people’s daily life.
In the case of IoT-enabled Smart Cities, Busan, which is the second largest
city in South Korea (3.6 M population), teams up with a consortium that
comprises of industry and academic members in order to foster an ecosystem
for smart city industry and support for Korea’s small- and medium-sized
companies in various sectors, e.g., social security, transportation, energy
efﬁciency and urban life. A main purpose of the Busan smart city is to
establish an open smart city platform based on a global IoT/M2M standards
(i.e., oneM2M) and implement an IoT enabled test bed in Busan. The city is
designed to guarantee an interoperability between S (Service) – P (Platform) –
N (Network) – D (Device) – Se (Security) ecosystem and meet global standard
to prepare global City-to-City interoperability and enable expansion to the
ecosystem in Busan intends to provide public information about infrastructure,
transportation, security and safety, so that new services and technologies
using such information can be boosted. The planned services included smart
streetlights,alostchildpreventionsystem,smartparkingandabuildingenergy
management system.
The government also supports a similar large-scaled IoT pilot project
together with the city of Daegu focusing on daily healthcare. In order to make
sure all IoT data, devices and services are interoperable, all IoT enabled large
scaled projects are recommended to use the same global IoT/M2M service
layer standards, i.e., oneM2M. In this way, these large scaled IoT test beds
can guarantee sustainability even after ﬁnishing project periods.
10.2.3 Global Collaboration
The IoT is commonly recognised as a fundamental game changing technology
across many industrial sectors and social solutions. Many experts and studies
agree that the biggest challenge for the IoT is to overcome market fragmenta-
tion and to achieve interoperability between many established silos and global
IoT platforms. Therefore, South Korea government strongly supports global
collaboration. A new project called WISE-IoT has been started as part of
jointly funded R&D programs between South Korea and EU. As shown in
table Table 10.1, the project is a joint endeavour with leading IoT companies,
research institutes and universities to provide global semantic interoperability.
WISE-IoT has a plan to extend existing IoT reference architectures for
achieving interoperability and interworking while strengthening oneM2M
deployments. The project started from the existing test beds and experimental

systems built upon current reference implementations for the various IoT
systems, e.g., oneM2M systems in Korea, FIWARE in Europe, LoRa in
both regions, and various local IoT technologies such as OCF and AllSeen.
These solutions will be made interoperable by semantic annotation of the
basic data and a speciﬁc reasoner with the knowledge for using semantic
information.
The economies in Europe and South Korea are high-tech, knowledge-
based societies that are selling products and services across the globe. WISE-
IoT aims to enable new business in which essential features like information
analytics, intelligent decision making, and reliable execution of workﬂows and
processes can remain in the control of the knowledge workers, while services
can be quickly applied to any new IoT data lake as it becomes available in
a new city or factory. The outcome of the project will help to establish new
global value chains. The cooperation of South Korea and EU is essential to
lead the way to the global IoT services and new value chains around the world.
Apart from the WISE-IoT project, South Korea also established a “Global
Council of Public and Private sectors for IoT” and the ‘IoT Innovation Center’
to improve partnerships between software, device, or user businesses and large
businesses/SMEs. This scheme aims to foster small yet strong IoT businesses
for global expansion by providing education for creative entrepreneurship and
conducting projects in teams of large companies and SMEs.
10.3 Global IoT Challenges Seen from China
Note: For ﬁve years, EU and China experts met about twice a year to discuss
cooperation on IoT. The result of discussion is now available in a white paper

10.3 Global IoT Challenges Seen from China
299
on EU-China cooperation for IoT [3]. The summary below is based on the
content of the white paper.
In China, the IoT has become an important carrier for strategic information
industries and integrated innovation. The Central Government and local
authorities have consistently attached great importance to IoT through the
Inter-Ministerial Joint Conference, the tenth action plans for the IoT devel-
opment and the annual special fund for IoT development giving substantial
support for industrial development. As a result, China’s IoT development
shows now a strong momentum of development. In 2014, China’s IoTindustry
scale expanded beyond 620 billion yuan, with a year-on-year growth of
24% [22].The M2M terminals in China exceeded 73 million units, with a year-
on-year growth of 46%, accounting for 30% of the global total [4]. Beijing-
Tianjin, Shanghai-Wuxi, Shenzhen-Guangzhou, and Chongqing-Chengdu
form the four core industry clusters with their unique features, where a number
of leading enterprises have emerged. Moreover, IoT third party operation
service platforms are rising in trafﬁc, security, health care, IoV, energy-saving
areas, and IoTaaS.
10.3.1 China Policy on IoT
China’s IoT policies emphasise on demonstration and cluster effects, and
the policy environment will continue to be improved from the top design,
organisational mechanisms, think-tank support and other ﬁelds of activities:
• Planning documents pointing out directions for development of stages:
following the 12th Five-Year-Plan for IoT development, China’s State
Council issued the Guidance on Advancing Orderly and Healthy IoT
Development, which further clariﬁed the goals, ideas and areas of focus
of China’s IoT development;
• Establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Joint Conference system and the
Expert Consultation Committee for IoT development: the NDRE, the
MIIT, and the most coordinated for the top-level design of the IoT
development and promoted IoT development in China;
• Formulation of ten action plans for IoT development: the plans cover
various perspectives, including top-level design, standard development,
technology development, application and promotion, industry support,
business models, safety and security, supportive measures, laws and
regulations, personnel trainings, etc.;
• Financial support such as the special fund for IoT development: the
annual support directions of the special fund are set against the

300
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
development demands from key IoT technology R&D projects and IoT
systems development projects in key are as during the year; additionally,
the annual support measures will to be adjusted and optimised.
10.3.2 IoT Applications in China
From a macroscopic perspective, China’s IoT application development
presents two typical types: “focus-oriented objective” and “overall and global
covering objective”. The “focus-oriented objective” are IoT applications in
speciﬁc industries: CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) for mapping virtual models
to the real world, while IoT is the core of CPS.
In the ﬁeld of industrial manufacturing, IoT has been widely applied
in intelligent equipment management, environmental real-time monitoring,
materials/product tracing and other areas. The applications of CPS will
enhance the efﬁciency of intelligent manufacturing by 20%, cut the cost down
by 20%, and save energy/reduce emission by 10% [5].
In the ﬁeld of agriculture, IoT cuts the personnel costs for crop cultivation
by about 50% and improves the overall economic beneﬁt by about 10%. High
precision environmental control in greenhouse facilities can be realised with
the help of sensor-based automatic adjustment, and the high-quality green
vegetables products cultivated for a high-end customer segment are priced 10
times higher than normal green vegetables [6].
In the ﬁeld of energy conservation and environment protection, dynamic
energyefﬁciencymodelscanbeestablishedbasedonlargedatathroughenergy
management virtualisation, which can precisely locate the peak and valley
electricity consumptions and then balance the peak and valley consumptions
to save energy and reduce emission. For large industrial parks, the lighting
energy reduction alone can be reduced by more than 30% [7].
In areas of urban management, pipe network monitoring, and intelligent
transportation, the IoThas greatly enriched the urban management instruments
and enhanced the urban management capacity. In transportation, 65% of the
buses and near 70,000 taxis [8], passenger cars and dangerous chemicals
vehicles in Beijing have been ﬁtted with satellite positioning equipment, and
ﬁve taxi monitoring centres and rail trafﬁc control centres have been set up
for intelligent management of all kinds of transportation.
10.3.3 IoT Trends and Standards
China has acquired important knowledge in network architecture, new types
of sensors, M2M and other technologies. The WIA-PA (Wireless Networks

10.3 Global IoT Challenges Seen from China
301
for Industrial Automation – Process Automation) has been applied on a large
scale in the oil and the electricity areas. The Huawei LTE-M system, which
features low power consumption, low cost, low data rate and wide coverage,
meets the needs of M2M applications and is now in the experimental stage
for business deployment.
In the area of network structure, the release of the international standard
ITU-T Y.2068 led by CAICT was completed in 2015. The Wuxi IoT Industry
Research Institute and the China Electronics Standardisation Institute under
the MIIT jointly promoted the approval of the ISO/IEC 30141 project, and
have also proposed a consistent system decomposition model and an open
standard design framework.
In the area of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors,
China’s sensor enterprises sensibly grasped the new needs and new tech-
nologies of MEMS sensors, and have developed core technologies such as the
MEMS acceleration meter technology, the MEMS sensor chip development
and production test technology based on proprietary thermal detection method,
the 5 million pixel CMOS image sensor based on the back lighting technology,
the CMOS-MEMS process and the wafer level integrated package process.
The ﬁrst pilot-scale production line for the complete MEMS process has
been built and the manufactured systems have been widely used in security
monitoring, automotive electronics, consumer electronics and other ﬁelds.
For M2M (Machine-to-Machine) network platforms, both China Mobile
and China Telecom are vigorously promoting the construction of M2M
platforms. Studies on the optimisation of the existing networks and the
M2M narrowband networks represent the current focus of activity. China
will continue to promote standardisation work for network optimisation,
including terminal triggering, low power consumption and wide coverage,
as well as network congestion. Huawei and other device manufacturers
have been carrying out research and development on narrowband M2M
business supporting technologies, and have promoted the standardisation of
the narrowband network.
10.3.4 The Internet and the Reconstruction
of the Industrial Ecology
Chinese enterprises have demonstrated strong innovation ability in application
services and business models. With the mobile Internet extending to IoT in
recent years, Chinese Internet enterprises have emerged as the most dynamic
powers in the development of IoT, and have been strongly inﬂuencing the

302
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
patterns, models and industrial ecological system of China’s IoT development.
Major Chinese Internet companies have entered the ﬁeld of IoT through
wearable intelligent terminals, smart home, mobile health care, IoV, security,
and other businesses, and have made rapid development in some of these areas.
On one hand, IoT applications can expand to be national-level applications
in no time by virtue of mobile Internet portals and the large user scale. On
the other hand, mobile APPs have become the data aggregation centres and
feedback nodes for IoT. The anti-lost devices for children are integrated with a
Bluetooth function, indicating children’s distance from their parents, an alarm
function when children are being beyond safe distance of their parents, and
a four-fold location function, allowing parents to know the locations of their
children at any time from a mobile APP.
10.3.5 EU-China Cooperation Proposal in IoT
The EU-China joint white-paper, published in January 2016 [3], has provided
a list of cooperation items. The main ones are presented next.
10.3.5.1 Policy Level Cooperation
Encourage and actively promote research and innovation cooperation, and
publication of results. Improve the EU-China cooperation policy and mech-
anisms in scientiﬁc research and innovation from a strategic and operational
perspective, for elaborating policy recommendations. Encourage enterprises,
institutions, and individuals on both sides to actively participate in cooperation
projects and to form a long-term cooperation mechanism between the EU and
China. At a later stage, and given that conditions are right in terms of fully
reciprocal access to each other’s RDI programmes, joint undertakings and
calls will be considered as a further step.
The mechanism should be installed on two levels: governmental level and
project level, preferably on a larger scale. For the ﬁrst mechanism, policies
should be investigated on both sides and provide input for the yearly EU-China
ICT Dialogue. For the second mechanism, a wider scope of beneﬁciaries shall
be considered including IoT Large Scale Pilots and Megaprojects.
10.3.5.2 Technical Cooperation
Carry out twinning activities between IoT Large Scale Pilots and Mega
projects on IoT key technologies such as the IoT architectures, test-beds and
platforms, semantic and technical interoperability, thus making full use of the
knowledgebase and advantages of both regions. Encourage enterprises to carry
out technical cooperation in strategic sectors on key product development,

10.4 Adapting IoT to New Needs: Challenges from Brazil
303
which can help each of the parties involved to break through technical
bottlenecks and promote the process of high-tech industrialisation on a recip-
rocal basis. Expertise can be enhanced and cultivated through short, medium
and long-term exchanges of PhD and post doctorial students, faculty staff,
industry researchers. This should also be considered for entire institutes and
companies.
10.3.5.3 Standards Cooperation
Encourage EU-China mutual support and jointly push the development of
international standards for the IoT business layer, in the activities of inter-
national standardisation organisations such as OneM2M, ETSI, CEN/ ISO,
IEEE, ITEF and ITU-T. A joint position paper on EU-China IoT standardis-
ation mapping including recommendations should be elaborated, which can
thus provide a reference for the future EU-China standards cooperation. This
should also include a consideration of domain speciﬁc standards which could
be done in conjunction with large scale projects as mentioned in previous
section.
10.3.5.4 Market Cooperation
Strengthen EU-China information exchange and cooperation between the
technology innovation strategic alliance of the IoT industry in China and
Alliance for IoT Innovation in the EU to establish an effective market supply
and demand platform for European and Chinese enterprises, which can expand
bilateral industrial research and innovation activities. Joint market analyses of
potential applications of IoT in diverse ﬁelds are needed to instate conﬁdence.
Mutual studies on topics related to IoT large scale projects could be a means
of providing this conﬁdence.
10.4 Adapting IoT to New Needs: Challenges from Brazil
The IoT has received a lot of attention in Brazil in the last years by the
academic communities, companies and Brazilian agencies. Innovation and
entrepreneurship communities formed by start-ups and SMEs are very active
in IoT. In fact, IoT has been viewed as one of the best opportunities in decades
to foster Brazilian economic and social development. In order to promote IoT
development, Brazilian funding institutions have also provided funding lines
addressing IoT, Smart Cities, Smart Utilities and Advanced Manufacturing.
Large companies such as Intel, Huawei, Cisco, Ericsson, IBM and Samsung,
have invested in RD&I centres in Brazil. Joint calls EU-Brazil are also an

304
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
important mechanism to foster research in IoT and IoT related technologies
and applications.
However, the adoption of IoT in Brazil has been slow, mainly due to
the required investments. In order to foster IoT development, it is still
necessary to address also points like human resources education and training,
standardisation, interoperability, adoption of open standards and platforms,
privacy and security, among others. Furthermore, Brazil needs to increase
its participation in international standardisation bodies and also get better
conditions to collaborate with international initiatives.
10.4.1 IoT RD&I Funding in Brazil
Recent calls for proposals from important funding institutions, such as
FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation), addressing Smart Cities inno-
vative projects, and BNDES (Brazilian Development Bank), addressing a
technical study to diagnose and propose a public policy to foster IoT devel-
opment and application in Brazil, show the importance Brazilian agencies are
starting to give to IoT.
The BNDES calls for proposals complements other efforts at Federal
government level in IoT. Additional actions include: 1) elaboration by the
Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development (ABDI) of a technical study
diagnosing the Brazilian industrial competence in Smart Grids and Smart
Cities; draft document of these studies have mapped the Brazilian ICT
Industrial Supply-Chain Smart Grids [9]; and 2) Ministry of Communication
(MiniCom) that coordinates the special chamber for M2M/IoT matters. The
actions are not completed, however funding agencies such as FINEP(Funding
Authority for Studies and Projects) and BNDES are members of the chamber
and certainly will be looking for respond on the demands of the M2M/IoT
chamber.
10.4.2 IoT Success Cases in Brazil
IoT applications in Brazil normally have been made in small scale, and
the corresponding business models are to be better studied and developed.
Many different types of development have been made, ranging from medical
support, agriculture, smart cities and smart grids. Currently, in Brazil, IoT
use cases have been more focused in logistics, applying Real Time Location
Systems (RTLS) technology. Today there are many systems in development
and/or in operation. One system (Clever Care) made by Kidopi start-up
(http://kidopi.com.br/) in the medical area was considered by ONU (World

10.4 Adapting IoT to New Needs: Challenges from Brazil
305
Summit Award – United Nations – World Summit on the Information Society
2015) one of the ﬁve better medical applications in the world.
10.4.2.1 RFID/IoT Change of Paradigm
The most successful case of IoT application in Brazil corresponds to BRAS-
COL, a wholesale company. BRASCOL successfully employed RFID to
introduce a new management of inventory model. It reached a tremendous
successintermofperformanceandcostsavings.Andthiswaspossiblebecause
the owners took the risk to identify all the products that they sell independent
of its sale price. This decision was made against the “orthodox thinking” that
each product should be able to pay for its cost. The gains in the total operation
were very signiﬁcant proving that it was a savvy decision.
10.4.2.2 Smart Metering and Smart Grids
As a result of the effort that has been made by the government and companies
in order to achieve a better energy efﬁciency. It is expected a roll-out of smart-
meters in the electric sector, starting in 2016 with 1 million units in the state
of Rio de Janeiro, going to 2 million by 2017 in the state of São Paulo and
reaching its peak by 2020. Notably, the Total Available Market (TAM) of
Brazil in respect to smart meters is of 78 million units.
In Smart Grids, the ABNT (Brazilian Association of Technical Standards)
along with the COBEI (Brazilian Committee of Electronic, Electricity and
Lighting) are working on standards for Smart Meters through 8 working
groups. In telecom, several companies are conducting studies and trials on
LPWA (SigFox by Telefonica Vivo Brazil) and LoRa (Unitec).
10.4.3 International Standardisation Related to IoT
In the international scenario, it is observed a large number of IoT related
standardisation initiatives: ISO, OMG, ITU, IEEE, etc. These standardisation
efforts compete with each other in standards. Being a founding member of
ISO the Brazilian National Standards Organisation (ABNT) follows ISO Stan-
dards. Historically, Brazil have not been a strong participant in standardisation
entities. In the IoT, there is some activity only in speciﬁc application areas,
such as Smart Grids and Telecommunications.
10.4.4 EU-Brazil Collaboration on IoT
EU-Brazil cooperation in the area of ICT is regarded as having a crucial
strategic value and high societal impact. It has been developing since the

306
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
launch of the ﬁrst coordinated joint call back in 2011. The cooperation is
supported by an EU-Brazil dialogue on Information Society with speciﬁc
working groups in some areas addressing not only research and innovation
matters but also ICT policy and regulatory aspects. The main activities in the
IoT are presented next.
10.4.4.1 EU-Brazil Joint Call for IoT Pilots RIAs
The Brazilian government and the European Commission have decided to
launch the 4th coordinated call, to open in November 2016, in two main
areas: cloud computing and IoT Pilots. Priorities for the call and for the devel-
opment of future technologies are the 3O’s: Open data, Open platform, Open
science.
The IoT pilots call is to fund actions that validate and demonstrate IoT
approaches and already developed IoT technologies and tools, to speciﬁc
socio-economic challenges in real-life settings. The call will support three
projects proposing pilots in ﬁve areas of interest, namely: (1) environmental
monitoring; (2) smart water management; (3) energy management at home
and in buildings; (4) smart assisted living and wellbeing; and (5) smart
manufacturing focused on customisation.
Pilots are expected to empower citizens, both in the public and private
spheres, and businesses, as well as improve the associated public services,
for improved sharing of information, approaches and solutions, as well as
expertise. Pilots should take place on both sides and across theAtlantic, involv-
ing end-users, establish common benchmarks, contribute to standardisation,
open-source and open-data repositories and link with ongoing work in the IoT
Focus Area.
10.4.4.2 EU-Brazil Mapping and Comparative Study
European stakeholders are supporting Brazil in the context of the sectorial
dialoguesforcyberneticpolicyonthedevelopmentoftheM2M/IoTecosystem
by performing an EU-Brazil mapping and comparative study. The action is
being promoted by the Ministry of Communications of Brazil.
The general objectives of the project are: – establish the basis for the
participation of Brazil together with Europe in the development of policies
and regulation to overcome any trade, technological or legal barriers that
might hamper the development of the IoT ecosystem; – collaborate with
setting IoT standards and features in Brazil and Europe; – Extend the existing
collaborative research between Brazil and Europe; – Brazil’s participation
and contribution to future cooperation agreements for research; – Harmonize
actions between the Brazilian and European IoT chambers.

10.5 Do More with Less: Challenges for Africa
307
The outcomes are expected to: (i) provide valuable information for the
development of Brazilian public policies for the promotion and application
of the IoT/M2M ecosystem. (ii) improve capacity of the Brazilian state for
international cooperation and joint action in the ﬁeld of telecommunications
and IoT platform applications; (iii) be input to deﬁne concrete steps to
integrate an action plan (roadmap) of collaboration; (iv) be a contribution
to deﬁne possible agreements for research activities and joint work between
the thematic chambers of M2M/IoT from Brazil and Europe.
10.4.4.3 The EU-Brazil FUTEBOL Project
The H2020-688941 FUTEBOL project works towards the creation of a
federated control framework to integrate test beds from Europe and Brazil
for network researchers from academia/industry with unprecedented features.
The major goal is to allow the access to advanced experimental facilities in
Europe and Brazil for research and education across the wireless and optical
domains.
The FUTEBOLproject consortium argues that the needs of future telecom-
munication systems, be it from high data rate applications in smart mobile
devices, machine-type communications (M2M) and the IoT, or backhaul
requirements brought about from cell densiﬁcation, require the co-design of
the wireless access and the optical backhaul and backbone.
As an example, FUTEBOL will integrate the Bristol-is-Open (BiO) city-
scale and real-life test bed and will offer it to experimenters. BiO supports
IoT and data centre infrastructure integration with the wireless and optical
backbone of a city infrastructure ecosystem. This will create opportunities for
wider adoption of FUTEBOL’s experimental facility, both within smart cities
and the wider industry.
10.4.4.4 Further Work on EU-Brazil Cooperation
Since Horizon 2020, Brazilian entities are not entitled to receive funds from
the European Union. This situation weakened the presence of SME’s as the
Brazilian structure of funding does not allow any type of company to get funds
from the federal government. So, the EU needs to keep working with Brazil
to ﬁnd other ways for this funding. One option is to work more synchronised
with FAPESP and Foundations from other states also.
Also it would be very useful to get joint works that can map the Brazilian
companies that are interested in cooperative projects and their interest areas.
The Brazilian IoT Forum has done some works in this direction and is now in
a process to assemble an International Advisory Committee and could be an
agent to disseminate in Brazil this collaboration EU-Brazil in IoT.

10.5 Do More with Less: Challenges for Africa. Low-Cost
IoT for Sub-Saharan African Applications
ICT in the African context must be seen as a horizontal enabler in all areas of
service delivery: eHealth, eGovernment, eAgriculture, eEnvironment, eEdu-
cationandeInfrastructures[10].Inseveralcases,ICThasenabledconvergence
of productive sectors, serving as platform for more holistic development. In
fact, there are many examples of ICT developments in Africa that cut across
traditional sectors: notable examples are the introduction of micro-health
insurance and health-savings accounts through mobile devices; index-based
crop insurance; crowd-sourcing to monitor and manage the delivery of public
services. These innovative applications – for several reasons more disruptive
in social terms than many counterparts in the EU – recognize and leverage
commonalities between sectors, blur traditional lines, and open up a new ﬁeld
of opportunities.
Most of ICT success stories in Africa address very concrete issues of local
populations. For instance, it is reported that 70% of the population of Senegal
relies on cattle raising as their main source of revenues. When those animals
are stolen, some families are left in such dramatic situation that cases of suicide
are not unheard of [11]. DARAL [12] was a ﬁrst attempt to ﬁght against cattle
rustling with the help of technology. For instance, it provides a web application
for cattle identiﬁcation and is currently implemented in 5 zones with 1500
farmers and 18000 cattle registered. DARAL emerged from an initiative of
Coders4africa where 5 teams of 4 developers worked from collecting end-
user requirements to the development of the ﬁnal application. DARAL was
one of those. For now, the current system is mostly a human-based cooperative
alerting system based on SMS exchanges but automatisation can be foreseen
by integrating active communicating components in the process, following
the IoT trends.
Therefore, the opportunity of IoT applications in Africa is huge and it is
not a question any more on whether IoT will come or not: many companies
have already deﬁned internal business activities to go along with this global
move. However, when developed countries discuss about massive deployment
of IoT, African countries are still far from being ready to enjoy the smallest
beneﬁt of IoT: lack of infrastructure, high cost of hardware, complexity in
deployment, lack of technological eco-system and background, etc. [13].
In Sub-SaharanAfrica about 64% of the population is living outside cities.
Theregionwillbepredominantlyruralforatleastanothergeneration.Thepace
of urbanisation here is slower compared to other continents, and the rural pop-
ulation is expected to grow until 2045. The majority of rural residents manage

10.5 Do More with Less: Challenges for Africa
309
on less than few Euros per day. Rural development is particularly imperative
where half of the rural people are depending on the agriculture/micro and
small farm business, other half faces rare formal employment and pervasive
unemployment. For rural development, technologies have to support sev-
eral key application sectors like health, water quality, agriculture, livestock
farming, climate change, etc. Therefore, when deploying IoT in Sub-Saharan
African countries, it is necessary to target the removal of three major barriers:
(1) Lower-cost, longer-range communications; (2) Cost of hardware and
services; and (3) Limit dependency to proprietary infrastructures, provide
local interaction models. These are further detailed next.
10.5.1 Lower-Cost, Longer-Range IoT Communications
Vast distances and poor infrastructure isolate rural areas, leaving those who
live there poorly integrated into modern ICT ecosystems. Deploying IoT in
this context must use longer range wireless communication to decrease both
the complexity and the cost of data collection. Using the telco mobile com-
munication infrastructure, when coverage is available, is still very expensive
(e.g., GSM/GPRS) and deﬁnitely not energy efﬁcient for autonomous devices
that must run on battery for months. Recent so-called Low-Power Wide
Area Networks (LPWAN) such as those based on Sigfox(TM) or Semtech’s
LoRa(TM) technology deﬁnitely provide a better connectivity answer for IoT
as several kilometres can be achieved without relay nodes to reach a central
gateway or base station. When adding the ﬁnancial cost constraint and the
network availability, LoRa technology, which can be privately deployed in
a given area without any service subscription, has a clear advantage over
Sigfox which coverage is entirely operator-managed. Some LoRa community-
based initiatives such as the one promoted by The Things Network [14] may
provide interesting solutions and feedbacks for dense environments such as
cities but under the agriculture/micro and small farm business model an even
more ad-hoc and autonomous solution need to be investigated and deployed.
On the software side, the software service platform will also need to offer
highly innovative monitoring, recommendation, notiﬁcation services based on
the data coming from multiple rural application sectors, taking into account
that, in most cases, the mobile phone is the unique technological terminal for
end-users.
10.5.2 Cost of IoT Hardware and Services
The maturation of the IoT market is happening in many developed countries:
innovative and integrated products are available for smarter home and various

310
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
monitoring applications. While the cost of such devices can appear reasonable
within developed countries standards, they are deﬁnitely still too expensive
for very low-income sub-Saharan ones. The cost argument, along with the
statement that too integrated components are difﬁcult to repair and/or replace
deﬁnitely push for a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and “off-the-shelves” design
orientation. To be sustainable and able to reach previously mentioned rural
environments, IoT initiatives in developing countries have rely on an innova-
tive and local business models. We envision mostly medium-size companies
building their own “integrated” version of IoT for micro-small scale services.
In this context, it is important to have dedicated efforts to design a viable
exploitation model which may lead to the creation of small-scale innovative
service companies.
The availability of low-cost, open-source hardware platforms such as
Arduino-like boards is clearly an opportunity for building low-cost IoT
devices from mass-market components. For instance, boards like Arduino
Pro Mini based on an ATmega328 microcontroller offers an excellent
price/performance/consumption trade-off and can be used to provide a low-
cost platform for generic sensing IoT with LoRa long-range transmission
capability. In addition to the cost argument (cost can be less than 15 euro for
a fully operational long-range sensing device) such mass-market component
greatly beneﬁts from the support of a world-wide and active community of
developers.SeeinFigure10.1theexperimentalset-upswithArduinoProMini.
With the gateway-centric mode of LPWAN technology, commercial gate-
ways are usually able to listen on several channels and radio parameters
Figure 10.1
Generic platform with Pro Mini (left), packaged for battery-operated and
outdoor deployment (right).

10.5 Do More with Less: Challenges for Africa
311
simultaneously. They use advanced concentrators radio chips that alone cost
more than a hundred euro. Here, again, the approach can be different in
the context of agriculture/micro and small farm business: simpler "single-
connection" gateways can be built based on a simpler radio module, much
like an end-device would be. Then, using Linux-based platforms such as the
Raspberry PI that has high price/quality/reliability trade-off, the cost of such
gateway can be less than 45 Euro. See in Figure 10.2 the prototypes of the
low-cost gateway.
Therefore, rather than providing large-scale deployment support, IoT
platforms in developing countries need to focus on easy integration of low-
cost “off-the-shelves” components with simple, open programming libraries
and templates for easy appropriation and customisation by third-parties. By
taking an ad-hoc approach, complex mechanisms, such as advanced radio
channel access to overcome the limitations of the low-cost gateway, can even
be integrated as long as they remain transparent to the ﬁnal developers.
10.5.3 Limit Dependency to Proprietary Infrastructures,
Provide Local Interaction Models
Once data are collected on the gateway, they usually have to be
pushed/uploaded to some Internet/cloud servers for storage and visualisation;
and eventually for further processing tasks. It is important in the context
of developing countries to be able to use a wide range of infrastructures
and, if possible, at the lowest cost. Fortunately, along with the global IoT
uptake, there is also a tremendous availability of sophisticated and public IoT
clouds platforms and tools [15], offering an unprecedented level of diversity
Figure 10.2
Several versions of the low-cost gateway (left), close-up view on the PoE version
for easy integration into existing network infrastructures (right).

312
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
which contributes to limit dependency to proprietary infrastructures. Many
of these platforms offer free accounts with limited features but that can
already satisfy the needs of most agriculture/micro and small farm business
models we are referring to when addressing IoT for Sub-Saharan African
applications. What are the impacts on the design architecture/choices of
the deployed IoT platforms? One simple design orientation is to highly
decouple the low-level gateway functionalities from the high-level data post-
processing features, privileging high-level languages for the latter stage (e.g.,
Python) so that customizing data management tasks can be done in a few
minutes, using standard tools, simple RESTAPI interface and available public
clouds.
One additional important issue that needs to be taken into account in
the context of sub-Saharan Africa is the lack or intermittent access to the
Internet. Data should also be locally stored on the gateway which can be
directly used as an end computer by just attaching a keyboard and a display.
This solution perfectly suits low-income countries where many parts can be
found in second markets. The gateway should also be able to interact with
the end-users’smartphone through WiFi or Bluetooth to display captured data
and notify users of important events without the need of Internet access as this
situation can clearly happen in very remote areas.
10.5.4 The H2020 WAZIUP Project
Most of the challenges illustrated in here are planned to be addressed in the
H2020-687607 WAZIUP project. The WAZIUP project, namely the Open
Innovation Platform for IoT-Big Data in Sub-SaharanAfrica is a collaborative
research project using cutting edge technology applying IoT and Big Data
to improve the working conditions in the rural ecosystem of Sub-Saharan
Africa. First, WAZIUP operates by involving farmers and breeders in order to
deﬁne the platform speciﬁcations in focused validation cases. Second, while
tackling challenges which are speciﬁc to the rural ecosystem, it also engages
the ﬂourishing ICT ecosystem in those countries by fostering new tools and
good practices, entrepreneurship and start-ups. Aimed at boosting the ICT
sector, WAZIUP proposes solutions for long term sustainability. See Figure
10.3 for the project’s general technical approach built around the low-cost
gateway and (Future) Internet technologies.
The consortium of WAZIUP involves 7 partners from 4 African countries
and partners from 5 EU countries combining business developers, technol-
ogy experts and local Africa companies operating in agriculture and ICT.
Central to WAZIUP’s concerns is the inclusion of developer communities

(e.g., Coders4Africa) and innovation hubs (e.g., CTIC, iSpace) who have
experience to train, adapt, validate and disseminate results. Quick appropria-
tion and easy customisation by third-parties is ensured by tightly involving
end-users’ communities in the loop, namely rural African communities of
selected pilots, and by frequent training and hackathon sessions organised in
the sub-Saharan African region.
10.6 EU-Japan Collaboration for a World Leading
Research in IoT
The world is facing a number of critical challenges such as global warming,
economic crisis, security threats, inequality, natural disasters and ageing
society. Urban areas are particularly affected, given that the world population
is increasingly concentrated in those areas. Currently more than 75% of the
population in Europe and more than 90% of the population in Japan live in
urban areas2. Further, those areas are expected to absorb the majority of the
population growth expected over the next four decades, while at the same time
drawing in some of the rural population, thus world population in urban areas
is expected to be 66% by 2050.
While occupying 2% of the earth’s surface, cities use 75% of the world
resources. Those resources in civil infrastructure such as water, energy, public
transportation, parking spaces, buildings, roads, bridges, etc., as well as
natural resources and economic resources need to be shared by this increasing
population. This has direct consequences for urban citizens and for the city
itself.
Ranging from social to economic aspects, IoT provides countless pos-
sibilities to enhance the quality of life and security of people, while at the
same time reducing inequalities and providing new revenue opportunities
for enterprising businesses, from large groups and public administrations to
SMEs, start-ups and web entrepreneurs. Considering this potential, European
Commission and two Japanese funding agencies, namely NICT (National
InstituteofInformationandCommunicationTechnologies)andMIC(Ministry
of Internal Affairs and Communication) have launched the ﬁrst joint call for
projects on IoT in 2012 in the context of the FP7 Programme. It is followed
by two other calls in 2014 and in 2015 within the H2020 programme. The
following sections give an overall summary of three projects from those calls,
namely ClouT, FESTIVAL and iKaaS.

10.6.1 ClouT: Cloud of Things for Empowering Citizen ClouT
in Smart Cities
ClouT is a collaborative Europe – Japan project that has developed a smart city
platform which beneﬁts from the latest advances in IoT and Cloud Computing
domains. ClouT, which stands for Cloud of Things, provides a virtualisation
framework to provide a uniform way of representing various city data sources
such as IoT devices, legacy devices, social networks, mobile applications
and World Wide Web. Based on a reference Cloud + IoT architecture and
smart city domain model, ClouT platform has been developed allowing
secure access to real-time data as well as historical data with easy-to use
tools targeting municipalities, citizens, service developers and application
integrators to create, deploy and manage smart city applications. The ClouT
project has been jointly coordinated by CEA and NTT East, and it is further
bringing together prestigious private companies such as ST Microelectronics,
Engineering IngegneriaInformaticaSpA, Panasonic, NTT R&D as well as
academic institutes such as University of Cantabria, Keio University and
National Institute of Informatics, which have strongly committed to bring
this ﬁrst EU-Japan initiative on IoT and cloud to a success.
The project has developed several smart city applications using the
developed platform and tools and deployed them in 4 pilot cities of the
project: Santander, Genova, Fujisawa and Mitaka. Applications e.g., envi-
ronmental monitoring, context aware coupons, city dashboards, citizen safety
applications, elderly care social networks, have been validated via ﬁeld trials
involving real end-users. See in Table 10.2 a few examples.
The project has provided its outcomes in terms of deliverables, reusable
software, fried trial descriptions, newsletters, videos, etc. All the infor-
mation from the project is available at the project website: http://clout-
project.eu.
10.6.2 FESTIVAL Federated Interoperable Smart ICT Services
Development and Testing Platform
There have been long years of research work in Europe and Japan on
federation of test beds and more recently on IoT test beds. FESTIVAL aims
at leveraging those test beds by a federation approach where experimenters
can seamlessly perform their experiments taking beneﬁt of various software
and hardware enablers provided both in Europe and in Japan. Facilitating
the access to those test-beds to a large community of experimenters is a key

Fujisawa: Sensorised garbage cars
This application aims to collect atmo-
spheric information by mobile sensor sys-
tem installed on garbage collection cars in
Fujisawa City. Fujisawa municipality can
monitor the location and operational status
of each garbage collection car through the
Control Center application.
Santander: Smiley Coupon
After the successful trial of the Smiley
Coupon in Fujisawa, ClouT replicates it in
the Santander city. The application provides
customized coupons for the citizens and
visitors according to their degree of smile.
Commercial ﬁrms (restaurants, bars, shops,
etc.) participate with a wide range of special
offers.
Mitaka: Sanpoki Stamp rally
The application contributes to the prevention
of isolation of young and elderly people, by
encouraging them to go out and walk through
suggested routes that match their interests. It
allows to post attractive photos about Mitaka
and share information among the citizens.
Genova: “I don’t risk” application
This application informs citizens about good
practicesandgeneralinformationaboutenvi-
ronmental risks and emergency situations
by using environmental data from weather
sensors, hydrometers, webcams, etc. It has
become one of the top mobile applications
of the Genova City with more than 4000
downloads and average rating of about 4/5.

10.6 EU-Japan Collaboration for a World Leading Research in IoT 317
asset to the development of a large and active community of application
developers, necessary to address many challenges faced by European and
Japanese societies.
FESTIVAL is a H2020 European-Japanese collaborative project that aims
to federate heterogeneous IoT test beds, making them interoperable and
building an “Experimentation as a Service” (EaaS) model. FESTIVAL test
beds connect cyber world to the physical world, from large scale deployments
at a city scale, to small platforms in lab environments and dedicated physical
spaces simulating real-life settings. IoT is related to the physical world,
thus real-life conditions are essential to validate the IoT applications. The
involvement of end-users is also of tremendous importance to validate the
qualityofuserexperience.Goingbeyondthetraditionalnatureofexperimental
facilities, related to computational and networking large scale infrastructures,
FESTIVAL test beds have heterogeneous nature and in order to be federated
they have been clustered in four categories: “Open Data” (i.e., open datasets),
“IoT” (i.e., sensors and actuators), “IT” (i.e., computational resources) and
“Living Labs” (i.e., people). Figure 10.4 illustrates the FESTIVAL’s federation
architecture.
Considering that every test bed category provides speciﬁc resources,
the main challenge for FESTIVAL is to develop a platform that can allow
experimenterstoaccessverydifferentassetsinahomogeneousandtransparent
way, supporting them in the phases of the experiments. The architecture aims
at providing the blueprint to be used to build the federated FESTIVALtest bed.
It speciﬁes a common resource data model and a set of uniform APIs that will
be used by the experimenters to build and deploy rapidly and efﬁciently their
experiments.Thanks to the FESTIVAL’s uniformed approach, the experiments
will be portable across several test beds and replicable with minimum effort
of adaptation.
Furthermore, FESTIVAL tools include the possibility to access FIWARE
Generic Enablers allowing to deploy predeﬁned components to address spe-
ciﬁc needs in the experimentation (e.g., data analysis, big data management
etc.). The FESTIVAL platform will be tested on various application domains
across Japan and Europe such as smart city, smart energy, smart building and
smart shopping.

10.6.3 iKaaS – Intelligent Knowledge as a Service
Smart Cities are happening, and while the increasing sensor deployment in
urban public and private spaces provides invaluable data about resources and
services demand, the sheer amount of data that is available in data bases
and data stores or that can be collected through IoT inﬂuences urban life is
staggering. Understanding this data, deriving knowledge from it to improve
service provision as well as usage of resources is of the utmost importance.
And moreover, the lessons that can be learned in one city and the knowledge
derived can be applied to other cities, in other parts of the world.
However, independent of the location, this relies on the participation of
the citizens and they will only be willing to provide personal information
if their own data is secure and is being kept private, both before and after
knowledge has been derived from it. The iKaaS (intelligent Knowledge-as-a-
Service) project brings the essential building blocks for this together; it deﬁnes
a platform that integrates the three concepts of cloud computing – big data
analytics – IoT. iKaaS deﬁnes and builds a secure data storage and privacy-
preserving analytics engine over heterogeneous multi-cloud environments
spanning across national borders.
As user participation, and personal data sensed around and about the user,
are at the core of building and operating such a knowledgebase, the iKaaS
platform builds privacy, security and trust into storage, access and analysis
capabilities already “by-design” rather than as an add-on. It implements
technical and organisational measures and procedures in such a way that
the processing will ensure the protection of the rights of the user (citizen).
And this also includes the deﬁnition and implementation of mechanisms
that help ensuring that privacy is preserved even when personal data have
been processed. The iKaaS approach applies privacy-preserving data release
methods that guarantee some anonymisation, the iKaaS approach goes beyond
this and builds empirical models to quantify the risks associated with those
methods, and relates those risks using the notion of “costs of attacks”.
iKaaS brings together cloud computing – big data analytics – IoT to
derive knowledge, the project intends to apply these means to platform
instances in different cities, across different countries and across the bound-
aries of administrations and data regulation. These form clear implementation
challenges, especially over multiple cloud environments in different admin-
istrative domains and a myriad of connected personal computing devices.
The iKaaS platform will cater for applications built atop a knowledgebase to
provide end-user as well as business-to-business or business-to-government
services.

320
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
iKaaS tackles three use cases around the wider topic of personal and public
health, as this implies that citizens’ personal health related data is being used
to derive new knowledge, the requirements to data and privacy protection
are immense. However, at the same time, the knowledge that can be gained
from personal data together with environmental observations (air quality,
weather conditions, etc.) will help the wider community to improve conditions
or prevent individual exposure to potentially harmful conditions/situations.
Based on the existing regulations for the treatment of personal information
among member countries, iKaaS investigates solutions for ﬂexible and privacy
enhanced treatment of cross border data which is transitioned via iKaaS
platform. This includes demarcation points of responsibility of data holders,
data transfers or data receiver’s and remedies if problems occur. Via a
multi stake-holder scheme, iKaaS deﬁnes best practices for privacy and data
protection treatment of cross border data.
Multi-Cloud Architecture: iKaaS designs an open, adaptable and secure
Everything-as-a-Service framework for incorporating optimal service deploy-
ment which includes migration and parallelisation as well as distributed
management of smart objects, associated storage, processing and commu-
nication of data, targeted to enable re-usability of applications across different
domains and platforms as well as Knowledge-as-a-Service.
Knowledge as a Service: iKaaS investigates and develops mechanisms that
facilitate re-use of smart objects as a distributed data processing capability,
across different administrative and business domains. iKaaS also develops
mechanisms to analyse data and derive Knowledge-as-a-Service (KaaS).
Security, Privacy, and Trust: iKaaS designs an open, adaptable and secure
Everything-as-a-Service framework for incorporating optimal service deploy-
ment which includes migration and parallelisation as well as distributed
management of smart objects, associated storage, processing and commu-
nication of data, targeted to enable re-usability of applications across different
domains and platforms as well as Knowledge as a Service.
To reach its aims and implement the iKaaS platform, the project team
requires expertise and partners from various domains. The consortium is
coordinated by the University of Surrey and KDDI R&D Labs and consists,
altogether, of six partners from Japan and nine partners from European
Countries, their skillset and expertise are complementarity in the speciﬁed
iKaaS problem domains. iKaaS demonstrates their use cases in Sendai, Japan
(i.e., the town of Tago-Nishi) as well as in Madrid, Spain. (www.ikaas.com).

10.7 EU-US IoT Cooperation
Today there are two main initiatives for the IoT created at global level and
organised as alliances/consortia: the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and
theAlliancefortheIoTInnovation(AIOTI).BoththeseIoTalliances/consortia
create unique value with their organizational entities, by engagement, by
stimulating and matchmaking relationships between companies creating new
applications, increasing revenue, industry reach and shared knowledge and
experience, and support for a long-term value-creating, collaborative relation-
ship, leading to success for the partners involved as well as for the eco-system
as a whole.
IIC, founded by AT&T, Cisco, GE, IBM, and Intel, brings together the
organizations and technologies necessary to accelerate the growth of the
Industrial Internet by identifying, assembling and promoting best practices.

These groups are comprised of Industrial Internet Consortium member com-
pany representatives. Member companies can assign an unlimited number

322
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
of individuals to the Working Groups, which follows the one vote, one
company rule.
The Alliance for IoT Innovation, AIOTI, was initiated following the
European and global IoT technology and market developments and aims to
create and master sustainable innovative European IoT ecosystems in the
global context to address the challenges of IoT technology and applications
deployment including standardisation, interoperability and policy issues, in
order to accelerate sustainable economic development and growth in the new
emerging European and global digital markets.
The AIOTI mission statement covers the following points:
• Develop IoT ecosystems across vertical silos including start-ups and
SMEs

adoption. There are currently 13 Working Groups, broken into 4 horizontal
groups and 9 vertical groups:
• IoT European Research Cluster (IERC)
• Innovation Ecosystems
• IoT Standardisation
• Policy issues
• Smart living environment for ageing well
• Smart farming and food security
• Wearables
• Smart cities
• Smart mobility
• Smart environment (smart water management)
• Smart manufacturing
• Smart energy
• Smart Buildings and Architecture
In this context, the cooperation between EU and US is very important. The
mechanism of cooperation are installed on two levels: governmental level and
project level, preferably on a larger scale. Policies should be investigated on
both sides and provide input for the yearly EU-US ICT Dialogue. In addition,
a wider scope of beneﬁciaries shall be considered including IoT Large Scale
Pilots and IoT Test beds.
In this context there are a number of European projects and initiatives
[18–21] that are addressing the EU-US cooperation and collaboration.
PICASSO project created the framework to bring together experts in the
ﬁeld of 5G, Big Data, IoT, CPS to focus on identifying the key issues in
each speciﬁc ﬁeld and on policy issues that touch upon all of these domains.
The ICT Policy Expert group will focus on Privacy and Data Protection, in
recognition that policy issues relating to this touch all ICT developments
across the Atlantic. UNIFY-IoT project as part of the European Platforms
Initiative (IoT-EPI) is leading the task force on international cooperation in
order to deﬁne the strategy and activities for international collaboration with
global players working at initiatives and projects in the IoT domain. The task
force is coordinating the activities to be planned and executed for liaising,
interacting and then follow-up with the relevant projects’ stakeholders and
IoT ecosystems. The group is coordinating the interaction with international
initiatives by supporting the IoT ecosystems to meet global challenges and to
be adopted worldwide in order to be successful. The intent is to get a clear
overview of the priority policy issues in ICT collaboration, and insights in how

324
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
these issues can be addressed from a bilateral multi stakeholder perspective
in a global context.
In the context of establishing liaisons with key stakeholders outside the
EU the cooperation and meeting with the US stakeholders offer the possibility
to present a panorama of the ICT and IoT landscape and programmes currently
underway in Europe and the US as well as programmes in the rest of the world.
Existing funding opportunities for collaboration are highlighted. The views of
the EU-US Expert Groups on 5G Networks, Big Data, IoT, CPS are presented
identifying gaps and opportunities, a map of challenges, open problems, and
the needs for supporting policy measures and strategic EU-US initiatives (both
policy and research related). Key actors, i.e., NIST, NSF, IMS, are involved
together with the European projects and representatives from EC to highlight
existing opportunities for collaboration.
10.7.1 Policy Level Cooperation
The IoT policy issues is addressed in Europe by 2014 European Commission’s
Article 29Working Party on Data Protection [16] setting forth its interpretation
of how EU data protection laws apply to IoT and in US by the 2015 Report
on the IoT, from FTC [17] setting forth privacy and security best practices
for IoT.
The WP 29 Report looks at IoT via EU data protection principles,
highlighting these concerns for IoT manufacturers, developers and data
collectors:
• Lack of control – Interconnectivity means a greater potential for auto-
matic ﬂow of data among devices (and vendors) without notice to
users.
• Additional purposes – Interconnectivity also may lead to use of gathered
data by third parties for other than the original intent.
• Consent – Because users lack full disclosure of data ﬂow, their consent
to initial data collection may be inadequate.
• Proﬁling – Fine-grained user monitoring and proﬁling could result from
the type of information collectable from connected devices.
• Limiting anonymity – More use of connected devices suggests lower
likelihood for maintaining anonymity.
• Security – Large volumes of data transferring over connected devices
may lead to considerable security risks.
The WP 29 Report recommendations are the security and privacy concerns
and recommends that IoT manufacturers, developers and data collectors:

10.7 EU-US IoT Cooperation
325
• Conduct a privacy impact assessment before releasing a device.
• Delete raw data from the device as soon as it has been extracted.
• Follow privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default principles.
• In a user-friendly way, provide a privacy notice, and obtain consent or
offer the right to refuse.
• Design devices to inform both users and people interacting with them
(e.g., people being recorded by a camera in a wearable technology) of
the data processing by the entity providing the device.
• Inform users of data that has been collected and enable them to access,
review and edit that data before it is transferred.
• Give users granular choices on the type of processing as well as time and
frequency of data gathering.
These principles apply whenever a connected device is used in the EU, even
if the device did not originate in the EU. While the WP 29 Report is not
binding law, it is persuasive to EU regulators, when deciding how to apply
data protection law to the IoT. Once the new EU Data Protection Regulation
takes effect, ﬁnes for violations of EU data protection law could be up to 5
percent of global turnover for a company. Thus, ﬂouting the WP 29 Report
principles, which are considered persuasive authority on the interpretation of
EU data protection law, could result in very signiﬁcant ﬁnes.
The FTC Report focuses on security (considered as harm to consumers
from unauthorized access and misuse of personal information, attacks on other
systems and safety risks) and privacy that are considered as following:
• Remote access to smart meters could enable thieves to determine when
a house is empty, leaving it susceptible to robbery.
• Aconnected device could be used to gain control of a consumer’s internal
network and in turn, attack a third-party system.
• Remote access to stored ﬁnancial data could enable fraud.
• Privacy-related concerns over the collection of sensitive information
(geolocation, ﬁnancial and health data), the sheer volume of data
collected and the potential for misuse.
The FTC Report recommends best practices to IoT manufacturers, developers
and data collectors, focusing on:
• Data security – The FTC recommends that device manufacturers adopt
a privacy-by-design approach, including a privacy and security risk
assessment made prior to release, use of “smart defaults” (e.g., forcing
changes to default device passwords) and security and access control
measures, and monitoring throughout the device’s life cycle.

326
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
• Data minimization –While endorsing the necessity to limit collection and
retention of users’ data, the FTC calls for a “ﬂexible approach,” urging
companies to “develop policies and practices that impose reasonable
limits on the collection and retention of consumer data.”
• Notice and choice –The FTC recognizes notice and choice play a “pivotal
role,” but – in contrast to the WP 29 view – acknowledges that notice
and choice are not always necessary. Instead, the FTC calls for notice
and choice where sensitive data is collected or where there is unexpected
collection or sharing.
The EU-US expert groups, created by a number of European projects and
initiatives [18–21], have identiﬁed different candidate policy issues as input
for further bilateral discussions:
• Addressing global societal challenges, respecting Human Rights, sup-
porting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
• Trust and conﬁdence, privacy and data protection encryption, censorship,
surveillance, security, anonymity,
• Innovation ecosystem, start-ups, incubators, accompanying measures,
• (Open) standards, certiﬁcation, transparency and choice.
These possible policy subjects are provided as a starting point, and are the
baseline for the policy issues to be discussed in dialogue.
Trust and usability are very important success factors for IoT, and IoT
security and privacy need to be addressed across all the IoT architectural
layers and across the domain applications. Performance, complexity, costs are
all factors which inﬂuence adoption in addition to those that engender trust.
While there have been important progress made and actions planned to address
usability there are nevertheless remaining a number of potential gaps in the
overall “trust” framework that can be evaluated.
In this context the EU-US cooperation is seen at company level in
the AIOTI Working Group 04 (WG04), where EU and US companies are
addressing these issues. The AIOTI WG04, is to identify existing or potential
market barriers that prevent the take-up of the IoT in the context of the Digital
Single Market, as well as from an Internal Market perspective, with a particular
focus on trust, security, liability, privacy and net neutrality.
10.7.2 Technical Cooperation
The IIC and AIOTI members could, in the future, maintain a technical
exchange to identify mappings, research priorities, differences and enhance-
ments, support the alignment of IoT architecture efforts for the beneﬁt of

10.7 EU-US IoT Cooperation
327
interoperability of systems from the different domains, map of IoT reference
architectures/platforms showing the direct relationships between elements of
the models and a clear roadmap to ensure future interoperability.
AIOTI and IIC, as the global leading initiative frameworks for the
IoT, create unique value with their organizational entities, by engagement,
by stimulating and matchmaking relationships between companies. This
approach is creating new applications, increasing revenue, industry reach and
shared knowledge and experience, and support for a long-term value-creating,
collaborative relationship, leading to success for the partners involved as well
as for the IoT ecosystem as a whole.
Future EU-US cooperation can be seen in activities addressed in IoT
Large Scale Pilots and IoT Test beds by discussing the main challenges
related to IoT key technologies such as the IoT architectures, scalability and
sustainability of large scale IoT deployments, IoT platforms, semantic and
technical interoperability, thus making full use of the whole digital value chain
and IoT applications and use cases deployed in both regions. In this context,
the development of a common communication strategy that fully exploits
the possible synergies between EU-US initiatives is important for the future
collaboration.
10.7.3 Standards Cooperation
IoT is a global concept, and is based on the idea that anything can be connected
at any time from any place to any network, by preserving the security, privacy
and safety.The concept of connecting any object to the Internet could be one of
the biggest standardization challenges and the success of the IoT is dependent
on the use/development of interoperable global standards.
Globalstandardsareneededtoachieveeconomyofscaleandinterworking.
Interconnected edge devices are evolving to intelligent devices, which need
networking capabilities for a large number of applications and these technolo-
gies are “edge” drivers towards the IoT, while the network identiﬁable devices
will have an impact on telecommunications networks.
Encourage EU-US mutual support and jointly push the development of
international standards for the IoT business layer, in the activities of inter-
national standardisation organisations such as OneM2M, ETSI, CEN/ISO,
IEEE, ITEF and ITU-T. Cooperation foreseen with NIST in the area of Smart
Cities and application of IoT technologies in the cities. The cooperation could
look at the development of performance standards, measurement tools, and
guidance that enable city stakeholders and technology providers to design and
implement effective solutions. The cooperation can address the coordination

328
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
of the development of standards and guidelines for smart city interoperability
and exchange experiences on smart city test beds or IoT large scale pilots.
The EU-US cooperation is coordinated at the company levels in the
AIOTI Working Group 03 (WG03) that address IoT standardisation. The
AIOTI WG03 has provided common views of the IoT stakeholders on the IoT
standardisation that are covered in 3 documents “IoT Landscape and IoT LSP
Standard Framework Concepts”, “IoT High Level Architecture (HLA)”, “IoT
Semantic interoperability”. The documents offer an extensive overview of the
global IoT standardisation landscape allowing the stakeholders involved in
IoTprojects to be ﬂexible and innovative in their use of the information, while
assuring that they provide standard-based and interoperable IoT implementa-
tions. The cooperation EU-US will extend on the alignment of requirements
for standardization bodies to review and inﬂuence global standards.
10.7.4 Market Cooperation
Strengthen EU-US information exchange and cooperation between the tech-
nology innovation strategic alliance of the IoT industry in US like tie IIC
and AIOTI in the EU to establish an effective market supply and demand
platform for European and American companies, which can expand bilateral
industrial research and innovation activities. Many European and American
companies are members of both AIOTI and IIC. The EU-US cooperation at
the level of alliances can support the exchange use cases and architectural
requirements focused on industrial/business/consumer markets in order to
meet the requirements in its speciﬁcation for the different IoT solution imple-
mentations. The EU-US cooperation will focus as well on common support
to accelerate the delivery of a cross sectorial IoT architectural framework
(consumer/industrial/business).
10.8 Conclusions: Cooperation to Balance Globalisation
and Differentiation of IoT Solutions Worldwide
Europe has devoted strong attention to international cooperation with the EU’s
partner countries and regions, developed on the basis of common interest and
mutual beneﬁt and create win-win situations. Many of these activities have
been implemented to the appropriate scale and scope in the context of the
Horizon 2020 framework programme. The IoT, in the large scope of ICT,
has been further developing as a key area of international cooperation aiming
especially at global IoT agreements but also on developing differentiation of
IoT solutions for addressing speciﬁc needs and challenges for both EU and
partner countries and regions.

10.8 Conclusions: Cooperation to Balance Globalisation and Differentiation
329
The South Korean government has established the ‘Mid- and Long-
term R&D plan for IoT’ that links existing R&D projects classiﬁed into
units with the entire ecosystem. South Korea government strongly supports
global collaboration with major countries including the EU. The WISE-IoT
project has started, as part of jointly funded R&D programs, gathering lead
contributors from Europe and South Korea to on-going major global IoT
standardisationactivitieswiththeobjectivetostrengthenandexpandemerging
IoT standards and reference implementation using feedback from user-centric
and context-aware pilots. Further cooperation activities are expected in IoT
standardisation and reference architectures but also on promoting the use of
EU methodologies and models in the implementation of large-scale pilots in
South Korea, especially in smart cities and healthcare application areas.
In China, the IoT has become an important carrier for strategic information
industries and integrated innovation. The EU-China IoT Advisory Group,
established in February 2011, is active on pushing global IoT standards while
developing competitive IoT solutions. An EU-China joint white paper on IoT,
published in January 2016, has laid down the areas of cooperation. Main
ones include: (i) Policy level cooperation to encourage and actively promote
research and innovation cooperation, and publication of results; (ii) Technical
cooperation carrying out twinning activities between EU IoT Large Scale
Pilots and China Megaprojects and enterprise-level cooperation in strategic
sectors on key product development; (iii) Standards cooperation for EU-China
mutual support and jointly push the development of international standards;
and (iv) Market cooperation to strengthen EU-China information exchange
and cooperation between the technology innovation strategic alliance of the
IoT industry in China and Alliance for IoT Innovation in the EU.
EU-Brazil research cooperation in the area of ICT is regarded as having
a crucial strategic value and high societal impact. It has been developing
since the launch of the 1stcoordinated call, back in 2011, to include a
speciﬁc focus on IoT Pilots, in the context of the 4th coordinated joint
call. Furthermore, Europe is supporting Brazil in the context of the secto-
rial dialogues for cybernetic policy on the development of the M2M/IoT
ecosystem by performing an EU-Brazil mapping and comparative study.And,
the EU-Brazil FUTEBOL project is working to create of a federated control
framework to integrate test beds from Europe and Brazil to support network
researchers from academia/industry looking out for the IoT and M2M future
needs. The strategic cooperation of EU with Brazil is expected to be further
supported and animated by the IoT Focus Area CSA project (to be awarded)
on realisation of joint cooperation activities for active knowledge sharing

330
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
and promotion of EU and Brazilian IoT ecosystems/technologies and the
alignment of EU LSP and IoT pilots to be launched as part of the EU-Brazil
research cooperation.
InrespecttoAfrica,theopportunityforIoTapplicationsishugebutAfrican
countries are still far from being ready to enjoy the smallest beneﬁt of IoT due
to the lack of infrastructure, high cost of hardware, complexity in deployment,
lack of technological eco-system and background, etc. As such, and when
deploying IoT in African countries, it is necessary to address three major bar-
riers: (1) Lower-cost, longer-range communications; (2) Cost of hardware and
services;and(3)Limitdependencytoproprietaryinfrastructures,providelocal
interaction models. Most of these challenges are being practically addressed
by the H2020-687607WAZIUPproject collaborative research project by using
cuttingedgetechnologyapplyingIoTandBigDatatoimprovetheworkingand
living conditions in the rural ecosystem of Sub-Saharan Africa. International
collaboration of EU withAfrican countries, and particularly with SouthAfrica,
will pursue towards IoT approaches and solutions that especially address the
development goals.
Europe and Japan are two leading economies which have the necessary
potential to provide world leading technologies for smarter citizen life. The
report “Digital Economy in Japan and the EU”3 identiﬁes common challenges
between the European and the Japanese economies, including the “scaling
up of smart city projects”. To respond to those challenges and following
the success of the preceding joint calls, European Commission and Japanese
agencies have decided to continue collaboration in the context of the H2020
and launched new joint calls on, not only IoT and smart cities but also on
related topics such as 5G, experimentation test beds, ICT-assisted well-ageing,
cyber-security, etc. The ﬁrst conclusions from the achieved projects conﬁrm
that Europe and Japan can provide a strong and reliable partnership to face
together emerging social, economic and environmental challenges.
The EU-US cooperation will increase in the future in the area of IoT on
several levels, governmental, alliances, companies and projects levels.
European Commission gives a strategic dimension to IoT for the Digital
Single Market (DSM), not only in terms of regulatory challenges but also
with regards to overcome interoperability issues and fragmented standards,
probably one of the most dominant obstacles at the moment with the key
objective to develop, implement and deploya collaborative, responsible and

fully functional IoT. This is inline with the 3 pillars identiﬁed in the IoT Staff
Working Document in order to advance IoT in Europe:
• A single market for the IoT: IoT devices and services (thus including
data) must be able to connect seamlessly and on a plug-and-play basis
anywhere in the European Union (EU), and scale up without hindering
from national borders;
• A context of thriving IoT Ecosystems: new products and services in
selected lead markets such as Industrial IoT, and the existence of
open platforms across vertical silos, helping developers’ communities
to innovate and not causing lock-in situations for users;
• Ahuman-centred IoT: European values must ﬁnd their application for the
IoT to empower citizens rather than machines and corporations, driven
by high privacy and security standards and notably through a “Trusted
IoT” label.
On the other side of the Atlantic, US Congress has introduced the Developing
Innovation and Growing the IoT (DIGIT) Act to facilitate planning and
coordination among government and private entities to support expanded use
of the IoT.
The initiative considers that advances in technology could mean using the
IoT to create life-improving developments for everything from health care
to transportation to energy management to smart cities. The strategy aims to
incentivise the development of the IoT, prioritise accelerating IoT’s develop-
ment and deployment and ensure it responsibly protects against misuse.
The DIGIT Act forms a working group consisting of businesses, non-
governmental stakeholders, and federal agencies that would issue guidance
on potential regulatory barriers, current and future spectrum needs, and
possible security concerns. The resolution underscores the US’s commitment
to nurturing innovation, but also in protecting consumers and ﬁnding solutions
to societal challenges through technology driven solutions like IoT.
The strong focus in both regions on implementing a strategy on IoT offers
many opportunities for collaboration and cooperation in the years to come.
Additionalinternationalcooperationpartnershipsareexpectedwithfurther
partner countries or regions. In particular, cooperation with India is highly
anticipated. India has created its vision “to develop connected and smart IoT
based system for our country’s economy, society, environment and global
needs” and is rolling out its IoT action plan. The Indian IoT policy com-
prises of ﬁve vertical pillars (Demonstration Centres, Capacity Building and
Incubation, R&D and Innovation, Incentives and Engagements, Human

332
European IoT International Cooperation in Research and Innovation
Resource Development) and 2 horizontal supports (Standards and Governance
structure). International cooperation is anticipated in several areas of the
IoT policy programme. For instance, in human Resources Development, it
is called for bilateral cooperation programs between Indian premier institutes
and institutes of other countries. Europeis expected to approach authorities and
academic/research institutes in India to explore synergies and collaborations
for global solutions but also local exploitation.

This book provides an overview of the current Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, ranging from 
research, innovation and development priorities to enabling technologies in a global context.
A successful deployment of IoT technologies requires integration of all layers, be they 
cognitive and semantic aspects, middleware components, services, edge devices/machines 
or infrastructures.
This is intended to be a standalone book in a series that covers the IoT activities of the IERC 
(Internet of Things European Research Cluster), from research to technological innovation, 
validation and deployment.
The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European Research Cluster and the IoT 
European Platforms Initiative (IoT-EPI) and presents global views and state of the art findings 
on the challenges facing the research, innovation, development and deployment of IoT in 
forthcoming years.
The IoT is bridging the physical, digital, cyber and virtual worlds and requires sound 
information processing capabilities for the “digital, cyber and virtual shadows” of these real 
things. Research and innovation in nanoelectronics, semiconductors, sensors/actuators, 
communication, analytics technologies, cyber-physical systems, software, swarm intelligence 
and deep learning systems are essential for the successful deployment of IoT applications. 
The emergence of IoT platforms with multiple functionalities enables rapid development and 
lower costs by offering standardized components that can be shared across multiple solutions 
in many industry verticals.
IoT applications will gradually move from vertical, single purpose solutions to multi-
purpose and collaborative applications interacting across industry verticals, organisations 
and people, which is one of the essential paradigms of the digital economy. Many of those 
applications still have to be identified and involvement of end-users, including the creative 
sector, in this innovation is crucial.
IoT applications and deployments as integrated building blocks of the new digital 
economy are part of the accompanying IoT policy framework, which exists to address 
issues of a horizontal nature and common interest (i.e., privacy, end-to-end security, user 
acceptance, societal and ethical aspects, and legal issues) for providing trusted IoT solutions 
in a coordinated and consolidated manner across IoT activities and pilots.
In this context, IoT ecosystems offer solutions beyond a platform and solve important 
technical challenges in the different verticals and across verticals. These IoT technology 
ecosystems are instrumental for the deployment of large pilots and can easily be connected 
to or build upon the core IoT solutions for different applications in order to expand the system 
of use and allow new and even unanticipated IoT end uses.
