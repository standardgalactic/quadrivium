Introduction
Your Canon EOS 7D is the latest and greatest digital camera on the 
market with a stunning 18-megapixel capture, Live View, high-definition 
video, and much more. But all this technology can be a bit daunting, espe-
cially if this is your first real digital SLR (single-lens reflex). You no longer 
have modes like Portrait, Sport, Landscape, and so on. You’ve graduated 
to the big leagues. All you have to do is master the power you hold in your 
hands.
I’ve been using Canon digital SLRs since the EOS 10D, and I’ve learned a lot 
about the cameras since then. I also own an EOS 5D MKII, which has a lot of 
the features found on your EOS 7D. My goal is to show you how to become 
one with your camera. I don’t get overly technical in this book even though 
your camera is very technical. I also do my best to keep it lively. So if you 
want to master your EOS 7D, you have the right book in your hands.
About This Book
If you find the buttons and menus on your shiny new EOS 7D a tad intimidat-
ing, this book is for you. In the chapters of this book, I take you from novice 
point-and-shoot photographer to one who can utilize all the bells and whis-
tles your camera offers. You’ll find information about every menu and button 
on your camera as well as when to use them. I also cover what settings to use 
for specific picture-taking situations. I also show you how to use the software 
that ships with your camera.
Foolish Assumptions
Ah yes. Assume. When broken down to its lowest common denominator . . . 
Okay, I won’t go there. But as an author, I have to make some assumptions. 
First and foremost, you should now own, or have on order, a Canon EOS 7D. 
If you own one of those cute little point-and-shoot Canon cameras, good for 
you, but this book won’t help you with that camera. You should also have a 
computer to download your images to. A basic knowledge of photography 
is also helpful. I know, you probably meet all assumptions. But my editor 
assumes I’ll put this section in this part of the book.

Canon EOS 7D For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
To make life easier, this book has several conventions that are used to iden-
tify pertinent information — stuff you should know. So to help you navigate 
this book easily, I use a few style conventions:
 
✓ Terms or words that you might be unfamiliar with in the context of pho-
tography, I have italicized — and I also define these.
 
✓ Web site addresses, or URLs, are shown in a special monofont typeface, 
like this.
 
✓ Numbered steps that you need to follow and characters you need to 
type are set in bold.
 
✓ Margin art is used to identify camera menu icons and camera buttons. 
When you see one of these icons, it shows you what button to push, or 
what menu tab to navigate to.
 
✓ The Canon EOS 7D menu has pretty little icons for each tab, but no text 
to describe what each tab does. I name the tabs to make things easier 
for you, dear reader, and for me and my editor. You’ll find a table with 
tab names in Chapter 2. 
The Long and Winding Road Ahead
I divide this book into four parts with each devoted to a specific aspect of 
your camera. The chapters flow logically from one subject to the next to take 
you from shooting in Full Auto mode to becoming a seasoned photographer 
who knows what mode to choose and what settings to use for taking pictures 
of specific subjects. You can read the book from cover to cover or if you need 
quick information about a specific topic, peruse the Table of Contents or 
Index until you find the desired topic. Most of the sections in this book don’t 
require reading additional material.
The following sections offer a brief overview of each part of the book.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your 
EOS 7D:
 
✓ Chapter 1 introduces you to the camera and shows you how to do some 
basic tasks.
 
✓ Chapter 2 shows you how to take pictures using the two Automatic 
modes. I show you how to go fully automatic and how to use the 
Creative Auto mode.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Chapter 3 shows you how to specify the image format. I show you how 
to choose JPEG and RAW format, discuss different sizes, and offer my 
recommendation for the ideal format.
 
✓ Chapter 4 shows you how to use the LCD monitor for a myriad of 
purposes. I show you how to review your images, use the histogram, 
and more.
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography
In this part of the book, I cut to the chase and show you how to master the 
advanced features of your camera.
 
✓ Chapter 5 shows you how to use Live View mode. I show you how to 
take pictures with Live View, change autofocus modes, and more. I 
also show you how to capture movies with Live View. So you’re live in 
Chapter 5.
 
✓ Chapter 6 shows you how to use the creative shooting modes. In this 
chapter, I also show you how to modify camera exposure, bracket expo-
sure, and more.
 
✓ Chapter 7 shows you how to use the advanced features of your camera. I 
show you how to set ISO, set white balance, and much more. I also show 
you how to use your EOS 7D flash unit wirelessly to trigger off-camera 
Canon Speedlites.
 
✓ Chapter 8 shows you how to use your EOS 7D in specific shooting situ-
ations. I discuss sport photography, wildlife photography, landscape 
photography, and more.
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images
This part of the book shows you how to organize and edit your images with 
Canon’s ZoomBrowser EX and Digital Photo Professional.
 
✓ Chapter 9 introduces you to Canon’s ZoomBrowser EX and Digital Photo 
Professional. I show you how to download and organize your work, plus 
show you how to do some basic editing tasks.
 
✓ Chapter 10 shows you how to print your images from ZoomBrowser EX 
and Canon Digital Photo Professional. I also show you how to make con-
tact sheets in both applications.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The book concludes with two top ten lists, written by yours truly, who hap-
pens to have a gap between his teeth like David Letterman, who happens to 

4
Canon EOS 7D For Dummies 
be famous for his top ten lists. The lists are grouped according to subject 
matter, and a splendid time is guaranteed for all. And tonight Mr. Kite is top-
ping the bill.
 
✓ Chapter 11 shows you how to create a custom menu and register your 
favorite settings. I also show you how to add copyright information to 
the camera and much more.
 
✓ Chapter 12 shows you how to create wallpaper from your images, create 
a screensaver, attach images to e-mail, create a makeshift tripod, and 
more.
Icons and Other Delights
For Dummies books have icons that contain important bits of information. 
You can hopscotch from icon to icon and discover a lot. But when in doubt, 
read the text associated with the icon. In this book, you find the following 
icons:
 
✓ A Tip icon contains information designed to save you time and in some 
instances, your very sanity.
 
✓ This icon warns you about something you should not do; something 
your fearless author has already done and decided it’s not a good thing 
to do again.
 
✓ When you see this icon, it’s the equivalent of a virtual piece of string tied 
around your finger. This is information you want to commit to memory.
 
✓ When you see this icon, it’s for the geeks in the group who like to know 
all manner of technical stuff.
You’ll also find icons in the margin that show you controls on your camera, 
and menu tabs.

 Introduction
Shoot Lots of Pictures and Enjoy!
Your EOS 7D is a digital photography powerhouse; use it and use it often. 
The old adage of “practice makes perfect” does apply though. The only way 
to become a better photographer and master your equipment is to apply 
what you know and shoot as many pictures as you can. While you’re work-
ing your way through this book, keep your camera close at hand. When your 
significant other pokes his or her head into the room, grab your camera and 
start practicing your craft. Take one picture, then another, and another, and 
so on. With practice, you’ll know your camera like the back of your hand. 
You’ll also know which rules of photography and composition work for you 
and you’ll start to develop your own style. For that matter, you’ll probably 
amaze yourself, too.

n this part, I show you the lay of the land and 
familiarize you with the controls of your EOS 
7D. I also show you how to take great pictures 
automatically and show you how to specify image 
size and format. If you’re curious about how to get 
around in the menu, I show you that as well. I also 
show you how to master your LCD monitor. In 
short, this part shows you everything you need to

T
he Canon EOS 7D has all the latest bells and whistles Canon has 
to offer. It’s a technological marvel that enables you to take 
great pictures and capture high-definition (HD) video. The 
camera has a new processor that gives you the ability 
to capture great images in low light and at a blindingly 
fast speed of up to 8 images per second, which is 
ideal for action photography. The camera has an 
improved, highly customizable autofocus system 
that gives you more control over autofocus than 
in the past. And Canon finally offers a camera with 
a viewfinder that shows you 100 percent of what 
the lens captures: What you see is what you get. 
A dual-axis level (the equivalent of a spirit level in 
a tripod) you can display in the viewfinder lets you 
capture pictures with horizon lines that are level. The 
camera also has a built-in flash system that can be used 
to control external Canon Speedlites. Woohoo!!! Smart flash 
technology.
Getting familiar with all this new technology can seem daunting even to a 
seasoned photographer. I was impressed, albeit a tad flummoxed, when I 
saw the first reviews. Even though I’m a seasoned Canon digital single-lens 
reflex (SLR) user — my first digital SLR was the EOS 10D — I still had a bit 
of a learning curve when I first had the camera in hand, chomping at the bit

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
to take some pictures. But it’s my job to get down to brass tacks with new 
technology and show you how to master it. The fact that you’re reading this 
probably means that you want to know how to use all the bells and whistles 
Canon has built into the camera. In this chapter, I familiarize you with the 
controls, the camera lens, the battery, and the memory cards you use to cap-
ture images with the camera.
Getting to Know the Controls
If you’re a longtime Canon user, you know that you can do an awful lot with 
the camera by using external controls, which saves you from poking around 
inside pesky menus. The camera controls are easy to reach and give you 
access to many powerful features. Although you may think it seems like a 
daunting task to know which button does what, after you use the camera 
for a while, you’ll automatically know which control gives you your desired 
result and then reach for it instinctively, without taking your eye from the 
viewfinder. But first, you need to know what each control does. I explain the 
controls you find on the outside of the camera in the upcoming sections.
Exploring the top of your camera
The top of the camera (as shown in Figure 1-1) is where you find the con-
trols you use most when taking pictures. The top of the camera is where 
you change settings like ISO (International Organization for Standards) and 
shutter speed, choose a shooting mode, and press the shutter button to take 
a picture. You can do lots of other things from the top of the camera, which 
in my humble opinion, is the most important real estate on it, with the pos-
sible exception of the lens. I suggest you get to know the controls on the top 
of your camera intimately, like the back of your hand. Many photographers, 
including me, make it a point to memorize where the controls are and access 
them without taking an eye off the viewfinder. Here’s what you find on the 
top of the camera:
 
✓ Shutter button: This button prefocuses the camera and takes a picture. I 
discuss this button in greater detail in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Multi-function button: This button changes the function of a multi-purpose 
button, and is used extensively when specifying which autofocus point or 
zone is used to achieve focus. I show you how and when to use this button 
when related to a specific task.
 
✓ Main dial: This dial changes a setting after you press a button. For 
example, after you press the ISO speed button, you move this dial to 
change the ISO speed setting. I show you how to use this button as it 
relates to a specific task.
 
✓ LCD Panel Illumination button: Press this button when you’re in dim or 
dark conditions and you need to shed a little light on the LCD panel.

more on the ISO speed setting and flash exposure compensation).
 
✓ AF mode/Drive mode button: This button sets the autofocus mode. You 
can choose from three autofocus modes. (I give you the skinny on auto-
focus modes in Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Metering Mode/White Balance button: This button changes the meter-
ing mode or the white balance (see Chapter 7 for more on the metering 
mode and white balance).
 
✓ LCD panel: This panel shows you all the current settings. I show you 
how to read the information in this panel in the section, “Deciphering 
the LCD Panel,” later in this chapter.

12
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
 
✓ Hot shoe: Slide a compatible flash unit (a Canon flash unit is dubbed a 
Speedlite) that’s compatible with this camera into this slot. The contacts 
in the hot shoe communicate between the camera and the flash unit. (I 
discuss flash photography in Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Mode dial: This button determines which shooting mode the camera 
uses to take the picture. (I show you how to use this dial to choose spe-
cific shooting modes in Chapter 6, and in Chapter 8, I show you how to 
choose optimal settings for specific picture-taking situations.)
Exploring the back of the camera
The back of the camera is also an important place. Here you find controls to 
power up your camera, access the camera menu, and much more. The follow-
ing is what you find on the back of your EOS 7D (see Figure 1-2):
 
✓ AF Point Selection/Magnify button: This button changes from multiple 
autofocus points to a single autofocus point (see Chapter 7). You also use 
this button to zoom in on images when reviewing them (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ AE Lock/Index/Reduce button: This button locks exposure to a spe-
cific part of the frame (see Chapter 6). When reviewing images, use 
this button to view multiple thumbnails or to zoom out when viewing a 
single image (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ AF-On button: This button, in certain shooting modes, establishes focus 
(see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Live View/Movie Shooting switch: This switch shoots in Live View 
mode or shoots movies, which I explain in detail in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Start/Stop button: When you switch to movie shooting mode, this 
button starts and stops recording (see Chapter 5).
 
✓ Multi-controller button: Use this button for a myriad of tasks, such 
as changing the autofocus point, selecting an option when using the 
Quick Control menu instead of the camera menu, or switching from one 
camera menu to the next. (I explain this button in detail when it’s associ-
ated with a specific task throughout this book.)
 
✓ Light sensor: Used when shooting in Auto mode to determine metering. 
Be careful not to block this sensor when shooting in Auto mode.
 
✓ Quick Control dial: This button selects a setting or highlights a menu 
item. This dial is used when performing various tasks, and I discuss it 
throughout this book as needed.
 
✓ Set: Press this button to confirm a task, such as erasing an image from 
your card or setting a menu option. I show you how to use this button to 
perform a specific task throughout this book.
 
✓ Access lamp: Flashes when the camera writes data to the inserted 
memory card.

eyesight.
 
✓ Viewfinder/eyepiece: Use the viewfinder to compose your pictures. 
Shooting information, battery status, and the amount of shots that can 
be stored on the memory card is displayed in the viewfinder. The eye-
piece cushions your eye when you press it against the viewfinder and 
creates a seal that prevents ambient light from having an adverse effect 
on the exposure.
 
✓ LCD monitor: Used to display images, movies, camera menus, and the 
Quick Control menu. (I tell you everything you ever wanted to know 
about the monitor in Chapter 4, and in Chapter 5, I show you how to 
use the monitor to compose pictures and movies while shooting in Live 
View mode.)
 
✓ Speaker: Plays audio when you play back movies.
 
✓ Quick Control button: Press this button to display the Quick Control 
menu on the LCD monitor. (I show you how to use the Quick Control 
menu in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Menu button: Press this button to display the last used camera menu on 
the LCD monitor. (I introduce you to the camera menu in Chapter 2 and 
refer to the menu throughout this book.)
 
✓ Picture Style Selection button: This button selects a picture style. 
(I show you how to select a picture style in Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Info button: Press this button to display shooting information on the 
LCD monitor. You can choose from many different information screens. 
(I inform you about the different screens in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Erase button: This button deletes an image. (I show you how to delete 
images in Chapter 4.)
Exploring the front of the camera
The front of your camera (see Figure 1-3) has a couple controls you can use 
and other gizmos that the camera uses. Here you’ll find a couple buttons that 
you use every day and some features you rarely use. The following is on the 
front of your camera:
 
✓ Remote control sensor: Senses the light from an RC-1 or RC-5 remote 
(sold separately) to actuate the shutter.
 
✓ DC coupler cord hole: Plug the cord from the ACK-E6 power adapter 
(sold separately) into this hole to use the camera without a battery.
 
✓ Body cap: Use the body cap to protect the interior of the camera when 
the lens isn’t attached.
 
✓ EF index mount: Align an EF lens with this mark when attaching it to the 
camera (see the section, “Attaching a Lens,” later in this chapter).

EF-S lenses can be used only by a camera with an APS-C (Advanced 
Photo System Type-C) sensor like the one on your EOS 7D.
 
✓ Flash button: Press this button to pop up the camera flash unit. (I show 
you how to use flash on your subjects in Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Lens-release button: Press this button when releasing a lens from the 
camera. I show you how to attach and remove lenses in the sections 
“Attaching a Lens” and “Removing a Lens,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Depth-of-Field Preview button: Press this button to preview the depth of 
field (the amount of the image in front of and behind your subject that’s 
in apparent focus) at the current f-stop.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
Deciphering the LCD Panel
The LCD panel on the top of the camera displays a lot of information, such as 
the shutter speed, aperture, ISO speed setting, and more. Figure 1-4 shows all 
the possible options that can appear on the LCD panel. However, you’ll never 
see this much information when you photograph a picture. I show you the 
type of information you can expect to see on the LCD panel during specific 
picture-taking scenarios I discuss throughout this book. With the LCD panel, 
you can see the current settings for white balance, ISO, metering mode, and 
much more. Here’s a road map for the information you’ll find on the LCD panel:
 
✓ White balance setting: Displays the current white balance setting. 
You view the panel when choosing a white balance option. The icon for 
auto white balance is shown in Figure 1-4. (I discuss how to set white 
balance in Chapter 7.)
Finding the perfect camera bag
Your EOS 7D is a marvelous camera. Canon has 
more lenses than the law allows, and then there 
are other options such as Speedlites, the stuff 
you use to clean your camera, camera bags, 
and so on. Speaking of camera bags, here are 
some tips for finding the perfect one:
 ✓ Get a bag that’s big enough for the gear you 
now own and any additional equipment 
you anticipate buying in the near future.
 ✓ Purchase a bag that’s comfortable. Make 
sure you try the bag on for size in the 
camera store. Place your camera in the bag 
and put it over your shoulder. If the bag isn’t 
comfortable, ask the salesperson to show 
you a different bag. Nothing is worse than 
a chafed neck after a daylong photography 
adventure.
 ✓ Make sure the bag has enough pockets 
for your stuff. The bag should have a place 
where you can pack extra memory cards, 
spare batteries, and other accessories.
 ✓ Make sure the bag is sturdy enough to pro-
tect your gear.
 ✓ Make sure the bag is made so that you can 
get to your gear quickly. Nothing is worse 
than fumbling for a piece of equipment when 
your digital Kodak moment disappears.
 ✓ If you have a lot of gear, consider purchas-
ing a hard-shell case that’s big enough for 
all your equipment and a soft bag for day 
trips.
 ✓ Consider purchasing a customizable 
camera bag. These bags come with remov-
able partitions that are held in place with 
Velcro.
 ✓ If it rains a lot where you live, purchase a 
water-resistant camera bag or one with 
built-in rain cover.
 ✓ Consider purchasing more than one bag. 
I have one bag that has gobs of space for 
when I go on a hike in search of wildlife to 
photograph. The bag has outside pockets 
for water bottles. I also have a bag that’s big 
enough for two small lenses. I use this bag 
when I go on a photo walkabout in search 
of interesting things to photograph.

sation or autoexposure bracketing has been enabled; it’s also used to set 
flash compensation. (See Chapter 6 for more on autoexposure bracketing 
and see Chapter 7 for flash compensation.)
You see examples of different scenarios on the LCD panel throughout this 
book as I discuss various picture-taking situations.
Decoding Viewfinder Information
The viewfinder, or information central as I like to call it, is another place you 
find a plethora of information. In the viewfinder, you see the image as it will 
be captured by your camera (see Figure 1-5). Your EOS 7D has a very smart 
viewfinder that enables you to see 100 percent of what you’ll capture — a first 
for Canon digital SLRs. Use the viewfinder to compose your picture and view 
camera settings while you change them. Figure 1-5 shows all the possible icons 
that can be displayed while taking a picture and displays all the autofocus 
points. You never see this much information displayed while taking a picture. (I 
show you different viewfinder scenarios when I discuss different picture-taking 

19
 Chapter 1: Exploring the Canon EOS 7D
scenarios throughout the book.) When you peer into the viewfinder, you find 
the current shooting settings, icons for battery status, shots remaining, and 
much more. Here’s the info displayed in your viewfinder:

bracketing is being performed (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Flash ready: This icon indicates that the flash has recycled to full power 
and is ready for use (see Chapter 7).
 
✓ Flash exposure lock/FEB in progress: This icon indicates that you’ve 
locked the flash exposure to a specific point in the frame or that flash 
exposure bracketing is being performed (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ High-speed sync: This icon indicates that you’ve changed the Flash 
mode to highspeed sync (see Chapter 7).

20
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
 
✓ Shutter speed: Displays the shutter speed that will be used to take the 
next picture. You can also use this information to manually set the shut-
ter speed when shooting in Shutter Priority mode or Manual mode (see 
Chapter 6).
 
✓ Aperture: Displays the f-stop that will be used to take the next picture. 
You can use this information to manually set the aperture when shoot-
ing in Aperture Priority mode or Manual mode (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Exposure compensation: This icon indicates whether exposure com-
pensation or autoexposure bracketing has been enabled; it is also used 
to set flash compensation. (See Chapter 6 for more on autoexposure 
bracketing and see Chapter 7 for flash compensation.)
 
✓ Highlight tone priority: This icon displays when you enable Highlight 
Tone Priority (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ ISO speed setting: This icon shows the currently selected ISO speed 
setting. You can also use this information when setting the ISO speed

shooting in Continuous mode. If fewer shots are remaining on the card 
than the maximum burst, the shots remaining display.
 
✓ Focus confirmation light: Lights when you achieve focus.
Attaching a Lens
The beauty of a digital SLR is that you can attach lenses with different focal 
lengths to achieve different effects. Your EOS 7D accepts a wide range of lens 
from super wide-angle lenses that capture a wide view angle, to long telephoto 
lenses that capture a narrow view angle and let you fill the frame with objects 
that are far away. Your camera can use EF lenses and EF-S lenses. The latter 
are specially made for cameras, such as the EOS 7D, that have a sensor smaller 
than the size of a frame of 35mm film. To attach a lens to your camera:
 
1. Remove the body cap from the camera.
 
 Twist the cap counterclockwise to remove it. Alternatively, you’ll 
remove the lens currently on the camera with the steps I outline in the 
upcoming “Removing a Lens” section.
 
2. Remove the rear cap from the lens you’re attaching to the camera.
 
 Twist the cap clockwise to remove it.

21
 Chapter 1: Exploring the Canon EOS 7D
 
3. Align the dot on the lens with the mounting dot on the camera body 
(see Figure 1-6).
EF index mount
EF-S index mount 
Figure 1-6: Aligning the lens.
 
 If you’re using an EF lens, the dot on the lens is red and you align it with 
the red dot on the camera body. If you’re using an EF-S lens, the dot on 
the lens is white and you align it with the white dot on the camera body.
 
4. Twist the lens clockwise until it locks into place.
 
 Don’t force the lens. If the lens doesn’t lock into place with a gentle 
twist, you may not have aligned it properly.
Removing a Lens
When you want to use a different lens or store the camera body, remove the 
lens. Removing a lens and attaching another lens can be a bit of a juggling 
act. To remove a lens from your camera:
 
1. Press the lens-release button.
 
 This button unlocks the lens from the camera.
 
2. Twist the lens counterclockwise until it stops and then gently pull the 
lens out of the body (see Figure 1-7).

22
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
 
To minimize the chance of dust 
getting on your sensor, always 
turn off the camera when chang-
ing lenses. If you leave the power 
on, the sensor has a slight charge 
that can attract dust floating in the 
air. Do not change lenses in a dusty 
environment because dust may inad-
vertently blow into your camera. I 
also find it’s a good idea to point the 
camera body down when changing 
lenses. Dust on the sensor shows up 
as little black specks on your images, 
which is not a good thing.
 
Never store the camera without the 
lens or body cap attached because pollutants may accidentally get into the 
camera, harming the delicate mechanical parts, and possibly fouling the sensor.
Using Image Stabilization Lenses
Many Canon and third-party lenses that fit your camera feature image stabi-
lization. Image stabilization is a feature that enables you to shoot at a slower 
shutter speed than you’d normally be able to use and still get a blur-free 
image. The actual number of stops you can gain depends on how steady you 
are when handling the camera. To enable image stabilization:
 
1. Locate the image stabilization 
switch on the side of your lens.
 
 On Canon lenses, you’ll find the 
switch on the left side of the 
lens when the camera is pointed 
toward your subject (see Figure 
1-8). If you’re using a third-party 
lens, look for a switch that reads 
IS, or refer to the lens manual.
 
2. Push the switch to On to 
enable image stabilization.
 
 Image stabilization uses the 
camera battery to compensate 
for operator movement. Therefore, a good idea is to shut off this feature 
when you need to conserve battery power and don’t need image stabili-
zation. Note that some lenses have two image stabilization switches: one 
that stabilizes the lens in a horizontal and vertical plane, and another 
switch that stabilizes the lens when you pan to follow a moving object.
Rotate counterclockwise

stabilization.

 Chapter 1: Exploring the Canon EOS 7D
What’s my focal length multiplier?
The sensor on your EOS 7D is smaller than the 
frame size of 35mm film. Therefore the resulting 
image incorporates a smaller area than you’d 
capture with a 35mm film camera or a digital SLR 
with a sensor that’s the same size as a frame of 
35mm film — also known as a full-frame sensor. 
When you use a camera that has a sensor 
smaller than the 35mm film frame size, you can 
zoom in closer with a telephoto than would be 
possible with a camera with a full-frame sensor. 
Imagine looking through a window that’s 4 feet 
× 6 feet. You see a large field of view including 
the sky. If the window is shrunk to 2 feet × 3 
feet, you see less of the scene and sky, which 
is the same thing that happens when you use 
a camera with a sensor smaller than the 35mm 
film frame. Photographers who have previously 
shot film with 35mm cameras like to know how 
their lenses will behave on a camera without 
a full-frame sensor. They find out by multiply-
ing their camera’s focal length multiplier by the 
focal length of the lens. The focal length multi-
plier for your EOD 7D is 1.6. Therefore a 50mm 
lens captures the same field of view as an 80mm 
(50mm × 1.6) lens does on a 35mm film camera 
or full-frame digital SLR. When I suggest a focal 
length, I refer to it as the 35mm equivalent. For 
example, if I specify a telephoto focal length 
that is the 35mm equivalent of 80mm, this is a 
50mm lens on the EOS 7D.

24
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
Using a Zoom Lens
The kit lens that comes with the EOS 7D has a focal length range from 28mm 
(wide angle) to 135mm (telephoto). You can purchase additional Canon 
or third-party zoom lenses from your favorite camera supplier. Zoom 
lenses come in two flavors: twist to zoom, or push/pull to zoom in or out, 
respectively.
To use a zoom lens with a barrel that twists to change focal length:
 
1. Grasp the lens barrel with your fingers.
 
2. Twist the barrel to zoom in or out.
To use a push/pull zoom lens:
 
1. Grasp the lens barrel with your fingers.
 
2. Push the barrel away from the camera to zoom in; pull the barrel 
toward the camera to zoom out.

If you wear glasses, or your vision’s not perfect, you can adjust the view-
finder clarity, which makes it easier to compose your images and focus manu-
ally. After all, if what you see in the 
viewfinder isn’t what you get, you 
won’t be a happy camper. To adjust 
viewfinder clarity:
 
1. Attach a lens to the camera.
 
2. Look into the viewfinder and 
turn the dioptric adjuster knob 
(see Figure 1-9) left or right 
until the autofocus points look 
sharp and clear.
 
 If the knob is hard to turn, 
remove the eyepiece cup.
Modifying Basic Camera Settings
Your camera ships with default settings for the country in which the camera 
was purchased. You also have default settings for the amount of time it 
takes the camera to power off when no picture taking or menu activity has

occurred. You can modify these settings to suit your taste, as I show you in 
the upcoming sections.
Changing the date and time
Chances are your camera isn’t set up for the right date and time when you 
get it. You can easily change this to the proper date and time by using a 
camera menu. Yes, consider this your baptism by fire if you’ve never worked 
with your camera menus before. To change the date and time:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
 The previously used menu 
appears on the LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Press the multi-controller 
button to navigate to the 
Camera Settings 2 tab.
 
 
 The menu with the date and 
time options is displayed on 
your LCD monitor (see the top 
image of Figure 1-10).
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight Date/Time and 
then press the Set button.
 
 The month is highlighted.
 
 
4. Press Set to highlight the 
number.
 
 Arrows appear on the top and 
bottom of the number.
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to change the number and then 
press Set.
 
 The change is applied.
 
6. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the date.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to set the date.
 
8. Continue in this manner to change the year, hour, minute, and sec-
onds to the current time.
 
9. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight OK and then press Set.
 
 Your changes are applied.

Changing the auto power-off time
Your camera powers off automatically after a certain period of nonoperation. 
You can specify a period of time from 1 minute to 30 minutes, or you can dis-
able power-off. However, your camera will automatically power off after 30 
minutes of nonactivity, even if you choose Off. If you choose a power-off time 
that’s of a short duration, you’ll conserve your battery. After your camera 
powers off, press the shutter button and the camera powers on again. To 
change the power-off time:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
 The previously used menu 
appears on the LCD monitor.
 
 
 
2. Press the multi-controller 
button to navigate to the 
Camera Settings 1 tab (chosen 
in Figure 1-11).
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight Auto Power Off 
(see the top image of Figure 
1-11) and then press the Set 
button.
 
 The Auto Power Off options dis-
play (see the bottom image of 
Figure 1-11).
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to select the desired setting 
and then press Set.
 
 The change is applied.
 
I recommend that you choose the 
shortest duration for auto power-off 
that you’re comfortable with. This 
helps conserve battery power. As 
long as the power button is in the On 
position, your camera wakes almost 
instantaneously when you press the shutter button halfway.
 
To restore the camera to its default settings, press the Menu button, and 
then use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera Settings 3 tab, 
choose Clear All Settings, and press Set.

Working with CF Cards
Your camera uses CF (CompactFlash) cards to store the pictures you take. 
A CF card is a mechanical device similar to a hard drive. You insert a new CF 
card when you begin shooting and remove the card when it’s full.
To insert a CF card:
 
1. Open the CF card cover on the right side of the camera as you look 
from the back.
 
 To open the cover, slide it away 
from the camera until it stops 
and then rotate it away from the 
camera.
 
2. Insert the card in the slot.
 
 As shown in Figure 1-12, the 
card label is facing you and 
the end with the small holes is 
facing the camera slot.
 
3. Gently push the card into the 
slot.
 
 Never force a card because you 
may damage the pins in the camera and the card. The card slides easily 
into the camera when aligned properly.
 
4. Close the CF card cover.
 
 You’re ready to shoot up a storm.
When a CF card is full, remove it from the camera and insert a new one. To 
remove a CF Card:
 
1. Open the CF card cover.
 
 To open the cover, slide it away from the camera until it stops and then 
rotate it away from the camera.
 
2. Push the white button toward the rear of the CF card cover.
 
 The CF card pops loose from the pins.
 
3. Gently pull the CF card from the slot.
 
 You’re now ready to insert a new CF card and start shooting.
 
You may be tempted to pick up an 8GB or 16GB card, thinking you can store 
a gazillion images on one card and not worry about running out of room. But 
memory cards are mechanical devices that are subject to failure and will fail 
when you least expect it. If a large card fails, you lose lots of images. I carry a

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
couple 4GB CF cards in my camera bag. Although I hate to lose any images, 
I’d rather lose 4GB worth of images than 8 or 16GB. I advise you to purchase 
smaller memory cards.
Formatting a CF Card
After you download images to your computer and back them up (see Chapter 
9), you format the card so you can use it again. A good idea is to format your 
cards before using them again, even if you didn’t fill them. Doing this ensures 
you’ll have a full card to work with and won’t download duplicate images. To 
format a CF card:
 
1. Insert the card in the camera, as I outline in the preceding section.
 
 
2. Press the Menu button.
 
 
 The last used camera menu displays on the LCD monitor.
 
 
3. Press the multi-controller 
button to navigate to the 
Camera Settings 1 tab.
 
 
4. Turn the Quick Control dial to 
select Format.
 
 The Format option is selected 
(see the top image of Figure 1-13).
 
 
5. Press the Set button.
 
 
 The menu changes to show the 
amount of data on the card and 
displays a warning that all data 
will be lost (see the bottom 
image of Figure 1-13).
 
6. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight OK and press Set.
 
 The card is formatted. After for-
matting, you have a blank card 
that’s ready to capture images 
from the camera.
 
 You can’t undo formatting a 
card. Make sure you’ve down-
loaded all images to your com-
puter before you format a card.
 
7. Press the shutter button halfway to exit the menu and resume taking 
pictures.

Charging Your Camera Battery
When you notice the battery status icon is blinking, it’s time to charge the 
battery. Charge the battery using the charger supplied with the camera. To 
recharge the battery, follow these steps:
 
1. Plug the battery charger into a wall outlet.
 
 If you live in North America, your charger works in a 110 volt outlet. If 
you travel overseas with your camera, make sure you bring a converter. 
If you insert the charger into an outlet with the wrong voltage, you’ll 
ruin it.
 
2. Insert the battery (see 
Figure 1-14).
 
 After you insert the battery, 
three lights may flash. This indi-
cates the battery has less than 
25 percent of a full charge.
 
3. Continue charging the battery 
until the light is green.
 
 The battery has a 100 percent 
charge.
 
4. Leave the battery in the 
charger for another hour to 
top it off.
 
 An extra hour seems to give 
you a bit more life. I learned 
this a long time ago. However, 
do not leave the camera in 
the charger and connected 
to a power outlet 
for more than two 
hours after the bat-
tery achieves a full 
charge because you 
may damage the 
battery.
 
5. Replace the protec-
tive cover over the 
battery (see Figure 
1-15).
Figure 1-14: Charging the battery.
Figure 1-15: Replacing the battery cover.

30
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
Here are a few recommendations for camera batteries:
 
✓ After you charge a battery, replace the cover so you can see blue 
through the battery icon. This signifies that you have a fully charged 
battery under the cover, useful information if you own more than 
one battery.
 
✓ Remove the battery from the camera after you’ve finished shooting 
for the day. The battery loses a bit of its charge if you store it in the 
camera.
 
✓ When replacing the cover over a partially used or fully discharged 
battery, place the cover so that the blue does not show through 
the battery icon. This is your indication that the battery is partially 
discharged.
 
✓ In cold conditions, place the spare battery in your coat pocket. This 
keeps it warm and extends the life of the battery charge.
 
✓ Beware of third-party batteries that fit your EOS 7D. They may not 
be compatible with your camera’s battery information system, which 
means you won’t know how much charge remains in the battery. If 
the battery runs out of charge while the camera is writing data to the 
memory card, you may damage the memory card, the battery, or both. 
Batteries that don’t work with your camera typically come with their 
own charging units.

Your EOS 7D can do some pretty amazing things. 
You have lots of control over the camera to get 
ideal pictures. But if all the control seems a bit daunt-
ing when you’re getting to know your new toy, you 
can let the camera make most of the decisions 
for you. If you’re thinking point and shoot, yup, 
that’s what you get when you let the camera take 
the reins. However, you can still get some great 
pictures with your EOS 7D when you take pictures 
using one of the automatic modes.
If you’re an experienced photographer, breeze 
through this chapter and you can show someone else 
how to get great pictures with your high-tech camera — 
that is, if you can part company with it long enough for some-
one else to use it. In this chapter, I show you how to get the most out 
of your camera’s auto modes. I also show you how to use the Self-Timer 
in case you want to take a self-portrait, and show you how to use the 
on-camera flash automatically.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
One of the exciting features of the EOS 7D is Live View mode, which lets you 
compose your image with the LCD monitor. This mode is available only on 
the latest digital SLRs. In this chapter, I deal exclusively with taking pictures 
through the viewfinder. If you’re chomping at the bit to find out how to shoot 
with Live View, fast-forward to Chapter 5.
Ordering from Your Camera Menu
Some of your picture-taking tasks involve using the camera menu. For exam-
ple, when you format a CF card, you use the menu. You also use the menu to 
specify image size and quality as well as set the parameters for tasks, such as 
automatic exposure bracketing. I give you a brief introduction to the camera 
menu in Chapter 1 when I show you how to format a CF card and change the 
date and time. In this section, I give you a brief overview of the menu system. 
Throughout this book, I show you how to use the menu to perform a specific 
task. To access the camera menu:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last used menu displays.
 
2. Rotate the Mode dial to P (see 
Figure 2-1).
 
 P on the Mode dial stands for 
Programmed Auto Exposure 
mode. When you access the 
menu in one of the creative 
shooting modes (P, Tv, Av, M, 
or B), you have access to all the 
menu items.
 
 
3. Press the multi-controller 
button left or right to access 
the Shooting Settings 1 tab 
on the left (see the left side of 
Figure 2-2).
 
 This tab, which I dub Shooting 
Settings 1, is your first set of 
shooting options. Canon doesn’t give a name to each tab. In Table 2-1 
after these steps, I name all these tabs for easy reference. You also have 
access to many of these menu options when you shoot in Creative Auto 
mode. Certain menu options, such as changing image format, aren’t 
available when taking pictures with the Full Auto mode.
Figure 2-1: You have access to all menu 
options when you shoot in Programmed Auto 
Exposure mode.

 When you access a menu, the first option is selected by default. In this 
case, Quality is selected.
 
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 Your menu display changes to reveal the image quality options (see 
Figure 2-2). Notice the icon to the right of the RAW options. This signi-
fies that you use the Main dial to specify this setting. Notice the icon 
to the right of the JPEG settings. This signifies that you use the Quick 
Control dial to specify this setting.
Figure 2-2: This menu has shooting options.
 
5. After changing a menu option, press Set.
 
 This commits the change and returns you to the previous menu.
 
 
6. To highlight another option in the current menu, rotate the Quick 
Control dial to the desired item.
 
 This highlights the menu option.
 
7. To access the menu option, press Set.
 
 You can now change the menu option. Sometimes you use a combina-
tion of the multi-controller button, the Quick Control dial, and the Main 
dial to make a setting. In most instances, you commit the change by 
pressing Set, although the Menu button is used on some occasions. An 
icon appears on each menu, indicating the button to press to apply the 
change.
 
8. Press the multi-controller button right.
 
 
 This displays the Shooting Settings 2 tab. The amount of tabs you have 
depends on the mode in which you’re shooting. If you followed my 
instructions in Step 2, you see 11 tabs. Throughout the rest of the book, 
I show you how to use options in these tabs to perform various tasks.

Where did all the cute icons go?
If you’ve upgraded from an earlier Canon 
camera, such as the EOS 50D, and have 
explored your EOS 7D’s Mode dial, you may 
wonder where all the cute little icons are. You 
may be thinking that the icon with the mountain, 
the girl with the floppy hat, and so on are pres-
ent on every Canon camera. Not so. You gradu-
ated into the big leagues when you bought this 
camera; it has professional features, and pros 
don’t use cameras with funny icons that des-
ignate shooting modes that, er, rank amateurs 
use. Having said that, your EOS 7D has two 
powerful modes that enable you, or someone 
who doesn’t have a lot of photography experi-
ence, to still get good photos automatically.
Taking Your First Picture
You can easily get great results with your EOS 7D automatically. In Full Auto 
mode, all you have to do is compose the picture, achieve focus, and press the 
shutter button. The camera literally takes care of everything. You don’t have 
to mess with choosing the shutter speed, aperture, ISO setting, or anything 
else for that matter. The camera meters the amount of light coming to the 
camera and makes all the heavy decisions for you.
When you’re shooting in Full Auto mode, the camera chooses the actual 
shutter speed, aperture, and ISO used, which is determined by the amount of 
available light. The camera chooses a shutter speed and aperture to ensure a 
properly exposed image (see the “Understanding Exposure and Focal Length” 
section later in this chapter). When you’re taking pictures in dim lighting or 
at night, the camera will attempt to choose a shutter speed that ensures a 
blur-free image (see the “Shutter speed and image sharpness” sidebar later in 
this chapter). If the shutter speed is too slow, you need to mount the camera 
on a tripod to ensure a blur-free image.
Depending on the lighting conditions, the camera may have to increase the 
ISO setting, which makes the camera more sensitive to light. An ISO setting 
above 800 may result in digital noise in the darker areas of the image. When 
you shoot in Full Auto mode, the camera also determines the aperture, 
which, combined with the focal length of the lens you’re using, determines 
how much of the image is in apparent focus from front to back (see the 
“Understanding Exposure and Focal Length” section of this chapter).

36
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
When you unpacked your camera and started exploring the controls, you 
probably noticed the Mode dial on the top-left side of the camera as you look 
at it from behind — the same position from which you take pictures. The 
default setting for this dial is A, which of course, means Automatic. These 
instructions are generic and don’t assume you’ve bought the camera with the 
kit lens. To take a photograph automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert a memory card, power on the camera, and attach the desired 
lens to the camera.
 
 If you’re not familiar with attaching a lens to the camera, check out 
Chapter 1.
 
2. If you’re using a lens with image stabilization, move the switch to IS.
 
 If you bought the camera kit with the 28–135mm lens, you’ll find this 
switch on the left side of the lens with the camera in front of you.
 
3. Make sure the lens is set to AF (autofocus).
 
 If you’re using a Canon lens, you’ll find a switch labeled AF on the left 
side of the lens when the camera is pointed toward your subject.
 
4. Rotate the Mode dial to the A (Full Auto) setting.
 
 It’s the first setting, the green 
rectangle on the Mode dial (see 
Figure 2-3).
 
5. Look through the viewfinder 
and compose your scene.
 
 When you look through the 
viewfinder, you’ll see a lot of 
black squares, 19 to be exact. 
These are the autofocus points, 
the points your camera uses to 
focus. In Full Auto or Creative 
Auto mode, the focus points are 
selected automatically based 
on the information the camera 
gathers through the lens. In 
essence, the camera looks for 
objects with well-defined edges. 
You can customize the way the autofocus system works to suit your 
style of photography when shooting in one of the creative modes, some-
thing I show you in Chapter 6.
 
 Make sure your subject is under one of the autofocus squares. If you’re 
photographing a person, make sure the person is in the center of the 
frame. You can compose the image so that the person isn’t centered in 
the frame. I show you how to do that in the “Focusing On an Off-Center 
Subject” section later in this chapter.
Figure 2-3: Shooting pictures in Full Auto mode.

37
 Chapter 2: Automatically Capturing Great Photographs
 
6. Press and hold the shutter button halfway.
 
 When your camera achieves 
focus, a green dot appears on 
the right side of the viewfinder. 
If the camera can’t achieve 
focus, the dot flashes. If this 
occurs, switch to manual focus 
(see the “Focusing Manually” 
section later in this chapter). 
The autofocus points that the 
camera uses to focus your sub-
ject are also illuminated (see 
Figure 2-4).
 
 If your subject is moving, after 
the camera achieves focus, it 
automatically switches to another focus mode (AI Servo, which I cover 
in Chapter 7) and keeps your subject in focus. On the LCD panel on top 
of the camera and in the viewfinder, you see the shutter speed, aperture, 
and ISO setting the camera uses for the picture. If the shutter speed 
flashes, the speed is too slow to ensure a blur-free image while hand-
holding the camera. If this is the case, mount your camera on a tripod.
 
7. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The camera takes the picture.
 
 When the camera records data to the memory card, the red light below 
the Quick Control dial illuminates. Do not turn off your camera while 
the light is on. If you do, the image isn’t recorded to the memory card. 
Powering off the camera while the light is illuminated may also damage 
the memory card, the camera, or both.
 
8. Review the image on the LCD monitor.
 
 You can view other information regarding the image on your LCD moni-
tor. You can view exposure information, a histogram, and much more. 
I show you how to display image information on the LCD monitor in 
Chapter 4.
In most situations, you get a beautifully exposed image with Full Auto mode. 
If, however, you’re photographing a scene with tricky lighting conditions or 
photographing a fast-moving object, the image may not be to your liking. If 
this is the case, Creative Auto mode gives you options for modifying the auto-
matic settings to get an image that suits your taste. I show you how to use 
Creative Auto mode in the “Shooting Pictures in Creative Auto Mode” section 
later in this chapter. Or maybe now that you’ve had a taste of the camera’s 
brilliance, you want to get the most out of your camera. If this is the case, 
fast-forward to Chapters 6 and 7.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
Understanding Exposure and Focal Length
When you take a picture in any of the 
automatic modes, the camera deter-
mines the shutter speed and aperture 
(see Figure 2-5). The shutter speed 
is the amount of time the shutter 
remains open. When you use a fast 
shutter speed, the shutter is open for 
a short amount of time, which stops 
action. A slow shutter speed keeps 
the shutter open for a long time and 
is needed when you don’t have a lot 
of available light. The aperture deter-
mines how much light enters the 
camera. Each aperture equates to an 
f-stop number. 
The f-stop number is a value. A 
small f-stop number, such as f/2.8, 
designates a large aperture, which 
lets a lot of light into the camera. A 
large f-stop number, such as f/16, 
is a small aperture that lets a small 
amount of light into the camera. 
Figure 2-6 shows a comparison of 
apertures and the amount of light 
they send to the camera.
The f-stop determines another 
important factor, the depth of field. 
The depth of field is the amount of 
the image that’s in apparent focus in 
front of and behind your subject:
 
✓ Small depth of field: A large aperture (small f-stop number) gives you 
a shallow depth of field, especially when you’re shooting the image 
with a telephoto lens. A telephoto lens has a narrow angle of view, 
which gets you closer to your subject and results in an even shallower 
depth of field. Telephoto focal lenses are the 35mm equivalent of 
70mm and greater. Large apertures and telephoto lenses are ideal for 
portrait photography.
 
✓ Large depth of field: On the other hand, a small aperture (large f-stop 
number) gives you a very large depth of field, especially when you’re 
using a wide-angle focal length. A wide-angle focal length has a large 
angle of view. Wide-angle focal lengths have a range that is the 35mm 
equivalent of 18mm to 35mm.

 Chapter 2: Automatically Capturing Great Photographs
As you can see, a large number of factors determine what your image will 
look like.
The following list explains what action the camera takes when you take pic-
tures in various modes:
 
✓ Full Auto mode: The camera determines the shutter speed and f-stop.
 
✓ Creative Auto mode: You can apply some settings to blur the back-
ground, which in essence, gives you a shallower depth of field, brightens 
the image, and so on.
 
✓ Creative modes: These include P (Programmed Auto Exposure), Av 
(Aperture Priority), Tv (Shutter Priority), M (Manual), or B (Bulb). 
Choosing a creative mode enables you to take complete control by man-
ually setting aperture and/or shutter speed.
 
✓ Aperture Priority mode: You supply the aperture (f-stop value), and 
the camera calculates the shutter speed needed for a properly exposed 
image.
 
✓ Shutter Priority mode: You supply the shutter speed, and the camera 
provides the aperture (f-stop value) to create a properly exposed image.
Shutter speed and image sharpness
When you take a picture with the camera cra-
dled in your hands, a certain amount of motion 
is transmitted to the camera, which is caused by 
movement made by the camera operator. When 
you take pictures with a high shutter speed, the 
shutter isn’t open long enough for any opera-
tor movement to affect the sharpness of the 
image. However, when you shoot at a slow 
shutter speed, the shutter is open long enough 
for operator movement to be apparent in the 
image, which shows up as an image that isn’t 
tack sharp. The clarity of your images depends 
on how steadily you hold the camera and the 
shutter speed used to capture the image.
The rule of thumb for handheld photography is to 
shoot with a shutter speed that’s the reciprocal 
of the 35mm equivalent of the lens focal length. 
For example, if you’re using a lens with a focal 
length that measures 50mm, the 35mm equiva-
lent for your EOS 7D is 80mm. Therefore, you 
should use a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second 
or faster to get a blur-free image. If the camera 
chooses a slower shutter speed, you need to 
steady the camera with a tripod. If you use a 
lens with image stabilization, you can shoot at a 
slower shutter speed than normal. Even without 
image stabilization, if you hold the camera very 
steady, you may be able to shoot at a slower 
shutter speed than the rule of thumb listed here. 
The best way to find out how steady you are is 
to experiment with different shutter speeds on 
each lens you own. Due to the narrow angle of 
view, you’ll find that operator movement is very 
apparent when you take pictures with telephoto 
lenses.

40
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
The decisions the camera makes regarding shutter speed and aperture are 
determined by lighting conditions. If you’re taking pictures in low-light situ-
ations or at night, the camera may choose a shutter speed that’s too slow to 
ensure a blur-free picture (see the earlier “Shutter speed and image sharp-
ness” sidebar). If this is the case, you have to mount the camera on a tripod to 
ensure a blur-free picture. But if you want complete control over the exposure, 
use one of the creative modes: Programmed Auto Exposure, Aperture Priority, 
Shutter Priority, Manual, or Bulb, which I outline in detail in Chapter 6.
Focusing On an Off-center Subject
There are lots of rules for composing photographs, and many of them can 
be broken. However, one useful rule says that when you’re photographing a 
person, she shouldn’t be in the center of the frame. A photograph with your 
subject to the right or left of center is more interesting than one where she’s 
smack-dab in the center of the frame. You can easily focus on an off-center 
subject by following these steps:
 
1. Compose your scene through the viewfinder.
 
 Move the camera until you achieve the desired composition.
 
2. Move the camera until the center autofocus point is positioned in the 
middle of your subject.
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 When the camera achieves focus, the green dot on the right side of the 
viewfinder appears. If the dot is flashing, the camera hasn’t focused on 
your subject.
 
4. With the shutter button held down halfway, move the camera to 
recompose your picture.
 
 By holding down the shutter button halfway, the focus locks on your 
subject, even as you move the camera.
 
5. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The camera records the image.
Focusing Manually
You can have the greatest camera and lens in the world, but if your images 
aren’t in focus, nobody — including you — will care to look at your pictures. 
Your EOS 7D has a sophisticated multi-point focus system. In Chapter 7, I 
show you how to modify the autofocus system to suit particular photography 
situations.

41
 Chapter 2: Automatically Capturing Great Photographs
When you shoot images with the lens set to autofocus (AF on Canon lenses) 
mode, the camera looks for areas of changing contrast (edges) or objects that 
are under autofocus points, and then uses these areas to focus the scene. 
However, in low light or when you’re taking a picture of a scene with lots 
of detail in the foreground and background, the camera may not be able to 
achieve focus. The green focus indicator light in the viewfinder flashes when 
you achieve focus, and you may also notice the autofocus motor on the lens 
is quite active as the camera tries to achieve focus. When you can’t achieve 
focus, you have no choice but to manually focus the lens. Canon lenses and 
most third-party lenses give you the option of switching to manual focus.
To manually focus the lens, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the Focus switch to MF (see Figure 2-7).
Figure 2-7: Focusing manually.
 
 On most lenses, you’ll find this switch on the left side when the camera 
is facing your subject.
 
2. Press the viewfinder to your eye and twist the lens focus ring until 
your subject is in clear focus.
 
 Concentrate on areas with contrast or sharp lines. This makes it easier 
for you to see when your subject is in focus. Remember to focus on the 
center of interest in your scene. If you’re photographing a person, focus 
on the eyes. The curve of your subject’s eyelid should be in focus in the 
resulting image; it’s also an easy area to focus on.
 
3. Take the picture.
 
 Switch the lens back to autofocus (AF) when lighting conditions permit 
the camera to focus automatically.

Shooting Pictures in Creative Auto Mode
If you like having control but you’re not ready to walk on the wild side and 
shoot in one of the creative modes, Creative Auto mode is right up your alley. 
When you take pictures in Creative Auto mode, you can control depth of field 
(the amount of the image in front of and behind your subject that’s in appar-
ent focus), image brightness, picture style, image format, and shooting mode. 
When you shoot in Creative Auto mode, all your options display on the cam-
era’s LCD monitor. To shoot pictures in Creative Auto mode:
 
1. Select CA from the Mode dial 
(see Figure 2-8).
 
 CA on the Mode dial stands 
for Creative Auto mode. After 
switching to Creative Auto 
mode, the camera LCD displays 
your options.
 
 
2. Press the Quick Control button.
 
 This button gives you access 
to the first set of options: Flash 
Firings (see Figure 2-9).
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to choose the desired option.
 
 Choose from the following 
options:
 
• Auto Flash: The flash pops 
up and fires when needed.
 
• Flash On: After selecting 
this option, the flash pops 
up when you press the 
shutter button halfway 
and fires when you press 
the shutter button fully. 
This option is handy when 
you want to use flash to fill 
in the shadows.
 
• Flash Off: The flash doesn’t 
fire when the shutter 
button is pressed.
 
 
4. Press the multi-controller button right to highlight the Background 
section (see Figure 2-10).
Figure 2-8: Shooting in Creative Auto mode.

5. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to the right to make the back-
ground sharper or to the left to 
blur it.
 
 As you move the dial, the indi-
cator moves to show how much 
you’ve sharpened or blurred the 
background.
 
6. Press the multi-controller 
button right to highlight 
the Exposure section (see 
Figure 2-11).
 
 When you increase the expo-
sure, you get a brighter image. 
But if you go too far, you may 
blow out highlight areas to pure 
white, which means the image 
is overexposed. If you decrease 
exposure, the image is darker, 
but the resulting image may 
render some shadow areas to 
pure black, which means you’ve 
lost detail in those areas and 
underexposed the image.
 
7. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to the right to make the image 
brighter or to the left to make 
it darker.
 
 As you move the dial, the indica-
tor moves to indicate how much 
you’ve brightened or darkened 
the background. This adjustment 
is only applied to the midtones 
(the middle brightness range), 
which means you can’t overex-
pose or underexpose the image 
with this setting. 
 
8. Press the multi-controller 
button right to highlight the 
Image Effects section (see 
Figure 2-12).

9. Rotate the Quick Control dial to choose one of the following options:
 
• Standard: The default picture style renders an image that is sharp 
and clear. This picture style is ideal for most scenes.
 
• Smooth Skin Tones: This picture style is ideal for shooting portraits. 
The style renders a soft image that’s ideal for close-up portraits of 
women or children.
 
• Vivid Blues and Greens: This picture style is ideally suited for land-
scapes. The style renders extremely sharp and crisp images and as 
the title implies: vivid blues and greens.
 
• Monochrome: This picture style renders a black and white (gray-
scale if you’re a purist) image.
 
10. Press the multi-controller 
button right to highlight the 
Image Recording Quality sec-
tion (see Figure 2-13).
 
11. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to choose the desired image 
size and quality.
 
 I explain the image quality 
and size options in detail in 
Chapter 3.
 
12. Press the multi-controller 
button right to highlight the 
Drive Mode section (see 
Figure 2-14).
 
13. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to choose one of the following 
Drive mode options:
 
• Single Shooting: The 
camera captures a single 
shot each time you press 
the shutter button.
 
• Low Speed Continuous 
Shooting: The camera 
captures images at a maxi-
mum rate of 3 fps (frames 
per second) for as long as 
you hold down the shutter 
button.
 
• 10-Second Countdown Timer: The camera captures the image 10 
seconds after you press the shutter button. You can also capture 
images with the Canon RC-1 or RC-5 remote control.

14. Compose your scene with the viewfinder and then press the shutter 
button halfway.
 
 The green dot on the right side of the viewfinder appears when you 
achieve focus.
 
15. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 The image appears on your LCD monitor almost instantly.
Using the Flash in Auto Modes
Your camera features a built-in flash unit, but it’s no ordinary built-in flash 
unit. This one has the power to command other Canon flash units that sup-
port the EOS series and shed lots of light on your subject. However, when 
you shoot pictures using one of the auto modes, you don’t have access to 
those bells and whistles, which by the way, I cover in Chapter 7.
When you take pictures in Full Auto mode, the flash automatically pops up 
when the camera senses there’s not enough light to properly expose the pic-
ture. Don’t expect miracles from the on-camera flash; it’s effective only for 
a distance of about 16 feet at f/3.5 with an ISO setting of 200. After that the 
on-camera flash falls off so much, it’s not usable. Other issues you’ll find with 
on-camera flash is red-eye when you’re photographing people. The camera 
does have a built in red-eye reduction system.
Using red-eye reduction
When you enable red-eye reduction, the camera fires a preflash that causes 
your subject’s pupils to constrict, thereby reducing red-eye. The effective-
ness of red-eye reduction varies from subject to subject. The alternative is 
using an auxiliary flash that can bounce the flash off a large surface, such as a 
wall, which diffuses the light and doesn’t beam it directly into your subject’s 
eyes. To enable red-eye reduction:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 This displays the last used menu on your LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Press the multi-controller button left or right to navigate to the 
Shooting Settings 1 tab.
 
 These are your first set of shooting settings.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the Red-Eye On/Off option 
(see the left side of Figure 2-15) and then press the Set button.
 
 The Red-Eye On/Off options display (see the right side of Figure 2-15).

46
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
Figure 2-15: Specifying red-eye options.
 
4. Turn the Quick Control dial to highlight On and then press Set.
 
 Red-eye reduction is enabled.
To take a picture when red-eye reduction is enabled: 
 
1. Enable red-eye reduction, as I outline in the preceding steps.
 
 
2. Press the Flash button.
 
 The flash unit pops up.
 
3. Compose your image in the viewfinder.
 
 You’ll get your best results if 
your subject looks directly at 
the red-eye reduction lamp on 
the front of the camera (see 
Figure 2-16).
 
4. Press the shutter button 
halfway.
 
 The red-eye reduction lamp 
lights. When the green light on 
the right side of the viewfinder 
appears, your subject is in 
focus.
 
5. Wait until the exposure com-
pensation display at the bottom 
of the viewfinder disappears.

 Chapter 2: Automatically Capturing Great Photographs
 
 This is your signal that the red-eye reduction lamp is functioning 
optimally. Figure 2-17 shows the disappearing act you’ll see. The 
compensation display disappears on the LCD panel as well. When the 
display disappears completely, the red-eye reduction lamp has done 
its thing.
 
6. After the display disappears, press the shutter button.
 
 In a few seconds, the image displays on the LCD monitor. Review the 
image to make sure no red-eye is visible. If necessary, take the picture 
again.
Figure 2-17: Red-eye reduction is in effect when this icon disappears.
Using flash when shooting in Creative Auto mode
When you take pictures using the Creative Auto mode, you have more flash 
options. You can
 
✓ Have the flash fire automatically when needed: This option works 
identically to when you shoot pictures in Full Auto mode.
 
✓ Disable the flash: If you opt to disable the flash, ambient light is the only 
source of illumination for your pictures.
 
✓ Leave the flash on all the time: If you’re taking pictures of people with 
a strong light source, such as the setting sun behind them, leaving the 
flash up provides light to fill in the shadows, also known as fill light. You 
can also leave the flash up all the time to add a splash of light to your 
images and warm them up.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
To read more about flash photography while shooting in Creative Auto mode, 
check out the “Shooting Pictures in Creative Auto Mode” section earlier in 
this chapter.
Using the Self-Timer
Your camera has a built-in Self-Timer that you use whenever you want to 
delay the opening of the shutter. This option is useful when you want to 
take a self-portrait or you want to be in a picture with other people. The 
Self-Timer is also handy when you’re taking pictures on a tripod, especially 
when the shot requires a long exposure. The countdown allows time for 
any camera shake that was caused by pressing the shutter to subside. Your 
camera has a Self-Timer that counts down from 2 seconds and one that 
counts down from 10 seconds. To enable the Self-Timer:
 
1. Press the AF-Drive button.
 
 
2. Look at the LCD panel and then turn the Quick Control dial to select 
either the 2-Second or 10-Second Timer.
 
 The image on the left of Figure 2-18 shows the LCD panel with the 
2-Second Timer selected, and the image on the right shows the 
10-Second Timer selected.
Figure 2-18: Selecting one of the Self-Timer modes.
 
3. Compose your scene in the viewfinder.
 
 If you’re shooting a self-portrait or will be in the picture, mount your 
camera on a tripod. If you’re not looking through the viewfinder when 
you used the Self-Timer, you’ll also have to remove the eyecup and 
place the eyepiece cover over the viewfinder. This little piece slides into 
the same slots as the eyecup. The eyepiece cover is somewhere in the 
box your camera shipped in. That is unless you realized what the piece 
is used for and put it in your camera bag. The eyepiece cover prevents 
stray light from changing the exposure.

49
 Chapter 2: Automatically Capturing Great Photographs
 
4. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 The green light on the right side of the viewfinder shines when focus has 
been achieved.
 
5. Press the shutter button.
 
 The camera begins to count down. As the camera counts down, you 
hear a beeping sound and a light on the front of the camera flashes. Two 
seconds before the end of the countdown, the light stays on and the 
beeping sounds faster. If you’re taking a self-portrait, say “cheese” when 
the red light is solid.
Triggering the Shutter Remotely
You can trigger the camera shutter remotely using the RC-1 or RC-5 remote 
control, which is sold separately. You use the remote controllers in con-
junction with the timer. This option is handy when you’re creating still-
life photos. Instead of walking between the camera and your subject, you 
can make subtle changes to the composition and then trigger the camera 
remotely. To trigger your camera remotely:
 
1. Mount the camera on a tripod.
 
2. Switch the lens to manual focus and focus on your subject.
 
 For more information on manually focusing the camera, see the 
“Focusing Manually” section earlier in this chapter.
 
3. Press the AF-Drive button.
 
 
4. While looking at the LCD panel, rotate the Quick Control dial to select 
the desired remote mode.
 
 You can trigger the camera remotely and have it count down from 10 
or 2 seconds. The left side of Figure 2-19 shows the LCD panel with 
a 2-second remote, and the right side of the panel shows 10-second 
remote.

5. Compose your scene through the viewfinder and then focus on your 
subject.
 
6. Point the remote controller at the camera’s remote sensor and then 
press the remote’s trigger button.
 
 The remote sensor is located near the handgrip on the left side of the 
camera as you look at it.
 
 The Self-Timer counts down, the shutter actuates, and the picture is

Specifying Image Size and Quality
In This Chapter
▶ Determining image size, format, and quality
▶ Comparing image formats and file sizes
▶ Creating folders and a file-numbering method
Your camera captures images with a resolution of 18 megapixels, which 
is humongous, ginormous, or any other adjective you prefer to indicate 
something that’s big. The good news: This gives you a tremendous amount of 
flexibility. You can print images as large as 21.6 x 14.4 inches. Thinking of the 
possibilities of decorating your house with your photographs? The bad news: 
The large size takes up lots of room on your memory card and lots of room 
on the hard drive that you store your images on. Fortunately, you can specify 
different sizes by using camera menu options if you have memory 
cards and hard drives with small capacities.
In addition to concerning yourself with image size, you 
also have the file format you choose to worry about. 
Your camera can capture images in the RAW or 
JPEG format. When you capture images in the RAW 
format, you must process them. Think digital dark-
room, and you get the idea. The RAW format gives 
you a tremendous amount of flexibility. After you 
download RAW images to your computer, you pro-
cess the images with software included with your 
camera or with third-party software, such as Adobe 
Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop.
If you capture images in the JPEG format, the camera 
does the processing for you. Think of this as the digital 
equivalent of a Polaroid image. You get instant gratification but 
can’t do much with the image except crop it and perform minimal 
image editing. If you capture images in the JPEG format, you also have to 
think about image quality. The setting you choose determines the image qual-
ity and the file size.

52
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
If you’re new to digital photography, file format, image size, and quality may 
seem a tad overwhelming. But hey, don’t worry — be happy. I show you how 
to specify image size, quality, and a whole lot more in this chapter.
Understanding Image Size and Quality
Your camera can capture large images. The default option captures images 
at a size that most photographers — except professionals — won’t ever need 
or use. But before you specify sizes, you need to understand the relation-
ship between the image size and the resolution. The default image size your 
camera can capture measures 5184 x 3456 pixels. If you do the math:
5184 × 3456 = 17915904 pixels
17915904 ÷ 1,000,000 = 17.91.
Round up to get 18 megapixels.
The default resolution for your camera is 240 pixels per inch (ppi). If you do 
a little more math, the default image size and resolution equate to an image 
size of 21.6 x 14.4 inches:
5184 ÷ 240 = 21.6 inches
3456 ÷ 240 = 14.4 inches.
Please don’t try this math at home unless you own a well-lubricated abacus.
Another factor to consider is the final destination of the images. If you’re 
going to edit the images with Canon or third-party software and then print 
them, you need to factor this into the choices you make when specifying 
image size and quality. You can get high-quality prints with the 240 ppi 
default resolution. However, some printers prefer 300 ppi. If you’re capturing 
images that will be displayed on a Web site only, you can get by with a much 
smaller image and a resolution of 72 or 96 ppi. When you use images on the 
Web, you’ll rarely need one with a dimension that’s wider than 640 pixels. 
You can resample images to a higher resolution with third-party software, 
such as Photoshop Elements, Photoshop, or Photoshop Lightroom.
The default image size is great if you’re printing images and have gobs of 
space on your hard drive and a pocket full of 4GB memory cards. However, if 
your storage capacity is at a premium or you’re running out of room on your 
last memory card with no computer readily available to download to, it’s 
important to know how to change image size and quality, a task I show you 
how to do in the upcoming sections.

53
 Chapter 3: Specifying Image Size and Quality
Specifying Image Format, Size, and Quality
Your EOS 7D has many options that determine the dimensions, image format, 
quality, and file size. You can choose from two image formats — JPEG and 
RAW. You have three different sizes for each image format. If you capture 
images with the JPEG format, you can also specify image quality. You can 
capture both formats when you shoot an image, or choose either format. If 
you choose to capture images in one format and decide you want to record 
an image with both formations, your camera features a RAW+JPEG button 
that lets you capture both formats on the fly.
Your decisions regarding format, image size, and quality determine the crisp-
ness of the resulting images, the file size, and the amount of flexibility you 
have when editing your images. To give you an idea of the difference in file 
sizes, you’ll end up with a file size of 6.6MB when you capture an image using 
the JPEG format with Fine quality compared to a file size of approximately 
25MB when you capture an image using the RAW format. I explain the dif-
ferences between the two formats in an upcoming “JPEG or RAW? Which is 
right for you?” sidebar. I also give you my take on which options you should 
choose in the “My recommendations” sidebar later in this chapter. The fol-
lowing sections show you how to choose options from the camera menus.
Choosing the file format, image size, and quality
One of the first decisions you make regarding your images is the file format. 
You can capture JPEG or RAW images. When you choose the file format, you 
also specify the image size. If you choose the JPEG format, you specify the 
quality as well. You even have an option to capture both formats simultane-
ously. If you’re curious about the difference between the formats, check out 
the “JPEG or RAW? Which is right for you?” sidebar in this chapter. To spec-
ify the image format:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 This displays the last used menu on your LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Press the multi-controller button left or right to access the Shooting 
Settings 1 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Quality (see Figure 3-1).
 
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 Your image format, size, and quality options display (see the right side 
of Figure 3-1).

5. Rotate the Main dial to specify a RAW setting.
 
 Choose this option to capture RAW images, or perform this step with 
Step 6 to capture JPEG images simultaneously when you press the shut-
ter button. Your options are RAW (5184 x 3456 pixels), MRAW (3888 x 
2592 pixels), or SRAW (2592 x 1728 pixels). When you select an option, 
the file size, image dimensions in pixels, and the number of images that 
can be captured on your memory card in the camera display in the 
upper-right corner of the Quality menu.
 
6. Rotate the Quick Control dial to specify a JPEG setting.
 
 Choose this option to capture JPEG images, or perform this step with 
Step 5 to capture RAW images simultaneously when you press the shut-
ter button. Your options are Large with Fine, Large with Normal, Medium 
with Fine, Medium with Normal, Small with Fine, or Small with Normal. 
The dimensions, respectively, are 5184 x 3456 pixels, 3888 x 2592 pixels, 
or 2592 x 1728 pixels.
 
7. Press Set to apply the change.
 
 The selected image information displays next to Quality on the Shooting 
Settings 1 tab.
Using One Touch RAW+JPEG
Many photographers capture JPEG and RAW photographs simultaneously. 
With this option, you have images that are processed and ready for viewing 
(the JPEG file), and an image that can be tweaked to perfection with Canon 
or third-party software (the RAW file). However, capturing images in two for-
mats takes up a lot of room on your memory card. With your EOS 7D, you can 
capture images in the JPEG or RAW formats, as well as capture both formats 

55
 Chapter 3: Specifying Image Size and Quality
simultaneously when you need to. After you configure the RAW+JPEG button 
using menu commands, you can capture both formats with the press of a 
button.
To configure how the RAW+JPEG button records images when you press it:
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last menu you used displays on your LCD monitor.
 
2. Press the multi-controller button left or right to access the Shooting

button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 The green dot on the right side of the viewfinder glows solid when you 
achieve focus.
 
3. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The camera simultaneously captures a RAW and JPEG image. The button 
works only for one shot. To capture RAW and JPEG images simultane-
ously again, press the RAW+JPEG button.

57
 Chapter 3: Specifying Image Size and Quality
Comparing Image Formats and File Sizes
When you capture images with a higher resolution, the file size is bigger and 
they take up more room on your memory card. The image format also enters 
into the equation, and if you choose to capture images with the JPEG format, 
the image quality is a factor. Photographers also like to know the maximum 
number of images they can capture when shooting in Continuous (Burst) 
mode. The number of images depends on the image dimensions and qual-
ity, which equates to the file size. When you capture smaller images in the 
JPEG format that have been compressed, the file size is smaller; therefore, 
the maximum number of images you can capture before the card is filled is 
greater. Table 3-1 shows you how many images you can fit on a 4GB card for 
each available format and quality option. The information is based on captur-
ing images with an ISO speed setting of 100. This table is only for reference. 
Your results will differ based on the subject and ISO speed setting.

JPEG or RAW? Which is right for you?
The answer to those questions depends on how 
serious you are about your photography. Before 
you decide, let me point out the differences 
between the two formats. When you capture 
an image in the JPEG format, the camera pro-
cesses the image. The camera also compresses 
the image based on the quality option you spec-
ify in the camera menu. You can store more 
images on a card when you specify a smaller 
image size and quality. However, you’ll notice 
the difference when you print your images. 
When you choose the RAW format, you have 
the ultimate in flexibility. The camera sensor 
transmits the RAW data to your memory card. 
Yup. What the sensor captures is what you get. 
You do have to process RAW images with either 
the Canon software provided with your camera 
or with third-party software such as Photoshop 
Elements, Photoshop, or Photoshop Lightroom. 
The software lets you fine-tune virtually every-
thing about the photo.

My recommendations
When I take a photograph, I think of all pos-
sible uses. My first option is to post an image 
I like to my blog. Eventually I’ll make prints of 
my best images. Some of those prints may be 
4 x 6 inches for a small album, or I may have 
the image printed on a 30-x-20-inch canvas to 
decorate my home. Therefore, I always capture 
images with the RAW option. This enables me 
to do anything I want with the image. Yes, they 
take up a lot of room, but memory cards and 
hard drives are fairly inexpensive. My second 
hard drive is 1TB (terabyte), and I store only 
images on it.
Sometimes I photograph events that require 
me to produce images quickly, yet I still want 
to edit them to perfection at some point in time. 
When I run into a scenario like this, I capture 
RAW and JPEG images simultaneously. If the 
images that need to be turned around quickly 
are for the Web, I use the Small JPEG option 
with Normal quality in addition to the RAW set-
ting. If the images will be printed, say for exam-
ple in a local newspaper or magazine, I use the 
Large JPEG option with Fine quality and capture 
RAW images simultaneously. Both options 
enable me to give the client a JPEG image 
almost immediately and then edit RAW images 
for other outputs at a later date.
I also have the One Touch RAW+JPEG button 
configured to capture Large JPEG images with 
Fine quality and full-size RAW images. I still 
shoot with the RAW format, but when I run 
across a scene that I want to see the light of day 
quickly in JPEG format, I press the RAW+JPEG 
button.
If you photograph an event, such as a wedding, 
you have other options. In this case, I recom-
mend that you use the RAW format for all the 
standard wedding images, such as exchang-
ing vows and rings, marching down the aisle, 
and so on. I also recommend you use RAW 
when shooting the formal shots of the family 
members with the bride and groom. However, 
when you’re photographing the reception, use 
RAW for the first dances, and then switch to 
MRAW or SRAW for the candid shots of the 
couples at tables and the guests dancing. 
These photographs are generally ordered as 
4-x-6-inch images. Therefore, you don’t need 
a full 18-megapixel capture for a high-quality 
print. Switching to SRAW or MRAW for the less 
important shots conserves room on your card.

59
 Chapter 3: Specifying Image Size and Quality
If you prefer to capture your images in the JPEG format, the quality you 
choose determines what the final image looks like. If you compare the Normal 
quality to the Fine quality, you’ll notice a difference when you print the image 
at the largest size possible. The Normal quality image won’t be as crisp and 
sharp as the Fine quality image. On the left side of Figure 3-4 is an enlarge-
ment of an image captured with the JPEG Fine quality. The image on the right 
side of Figure 3-4 was captured with the JPEG Normal quality. The images 
have been magnified so you can more clearly see the difference in sharpness 
and detail.
Figure 3-4: Comparing the JPEG Normal and Fine qualities.
Managing Image Files
By default, your images are numbered continuously until 9999 and then the 
file number is reset to 0001. Your images are also stored in a single folder on 
your memory card. You can, however, create folders in which to store your 
images and then change the file-numbering method. I show you how in the 
following sections.
Creating folders
By default, your camera creates the 100EOS7D folder on your memory card 
where images are stored. You can, however, create as many folders as you 
want. A folder can hold a maximum of 9,999 images. When you exceed the 
maximum allowable images in a folder, a new one is created automatically. 
You can have a maximum of 999 folders on a card. Organizing your work in 
folders is a good idea if you work with large memory cards and want to store 
images from multiple shoots in separate folders. To create a folder:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.

60
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera 
Settings 1 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Select Folder (see the left 
side of Figure 3-5).
 
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 The Select Folder menu appears showing you the current folders on 
the card and the number of photos in each folder (see the right side of 
Figure 3-5).
Figure 3-5: Creating a folder.
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight Create Folder and 
press Set.
 
 The menu refreshes, and a com-
mand to create a folder appears 
with the next available folder 
number (see Figure 3-6).
 
6. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight OK and then press 
Set.
 
 The new folder is created.
Selecting a folder
Folders are convenient when you want to separate images from different 
photo shoots. When you have more than one folder, you can choose the 
folder to store your images. To select a folder:
Figure 3-6: Creating a new folder.

61
 Chapter 3: Specifying Image Size and Quality
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera 
Settings 1 tab.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Select Folder and then press 
the Set button.
 
 The folders you’ve created display.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the desired folder and then 
press Set.
 
 The next images you shoot will be stored in that folder.
Choosing a file-numbering method
Your camera automatically names and numbers each image you take. The 
name isn’t all that descriptive, and the numbers are consecutive. Some 
photographers stay with the default numbering system because it helps 
keep track of the number of shutter actuations. But your EOS 7D is rated 
for 150,000 shutter actuations so that’s a moot point. To change the 
file-numbering system:
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera 
Settings 1 tab.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight File Numbering (see the left 
side of Figure 3-7) and then press the Set button.
 
 A menu appears with your file-numbering options (see the right side of 
Figure 3-7).
Figure 3-7: Selecting a file-numbering option.

62
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight one of the following 
options:
 
• Continuous: Numbers files in sequence, even when you insert a new 
card or store images in a different folder. Images are numbered to 
9999 and then start over at 0001. When you use this option, start 
with a newly formatted card each time. If you use multiple cards 
that already have images on them, you may run into problems with 
duplicate filenames because file numbering may continue from the 
last image captured on the card. Duplicate filenames isn’t a good 
thing if you’re storing all your images in the same folder.
 
• Auto Reset: Numbers the first image with 0001 each time you insert 
the card in the camera or when images are stored in a new folder. 
This option works well if you store images from each shoot in their 
own folder when you download them to your computer, or as I 
strongly suggest, rename the images when you download them to 
your computer.
 
• Manual Reset: Creates a new folder and resets the numbering to 
0001 after you press the Set button. After manually resetting file 
numbering, the numbering system reverts to the last option you 
specified, Continuous or Auto Reset.
 
5. After highlighting the desired option, press Set to commit the change.
 
 The file-numbering option remains in effect until you change it with this 
menu command.

D
igital photography is all about instant gratification. You snap a picture, 
and it appears on your LCD monitor almost instantaneously. This gives 
you a chance to see whether you captured the image. But your LCD monitor 
can do much more than just display your picture. You can get all 
sorts of useful information, such as the shutter speed, aper-
ture, and other pertinent information about the image. You 
can even display a spiffy graph known as a histogram 
that shows the distribution of pixels from shadows to 
highlights.
The information you can display on the camera LCD 
monitor gives you the opportunity to examine each 
image and make sure you got it right in the camera. 
Photographers should always do their best to get it 
right in the camera and rely as little as possible on 
programs like Photoshop to correct exposure prob-
lems and other issues that could have been avoided 
when taking the picture. After all, Photoshop is a noun, 

64
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
not a verb. So instead of taking the picture and saying you’ll Photoshop it, 
rely on the information your camera supplies to determine whether you 
got the exposure right. Programs like Photoshop are designed to enhance 
images, not fix them.
In this chapter, I show you how to use your LCD monitor to review images, 
display image information, and much more. I also show you how to erase, 
rotate, and protect images.
Displaying Image Information
When you take a picture, you see it almost immediately on your LCD moni-
tor. When you want the big picture, you view the image with the exposure 
information. The large image lets you evaluate things like composition and 
image sharpness, which enables you to decide whether the image is worth 
keeping. However, if you can deal with a smaller image, you can view all sorts 
of information about the image that can tell you whether you nailed the shot. 
If you’re shooting in one of the Auto modes, examining this information helps 
you become a better photographer.
Getting camera information on the camera LCD monitor is easy. All you need 
to do is press the Info button. Each time you press the button, the display 
changes to reveal different information. The image size changes depending 
on the information shown.
 
 Each time you press the Info button a different set of information appears, as 
shown in Figure 4-1. The default information shows the shutter speed, aper-
ture, and folder number (in the upper-left corner of Figure 4-1). Press the Info 
button again to add the file format and the image number out of the total 
number of images recorded on the card to date (upper right). Press the Info 
button again to display a histogram with the image, the shooting mode, and 
other information such as the metering mode, the color profile, and the date 
and time (lower left). Press the Info button yet again to display a histogram 
for each color channel (lower right).

Using the Histogram
Even though your EOS 7D is a very capable camera, it can get it wrong when 
you’re shooting under difficult lighting conditions. That’s why your camera 
lets you display a histogram (see Figure 4-2) alongside the image on your 
camera LCD monitor. A histogram is a wonderful thing: It’s a graph — well 
actually it looks more like a mountain — that shows the distribution of pixels 
from shadows to highlights. Study the histogram to decide whether the 
camera — or you, if you manually exposed the image — properly exposed 
the image. The histogram can tell you whether the image was underexposed 

66
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
or overexposed. Notice the sharp 
spike on the right side of the histo-
gram in Figure 4-2. This indicates 
that all detail has been lost in some 
of the highlights. In the case of this 
image, the setting sun was too bright 
for the camera settings, even though 
I used exposure compensation to 
decrease the exposure by one stop. 
Your camera can display a single 
histogram or display a histogram for 
the red, green, and blue channels 
(see Figure 4-3).
A peak in the histogram shows a lot 
of pixels for a brightness level. A 
valley, however, shows fewer pixels 
at that brightness range. Where the 
graph hits the floor of the histogram, 
you have no data for that brightness 
range.
 
When analyzing a histogram, look for 
sharp peaks at either end of the 
scale. If you have a sharp peak on 
the shadow (or left) side of the histo-
gram, the image is underexposed. 
Also, if the graph is on the floor of 
the histogram in the highlight (or 
right) side, the image is underex-
posed. However, if a large spike is 
right up against the highlight (right) side of the histogram, the image is over-
exposed and a lot of the details in the image highlights have been blown out 
to pure white. You can correct for overexposure and underexposure to a 
degree in your image-editing program, but it’s always best to get it right in 
the camera. If you analyze a histogram and notice that the image is overex-
posed or underexposed, you can use your camera’s exposure compensation 
feature to rectify the problem. For more information on exposure compensa-
tion, see Chapter 6.
Figure 4-2: Deciphering a histogram.
Figure 4-3: Displaying a histogram for each 
color channel.

67
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
The histogram is a tool. Use it wisely. When you’re analyzing a scene that 
doesn’t have any bright highlights, you may end up with a histogram that’s 
relatively flat on the right side. When that happens, judge whether the image 
on the camera LCD monitor looks like the actual scene. If you rely on the his-
togram when you see a flat area in the highlights and add exposure compen-
sation, you may make the image brighter than the scene actually was.
Previewing Your Images
In addition to displaying information with your images, you can display mul-
tiple images on the monitor, zoom in to study the image in greater detail, or 
zoom out. This flexibility makes it easier for you to select a single image from 
thumbnails, to study the image up close to make sure the camera focused 
properly, and to ensure that you have a blur-free image.
To preview images on the camera LCD monitor:
 
 
1. Click the Playback button to preview an image.
 
 The last image photographed 
or reviewed displays on the 
monitor (see Figure 4-4). You 
can change the information dis-
played with the image or video 
by pressing the Info button, 
as I outline in the “Displaying 
Image Information” section ear-
lier in this chapter. A movie is 
designated by an old-fashioned 
movie camera icon with the 
duration of the movie shown 
above the icon. For more infor-
mation on playing movies, refer 
to Chapter 5.
 
 
2. Click the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button.
 
 Four thumbnails appear on the LCD monitor (see the left image in 
Figure 4-5). A filmstrip icon appears around a movie when it’s shown 
in thumbnail view.

Figure 4-5: Displaying multiple images as thumbnails.
 
3. Click the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button again.
 
 Nine thumbnails appear on the camera LCD monitor (see the right image 
in Figure 4-5).
 
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to navigate between images.
 
 
5. Press the Set button to fill the monitor with the selected image.
 
 If the image was shot with the camera held vertically, the image doesn’t 
fill the screen unless you enable the menu option to rotate images (see 
the section, “Rotating Images,” later in this chapter).
To modify the view of a single image:
 
1. Click the Playback button to preview an image.
 
 The last image photographed or reviewed displays on the monitor.
 
 
2. Press the AF Point Selection/Magnify button.
 
 The image is magnified. Each 
time you press the button, the 
image zooms to the next highest 
magnification. A white rectangle 
indicates the part of the image 
to which you’ve zoomed (see 
Figure 4-6).
 
 
3. Press the multi-controller 
button to pan to different parts 
of the image.
 
 With this button, you can move 
left, right, up, or down.
Figure 4-6: Zooming in on an image.

69
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
4. Press the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button to zoom out.
 
 Each time you press this button, you zoom out to the next lowest level 
of magnification. Eventually you can zoom out until the image fills 
the monitor. If you press the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button after that, 
thumbnails display.
Modifying Image Review Time
You can modify the amount of time the image displays on the LCD monitor 
after the camera writes it to your memory card. You can set the preview time 
from 2 to 8 seconds or display the image until you turn off the camera. To 
modify the image review time:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
2. Press the multi-controller button right or left to navigate to the 
Shooting Settings 1 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Review Time (see the left 
side of Figure 4-7).
 
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 The Review Time menu appears showing the options for image review 
(see the right side of Figure 4-7). The Hold option displays the image 
until you press the shutter button halfway, navigate to another image, or 
power off the camera.
 
 When you increase image review time, you decrease battery life.
Figure 4-7: Changing image review time.

5. Highlight the desired option and then press Set.
 
 The new review options take effect the next time you take a picture.
Changing Monitor Brightness
Camera LCD monitors have come a long way, baby. The monitor on your EOS 
7D offers a brilliant display with lots of pixels; the better to see images with, 
my dear reader. However at times, the monitor isn’t bright enough; for exam-
ple, when the setting sun is shining brightly waiting for “Sister Moon” (thank 
you, Sting). You can get some help by shading the monitor with your hand 
or the brim of a baseball cap. You can also get some assistance from the 
camera by changing the monitor brightness. You can increase or decrease 
the default brightness of your monitor in Auto mode. This option is handy 
when the monitor is too dark or too bright for your taste. You can also adjust 
the brightness manually.
To change the default monitor brightness in Auto mode:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button and then use the multi-controller button to 
navigate to the Camera Settings 2 tab (see the left side of Figure 4-8).
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight LCD Brightness and then 
press the Set button.
 
 The LCD Brightness menu displays (see the right side of Figure 4-8). In 
most instances, Auto is perfect, and it’s the default selection. You can, 
however, increase or decrease the relative brightness of your monitor to 
suit your vision and taste.
Figure 4-8: LCD brightness options.

71
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to increase or decrease brightness.
 
 Use this option if the default brightness of the LCD display is too dark or 
too bright.
 
4. Press Set.
 
 Your changes are applied.
 
Auto brightness relies on a sensor in front of the camera that monitors the 
ambient brightness. If you cover this sensor with your finger, the camera 
adjusts the monitor brightness to compensate for what is perceived as a dark 
ambient lighting, and the end result probably isn’t desirable.
You can also manually change the brightness of your monitor. When you 
choose the Manual option, the camera doesn’t automatically increase or 
decrease monitor brightness to compensate for ambient lighting. To manu-
ally change the brightness of your monitor:
 
1. Press the Menu button and then use the multi-controller button to 
navigate to the Camera Settings 2 tab.
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight LCD Brightness and then 
press the Set button.
 
 The LCD Brightness menu displays (see the left side of Figure 4-9).
 
 
3. Rotate the Main dial to highlight Manual and then press Set.
 
 The options for manually increasing or decreasing monitor brightness 
display (see the right side of Figure 4-9). You can choose from seven 
brightness levels.
Figure 4-9: Changing the LCD brightness.

72
Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to select the brightness level.
 
 As you rotate the dial, the thumbnail image gets brighter or darker. As 
you look at the back of the camera, rotate the dial to the right to make 
the image brighter, or left to make it darker.
 
5. When the thumbnail is easy to see in the current lighting conditions, 
press Set.
 
 Your changes are applied. You may have to manually adjust the monitor 
again if you take pictures in a brighter or darker environment than what 
you manually adjusted brightness in.
 
Making the monitor brighter does sap more juice from your battery, so unless 
you have a spare battery, increase monitor brightness at your discretion.
Deleting Images
When you review an image, you decide whether it’s a keeper. If while review-
ing an image, you don’t like the image for any reason, you can delete it. 
However, deleting images needs to be done with extreme caution because 
the task can’t be undone. After you delete an image from your card, it’s gone 
forever.
To delete a single image:
 
 
1. Press the Playback button repeatedly to navigate to the image you 
want to delete.
 
 Each time you press the button, you display a different image. 
Sometimes you’ll just know that an image is a clunker as soon as it 
appears on the LCD monitor, which is usually what happens to me. 
Unless I’m really pressed for time, I examine each image immediately 
after I shoot it.
 
 You can also review the images as thumbnails and delete an image. If 
you decide this is faster, I recommend you press the Set button to fill the 
monitor with the image before you delete it.
 
 
2. Press the Erase button.
 
 The Erase menu appears at the bottom of your monitor (see Figure 
4-10). At the risk of being redundant, deleting an image can’t be undone. 
At this stage, you still have the chance to stop this action by highlighting 
Cancel and then pressing Set.

73
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight Erase and press 
the Set button.
 
 The image is deleted.
You can also mark multiple images 
for deletion. This is similar to 
deleting a bunch of images in an 
image-editing program. My opinion: 
Images should be reviewed on a 
computer in which you have a bigger 
screen and it’s easier to examine 
images in detail. Deleting in the 
camera should be used only for obvi-
ous clunkers, such as out-of-focus 
images, or when you photographed a moving target like a bird in flight and 
cut off half his body. But some may find deleting multiple images useful, and 
you can do so with your EOS 7D. To delete multiple images:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last used camera menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the Playback Settings 1 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Erase Images and then press 
the Set button.
 
 The options for erasing images display on the camera LCD monitor (see 
the left side of Figure 4-11).
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Select and Erase Images (see 
the right side of Figure 4-11).

5. Press Set.
 
 A single image displays (see the left side of Figure 4-12) on the camera 
LCD monitor unless you’re viewing multiple thumbnails while reviewing. 
If you are reviewing single images and prefer to view thumbnails while 
marking images for deletion, press the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button to 
view three images as thumbnails.
 
6. Press Set to mark an image for deletion.
 
 After you mark an image for deletion, a check mark appears (see the 
right side of Figure 4-12).
Figure 4-12: Marking images for deletion.
 
 If you’re viewing three images as thumbnails, rotate the Quick Control 
dial to highlight an image and then press Set to mark it for deletion. After 
you mark a thumbnail for deletion, a check mark appears above it. I prefer 
to view one image at a time. The thumbnails are too small to give you 
enough information to determine whether an image needs to be deleted.
 
 If you accidentally select an image for deletion that you don’t want to 
delete, press Set to deselect the image.
 
 
 If you’re viewing thumbnails and want to see the bigger picture before 
you mark an image for deletion, press the AF Point Selection/Magnify 
button to display a single image on the monitor. Press the button again 
to zoom in and then use the multi-controller button to pan to different 
parts of the image.
 
7. Review other images and mark the duds for deletion.
 
 A check mark appears on the display when you mark an image for dele-
tion. The total number of images you’ve marked for deletion appears to 
the right of the word Set in the LCD monitor.

75
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
8. Press the Erase button to 
delete the images.
 
 The Erase Images menu displays 
(see Figure 4-13). At this stage, 
you still have the chance to 
back out if you navigate to the 
Cancel button and press Set.
 
9. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to highlight OK and then press 
Set.
 
 Faster than a bullet from a gun, 
the images are toast.
Your camera also has menu options 
to erase all images in a folder or on the card. This type of heavy lifting needs 
to be done with your computer and not in the camera because erasing 
images uses battery power. I always review my images after I download them 
to my computer and do wholesale deletion there. My computer has a bigger 
monitor in better light and most important, I’m seated in a comfortable chair. 
After all the heavy work is done on the computer, format the camera card 
and then you’re ready to shoot up a storm.
 
If you do a lot of work away from your main computer and need to download 
cards after a day of shooting, consider investing in one of the small netbook 
computers. You can install your image-editing software on the netbook, 
download images from a card, and then do some preliminary winnowing and 
editing. As of this writing, you can purchase a fairly potent netbook for less 
than $300.
Rotating Images
Many photographers — me included — rotate the camera 90 degrees when 
taking a picture of an object that’s taller than it is wide. When these images 
are displayed on the camera LCD monitor, you must rotate the camera 90 
degrees to view them in the correct orientation. If you don’t like doing this, 
a menu command will rotate the images for you. After you invoke this com-
mand, images display on your monitor in the proper orientation. You can 
also use a camera menu command to rotate the images when they are down-
loaded to your computer. To have the camera rotate images automatically:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button and then use the Quick Control dial to high-
light the Camera Settings 1 tab.

• Monitor and computer: Rotates the image automatically on the 
camera monitor and when downloaded to the computer.
 
• Monitor only: Rotates the image automatically on the computer 
monitor, but not on the camera.
 
• Off: Images are not rotated.
 
4. Press Set.
 
 All images taken from this point forward are rotated. Vertical images 
photographed before invoking this command are not rotated. If you 
choose to rotate the image when downloaded to your computer and it 
doesn’t rotate, your software can’t automatically rotate images from this 
command. If the camera is pointed up or down, an image photographed 
with the camera rotated 90 degrees may not rotate automatically.
Protecting Images
When you photograph a person, place, or thing, you’re freezing a moment in 
time, a moment that may never happen again. Therefore you need to be very 
careful when you delete images from a card because when deleted, an image 
is lost forever. That’s why I recommend doing the majority of your winnowing 

77
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
(photographer-speak for separating the duds from the keepers) in an 
image-editing program. However, if you decide to delete lots of your images 
with camera erase options, you can protect any image to prevent accidental 
deletion. Note: This also protects the image in Canon’s image-editing soft-
ware. This option, however, doesn’t protect the image when you format the 
card. To protect an image:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button and use the multi-controller button to navigate 
to the Playback Settings 1 tab.
 
 
 Protect Images is the first menu option (see the left side of Figure 4-15).
Figure 4-15: Protecting an image from accidental deletion.
 
 
2. Press the Set button.
 
 The last viewed image displays on the LCD monitor, with the last display 
view you selected. Remember, you can view images as thumbnails by 
pressing the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to navigate to an image you want to pro-
tect and then press Set.
 
 The image is protected and can’t be deleted. A lock icon appears on the 
screen when an image is protected (see the right side of Figure 4-15). 
Press Set again to unprotect a protected image.
 
 You can also protect images while viewing them as thumbnails. Press 
the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button once to view four thumbnail images 
or twice to view nine thumbnail images. Rotate the Quick Control dial to 
navigate to the next set of thumbnails and then use the multi-controller 
button to navigate to an individual thumbnail. Press Set to protect the 
highlighted image.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 to protect additional images.

5. Press the Menu button to return to the main menu.
 
 The images you’ve marked enter into the Pixel Protection Program.
 
Third-party software is available that can rescue images that were deleted 
accidentally or when a card becomes corrupt. In fact, SanDisk includes 
rescue software with some of its cards. If you do accidentally delete a keeper, 
you have to use the software immediately.
Using the Quick Control Screen
A good idea is to know what all the dials and buttons on your camera do. 
However, at times in the heat of battle you need to make one or more 
changes quickly, such as when you want to change image size, enable the 
10-second Self-Timer when shooting in Full Auto mode, or change multiple 
options quickly when shooting with one of the creative shooting modes. So if 
you’re in a New York state of mind and want to change camera settings in a 
New York minute, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Quick Control button.
 
 The Quick Control menu appears on your LCD monitor. The display 
varies depending on which mode you’ve selected from the Mode dial. 
Figure 4-16 shows the Quick Control screen when taking pictures in 
Aperture Priority mode.
 
 
2. Press the multi-controller 
button right or left to navigate 
between shooting options, and 
then rotate the Quick Control 
dial to change the setting.
 
 As you rotate the dial, the set-
ting changes. Alternatively, you 
can press the Set button after 
you select an option to display 
a screen showing all options. 
Figure 4-17 shows the screen 
that appears for changing ISO 
speed with the Quick Control 
screen. 
 
3. Repeat Step 2 for any other setting you want to modify.
Figure 4-16: Changing shooting options with 
the Quick Control screen.

 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
4. Press the shutter button half-
way to exit the Quick Control 
menu and begin taking pic-
tures with the new settings.
 
 Now that was quick and easy, 
wasn’t it?
 
When you choose Creative Auto 
from the Mode dial, a similar menu 
appears on the LCD monitor. For 
more information about taking pic-
tures in Creative Auto mode, refer to 
Chapter 2.
Viewing Images as a Slide Show
If you’re the type of photographer who likes to razzle and dazzle yourself and 
your friends by viewing images you’ve just shot on the camera LCD monitor — 
also known as chimping because of the noises photographers sometimes make 
when they see a cool image — you’ll love viewing images on the camera LCD 
monitor as a slide show. To view images as a slide show:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button and use the multi-controller button to navigate 
to the Playback Settings 2 tab.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Slide Show (see the left side 
of Figure 4-18) and then press the Set button.
 
 The Slide Show menu appears (see the right side of Figure 4-18). The 
default slide show displays all images with a 1-second delay, and the 
show loops until you exit the slide show. To accept the default slide 
show options, fast-forward to Step 6.

Part I: Getting to Know Your Canon EOS 7D 
Viewing Images on a TV Set
You have a digital camera capable of capturing colorful images with an 
impressive resolution of 18 megapixels. Your television set is a grand 
medium on which to display your images. You can display still images or a 
slide show on your TV screen. And if you have a high-definition (HD) televi-
sion set, you can knock your socks off — and for that matter, the socks of 
your friends and anybody else within viewing distance — by viewing your 
precious images onscreen. Video also looks awesome on a television set.
To view your images on a regular TV set:
 
1. Open the AV slot on the side of 
your camera (see Figure 4-21).
 
2. Insert the AV cable supplied 
with your camera into the 
AV/Video Out terminal.
 
 The Canon logo needs to face 
the back of the camera for 
proper insertion.
 
3. Connect the other end of the 
AV cable to your TV set.
 
 The plugs are color-coded. 
Connect the red and white plugs 
to the Audio In ports and the yellow plug to the Video In port on your TV 
set. Refer to your television manual to choose video as the input source.
 
4. Press the Playback button.
 
 An image displays on your television set.
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial to view the next image.
 
 You can also set up a slide show, as I outline in the section, “Viewing 
Images as a Slide Show,” earlier in this chapter.
To view images on an HD television set:
 
1. Open the AV slot on the side of your camera (see Figure 4-21).
 
2. Connect the HDMI cable HTC-100 (sold separately) to the HDMI Out 
terminal on your camera.
 
 The HDMI mini logo needs to face the front of the camera for proper 
insertion.
Figure 4-21: Accessing your camera’s AV slot.

83
 Chapter 4: Using the LCD Monitor
 
3. Connect the HDMI mini cable to your TV set and then press the 
Playback button.
 
 An image displays on your television set. Images are adjusted for opti-
mal viewing on an HD television set. If your set can’t display the cap-
tured images, unplug the HDMI cable from the camera and TV set; then 
connect the AV cable, as I outline in the preceding steps.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to view the next image.
 
 You can also set up a slide show, as I outline in the “Viewing Images as 
a Slide Show” section earlier in this chapter. In fact, if you’re viewing 
single images and decide you want to view them as a slide show, press 
the Menu button to display the camera menu on your TV screen and 
then follow the steps in that section.

Shoot Photography

Y
our EOS 7D is a very advanced camera. If all 
you do is stay in Full Auto mode, you’ve 
overlooked a lot of high power technology that 
Canon is very proud of. In this part, I show you 
how to use some of the very cool features of the 
camera. The camera has Live View, which means 
you can compose your images through the LCD 
monitor. You can also capture movies in Live View 
mode. I show you how to use all the Live View fea-
tures in this part. I also show you how to use the 
creative shooting modes to photograph action, 
wildlife, people, pets, places, and things.

Shooting Pictures and 
Movies with Live View
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring Live View menu options and photography
▶ Shooting and focusing in Live View mode
▶ Using the Quick Control menu
▶ Recording and previewing movies
▶ Getting some tips for movie shooting
P
hotographers who own point-and-shoot cameras use the LCD monitor 
to compose their pictures, which has some definite advan-
tages. For instance, you can place the camera close to the 
ground and compose an image through the monitor, or 
hold the camera over your head to do the same. Digital 
SLR (single-lens reflex) owners didn’t have this option 
until the Live View mode began popping up on digital 
SLR cameras. And fortunately for you, your EOS 7D 
has this option. Live View mode has lots of benefits 
to shooting, including what you see is what you get. 
However, Live View mode has a few disadvantages 
as well. You hold the camera in front of you at 
arm’s length, which, unless you work out at the 
gym five days a week, can be a bit tiring. Many 
people use tripods when shooting images and movies 
using Live View mode.

88
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
In addition to taking great pictures in Live View mode, you can also capture 
high-definition (HD) movies. You can specify the size of the movie and the 
frame rate. I own an EOS 5D MKII, which can also capture HD video; however, 
the video features and capabilities on the EOS 7D are far superior to those 
of my other camera. So if you’re ready to go live, read on. In this chapter, I 
show you how to take pictures, capture movies, and more in the upcoming 
sections.
Enabling Live View Shooting
Before you can take pictures using Live View, you have to enable the feature. 
You do so using a menu command. You can still shoot movies even if Live 
View shooting is disabled. To enable Live View shooting:
 
 
1. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting 
Settings 4 tab.
 
 These are your menu options for Live View shooting.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Live View Shoot (see the left 
side of Figure 5-1) and then press the Set button.
 
 Your Live View Shoot options display on the camera LCD monitor (see 
the right side of Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1: Enabling Live View.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Enable and then press Set.
 
 You’re now ready to shoot pictures with Live View.

89
 Chapter 5: Shooting Pictures and Movies with Live View
Taking Pictures with Live View
Live View is the bee’s knees when it comes to picture taking. You have a 
much larger view of your subject and you can compose pictures holding the 
camera low to the ground — which beats crawling on your belly — or over 
your head. To take pictures in Live View mode:
 
 
1. Press the Start/Stop button.
 
 What’s in the lens’s field of view appears on the camera monitor.
 
2. Press the shutter button half-
way to focus the scene (see 
Figure 5-2).
 
 The camera inherits the current 
autofocus (AF) mode and AF 
points from standard shooting 
(see Chapter 7) if you use Live 
View Quick mode, as shown 
in Figure 5-2. When you use 
Live AF mode or Live (Face 
Detection) AF mode, you use 
a single autofocus point in the 
center of the frame. You can 
use the Quick Control dial to 
move the AF point in any of the 
Live View AF modes.
 
 The default autofocus mode works great when shooting in Live View 
mode, but I prefer using zone focus and specifying the middle zone. You 
can also specify the type of focusing Live View uses (see the “Focusing 
with Live View” section of this chapter).
 
 To display the electronic level while shooting pictures in Live View 
mode, press the Info button to cycle through the information displays 
until you see the level.
 
3. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 The LCD monitor displays the image almost immediately. After the des-
ignated image-review time, the monitor returns to Live View mode.
 
4. Press the Start/Stop button to exit Live View mode.
 
 The camera automatically exits Live View mode after the time desig-
nated by auto power-off (see Chapter 1).
Figure 5-2: Focusing in Live View mode.

Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
When you shoot in Live View mode, you hold the camera in front of you. 
Therefore, you can’t hold the camera as steadily as you could when shooting 
through the viewfinder. Using a lens with image stabilization helps, but if you 
don’t have one, shoot at a higher shutter speed than you normally would. 
For example, if you’re taking pictures in Live View mode with a lens that’s the 
35mm equivalent of 85mm, use a shutter speed of 1/125 of a second or faster. 
Otherwise, mount the camera on a tripod.
Shooting images in Live View mode takes a toll on battery life. You’ll get any-
where from 210 to 230 images on a fully charged battery depending upon the 
ambient temperature and the amount of images taken with flash.
 
When you shoot in Live View mode in hot conditions or in direct sunlight, 
the internal temperature of the camera increases. A warning icon appears 
when the internal temperature of the camera is at the danger point. Press the 
Start/Stop button to stop Live View as soon as you see this warning.
 
When shooting in Live View mode, don’t point the camera directly at the sun. 
Because the mirror is locked during Live View, exposure to the sun can 
damage internal components of the camera.
Displaying shooting information
Shooting information is important to many photographers. When you com-
pose a picture in standard shooting mode, you have a lot of information at 
your disposal in the viewfinder and on the LCD panel. You can also display 
information when shooting in Live View mode by pressing the Info button. 
Each time you press the button, the 
screen changes. The default screen 
shows the autofocus (AF) points 
without shooting information. Press 
the Info button once to display the 
screen, as shown in Figure 5-3.
The first level of information displays 
the exposure compensation scale, 
shots remaining on the memory 
card, the ISO speed setting, and the 
battery status. Press the shutter 
button halfway, and the AF points 
that will focus the image are illumi-
nated in red and the shutter speed 
and aperture display.
Figure 5-3: Displaying exposure information 
while shooting in Live View mode.

91
 Chapter 5: Shooting Pictures and Movies with Live View
To view additional information, 
press the Info button again. The 
second level of information (see 
Figure 5-4) displays all the informa-
tion from the preceding screen with 
these additions: the Live View AF 
mode, the image format, exposure 
simulation, Auto Lighting Optimizer 
mode, picture style, and white bal-
ance. You see additional information 
if you’ve enabled features, such as 
flash exposure bracketing, automatic 
exposure bracketing, and so on. The 
flash icon appears if the built-in flash 
has popped up.
If you accept the default option 
of Exposure Simulation, press 
the button again and a histogram 
appears (see Figure 5-5). You can 
use this information to increase or 
decrease the exposure with expo-
sure compensation.
Focusing with Live View
When you shoot in Live View mode, 
you have three focusing options. 
Two options are used for taking 
photographs of landscapes and 
objects, and the other focusing mode is used to detect faces. To specify the 
autofocus (AF) mode:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting 
Settings 4 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight AF Mode (see the left side of 
Figure 5-6) and then press the Set button.
 
 The Live View AF mode options display on the camera LCD monitor (see 
the right side of Figure 5-6).

Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Figure 5-6: Choosing a Live View AF mode.
 
4. Use the Quick Control dial to highlight one of the following options:
 
• Live Mode: Uses the sensor to focus. This option takes longer to 
focus than Quick mode.
 
• Live Mode (Face Detection): Uses the sensor to focus but detects 
faces.
 
• Quick Mode: Uses the camera AF sensor to focus the image. As the 
name implies, this mode is quicker than using the camera sensor. 
The Live View image momentarily blacks out while the camera 
achieves focus.
 
5. Press Set.
 
 The selected focusing mode is used whenever you shoot images with 
Live View.
After working with the camera, I find that Quick mode does the best job of 
focusing. Occasionally the Live View modes have problems achieving focus. 
If you prefer to use one of the Live View focus modes, you find the camera 
has a difficult time focusing, and you have a lens that lets you focus manually 
when in autofocus mode, twist the focus ring until the scene is close to being 
in focus and then the Live View focusing should snap the scene into focus.
To focus the camera while using Live Mode focusing:
 
1. Press the Start/Stop button to enable Live View shooting.
 
 An autofocus (AF) point appears in the center of the image.
 
2. (Optional) Use the multi-controller button to move the AF point.

93
 Chapter 5: Shooting Pictures and Movies with Live View
 
 Move the AF point over the part of the image that you want the camera 
to focus.
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 When the camera achieves focus, the AF point turns green and the 
camera beeps.
 
4. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The camera takes the picture.
To focus the camera with Live Mode (Face Detection) focusing:
 
1. Press the Start/Stop button to enable Live View shooting.
 
 An AF point appears in the center of the image.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 The camera sensor detects faces in front of the lens by placing a rect-
angular AF frame over it. When the camera achieves focus, the frame 
turns green and the camera beeps. If the camera detects multiple faces, 
an AF frame with a right- and left-pointing arrow appears. Use the multi-
controller button to drag the AF frame over the person who’s the center 
of interest and should be in focus.
 
3. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The camera takes the picture.
To focus with Quick Mode focusing:
 
1. Press the Start/Stop button to enable Live View shooting.
 
 An autofocus frame point appears in the center of the image.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 The AF points for the autofocus point mode you specify for standard 
shooting appear on the camera LCD monitor. A white frame appears 
over the AF points. The point used to achieve focus turns red.
 
3. (Optional) Use the multi-controller button to move the white autofocus 
frame.
 
4. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The camera takes the picture.

94
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Using the Quick Control menu to shoot 
pictures in Live View mode
When you shoot in Live View mode, you can quickly change the Auto 
Lighting Optimizer and the image quality through the Quick Control menu. 
If you’re using the Quick Live View autofocus (AF) mode, you can change 
the AF points as well. To change Live View shooting options with the Quick 
Control menu:
 
 
1. Press the Start/Stop button to 
enable Live View shooting and 
then press the Quick Control 
button.
 
 The Quick Control menu 
appears on the LCD monitor 
(see Figure 5-7).
 
2. Use the multi-controller button 
to navigate to and highlight an 
option.
 
 The option icon becomes blue. 
In Figure 5-7, the Auto Lighting 
Optimizer is highlighted. The 
current option is Standard, as 
noted on the bottom of the screen. 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to change the option setting.
 
 As you rotate the Quick Control dial, you see different icons on the 
screen. With the exception of the AF points at the bottom of the screen, 
you see text that describes what the icon represents. For example, if 
you’re changing image quality, you see the format and size displayed.
 
4. Use the multi-controller button and the Quick Control dial to change 
other settings as needed and then press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re ready to start shooting with your new settings.
Displaying a grid in Live View mode
When shooting in Live View mode, you can display a grid on the LCD moni-
tor. This grid is useful when aligning objects that are supposed to be horizon-
tal or vertical. You can also use the grid when composing your images (see 
Chapter 7). You have two grids from which to choose: one with 9 squares and 
Figure 5-7: Using the Live View picture-taking 
Quick Control menu.

95
 Chapter 5: Shooting Pictures and Movies with Live View
another with 24 squares. To display a grid on the camera LCD monitor when 
shooting in Live View mode:
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu appears.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting 
Settings 4 tab.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Grid Display (see the left 
side of Figure 5-8) and then press the Set button.
 
 The Grid Display options display (see the right side of Figure 5-8).
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the desired grid.
 
 In my opinion, the first grid, with nine squares, is the most useful. This is 
identical to the Rule of Thirds (see Chapter 8) photographers use when 
composing images.
 
5. Press Set.
 
 The selected grid displays in the monitor when you shoot in Live View 
mode.
Figure 5-8: Enabling the Live View grid.
Exploring Other Useful Live View Options
In the previous sections of this chapter, I discuss menu commands that 
enable Live View shooting, choose a Live View autofocus mode, and display 
a grid over the LCD monitor while shooting in Live View mode. You may find 

96
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
other Live View menu options and one custom function (that displays a crop-
ping grid) useful. To take a look at the other options, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu 
displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button 
to navigate to the Shooting 
Settings 4 tab (see Figure 5-9).
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to review these commands:
 
• Expo. Simulation: This 
option is selected by 
default and displays a 
histogram with one of 
the shooting information 
displays. When this command is enabled, Exposure Simulation 
appears on the LCD monitor when you enable Live View. Press the 
Info button until you see the histogram. Use the histogram to make 
sure the image is exposed properly.
 
• Silent Shooting: You have three options from which to choose. 
Mode 1 is considerably quieter than normal Live View shooting. 
When you choose this option, you can shoot continuously. If you 
choose high speed continuous shooting, you can capture images at 
7 fps (frames per second). Mode 2 takes one shot when you press 
the shutter. Camera operation is suspended as long as the shutter 
button is pressed. When you release the shutter button, camera 
operation resumes. This mode is quieter than Mode 1. Your third 
option is to disable silent shooting.
You can enable a custom function that displays a cropping grid on the 
camera LCD monitor. You can choose a specific aspect ratio that matches 
the paper upon which you print your images. For example, if you’re shooting 
an image that’ll be printed on 8-x-10-photographic paper, you’d use the 4:5 
aspect ratio. To display a cropping grid on the camera LCD monitor:
 
 
1. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom Functions 
tab.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight C.Fn IV: Operation/Others 
(see the left side of Figure 5-10) and then press the Set button.
Figure 5-9: Other useful Live View menu 
options.

97
 Chapter 5: Shooting Pictures and Movies with Live View
Figure 5-10: Displaying a cropping grid in Live View mode.
 
 The last used Operation/Others custom function displays.
 
3. Press the multi-controller button until the number 4 displays in the 
window on the right side of the menu and then press the Set button.
 
 The current option displays (see the right side of Figure 5-10). If you 
haven’t used this function before, the Off option is blue.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to select the desired aspect ratio.
 
 Use the Quick Control dial to scroll down if you don’t see the aspect 
ratio that matches your paper size.
 
5. Press Set.
 
 The highlighted option becomes blue.
 
6. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You exit the menu and return to shooting mode. The next time you 
enable Live View shooting, blue lines designate the aspect ratio. As long 
as you keep the important information between the lines, it appears in 
the final image after you crop it in your image-editing application.
Making Movies with Your Camera
With your EOS 7D, you can create high-definition (HD) video. Your camera 
records video in Apple’s QuickTime MOV format. You can specify the size of 
the movies you capture and the frame rate. In the following sections, I show 
you how to capture video and other movie-shooting tasks with your camera.

98
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Recording movies
Recording movies on your EOS 7D is easy. Flip a switch and push a button 
and you’re recording. And you see the whole movie unfold on the camera 
LCD monitor. When you’ve recorded your fill, push the button again to stop 
recording. You can preview the movie on the camera LCD monitor to decide 
whether you want to keep it. When recording movies in a shooting mode 
other than M (Manual), the camera automatically determines the aperture, 
shutter speed, and ISO speed based on the current ambient lighting condi-
tions. Monaural sound is recorded with your movie unless you disable sound 
or insert a stereo microphone into the microphone in-port on the side of the 
camera. To record a movie:
 
 
1. Flip the Live View/Movie Shooting switch to the left.
 
 The switch stops at the red icon that looks like a movie camera. The 
scene in front of your lens displays on the LCD monitor. With all the 
shooting information displayed, the remaining recording time displays 
next to the video size and frame rate information.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 When you record movies, you use one of the Live View autofocus modes 
that I discuss in the “Focusing with Live View” section earlier in this 
chapter. If the camera can’t achieve focus, switch the lens to manual 
focus and twist the focusing ring until your subject snaps into focus.
 
 
 You can also achieve focus with the AF-On button.
 
 You can lock exposure to a 
specific part of the scene you’re 
recording by moving the center 
autofocus point over the spot 
that you want to lock focus 
and then pressing the AE Lock/
Index/Reduce button.
 
 
3. Press the Start/Stop button.
 
 A red dot appears in the upper-
right corner of the LCD monitor 
when you’re recording (see 
Figure 5-11), and the elapsed 
time appears in the lower-left 
Figure 5-11: Quiet, numbskulls. You’re making 
a movie here.

corner. A semi-transparent frame appears around the edge of the Live 
View image. The area inside the frame is what the camera records. Total 
recording time with a fully charged battery is approximately 1 hour and 
20 minutes at 73 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 
 To display the electronic level while shooting video in Live View mode, 
press the Info button to cycle through the information displays until you 
see the level.
 
4. Press the Start/Stop button.
 
 Recording stops and the red dot disappears.
Using manual exposure when recording a movie
You can manually expose your movies to gain complete control. When you 
manually expose a movie, you can set the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO 
speed rating. This is useful when you want to control the depth of field in a 
movie. For example, when you’re recording a video of a scenic vista, a small 
aperture gives you a greater depth of field. When you manually expose a 
movie, use the exposure compensation scale at the bottom of the LCD moni-
tor as a meter. To manually expose a movie:
 
1. Flip the Live View/Movie Shooting switch to the left.
 
 Live View video recording is enabled.
 
2. Press the Info button until you see the exposure compensation scale in 
the lower-left corner of the Live View display.
 
 Use this scale to get the correct exposure.
 
3. Rotate the Mode dial to M.
 
 You can manually set exposure in this mode.
 
4. Point the camera toward the scene you’re going to record.
 
 
5. Press the ISO/Flash Compensation button and then rotate the Quick 
Control dial to set the desired ISO speed setting.
 
 Choose the lowest possible speed for the lighting conditions while main-
taining an acceptable shutter speed.
 
 
6. Rotate the Main dial to set the shutter speed and then rotate the Quick 
Control dial to set the aperture.

100
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
 While setting the shutter speed 
and aperture, look at the expo-
sure compensation scale. A 
flashing bar appears below the 
scale when the exposure isn’t 
perfect. If the bar is to the left of 
center (as shown in Figure 5-12), 
you need to increase exposure; 
if it’s to the right, you need to 
decrease exposure. When the 
indicator bar is aligned per-
fectly with the center of the 
scale, the exposure is perfect 
for the lighting conditions.
 
7. Press the Start/Stop button to start recording video and then press it 
again to stop recording.
 
 When you’re finished recording, make sure you choose a different shoot-
ing mode or manually set exposure for the next scene you’re going to 
record.
Displaying video shooting information
When recording video, you can display a lot of shooting information, a little 
information, or no information. You can display the aperture and shutter 
speed, battery information, exposure compensation scale, autofocus mode, 
and much more, depending on which information screen you display. To dis-
play information when recording movies:
 
1. Flip the Live View/Movie Shooting switch to the left.
 
 Live View movie recording is enabled.
 
2. Press the Info button.
 
 A shooting information screen is displayed.
 
3. Press the Info button repeatedly to display different shooting 
information.
The first shooting information screen (see the top image in Figure 5-13) dis-
plays the focus frame. This is perfect for when you’re going commando and 
want to see every subtle nuance of the scene you’re recording. The second 
shooting screen (middle image) displays the battery information, the number 
Figure 5-12: Setting exposure manually.

101
 Chapter 5: Shooting Pictures and Movies with Live View
of shots remaining on the card, the 
shutter speed, aperture, ISO speed 
rating, and the exposure compensa-
tion scale. The third shooting screen 
(bottom image) shows everything 
except the kitchen sink. On this 
screen, you find all the information 
on the previous screen plus the auto-
focus mode, image recording format, 
movie size, frame rate, Auto Lighting 
Optimizer, picture style, and white 
balance.
Changing video dimen-
sions and frame rate
Your camera can capture high-
definition video with dimensions of 
up to 1920 x 1080 and a frame rate up

of this book. For more information, check out Digital Video For Dummies, 4th 
Edition, by Keith Underdahl.
Taking a still picture while recording a movie
You can take a picture while recording a movie. This option is handy when 
you’re making a recording and something interesting happens that you 
want to save as a still picture. The still image uses the exposure information 
displayed in the Live View shooting information. The image is the format 
and quality you specify with the camera menu. To take a still picture while 
recording a video:
 
1. Begin recording a movie.
 
2. Press the shutter button when you see something you want to record 
as a still image.

image format and size, video 
dimensions, and frame rate.
 
3. Use the multi-controller button 
to highlight an option.
 
 The highlighted item turns blue.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to change the setting; then 
press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re ready to record video with the new settings.
Previewing Movies on the Camera LCD Monitor
You can preview movies in all their glory on the camera LCD monitor. When 
you preview a movie, buttons appear that let you play the movie at full speed 
or in slow motion, pause the movie, preview it frame by frame, and navigate 
to the first or last frame. You can also edit movies in the camera, which I show 
you how to do in Chapter 11. To preview a movie on the camera LCD monitor:

Tips for Movie Shooting
Your camera captures awesome video. I’ve used my EOS 7D to capture some 
beautiful video from the nearby beaches. I’ll send a copy of the video to my 
relatives who live north of the Mason-Dixon line in January to show them 
how the other half lives. I’ve also seen some awesome videos on the Web that 
were shot with this camera. Here are a few movie-shooting tips:
 
✓ For the best results, consider purchasing a high speed UDMA card that 
writes data at a speed of 8MB per second.
 
✓ Don’t point the camera directly at the sun when shooting video, which 
can damage the camera sensor.
 
✓ Mount the camera on a tripod; it’s hard to hold a camera steady for a 
long time while recording video. If your tripod has a pan head, you’re in 
business.
 
✓ Pan slowly. If you pan too fast, your video looks very amateurish.
 
✓ If you plan on doing a lot of video recording with your camera, consider 
purchasing a device that steadies the camera (such as SteadiCam) while 
you move. You can find these at your favorite camera retailer that also 
sells video equipment.
 
✓ Remember to push the Start/Stop button when you’re finished record-
ing. Otherwise, you get several minutes of very choppy video as you 
move to the next scene. Worst-case scenario, you capture video of your 
feet shuffling on the sidewalk.

our camera has a plethora of features that are 
designed to enable you to capture stunning 
images. You can shoot images continuously, which 
is great for action photography. In fact, the camera 
has two speeds for continuous shooting. The Hi 
Speed Continuous mode lets you capture images 
at up to 8 frames per second (fps), which means 
you can capture a bunch of images really fast. Your 
camera also has modes that take you way beyond 
point-and-shoot photography. When you take pho-
tographs with either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter 

108
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Priority (Tv) mode, you supply one part of the exposure equation and your 
EOS 7D supplies the other part. Plus you can do all sorts of things to hedge 
your bet and make sure you get stellar photos from your camera. You can 
use exposure compensation when you need to tweak the exposure the 
camera meters. You can also bracket exposure and tweak the white balance.
If you’re a geek photographer like me who likes complete control over 
every aspect of your photography, you’ll love the features I show you in 
this chapter.
Understanding Metering
Your camera’s metering device examines the scene and determines which 
shutter speed and f-stop combination will yield a properly exposed image. 
The camera can choose a fast shutter speed and large aperture, or a slow 
shutter speed and small aperture.
When you take pictures in Full Auto or Creative Auto mode, the camera 
makes both decisions for you. But you’re much smarter than the processor 
inside your camera. If you take control of the reins and supply one piece 
of the puzzle, the camera will supply the rest. When you’re taking certain 
types of pictures, it makes sense to determine which f-stop will be best 
for what you’re photographing. In other scenarios, it makes more sense to 
choose the shutter speed and let the camera determine the f-stop. In the 
upcoming sections, I show you how to use the creative shooting modes 
your camera has to offer. In Chapter 8, I show you how to use these modes 
for specific picture-taking situations.
Taking Pictures with Creative Modes
You bought an EOS 7D because you’re a creative photographer. The Full 
Auto and Creative Auto shooting modes are useful when you’re getting used 
to the camera. But after you know where the controls are, branch out and 
use shooting modes in which you control the manner that your images are 
exposed. In the upcoming sections, I show you how to expose images with 
the creative shooting modes: P (Programmed Auto Exposure), Av (Aperture 
Priority), Tv (Shutter Priority), M (Manual), and B (Bulb).

109
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
The following list describes each mode in detail:
 
✓ Programmed Auto Exposure mode: This mode is like stepping out 
of the kid’s pool into the shallow end of the deep pool. The camera 
still determines what shutter speed and aperture will yield a perfectly 
exposed image, but you can change the values to suit the type of scene 
you’re photographing. 
 
✓ Aperture Priority mode: When you switch to this mode, you supply the 
f-stop value (aperture) and the camera determines what shutter speed 
will result in a perfectly exposed image.
 
✓ Shutter Priority mode: In this mode, you determine the shutter speed 
and the camera does the math to determine what f-stop value (aperture) 
is needed to create a pixel-perfect image.
 
✓ Manual mode: When you decide to shoot in this mode, you supply the 
shutter speed and f-stop, but the camera does give you some help in 
determining whether the combination you provide will yield a perfectly 
exposed image.
 
✓ Bulb mode: If you’ve been a photographer for any length of time, you 
know that the Bulb mode enables you to shoot time exposures, which 
means the shutter can stay open longer than the slowest shutter speed 
provided by the camera, which is 30 seconds.
But before you can determine which mode is best for you, you need to under-
stand how exposure works, which is the topic of the next section.
Understanding how exposure works in the camera
Your EOS 7D exposes images the same way as film cameras did. Light enters 
the camera through the lens and is recorded on the sensor. The amount 
of time the shutter is open and the amount of light entering the camera 
determine whether the resulting image is too dark, too bright, or properly 
exposed.
The duration of the exposure is the shutter speed. Your camera has a shutter 
speed range from as long as 30 seconds in duration to as fast as 1/8000 of a 
second. A fast shutter speed stops action, and a slow shutter speed leaves 
the shutter open for a long time to record images in low-light situations.

110
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
The aperture is the opening in the lens that lets light into the camera when 
the shutter opens. You can change the aperture diameter to let a lot, or a 
small amount, of light into the camera. The f-stop value determines the size 
of the aperture. A low f-stop value (large aperture) lets a lot of light into the 
camera, and a high f-stop value (small aperture) lets a small amount of light 
into the camera. Depending on the lens you’re using, the f-stop range can be 
from f/1.8, which sends huge gobs of light into the camera, to f/32, which lets 
in a miniscule splash of light into the camera. The f-stop also determines the 
depth of field, a concept I explain in the “Controlling depth of field” section 
later in this chapter.
The duration of the exposure (shutter speed) and aperture (f-stop value) 
combination determines the exposure. For each lighting scenario you 
encounter, several different combinations render a perfectly exposed pho-
tograph. Use different combinations for different types of photography. The 
camera’s metering device examines the scene and determines which shut-
ter speed and f-stop combination will yield a properly exposed image. The 
camera can choose a fast shutter speed and large aperture, or a slow shutter 
speed and small aperture.
Using Programmed Auto Exposure mode
When you take pictures with the Programmed Auto Exposure mode, the 
camera determines the shutter speed and aperture (f-stop value) that yields a 
properly exposed image for the lighting conditions. Even though this sounds 
identical to Full Auto mode, with 
this mode you can change the AF 
(autofocus) mode, Drive mode, ISO 
speed, picture style, and more. You 
can also change the shutter speed 
and aperture to suit the scene you’re 
photographing. To take pictures in 
Programmed Auto Exposure mode:
 
1. Rotate the Mode dial to P (see 
Figure 6-1).
 
 
2. Press the ISO/Flash 
Compensation button and then 
rotate the Main dial to change 
the ISO speed to the desired 
setting.
Figure 6-1: Rotating the Mode dial to P.

111
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
 
 Higher ISO speeds make the camera sensor more sensitive to light, 
which is ideal when you’re photographing in dim light or at night. For 
more information on changing ISO speed, see Chapter 7.
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 The green dot on the right side of the viewfinder appears when the 
camera achieves focus. If the dot is flashing, the camera can’t achieve 
focus and you must manually focus the camera.
 
4. Check the shutter speed and aperture.
 
 You can use the viewfinder or LCD panel (see Figure 6-2) to check the 
shutter speed and aperture. If you notice a shutter speed of 8000 and the 
minimum aperture for the lens blinking, the image will be overexposed. 
If you notice a shutter speed of 30 seconds and the maximum aperture 
for the lens blinking, the image will be underexposed.
Figure 6-2: Check the shutter speed and aperture.
 
5. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 The image displays almost immediately on your LCD monitor.
You can shift the exposure and choose a different shutter speed and aperture 
combination. Use this option when you want to shoot with a faster shutter 
speed to freeze action or a different aperture to control depth of field. To 
shift the Programmed Auto Exposure:
 
1. Follow Steps 1–3 of the preceding instructions; then press the shutter 
button halfway.
 
 The camera achieves focus.
 
2. With the shutter button depressed halfway, rotate the Main dial.

112
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
 This can be a bit of a juggling act, but is manageable if you use your 
middle finger to press the shutter button and your forefinger to rotate the 
Main dial. As you rotate the dial, you see different shutter speed and aper-
ture combinations in the viewfinder and LCD panel (see Figure 6-3). If you 
notice that the shutter speed is too slow for a blur-free picture, you have 
to put the camera on a tripod or increase the ISO speed setting.
 
3. When you see the desired combination of shutter speed and aperture, 
press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 The image appears almost immediately on your LCD monitor.
Figure 6-3: You can shift programmed exposure.
Using Aperture Priority mode
If you like to photograph landscapes, Aperture Priority mode is right 
up your alley. When you take pictures with Aperture Priority mode, you 
choose the desired f-stop and the camera supplies the proper shutter speed 
to achieve a properly exposed image. A large aperture (small f-stop value) 
lets a lot of light into the camera, and a small aperture (large f-stop value) 
lets a small amount of light into the camera. The benefit of shooting in 
Aperture Priority mode is that you have complete control over the depth 
of field (see the “Controlling depth of field” section later in this chapter). 
You also have access to all the other options, such as setting the ISO speed, 
choosing a picture style, working in an AF mode or a Drive mode, and so on. 
To take pictures with Aperture Priority mode:
 
1. Rotate the Mode dial to Av (see Figure 6-4).
 
2. Press the ISO/Flash Compensation button and then rotate the Main 
dial to change the ISO speed to the desired setting.

113
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
 
 When choosing an ISO speed, 
choose the slowest speed for 
the available lighting conditions. 
For more information on chang-
ing ISO speed, see Chapter 7.
 
3. Rotate the Main dial to select 
the desired f-stop.
 
 As you change the aperture, the 
camera calculates the proper 
shutter speed to achieve a prop-
erly exposed image. The change 
appears in the LCD panel and 
the viewfinder. As you rotate 
the dial, monitor the shutter 
speed in the viewfinder (see 
Figure 6-5). If you notice that the 
shutter speed is too slow 
for a blur-free pic-
ture, you have to 
put the camera on 
a tripod or increase 
the ISO speed set-
ting. If you see the 
minimum shutter 
speed (30 seconds) 
blinking, the image 
will be underexposed 
with the selected 
f-stop. If you see 
the maximum shut-
ter speed (1/8000 
second) blinking, the 
image will be over-
exposed with the 
selected f-stop.
 
4. Press the shutter 
button halfway to 
achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears in the viewfinder when the camera achieves focus.
Figure 6-4: Rotating the Mode dial to Av.
Figure 6-5: Make sure the shutter speed is fast enough for a 
blur-free picture.

5. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 The image appears on your LCD monitor almost immediately.
Controlling depth of field
Depth of field determines how much of your image looks sharp and is in 
apparent focus in front of and behind your subject. When you’re taking 
pictures of landscapes on a bright sunny day, you want a depth of field that 
produces an image in which you can see the details for miles and miles 
and miles . . . Other times, you want to have a very shallow depth of field 
in which your subject is in sharp focus but the foreground and background 
are a pleasant out-of-focus blur. A shallow depth of field is ideal when 
you’re shooting a portrait.
You control the depth of field in an image by selecting the f-stop in Aperture 
Priority mode and letting the camera do the math to determine what shutter 
speed will yield a properly exposed image. You get a limited depth of field 
when using a small f-stop value (large aperture), which lets a lot of light into 
the camera. A fast lens
 
✓ Has an f-stop value of 2.8 or smaller
 
✓ Gives you the capability to shoot in low-light conditions
 
✓ Gives you a wonderfully shallow depth of field
When shooting at a lens’s smallest f-stop value, you’re letting the most 
amount of light into the camera, which is known as shooting wide open. The 
lens you use also determines how large the depth of field will be for a given 
f-stop. At the same f-stop, a wide-angle lens has a greater depth of field than 
a telephoto lens. When you’re photographing a landscape, the ideal recipe 
is a wide-angle lens and a small aperture (large f-stop value). When you’re 
shooting a portrait of someone, you want a shallow depth of field. Therefore, 
a telephoto lens with a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm with 
a large aperture (small f-stop value) is the ideal solution.
Figure 6-6 shows two pictures of the same subject. The first image was shot 
with an exposure of 1/640 second at f/1.8, and the second image was shot 
with an exposure of 1/80 second at f/10. In both cases, I focused on the sub-
ject. Notice how much more of the image shot at f/10 is in focus. The detail 
of the flowers in the second shot distracts the viewer’s attention from the 
subject. The first image has a shallow depth of field that draws the viewer’s 
attention to the subject.

115
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
Figure 6-6: The f-stop you choose determines the depth of field.
Using depth-of-field preview
When you compose a scene through your viewfinder, the camera aperture 
is wide open, which means you have no idea how much depth of field you’ll 
have in the resulting image. You can preview the depth of field for a selected 
f-stop by pressing a button on your camera. To preview depth of field:
 
1. Compose the picture and choose the desired f-stop in Aperture 
Priority mode.
 
 See the section, “Using Aperture Priority mode,” earlier in this chapter if 
you need help.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green dot shines solid on the right side of the viewfinder when the 
camera focuses on your subject.

116
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
3. Press the Depth-of-Field 
Preview button (see 
Figure 6-7).
 
 The button is conveniently 
located on the left-front side of 
the camera when your camera 
is pointed toward your sub-
ject. You can easily locate the 
button by feel. When you press 
the button, the image in the 
viewfinder may become dim, 
especially when you’re using 
a small aperture (large f-stop 
number) that doesn’t let a lot 
of light into the camera. Don’t 
worry, the camera chooses the proper shutter speed to compensate 
for the f-stop you select.
 
 When you use depth-of-field preview, pay attention to how much of the 
image is in apparent focus in front of and behind your subject. To see 
what the depth of field looks like with different f-stops:
 
a. Select what you think is the optimal f-stop for the scene you’re 
photographing.
 
b. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus, as I outline earlier, 
and then rotate the Main dial to choose different f-stop values.
 
 As long as you hold down the Depth-of-Field Preview button while 
you’re choosing different f-stops, you can see the effect each f-stop 
has on the depth of field.
Using Shutter Priority mode
When your goal is to accentuate an object’s motion, choose Shutter Priority 
mode. When you take pictures in Shutter Priority mode, you choose the shut-
ter speed and the camera supplies the proper f-stop value to properly expose 
the scene. Your camera has a shutter speed range from 30 seconds to 1/8000 of 
a second. When you choose a slow shutter speed, the shutter is open for a long 
time. When you choose a fast shutter speed, the shutter is open for a short 
duration and you can freeze action. To take pictures in Shutter Priority mode:
 
1. Rotate the Mode dial to Tv (see Figure 6-8).
 
2. Rotate the Main dial to choose the desired shutter speed.
Depth-of-Field Preview button
Figure 6-7: The Depth-of-Field Preview button.

117
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
 
 As you change the shutter 
speed, the camera determines 
the proper f-stop to achieve a 
properly exposed image. If you 
notice that the shutter speed is 
too slow for a blur-free picture, 
you have to put the camera on 
a tripod or increase the ISO 
speed setting. If you see the 
minimum aperture (largest 
f-stop value) for the lens blink-
ing, the image will be underex-
posed with the selected shutter 
speed. If you see the maximum 
aperture (smallest f-stop 
number) blinking, the image 
will be overexposed with the 
selected shutter speed. If you 
choose a shutter speed that’s 
too slow for a blur-free picture, mount the camera on a tripod or choose 
a higher ISO speed setting.
 
3. Press the ISO/Flash Compensation button and then rotate the Main 
dial to change the ISO speed to the desired setting.
 
 Choose an ISO setting that enables you to achieve the desired shutter 
speed. For more information on changing ISO speed, see Chapter 7.
 
4. Rotate the Main dial to choose the desired shutter speed.
 
 As you rotate the dial, the shutter speed value changes on the LCD panel 
and in the viewfinder. I rarely look at the LCD panel when changing shut-
ter speed or aperture. I like to see my subject while I make the changes.
 
5. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears in the right side of the viewfinder. If the dot is 
flashing, the camera can’t achieve focus. If this occurs, switch the lens 
to manual focus and twist the focusing barrel until your subject snaps 
into focus. Figure 6-9 shows the viewfinder when working in Shutter 
Priority mode.
 
6. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 Shutter Priority mode is the way to go whenever you need to stop 
action or show the grace of an athlete in motion. You’d use Shutter 
Priority mode in lots of scenarios. Figure 6-10 shows the effects you

can achieve with different shutter speeds. The image on the left was 
photographed with a slow shutter speed, and the image on the right 
was photographed with a fast shutter speed to freeze the action. For 
more information on using Shutter Priority mode when photographing 
action, check out Chapter 8.

 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
Manually exposing images
You can also manually expose your images. When you choose this option, 
you supply the f-stop value and the shutter speed. You can choose from 
several combinations to properly expose the image for the lighting condi-
tions. Your camera meter gives you some assistance to select the right f-stop 
and shutter speed combination to properly expose the image. If you fast-
forwarded to this section and don’t understand how your camera determines 
shutter speed and exposure, check out the “Understanding how exposure 
works in the camera” section earlier in this chapter. To manually expose your 
images:
 
1. Rotate the Mode dial to M (see 
Figure 6-11) and then rotate 
the Main dial to set the shutter 
speed.
 
 The shutter speed determines 
how long the shutter stays open. 
A slow shutter speed is perfect 
for a scene with low light. A fast 
shutter speed freezes action. As 
you change the shutter speed, 
review the exposure indicator 
in the LCD panel, or if you have 
the shutter button pressed half-
way, in the viewfinder. When the 
exposure is correct for the light-
ing conditions, the exposure 
level mark aligns with the center 
of the scale. If the exposure level 
mark is to the right of center, the image will 
be overexposed (see Figure 6-12). If to the 
left of center, the image will be underex-
posed. Of course, you’re in control. You may 
want to intentionally overexpose or underex-
pose for special effects. For example, if you 
slightly underexpose the image, the colors 
will be more saturated.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to set the 
f-stop value.
Figure 6-11: Manually exposing the image.
Figure 6-12: Monitor the 
exposure in the LCD panel.

120
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
 The f-stop value determines how much light enters the camera. A small 
f-stop value, such as f/2.8, lets a lot of light into the camera and also 
gives a shallow depth of field. A large f-stop value lets a small amount of 
light into the camera and gives you a large depth of field. As you change 
the f-stop value, review the exposure indicator in the LCD panel, or if 
you have the shutter button pressed halfway, in the viewfinder. When 
the exposure is correct for the lighting conditions, the exposure level 
mark aligns with the center of the scale. If the exposure level mark is to 
the right of the center, the image will be overexposed. If to the left of 
center, the image will be underexposed.
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears in the viewfinder when the camera has achieved 
focus. If the dot is flashing, the camera can’t achieve focus and you must 
focus manually.
 
4. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
Shooting time exposures
When you switch to Bulb mode, the shutter stays open as long as you press 
the shutter button. If you’ve ever seen night pictures in which you can actu-
ally see trails from stars that follow the curvature of the earth, you’ve seen 
a photograph that was taken with the Bulb mode. The photographer left the 
shutter open for a long period of 
time, and the earth rotated while 
the photograph was taken. These 
types of images are known as time 
exposures because the image was 
exposed over a long period of time. 
To shoot time exposures:
 
1. Mount the camera on a tripod.
 
 The lens will be open for a long 
time. The slightest movement 
will show up as a blur in the 
final image. Unless you want 
the image blurred for a creative 
effect, you need to stabilize the 
camera on a tripod.
 
2. Rotate the Mode dial to B (see 
Figure 6-13).
Figure 6-13: Rotate the Mode dial to B to select 
Bulb mode.

121
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
 
 B means Bulb mode. Back in the old days of film cameras, photogra-
phers would open the shutter with a pneumatic device that looked like a 
bulb. The shutter opened when the photographer squeezed the device 
and remained open until the photographer released his grip.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial or the Main dial to set the f-stop value.
 
 A small f-stop value such as f/2.8 (large aperture) lets a lot of light into 
the camera and gives a shallow depth of field. A large f-stop value (small 
aperture), such as f/16, lets a small amount of light into the camera and 
gives a large depth of field. You also need to leave the shutter open 
longer when using a large f-stop value, which in most instances is desir-
able. However, a longer exposure can add digital noise to the image. 
When you have an exposure that leaves the shutter open for several sec-
onds, or perhaps minutes, use an ISO speed setting of 100 to minimize 
digital noise.
 
4. Connect a remote switch to the camera.
 
 If you hold the shutter button open with your finger, you’ll transmit 
vibrations to the camera, which yields a blurry image. A remote switch, 
such as the Canon RS-80N3, or a remote timer and switch, such as the 
Canon TC-80N3, triggers the shutter remotely and no vibration is trans-
mitted to the camera. Both plug into a port on the side of your camera 
(see Figure 6-14).
 
5. Press the button on 
the remote switch to 
open the shutter.
 
 The shutter remains 
open as long as you 
hold the button. The 
time is noted in the 
LCD panel.
 
6. Release the button 
on the remote 
switch to close the 
shutter.
 
7. Review the image on 
your LCD monitor.
 
 I find it useful to take 
one picture, note 
the time the lens remained open, and examine the image carefully on 
the LCD monitor. If I’m not pleased, I take another shot, leaving the lens 
open longer if the test image is underexposed or for a shorter duration if 
the test image is overexposed.
Insert remote switch here.
Figure 6-14: Attach a Canon remote switch.

122
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Time exposures can be a lot of fun. You can use them to record artistic depic-
tions of headlight patterns on a curved stretch of road (see Figure 6-15) or 
capture the motion of the ocean at night. The possibilities are limited only by 
your imagination.
Figure 6-15: A time exposure that records headlight trails at night.
Modifying Camera Exposure
Your camera has a built-in metering device that automatically determines the 
proper shutter speed and aperture to create a perfectly exposed image for 
most lighting scenarios. However, at times, you need to modify the exposure 
to suit the current lighting conditions. Modify camera exposure for individual 
shots, or hedge your bets and create several exposures of each shot. You can 
also lock focus and exposure to a specific location in the scene you’re photo-
graphing. I show you how to achieve these tasks in the upcoming sections.

123
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
Using exposure compensation
When your camera gets the exposure right, it’s a wonderful thing. At times, 
however, the camera doesn’t get it right. When you review an image on the 
camera LCD monitor and it’s not exposed to suit your taste, you can compen-
sate manually by increasing or decreasing exposure. To manually compen-
sate camera exposure:
 
1. Choose P, Av, or Tv from the 
Mode dial (see Figure 6-16).
 
 Exposure compensation is 
available only when you take 
pictures with Programmed Auto 
Exposure, Aperture Priority, or 
Shutter Priority mode.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
while holding the shutter 
button halfway.
 
 Rotate the dial counterclock-
wise to decrease exposure or 
clockwise to increase exposure. 
As you rotate the dial, you see 
the exposure indicator in the 
viewfinder and LCD panel move, 
which shows you the amount of 
exposure compensation you’re 
applying (see Figure 6-17).
 
3. Press the shutter button fully 
to take the picture.
 
4. To cancel exposure compensa-
tion, press the shutter button 
halfway and rotate the Quick 
Control dial until the exposure 
indicator is in the center of the 
exposure compensation scale.
 
 You see the exposure compen-
sation scale in the viewfinder 
and on the LCD panel.
Figure 6-16: Use exposure compensation with 
these shooting modes.
Figure 6-17: Using exposure compensation.

124
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Exposure compensation stays in effect even after you power off the camera. 
You can inadvertently add exposure compensation by accidentally rotating 
the Quick Control dial when you have the shutter button pressed halfway. 
You can safeguard against this by keeping the Quick Control switch (below 
the Quick Control dial) in the locked position when you don’t need to use the 
Quick Control dial.
Bracketing exposure
When you’re photographing an important event, properly exposed images 
are a must. Many photographers get lazy and don’t feel they need to get it 
right in the camera when they have programs like Photoshop or Photoshop 
Lightroom. However, you get much better results when you process an image 
that’s been exposed correctly. Professional photographers bracket their 
exposures when they photograph important events or places they may never 
visit again. When you bracket an exposure, you take three pictures: one 
with the exposure as metered by the camera, one with exposure that’s been 
decreased, and one with exposure that’s been increased. You can bracket up 
to plus or minus 3 EV (exposure value) in 1⁄3 EV increments. To bracket your 
exposures:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting Settings 2 
tab and then rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Expo.Comp./
AEB (automatic exposure bracketing).
 
 See the left side of Figure 6-18.
 
 
3. Press the Set button.
 
 The Exposure Comp./AEB Setting menu appears.
 
 
4. Rotate the Main dial to set the amount of bracketing.
 
 When you rotate the dial, a new scale appears below the exposure 
compensation scale and a line appears on each side of the center of 
the scale (see the right side of Figure 6-18). Each mark indicates 1/3 
f-stop correction.
 
5. (Optional) Rotate the Quick Control dial to apply exposure compensa-
tion to the settings determined by the camera meter.

125
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
Figure 6-18: Setting automatic exposure bracketing.
 
 This step is optional if you’re comfortable with the way the camera has 
been setting exposure. You can use exposure compensation to increase 
or decrease the exposure metered by the camera. When you add expo-
sure compensation to the mix, the automatic exposure bracketing (AEB) 
marks move as well. In other words, the exposure will be increased and 
decreased relative to the compensated exposure.
 
6. Press Set.
 
 The settings are applied. The Expo.Comp./AEB menu option shows the 
amount of bracketing and exposure compensation you’ve applied. The 
AEB icon appears in the viewfinder and LCD panel (see Figure 6-19).
AEB icon
Figure 6-19: These icons appear after you set AEB.

126
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
 
7. Press the AF-Drive button and rotate the Quick Control dial to choose 
one of the Continuous Drive modes.
 
 When I use AEB, I generally use the low speed Continuous mode.
 
8. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus and then press the 
shutter button fully.
 
 When you press the shutter button, the camera creates three images: 
one with standard exposure, one with decreased exposure, and one with 
increased exposure. To cancel AEB, turn off the camera.
Locking exposure
You can also lock exposure on a specific part of the frame, which is handy 
when you want a specific part of the frame exposed correctly. For example, 
recently I was photographing a beautiful sunset. The camera meter averaged 
the exposure for the scene, and the image ended up with blown-out high-
lights around the sun and clouds that weren’t as dark and colorful as I saw 
them. To compensate for this, I locked exposure on the blue sky, and the pic-
ture turned out perfect. To lock exposure:
 
1. Look through the viewfinder and move 
the camera until the center of the view-
finder is over the area to which you want 
to lock focus.
 
 
2. Press the AE Lock/Index/Reduce button.
 
 The autoexposure lock icon appears in the 
viewfinder (see Figure 6-20).
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway to 
achieve focus.
 
 A green dot in the viewfinder tells you that 
the camera has achieved focus. You also 
see black rectangles that designate the 
areas on which the camera has focused.
 
4. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
Autoexposure lock icon
Figure 6-20: This icon notifies 
that exposure lock is enabled.

127
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
Locking Focus
You can choose from two ways to lock focus on an object that isn’t in the 
center of the frame: the shutter button or the AF-On button. This option 
comes in handy when your center of interest isn’t in the center of the frame.
To lock focus with the shutter button:
 
1. While looking through the viewfinder, move your camera until the 
center of the viewfinder is over the subject that you want the camera 
to lock focus on.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 Make sure that a black autofocus square appears over your subject. 
When I’m photographing people who aren’t in the center of the frame, 
I switch to a single autofocus point that’s in the center of the frame. 
For more information on selecting and modifying autofocus points, see 
Chapter 7. When the camera achieves focus, a green dot appears in the 
viewfinder.
 
3. While holding the shutter button halfway, recompose your picture.
 
4. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
You can also lock focus with the AF-On button on the top of your camera. 
This is a little easier because you don’t have to hold the shutter button half-
way while composing your picture. To lock focus with the AF-On button:
 
1. Look through the viewfinder and move the camera until the center 
of the viewfinder is over the subject that you want the camera to lock 
focus on.
 
 
2. Press the AF-On button.
 
 Red autofocus squares appear momentarily in the viewfinder over the 
subjects that the camera will lock focus on. The squares turn black after 
the camera achieves focus. Make sure the autofocus points that display 
are over the object that you want the camera to lock focus on. I find it 
useful to switch to a single autofocus point in the center of the frame 
when I’m photographing a person or subject that isn’t in the center.
 
3. Move the camera to recompose the picture and then press the shutter 
button fully.
 
 An image appears almost instantaneously on the camera LCD monitor. 
Review the image to make sure the camera locked focus on the desired 
object.

128
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Choosing a Drive Mode
Your camera can capture multiple images when you press the shutter button 
in the CA (Creative Auto), P (Programmed Auto Exposure), Av (Aperture 
Priority), Tv (Shutter Priority), or M (Manual) shooting mode. Your camera 
also has a Hi Speed Continuous mode that captures images at the blindingly 
fast rate of 8 fps, which is ideal for any situation that requires you to capture 
a bunch of images in a short period of time. To specify the Drive mode, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose one of the following shooting modes from the Mode dial: 
CA (Creative Auto), P (Programmed Auto Exposure), Av (Aperture 
Priority), Tv (Shutter Priority), or M (Manual).
 
 When you shoot in Full Auto mode, you can capture only a single shot 
each time you press the shutter button. When you choose Creative 
Auto, you can shoot continuously at the rate of 3 fps. You can capture 
images at up to 8 fps when shooting in one of the other aforementioned 
shooting modes.
 
 
2. Press the AF-Drive button.
 
 
3. Rotate the Main dial while looking at the LCD panel and then choose 
one of the following:
 
• Single Shot: You capture one picture each time you press the shut-
ter button. (See the left side of Figure 6-21.)
 
• Hi Speed Continuous Shooting: You can capture up to 8 fps when 
you press and hold the shutter button. (See the right side of 
Figure 6-21.)
 
• Low Speed Continuous Shooting: You can capture up to 3 fps 
when you press and hold the shutter button. (See the left side 
of Figure 6-22.)
 
• 10-Second Self-Timer/Remote Control: Starts the 10-Second 
Self-Timer when you press the shutter button or trigger the 
shutter with a remote control unit. A light in front of the camera 
beeps and blinks while counting down. At the 2-second mark, 
the light stays on and the beeping is faster. (See the right side of 
Figure 6-22.)
 
• 2-Second Self-Timer/Remote Control: Starts the 2-Second Self-Timer 
when you press the shutter button or trigger the shutter with a 
remote control unit. (See Figure 6-23.)

4. Take some pictures.
 
 The Drive mode you select stays in effect 
until you change it. If you power off the 
camera, the Drive mode still stays in effect. 
Switch back to single shot mode when you no 
longer need to capture images continuously.
 
The 2-Second Self-Timer is ideal when you’re 
photographing with the camera mounted to a 
tripod. The 2-second delay gives the camera a 
chance to stabilize from any vibration that 
occurred when you pressed the shutter button.
Using White Balance Compensation
If you find that images photographed with a custom white balance have 
a colorcast, you can apply compensation to remove that colorcast. This 
is pretty advanced stuff, so unless you know a lot about color correction,

color temperatures, and so on, stick to AWB (auto white balance) and do 
any necessary color correction in your favorite image-editing application. 
But if you’re dying to know what it’s all about, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting Settings 2 
tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight WB Shift/BKT (see the left 
side of Figure 6-24) and then press the Set button.
Figure 6-24: Correcting a custom white balance.
 
 The White Balance Correction dialog box appears (see the right side of 
Figure 6-24). Notice there are four letters: one at the center top (G for 
green), one at the center bottom (M for magenta), one at the left center 
(B for blue), and one at the right center (A for amber).
 
4. Use the multi-controller button 
to move the dot.
 
 You can move the dot toward 
one color and then move it up 
or down to shift the white bal-
ance toward a combination of 
amber and green. When you 
move the dot, the color shift 
is designated in the dialog box 
(see Figure 6-25). In this case, 
the white balance has been 
shifted two levels toward amber 
and two levels toward magenta.

 Each level represents five mirids of a color 
correction filter.
 
5. Press Set.
 
 Your changes are applied.

button and then rotate the Quick Control 
dial to select Custom White Balance.
 
 The custom white balance icon displays 
on the LCD panel (see Figure 6-26).
 
7. Press the shutter button fully to take a picture.
 
 The color shift is applied to your custom white balance. The colorcast is 
no more, quoth the raven.
 
To remove white balance compensation, repeat the preceding Steps 1–3 and 
then press the Info button.
Bracketing White Balance
If you’re the type of photographer who likes to hedge her bets, you may con-
sider using white balance bracketing. When you use white balance, you end 
up with three images: one with your custom white balance setting, and two 
that have color shifts applied to them. You can also apply a white balance 
correction to your custom white balance, which will be the new custom white 
balance. To bracket a custom white balance:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting 
Settings 2 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight WB Shift/BKT (see the left 
side of Figure 6-27) and then press the Set button.
 
 The White Balance Correction/Bracketing dialog box appears (see the 
right side of Figure 6-27).

Using Custom Functions
Your camera has almost as many custom functions as there are Smiths in the 
New York City phone book. Well almost. At any rate, I find some custom func-
tions extremely useful. In fact, I’ve already covered a couple custom func-
tions in earlier chapters. Unfortunately, I’d have to buy my project editor a 
year’s supply of her favorite hair-coloring product if I covered every custom 
function. In the upcoming sections, I cover the custom functions I think are 
most important. I leave it to you, dear reader, to explore the other custom 
functions when the weather’s not conducive to photography. But then again, 
when the weather’s bad, you may prefer to try some still-life photography on 
common household items instead of exploring custom functions.
Exploring Exposure custom functions
You can choose from seven custom functions to modify exposure. I cover 
one — C.Fn I: Exposure — in Chapter 7. Other functions enable you to change 
exposure and ISO increments, but the default settings are just fine. One 
useful custom function is Safety Shift. When you shoot in Aperture Priority 
or Shutter Priority mode, this function shifts the exposure instantly if the 
lighting changes dramatically and the subject gets considerably brighter or 
darker. Here’s how to enable it:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom Functions 
tab.
 
 C.Fn I: Exposure is first on the hit parade (see the left side of Figure 6-29) 
unless you’ve dabbled with another custom function previously.
 
 
3. If C.Fn I: Exposure is not highlighted, rotate the Quick Control dial to 
highlight the option and then press the Set button.
 
 The Exposure custom functions display.
 
4. Press the multi-controller button until 6 appears in the window on the 
right side of the dialog box and then press Set.
 
 The default Safety Shift option displays (see the right side of Figure 6-29).

134
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Figure 6-29: The Safety Shift options.
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Enable and press Set.
 
 The custom function is highlighted in blue and remains in effect until 
you disable it.
Exploring Image custom functions
Several custom functions determine what your resulting image looks like. The 
first two options are for noise reduction. The following looks at each option 
in detail:
 
✓ C.Fn II: Image Long Exp. Noise Reduction is off by default. However, if 
you take pictures with lots of long exposures, you can choose to have 
this applied automatically when the camera detects noise or leave it on 
all the time.
 
✓ C.Fn II: Image High ISO Noise Speed Reduction determines how noise 
reduction is applied to your images. The following are options that you 
can choose from:
 
• Standard: This is the default option for all images.
 
• Strong: If you do a lot of shooting at high ISO speeds, you may find 
this option better suited for your photography.
 
• Low and Disable: The other options are Low and Disable; the 
former provides low noise reduction, and the latter disables noise 
reduction for all images.
 
 I haven’t performed extensive tests on these options. Change these 
custom functions at your discretion and with however many grains 
of salt you choose.

135
 Chapter 6: Getting the Most from Your Camera
 
✓ C.Fn II: Image Highlight Tone Priority is very useful if you do a lot of 
photography in bright conditions. In essence, the camera gives priority 
to the bright parts of your image, which prevents them from being over-
exposed. It also extends the dynamic range.
To enable C.Fn II: Image Highlight Tone Priority:
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom 
Functions tab.
 
 The last used custom function option is highlighted.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight C.Fn II: Image (see the left 
side of Figure 6-30) and then press the Set button.
 
 The Image custom functions display.
 
4. Press the multi-controller button until the number 3 appears in the 
window and then press Set.
 
 The default Highlight Tone Priority Disable option is highlighted (see the 
right side of Figure 6-30).
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Enable and press Set.
 
 The option is displayed in blue. Highlight Tone Priority is in effect until 
you disable the option or reset all custom functions.
Figure 6-30: Enabling the Highlight Tone Priority custom function.

136
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
You can’t use ISO expansion when Highlight Tone Priority is enabled. With 
this custom function, you’re limited to an ISO range from 200 to 6400.
Exploring Autofocus/Drive custom functions
You can use this set of custom functions to modify how the camera handles 
autofocus, point display, and so on. I’ve reviewed these options — all 13 of 
them — extensively and found that the default options are excellent in most 
cases. The Mirror Lockup custom function is useful if you use a long tele-
photo lens. (I discuss this option in Chapter 8.) One option I do find useful for 
wildlife photographers is the manner in which the camera tracks a moving 
object in AI Servo autofocus mode (flip to Chapter 8 for this as well).
Customizing Your Camera
Many of the buttons on your camera can be customized to perform differ-
ent takes. For example, you can change the task the shutter button performs 
when you press it halfway. Ten buttons on the camera are customizable. 
You may find it useful to customize some of these buttons. Instead of going 
through a long, boring Niagara Falls, slowly-I-turn, step-by-step dissertation 
on how each button can be customized, I point you in the right direction 
with this short tutorial. Exploring each option for each button is another 
good rainy day project. If it’s still rainy at night, shoot some reflections of 
city streets. Just make sure you’re under cover when you do it so you don’t 
damage your camera. To customize the buttons on your camera:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom Functions 
tab.
 
 The last used custom function option is highlighted.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the Custom Functions tab.
 
 The last used custom functions option is highlighted.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight C.Fn IV: Operations/Others 
(see the left side of Figure 6-31).

5. Press the Set button.
 
 The C.Fn IV: Operations/Others custom functions display. Custom 
Controls is the first option (see the right side of Figure 6-31). As you 
can see, you can customize quite a few buttons. The default option is 
displayed to the right of the button. For example, the default task per-
formed by the shutter button when pressed halfway is achieving focus 
automatically. The following steps show you how to customize the 
button. The steps are similar for the other customizable buttons.
 
6. Press Set.
 
 The top of the camera is displayed next to the buttons that can be 
customized (see the left side of Figure 6-32).
 
7. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the button you want to 
customize. For this exercise, leave the shutter button highlighted.
 
 When you highlight a customizable button, a dark orange rectangle sur-
rounds it. As you select different buttons, the button is highlighted on 
the camera. The camera view also changes when you highlight a button 
that’s on the front or back of the camera.
 
8. After you highlight a button, press Set.
 
 The options for the button display. The right side of Figure 6-32 shows 
the options for the shutter button. The default task for the button is 
highlighted with an orange border.

to finish customizing camera buttons.
 
11. Press the Menu button when you’ve finished customizing buttons.
Clearing Custom Functions
Enabling custom functions and customizing your camera can be quite 
useful. However, sometimes you get carried away and go over the top. 
Other times you’ve experimented with a bunch of custom functions and 
decide they no longer suit your style of photography. You can wipe out all 
the custom functions and any changes you’ve applied to camera buttons by 
doing the following:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom Functions 
tab.
 
 The last used custom function option is highlighted.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the Custom Functions tab.

our camera is the next step in digital photography 
technology: It has lots of features that enable you 
to take great pictures. When you shoot in one of the 
creative modes, you can modify lots of things. If the 
light is a bit dim and you don’t feel like flashing 
your subject, you can increase the ISO speed set-
ting. You can also change the autofocus system to 
suit your taste and the type of photography you do. 
You can also change the way the camera meters 
the scene before you. In short, the sky’s the limit 
when you employ the advanced features of your 
camera. 
To bring you up to speed on all the advanced features you 
can use, read the sections in this chapter in which I show you 
how to harness all the cool features.

Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Viewing Battery Information
Your camera provides gobs of useful information about pictures and camera 
settings. You also have a smart battery powering your EOS 7D. For instance, 
you can access information about how much charge is left in your battery, 
how many shutter actuations have occurred since you inserted it, and the 
battery’s condition. View the battery information on your LCD monitor. To 
check your battery’s condition:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera Settings 3 
tab (see the left side of Figure 7-1).
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Battery Info and then press 
the Set button.
 
 The following battery information displays (see the right side of 
Figure 7-1):
Figure 7-1: Displaying battery information.
 
• Model: Displays the battery model or household power source 
being used to power the camera.
 
• Remaining Cap.: Displays the remaining power capacity in 1 per-
cent increments.

143
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
 
• Shutter Count: Displays the number of shutter actuations for the 
current battery. When a recharged battery is inserted, the count 
resets to zero.
 
• Recharge Performance: Displays the recharge performance. Three 
green squares indicate excellent recharging performance, two green 
squares indicate the recharging performance is slightly degraded, 
and one red square indicates poor performance. When you see one 
red square, think about replacing the battery.
 
4. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re ready to take pictures.
Using the Auto Lighting Optimizer
If you capture images in JPEG mode, you can invoke a menu command that 
gives you better-looking images when you’re shooting in dark conditions. 
Instead of getting a shot with too much contrast, you end up with a brighter 
shot. This option may add digital noise to the image. Digital noise comes in 
two flavors: 
 
✓ Color: Shows up as specks of color.
 
✓ Luminance: Shows up as random gray clumps.
Digital noise is most prevalent in areas of solid color, such as the dark 
shadow areas in your image. If you shoot images in the RAW format, you can 
adjust image brightness with Canon’s Digital Photo Professional. To enable 
the Auto Lighting Optimizer:
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting Settings 
2 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Auto Lighting Optimizer 
(see the left side of Figure 7-2) and then press Set.
 
 The Auto Lighting Optimizer menu displays (see the right side of 
Figure 7-2).

144
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Figure 7-2: Selecting the Auto Lighting Optimizer.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight one of the following 
options:
 
• Standard: The default option adjusts the lighting to create a picture 
that brightens backlit subjects.
 
• Low: This option adds a minimal amount of brightness to a backlit 
subject.
 
• Strong: This option adds a considerable amount of brightness to a 
backlit subject.
 
• Disable: Brightness and contrast isn’t corrected when photograph-
ing backlit subjects.
 
 When you pause the Quick Control dial over an option, it turns blue and 
the name displays above the icons.
 
5. Press Set.
 
 The change is applied, and you return to the Shooting Settings 2 tab.
 
6. Press the shutter button halfway to return to take pictures.
 
 The Auto Lighting Optimizer setting you choose remains in effect until 
you select a different option. In some cases, digital noise may be appar-
ent when the Auto Lighting Optimizer is used.
Correcting Lens Peripheral Illumination
Some lenses have a problem with light falloff toward the edge of the frame. 
If you’ve ever taken a picture and noticed that the edges of the image were 
dark, you’ve experienced this phenomenon firsthand. The amount of light 

145
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
falloff depends on the lens you’re using. You can, however, go a long way 
toward correcting this problem with a camera menu command. This feature 
is available only for Canon lenses. The peripheral illumination data is stored 
in the camera’s database. To enable peripheral illumination:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller to navigate to the Shooting Settings 1 tab (see 
the left side of Figure 7-3).
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Peripheral Illumin. Correct 
and then press the Set button.
 
 The Peripheral Illumin. Correct options display (see the right side of 
Figure 7-3). If you have a Canon lens attached to the camera and data 
for the lens is in the camera’s database, this information is noted in the 
dialog box. If a third-party lens is attached to the camera, a message 
appears telling you correction data isn’t available.
Figure 7-3: Enabling Lens Peripheral Illumination Correction.
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Enable and then press Set.
 
 After using this command, your camera automatically corrects for any 
lens that has problems with light falloff at the edge of the frame. This 
option’s effectiveness depends on the lens used, the f-stop, and the light-
ing conditions.
 
5. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re ready to start shooting with Lens Peripheral Illumination 
Correction enabled.

146
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Choosing a Metering Mode
When you press the shutter button halfway, your camera meters the scene 
you photograph to determine the optimal exposure settings. The default 
metering mode (Evaluative) works well for most lighting conditions. When 
you shoot in Full Auto or Creative Auto mode, the Evaluative metering 
mode is used. To change the metering mode to suit different lighting and 
picture-taking situations:
 
 
1. Press the Metering Mode/White Balance button on the top of your 
camera.
 
 This button is in front of the LCD panel and to the left when you point 
the camera toward your subject.
 
 
2. Rotate the Main dial to choose one of the following metering options:
 
 
• Evaluative: This is the default mode for your camera. You can use 
this mode for most of your work, including backlit scenes. The 
camera divides the scene into several zones and evaluates the 
brightness of the scene, direct light, and backlighting, factoring 
these variables to create the correct exposure for your subject.
 
 
• Partial: This mode meters a small area in the center of the scene. 
This option is useful when the background is much brighter than 
your subject. A perfect example of this is a beach scene at sunset 
when you’re pointing the camera toward the sun and your subject 
is in front of you.
 
 
• Center-Weighted Average: This metering mode meters the entire 
scene, but gives more importance to the subject in the center. Use 
this mode when one part of your scene is significantly brighter 
than the rest; for example, when the sun is in the picture. If your 
bright light source is near the center of the scene, this mode pre-
vents it from being overexposed.
 
 
• Spot: This mode meters a small area in the center of the scene. Use 
this mode when your subject is in the center and is significantly 
brighter than the rest of your scene. Your camera may have the 
option to spot-meter where the autofocus frame is. If your camera 
can move the autofocus frame to your subject, you can accurately 
spot-meter a subject that isn’t in the center of the frame.

147
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
Displaying the Grid
The grid is a visual reference that appears in your camera monitor. Use the 
vertical and horizontal lines on the grid to ensure your camera is straight. 
When the gridlines are aligned with lines in the scene that you know should be 
vertical or horizontal, the resulting image looks correct. To display the grid:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last used menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera Settings 2 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight VF Grid Display (see the left 
side of Figure 7-4).
 
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 The VF Grid Display options display in the camera LCD monitor (see the 
right side of Figure 7-4).

5. Rotate the Quick Control 
dial to highlight Enable and 
press Set.
 
 The option text is highlighted 
in blue.
 
6. Press the shutter button 
halfway.
 
 You’re ready to take pictures 
with the grid displayed in your 
viewfinder (see Figure 7-5).
Figure 7-5: Using the VF Grid Display.

148
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Using the Electronic Level
The electronic level enables you to take pictures with your camera level and 
plumb. This ensures that the camera isn’t tilted right or left, or up or down. 
The end result is you get images that look correct and not like they were pho-
tographed by a drunken sailor. When you’re not shooting in Live View mode, 
the electronic level is most useful when you have the camera mounted on a 
tripod. To display the electronic level on your LCD monitor:
 
1. Mount your camera on a tripod.
 
 You can also use the electronic level when handholding the camera. 
However, it’s more difficult to get accurate results, and you can’t hold 
the camera as steady because it’s away from your body.
 
 
2. Press the Info button twice.
 
 The electronic level displays on your LCD monitor. The left side of 
Figure 7-6 shows what the level looks like when the camera isn’t level 
horizontally and not plumb.
 
3. Adjust the legs of your tripod until a solid green line appears in the 
center of the level.
 
 This tells you the camera is level and plumb (see the right side of 
Figure 7-6).
Figure 7-6: A level camera is a wonderful thing.
Choosing the Autofocus Mode
Your camera focuses automatically on objects that intersect autofocus 
points. You have three autofocus modes on your camera. One is ideally 
suited for still objects, and another is ideally suited for objects that are 

149
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
moving. You have yet a third autofocus mode, which is chameleon; you use it 
for still objects that may move. To choose an autofocus mode:
 
 
1. Press the AF-Drive button on top of your camera and directly in front 
of the LCD panel.
 
 Figure 7-7 shows the LCD panel 
as it appears when you’re using 
One-Shot mode.
 
 
2. Rotate the Main dial while 
viewing the LCD panel to select 
one of the following autofocus 
modes:
 
• One-Shot: Use this autofo-
cus mode for objects that 
don’t move. It’s ideally 
suited for shooting portraits and landscapes.
 
• AI Focus: Use this autofocus mode for objects that are stationary 
but may begin to move. The camera locks focus using One-Shot 
but switches to AI Servo if the subject starts moving. This option 
is ideally suited for macro photography of objects like flowers on a 
windy day. Figure 7-8 shows the LCD panel when you’re shooting in 
AI Focus mode.
 
• AI Servo: Use this autofo-
cus mode for objects in 
motion. After the camera 
locks focus on the object, 
the camera updates the 
focus as the subject moves. 
This mode is ideally suited 
for objects that are moving 
toward or away from you. 
Figure 7-9 shows the LCD 
panel when you’re shoot-
ing in AI Servo mode.
 
None of the autofocus modes are 
effective on fast-moving objects, 
such as racecars or airplanes. To 
capture blur-free shots of objects 
like these that move toward or away 
from you, switch the lens to manual 
focus and then focus on a spot your

subject will cross. Press the shutter button shortly before your subject 
reaches the point on which you have focused. The amount of time varies 
depending on how fast your subject is moving.
Using the M-Fn Button to 
Change Autofocus Points
The M-Fn button makes it possible to switch between autofocus point 
modes. The default autofocus mode uses 19 points to determine autofocus. 
You can switch to a single autofocus point when you need the camera to 
focus on a specific point in the frame. You can also switch to an autofocus 
zone that uses several autofocus points within a zone. I cover the 
single-point autofocus and zone autofocus in upcoming sections. However, 
I familiarize you with the M-Fn button here so you can switch between the 
default autofocus mode to zone or 
single autofocus zones at Will — 
whoever he was. To switch between 
autofocus point selection modes:
 
 
1. Press the AF Point Selection/
Magnify button.
 
 
2. While looking in the view-
finder, press the M-Fn button.
 
 The default autofocus mode 
with 19 autofocus points dis-
plays in your viewfinder (see 
Figure 7-10).
 
3. Press the M-Fn button again.
 
 The autofocus mode that 
enables you to select a single 
autofocus point displays in your 
viewfinder (see Figure 7-11).
 
4. Press the M-Fn button again.
Figure 7-11: Selecting a single autofocus point.
Figure 7-10: The default autofocus points.

151
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
 
 The display changes to reflect 
zone autofocus points (see 
Figure 7-12).
Changing the Autofocus 
Point
By default, your camera displays 
19 autofocus points. The camera 
focuses on subjects that intersect 
these grid points. The default 
number of autofocus points works 
fine for most picture-taking situa-
tions. However, at times, it makes sense to switch to a single autofocus point 
that you align with a single object. This option is useful when you want to 
focus selectively on a single subject in a scene that has other objects that the 
camera may lock focus on. Your camera also has the option to switch to an 
autofocus group. To change the autofocus point:
 
 
1. Press the AF Point Selection/Magnify button.
 
 
2. While looking at the viewfinder, press the M-Fn button until you see 
a single autofocus point in the center surrounded by several smaller 
points.
 
 This indicates the other possible points on which you can focus from.
 
 
3. Press the multi-controller 
button to navigate to the 
desired autofocus point.
 
 You can navigate to any of the 
autofocus targets (the small 
red squares) to designate the 
point from which the camera 
will focus. Figure 7-13 shows 
one of the side autofocus points 
selected. The camera focuses 
on an object under that autofo-
cus point.
Figure 7-12: Selecting zone autofocus.
Figure 7-13: Choosing an autofocus point.

152
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
4. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re ready to take pictures with a single autofocus point. The auto-
focus point is the default autofocus point until you use the AF Point 
Selection/Magnify button to designate another autofocus point, or you 
use the AF Point Selection/Magnify button in conjunction with the M-Fn 
button to select the default autofocus or zone autofocus option.
Using Zone Autofocus
Zone autofocus lets you use several autofocus points that are in a zone. The 
camera focuses on any object that’s directly beneath an autofocus point in 
the zone you specify. The camera has five autofocus zones located in the 
following areas: left side with four autofocus points, top center with four 
autofocus points, middle with nine autofocus points, bottom center with four 
autofocus points, and right side with four autofocus points. I find the middle 
zone is great for many picture-taking tasks, including portrait photography. 
To choose an autofocus zone:
 
 
1. Press the AF Point Selection/Magnify button.
 
 
2. While looking at the view-
finder, press the M-Fn button 
until you see nine autofocus 
points in the center sur-
rounded by two brackets.
 
 This is the middle autofocus 
zone.
 
 
3. Press the multi-controller 
button to select the desired 
autofocus zone.
 
 Figure 7-14 shows the top 
center autofocus zone selected. 
The zone you select remains 
in effect until you change it or 
switch to the default display.
Choosing a Picture Style
When you photograph a scene or image, your camera sensor captures the 
colors and subtle nuances of shadow and light to create a faithful rendition 
of the scene. At times, however, you want a different type of picture. For 
Figure 7-14: Choosing an autofocus zone.

153
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
example, when you’re photographing a landscape, you want vivid blues and 
greens in the image. You can choose from a variety of picture styles and 
create up to three custom picture styles. When you take pictures in Full Auto 
mode, this option isn’t available. To choose a picture style:
 
 
1. Press the Picture Style button.
 
 The Picture Style options appear 
on your LCD monitor. Figure 7-15 
shows the Standard picture style.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
to choose one of the following 
styles:
 
• Standard: The default 
style captures crisp, 
sharp images and is suit-
able for most photogra-
phy situations.
 
• Portrait: This style renders a soft image with flattering skin tones. 
This style is ideally suited for portraits of women and children.
 
• Landscape: This style renders an image with vivid blues and greens. 
Landscape is ideally suited for — you guessed it — landscapes. I 
love truth in advertising.
 
• Neutral: This style renders an image with no in-camera enhance-
ment and is ideally suited for photographers who will be editing 
and enhancing their images with a computer image-editing applica-
tion, such as Photoshop or Photoshop Lightroom. The resulting 
image has natural colors.
 
• Faithful: This is another style ideally suited for photographers who 
like to edit their images with a computer image-editing application. 
When you photograph a subject in daylight with a color tempera-
ture of 5200K, the camera automatically adjusts the image color to 
match the color of your subject.
 
• Monochrome: This style creates a black and white image. If you use 
this style and choose JPEG as the file format, you can’t convert the 
image to color with your computer. If you use this style when using 
the JPEG format, make sure you switch back to one of the other 
picture styles when you want to capture images with color again.
 
• User-Created Styles: These slots are for styles you’ve created. I 
show you how to create custom picture styles in Chapter 11.

 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
Specifying the Color Space
Several color spaces are used in photography and image-editing applications. 
The color space determines the range of colors you have to work with. The 
default color space (sRGB) in your camera is ideal if you’re not editing your 
images in an application like Photoshop or Photoshop Lightroom. However, if 
you do edit your images in an image-editing application and want the widest 
range of colors (also known as gamut) with which to work, you can specify 
Adobe RGB. To specify the color space that your camera records images 
with, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting Settings 2 
tab (see the left side of Figure 7-17).
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Color Space and then press 
the Set button.
 
 The Color Space menu displays (see the right side of Figure 7-17).
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight one of the following:
 
• sRGB: The default color space is ideal if you don’t edit your images 
or do minimal editing.
 
• Adobe RGB: Use this color space if you’re editing your images in an 
application, such as Photoshop or Photoshop Lightroom.
Figure 7-17: Choosing a color space.

156
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
5. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You exit the menu and are ready to shoot pictures with your desired 
color space.
 
After you edit images that were created with the Adobe RGB color space, you 
must convert them to sRGB in your image-editing application before printing 
them or displaying them on the Web. For more information, see a For Dummies 
book about the software application you’re using to edit your work.
Setting White Balance
The human eye can see the color white without a colorcast no matter what 
type of light the white object is illuminated with. Your digital camera has to 
balance the lighting in order for white to appear as white in the captured 
image. Without white balance, images photographed with fluorescent light 
have a green colorcast and images photographed with tungsten light sources 
have a yellow/orange colorcast. Yup, your subject would be “green around 
the gills,” or have some other ghastly colorcast, depending on the light 
sources used to illuminate the scene.
Your camera automatically sets the white balance, or you can choose a white 
balance setting to suit the scene you’re photographing. You can also change 
white balance when you want to create an image with some special effects. If 
you shoot images with the RAW format and inadvertently choose the wrong 
white balance setting or your camera doesn’t get it right, you can change 
the white balance setting in an application like Photoshop or Canon’s Digital 
Photo Professional. To set white balance:
 
 
1. Press the Metering Mode/
White Balance button.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
while looking at your LCD 
panel (see Figure 7-18) and 
choose one of the following 
white balance options:
Figure 7-18: Choosing a white balance option.

 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
 
• Auto White Balance: The camera automatically sets the white 
balance based on the lighting conditions.
 
• Daylight: Use this option when photographing subjects on a bright, 
sunny day.
 
• Shade: Use this option when photographing subjects in shaded 
conditions.
 
• Cloudy: Use this option when photographing subjects on a cloudy 
day.
 
• Tungsten: Use this option when photographing subjects illuminated 
by tungsten light.
 
• White Fluorescent: Use this option when photographing subjects 
illuminated by fluorescent lights.
 
• Flash: Use this option when photographing subjects with the 
on-camera flash or an auxiliary flash unit.
 
• Custom: Use when creating a custom white balance. See the 
“Creating a Custom White Balance” section later in this chapter.
 
• K: Use when using a color temperature specified with a menu com-
mand. See the next section, “Specifying Color Temperature.” 
Specifying Color Temperature
If you use studio lighting, you can set the color temperature to the same 
temperature as the light emitted from your strobes. Color temperature is 
measured on the Kelvin scale. You can easily set the color temperature for 
the camera white balance to match the color temperature of your studio 
lights with a menu command. To specify a color temperature:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting 
Settings 2 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight White Balance (see the left 
side of Figure 7-19) and then press the Set button.
 
 The White Balance menu appears on the LCD monitor.

158
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight K and then rotate the Main 
dial to specify the color temperature (see the right side of Figure 7-19).
Figure 7-19: Specifying the color temperature.
 
 The K white balance icon 
appears on the LCD panel (see 
Figure 7-20), and the specified 
color temperature is used when-
ever you choose the K option 
for white balance.
Creating a Custom 
White Balance
When you photograph a scene that’s illuminated with several different light 
sources, your camera may have a hard time figuring out how to set the white 
balance. And if the camera has a hard time, chances are you can’t use one 
of the presets to accurately set the white balance. You can, however, set a 
custom white balance by following these steps:
 
1. Photograph a white object.
 
 Photograph the object under the light source that will be used to illumi-
nate your scene. Photograph something that’s pure white, such as a sheet 
of paper without lines. You won’t get accurate results if you photograph 
Figure 7-20: Using the K white balance mode.

159
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
something that’s off-white. You’ll also get better results if you use the 
Neutral picture style. If you use the Monochrome picture style, you can’t 
obtain a white balance reading. 
 
 Note: Some papers contain optical brighteners. If you use one of those 
to set your white balance, your images may be a little warmer (more 
reddish-orange in color) than normal.
 
 You can purchase an 18-percent gray card from your favorite camera 
retailer and use this in place of a white object in Step 1. The 18-percent 
gray card gives you extremely accurate results.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting Settings 
2 tab and then rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Custom WB 
(see the left side of Figure 7-21).
 
 
3. Press the Set button.
 
 The image you just photographed displays onscreen (see the right side 
of Figure 7-21).
 
4. Press Set.
 
 A dialog box appears asking you to confirm that you want to use the 
image to set the white balance (see the left side of Figure 7-22).
 
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight OK and press Set.
 
 The camera calculates the color temperature for the light source. After 
the camera completes the calculation, a dialog box appears asking you 
whether you want to assign the color temperature derived from the 
calculation to the custom white balance setting (see the right side of 
Figure 7-22).

6. Rotate the Quick Control dial to select OK and then press Set.
 
 
7. When the menu reappears, press the Menu button to exit the Custom 
White Balance menu and then press the Metering Mode/White 
Balance button.
 
8. While viewing the LCD panel, 
rotate the Quick Control dial to 
select Custom White Balance 
(appears in a rounded rectangle 
on the left side of Figure 7-23).
 
 Your custom white balance is 
used to determine white bal-
ance until you select a different 
white balance option.
The custom white balance remains in effect and is used whenever you select 
the Custom White Balance option. You can register only one custom white 
balance. When you encounter a different lighting scenario that requires a 
custom white balance, repeat these steps.
Setting the ISO Speed
The ISO speed determines how sensitive your camera sensor is to light. 
When you specify a high ISO speed, you can capture images when in dark 
conditions. When you specify a high ISO speed, you run the risk of adding 
digital noise to your images. When you specify a higher ISO speed, you also 
extend the range of the camera flash. To change the ISO speed:
Figure 7-23: Creating a custom white balance.

161
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
 
 
1. Press the ISO/Flash Compensation button.
 
 
2. Rotate the Main dial to specify the ISO setting while viewing the LCD 
panel to see the settings as you rotate the dial.
 
 The default ISO for the camera is 
A (Automatic). You can choose 
an ISO setting from 100 to 6400 
or use the extended ISO range 
(see the following section, 
“Extending the ISO Range”). 
Figure 7-24 shows the LCD panel 
after setting the ISO to 640.
Extending the ISO Range
Your camera has an ISO range from 100 to 6400. However, if you take pic-
tures in very dark places and don’t want to use flash, you can extend the ISO 
range to 12800. This setting creates digital noise in shadow areas. Before 
deciding whether the extended ISO range is useful for your photography, I 
suggest taking some test shots with this setting at night in an area that has 
lights and areas of complete shadow. Examine the images on your computer 
and zoom to 100-percent magnification. Pan to areas with lots of shadow 
and look for evidence of digital noise, which will show up as clumps of 
gray (luminance noise) or random areas of colored specks (color noise). To 
extend the ISO range:
 
 
1. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom Functions 
tab.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight c.Fn I: Exposure (see the left 
side of Figure 7-25) and press the Set button.
 
 The Exposure custom function displays.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight down until the number 4 
appears in the window at the top of your LCD panel and then press Set.
 
 The Exposure ISO Expansion menu displays (see the right side of 
Figure 7-25).
 
4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight On and then press Set.
 
 The text turns to blue, and ISO expansion is enabled.

5. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re ready to shoot with ISO expansion enabled. This option appears 
as the letter H when setting the ISO speed with the Main dial.
Flash Photography and Your EOS 7D
Your camera is equipped with a popup flash, a very intelligent popup flash. 
When you take pictures in Full Auto mode, the flash pops up when the 
camera determines that not enough light is available to properly expose the 
scene. When you photograph in Creative Auto mode, you can determine how 
the flash is used (see Chapter 2). When you take pictures using the creative 
modes I discuss in Chapter 6, you have full control over how the flash is 
used. In the upcoming sections, I show you how to use the flash unit that’s 
built into your camera, how to use auxiliary flash units, and how to modify 
the amount of light your flash unit delivers.
Using the built-in flash (high speed sync)
When you shoot in Full Auto mode, pop goes the flash unit when the camera 
decides extra light is needed to properly expose the scene. You also have 
a handy little button on the side of the camera with an icon that looks like 
a lightning bolt; this is how you make the flash pop up when you decide it’s 
needed. To use your flash in Full Auto mode, you don’t have to do anything 
because the flash is fully automatic. When you take pictures in Creative Auto 
mode and accept the default Auto Firing option, the flash pops up when the 

163
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
camera determines additional light is needed to properly expose the image. 
If you choose the Flash On option, the flash pops up when you press the 
shutter button. The popup flash can be used to illuminate a scene or fill in 
the shadows. Popup flash also comes in handy when you want to warm up 
an image. The flowers in the top image of Figure 7-26 were taken with the 
ambient light. The flowers on the bottom of Figure 7-26 were illuminated with 
ambient light and then filled from the popup flash.
Figure 7-26: Spritzing flowers with fill flash.

164
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
To use your popup flash:
 
 
1. Press the Flash button.
 
 Pop goes the flash unit (see 
Figure 7-27).
 
2. Compose the scene in your 
viewfinder and then press the 
shutter button halfway.
 
 The camera achieves focus and 
fires a pre-flash to determine 
how much illumination is 
needed to properly expose 
the scene.
 
3. Take the picture.
 
 The flash fires. The flash unit remains in the locked and loaded position 
until you close it.
 
4. Gently press your fingers on the top of the flash unit to close it.
The effective range of the built-in flash varies depending on the ISO speed 
setting you use and the f-stop. Choosing a higher ISO speed setting and 
large aperture (small f-stop value) extends the range of the built-in flash. For 
example, using the flash with a 3.5 f-stop value and a 100 ISO setting yields a 
range of approximately 12 feet. If you use the same f-stop with an ISO setting 
of 6400, the range increases to approximately 90 feet.
Changing the flash-sync speed in Av mode
When you’re shooting in Aperture Priority (Av) mode, by default the camera 
shutter speed is set between 30 seconds and 1/250 of a second when the flash 
is enabled. The flash duration is very short and fires when the shutter opens, 
which gives you a sharp image of your subject. However, if the shutter speed 
is slow, you see motion trails if your subject moves during the long exposure. 
This can be very artistic. However, if you want to eliminate the possibility 
of motion trails, you can use a custom function to change the shutter speed 
used when a flash unit fires. Choosing one of the options that uses a higher 
shutter speed prevents motion trails, but the background will be dark. To 
change the flash-sync speed when shooting in Av mode:

speed between 1/60 of a second and 1/250 of a second when a flash 
unit is used in Av mode.
 
• 1/250Sec. (Fixed): The camera sets the shutter speed to 1/250 of a 
second when a flash is used in Av mode.
 
6. After choosing an option, press Set.
 
 The text for the selected option is blue.

Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Choosing second-curtain sync
The built-in flash for your camera fires when the shutter opens. This is all 
well and good when you’re photographing people or objects that are stand-
ing still. However, when you use flash to photograph a moving object, the 
duration of the flash is much shorter than the shutter speed of the camera, 
especially when you’re photographing in dim conditions or at night. The 
movement of the object after the flash fires shows up as a blur of motion, 
but the blur is going away from the object. When you enable second-curtain 
sync, the flash fires just before the shutter closes, creating a natural-looking 
motion trail that goes to the object instead of away from it. To enable second-
curtain sync:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Shooting Settings 1 tab.

Using auxiliary flash
Canon manufactures several flash units that are compatible with your EOS 
7D. Some third-party units will probably also fit in your camera hot shoe. 
However, the camera can have an intelligent conversation with the auxiliary 
flash units that are dedicated to (as of this writing) the Canon EOS 5D MKII 
and your beloved EOS 7D. You can control the amount of illumination emit-
ted from dedicated flash 
units with flash compen-
sation (see the upcom-
ing section, “Using flash 
compensation”). The fol-
lowing Canon Speedlites 
work hand in hand with 
your EOS 7D: 420EX, 
430EX, 550EX, 580EX, and 
580EX II. To attach an aux-
iliary flash unit to your 
camera, slide it in the hot 
shoe. Most Canon flash 
units have a thumbwheel 
that you use to firmly lock 
the flash unit in the hot 
shoe (see Figure 7-32).
Using flash compensation
You can increase or decrease the amount of illumination coming from the 
popup flash or a dedicated EOS flash inserted in the camera hot shoe. You 
can increase or decrease flash illumination by up to 3 stops in 1/3 stop incre-
ments. To use flash compensation:
 
 
1. Press the ISO/Flash 
Compensation button.
 
 
2. Rotate the Quick Control dial 
while looking at the LCD panel.
 
 As you move the dial, the expo-
sure level mark moves along the 
exposure indicator (see Figure 
7-33). Rotate the dial clockwise 
to increase flash exposure and 
counterclockwise to decrease 
flash exposure.
Figure 7-32: Attaching an auxiliary flash to your camera.
Figure 7-33: Specifying the amount of flash 
compensation.

169
 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
 
3. Press the shutter button half-
way to achieve focus.
 
 When flash compensation is 
enabled, you see the flash com-
pensation icon in the LCD panel 
(see Figure 7-34).
 
 
4. Press the Flash button.
 
 The built-in flash makes a 
cameo appearance.
 
5. Press the shutter button fully 
to take the picture.
 
 The flash fires with the amount of compensation you added or subtracted. 
 
 Note: Flash compensation stays in effect even when you power off the 
camera. Remember to disable flash compensation when it’s no longer 
needed.
Locking the flash exposure
Another handy lighting option at your disposal is locking the flash exposure to 
a certain part of the frame. This option is handy when your main subject isn’t 
in the center of the frame or you want to throw some extra light on a specific 
part of the scene you’re photographing. Locking flash exposure also works 
when you have a Canon Speedlite in the hot shoe. To lock flash exposure:
 
 
1. Press the Flash button.
 
 The built-in flash unit pops up.
 
2. Move your camera until the center autofocus point is centered over 
the part of the scene that you 
want to lock flash exposure.
 
 
3. Press the M-Fn button.
 
 The camera fires a preflash to 
calculate exposure for the area 
over which you pointed the 
autofocus point. The flash icon 
in the viewfinder flashes on and 
off, and the FE lock icon appears 
(see Figure 7-35).

4. Recompose the scene through the viewfinder and then press the shut-
ter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears in the right side of the viewfinder when the camera 
achieves focus.
 
5. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 The flash unit fires, properly exposing the area over which you locked 
flash exposure.
Controlling External Speedlites from the Camera
The following Canon flash units can be controlled with camera menu set-
tings: 420EX, 430EX, 430EX II, 550EX, 580EX, and 580EX II. You have more 
control with the EX II units that have new bells and whistles engineered for 
the Canon EOS 5D MKII and newer models. And yes, your camera is a newer 
model. But even if you own one of the older EX Speedlites, you can still do 
some cool stuff from the camera menu after you attach the unit to your 
camera hot shoe. You can also control all the aforementioned Speedlites 
wirelessly. That’s right, you can do sophisticated stuff, such as bouncing 
light into shadows, bouncing the light off walls, and more. 
In the upcoming sections, I show you how to control a Speedlite mounted in 
the hot shoe and use the built-in flash as a master to control the Speedlite 
wirelessly. Hmmm . . . Maybe I should’ve called this section, “Flashing for Fun 
and Profit.” At any rate, a whole lot of flashing is going on in the upcoming 
sections.
Controlling a flash in the hot shoe
When you mount a Canon EX Speedlite in the camera hot shoe, you can con-
trol the output with the camera menu and much more. If you have an EX II 
Speedlite, you have gobs of control. The following steps show the options 
you have available with an EX II Speedlite. The options may be different for 
your Canon Speedlite. Refer to your Speedlite manual for additional instruc-
tions. To control flash with camera menu commands:
 
1. Insert a Canon EX or EX II Speedlite in your camera’s hot shoe.
 
 
2. Press the Menu button.
 
 The last used menu displays on the camera LCD monitor.

6. Rotate the Quick Control 
dial to highlight a command 
and then press Set to see the 
options.
 
 The following is a brief rundown 
of each option:
 
• Flash Mode: The default 
option is E-TTL II on most 
Speedlites. The other 
options vary depending on 
the flash unit attached to 
the hot shoe.
Figure 7-37: Controlling your Speedlite with 
camera menu commands.

172
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
• Shutter Sync.: Choose from 1st Curtain (the default) or 2nd Curtain 
shutter sync. The second-curtain sync option may not be avail-
able for your Speedlites. For more information on second-curtain 
sync, see the “Choosing second-curtain sync” section earlier in this 
chapter.
 
• FEB: This stands for flash exposure bracketing. This option is avail-
able only with certain Speedlites: It isn’t supported on EX units or 
the 430EX II. If this option is available for your Speedlite, you can 
take three pictures with different amounts of illumination. This is 
similar to automatic exposure bracketing.
 
• Exp. Comp.: This option gives you the capability to increase or 
decrease the amount of light emitted from the flash unit. Press Set 
to enable the exposure compensation scale and then rotate the 
Quick Control dial to increase or decrease the amount of illumina-
tion from the flash unit. Each mark represents 1/3 stop.
 
• E-TTL II: This option determines how the camera meters the 
scene, which determines the amount of illumination the flash uses 
to properly expose the picture. Your options are Evaluative or 
Average. These options are identical to the metering options that 
I discuss in the “Choosing a Metering Mode” section earlier in this 
chapter.
 
• Zoom: Enables you to specify the flash zoom of supported EX II 
Speedlites from the menu. By default, the flash unit inherits the 
level of zoom from the camera lens. Press Set and rotate the Quick 
Control dial to choose an option supported by your Speedlite. This 
option comes in handy when you want to add a splash of light to 
a specific part of the scene. For example, if you’re photographing 
someone with a lens that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm, change 
the zoom setting of the flash to 105mm and you send a splash of 
light to a focused point in the center of the image.
 
7. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re back in shooting mode and ready to put your new flash settings 
to work.
 
If you’re really into controlling your Canon Speedlite through the camera, 
check out the External Flash C.Fn Setting menu. This menu has options 
for custom functions that you can use to gain further control over your 
Speedlite. The available functions vary depending on the Speedlite you own. 
Refer to your Speedlite manual for more information.

 Chapter 7: Using Advanced Camera Features
Going wireless
The EOS 7D built-in flash can turn you into a real control freak. As I mention 
previously, you can control the output of the flash. With a few menu com-
mands, you can turn the built-in flash into a control freak. The built-in flash 
acts as the master, and any Canon EX Speedlite capable of functioning as a 
slave can be fired in conjunction with it. Just think of the possibilities with 
multiple flash units illuminating a scene. 
The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. You can even set 
up a portable studio with a couple Canon Speedlites and your EOS 7D. 
Unfortunately a detailed discussion showing you how to use Canon Speedlites 
as slave units is beyond the scope of this book. If you have one or more Canon 
Speedlites or you want to know more about flash photography with Canon 
Speedlites, pick up a copy of Canon Speedlite System Digital Field Guide by 
J. Dennis Thomas (published by Wiley). If you purchase that book, you can 
disregard the ST-E2 wireless transmitter because with a few menu commands, 
you can get your EOS 7D’s built-in flash to act as a wireless transmitter.
The first type of wireless shooting enables you to fire one or more external 
Speedlites that are controlled by the built-in flash unit. The built-in flash unit 
fires a beam to trigger the external flash unit and also adds illumination to 
the exposure. With this option, you can control the ratio of the built-in flash 
to the off-camera flash units. In other words, you determine whether the 
on-camera flash fires at full power and the off-camera flash fires at half 
power, and so on. You can also make the off-camera flash units more power-
ful than the built-in flash unit. To control one or more external Speedlites 
with the built-in flash:
 
1. Position one or more Canon Speedlites that can operate as a slave unit.
 
 Canon Speedlites come with a small stand that can be screwed into a 
light stand. The positioning depends on where you want to add light to a 
scene. Some standard lighting patterns are used by portrait and fashion 
photographers. Unfortunately, coverage of these patterns is beyond the 
scope of this book.
 
2. Switch the external Speedlite(s) to slave mode and then set the channel 
that the slave will receive instructions from the camera’s built-in flash.
 
 On many Canon Speedlites, you use a switch to have the unit operate as 
a slave. Refer to your Speedlite manual for more instructions. Make sure 
the external flash unit(s) sensor (the red plastic rectangle on the front of 
the unit) faces the camera. You can swivel the Speedlite head so that the 
flash is aimed at your subject and the sensor faces the camera.

 I know this is a no-brainer, but make sure you select the same channel 
as that to which you set your external Speedlite. After you press Set, the 
camera is set to communicate with an external Speedlite on the same 
channel.
 
11. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the Flash Ratio option (see

Figure 7-41: Setting the flash ratio between the built-in flash and external Speedlites.
 
12. Rotate the Quick Control dial to choose a Flash Ratio option.
 
 The default option is 1:1, which means both the built-in flash and 
off-camera flash units fire at full power. If you choose a different ratio, 
the off-camera flash units contribute more illumination to the exposure 
than the built-in flash. For example, at the 2:1 ratio, the off-camera 
flash unit is two times as powerful as the on-camera flash unit or one 
additional stop of exposure.
 
13. (Optional) Rotate the Quick Control dial to navigate to Flash Exp. 
Comp (see the left side of Figure 7-42) and then press Set.

compensation.
 
 As you rotate the dial, the indicator moves to indicate how much you’re 
increasing or decreasing the exposure. Each mark represents 1/3 stop.
 
 15. Press the Picture Style button to fire a test flash.
 
 If you’ve set up everything correctly, your external Speedlite fires. 
 
 If the external flash doesn’t fire, make sure the sensor (the red dome on 
the front of the flash) can see the signal from the camera flash. If not, 
swivel the flash head so that it’s pointing toward your subject, and the 
red dome is facing the camera. 
 
 16. Press the Flash button.
 
 The built-in flash pops up, and you’re now ready to take a picture illu-
minated by one external Speedlite that’s controlled by the camera’s 
built-in flash.
 
17. Take the picture.
 
 When you press the shutter button, the external Speedlite(s) fires.
You can also create exposures in which the built-in flash doesn’t fire and trig-
gers the external Speedlites. When you choose this option, you can set up the 
external units in up to three groups and manually set the external Speedlites 
with the built-in menus. From the camera, you can control the ratio between 
two groups, plus add exposure compensation to the mix. To control two or 
more external Speedlites without firing the built-in flash:

• A+B+C: Up to three groups of external Speedlites fire with the same 
power.
 
• A:B: Two groups of Speedlites fire. You can control the ratio 
between the two groups.
 
• A:B C: Three groups of Speedlites fire. Use group C as backlighting 
to fill the shadows created by groups A and B. You can control the 
ratio between group A and B. You can add exposure compensation 
for groups A and B collectively, and add exposure compensation 
for group C.

 Your firing group is cast in stone until you change it.
After setting up wireless shooting and choosing the firing group, you’re ready 
to specify options for it. If you choose the A+B+C option, you can’t control the 
ratio between the groups. You can, however, add flash exposure compensa-
tion, which is applied equally to all external Speedlites. If you choose one of the 
other Firing Group options, you have more control over the external flash units.
If you choose the A:B firing group, follow these steps:
 
1. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight A:B Fire Ratio (see the left 
side of Figure 7-45) and then press the Set button.

I
n earlier chapters, I show you all the bells and whistles on your camera 
that you can use in your photography. Bells and whistles are cool, but if 
you don’t know when to ring or blow them, they don’t do you much good. 
In this chapter, I cut to the chase and show you how to use these 
features for specific types of photography. Of course you may 
not be interested in all the types of photography I discuss 
in this chapter. But I like to practice several different 
photography disciplines. 
I find that different disciplines keep me on my 
toes and keep my work fresh. Not to mention 
they help me get to know my camera better. Try 
diversifying — you might like it. At any rate, in this 
chapter, I show you what settings to use for specific 
types of photography. I also sprinkle in some tips 
that will take your photography to the next level.
Choosing the Optimal Settings 
for Specific Situations
Your camera has settings for every conceivable type of photography. All you 
need to do is attach the right lens to the camera and you’re ready for action. 
You can take pictures of just about any object from a small insect to a racing 

186
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
car traveling at a high rate of fuel consumption. But the trick is knowing 
what settings to use for a specific picture-taking situation. For example, say 
you’re photographing your significant other and want her to be the center of 
attention with a soft blurry background. That’s easy to achieve with the right 
camera setting and the right lens.
In addition to the right settings, you have to be creative so your photograph 
of a known person, place, or thing doesn’t look like someone else’s photo-
graph of the same person, place, or thing. To take great pictures you have to 
examine everything in the viewfinder and determine whether it’s something 
you should include in the photograph. With a bit of thought and keen obser-
vation, you’ll notice that light pole sticking out of your significant other’s 
head and ask her to move to a different position, or you’ll move to a different 
position.
Photographing Action
Your camera is well-equipped to photograph action, whether your subject is 
a flock of flying birds or the Blue Angels in formation. When you photograph 
an object in motion, your goal is to portray motion artistically. The camera 
settings and lens you use depend on the type of subject you’re photograph-
ing. If you’re photographing a marathon runner, you want to depict the 
beauty and grace of his fluid stride and athletic body. If you’re photographing 
a racecar, your goal is the same. You want to depict the beauty of a beauti-
fully sculpted racecar at speed. So the type of settings you use depends on 
whether your subject is moving toward you or parallel to you, and whether 
your subject is moving very fast or very slow.
Photographing fast-moving subjects
When people see my photographs of racecars, they always assume I’m using 
a fast shutter speed because the car looks so clear and they can see every 
detail, including the driver’s name on the side of the car. But I do just the 
opposite. I shoot with a relatively slow shutter speed when the car is traveling 
parallel to me. To photograph a fast-moving subject:
 
1. Attach a telephoto lens to your camera.
 
 The focal length of the lens depends on how far away your subject is. 
When I photograph racecars, I use a Canon 70–200 mm f/4 lens. If the 
cars are relatively close to me, I can zoom out and still get the whole car. 
If they’re far away, I zoom to 200mm, which on this camera is the 35mm 
equivalent of a 320mm lens.
 
2. Point the camera where your subject will be when you take the pic-
ture and then zoom in.

187
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
 If you’re photographing an automobile race, you can compose your 
picture a lap before you take it. I generally zoom to almost fill the frame 
with the car and then zoom out a little, leaving a little distance in front of 
the car to give the impression that the car is going somewhere.
 
 
3. Switch to AI Servo autofocus mode so that your camera focuses contin-
ually on your subject as it moves closer to or farther from you.
 
 If your camera has a hard time keeping fast-moving subjects in focus, 
you can focus manually on the spot where the object will be when you 
take the picture.
 
 
4. Switch to a single autofocus point in the center of the frame.
 
 
 When you use multiple autofocus points, the camera may focus on an 
object other than the one you want to photograph. Alternatively, you 
can use the middle autofocus zone. For more information on choosing 
an autofocus point, see Chapter 7.
 
 
5. Rotate the camera shooting Mode dial to Tv (Shutter Priority mode), 
and then rotate the Quick Control dial to select a shutter speed of 
1/125 second.
 
 You may have to use a slightly higher shutter speed if you’re using a 
focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 200mm or greater. The aper-
ture really doesn’t matter with this technique. The background is sta-
tionary, but the car and camera are moving at the same relative speed. 
Therefore, the background will be a blur caused by the motion of the 
camera relative to the background.
 
6. Spread your legs slightly and move your elbows to the side of your 
body. Cradle the barrel of the lens with your left hand and position 
your right forefinger over the shutter button.
 
 This helps stabilize the camera as you pan with your subject. In this 
position, you’re the human equivalent of a tripod.
 
7. Pivot from the waist toward the direction from which your subject will 
be coming.
 
8. When your subject comes into view, press the shutter button halfway 
to achieve focus.
 
 Sometimes the camera has a hard time focusing on a fast-moving object, 
such as a fighter jet traveling several hundred miles per hour. If this 
is the case, switch to One-Shot AF mode, switch your lens to manual 
focus, and focus on the place where your subject will be when you press 
the shutter button. Press the shutter button just before your subject 
reaches the spot on which you’ve focused.
 
9. Pan the camera with your subject to keep it in frame.
 
 When you’re photographing an object in motion, a good idea is to keep 
more space in front of the object than behind it. This shows your viewer 
the direction in which your subject is traveling.

188
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
10. Press the shutter button when your subject is in the desired position 
and follow through.
 
 If you stop panning when you press the shutter button, your subject 
won’t be sharp. Figure 8-1 is a photograph of a racecar racing through a 
corner. I used the panning technique to catch the essence of speed. At 
this point, the car was traveling well over 100 mph.
Figure 8-1: Depicting the beauty of speed.
Freezing action
When your subject is traveling toward or away from you at a fast rate, your 
goal is to freeze the action. Another time you want to freeze action is when 
you want the photo to depict the beauty and grace of your subject. An exam-
ple of this is a closeup of a tennis player with the ball just leaving her racket 
or a water skier slicing through the water. To freeze action:
 
1. Attach a telephoto lens to your camera.
 
 The focal length of the lens depends on how far away your subject is. 
I generally use a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 300mm or 
longer. This puts some distance between me and the subject. A tele-
photo lens also does a great job of compressing the background. For 
example, if you’re photographing a gaggle of racecars, a long focal length 
makes them look like they’re closer to each other than they actually are.

189
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
2. Point the camera where your subject will be when you take the pic-
ture and then zoom in.
 
 When you compose the picture, leave some room in front of your sub-
ject to give the appearance that it’s going somewhere. I generally try to 
include some of the background to give viewers an idea of the locale in 
which the photograph was taken.
 
 
3. Press the AF-Drive button and then rotate the Quick Control dial to 
switch to AI Servo focus mode so that your camera focuses continually 
on your subject as it moves toward or away from you.
 
 Your camera may have a hard time focusing on a fast-moving vehicle. 
I had this problem when photographing the start of an automobile 
race. The cars were traveling well over 100 mph at the place I wanted 
to photograph them, so I switched to manual focus and focused on an 
expansion joint. I snapped the shutter just before the car crossed the 
expansion joint. For more information on switching focus modes, see 
Chapter 7.
 
 
4. Press the AF Point Selection/Magnify button and then press the M-Fn 
button to switch to a single autofocus point in the center of the frame.
 
 With multiple autofocus points, the camera may focus on something 
other than your subject. For more information on switching to a single 
autofocus point, see Chapter 7.
 
5. Rotate the shooting Mode dial to Tv (Shutter Priority mode) and then 
rotate the Main dial to choose a shutter speed of 1/1000 of a second.
 
 Choose a higher shutter speed when trying to freeze the motion of some-
thing like a pitcher throwing a fastball. When you set the shutter speed, 
make note of the f-stop. If you can get a 5.6 or 7.1 f-stop, the background 
will be recognizable but not in sharp focus. You may have to experiment 
with different ISO speed settings to achieve the optimal shutter speed 
and aperture combination. Note that if you’re shooting in low ambi-
ent light, you may see the maximum aperture (smallest f/stop number) 
blinking in the viewfinder, which means the image will be underexposed 
at the current shutter speed. Either choose a slower shutter speed, or 
increase the ISO until the aperture stops blinking.
 
 
6. Press the AF-Drive button and then rotate the Quick Control dial to 
switch to Hi Speed Continuous mode.
 
 With this mode, you can capture a sequence of images as long as your 
finger is on the shutter button at approximately 8 fps (frames per second). 
This is a great way to capture a sequence of your dog catching a Frisbee. 
For more information on choosing a Drive mode, see Chapter 6.
 
7. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears on the right side of the viewfinder when you 
achieve focus. When shooting in AI Servo autofocus mode, the camera 
updates focus as your subject moves toward or away from you.

190
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
 If the dot is flashing, the camera can’t achieve focus. You may experi-
ence this when you try to focus on a subject that’s traveling very fast. 
If this happens, switch to One-Shot AF mode, switch the lens to manual 
focus, and then pre-focus on the place your subject will be when you 
take the picture.
 
8. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
 
 If you switched to manual focus, press the shutter button just before the 
subject moves to where you focused. Figure 8-2 was photographed at 
the start of an automobile race. In this case, I switched to manual focus 
and focused on an expansion strip in the race track, which began life as 
a WWII airport.
Figure 8-2: Freezing motion.
 
To get the knack of this technique, photograph one of your family members 
bouncing a ball or photograph your son or daughter throwing a knuckleball 
at baseball practice.

191
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
Photographing slow-moving subjects
I cover freezing motion and capturing the essence of speed in previous sec-
tions in this chapter. Here I show you techniques to photograph things that 
move slower, such as horses, runners, and bicyclists. When you freeze the 
motion of subjects like these, the end result is kind of boring. When you pho-
tograph slow-moving subjects like runners or cyclists, use blur creatively to 
capture a compelling photograph of your subject. This technique also works 
great for photographing birds in flight. To photograph slow-moving objects:
 
1. Attach a telephoto zoom lens to your camera.
 
 You can do this technique with a lens with a shorter focal length of 
50mm. However a longer focal length compresses the background. I like 
to use my 70–200mm lens when photographing slow-moving subjects.
 
2. Point the camera where your subject will be when you take the pic-
ture and zoom in.
 
 
3. Press the AF-Drive button and then rotate the Quick Control dial to 
switch to AI Servo autofocus mode.
 
 After the camera locks focus, your camera updates focus continually 
as your subject moves toward you. For more information on switching 
autofocus modes, see Chapter 7.
 
 
4. Press the AF Point Selection/Magnify button and then press the M-Fn 
button repeatedly to switch to a single autofocus point in the center of 
the frame.
 
 When you use multiple autofocus points, the camera may inadvertently 
focus on an object other than the one you want to photograph. For more 
information on switching to a single autofocus point, see Chapter 7.
 
 
5. Rotate the shooting Mode dial to Tv (switch to Shutter Priority mode) 
and then rotate the Main dial to select a shutter speed of 1/30 second 
or slower.
 
 This shutter speed is a good starting point, but don’t be afraid to choose 
a slower shutter speed. I often photograph runners and bicyclists at a 
shutter speed of 1/6 second.
 
6. Spread your legs slightly and move your elbows to the side of your 
body.
 
 This stabilizes the camera, which is important when you’re shooting at a 
slow shutter speed.

192
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
7. Pivot from the waist toward 
the area from which your sub-
ject will be coming.
 
8. When your subject comes into 
view, press the shutter button 
halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears in the right 
side of your viewfinder when 
you achieve focus. When you 
shoot in AI Servo autofocus 
mode, the camera updates focus 
as your subject moves.
 
9. Pan the camera with your sub-
ject and then press the shutter 
button when your subject is at 
the desired spot.
 
 Remember to follow through.
When you use this technique, certain 
parts of your subject are in relatively 
sharp focus, but body parts, such as 
a runner’s arms and legs, are a blur 
of motion (see Figure 8-3).
Photographing Landscapes
If you live in an area like I do where you can discover lots of lovely 
landscapes — thank you, Joni — capturing compelling pictures of 
the landscapes is an excellent way to use your camera. Landscape 
photography is a time-honored tradition. The fact that you own a camera 
capable of capturing images with an 18-megapixel resolution means that 
you can create some very big prints of your favorite landscapes. My home 
is decorated with photographs I’ve shot since moving to the Gulf Coast of 
Florida in December 2008. To photograph landscapes:
Figure 8-3: Using motion blur creatively.

193
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
1. Attach a wide-angle zoom lens to your camera.
 
 When you’re photographing landscapes, you want to capture the wide 
expanse. Use a lens that can zoom out to a focal length that is the 35mm 
equivalent of 28mm or less. My favorite lens has a focal length that is the 
35mm equivalent of 17mm.
 
 
2. Rotate the shooting Mode dial to Av (Aperture Priority mode) and 
then rotate the Main dial to choose the smallest aperture (highest 
f-stop value) possible for the lighting conditions.
 
 A small aperture gives you a large depth of field. When you’re photo-
graphing something like the Grand Canyon, you want to see everything 
from foreground to background. When I photograph landscapes, I use an 
aperture of f/11.0 or smaller. Keep in mind, you may have to increase the 
ISO speed setting when photographing in cloudy or overcast weather. 
For more information on Aperture Priority mode, see Chapter 6.
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
 A green light appears in the viewfinder when the camera achieves focus. 
Take note of which autofocus points glow red. In spite of the large depth 
of field you get with a small aperture, you don’t want the camera focus-
ing on items in the foreground.
 
4. Press the shutter button fully to take the picture.
Landscape photography is rewarding. The preceding steps get you started 
in the right direction, but the time of day is also very important. If you think 
morning is for eating breakfast and the time before sunset is for eating 
dinner, you have it all wrong. These are the times you need to be chasing the 
clouds with your camera in hand. And yes, I do mean “chasing the clouds” 
because clouds add interest to any landscape. If you have a still body of 
water into which the clouds can reflect, you have an even more compelling 
picture. The light in the morning just after sunrise and the light just before 
sunset is warm, almost golden in color. That’s why the hour after sunrise and 
the hour before sunset is the Golden Hour. This is when you need to photo-
graph your landscapes (see Figure 8-4).
Composition is a very important part of photography, especially when you 
photograph a landscape. Your goal is to draw your viewer into the image. 
For more information on composing your photographs, check out the 
“Composing Your Images” section later in this chapter.

194
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Figure 8-4: Photographing landscapes in the Golden Hour.
Photographing the Sunset
Sunset is an awesome time of day for photographers. The sun is low on the 
horizon, casting warm orange light. Add clouds to the equation and you have 
the recipe for great sunset pictures. When you photograph a sunset, the sun 
is obviously a key player, but you need other ingredients, such as clouds and 
an interesting landscape, for a great shot. Without clouds, you have a boring 
picture of an orange ball sinking in a cerulean sky. You can take pictures 
of sunsets with the skyline of your town in silhouette. You can get an even 
better sunset shot when you have a body of water such as a lake, a river, or 
an ocean. The water will reflect the colorful clouds.
You can get some great sunset pictures in the final few minutes before the 
sun sets. After the sun sets, many photographers pack up their gear and head 
home. This is a mistake. As long as the clouds don’t go all the way to the hori-
zon, the sun will reflect warm colors on the underside of the clouds for about 
10 to 15 minutes after setting. If you want really great sunset pictures, wait a 
few minutes after the sunset and get ready to take some pictures when the 
clouds are bathed in giddy shades of pink, orange, and purple (see Figure 8-5).

195
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
Figure 8-5: Catching the perfect sunset.
The camera settings for a sunset are almost identical to those you use for 
landscapes, with the exception of lens choice. If you’re going for the grand 
view, use a wide-angle lens with a minimum focal length that’s the 35mm 
equivalent of 28 mm or less, and choose the smallest possible aperture for 
a large depth of field. Sometimes you may need to go the other route and 
choose a telephoto focal length and a fairly large aperture for a limited depth 
of field. 
Recently I photographed a sunset at a picturesque beach a few minutes from 
my home. I used my Canon 24–105mm F 4.0 L lens and zoomed to 105mm, 
with an aperture of f/7.1. I focused on some nearby sea oats. The sea oats 
were in silhouette and in sharp focus, the clouds were a little soft, and the 
sun was a soft out-of-focus orange orb, as shown in Figure 8-6. But due to the 
telephoto lens, the sun is relatively large in the resulting photo, which makes 
it clear I took the photo as the sun was setting.

Developing a style
Photographers are attracted to different sub-
jects and do things in different ways. Casual 
photographers tend to produce similar images, 
but die-hard photographers like to do things 
differently. Die-hards have a different way of 
seeing things, and therefore, produce different-
looking images, even when they photograph the 
same subjects. They experiment with different 
lenses, different vantage points, different light-
ing, and so on.
Each year thousands of photographs are taken of 
Yosemite National Park, yet most of them pale in 
comparison with the memorable images photo-
graphed by Ansel Adams. The key to developing 
your own style is to study the work of the masters. 
If you’re a landscape photographer, check out 
Ansel Adams’s work. If you like the gritty down-
to-earth street journalism style of photography, 
look at Henri Cartier-Bresson’s work. The next 
step is to shoot what you love as often as you can.

197
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
When you photograph a sunset, the camera metering system may make the 
scene much brighter than it actually is. If you notice this when reviewing the 
image on the camera LCD monitor, lock exposure on the sky and then take 
the picture. Alternatively, you can use exposure compensation to reduce 
exposure by one stop or more. For more information on exposure compensa-
tion and locking focus, see Chapter 6.
 
When you photograph the sun, don’t look directly at the sun through your 
viewfinder or you may damage your vision. If you photograph sunsets with 
Live View mode or with the mirror locked, don’t point the camera at the sun 
for a long period of time because you may damage some of the sensitive com-
ponents in your camera.
Photographing People and Things
You have a great camera that can do many things. Photographing people and 
the world around you is another great way to use your camera. When you 
photograph people and things, your goal is to create a compelling photo of 
the object or person, a portrait if you will. In the upcoming sections, I offer 
some advice for photographing people and things.
Photographing people and pets
With the right lens, your camera can capture stunning photos of people or 
pets. You can photograph formal or candid portraits, or use Live View mode 
to shoot from the hip. When you photograph people and pets, here are some 
things to keep in mind:
 
✓ Use a telephoto lens with a focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 
85mm or longer.
 
✓ Switch to Aperture Priority (Av) mode. (For more information on 
Aperture Priority mode, see Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Switch to a single autofocus point or the middle autofocus zone. (For 
more information on modifying autofocus, see Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Choose your largest aperture (smallest f-stop value). Choosing a large 
aperture gives you a small depth of field. Your subject is in focus, but 
the background is a soft, out-of-focus blur.
 
✓ If you’re taking the picture indoors, photograph your subject against a 
solid color wall. You can also tack a solid color bedsheet to a wall and 
use that as a backdrop.

198
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
✓ If you’re photographing your subject outdoors, photograph her against a 
nondescript background, such as distant foliage. If you photograph your 
subject with a telephoto lens with a large aperture and shoot wide open 
(photographer-speak for using your largest aperture), the background 
will be a pleasant out-of focus blur that won’t distract your viewer’s 
attention from your subject (see Figure 8-7).
 
✓ If possible, don’t use the built-in flash because this produces a harsh 
light that isn’t flattering for portraits. Available light from a window is 
your best bet.
 
✓ When you’re shooting portraits of a friend, relative, or your pet, take 
lots of pictures. Your subject will give you more natural expressions as 
he relaxes.
Figure 8-7: Photographing your subject against a plain
background. 

199
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
✓ If you have a Canon Speedlite, mount it in the hot shoe and then bounce 
it off a white surface, such as a wall or the ceiling. When you bounce the 
flash off a large surface, you end up with a soft diffuse light similar to 
that of a cloudy day.
 
✓ When using flash to illuminate your subject, make sure she’s not too 
close to the wall; otherwise, you’ll get a nasty shadow.
 
✓ Use Live View mode when you want candid shots of friends or your pet. 
After enabling Live View, place the camera on a table with the end of the 
lens just off the table. When you see something interesting happen, take 
a picture. Your friends won’t be as intimidated by the camera on the 
table as they would if you held the camera to your face.
 
✓ Never photograph pets with flash. The bright light scares them.
 
✓ When you photograph a person or a pet, make sure the eyes are in 
focus. To do so:
 
1. Switch to a single autofocus point when photographing a head-and-
shoulders portrait.
 
2. In the viewfinder, align the autofocus point with the person’s (or 
pet’s) eye and press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus.
 
3. Recompose the shot and take the picture.
 
 Remember that the eyes are the windows to the soul.
You need to consider lots of things when you photograph people and pets, 
much more than I can include in this book. If you want more information on 
portrait photography, check out Digital Portrait Photography For Dummies 
(Wiley) by yours truly.
Exploring selective focus
When you own a camera like the EOS 7D and a lens with a large aperture of 
2.8 or larger, you can create some wonderfully artistic photos by using the 
selective focus technique. When you take pictures with the largest aperture 
on a lens with a focal length that’s the 35mm equivalent of 85mm or longer, 
you have a wonderfully shallow depth of field. You can use this to your 
advantage by focusing on one spot that will be your center of interest. The 
rest of the image will be out of focus, and your viewer’s attention will be 
drawn to the point in sharpest focus. To create images with this technique:
 
1. Switch to a single autofocus point and Aperture Priority mode.
 
 See Chapter 7 for more on autofocus points and see Chapter 6 for more 
on the Aperture Priority mode.

2. Look through the viewfinder and position the autofocus point over 
your center of attention.
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway to achieve focus and then recompose 
the image.
 
 I photographed Figure 8-8 with a Canon 85mm f/1.8 lens. I switched to a 
single autofocus point and focused on the Harley Davidson badge.

Exploring macro photography
Extreme close-up photography, also known as macro photography, can be a 
tremendous source of enjoyment. With a macro lens, you can get close to 
small insects, flowers, and other objects that look interesting when magnified 
to life-size proportions. Keep the following in mind when working with macro 
photography:

201
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
✓ Canon makes a wonderful lens for macro photography — the 100mm EF 
f/2.8 lens — which works on your EOS 7D. You can also choose from lots 
of third-party macro lenses available for your camera.
 
✓ Focus is extremely important because when you use a macro lens and 
get very close to your subject, you’re dealing with a very limited depth 
of field. 
 
✓ Macro photography is almost impossible to do when the weather is 
windy because your subject keeps moving in and out of focus. If it’s 
not too windy, switch the autofocus mode to AI Focus. If the camera 
achieves focus and the item you’re photographing moves, the camera 
switches to AI Servo and updates focus.
 
✓ When you decide to get small and go macro, shoot in Aperture Priority 
(Av) mode (see Chapter 6) and choose the smallest aperture possible 
for the lighting conditions. This gives you a slightly larger depth of field.
 
✓ A good tripod is a handy accessory when shooting macro photography 
because it keeps the camera steady. If you’re not using a tripod, shoot at 
a higher shutter speed than you normally would. Keep as steady as pos-
sible, focus, and gently squeeze the shutter when you exhale.
Photographing Wildlife
With a camera like the EOS 7D, you can capture stunning photos of wildlife, 
whether the animals are moving or standing still. Photographing wildlife can 
be challenging, but the results are extremely rewarding. When you shoot 
wildlife with a camera and get a great shot, the animal lives to see another 
day and you have a wonderful trophy to matte and frame. The following sec-
tions offer some tips for photographing wildlife in different locations.
Photographing animals at state parks
The easiest way to find spots to photograph wildlife near your home is to 
Google state park followed by the name of the town or county in which you 
live. Another good source for information are the people in your local camera 
store or camera club. Be nosy and ask them where their favorite wildlife 
photography spots are. Make friends with them and ask whether you can 
tag along on one of their photo shoots. I live in an area that has many state 
parks. I recently moved to my current stomping grounds and had the good 
fortune to find a photography buddy who has shown me many of the wonder-
ful wildlife hot spots near my home. Here are some things I’ve figured out 
about photographing wildlife in a state park:

202
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
✓ Photograph animals with a long lens. Unless you’re photographing 
large animals, you’ll need a long lens with a focal length that is the 35mm 
equivalent of 300mm or greater. State parks are animal sanctuaries. Even 
though the animals are protected, they’re wary of humans. A long lens is 
the only way you can get closeups of the animals.
 
✓ Switch to Shutter Priority (Tv) mode (see Chapter 6) and choose the 
proper shutter speed. When you’re photographing wildlife with a long 
lens, camera shake due to operator movement is magnified. Choose a 
shutter speed that’s equal to the reciprocal of the 35mm equivalent of 
the lens you’re using. If you’re using a lens with a focal length that is the 
35mm equivalent of 300mm lens, you have to choose a shutter speed 
that is at least 1/300 of a second. If your lens has image stabilization, 
enable it when photographing wildlife. You may have to increase the 
ISO speed (see Chapter 7) to get the proper shutter speed, especially if 
you’re photographing wildlife in a forest or in dense foliage. A tripod is 
also useful to stabilize the camera.
 
✓ Use a large aperture (small f-stop number) when you create wild-
life portraits. The shallow depth of field you get with a large aperture 
ensures that your viewer’s attention is drawn toward the animal, and 
not the background (see Figure 8-9).
Figure 8-9: Use a large aperture when creating wildlife portraits.

203
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
✓ Switch to a single autofocus point (see Chapter 7) and focus on the 
animal’s eyes. If the eyes aren’t in focus, you’ve missed the shot. When 
you’re shooting wildlife with a long lens and using a large aperture, you 
have a very shallow depth of field, which makes accurate focus a neces-
sity. If the animal’s eyes are in focus, your viewer assumes the entire 
animal is in focus.
 
✓ Always travel with a photo buddy. Many of the animals in state parks 
are fairly benign. However, some of the inhabitants can be dangerous 
if you’re not careful. Many state parks have bears, alligators, and other 
animals that can be hazardous to your health when provoked. While 
you’re in the moment photographing a bird, your buddy can watch your 
back and make sure a dangerous animal like an alligator isn’t sneaking 
up on you. Alligators can pop out of the water like a rocket.
Tracking wildlife
When you photograph animals and birds in the wild, I suggest you switch to 
AI Servo autofocus mode (see Chapter 7). In this mode, the camera tracks 
moving objects, such as a deer loping across a meadow. I also suggest you 
switch to the middle autofocus zone (see Chapter 7). But you do have a prob-
lem with AI Servo mode when photographing wildlife. For instance, if a bird 
that’s closer than the subject you’re tracking flies into the frame, the camera 
switches focus to the bird. You can prevent this from happening by enabling 
a custom function that changes the default tracking method when using the 
AI Servo autofocus mode. After enabling this function, the camera continues 
tracking the object it initially locked focus on, regardless of what pops into 
the frame. Here’s how you do it:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
 The last used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom 
Functions tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight C.Fn III: Autofocus/Drive 
(see the left side of Figure 8-10).
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 The custom functions for autofocus and drive display on the camera 
LCD monitor.
 
5. Press the multi-controller button until the number 3 appears in the 
window at the top-right corner of the camera LCD monitor.
 
 The AI Servo AF tracking method options display (see the right side of 
Figure 8-10).

6. Press Set to highlight the current option.
 
7. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight 1: Continuous AF Track 
Priority and press Set.
 
 The option is highlighted.
 
8. Press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting mode.
 
 After you enable this custom function, when you choose AI Servo auto-
focus mode, your camera tracks the subject it initially locks focus on 
instead of tracking other objects that are closer than the object you 
want to photograph.
Stabilizing the camera when 
using long telephoto lenses
When you photograph wildlife with a long telephoto lens, any operator move-
ment is magnified. The simple act of pressing the shutter button, no matter 
how gently you do it, vibrates the camera. The vibration degrades the result-
ing images slightly; it doesn’t appear to be tack sharp. A tripod is a huge help 
when using a long lens, but it doesn’t stop the vibration. Here are two tech-
niques you can use to minimize the vibration transmitted after you press the 
shutter button.
Stabilizing the camera with the Self-Timer
An easy way to stop vibration from reaching the camera is to delay the shut-
ter opening after you press the shutter button. You do this with the Self-
Timer as follows:

205
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
 
 
1. Press the AF-Drive button.
 
2. While looking at the LCD 
panel, rotate the Quick Control 
dial until the 2-second timer 
icon appears (see Figure 8-11).
 
3. Mount the camera on a tripod.
 
4. Compose your scene and press 
the shutter button halfway to 
achieve focus.
 
 When the camera focuses 
on your subject, a green dot 
appears in the viewfinder.
 
5. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 Press the shutter button gently. After you press the shutter button, the 
timer counts down. Two seconds is enough time to stabilize any vibra-
tion transmitted to the camera.
Using Mirror Lockup to stabilize the camera
Your camera can also lock the mirror in the up position before the picture 
is taken. This helps minimize the transmission of any vibration that occurs 
when the mirror moves up prior to opening the shutter. This vibration can 
cause your image to be less than tack sharp. You can enable Mirror Lockup 
using a custom function as follows:
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Custom 
Functions tab.
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight C.Fn III: Autofocus/Drive 
(see the left side of Figure 8-12).
 
4. Press the Set button.
 
 The custom functions for autofocus and drive display on the camera 
LCD monitor.
 
5. Press the multi-controller button until the number 3 appears in the 
window near the top-right corner of the LCD monitor.
 
 The Mirror Lockup options display (see the right side of Figure 8-12).

6. Press Set.
 
 The current Disable option is highlighted.
 
7. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Enable and then press Set.
 
 The text color changes to blue.
 
8. Press the shutter button halfway to return to shooting mode.
 
9. Compose the scene and then press the shutter button halfway to 
achieve focus.
 
 A green dot appears in the right side of the viewfinder.
 
10. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The mirror locks up.
 
11. Press the shutter button again.
 
 The picture is taken.
When you’re using Mirror Lockup in bright conditions, press the shutter 
button as soon as possible after the mirror locks up. Excessive exposure to 
bright light or the sun can damage the sensor. Make sure you disable Mirror 
Lockup as soon as you no longer need it.
Photographing animals at the zoo
If you live in a big city or don’t have any nearby nature reserves, you can still 
get some great shots of wildlife at your local zoo. Visit the zoo on an off day 
when there will be fewer crowds to contend with and get there just before 
feeding time. The animals are likely to be more active prior to feeding time. 

207
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
When you find an animal you want to photograph, make sure no humans (or 
other signs that you’re at a zoo) are in the frame. Switch to Aperture Priority 
(Av) mode (see Chapter 6) and choose your largest aperture. Move around to 
compose the best possible picture and then zoom in on the animal. Patiently 
wait until the animal does something interesting and then take the picture. 
Stick around for a few minutes, and the animal may do something else that’s 
interesting or amusing. If possible, compose your image so that no telltale 
signs, such as fence posts or signs, give away that the image was shot at a 
zoo. If you’re forced to take pictures with these objects, crop them out in 
your image-editing program.
Photographing birds
Birds run the gamut from downright ugly — the turkey vulture comes to 
mind — to beautiful and graceful. If you’ve ever witnessed a snowy egret 
preening, you’ve seen a truly elegant bird. When you photograph birds, it’s 
almost like shooting a portrait of a person. You use a telephoto lens with a 
focal length that is the 35mm equivalent of 85mm or longer. Here are some 
tips for photographing birds with your EOS 7D:
 
✓ If you’re photographing flying birds, switch to the middle autofocus 
zone and switch to AI Servo autofocus mode (see Chapter 7). When 
the camera achieves focus, it updates the focus as the bird flies. If you 
find that the AI Servo tracking deviates when another bird flies into the 
scene, check out the “Tracking wildlife” section earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ If you’re photographing flying birds, switch to Shutter Priority (Tv) mode 
(see Chapter 6), and choose a shutter speed of 1/250 of a second or faster. 
This freezes the bird’s motion. You can also go the other way and choose 
a slow shutter speed of 1/30 of a second. If you choose the slower shutter 
speed route, pan the camera with the bird and then the bird’s wings will be 
blurred, giving you an artistic photograph of a bird in flight.
 
✓ Photograph birds in the morning or late in the afternoon. The light is 
warmer and more pleasing at these times of day. The harsh midday sun-
light isn’t a good light for any subject, even your fine feathered friends.
 
✓ Use a long telephoto lens with a focal length that’s the 85mm equiva-
lent of 200mm or greater. If the lens has a large aperture (small f-stop 
value), you’re in business. The telephoto lens gets you close to your sub-
ject without spooking the bird. Even protected birds in a city park are 
unnerved by the sight of a human at close range. Shooting in Aperture 
Priority (Av) mode (see Chapter 6) and choosing a large aperture helps 
to blur the background. After all, you want photographs of birds, not the 
buildings in the background.

208
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
✓ Crouch down to the bird’s level for a more natural-looking photo-
graph. This often means kneeling in wet grass. Wear a pair of old jeans 
when you photograph wildlife and watch where you kneel; you may 
kneel in a great blue heron’s bathroom.
 
✓ Photograph birds on a cloudy day or a foggy morning. You’ll have 
beautiful diffuse light that won’t cast harsh shadows. If the sky is com-
pletely overcast, you have no shadows. Photograph birds in heavy fog 
and you have no signs of civilization (see Figure 8-13). When you photo-
graph birds in low light, you may have to increase the ISO speed setting 
to get a shutter speed fast enough to take pictures while holding the 
camera. Alternatively, you can use a tripod.
 
✓ Take one shot and then move closer. Get as close as you think you can 
without spooking the bird and then take a picture. With one picture in 
the bank, move closer and take another picture. If you approach the bird 
cautiously, you won’t spook him and may end up getting an extreme 
close-up.

 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
Enhancing Your Creativity
Great photographs are made by creative photographers who stretch the enve-
lope. You can enhance your creativity by trying new things. Schedule a time 
each week when you experiment with new techniques or new equipment. Julia 
Cameron, author of The Artist’s Way, calls this an “Artist’s Date.” When I do 
this, I limit myself to one or two lenses and I often visit familiar territory. When 
you photograph a familiar place and the goal is to enhance your creativity, do 
things differently. Shoot from a different vantage point and use a different lens 
than you’d normally use for the subject. 
When I was out on a recent “Artist’s 
Date,” I spotted brilliant flowers on 
the trail that I was hiking. Normally 
I’d photograph something like this 
from above and zoom in. Instead I 
put my Lensbaby Composer on the 
camera with the +4 and +10 macro 
attachments, placed the camera on 
the grass, and composed the scene 
through the camera LCD monitor 
while shooting in Live View mode 
(see Figure 8-14).
Great photos always inspire me to 
get out the camera and take some pic-
tures. Great photos can also help you become more creative. When you see a 
really great photo, dissect the image and try to figure out what the photogra-
pher did to make it so compelling. Was it a camera technique, or did the pho-
tographer do some editing after the fact to make the image pop? You can find 
great photos on the Internet in lots of places. One of my favorite places is 
http://photo.net. At this Web site, you’ll find many types of inspirational 
photographs from portraits to drop-dead gorgeous landscapes. You can even 
join Photo.net and upload your own images. Next time you need something to 
spark your creativity, look at some great photographs.
 
You can enhance your creativity while you’re taking pictures. Stretching the 
envelope is a wonderful way to create interesting photographs. The following 
points can help you stretch your creativity:
Figure 8-14: Look at things in a new way to 
enhance creativity.

210
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
 
✓ Simplify the scene to its lowest common denominator. A great way 
to do this is to use a large aperture (small f-stop value) and focus your 
camera on the most important part of the scene. Or you can compose 
your picture so the viewer’s eye is drawn to a single element in the 
image.
 
✓ Look for patterns. Patterns are everywhere. For instance, birds in 
flight create a unique pattern; scattered leaves in the gutter create 
interesting random patterns; and flower petals create compelling sym-
metrical patterns. Of course nothing says you have to compose an image 
symmetrically.
 
✓ Don’t fall in love with your first shot. Before moving on, think of other 
ways you can capture the scene. Perhaps you can move to a different 
vantage point, switch lenses, or select a different aperture. Milk a scene 
for all it’s worth and remember to look down. An interesting photograph 
may be beneath your feet.
 
✓ Explore your favorite subject and create a theme of photographs. For 
example, if you’re a cat lover, photograph your cat and then photograph 
the neighborhood cats. When you photograph the same subjects or 
places frequently, you think of new ways to create interesting pictures. 
Your creative juices start flowing and before you know it, you see your 
favorite subject in a different way. Photographing your favorite subjects 
and photographing them often helps you master your camera. 
 
 My favorite subject happens to be landscapes. I live near the ocean and 
not very far from a picturesque river, so lately this has been my theme.
Composing Your Images
A photographer’s job is to create a compelling image, an image that makes 
the viewer take more than a casual glance. When you compose an image 
properly, you draw your viewer into the image. Lots of rules exist for com-
posing a photo. I mention many of them in this section. Your job as a pho-
tographer is to figure out which one best suits your subject. This section is 
designed to make you think about composition when you look through the 
viewfinder of your EOS 7D. You can use the camera viewfinder grid or one of 
the Live View grids as a visual reference. For more information on the Live 
View grid, see Chapter 5. For more information on the viewfinder grid, check 
out Chapter 7.

211
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
When you compose an image, look 
for naturally occurring curves that 
you can use to draw your viewer 
into the photograph. Curves are 
everywhere in nature: Birds have 
curved necks, and roads and paths 
have curves. The trunk of a tree 
curves to cope with Mother Nature 
like the trees in the tundra regions of 
the Rocky Mountain National Park. 
Look for naturally occurring curves 
and compose your image so that the 
curve draws the viewer’s eye into 
the picture.
Many photographers take pictures 
in Landscape format — the image 
is wider than it is tall. When you’re 
photographing a scene like a water-
fall, a person, or anything that’s 
taller than it is wide, rotate the 
camera 90 degrees. This is known as 
Portrait format. The photograph of 
the Anhinga bird in a pine tree (see 
Figure 8-15) is an example of shoot-
ing in Portrait format. A couple other 
compositional elements are in this 
picture: The branch leads your eye into the photo, the bird’s beak is diagonal 
to the other elements in the picture, and then there’s the lovely curve of the 
bird’s neck . . .
Many photographers place the horizon line smack-dab in the middle of the 
picture. Boring! When you’re photographing a landscape, take a deep breath 
and look at the scene. Where is the most important part of the scene? That 
part of the scene should occupy roughly two-thirds of the image. For example, 
if you’re photographing a mountain, the mountain base should be in the lower 
third of the image. When you’re photographing a sunset, place the horizon line 
in the lower third of the image to draw your viewer’s attention to the sky. In 
Figure 8-16, I wanted to draw the viewer’s eye to the massive thunderhead in 
the distance, so I placed the horizon line in the lower third of the image.
Figure 8-15: Using curves as part of your 
composition.

212
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Figure 8-16: Placing the horizon line.
When you’re composing an image, 
you want to draw the viewer’s eye 
to a center of interest in your photo. 
In a composition rule known as the 
Rule of Thirds, imagine your scene is 
divided into thirds vertically and hor-
izontally, creating a grid, as shown 
in Figure 8-17. Compose your picture 
so a center of interest intersects two 
gridlines. The grid you can enable in 
the viewfinder doesn’t quite get the 
job done, but it does give you a point 
of reference. Figure 8-17 shows a grid 
overlay inside a facsimile of your 
EOS 7D viewfinder. Notice where the 
boy is placed in the sunset image. 
The middle of his body intersects two gridlines. This image, therefore, is 
composed according to the Rule of Thirds.
Figure 8-17: Aligning an image according to the 
Rule of Thirds.

213
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
Visualizing Your Images
Anybody can point a camera at something or somebody, press the shutter 
button, and create a photograph. The resulting photograph may or may not 
be good, but that’s not really photography. True photography is studying 
your subject and then visualizing the resulting photograph in your mind’s 
eye. When you visualize the photograph, you know the focal length needed to 
capture your vision, the camera settings to use, and the vantage point from 
which to shoot your image.
Seeing, Thinking, and Acting
To take a good picture, you need a great camera like the EOS 7D. But even 
the EOS 7D doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a good, or even a mediocre, picture. 
Getting a good picture is all about you: Your unique personality, vision, and 
creativity is what separates your photographs from those taken by the guy 
down the street who also owns an EOS 7D. Have you ever looked at two 
photographs of the same subject, yet they look completely different? That’s 
where the skill and unique vision of each photographer comes into play as 
well as the photographer’s comfort level with his equipment. Compare Ansel 
Adams’s fine art photographs of Yosemite to tourist snapshots from there, 
and you’ll see what I mean.
Being in the moment
Some people think of photography as a religion. They approach their equip-
ment and their subject with reverence, awe, and wonder. I’m sure you’ve 
seen photographs that have brought out those feelings in you. There’s no 
reason you can’t create your own jaw-dropping images. One of the best skills 
you can develop is being in the moment — experiencing the present moment 
and not thinking about anything else but the subject you’re about to photo-
graph. If you’re distracted by things you have to do later, you can’t devote 
your total focus to the subject you’re photographing. When you aren’t think-
ing about anything in particular but are instead observing what’s around you, 
you notice things that’d normally pass you by. When you’re in the moment, 
you notice small details, such as the photogenic pile of leaves in the gutter 
or the way the sun dapples through the leaves to create an interesting pat-
tern on the wall. You get better pictures when you’re focused on what you’re 
doing and not fretting about what you’re going to cook for dinner or wear to 
work the next day.

214
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
Practicing ’til your images are pixel-perfect
If you use your camera only once in a blue moon, your pictures will show it. 
Letting your gear gather dust in the closet won’t help you become a better 
photographer. Instead, use your camera every chance you get. Consider 
joining a local camera club because networking with other photographers is 
a wonderful way to get new information. You can also find a mentor there. 
Simply strike up a friendship with an experienced photographer and tell her 
you want to tag along the next time she does a photo shoot.
The best way to practice photography is to take pictures of people, places, 
and things that interest you every chance you get. Practice your photography 
when you see something that inspires you, such as a compelling image in a 
magazine or a picture on the Web. With that inspiration fresh in your mind, 
grab your camera and take lots of pictures of similar subjects.
I often do a photo walkabout. I grab one or two lenses, my trusty camera, 
and my imagination and then drive to a part of town I haven’t photographed. 
I then park the car and start exploring. This photo walkabout gives me a 
chance to learn how to use a new piece of gear or experiment with a new 
technique, which enhances my creativity. Figure 8-18 shows an image I cap-
tured with my Lensbaby Composer with the Creative Aperture kit.
Becoming a student of photography
When you decide to seriously pursue photography, you can find a lot of 
resources. Great portrait photography is all around you. For instance, you’ll find 
portraits of the rich and famous in magazines like People and US Weekly, or 
you can find great pictures of places in magazines like Outdoor Photographer 
or National Geographic. You can find great pictures of things in magazine 
advertisements. Your local newspapers and magazines are also great 
resources for great images.
When you see an interesting image in a magazine, study it carefully. Try to 
determine the type of lens the photographer used and then try to determine 
whether the photographer shot the picture in Aperture Priority or Shutter 
Priority mode. After you ascertain which shooting mode the photographer 
used:
 
✓ In Shutter Priority mode, try to determine whether the photographer 
used a fast or slow shutter speed.
 
✓ In Aperture Priority mode, try to determine whether the photographer 
used a large or small aperture.
Also try to determine how the photographer illuminated the subject. Did he 
use available light, camera flash, or fill flash. If you study great images care-
fully, you can get a rough idea of the settings the photographer used to take 
the picture.

Another great way to understand portrait photography is to study the masters:
 
✓ Annie Leibovitz or Greg Gorman: If you’re into portrait photography, 
study their work.
 
✓ Arnold Newman: Google him if you like to study the work of the old por-
trait photography masters. He created some wonderful environmental 
portraits.
 
✓ Henri Cartier-Bresson: If you like the gritty style of street photography, 
Google him.
 
✓ Ansel Adams or Clyde Butcher: If you enjoy landscape photography, 
study their work. Clyde Butcher is affectionately known as the “Ansel 
Adams of The Everglades.”
 
You can also find lots of examples of great photography at www.photo.net.
Never leave home without a camera
You can’t ask a photo opportunity to wait while you go home to get your 
camera. Photo opportunities happen when you least expect them. Therefore, 
never leave home without a camera, and the camera in your cellphone 
doesn’t count.
If you’re nervous about taking your expensive EOS 7D with you wherever you 
go, I don’t blame you and I actually feel the same way. That’s why I bought 
a relatively inexpensive point-and-shoot camera that I carry with me every-
where I go. When I see something I want to photograph, I reach in the glove 
box of my car, grab my trusty point-and-shoot camera, and snap the picture.
Canon makes the PowerShot G11, a wonderful point-and-shoot camera with 
professional features; it’s a great camera to augment your EOS 7D. The G11 
won’t fit in your shirt pocket, but it will fit in your pants pocket, coat pocket, 
or your glove box.
Waiting for the light
Landscape photographers arrive at a scene they want to photograph and 
often patiently wait for the right light or until a cloud moves into the frame 
to get the perfect picture. Sometimes they’ll backtrack to a spot where they 
know conditions will be better. Good landscape photographers are very 
patient, which is a virtue that all photographers need to cultivate. When you 
arrive at a beautiful scene but the light is harsh, stick around a while or come 
back later when you know the lighting will be better.

217
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
Also wait when you’re shooting candid pictures. Minutes may pass with noth-
ing exciting happening, but don’t put away the camera yet. If you wait 
patiently, something will happen that piques your interest and compels you 
to press the shutter button.
Defining Your Goals
Before you snap the shutter button, get a clear idea of what the final image 
will look like. If you don’t have a goal for the picture or the photo shoot, 
you’re wasting your time, and if you’re photographing a person, you’re wast-
ing your time and your subject’s time. Of course, the goal doesn’t have to be 
a great image. You can go on a photo shoot to experiment with new ideas, 
master a new technique, or experiment with a new lens. After all, practice 
makes perfect.
When you know why you’re taking the picture, you’ll know what settings to 
use, how to light the photo, which lens to use, and so on. If you’re creating 
an image for a friend or a client, adhere to the standard rules of composition. 
However, if you’re creating photographs for yourself, the sky’s the limit and 
you can get as creative as you want. You can shoot from different and unique 
vantage points, tilt the camera, break the composition rules, use an unortho-
dox lens, and so on.
What’s your center of interest?
When you create a picture of a person or place, decide what the main point 
of interest is and how you’ll draw the viewer’s eye there. For some photos, 
the point of interest may be a person’s face or a landmark, such as the 
Lincoln Memorial. If you’re creating a portrait of a pianist, a picture of him 
playing the piano would be appropriate and your center of interest could be 
his hands on the keys.
Sometimes, you have more than one center of interest. When this occurs, 
you can compose the photo in such a manner that one center of interest 
leads the viewer’s eye to the other center of interest. For example, if you’re 
photographing a cellist on a beach near San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, 
you have two centers of interest — the musician and the bridge. Your job is 
to marry these two centers of interest to create a compelling image and guide 
your viewer’s eye through the photo. You also need to compose the photo so 
that one center of interest doesn’t dominate the other.

218
Part II: Beyond Point-and-Shoot Photography 
What’s your best vantage point?
The decision you make on your best vantage point depends on what you’re 
photographing. In most instances, you want to be eye to eye when photo-
graphing a person. If you’re photographing a landscape and the sky or a 
mountain is the dominant feature, choose a vantage point that causes the 
sky or mountain to dominate the upper two-thirds of the image. If you’re 
photographing a scene in which a lake or the ocean is the dominant feature, 
lie on your belly and compose the photo so that the water feature occupies 
the bottom two-thirds of the image. Yup. The old Rule of Thirds is at work. 
Figure 8-19 shows good composition for a scene in which the sky is the 
center of interest.
What else is in the picture?
The only time you aren’t bothered by other objects is when you shoot a por-
trait against a solid color background, such as a wall or a cloth backdrop. But 
even then, you have to notice everything in the viewfinder or LCD monitor. 
If your subject’s too close to the background, you may notice wrinkles from 
a cloth backdrop or texture from a wall. If this happens, ask your subject 
to move forward and then shoot the picture in Aperture Priority mode with 
your largest available aperture. Focus on your subject, and the bothersome 
details in the background will be out of focus.
When you’re taking pictures on location, you often have unwanted objects, 
such as telephone poles in the background. Sometimes you have to decide 
whether to include the distracting elements in the image and then delete 
them in an image-editing application, but that takes time. If you can move 
your subject slightly and make the distracting elements disappear, that’s 
always your best option. You can also move to a different place in the same 
general area with a pleasing background and no distracting elements.
When you’re photographing a landscape, take a careful look in the frame. 
Are power lines visible? Are ugly buildings or trash in the frame? If so, move 
slightly until the distracting elements are no longer in it.
The genius of digital photography
Immediacy is the genius of digital photography. The old days of waiting for 
your film to be developed and returned from the lab are gone. You know if 
you got the shot as soon as it appears on your camera’s LCD monitor. You 
also never have to pay for film again. Ever. But for the most part, people have 
made the switch to digital because they can capture their images on cards 
the size of a postage stamp, they don’t want to worry about film expiration 
dates, and so on.

219
 Chapter 8: Mastering Your EOS 7D
Figure 8-19: Using composition to draw your viewer to the center of interest.
With these advantages comes a curse: If you’re not careful, the very genius 
of digital photography can turn you into a bad photographer. You don’t pay 
for film, so you tend to shoot more images, which is a good thing if you take 
good photographs. But if you just shoot everything that pops up in front of 
your camera, you’re going to get a lot of bad photos that end up in the trash. 
To take advantage of the genius of digital photography, be in the moment 
and do your best to make every image a keeper. Get it right in the camera 
and don’t rely on image-editing applications to fix a bad image. Image-editing 
applications like Photoshop are designed to enhance a correctly exposed, 
well-composed image and make it better. I cringe when I hear a photographer 
say, “I’ll Photoshop it.” Photoshop is not a verb; it’s a tool.
Practice also enters into the equation. When you know your camera like the 
back of your hand and you apply all your attention to your photography, 
you’re well on the way to utilizing the genius of digital photography to its full-
est and capturing compelling photographs.

Editing and 
Sharing Your 
Images

T
aking pictures is a lot of fun. But a time comes 
when you have to get them out of the camera 
and share them with your friends and relatives. In 
this part, I show you how to use Canon software 
to edit your images. If you let the camera process 
the images as JPEG ﬁ les, I show you how to edit 
them with ZoomBrowser EX. If you shoot RAW, 
you get a lot of brownie points because in my 
humble estimation, it’s the best way to go. I show 
you how to edit your RAW ﬁ les in Canon Digital 
Photo Professional. I also show you how to print 
your ﬁ les from both applications.

T
aking pictures is lots of fun. But eventually you fill up all your 
cards. Then it’s time to download them to your computer 
and see what you have. You can do this with third-party 
software, such as Photoshop Lightroom and Photoshop. 
If you don’t have an image-editing application on your 
computer, you can use ZoomBrowser EX, the software 
Canon provides with the camera. ZoomBrowser EX 
isn’t as powerful as Lightroom or Photoshop, but 
you can get a lot done with it.
You have a two-pronged attack for organizing and 
editing your work. Canon ZoomBrowser EX is a util-
ity you use to download and organize your work. 
You can also edit JPEG files in ZoomBrowser EX. But 
if you use the RAW format to capture your images, you 
need to bring in the heavy artillery. Canon Digital Photo 
Professional 3.7 gives you the tools to edit your RAW 
images and export them. In this chapter, I show you how to 
use both applications.

224
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
Introducing the Canon ZoomBrowser EX
The Canon ZoomBrowser EX is your first weapon for organizing images. 
You use the utility to download your images, rate your images, rename your 
images, and more. If you can’t get ’er done in ZoomBrowser EX, you have 
options to launch Canon Digital Photo Professional. All the utilities are pres-
ent on the Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, version 21. If you’ve installed the 
software, you’re ready to play. If not, give your eyes a break and install the 
software. Figure 9-1 shows the Canon ZoomBrowser EX in all its glory.

ZoomBrowser EX shows thumbnails of your images in a main window. The 
window on the left side of the application contains task buttons and two tabs 
to navigate through your image folders. When you select an image, you have 
different viewing options.
Downloading Your Images
The first step in your image-editing journey is downloading images. You can 
download images directly from the camera or from a memory card reader. 

225
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
I suggest the latter. A memory card reader gets the job done faster. To down-
load images to your computer from the camera:
 
1. Connect the USB (Universal Serial Bus) cable supplied with your 
camera to your computer and to the camera (see Figure 9-2).
Attach small end of
USB cable here.
Figure 9-2: Connect your camera to the computer.
 
2. Click the Acquire & Camera 
Settings button, which is on the 
left side of the workspace.
 
 The button expands to show the 
available tasks (see Figure 9-3).
 
3. Click the Connect to EOS 
Camera button.
 
 The EOS Utility 7D application 
appears in the ZoomBrowser EX 
window (see Figure 9-4).
 
4. Click Starts to Download 
Images.
 
 A dialog box appears showing 
you the progress of the down-
load, and a Quick Preview 
window displays each image 
while it downloads to your 
computer. The access lamp on 
your camera flashes while the 
images download.
Figure 9-3: The Acquire & Camera Settings 
commands.

226
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
 After the download is com-
plete, the images appear in 
the ZoomBrowser EX’s main 
window (see Figure 9-5).
 
 The Scroll mode is the default 
viewing mode. You can switch 
to a different viewing mode by 
clicking the desired icon at the 
top of the window. Any images 
or movies you protected in the 
camera have a lock icon above 
them, indicating they’re pro-
tected in ZoomBrowser EX as 
well.
Figure 9-5: The downloaded images appear in the main window.
Figure 9-4: Downloading with the EOS Utility 
7D application.

227
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
Rating, Renaming, and Keywording Images
ZoomBrowser EX downloads your images into folders by the date they were 
photographed. The application inherits the default camera name of img fol-
lowed by a number. Of course, that makes them kind of hard to find. You 
bought an EOS 7D to shoot lots of pictures. Trying to find one picture out of 
thousands is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Fortunately, renaming a 
lot of images in one fell swoop is a fairly easy task in ZoomBrowser EX. You 
can also rate images and add keywords to images, which makes them easier 
to find as well.
Using external card readers
The USB cable that shipped with your camera 
makes it possible to download images to your 
computer; however, downloading images uses 
your camera’s battery power. If you attempt a 
download with a low battery, you run the risk 
of corrupting images or the memory card, if the 
battery exhausts its power during a lengthy 
download. You can also download your images 
with an external card reader. Connect an 
external card reader to a computer USB port 
and you’re ready to download images with 
ZoomBrowser EX or a different application. 
Many card readers accept multiple image card 
formats. For example, if you use a camera like 
the Canon G10 for a second point-and-shoot 
camera, you know that camera uses SD (Secure 
Digital) cards. Many card readers accept the CF 
(CompactFlash) cards your EOS 7D uses as well 
as SD cards.

Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
I find it’s easier to get all your housekeeping done right after you download 
images. The first thing you need to do is rename images. To rename images:
 
1. Select all the images you downloaded.
 
 To select all images, click the first image, and then Shift-click the last 
image. You can rename all images at once.
 
2. Click the View & Classify button.
 
 The menu expands to show the View & Classify options.
 
3. Click the Rename Multiple Files button.
 
 The application refreshes to show the renaming options (see Figure 9-6).
Figure 9-6: Renaming multiple images.
 
4. Choose a renaming option.
 
 I like to show as much information as I can with the image. Therefore, I 
opt for the Shooting Date + New Name + Number option.

229
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
5. Enter a name for the images.
 
 This is the base name for each image you’re renaming. I generally use an 
abbreviation for the place where the photos were taken. For example, if I 
shot some photos in Sarasota, the abbreviation is SARA.
 
6. Deselect the Make Copies of Files check box.
 
 This is selected by default, but face it, making copies of 18-megapixel 
images gobbles up your hard drive in a New York minute. I always 
deselect this option.
 
7. Click the Finish button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX renames the images. A dialog box shows the progress. 
This may take some time if you’re renaming a lot of images. After you 
rename the images, you find them in the folders that were created when 
they were downloaded.
After renaming the images, rank them and add keywords. In the days of 
film, photographers would put their slides on a light box and give them a 
rating from one to five stars, with five-star images being the best of the lot. 
ZoomBrowser EX assigns a default rating of two stars to each image you 
download. You can assign each image a rating of up to three stars.
Using keywords is another method of identifying images. You can add a key-
word to an image that reflects the type of photography, the place in which 
the image was photographed, the name of the person in the photograph, and 
so on.
If you’re like me, you shoot a lot of images at the same place, and they have the 
same basic keywords. You can add keywords to multiple images as follows:
 
1. Click the folder into which the images were downloaded.
 
 You find the folders listed by date in the All Folders tab.
 
2. Select the images that you want to add keywords to.
 
 You can select contiguous images in the ZoomBrowser EX window by 
pressing the Shift key, clicking the first image you want to select, and 
then clicking the last image you want to select.
 
3. Click the Properties button.
 
 The Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 9-7).

230
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
4. Click the View/Modify 
Keywords button.
 
 The View/Modify Keywords 
dialog box appears (see Figure 
9-8). Notice that you have four 
categories into which you can 
add keywords. You can apply 
multiple keywords to each 
image you’ve selected.
 
5. In the text box under the 
applicable category, type a 
keyword that helps you iden-
tify the image.
 
 I generally start with adding the 
town where I shot the image to 
the Places category.
 
6. Click the plus (+) button.
 
 The keyword is added to the 
list.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add 
any additional keywords that 
help describe the photographs.
 
 You could add the person’s 
name, the word sunset if it was 
a sunset shot, and so on.
 
8. After you finish adding key-
words, click the blank box to 
the left of each keyword.
 
 A check mark appears next to 
the keywords (see Figure 9-9).
 
9. Click the desired rank for the 
selected images.
 
 If all the images don’t deserve 
the same rank, don’t change 
the default ZoomBrowser EX 
rank yet.
Figure 9-7: Adding keywords to multiple 
images.

231
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
10. Click OK to apply the keywords to the selected images and then close 
the Properties dialog box.
 
11. Select the images that deserve the same rank, repeat Steps 1–4, choose 
the desired rank for the images, and then click OK.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX assigns the keywords and ranks the images in one 
operation. How cool is that?

232
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
Adding Comments to Images
You can also add comments, which 
appear as metadata, to images. 
Metadata is data, such as shooting 
information, that’s recorded with 
the image when you shoot it and 
data you add, such as keywords and 
comments. You can add whatever 
comment you want that will help you 
remember the image. To add a com-
ment to an image:
 
1. Select the image in 
ZoomBrowser EX and then 
click the Properties button.
 
 The Properties dialog box 
appears.
 
2. Click the Comment down 
arrow.
 
 The Comment text box appears 
(see Figure 9-10).
 
3. Type the comment and then 
close the Properties dialog 
box.
 
 The comment is applied to 
the image.
You can also apply comments to 
several selected images, but you 
have to apply one comment at a 
time. When you select multiple 
images and open the Properties 
dialog box, Next and Previous but-
tons appear at the bottom of the 
dialog box. Apply a comment to one 
image, and then click Next to view 
the properties of the next image 
and apply a comment to it. Continue 
until you’ve applied comments to 
the desired images.
Figure 9-10: Applying a comment to an image.

233
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
Changing Your View
ZoomBrowser EX is quite versatile. You have three different ways to view 
your images. You can view images in Zoom mode, Scroll mode, and Preview 
mode. The mode you choose depends on the task you’re performing. You 
can perform all tasks in Zoom and Scroll mode. In Zoom and Scroll mode, you 
can perform changes to multiple images. In Preview mode, you work on one 
image at a time.
To view images in Zoom mode:
 
1. Click the Zoom Mode tab.
 
 The view shows very small thumbnails (see Figure 9-11). Pause your 
cursor over a thumbnail to reveal a larger image.

3. Click an area inside the Navigator and then drag to view a different 
set of images.
 
 As you drag inside the Navigator, the main window refreshes to show 
different thumbnails.
 
4. Double-click the thumbnail to view it the Preview window.
To view images in Scroll mode:
 
1. Click the Scroll Mode tab.
 
 The view shows larger thumbnails (see Figure 9-13).
 
2. Drag the Zoom slider to increase magnification.
 
 The thumbnails become larger.
 
3. Filter the images by star rating by selecting the applicable check box.
 
 One-, two-, and three-star images are shown by default. Click a check 
box to deselect it and hide images with a specific rating.
 
4. Click the Filter drop-down list.
 
 You can reveal all images, or by star rating.
To view images in Preview mode:
 
1. Click the Preview Mode tab.
 
 One image displays with information (see Figure 9-14). Notice you can 
also add a comment, change the star rating, and protect the image.

about the image. Figure 9-15 shows shooting information, which is meta-
data that’s recorded with the image when you take the picture.

Comparing Multiple Images
When you’re sorting through lots of images from a photo shoot, some of 
the images will look very similar. This is when it’s helpful to view them side 
by side, or in groups. In ZoomBrowser EX, you can view two, three, or four 
images at once. Just follow these steps:

237
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
1. In Zoom mode or Scroll mode, select the number of images you want 
to compare.
 
 You can compare two, three, or four images.
 
2. Click the View Image button.
 
 The first image appears in another window (see Figure 9-16).
Show buttons

 You can view two images split horizontally (ideal for images shot with 
the camera held horizontally), two images side by side (ideal for images 
shot with the camera held vertically), three images side by side, or four 
images. Figure 9-17 shows the three-image display.

Backing Up Your Work
You work hard to capture great photographs with your EOS 7D. Your work 
in ZoomBrowser EX and Canon Digital Photo Professional fine-tunes your 
images, but a computer crash or hard drive failure will wipe out all your 
images in a heartbeat. Canon lets you save images to a CD, but that’s 700MB, 
less than a memory card. I suggest you invest in a good external hard drive 
and use an application to back up your work. I back up my images to a 1TB 
hard drive. After I back up the images, the hard drive is offline until my next 
backup, which minimizes wear and tear on the hard drive.
I know some photographers who leave their external hard drives online all 
the time. And some of them have paid the price when the drive crashed 
and burned. I use the SyncBackSE program to back up my work: It’s quick, 
easy to use, and very intuitive. For more information on SyncBackSE, visit 
www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/sbse-features.html.

239
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
Organizing Your Images
By default, your images are downloaded into the Pictures folder. You can, 
however, organize your work by creating new folders, moving images into dif-
ferent folders, and deleting images.
To create a new image folder:
 
1. In the ZoomBrowser EX All Folders tab on the left side of the work-
space, select the root folder into which you want to create a subfolder.
 
2. Choose File➪New Folder.
 
 The New Folder dialog box appears (see 
Figure 9-18).
 
3. Enter a name for the folder and then 
click OK.
 
 A new folder is born.
To move images to another folder:
 
1. Click the Zoom tab to switch to Zoom mode.
 
 Your new folder and the images in the root folder display.
 
2. Drag images from the root folder into the other folder.
 
 Alternatively, you can select the image and drag it into the desired 
folder, as displayed in the All Folders tab.
To delete one or more images:
 
1. Select the images and press the Delete key.
 
 A dialog box appears asking you to confirm deletion.
 
2. Click OK.
 
 The images are deleted.
Editing JPEG Images in ZoomBrowser EX
You can view all images you download in ZoomBrowser EX, but you can edit 
only JPEG images. You can select RAW images in ZoomBrowser EX and then 
edit them in Canon Digital Photo Professional. When you opt to edit a JPEG

240
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
image in ZoomBrowser, you can correct red-eye, adjust sharpness, trim the 
image, apply an auto-adjustment, and insert text. Alternatively, you can edit 
the image in another application. I can’t cover all the image-editing tools in 
ZoomBrowser EX — doing so is beyond the scope of this book. However, in 
the following sections, I cover the most important ones.
You can adjust the color of a JPEG image in ZoomBrowser EX. You can also 
change the brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can even adjust the 
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) channels and levels as well as use the Tone Curves 
Adjustment menu option to adjust brightness for different tone values. To 
adjust image color:
 
1. Select the image you want to edit and then click the Edit button.
 
 The menu drops down to reveal the editing options.
 
2. Click Edit Image.
 
 The Pick Editor dialog box appears (see Figure 9-19).
Figure 9-19: Editing an image in ZoomBrowser EX.
 
3. Select the Color/Brightness Adjustment option and then click the 
Finish button.
 
 The Color/Brightness Adjustment dialog box appears (see Figure 9-20).

4. Drag the sliders to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast.
 
 The settings you choose are a matter of personal taste. Don’t go too far 
over the top with saturation though because you might create some 
colors that can’t be printed.
 
5. After you make your adjustments, click the Save As button.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears (see Figure 9-21).
Figure 9-21: Saving your edited image.

242
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
6. Choose a format from the Save as Type drop-down list.
 
 You can save the image as a JPEG or TIFF file. If you save the image as a 
JPEG file, you can specify image quality. A higher image quality creates 
a better-looking image at the expense of a larger file size. If you save the 
image as a TIFF file, you can use lossless compression to minimize the 
file size or specify no compression.
 
7. Enter a filename and specify the folder that the image will be saved to.
 
 Image editing is destructive. I urge you to give the image a different 
filename and store it in a different folder. That ensures you’ll have the 
original image to edit at a later date.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, saturation, and contrast, you can 
adjust the color for the red, green, and blue channels by choosing an option 
from the Color Adjustment drop-down list, as shown in Figure 9-20. This 
is fairly advanced image editing, as is one of the other options on the list, 
Levels. The Tone Curve Adjustment option lets you adjust tonality in specific 
brightness ranges. This option is useful and fairly easy to master. To adjust 
the tone curve of a JPEG image:
 
1. Follow Steps 1–4 from the preceding steps.
 
 You’re in the Color/Brightness Adjustment dialog box.
 
2. Choose Tone Curve Adjustment from the Please Select Adjustment 
Option drop-down list.
 
 The dialog box refreshes to show the Tone Curve dialog box (see 
Figure 9-22). The diagonal line is the tone curve. The line isn’t a curve 
now because it’s applying brightness information in a linear fashion 
from shadows (the left side of the curve), midtones (the middle section 
of the curve), and highlights (the right end of the curve). When you 
add points for different tonal values along the curve and drag them to 
adjust brightness, you see a curve.
 
3. Click a point on the curve to make an adjustment for that tonal value.
 
 Click a point near the bottom of the curve to modify the brightness of 
shadow areas, a point in the middle of the curve to change the bright-
ness of the midtones, and a point near the top of the curve to change the 
brightness level for highlights. After you click a point, you see values in 
the Input and Output text boxes (see Figure 9-23).
 
4. To adjust a point, drag it up to make the tonal range brighter or down 
to make the tonal range darker.
 
 You can also change the value in the Output text box. A typical use 
for a tone curve is to apply more contrast to the image, with one point 
near the bottom of the curve, one point in the middle of the curve, 
and one point near the top of the curve. Study Figure 9-23 and note the 
input and output values for the shadow, midtone, and highlight points. 

243
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
I haven’t changed the value for the middle point, which is smack-dab in 
the middle of the tonal value range. Doing so would increase the over-
all brightness of the image. Brightening the highlights and darkening 
the shadows increase image contrast.
 
5. After you make your adjustments, click Save As and then in the Save 
As dialog box, follow the prompts to save the image.

Sharpening an Image
You can sharpen an image in ZoomBrowser EX. When you sharpen an image, 
the application locates image edges and applies additional contrast to make 
the image appear sharper. To sharpen a JPEG image:
 
1. Select the image you want to edit and then click the Edit button.
 
 The menu drops down to reveal the editing options.
 
2. Click Edit Image.
 
 The Pick Editor dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Sharpness option and click the Finish button.
 
 The Sharpness dialog box appears (see Figure 9-24).
Figure 9-24: Sharpening an image.
 
 Note: You also see a tab for Unsharp Mask. This is an advanced image-
editing technique and beyond the scope of this book. However, if you’re 
interested in knowing more about how to use this method of sharpening, 
click that tab. In the upper-right corner of the tab, you see a button with 
a question mark (?) icon. Click the button to summon help.
 
4. Drag the slider to sharpen the image.

245
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
 You can oversharpen an image. As you drag the slider, pay attention to 
the edges. If you see something that looks like a halo, you’ve gone too 
far, Jamie.
Working with RAW Files in 
Digital Photo Professional
When you capture an image with the RAW file format, you have more data 
to work with. The images have a greater bit depth than JPEG images, which 
means you have more colors to work with. I use Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 
to edit and sort my RAW images. I find it’s very intuitive, and I can edit a mas-
sive amount of images in a short amount of time.
Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Elements have a Camera RAW 
editor that enables you to edit RAW images. If you’re just experimenting with 
the RAW format or don’t have one of the aforementioned applications, you 
can edit your work in Canon Digital Photo Professional. You can jump from 
ZoomBrowser EX directly to Canon Digital Photo Professional, or launch the 
application and begin editing.
The following steps show you how to edit RAW files in Canon’s Digital Photo 
Professional:
 
1. Launch Digital Photo Professional.
 
 When you install Canon software, several shortcuts are sprinkled on 
your desktop. You can either click the Digital Photo Professional short-
cut or launch the application from your computer menu. In Windows, 
you’ll find Digital Photo Professional in the Canon Utilities Folder on 
your Start menu.
 
 Any of those methods launches Digital Photo Professional (see Figure 
9-25). The application displays thumbnails for all images that reside in 
the same folder as the image you select in ZoomBrowser EX. A complete 
tutorial of Digital Photo Professional is beyond the scope of this book; 
however, the following steps show you how to process a RAW image in 
the application.
 
2. Select the image you want to edit.
 
 The images you download with ZoomBrowser EX are stored in subfold-
ers of the Pictures folder. The default name of the folder is the date that 
the image was photographed. You’ll find the folders on the left side of 
the interface.

246
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
3. Choose File➪Open in Edit Window.
 
 The image opens in another window. Notice the menus on top of the 
Edit window (see Figure 9-26). These are your commands for editing an 
image in Canon Digital Photo Professional. In the Tools menu, you find 
a Start Stamp tool that enables you to clone pixels from one part of the 
image to another. There’s also a command to trim the image.
Figure 9-25: Editing RAW images in Digital Photo Professional.
Figure 9-26: Editing an image in the Edit window.

247
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
 Unfortunately a detailed tutorial 
of every command is beyond 
the scope of this book. The 
application does offer help that 
you can use if you decide to 
explore some of the more eso-
teric commands. The following 
steps show you how to tweak an 
image with the application.
 
4. Choose View➪Tool Palette.
 
 A floating Tool palette appears 
above the Edit window (see 
Figure 9-27).
 
5. Drag the Brightness 
Adjustment slider to brighten 
or darken the image.
 
 As you drag the slider, you see 
the image change in real time.
 
6. To quickly adjust the white 
balance, click the eyedropper 
in the White Balance section, 
and then click an area inside 
the image that should be pure 
white, black, or gray.
 
 After you click inside the 
image, the white balance 
changes. If you don’t like 
the results, click again. 
Alternatively, you can click the 
drop-down arrow and choose 
an option from the White 
Balance Adjustment drop-
down list. You can choose As 
Shot to return the image to the 
white balance determined by 
the camera or choose Auto to 
let Digital Photo Professional 
adjust the white balance. The 
same options found on your 
camera — Daylight, Cloudy, 
Shade, and so on — are also found in this drop-down list.
Figure 9-27: Using the Tool palette.

248
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
 If you’re really adventurous, click the Tune button to open a color wheel 
that you use to fine-tune the white balance and remove any colorcast. 
You may not get great results, so use this at your own risk.
 
7. Choose an option from the Picture Style drop-down list.
 
 The picture style the image was photographed with displays in the 
window. But these are RAW files, which can be folded, spindled, and 
mutilated. You can choose a different picture style from the drop-down 
list to change the look of the image.
 
8. Drag the Contrast, Highlight, and Shadow sliders to fine-tune these 
tonal areas.
 
 You can increase or decrease contrast for all tonal ranges. As you 
make your changes, the image updates in real time and the curve in the 
window above the sliders updates as well.
 
9. Adjust the Color Tone and Color Saturation sliders.
 
 Drag the sliders while reviewing the thumbnail.
 
10. Adjust image sharpness with the Sharpness slider.
 
 Drag the slider to increase image sharpness.
 
11. After you make your adjustments, close the Tool palette.
Digital Photo Professional doesn’t store the changes after you close the 
application. Therefore, you need to save the changes in another file format. 
When you launch Digital Photo Professional again, you can apply different 
edits to the RAW file and save the image with the new changes using a 
different filename. To save your edited work:
 
1. Choose File➪Convert and Save.
 
 The Convert and Save dialog box appears (see Figure 9-28).
 
2. Enter a filename and location for the edited image.
 
 If desired, you can use the same filename. The file format in which you 
can save the image won’t overwrite the RAW file. You can save the file 
in the same folder or create a new folder in which to store your edited 
images.
 
3. Choose a file type.

249
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
 You can save the file in any of the following formats:
 
• Exif-JPEG: Saves the edited image as a JPEG file.
 
• Exif-TIFF (8Bit): Saves the edited image as an 8-bit TIFF file.
 
• TIFF (16Bit): Saves the edited image as a 16-bit TIFF file. The file 
size of this format is considerably larger than the 8-bit TIFF format, 
but you have more information to work with if you edit the image 
in an application like Photoshop.
 
• Exif-TIFF (8Bit) + Exif-JPEG: Saves an 8-bit TIFF file and JPEG file.
 
• TIFF (16Bit) + Exif-JPEG: Saves a 16-bit TIFF file and an 8-bit JPEG 
file.
Figure 9-28: Converting a file to a different format and saving it.

250
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
 If you choose a JPEG option, you can specify the quality.
 
4. Accept the default JPEG quality of 10 or drag the slider to specify a 
different quality.
 
 The default setting of 10 produces a high-quality image at the expense of 
a large file size. If you specify a lower quality, the image quality is poorer 
and the file size is smaller. When you specify a lower quality, Digital 
Photo Professional compresses the file and data is lost.
 
5. Accept the default resolution of 350 dpi (dots per inch) or enter a dif-
ferent resolution.
 
 With most printers, you can get by with a resolution of 300 dpi.
 
6. Accept the default option to embed the ICC (International Color 
Consortium) profile or click the check box to reject the option.
 
 Your best option is to embed the profile with the image.
 
7. (Optional) Select the Resize check box.
 
 If you use this option, the Width and Height text boxes appear with the 
current dimensions of the image. The Lock Aspect Ratio check box is 
selected by default. If you deselect this option and change one value, the 
other value won’t change and the image won’t look right.
 
8. (Optional) Enter a new value for width or height.
 
 When you enter one value, Digital Photo Professional does the math and 
supplies the other value.
 
9. Click Save.
 
 Your changes to the image(s) are saved.
Using External Image Editors
You can edit images from ZoomBrowser EX in an external image-editing 
application, such as Photoshop. If you use ZoomBrowser EX to organize and 
download your images but want to use a more robust image-editing applica-
tion to edit your images, this is the ideal solution. You can also edit RAW 
images from Digital Photo Professional in Photoshop. This section shows you 
how to do both.

251
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
To launch Photoshop from ZoomBrowser EX:
 
1. Select the JPEG image you want to edit, click the Edit button, and 
then click Edit Image.
 
 The Pick Editor window appears.
 
2. Select the Edit with External Image Editor option (see Figure 9-29).
 
 Notice there are no options for the external editor. You need to show 
ZoomBrowser EX the location of your preferred image editor.
Figure 9-29: Editing with an external editor.
 
3. Click the Manage List button.
 
 The Manage Editing Tools dialog box appears (see Figure 9-30).

4. Click the Add button.
 
 The Open dialog box appears.
 
5. Navigate to the EXE file for your favorite image-editing application, as 
shown in Figure 9-31, and then click the Open button.
 
 The EXE file is listed on the Manage Editing Tools dialog box.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Your favorite image-editing application appears on the External Image 
Editor button (see Figure 9-32). You can add additional image editors 
by following Steps 3–6. The additional editors appear on the drop-
down list.

253
 Chapter 9: Editing Your Images
 
7. Click the External Image Editor button.
 
 Your image opens in your preferred image-editing application.
Figure 9-31: Adding an image editor to your editing tools.
When you install Digital Photo Professional, it detects applications, such as 
Photoshop, and adds the ability to edit the image in that application as a 
menu command. If you have an application that Digital Photo Professional 
recognizes, it appears on the menu. I have Photoshop installed on my 
computer so that’s the application Digital Photo Professional recognized. 
All I have to do to edit an image in Photoshop that I select in Digital Photo 
Professional is choose Tools➪Transfer to Photoshop. This opens the file as 
a 16-bit TIFF file in Photoshop.

Creating Prints from Your Images
In This Chapter

▶ Calibrating your monitor
▶ Finding and printing images

▶ Printing from ZoomBrowser EX and Digital Photo Professional
P
rinters have come a long way. Back when I started printing my own 
images, printer ink cartridges had three inks. Then printers gradu-
ated to cartridges with six inks. Now the really good printers have eight 
cartridges, which print stunning color as well as black and white prints. You 
can also get prints made at a wide variety of sources from your local 
drugstore or supermarket to an online printer that specializes 
in creating beautiful prints in sizes from 4 x 6 inches to as 
large as 36 x 24 inches.
Your camera has an 18-megapixel capture, which 
means you can create very large prints. In this chap-
ter, I explore the wonderful world of printing the 
images you capture in your EOS 7D.
To Print or Not To Print?
Modern photo-quality printers are a wonderful thing. 
They print rich, wonderful colors with crisp delineation 
among them. But good photo-quality printers don’t come 
cheap, and neither do the ink cartridges. Modern printers 
have multiple cartridges. If you’ve been printing a lot of images 
that use say, red or cyan ink, you’ll exhaust that cartridge much sooner 
than the other cartridges in your printer. And you never seem to have a 
spare cartridge of the color that runs out.

256
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
In addition to the problem of running out of ink at an inopportune moment, 
don’t forget the expense involved. If you use a third-party fine art paper, it 
soaks up ink like a sponge. Then when you run out of one color cartridge in 
the middle of a print job, you have a double whammy: You’ve wasted lots of 
ink and a sheet of very expensive paper. Fortunately you can get good color 
prints in lots of other ways. The following list shows a few options:
 
✓ Superstore printing services: Many superstores, such as Costco and 
Sam’s Club, have do-it-yourself printing. Simply bring a memory card 
to the store, put it in the machine, and review the images on the card. 
Many of the in-store kiosks have options like cropping images to a spe-
cific size. After you select images, you can place your order. In many 
instances, you can do your shopping in-store and come back an hour 
later for your prints.
 
✓ Drugstores: Many drugstores offer the printing of digital images. Simply 
bring your memory card to the store, insert it in their machine, choose 
the images you want to print, and place your order.
 
✓ Online printing services: Lots of online printing services offer many 
services. If you want standard prints, no problem. A full online printing 
service can print anything from wallet-size images to huge wall post-
ers. You say you want to put a picture of your cat on a coffee mug? 
No problem. Upload the image and you’ll get your cat’s mug on a mug 
within a matter of days. Other services include photo books, images on 
mouse pads, and so on. One of my favorite online printing sources is 
Mpix (www.mpix.com). They offer all the aforementioned services and 
much more.
Calibrating Your Monitor
When you make decisions regarding white balance, colorcasts, and other 
color issues with your images, you rely on what you see on your monitor. 
However, your monitor changes over time, which can result in a slight color 
shift. Yet you still rely on the monitor to accurately portray red, green, and 
blue in your photos. Then, you print the images on your computer printer 
or send them to an online printer, and the resulting print doesn’t look like 
what you saw on your monitor. That’s because your monitor isn’t accurately 
reproducing color and needs to be calibrated.
A lot of products are on the market for calibrating monitors. When you 
calibrate a monitor, you start the calibration software and then attach a 
colorimeter device to your screen. The software analyzes your monitor and 
compares the colors it generates to the accepted standards for red, green, 

257
 Chapter 10: Creating Prints from Your Images
and blue as stored with 
the software. After the 
software does its thing, it 
creates a profile that you 
use to get your monitor 
to accurately represent 
color. When you calibrate 
your monitor, do so with 
the same lighting condi-
tions you normally work 
in. After the initial cali-
bration, recalibrate your 
monitor every two or 
three months to compen-
sate for changes as your 
monitor ages. One popu-
lar monitor calibration 
kit is Pantone’s huey (see 
Figure 10-1). As of this 
writing, the huey retails 
for $89.
Finding Images
After you download lots of images and edit them, you end up with lots of 
images in lots of folders. Even though the folders are organized by date 
and they have the date as the actual folder name and even though you’ve 
renamed the images, looking for a single image, or group of images, is like 
looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. You can search for images 
by date photographed, date modified, star rating, comments, and keywords. 
You can choose any or all the criteria listed in the dialog box. However, you 
can easily find images with ZoomBrowser EX (see Chapter 9) by following 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Tools➪Search.
 
 The Search dialog box appears (see Figure 10-2).
 
2. Select the Match All Conditions or Match Any Condition option.
 
 If you choose the first option, ZoomBrowser EX returns images that 
match every criterion you enter. If you choose the latter, you find more 
images.
 
3. Select the Star Rating check box to search for images by star rating.
Figure 10-1: Calibrating your monitor.

258
Part III: Editing and Sharing Your Images 
 
 After you choose this option, a drop-down list becomes available. You 
can choose to search for one-, two-, or three-star images, one- and two-
star images, two- and three-star images, or one- and three-star images.
 
4. Select the Modification Date check box to search for images by the 
date they were modified.
 
 When you choose this option, you specify the start and end dates. You 
can manually enter the dates in each text box in the mm/dd/yyyy format 
or click the drop-down arrow to the right of each text box to reveal a cal-
endar, which you use to specify the date.
Figure 10-2: Where did I put that picture of Aunt Millicent?
 
5. Select the Shooting Date check box to search for images based on the 
day they were photographed.
 
 You specify the start and end dates the same way you do for the 
modification date.
 
6. Select the Comment check box to search for images based on com-
ments you entered.
 
 When you enable this option, you enter words that are contained in the 
comments of the images you want to find.
 
7. Select the Keywords check box to search by keyword.

259
 Chapter 10: Creating Prints from Your Images
 
 When you choose this option, the keywords you’ve used appear below 
the Keyword option. Select the check box to the left of a keyword to 
search for images that contain that keyword. You can search for mul-
tiple keywords.
 
8. Click the Next button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX searches for images based on the criteria you choose. 
This may take a while if you’re using several search options to find your 
images. A progress bar appears while ZoomBrowser EX searches. When 
the search is concluded, the images display in the dialog box.
 
9. Click the Finish button.
 
 The images returned by the search display in a window. You can review 
your images in the Zoom, Scroll, or Preview mode. The results are 
stored in the Search Results folder, which you find at the bottom of the 
folder tree in the All Folders tab. The contents of the Search Results 
folder change each time you perform a search.
Leaving Some Breathing Room
Your EOS 7D produces images 
with an aspect ratio of 3:2, which is 
perfect if you print your images on 
4-x-6-inch photo paper. However, if 
you print your images on different-
size papers, the aspect ratio of those 
papers doesn’t match the aspect 
ratio of your camera. For example, 
if you print images on 8-x-10-inch 
paper, the aspect ratio is 4:5. If you 
take a picture and don’t leave any 
breathing room at the edges, you 
can’t crop to 8 x 10 without cutting 
out part of your subject. When you 
take pictures, keep this in mind. 
Leave a little breathing room and 
you can crop to different aspect 
ratios without losing important 
parts of your image. Figure 10-3 
shows an image that has plenty of 
breathing room. The complete image 
is perfect for a 4 x 6 print. The red 
rectangle shows the image cropped 
for a 5-x-7-inch print, and the blue 
lines show the image cropped for 
an 8-x-10 inch print. Breathing room 
is a wonderful thing.

different aspect ratios.

Creating photo books at Blurb
If you want to see your images in a custom 
photo book, you can make this a reality by 
visiting Blurb (www.blurb.com). Blurb is a 
popular online Web site for creating and sell-
ing photo books. You can create a great-looking 
photo book with Blurb’s free BookSmart soft-
ware, which you can download for free from 
www.blurb.com/make/booksmart. 
After you use the software to create your book, 
you can upload the photos to Blurb directly from 
the BookSmart software. You can also create 
a custom book in an application like Adobe 
InDesign and then upload it to Blurb as a PDF 
(Portable Document Format). After you upload 
the book, you have 14 days to order at least one 
copy of it. If you don’t order a copy within 14 
days, Blurb removes it from the Web site. Blurb 
offers hardcover and softcover books in the 
following sizes (in inches): 7 x 7, 10 x 8, 12 x 12, 
and 13 x 10. You can also upgrade to premium 
paper, which looks absolutely stunning with 
high-resolution images. The minimum number 
of pages is 20, and the maximum number of 
pages you can put in a book is 440. You can 
put multiple photos on a page with BookSmart 
templates.
You can also choose to make your book public 
after you order one copy. When you make a 
book available to the public, you can specify 
the selling price. The following image is a 
copy of the book cover I created from images 
I shot at a local car show. Quite a few copies 
of this book have been ordered online. When 
your book sells, Blurb sends you the difference 
between your selling price and its established 
price minus a small handling fee.

 Chapter 10: Creating Prints from Your Images
Trimming an Image in ZoomBrowser EX
You can trim an image to get rid of unwanted pixels. When you crop an 
image, you end up with a smaller image size as well. To trim an image in 
ZoomBrowser EX:
 
1. Select the image you want to edit and then click the Edit button.
 
 The menu drops down to reveal the editing options.
 
2. Click Edit Image.
 
 The Editing dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the Trim option and click the Finish button.
 
 The Trim Image dialog box appears (see Figure 10-4). You have two 
methods of trimming an image. The first is to simply drag the handles 
until you’ve cropped away any unwanted pixels. This method is fine 
when you create an image for the Web or to send via e-mail. However, 
when you want to print an image on photo paper with set dimensions, 
you need to use the second method — crop to an aspect ratio from the 
Advanced Options choices. The following steps show you how to crop 
manually.
Image size and resolution considerations
Whether you print an image on your home com-
puter printer or use an online printing company, 
it’s important that you send them an image 
that’s large enough to print on the media size 
you choose. Also important, match the reso-
lution of the printer as closely as possible. To 
find the ideal resolution, check with the com-
pany that’s doing your printing or check your 
computer printer manual. If you’re printing the 
image, a resolution of 200 dots per inch (dpi) 
gives you acceptable results. If you choose a 
resolution of 300 dpi, you’ll get a better-looking 
image because the pixels are smaller and you’ll 
get a better color variation. So how does this 
equate to image size? If you want to print an 
8-x-10-inch image at 200 dpi, the image dimen-
sions must be 1600 x 2000 pixels, and of course, 
the image must have a resolution of 200 dpi. If 
you want to print an 8-x-10-inch image at 300 
dpi, your image must be 2400 x 300 pixels. To 
do the math for a different image resolution, 
multiply the size in inches by the resolution to 
get the document size in pixels. Your image 
should be larger than this. Unfortunately, nei-
ther ZoomBrowser EX nor Digital Professional 
Pro has a menu command to change the image 
size. If you have Photoshop Elements, you can 
easily perform this task. Photoshop Elements 8 
For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier and Ted 
Padova (Wiley), is a good book to reference.

 Drag any handle to trim the image to a different size. Click inside the trim 
box and then drag to move the box to trim to a different area of the image.
 
5. Click the Trim Image button.
 
 The image trims to size.
 
6. Click the Save As button and then in the Save As dialog box, follow 
the prompts to save the image.
Trimming an image in ZoomBrowser EX is an inexact science. Even if you use 
the advanced options, you can’t trim to a specific aspect ratio. If you need to 
trim your images to a specific size, trim them in Digital Professional Pro, as I 
outline in the following section.
Trimming an Image in Digital Professional Pro
When you need to trim an image to a specific aspect ratio, you can get the 
job done in Digital Professional Pro (which comes with your camera). In addi-
tion, you can trim RAW images, which isn’t possible in ZoomBrowser EX. To 
trim an image in Digital Professional Pro:

263
 Chapter 10: Creating Prints from Your Images
 
1. Select the image you want to trim and then choose Tools➪Start 
Trimming Tool.
 
 The image appears in the Trimming Tool dialog box (see Figure 10-5).
Figure 10-5: Trimming an image in Digital Professional Pro.
 
2. Click the Aspect Ratio drop-down arrow.
 
 The Aspect Ratio menu displays (see 
Figure 10-6).
 
3. Choose the desired ratio.
 
 Choose 2:3 for 4-x-6-inch images, or 4:5 for 
8-x-10-inch images. After you choose an 
aspect ratio, trimming handles (cropping 
for you purists) appear around the image. 
If you need a different aspect ratio, choose 
Custom. This opens two text boxes beneath 
the Aspect Ratio button, into which you 
enter the desired aspect ratio. For example, 
to trim for printing on 5-x-7-inch stock, 
enter 5 and 7.
 
4. Click and drag to define the area of the image that you want to trim.
 
 Trim handles appear around the selected area. The area that will be 
trimmed away has a semitransparent black mask (see Figure 10-7).

5. Fine-tune the area that the image will trim.
 
 You can drag any of the handles to change the size of the trim rectangle. 
Click inside the rectangle and you can drag it to another position.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The image is trimmed to the desired area.
Printing an Image
After you trim an image to size, time to print it. If you’re printing the image 
on your local printer, you can do so from within ZoomBrowser EX or Digital 
Photo Professional. You can print a single image or a contact sheet. I show 
you how in the upcoming sections.
Printing an image from ZoomBrowser EX
You can print an image you select in ZoomBrowser EX on your local printer. 
As I mention earlier, ZoomBrowser EX doesn’t let you trim to a specific 
aspect ratio, so your results may not be what you expect. To print an image 
from ZoomBrowser EX:

Printing an image in Digital Photo Professional
If you want to print RAW images, you can do so from Digital Photo Professional. 
The process is pretty straightforward. You can specify the printer and then 
modify the printer properties to suit the media you’re using. To print an image 
from Digital Photo Professional:
 
1. Launch Digital Photo Professional, select the image you want to print, 
and then choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box appears (see Figure 10-10).
Figure 10-10: Printing an image from Digital Photo Professional.
 
2. Choose the desired printer from the Name drop-down list.
 
 This menu shows every available printer on your computer or in your 
network.
 
3. Click the Properties button.
 
 A dialog box opens with the properties for your printer. You can specify 
the media being used, the layout, and so on. The dialog box varies 
depending on the printer you use. 

268

4. After choosing the desired options, close the dialog box.
 
5. Specify the number of copies to print.
 
6. If the image is larger than the media, select the Fit Image to Print Area 
check box, and then click the OK button.
 
 The selected printer prints your image.
Printing an Index Sheet in ZoomBrowser EX
You can print a contact sheet (known as an index sheet in ZoomBrowser 
EX) of selected images. The contact sheet is a handy reference that shows 
information about the photos as well as a thumbnail image for each photo. 
Many photographers file these as reference material. They’re also useful 
for showing images to prospective clients. After all, looking at an image 
tells you a lot more than looking at a filename. To print an index sheet in 
ZoomBrowser EX:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the images you want to 
include on the index sheet.
 
 If you choose RAW images, ZoomBrowser EX uses the thumbnail image 
for the index sheet because ZoomBrowser EX can’t decode RAW files. 
This may result in poor image quality.
 
2. Click the Print and E-Mail button, and then click the Index Print 
button.
 
 The Index Print dialog box appears (see Figure 10-11).
 
3. Choose a printer from the Name drop-down list.
 
 Your default printer is listed on the button.
 
4. Click the Properties button.
 
 A dialog box with the printer properties appears. The properties differ 
depending on what type of printer you use.
 
5. Set the printer properties and then click OK.
 
 The dialog box closes.

Using third-party papers
Lots of companies manufacture paper for print-
ing digital images. Some of them are more 
economical than the paper available from your 
printer manufacturer, and others are available 
to create fine art prints. For example, papers 
with a high rag content make your images look 
like artwork instead of photos. When you print 
images from an application, such as Photoshop 
Elements, the printer determines how much of 
each ink is laid on the paper to create the result-
ing image. However, when you use third-party 
paper (paper not manufactured by the company 
that made your printer), your printer has no way 
of knowing how much ink to lay to replicate what 
you see on your computer screen. When this is 
the case, you need to get an ICC (International 
Color Consortium) profile for the paper and your 
printer. Many manufacturers of fine art photo 
paper, such as Ilford and Hahnemuhle, have 
profiles you can download for your printer and 
their paper. They also supply instructions on 
where the profile needs to be stored on your 
system and how to use the profile with many 
popular image-editing applications, such as 
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements.

hen the weather is dismal and you’re fresh out of ideas for 
shooting macro or still life photography in your house, 
you can always photograph your pet rock. Or better yet, 
you can do some cool things with your camera, such as 
creating a custom menu or a custom picture style. In 
this chapter, I show you more than a handful of tips 
and tricks that you can do on a rainy day.
Creating a Custom Menu
Do you have a set of menu commands you use 
frequently? How cool would it be not to have to sift 
through all 4,000 commands in your camera menu? 
That’s right, you can cut to the chase and create your 
own custom menu with your very own favorite com-
mands. If I’ve piqued your curiosity, read on. To create a 
custom camera menu:

Manually Cleaning Your Sensor
Your camera has a self-cleaning sensor; however, you may inadvertently get 
a stubborn piece of dust that develops a magnetic attraction to your sensor 
and needs to be cleaned manually. To determine whether you have dust on 
your sensor, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Av (Aperture Priority) mode and choose your smallest 
aperture.
 
 For further information on using Aperture Priority mode and manually 
setting your aperture, see Chapter 6.
 
2. Switch the lens to manual focus and rack the focus to its nearest point.
 
 That’s right, you want the sky to be out of focus. That way the dust 
specks will show up as black dots.
 
3. Take a picture of a clear blue sky, download the picture to your com-
puter, and review it in your image-editing program at 100 percent 
magnification.
 
 If you see black specks in the image, you have dust on your sensor.

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Using sensor cleaning equipment
If you’re a DIY (do-it-yourself) kind of photog-
rapher, you may want to consider cleaning 
your sensor with commercially available prod-
ucts. Lots of products — brushes, swabs, and 
chemicals — that you use to manually clean 
the camera sensor are on the market. Yes, that 
does mean you physically touch the sensor with 
a product. Therefore, the product you choose 
needs to be made from material that can’t 
scratch the camera sensor. You must also have 
a very steady hand when using these products.
I’ve used sensor cleaning products manufac-
tured by VisibleDust (www.visibledust.
com). VisibleDust manufactures a lighted 
sensor loupe that you place over the lens open-
ing to examine the sensor for any visible dust — 
hence, the company name. The loupe is made of 
glass and makes it easy to see any specs of dust 
on your lens. VisibleDust also manufactures an 
Arctic Butterfly brush, which runs on two AAA 
batteries. To use this brush:
 1. Push a button to spin the brush.
 
 This gives the brush a static electricity 
charge.
 2. Brush the sensor once with the charged 
brush.
 
 Dust particles are attracted to the brush.
 3. Remove the brush from the camera body 
and then press the button to spin the brush 
again.
 
 This discharges the particles in the air.
 4. Use the brush as needed to remove any 
dust that may have accumulated on the 
sensor.
I’ve used both products with a good outcome 
on my cameras. For more information, visit 
www.visibledust.com or ask your favor-
ite camera retailer for information about these 
products.
The best way to clean dust off your sensor is to blow it off with a power-
ful bulb blower. Several blowers are on the market with generic names like 
Hurricane or Rocket. The Giottos Rocket Blaster is shown in Figure 11-8. 

285
 Chapter 11: Ten (Plus One) Tips and Tricks
A good blower is made of natural rubber and 
features a small opening at the tip that enables 
you to direct a strong current of air with pinpoint 
accuracy.
To clean the sensor manually, take the lens off 
the camera and then choose the Sensor Cleaning 
option from your camera menu. This flips up the 
mirror, giving you access to the sensor. Squeeze 
the bulb blower several times to send a rush 
of air to the sensor that hopefully dislodges 
the dust and sends it floating to the ground. I 
always point the camera down when cleaning 
the sensor, which lets the dust drop out of the 
camera after it’s dislodged.
 
Never touch the sensor with the blower. Never 
use a blower with a CO2 cartridge. CO2 cartridges 
contain propellants that can foul your sensor.
Creating and Registering a Picture Style
If you like to use picture styles in your photography, you’ll be glad to know 
that you can customize your favorite picture style. After customizing the pic-
ture style, you can register it as a User Defined picture style and it’s available 
whenever you want to use it for pictures. To customize a picture style:
 
1. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 You’re in picture-taking mode.
 
 
2. Press the Picture Style Selection button.
 
 
 The picture styles display on the camera LCD monitor.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to select one of the User Defined picture 
styles (see the left side of Figure 11-9).
 
 
4. Press the Info button.
 
 
 The Detail Set. dialog box displays (see the right side of Figure 11-9). 
The Picture Style option at the top of the menu enables you to select the 
style that is the basis for your custom style.

to the right of Standard (see the left side of Figure 11-10).
 
6. Rotate the Quick Control dial to select the picture set that’s the basis 
for your custom style and then press Set.
 
 The details for the picture set display on the camera LCD monitor (see 
the right side of Figure 11-10). You can customize the following:
 
• Sharpness: You can increase or decrease image sharpness.
 
• Contrast: You can increase or decrease the amount of contrast in 
the image.
 
• Saturation: You can increase or decrease color saturation.
 
• Color Tone: You can change the skin tone of people you pho-
tograph. You can make skin tones more yellow by moving the 
indicator to the left side of the scale, or more red by moving the 
indicator to the right side of the scale.

7. Customize image sharpness (the first on the list), or rotate the Quick 
Control dial to highlight another detail, and then press Set.
 
 The selected detail appears on the camera LCD monitor. You can now 
customize it (see the left side of Figure 11-11).
Figure 11-11: Customizing a picture style.
 
8. Rotate the Quick Control dial to increase or decrease the amount of 
the detail.
 
 Rotate the dial right to increase, or left to decrease.
 
9. Press Set.
 
 The change is applied, and you’re returned to the Detail Set menu.
 
10. Repeat Steps 5–9 to customize the other details in the picture style.
 
 Customize the details that make sense to the style you’re customizing. 
For example, you wouldn’t change Color Tones when customizing the 
Landscape picture style. The right side of Figure 11-11 shows a custom-
ized set that’s ready to be registered with the camera.
 
 11. Press the Menu button.
 
 
 Your custom picture style is registered. The text above the style shows 
the style on which your style is based; it also shows the changes you’ve 
made to the base style in blue.
You can also customize a Standard picture style. Follow the preceding steps 
but instead of selecting one of the User Defined styles, select one of the 
Standard styles and then press the Info button. Follow Steps 7–9 to customize 
the picture style to suit your taste.

Cleaning Your Camera
I address cleaning your camera sensor in the section, “Manually Cleaning 
Your Sensor,” earlier in this chapter; however, you also need to keep your 
lenses clean. I always inspect my equipment before a shoot, which is also 
when I clean the lenses I’ll be using. If a lens has smudges, fingerprints, or a 

290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
fine coating of dust and pollutants, your pictures won’t be crystal clear. Use 
a brush with fine hairs to dislodge any particles of dust and then gently rub a 
microfiber cloth over the lens. Make sure you purchase a good quality micro-
fiber cloth that’s designed to clean precision optics. I’ve purchased several 
lens cloths from Photosilk (www.photosilk.com).
Microfiber is 10 times thinner than 
silk, and 100 times thinner than a 
human hair. Photosilk’s cloths do 
an excellent job of keeping lenses 
clean. The cloths have a photo 
imprinted on one side. In fact, you 
can order Photosilk’s cloths with 
your own photographs printed on 
them. I’ve ordered several with my 
company logo emblazoned on the 
microfiber. Another option is to 
purchase a camera cleaning kit (see 
Figure 11-14) at your favorite camera 
retailer that comes with a blower, 
lens cleaning cloth, lens cleaning 
solution, and lens swabs.
You may also get some grime on 
your camera body. To clean your 
camera body, gently rub a damp 
nonabrasive cloth over the grime. Never use a solvent on your camera body 
because it may damage the material. If you use your camera in a salty envi-
ronment, such as the beach, thoroughly soak a cloth with fresh water and 
then wring it until it’s almost dry. Gently rub the slightly damp cloth over the 
camera body and lens.
Updating Your Camera’s Firmware
Canon is constantly making changes to make its cameras better. Canon 
locates any potential problems based on user input and its own tests, and 
then takes this information and modifies the camera’s firmware. Firmware is 
like the operating system for your computer. If you’ve registered your camera, 
Canon notifies you by e-mail when a firmware update is available. You can 
register your camera online or mail in the card provided with the camera 
documents. If you mail in the card, make sure you fill in the E-Mail section of 
the form to be notified of any changes. When you get the notification, follow 
the link to the firmware. You can also find out online if your camera has a firm-
ware update. Open your favorite Web browser and navigate to
Figure 11-14: Keep it clean.

Look at the Firmware section and you’ll see whether any updates are avail-
able for your camera. If an update is available, follow the prompts to down-
load the information to your computer. You then transfer the firmware 
program to a CF (CompactFlash) card to install it on your camera. Canon 
posts detailed instructions on how to install the firmware on one of the Web 
pages associated with the download.
 
Make sure you have a fully charged battery in your camera when you update 
firmware. If the battery exhausts itself during the firmware upgrade, you may 
permanently damage your camera.
Registering Camera User Settings
Everybody has a preferred way of working. That’s why you have preferences 
in computer programs and why you can register user settings to the Mode 
dial. The settings are available whenever you select a user setting on the 
camera Mode dial. For example, you may have custom settings that you use 
when you do flash photography, settings you use often but don’t use every 
day. You can register these settings and they’ll be there, even if you clear all 
camera settings. To register your favorite settings:
 
1. Use the camera menu to choose the settings you use frequently.
 
 For example, you can specify the image format and size, set up exposure 
compensation, or set any other settings you use frequently.
 
2. Rotate the Mode dial to select your preferred shooting mode.
 
 For example, you can rotate the dial to Av, if your favorite mode is 
Aperture Priority. After you select all your favorites, you’re ready to 
register them.
 
 
 
3. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
 
4. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera Settings 
3 tab.
 
 
5. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight Camera User Setting (see 
the left side of Figure 11-15) and then press the Set button.
 
 The Camera User Setting menu appears with the Register option high-
lighted (see the right side of Figure 11-15).

6. Press Set.
 
 The Register menu appears (see the left side of Figure 11-16).
 
7. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight the desired mode dial.
 
 A dialog box appears asking whether you want to register your settings 
to the selected mode dial (see the right side of Figure 11-16). If you have 
registered settings to a button previously, make sure you don’t select 
that button or you’ll override the previous settings.
Figure 11-16: Registering user settings.
 
8. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight OK and then press Set.
 
 Your settings are registered to the selected mode dial.

293
 Chapter 11: Ten (Plus One) Tips and Tricks
To erase user settings:
 
1. Follow Steps 3–5, select Clear Settings, and then press the Set button.
 
2. Select the mode dial you want to clear from the next menu and then 
press Set.
 
3. Highlight OK from the Clear Settings menu and then press Set to com-
plete the task.
Restoring Your Camera Settings
Sometimes you need to do some spring cleaning and wipe the slate clean. 
If you have more stuff on your camera than you care to deal with, or even 
know about, you can restore camera settings to factory defaults. This wipes 
out all your menu changes, your custom menu, and any picture styles you’ve 
registered or customized. So think twice before doing this. To restore your 
camera settings to the factory default:
 
 
 
1. Press the Menu button.
 
 The previously used menu displays.
 
 
 
2. Use the multi-controller button to navigate to the Camera Settings 
3 tab.
 
 
3. Rotate the Quick Control dial to select Clear All Camera Settings (see 
the left side of Figure 11-17) and then press Set.
 
 A dialog box appears asking you to confirm that you want to clear all 
settings (see the right side of Figure 11-17).
Figure 11-17: Clearing all your camera settings.

4. Rotate the Quick Control dial to highlight OK and then press Set.
 
 A dialog box appears telling you the camera is busy. When it stops, the 
camera settings have been cleared.
Keeping Your Memory Cards 
in Good Working Order
Memory cards are the digital equivalent of film that you use over and over 
again. But like any other piece of equipment, a memory card can fail. Here are 
a few tips to keep your cards in good working order:
 
✓ Always turn off the camera before removing a card. Removing a card 
with the power on could potentially damage the card.
 
✓ Make sure your camera has finished writing to the card before turn-
ing off the camera and removing the card. If the camera hasn’t finished 
storing the image on the card, you’ll lose the photo or worse yet, cor-
rupt the card.
 
✓ Always format your cards in the camera. Many image-editing applica-
tions let you format a card after downloading images; however, don’t 
accept this option. Your camera is best equipped to optimally format the 
card. Also, if for some reason your images didn’t download correctly, you 
still have the originals on your card. If you let the image-editing applica-
tion format the card and a glitch occurs in the download, your prized 
images are gone.
 
✓ Don’t run down your battery to a minimum charge. When your camera 
flashes a low battery warning, change the battery. If the camera battery 
becomes fully exhausted while the camera is writing data to the card, 
you may end up with a card full of corrupt data.

A
h, another Part of Tens chapter. You guessed it; a list about 
stuff you can do with your camera and the software that 
came with it. In this chapter, I show you some interesting 
things, such as adding text to images, creating abstract 
images, editing your images, and more. So if you’re up 
for extra bits of useful information, prop up your feet, 
get comfortable, and read on.
Adding Text to Images
You can add text to JPEG images with ZoomBrowser 
EX. When you add text, you can specify the font 
family, font size, and color. To add text to an image:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select a JPEG 
image.
 
2. Click the Edit button and then click Edit Image.
 
 The Editing dialog box appears.

296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Select the Insert Text option and then click the Finish button.

Figure 12-1: Inserting text.
 
4. Choose a font face from the Font Name drop-down list.
 
 The menu shows every font you have installed on your computer.
 
5. Choose a font size from the Font Size drop-down list.
 
 Alternatively, you can type the desired size in the text box.
 
6. Choose a color for the text by clicking the color swatch and then 
choosing a color from the Color Picker that appears.
 
7. Click inside the image where you want the text to appear and then 
type the text in the text box.
 
 The text appears inside the image surrounded by a bounding box. 
Note: After you add text to the image, the Import Comment and Import 
Shooting Date/Time buttons become available. Click the Import 
Comment button to add a comment associated with the image to the 
text box. Click the Import Shooting Date/Time button to add the date 
and time the photo was taken to the text box.

297

Figure 12-2).
 
9. Click the Save As button.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 
10. Follow the prompts to save the image.
Figure 12-2: Adding text to an image.
Saving Images to a CD
You can save images from ZoomBrowser EX to a CD. This is a convenient way 
to send photos to friends and relatives. To save images to a CD:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the images you want to save 
to CD.
 
2. Click the Export button and then click the Backup to CD button.
 
 The Backup to CD dialog box appears (see Figure 12-3).

4. Choose an option from the Speed drop-down list and then click the 
Finish button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX writes the selected files to disc.
Figure 12-3: Saving images to a CD.
Sending Images via E-Mail
E-mail is a great way to share your photos with friends. From within 
ZoomBrowser EX, you can attach images to an e-mail by using a supported 
e-mail application. To send images via e-mail, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the image you want to send 
via e-mail.

299
 Chapter 12: Ten (Plus One) Cool Projects
 
2. Click the Print and Email button and then click the Email Images 
button.
 
 The Email Images dialog box appears (see Figure 12-4).
 
3. Accept the recommended settings, or select the Using Custom Settings 
option and then click the Custom Settings button.
 
 The second option enables the Custom Settings button, which opens a 
dialog box that enables you to resize the image and then close the dialog 
box. The dialog box is self-explanatory, so I don’t waste any paper cover-
ing it.
 
4. Click the Calculate button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX calculates the file size of the attachment.
 
5. Click the Attach to Email button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX opens a blank e-mail from your default e-mail applica-
tion, if supported. All you need to do is add an e-mail address, subject, 
and message and then the image is ready to fly, Sly.

Exporting Shooting Properties
You can export the shooting properties of an image as a text file. This option 
is useful when you want to send a photo to another photographer and show 
him how you created the image. The shooting information is from the camera 
metadata, so you can send as much or as little information as you want. The 
information is exported as a text file. To export shooting properties:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the image from which you 
want to export shooting properties.
 
2. Click the Export button and then click the Export Shooting Properties 
button.
 
 The Export Shooting Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 12-5). All 
properties are selected by default.
 
3. Deselect any properties you don’t want to export and then click the 
Finish button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX exports the data as a text file.

Creating Computer Wallpaper
Photographers shouldn’t use the wallpaper that comes with their comput-
ers. The images you capture with your EOS 7D are bound to be much better 
than anything that shipped with your operating system. You can export 
wallpaper from any image you create. To create computer wallpaper from 
ZoomBrowser EX:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the desired image.
 
2. Click the Export button and then click the Export as Wallpaper button.
 
 The Export as a Wallpaper dialog box opens (see Figure 12-6).
 
3. Choose an installation setting.
 
 You can install the wallpaper centered on your screen, stretched to 
fit, or tiled; or you can choose not to install the wallpaper at all. If you 
choose the latter, the wallpaper is saved in the default directory in 
which your operating system stores wallpaper.
Figure 12-6: Exporting an image as wallpaper.

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
4. Accept the default filename, or select the Specify File Name and 
Folder option.
 
 If you select the latter, the Save As button becomes enabled. When 
you select this option, you can save the file in your default wallpaper 
directory but create several wallpaper files with different names. If you 
accepted the default filename, skip to Step 6.
 
5. Click the Save As button, and in the Save As dialog box that appears, 
accept the default location, enter the desired filename, and click Save.
 
 The default location is where your operating system looks for wallpaper.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 You have new wallpaper from your image (see Figure 12-7).

Creating a Computer Screensaver
Every computer uses a screensaver to prevent the screen burning the moni-
tor, although this isn’t much of an issue if you use an LCD monitor. Still, 
screensavers are cool things for your cat to look at while you’re away from 
your computer. (Just be careful not to create a screensaver with pictures of 
fish, lest your cat render your monitor into a smoldering heap while trying to 
catch the elusive fish on the monitor screen.) With ZoomBrowser EX, you can 
create a screensaver with your favorite images. Here’s how:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the desired images.
 
2. Click the Export button and then click the Export as a Screen Saver 
button.
 
 The Export as a Screen Saver dialog box appears (see Figure 12-8).
Figure 12-8: Exporting images as a screensaver.

304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Choose an option from the Resize Images drop-down list.
 
 Choose a size that’s slightly smaller than your desktop.
 
4. Click the Preview Screen Saver button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX teases you and flashes the first image. At least this 
gives you an idea of how large the screensaver will be.
 
5. Accept the default filename or click Save As.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX detects other screensavers it has created and appends 
the last filename with the next number.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 ZoomBrowser EX creates your screensaver.
Creating a Slide Show
When you’re reviewing images in ZoomBrowser EX, you may find it beneficial 
to view several images as a slide show. As the slide show runs, you see the 
images with a black background. To create a slide show in ZoomBrowser EX:
 
1. Launch ZoomBrowser EX and then select the desired images.
 
2. Click the View and Classify button and then click the View as Slide 
Show button.
 
 The Slide Show Setup dialog box appears (see Figure 12-9).
Figure 12-9: Creating a slide show.

305
 Chapter 12: Ten (Plus One) Cool Projects
 
3. Choose whether to loop the slide show.
 
 The default option plays the slide show one time. If you choose loop, it 
plays endlessly until you press the Esc key.
 
4. Choose a transition.
 
 This is the transition from one slide to the next. Click a transition and 
you’ll see a preview in the small image window.
 
5. Select an Image Size option.
 
 Best Fit is the best option. Your EOS 7D images are larger than any desk-
top size I’ve encountered.
 
6. Select an Image Information option.
 
 You can display no information, show image information such as star 
ratings, or show slide show controls only.
 
7. Select an Advance to Next Slide option.
 
 If you’re showing the slide show to friends, choose the mouse left-click 
option. This gives you a chance to talk about the image before you 
advance to the next slide. If you prefer the silent approach, accept the 
default three-second option. If you want the show to play longer, drag 
the slider to the right so that the display duration becomes longer.
 
8. Click the Finish button.
 
 The slide show starts playing. You can use the controls to pause, 
resume, advance to the next or previous slide, and exit the slide show.
Creating a Makeshift Tripod
Your EOS 7D can capture images in very low-light conditions. However, at 
times, you absolutely can’t do without a tripod. But what do you do when 
you’ve left home without one? Here are some ways you can steady your 
camera without a tripod:
 
✓ Switch to Live View mode and place the camera near the edge of a 
table. If you can see the tabletop in the viewfinder or LCD monitor, 
move the camera closer to the edge.
 
✓ Hold the camera against a wall. Use this technique when you rotate the 
camera 90 degrees (also known as Portrait mode).
 
✓ Lean against a wall and spread your legs slightly. This is known as the 
human tripod. Press the shutter button gently when you exhale.

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Use a small beanbag to steady the camera. You can just throw the 
beanbag in your camera bag; it doesn’t take up much space. Place your 
camera on the beanbag and move it to achieve the desired composition. 
You can purchase beanbags at your local camera store.
 
 As an alternative to the bean bag, you can carry a baggie filled with 
uncooked rice (cooked rice is messy and will spoil) in your camera bag. 
Place your camera on the bag and move it until you achieve the desired 
composition.
In addition to using one of these techniques, use the 2-Second Self-Timer. 
This gives the camera a chance to stabilize from any vibration that occurs 
when you press the shutter button. These techniques are also great when 
you’re on vacation and don’t have the room to carry a tripod in your 
baggage.
Creating Abstract Images in the Camera
When you stretch the envelope, you can create some very cool images with 
your camera. I read an article about a technique where the photographer 
walked with the camera while taking a picture at a very slow shutter speed. I 
loved the technique and decided to take it to the next level. I’ve dubbed this 
technique Drive-By Shooting. This technique involves creating a photo while 
you’re a passenger in a vehicle. To create an abstract image:
 
1. Ask a friend or relative to drive you somewhere.
 
 This technique works best after the sun’s set. Choose a place with a lot 
of traffic. You’re after the headlight patterns.
 
2. Attach the desired lens to the camera.
 
 Don’t use a wide-angle lens; this would include part of the car interior in 
your shot. Choose a lens with a focal length that’s the 35mm equivalent 
of 80mm or greater.
 
3. Rotate the Mode dial to Av (Aperture Priority).
 
 You’re using the aperture to control how long the shutter is open.
 
 
4. Press the ISO/Flash Compensation button and then rotate the Main 
dial to set the ISO speed to 100.
 
 You want the shutter to be open for a long time. The lowest ISO set-
ting makes the camera less sensitive to light requiring a longer shutter 
speed.

307
 Chapter 12: Ten (Plus One) Cool Projects
 
5. Rotate the Main dial to specify the smallest aperture (highest f-stop 
value) for the lens you’re using.
 
 This ensures the shutter will be open for a long time.
 
6. Wait until your friend drives near a lot of traffic that’s moving.
 
 You want lots of lights in the image. You can try this technique on a 
busy city street or a freeway. Another option is to take the picture when 
your friend drives away from a traffic light.
 
7. Press the shutter button halfway.
 
 The camera achieves focus. If the camera can’t achieve focus, switch the 
lens to manual focus and then focus by rotating the focus ring on the lens.
 
8. Press the shutter button fully.
 
 The shutter opens, and the picture is taken. Depending on the ambient 
light, your lens may be open for several seconds.
 
9. Rotate the camera.
 
 This is painting with light. When you rotate the camera, or move it 
up and down or from side to side, you create abstract patterns (see 
Figure 12-10).
Figure 12-10: Creating an abstract image in camera.

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
10. Edit your pictures.
 
 When you edit images in an application like Photoshop or Photoshop 
Elements, you can use filters to tweak the images. Figure 12-11 shows an 
abstract image created using this technique and edited in Photoshop.
Figure 12-11: A tweaked abstract image.
Editing Your Images in Photoshop Elements
The software Canon provided with your EOS 7D will get the job done. But 
if you want a really powerful image-editing application on a beer budget, 
consider purchasing Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0. This image-editing 
powerhouse gives you the power to manage your images, work with mul-
tiple keywords, find images, and much more. And that’s just the Organizer 
(Windows) or Bridge (Macintosh). Elements also has a module editing tool 
that is three pronged and powerful: Guided Edit Panel, Edit Quick mode, and 

309
 Chapter 12: Ten (Plus One) Cool Projects
Full Edit mode. If you’re new to image editing, the Guided Edit panel guides 
you through the image-editing process. If you want the quick, down, and Dirty 
Harry version of the Editor, use the Edit Quick mode. As the title implies, this 
version enables you to quickly edit an image. If you want the full-course treat-
ment from soup to nuts, edit your images in the Edit Full mode.
Photoshop Elements 8.0 gives you the power to crop, resize, color-correct, 
and adjust your image. If you’re in an artsy-farsty state of mind, you’ll 
find a plethora of filters you can use to edit your images. You can also use 
third-party filters, such as Nik Software, Alien Skin, and so on. Photoshop 
Elements 8.0 is too cool for school (see Figure 12-12). As of this writing, 
the application sells for a meager $79.99. So much power for such a small 
investment is a great deal, Lucille.

Strutting Your Stuff Online
Everybody likes to show off their work, and you can do this online in quite a 
few places. The Granddaddy of photo-sharing sites is Flickr (www.flickr.
com). This site enables you to post your images online, but it’s more than just 
a photo-sharing site; it’s a community, as well. You can send your Flickr URL 
to other photographers to show off your work. Other members of the Flickr 
community can comment on your work. You can set up a free account and 
start uploading images to your personal gallery (see Figure 12-13).
Figure 12-13: Showing your stuff on Flickr.
Another great photo-sharing Web site is SmugMug (www.smugmug.com). 
This site isn’t free, but it’s very reasonable. As of this writing, you can set up 
a Standard SmugMug gallery for $39.95 per year. Other options are the Power 
gallery for $59.95 per year or the Pro gallery for $149.95 per year. Figure 12-14 
shows an example of a Power gallery. For more information on SmugMug,
