Introduction
C
hronic pain is pain that lasts for more than three months. It’s stunningly
common: One in three people have this type of pain.
If you have chronic pain, you’re all too familiar with the constant intrusions it
can make into your everyday life. However, you don’t need to suffer. We
wrote this book to give you tools to tame this unwelcome trespasser.
You can — and will — feel a lot better when you educate yourself about your
condition, track your pain triggers, and use sound medical, complementary,
and lifestyle approaches to control your chronic pain. These approaches
work for many people, returning them to vitality and health. They can work
for you, too.
About This Book
Our goals in writing this book are to help you understand and conquer your
chronic pain. We give you the perspectives of a compassionate doctor, an
avid researcher, and an informed chronic pain patient.

Chronic Pain For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we assumed that you or a loved one has chronic pain.
We also assume that you believe that knowledge is power and that you want
to be armed with this power in order to conquer your pain.
How This Book Is Organized
Chronic Pain For Dummies is organized into six convenient parts.
Part I: Getting the Lowdown 
on Chronic Pain
In Part I, we paint the big picture of pain. We give you an overview of chronic
pain and explain how it can be a disease all its own.
Because understanding the basics about the physical processes of pain can
help you understand and adapt to your situation, in Chapters 2 and 3 we look
at how pain develops inside your body. We also cover two important lifestyle
consequences of chronic pain — chronic pain behavior cycles and caregiver
stress. The first affects the person with chronic pain, and the second affects
the loved one taking care of her.
Part II: Detailing Some 
Causes of Chronic Pain
Part II is where we describe the major diseases and injuries that can lead to
chronic pain, as well as how these causes are diagnosed and treated. We pro-
vide details on the most common conditions that cause pain. But, remember:
Just because you hurt all the time doesn’t mean that you have one of these
conditions!
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically
In Part III, we cover the medical management of pain — from building your
health-care team to considering surgery. Along the way, we give you the details
about the benefits and side effects of a wide range of drugs used against chronic

pain. We also give you guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness and legitimacy
of complementary and alternative approaches to treating pain.
Part IV: Managing Your 
Pain with Lifestyle
Part IV gives you important suggestions for managing your chronic pain with
your lifestyle. You should use these techniques in conjunction with the med-
ical management of your condition. We also discuss how weight control and
good nutrition directly affect your level of chronic pain and how to avoid a
physical state known as deconditioning. We also cover the major sleep prob-
lems that can occur when you’re in constant pain and what you can do about
them. We present tools you can use to turn negative thoughts around and
reduce your pain. Finally, we know that living with chronic pain means having
to deal with the daily stress it creates. So, we provide information about tech-
niques you can use to ease your stress levels.
Part V: Understanding Pain 
Throughout the Life Cycle
Part V presents helpful information about chronic pain at three important
points in the life cycle: in children, the elderly, and at the end of life. Pain
during each of these stages of life manifests itself in its own way and requires
different solutions than during adulthood. So, we give you practical advice on
detecting and managing pain during these critical times.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part covers helpful tips in lists of ten. We provide information on phony
products and services that claim to cure chronic pain, sexuality and chronic
pain, important sources of pain help, and ten things to avoid when you have
chronic pain.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons we use in each chapter provide helpful information about the sen-
tences or paragraphs that they appear next to.

Introduction

The tip icon gives practical suggestions that you can use to manage your
chronic pain.
This icon marks information that it is important for you to pay attention to
and remember.
This warning icon warns you against something that could be harmful.
This icon marks a section that you can skip if you want to! It includes medical
jargon that you don’t really have to know to understand a topic.
Where to Go from Here
Chronic Pain For Dummies is a reference book. You don’t have to read every
page in order from the front to the back. And you don’t have to remember
anything from an earlier section to understand a later section.
However, you may want to read the first couple of chapters to get a basic
understanding of chronic pain and then read the chapters or sections that
apply to your specific chronic pain condition. (For example, if your problem is
endometriosis, be sure to read Chapter 10. If your pain is caused by cancer, be
sure to read Chapter 12.) Then use the Table of Contents or Index to find the
chapters or topics most relevant to you.
For example, if you find that your current medications just aren’t cutting the
pain, go to Chapter 14 and look up the other options now available. Or would
you like to know where to find a chronic pain support group? If so, go to
Chapter 28, which gives you a handy list of resources. Or maybe you have a
child with chronic pain and you want to know how to monitor her pain levels.
Be sure to check out Chapter 23. One final note: Because the field of pain
management is advancing very quickly, we also suggest that you use the
extensive resources that we have listed in this book to find out about and
stay on top of any new discoveries, techniques, and services that can help
you tame your chronic pain.

Chronic Pain For Dummies 

Part I
Getting the
Lowdown on
Chronic Pain

In this part . . .
W
hen you have chronic pain, your sensations can
range from a small constant ache to excruciating
and unrelenting pain. And these symptoms can be persis-
tent, resistant, and insistent! The pain is always with you
on some level, and it’s often isolating.
In this part, we paint the big picture of chronic pain and
how such annoying and nasty symptoms occur. We also
celebrate the advances that have been made in the last
couple of decades in managing chronic pain.
Because understanding the basics about the physical
processes of pain can help you adapt to your situation, 
we describe pain pathways and other aspects of how pain
works inside your body. We also describe the different
types of chronic pain and cover two important lifestyle
consequences of the problem: chronic pain behavior
cycles and caregiver stress.

Chapter 1
Hurting That Doesn’t Go Away
In This Chapter
 Understanding the solitude of chronic pain
 Recognizing common features
 Coping with chronic pain
C
hronic pain is hurting that doesn’t go away. But, as crazy as it sounds,
suffering from chronic pain today is much better than developing the
problem even ten years ago, when many doctors were afraid to give you pain
meds. And dealing with chronic pain is certainly much better than a couple of
centuries ago, when you may have had your veins opened to bleed the “bad
humors” out of your body.
This chapter gives you an overview of what we know today about chronic
pain — how it works, what it feels like, and how to manage it. We also cover
the common characteristics of chronic pain and discuss how constant pain
causes its own physical problems.
Just What Is Chronic Pain?
Medical professionals categorize pain as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is
your nervous system’s way of alerting you to an injury or other damage to your
body’s tissues (see Chapter 2). Acute pain gets your attention so that you’ll
take care of yourself fast. In fact, the word acute comes from the Latin word for
needle, and if you’ve ever stepped on a needle, you’ll agree that it’s a good rep-
resentation of acute pain. Acute pain usually goes away as the injury heals,
although it may return for short periods.
Chronic pain is persistent pain. The word chronic comes from the Greek word
for time. In medical terms, pain is chronic when it lasts three months or more.

8
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 
When pain becomes chronic, your body’s pain signals keep firing for weeks,
months, or years, even though the damage that set them off may have long
since healed (see Chapter 2). The pain may have been caused by an injury,
and, for unknown reasons, your body never turned off its pain switch. Or the
pain may have an ongoing cause, such as arthritis, cancer, or nerve damage
(see Part II). You also may have multiple causes of chronic pain, which is par-
ticularly common for older adults.
One big difference between acute and chronic pain is when you have acute
pain, you usually know why it hurts. (Some examples of acute pain are broken
bones, kidney stones, and childbirth.) When you have chronic pain, you may
have no idea what’s causing the hurting. The bone has healed, the stone has
passed, and the baby is now walking and talking, but you still have lingering
problems in the areas where the acute pain occurred.
In addition, many people with chronic pain aren’t even aware that an injury
ever occurred in the first place. (And, indeed, maybe there was no injury to
begin with!) For them, the pain appears to slam in from out of the blue, like a
sudden tornado that levels a house.
Whether you know the source, chronic pain is a sensation without purpose. It
has no biological function, and its usefulness as a warning system has long since
passed or never existed. Ironically, while chronic pain has no purpose, it’s still
often difficult to treat. The medical term for this type of pain is treatment resis-
tant pain. Experts at the Cleveland Clinic describe chronic pain this way: It per-
sists, resists, and insists: It persists beyond the expected healing time, resists
interventions (treatments), and it also insists upon being recognized.
Chronic Pain Is a Solitary Experience
Life with chronic pain is a solitary, and often lonely, experience. Compare this
hypothetical experience to that of chronic pain:
Pain: The fifth signal
In the past, pain was often overlooked or
ignored by doctors and other health-care pro-
fessionals because it couldn’t be measured, and
they couldn’t do much about it. Doctors treated
the condition causing the pain and not the pain
itself. However, that approach is changing so
that now both the condition and the pain that it
causes receive equal attention.
In fact, the concept that pain is a fifth vital sign
is now a mainstream idea. Four vital signs —
temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pres-
sure — are routinely taken by medical profes-
sionals to determine how a patient is doing. Pain
becomes the fifth measure of a patient’s status.

You and your husband are hiking in the mountains and get stuck in a cold,
hard rain. You have five miles to go to reach your car. Lunch was four hours
ago, and in your pack is only 8 ounces of water, chewing gum, and an apple.
And, oh yeah, you forgot your raincoats. (This stuff actually happens to
otherwise smart people.) So you just keep going. And going. And going. And
the cold hard rain never stops.
Two and a half hours later, you finally reach your car. When you arrive, you
each know how the other feels. You’re both exhausted, cold, wet, and
hungry. And you’re both very relieved that you lived through the experience
and your heated cabin — the one with the hot tub — is only a mile away.
Later that night, you share a good, long laugh about the experience. For
years, you two enjoy telling the story of “the day we almost died on the
mountain.”
Chronic pain is very different from this shared experience. You’re up on that
mountain all alone. And when you return to your cabin, there may be no heat
and no hot tub. And there’s no shared laughter.
Yes, chronic pain is a solitary experience. Each person feels chronic pain dif-
ferently, even people who have identical injuries or illnesses. Consider good
friends Lou and Matt. They both have a nerve condition called peripheral
neuropathy (see Chapter 11). Lou’s symptoms are nerve pain, tingling, and
numbness. Matt’s symptoms are muscle cramps and frequent falls due to loss
of muscle control. They both know that the other person has chronic pain
from the same disease he has, but their symptoms are very different.
Because pain is so subjective, it can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There’s
no blood test for pain, no pain urinalysis, no pain pulse. It’s up to you — in
your role as a chronic pain patient — to describe your pain to doctors and
other medical professionals who work to help you. The good news is that
there are many effective ways to deal with chronic pain, which we cover
throughout this book, but particularly in Parts III and IV where we cover man-
aging and living with chronic pain.
Checking Out Common Characteristics 
of Chronic Pain
Chronic pain is a solitary experience, yet it’s also a universal one. About one
in three Americans suffer from chronic pain. (Read more about the numbers
of people with chronic pain in Chapter 3.)
9
Chapter 1: Hurting That Doesn't Go Away

How do you tell when your pain is chronic? The Cleveland Clinic and other
prestigious medical institutions have identified specific characteristics of
chronic pain, including the following:
 Your pain doesn’t go away.
 You’ve had lots of medical “work-ups,” and yet no cause for the pain has
been identified.
 You’ve tried lots of different medicines to control your pain, and yet the
pain doesn’t go away.
 You may have undergone numerous surgeries, and yet your pain still
doesn’t go away.
 You’ve visited doctors or other health providers over and over again in
an attempt to find relief, but your search for relief has been futile.
10
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 
Chronic pain: Making headway every day
Scientists and the medical community are con-
tinually learning about what causes chronic
pain, and we can celebrate these advances in
understanding the following points:
 Scientists and the medical community have
amassed tremendous knowledge about the
causes of chronic pain, including new
research that shows that extended periods
of pain change the physiology of the central
nervous system. This knowledge impels
doctors to address pain problems swiftly
and effectively when they occur so that
they don’t lead to chronic pain.
 Research and advances in medical treat-
ment of pain-causing conditions have dra-
matically improved treatment for many
painful conditions, such as rheumatoid
arthritis and fibromyalgia.
 Organizations such as the American Chronic
Pain Association help sufferers with the
latest information on treatments, support
groups, advocacy efforts, and more.
(Chapter 28 includes a contact list of these
resources.)
 Pain management receives much more
attention in medical schools, which means
newbie docs are better armed to tackle
chronic pain. Some states require comple-
tion of an educational program in pain man-
agement to receive a medical license.
 Acceptance of using opiates to control
severe chronic pain, when appropriate, has
greatly reduced unnecessary suffering for
many people.
 Many new pain treatments are on the hori-
zon. For example, researchers are studying
new classes of drugs to treat pain more
effectively. They’re also looking at the pos-
sibility of implanting cells that release pow-
erful painkillers in the spinal cord. If you
have severe back pain, you may be ready to
sign up for this treatment now! But, unfor-
tunately, it’s not available yet. In another five
to ten years, expect major breakthroughs.

Don’t worry if these symptoms don’t apply to you. They don’t make your
chronic pain more or less real. (In fact, you should be glad. Who wants them?)
People with chronic pain also may have the following symptoms: tense, tight
muscles; an inability to get around; a lack of energy/fatigue; changes in appetite;
sleep problems; depression, anger and/or anxiety; and fear of further injury.
What Chronic Pain Feels Like
If you have chronic pain, at some point, you realized part of your body has
been hurting way too long. Maybe you have ongoing pain in your hip, and
you’re beginning to limp. When you first noticed the pain, you thought it was
related to that day you fell on the ice in the driveway. But that was a year ago.
Your bruised hip has long since healed, and yet the pain is still with you. You
go to the doctor, who takes an X-ray and discovers that you have significant
arthritis in your hip, which was probably irritated by the fall, but is a prob-
lem on its own.
In another example, your daughter, age 4, comes home from a Halloween
party with a crushing headache. You attribute it to a sugar overdose. You
take care of her, and she recovers. But a couple of weeks later, she has
another severe headache. And three weeks after that, she has yet another
one. Her pediatrician eventually diagnoses your child with chronic migraine
headaches.
Chronic pain is not only persistent, resistant, and insistent, but it also seems
ruthless. It’s always with you on some level. It either doesn’t give you a break,
or it gives you very brief respites, fooling you into thinking you’re all better
and then returning with a wallop — regardless of whether you have an impor-
tant sales presentation that afternoon, it’s your son’s birthday, or your plane
to the Caribbean is about to take off.
Sensations of chronic pain range from a small, constant ache to excruciating
pain. Your chronic pain may feel like one or more of the following feelings:
aching, burning, crushing pain, dull pain, electrical-like pain, flu-like symp-
toms, jabbing pain, mental fogginess, numbness, piercing, prickling, sharp
pain, shooting pain, soreness, stiffness, stinging sensations, throbbing, tight-
ness, tingling, or vise-like pain.
Most people with chronic pain experience more than one of these feelings. For
example, many people with fibromyalgia (see Chapter 4) have flu-like pain,
aching, and stiffness. And people with rheumatoid arthritis (also covered in
Chapter 4) may struggle with aching, stiffness, weight loss, and mental fogginess
(a term used to describe confusion and forgetfulness).
11
Chapter 1: Hurting That Doesn't Go Away

Educating Yourself on How Pain Works
Why are you having pain? What’s happening physically? Pain is caused by an
exchange of information between three major systems in your body: your
peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain. (Chapter 2 covers these systems in
more detail.)
Peripheral nerves contain fibers that bring pain impulses to the spinal cord.
Many of them have ends that sense danger, such as a cut or burning. These
fibers are called nociceptors, and you have millions of them throughout your
body.
Different types of nociceptors have different jobs. For example, some, noci-
ceptors detect heat, while others watch out for pricks of pain, and still others
respond to pressure. Once they detect these qualitative sensations, nocicep-
tors then send pain signals to your spinal cord.
Your spinal cord is home to special cells that either wave the signals on
through to the brain or turn them away like a door slamming shut on a gate.
Your spinal cord cells also release chemicals during this alert phase. (You can
read a discussion of this whole process in Chapter 2.)
The pain signals that are waved through to your brain arrive at the thinking
and emotion centers where your brain then decides what on earth is causing
the problem, whether it’s worth getting anxious about, and what, if anything,
to do about it.
Sometimes this complicated pain system crashes, kind of like a malfunction-
ing computer, yet the electricity keeps humming because the power’s still on.
The result is that your nerve/spinal cord system continues to send danger
signals to your brain even though the real threat has long since passed (or
maybe never existed in the first place).
Of course, this section describes chronic pain in a very rudimentary way. You
can read more about the inside workings of pain in Chapter 2. (You need to
know some basics about the pain enemy before you can vanquish her!)
Chapter 3 also covers chronic pain in general.
Constant Pain Causes Its Own Damage
Constant pain causes its own damage, and medical science is just beginning
to understand just how toxic the effects are. In fact, many pain experts say
that the pain has become its own disease.
12
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

What happens is that the presence of pain changes the peripheral nerve/
spinal cord/brain system that we mention in the previous section, causing
the pain itself to get worse. As a result, treating the pain, as well as the under-
lying disease or injury, is key to preventing even more pain. (You can read
more about this idea in Chapter 2.)
Living with Chronic Pain
The fact that pain is subjective and complicated means that it’s up to you to
take charge of your own care and treatment. You should understand enough
about what causes your pain so that you can be on top of the best treatments
(see Part II).
You also should discover how to do as much for yourself as you can, including
the following:
 Developing a great pain management team (see Chapter 13)
 Tracking and avoiding your own individual pain triggers (see Chapter 17)
 Relieving your pain with lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a
nutritional diet, exercising, and minimizing stress (see Part IV)
Managing your pain medically
When you have a chronic pain condition, you need to take control and gather
a team of experts to help you find relief. (See Chapter 13 to find out how to
assemble this team.) You need to find medical professionals and paraprofes-
sionals who will work with you on different aspects of your pain condition.
(Think of them as your own anti-pain team.)
For example, your group may include a primary-care physician (PCP), a special-
ist such as a neurologist or rheumatologist, and perhaps a physical therapist
and a dietician. Your team also may contain some alternative practitioners,
such as an acupuncturist or massage therapist. (Read more about alternative
means to alleviating your chronic pain in Chapter 15.)
Your pain management team should work with you to find the right medicines
and treatments that give you pain relief. (You can read more about medications
for chronic pain in Chapter 14.)
Some people with chronic pain may need surgery, which is a tough decision
for anyone to make. Read Chapter 16 for advice on how to make the choice
for or against surgery.

Chapter 1: Hurting That Doesn't Go Away

Helping yourself with lifestyle changes
Your chronic pain can be made better or worse by your lifestyle. Not eating a
healthy diet, being under- or overweight, not getting adequate exercise on a
regular basis, and being stressed out can all make your pain worse. Chapter 3
and other s in Part IV cover many aspects of lifestyle and its relationship to
pain. Here are the key concepts:
 Track your pain triggers and avoid them. Pain triggers are things in your
life — such as overdoing exercise or missing too many hours sleep — that
can set off a pain cycle. Keeping a pain log can help you identify your par-
ticular pain triggers. When you know what your own personal pain trig-
gers are, you can avoid them, and you’ll feel better! See Chapter 17 to
learn a variety of techniques for keeping track of your pain triggers.
 Purge “empty calories” from your diet and follow sound nutritional
principles. The key principle of a healthy diet is to eat a well-balanced
variety of wholesome foods so that you’ll take in all the nutrients required
for good health and disease prevention. A healthy diet also means only
occasionally eating white rice, white bread, potatoes, white pasta (pasta
made from refined flour), soda, and sweets for special occasions. Check
out Chapter 18 for more information on how to follow a nutritional diet.
 Get physical! If you don’t get adequate exercise for an extended period
of time (weeks, months, or longer!), you develop a physical state called
deconditioning. The No. 1 rule for exercise and chronic pain is to do as
much as you can as often as you can. (For more on exercise and chronic
pain, read Chapter 19.)
 Develop sound sleeping habits and beat fatigue. Sleep loss can make you
much more sensitive to pain. One study found that sleep deprivation
caused by continuous sleep disturbances throughout the night increased
spontaneous pain and impaired the body’s ability to cope with it. Chapter
20 gives you information about major sleep problems that can cause or
aggravate pain and what you can do about them.
 De-stress your life. When you have chronic pain, every day you must
deal with the stress it creates. The best approach is to curb your stress
as much as you can, whenever you can. From meditation to praying,
numerous techniques can help reduce both your stress and pain. Read
Chapter 22 to discover other stress-reduction techniques.
14
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

 Cope with aging demands. Are you older than 65? Sadly, the older you get,
the more likely you are to suffer from some form of chronic pain. This news
doesn’t mean you should just give up and park your chair permanently in
front of the TV! Absolutely not! Read Chapter 24 for great ideas about how
to cope with the pain that often comes with aging.
 Help your child in pain. Few sights are more heartbreaking than watching
a child in pain. If you’re a parent, you wish you could take on your child’s
pain yourself, but you know you can’t do that. Read some helpful advice
on how you can help your child in Chapter 23.
Researching what’s causing your pain
If you’ve been diagnosed with a condition causing your pain — such as migraine
headaches (see Chapter 6), fibromyalgia, or post herpetic neuralgia — it’s
important to find out more about the disease and the best ways that your
doctor can help you treat it. This knowledge ensures that you’re doing every-
thing possible to reduce your pain. If you don’t have a diagnosis of what’s
causing your pain, it’s important to seek one.
Part II covers the most common causes of chronic pain, ranging from arthritis 
(4) to back pain (5) to cancer (12.). These s describe symptoms of the diseases
and give you the latest information on finding the best medical specialists to
assist you.
If you’ve suffered a serious injury or a stroke, be sure to read Chapter 7 for
advice on this chronic pain problem. Is severe burn pain your problem?
Check out Chapter 8.
Some people never discover the cause of their pain, which is frustrating for
everyone involved, from the patient to the doctor. For example, back pain,
even when it’s severe, is notorious for not displaying any known cause during
a physical examination by a doctor, on imaging tests such as magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scans and X-rays, or even during surgery. The pain is
real, but it’s not easily detectable.
Even if you don’t know the source of your pain, it’s important to work with a
medical team to make sure that you’re maximizing your options for treatment.
(See Chapter 13 to find out how to assemble your anti-pain team.)

f you suffer from chronic pain, you probably perceive pain as your con-
stant enemy and may wonder what on earth has gone wrong with your
body. How did pain transform itself from a friendly, early warning system 
into a chronic troublemaker? This chapter helps answer these questions 
by exploring the physical aspects of chronic pain.
Understanding the basics of how your nervous system processes pain can
also help you understand and adapt to your own situation. Your pain isn’t
merely a bad sensation. It also motivates (or demotivates) you. It produces
strong emotions and its own set of reflexes. For example, pain can wake you
up from the deepest sleep if it’s severe enough. These effects occur because
your pain pathways commingle with all parts of your nervous system. This
chapter also explores this phenomenon.
Touring the Nervous System
The first step toward understanding the physiology of pain is to consider
how pain signals travel from the location of an injury to your brain, where
feelings of pain are formed. This knowledge provides you with a framework 
to comprehend how malfunctions can occur along the route (the pain 
pathway) from the injury to “ouch” locations in the brain.
First, you need basic information about the route that pain pathways follow
in the nervous system. The nervous system is divided into two parts:

 The brain and spinal cord, also known as the central nervous system
(CNS), shown in Figure 2-1.
 All the nerves that go to and from the CNS, called the peripheral 
nervous system (PNS), also shown in Figure 2-1. Figure 2-2 shows a typi-
cal pain pathway.

Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

The PNS includes two types of neurons:
 Efferents send impulses away from the CNS. Some of the efferents go to
(innervate) muscles and are called motor neurons, and others innervate
visceral structures (autonomic neurons).
 Afferents send impulses to the CNS. They’re also called sensory nerves.
They affect and inform the CNS, telling your body what’s going on, both
inside and outside.
All neurons, including sensory neurons, are comprised of three parts:
 Cell body, which contains the nucleus of the cell and makes substances
that keep the cell alive and running.
 Dendritic tree, which includes extensions of the cell body in the CNS
that bring information in. Peripheral sensory neurons are unusual. Instead
of having dendrites, they have a long axon that brings information from
places, such as the skin, back to the cell body.
 Axons, which usually are located at the opposite end of the neuron from
the dendrites. They carry information away from the cell body (see
Figure 2-3.)
Cell bodies of sensory afferents are located near the spinal cord, forming a
cluster of cells called the dorsal root ganglion. A long axon brings information
from the skin or other tissues to the cell body, and a short axon enters the
spinal cord (refer to Figure 2-3).

Chapter 2: Discovering How Pain Works

Some of your sensory axons receive and carry the news that you’re hurt,
whether the injury occurred from a car crash, a stroke, or a bee sting.
Sensory nerve fibers send a pain alert to your spinal cord. Peripheral nerves
(part of the PNS) that contain the long axons of afferents also contains motor
axons (efferents) running from the spinal cord to your muscles. These motor
axons manage your responses, such as when you swat an annoying fly or run
away from a swarm of bees.
Peripheral nerves not only carry sensory and motor axons. They also are
home to efferent axons from the spinal cord to body structures, such as your
blood vessels or your stomach. These efferents are part of the autonomic
nervous system. We talk about the sympathetic division of the autonomic
nervous system because it produces stress reactions to pain.
Targeting the axons responsible 
for chronic pain
The peripheral endings of sensory nerves contain a variety of nerve endings
called receptors. They transform different kinds of energy, such as touch,
cold, or heat, into neural impulses (also called action potentials). These
impulses from receptors responsive to painful stimuli (called nociceptors)
carry messages to your pain pathways in the CNS.
The axons of sensory neurons differ by size and the degree of myelin on
them. (Myelin is a substance that covers and protects nerves.) The largest
axons are encased in a myelin sheath, which makes them big and fast. In fact,
their impulses can rush forward at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour, faster
than you can drive your car in a school zone. These fast and large axons are
called A-Beta fibers.
Small axons with some myelin respond to painful stimulation. They’re your
warning system for acute pain. For example, they’re fast enough to set off a
withdrawal reflex to make you snatch your hand back from a hot burner.
These axons are called A-Delta fibers.
The smallest axons, called C fibers, have no myelin, and they conduct infor-
mation very slowly (about 3 miles an hour). These axons are the most plenti-
ful, and they can reach any tissue. C fibers are responsible for the pain you
feel if something touches the cornea of your eye or you have a toothache.
Knowing this information, you probably aren’t surprised to discover that a
lot of chronic pain comes from activation of C fibers.
20
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

Electrically charged impulses
When a peripheral receptor responds to a stimulus, such as a pin prick, an
electrically charged impulse rushes right through the nerve, heading toward
the spinal cord. The impulse blasts through the nerve’s cell body and into 
the spinal cord.
Your central nervous system contains
 Your spinal cord: When a sensory impulse has passed through axons 
of your peripheral nervous system and reaches your spinal cord, it com-
municates with cells in the dorsal horn of the spinal gray matter. (Gray
matter of the CNS contains cell bodies of neurons.) The points of inter-
action between axons and cell bodies (or dendrites) are called synapses.
Many synapses live on each spinal cell. The electrical signal from each
sensory axon causes chemicals, called neurotransmitters, to be released
at the synapse. These neurotransmitters attach to receptors on cells in
the spinal cord, causing them to send messages along their axons. This
relay race goes from cell to cell to numerous destinations in the CNS,
depending upon which CNS pathway the axons travel in.
 Your brain: Some spinal cells receive information from the small par-
tially myelinated neurons, the A-Delta neurons, and also from very small
un-myelinated C sensory neurons sensitive to painful stimulation. These
pain sensitive afferents are called nociceptors. The spinal cells with
synapses from nociceptors send axons to the other side of the spinal
cord, where they turn toward the brain.
The next synapse for this pain pathway is in a part of the brain called the
thalamus, which has regions assigned to different sensory systems.
Sending pain messages to the brain
The main pain pathway from the spinal cord to the thalamus is called the
spinothalamic tract. (That’s a mouthful, and it takes plenty of neurons to help
you say it!) Cells in the thalamus that receive spinothalamic input then send
axons to the cerebral cortex.
The cerebral cortex tells you a lot about different aspects of pain you’re 
experiencing. For example:
 It gives you qualitative information. (Is it cold or hot on your skin, 
or are you experiencing a muscle cramp or stomachache?)
 It gives you quantitative information. (How painful is it?)
21
Chapter 2: Discovering How Pain Works

 It tells you where the pain is and how big an area it involves. (For 
example, your entire forehead hurts intensely.)
 It assesses how much the pain bothers you. (Your pain is tolerable, or it
makes you miserable.)
Responding to pain
A few more aspects of pain pathways can lead to chronic pain or effects of
chronic pain. Axons of the spinal cells that receive pain signals branch out
through the CNS where they perform different actions. Some actions are
important to understanding pain:
 Some branches go to the brain stem located between the spinal cord
and the brain (also called the cerebrum). Nuclei in the brain stem 
regulate sleep and wakefulness. Input to these regions arouses you and
can prevent you from sleeping. Loss of sleep can be a major problem 
for people with chronic pain.
 The brain stem is a major player in controlling your muscular tone and
coordinating reflexes that contribute to all your movements. For exam-
ple, the brain stem coordinates your withdrawal from a painful stimulus
in a way that prevents you from falling over. It also governs your reflexes
and can inhibit them; for example, it keeps withdrawal reflexes from
going off time and time again if the pain doesn’t stop. Unlike the alarm
on a timer, which doesn’t stop until someone turns it off, your brain is
smart and turns the withdrawal reflex off after awhile.
 The brain stem inhibits reflexes with axons in pathways that descend to
your spinal cord. There is some spillover of inhibition to spinothalamic
cells in the spinal cord. Therefore, some scientists think the brain stem
may play a role in regulating pain.
 Systems within the brain regulate stress reactions. One form of stress,
called psychological stress, activates both the hypothalamus and the
pituitary gland, which in turn leads to activation of the sympathetic 
nervous system. The result can be increased pain.
Producing Chronic Pain in the 
Peripheral Nervous System
When you stub a toe, maybe you curse and grab your hurt foot, while 
hopping up and down on the other foot. If you reflect on what you felt, 
you’ll find that you experienced two distinct pain sensations.
22
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

First, A-Delta fibers gave you immediate feedback that you hurt yourself once
again by stubbing your toe on that same table leg that hasn’t moved since the
last time you bumped into it. (Maybe now is a good time to move it!) The
input from these sensory nerves may even have been fast enough to help you
reduce the force that you applied to the poor toe.
Second, you likely felt a later pain sensation from C fibers that didn’t seem 
all that useful. The late C fiber pain is the one that causes you to curse the
table that hurt your toe. This delayed pain from an injury tells you about 
the severity of the injury and motivates you to do something about it. For
example, it keeps you from injuring the toe further by continuing to walk 
or run around while the pain is active.
Scientists have rigorously studied how injuries generate pain that persists
until healing is complete. This form of pain, known as acute pain, is under-
stood by most people as “par for the course” for minor injuries. How long 
the pain lasts depends on how much force was involved, whether or not you
broke your toe, and so on.
Chronic pain is a very different story. Even if an injury appears to have
healed, a variety of adaptations of the body to the injury can set in motion
changes that result in chronic pain. Some of these attempts of the body to
deal with injury can go wrong and are important for understanding why
chronic pain can develop.
Injury to your body sets in motion your immune system, which is your 
body’s defense system against disease and injury. In turn, your immune
system mobilizes inflammation. A staggering array of inflammatory cells are
released at and near the injury, and nociceptors (especially C fibers) are
uniquely able to respond to these chemicals. A slight stub of a toe protected
by a shoe yields a low level of inflammation that clears up quickly. A forceful
stub of a bare toe in the dark turns the toe lovely shades of purple and
causes swelling and sensitivity for a few days.
Here’s where things get interesting. It turns out that when C fibers respond 
to pain, they also turn on inflammation, which itself is another source of pain.
In other words, pain begets more pain. As long as you have inflammation, 
you have activity in nociceptors and vice versa. This process is the culprit
behind some types of chronic pain, which is like a stubbed toe with endless
inflammation.
The following sections describe some reasons why chronic pain can develop.
23
Chapter 2: Discovering How Pain Works

Chronic phantom pain from nerve injury
If an injury to a nerve completely interrupts the flow of information to the
nervous system, common sense says you should feel nothing in the area
where the damaged axons have peripheral terminals.
This thinking is true, but only to a point. If you stimulate skin in the damaged
area, you may have no sensation of touch, cold, heat, or pressure. However,
people who have lost their arms or legs report that phantom sensations
occur where the limb used to be. For example, after amputation of a limb,
most people feel or imagine that the limb is still present, sometimes in a 
distorted form. Then after some time, the phantom sensation actually can
become painful.
Paradoxically, the healing process itself may create pain. When peripheral
axons are damaged, the portion closest to the spinal cord is still connected
to its cell body, and it survives, but the part close to the skin that’s separated
from the cell body deteriorates (degenerates). Like a plant seeking the sun,
the axons attempt to grow toward their old target from the injury, and they
can ordinarily reach it, make new receptors, and reestablish nearly normal
sensations.
This process, called regeneration, works best when a nerve is crushed rather
than cut across, because the nerve’s coverings are preserved, providing
channels for growth. However, in the worst case, when the nerve is cut and
its normal target is gone, as in limb amputation, a tangle of regenerating
axons, called a neuroma, forms. Neuromas can create the sensation of pain.
Normally, axons in sensory nerves don’t conduct impulses unless their 
receptors are stimulated. Axons in nerves are insulated from one another,
and no synapses communicate between axons or cell bodies in the dorsal
root ganglion. In other words, they don’t usually talk. However, this system 
in a neuroma goes crazy, and two things happen:
 The ends of axons in the neuroma start acting wildly, which is called
spontaneous activity.
 The axons start talking to each other (even though, normally, they give
each other the silent treatment).
Sensations generated by spontaneously active nerves are felt at (referred to)
the sites where the terminals and receptors used to be (such as an ampu-
tated leg). This situation is because the brain is fooled into thinking that the
damaged axons are responding to the same stimuli that normally activated
them before the nerve was injured. The activity within a neuroma can even be
interpreted by the brain as feeling like the pain of the original injury that set
off this unfortunate series of events in the body.
24
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

Neuromas can form at the site of a nerve injury even if the nerve is not sev-
ered and the limb is not amputated. If this occurs, pain is felt in that nerve’s
innervation territory (where it’s peripheral receptors are). And — here is 
the really, really important thing to understand — activity within the pain
pathways produced by some abnormal source is what you’re usually dealing
with when you have chronic pain.
Adrenaline
Adrenaline is always present to some degree in your body. Adrenaline is 
usually a good thing because it mobilizes our resources to deal with danger-
ous and injurious situations. However, following a nerve injury, even if the
nerve is not severed, it becomes very sensitive to any release of adrenaline
(also known as epinephrine) in the surrounding area, which is the case for
axons that have been cut as well as those that are damaged but still in one
piece. This situation is called sympathetically maintained pain because
release of adrenaline normally occurs with activation of the sympathetic 
nervous system.
Nerve entrapment
If nerves are stretched or pinched continually, axons can be damaged and
can become spontaneously active. This condition is called nerve entrapment.
For example, sciatica is usually caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve from
osteoarthritis or disc protrusion in the lumbar spine.
Nerve entrapment is an example of how any condition that irritates a nerve
can cause chronic pain. Also, diabetes can lead to pain due to constant 
nerve trauma caused by the disease and made worse by inflammation.
Tracking Chronic Pain in the 
Central Nervous System
While the PNS is the communicator of sensory news, the CNS receives the
news and responds to it. Activity in the CNS in response to pain signals can
amplify and extend pain, causing two issues:
25
Chapter 2: Discovering How Pain Works

 Central reorganization: Unlike peripheral neurons, the axon of CNS 
neurons typically goes in one direction. For numerous reasons, central
axons don’t regenerate when severed, and the cell body can eventually
die. If an injury damages CNS axons that communicate between the
spinal cord and the thalamus, cells in the thalamus will no longer receive
normal messages. When central cells lose their normal inputs, they
become spontaneously active. As a result some people develop severe
chronic pain following injuries that cause damage to the spinothalamic
tract. Examples are spinal cord injury and post-stroke pain.
Here is the reason why cells become spontaneously active: Losing input
is traumatic for CNS neurons. For one thing, they suffer structural
damage caused by the loss of synapses that normally come from the
axons that are now damaged. Also, substances that normally nurture the
health of cells are lost. As a result, the cell that has lost its input (is 
deafferented) becomes sick. One good way to think of the spontaneous
activity of deafferented neurons is as cries for help!
Long tracks of axons in the CNS don’t renew themselves following an
injury. However, some reorganization of synaptic connections occurs 
for cells that lose their input. Therefore, when cells in the CNS have lost
their peripheral nerve supply, it’s likely that new inputs come to them
over time. If the output of the cell was interpreted as pain, any new input
also can trigger pain. Alternatively, the “right” inputs can get rid of the
spontaneous activity and alleviate pain. Therefore, reorganization
should probably be directed by training rather than left to chance.
 Central sensitization: Two types of inflammatory reactions in the 
central nervous system can contribute to chronic pain:
• When nociceptors are doing their thing, and particularly when
their activity is caused by a peripheral injury, support cells called
microglia are attracted to the region. Microglia are the immune
cells of the CNS, and they release inflammatory chemicals that 
sensitize spinal cells to overreact when pain messages come in
from sensory nerves.
• Another form of pain coming from inflammation is similar to nerve
entrapment or diabetic trauma to a peripheral nerve. (See the 
section “Nerve entrapment,” earlier in this chapter.) Axons in the
CNS are usually myelinated for fast conduction, even though the
cell body for these axons may receive input from unmyelinated
nociceptors. When the myelin of these axons deteriorates for 
any reason, microglia come in to clean up the damage, and the
axons become spontaneously active. Multiple sclerosis involving
demyelination of CNS axons can be associated with such pain.
26
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

 Glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter for nociceptors and therefore
for pain. The higher the alarm setting from the nociceptor, the more 
glutamate released in the spinal cord.
Copious amounts of glutamate may seem sufficient to feel pain, but the
spinal cord also has a built-in amplifier for input from the bad guys — 
C fibers. Unmyelinated nociceptors release a variety of transmitters. 
One of these transmitters, substance P, initiates a cascade of events that
increases pain if the discharge from C nociceptors persists over time.
(Remember Substance P by thinking “P” is for pain.) The amplification 
of pain by C nociceptors is called temporal summation.
Most chronic pain involves input from C fibers, plus temporal summation,
causing double trouble. So, when someone with chronic pain stubs a toe, the
pain is likely to be exaggerated. This exaggerated pain, called hyperalgesia,
usually lasts longer than normal pain because the sensitized cells in the CNS
continue to discharge after receiving input from the stubbed toe.
In addition to its role in initiating of temporal summation, substance P
spreads out readily from its site of release in the spinal cord to nearby 
neurons not receiving input from nociceptors at the moment. (“Hey guys,
we’re hurting!”) As a result, the areas surrounding a source of painful input
become hypersensitive to stimulation. This process is called secondary 
hyperalgesia.
With some pain conditions, a light touch or mild heat can produce severe
pain. A possible explanation is that some cells in the pain pathways are so
sensitized that even input from the usually blah A-beta afferents set them 
off. Painful responses to nonpainful input are called allodynia.

In This Chapter

 Acknowledging caregiver stress
U
ntil recently, all pain was viewed solely as a symptom of disease. 
The philosophy toward pain was, “Treat the health problem, and you
automatically treat the pain.” Today, experts report that chronic pain itself 
is often the villain that must be pursued and tackled. In fact, the medical 
term for chronic pain is maldynia, which means your pain has become its
own disease as a result of changes in the nervous system. Even though the
original cause of the pain is gone, the pain itself remains.
Unlike normal pain that can point to an untreated medical problem, in most
cases, chronic pain has no useful biological function. Not only is it without
purpose, but the condition often takes on its own puzzling life; for example, 
it may be constant or may come and go. It may be hellish on Monday and
more tolerable on Tuesday. It may move around, ending up far from its
source, which is sometimes known as referred pain.
Chronic pain may respond to medications one day, and then, the next day,
little relief comes from the same treatment that worked yesterday. Your 
frequent pain can lead to problems with relationships, lack of sleep, depres-
sion, and more. In this chapter, we cover common problems that may occur
with chronic pain and what you can do about them.
Assessing Different Types 
of Chronic Pain
Chronic pain is pain that recurs or persists for three months or longer or pain
related to an injury expected to either continue or worsen. Your body’s

response to injury, which may generate severe but temporary pain, may 
initially cause chronic pain. If these injuries don’t heal properly and the pain
generator (nociceptors) continues to be stimulated, changes can occur in
your nervous system.
These changes at the molecular level can be quite dramatic and may even
include genetic alterations. One of the most frustrating aspects of chronic
pain is that no known cause may exist. In fact, in the case of low back pain,
doctors can’t identify the cause in up to 85 percent of individuals — talk
about frustrating!
Chronic pain falls into different types of relentless hurting, which are
described in the following list. Unfortunately, you or a loved one may have
more than one type of chronic pain.
 Somatogenic pain is caused by physical diseases and disorders.
Somatogenic pain is divided into two different types of pain:
• Nociceptive pain occurs when pain-sensitive nerve endings called
nociceptors are activated or stimulated. (See Chapter 2 for more
information on nociception and nerve endings.) Most nociceptors
are located in the skin, joints, muscles, and the walls of internal
organs. Nociceptors are smart; they’re specialized to detect differ-
ent types of painful stimuli, such as heat, cold, pressure, toxic 
substances, sharp blows, or inflammation.
• Neuropathic pain is the result of damage to or malfunction of the
nervous system. It may involve the central nervous system or the
peripheral nervous system or both. (See Chapter 2 for descriptions
of the two types of nervous systems.) Neuropathic pain can occur
after a stroke or spinal cord injury or may be caused by diabetes.
 Psychogenic pain occurs when psychological and emotional factors
influence the intensity of the pain. You’re not imagining it, and the 
pain is real, but the explanation for the pain is a mystery. Examples of
chronic pain problems that are thought to be psychogenic are frequent
headaches, low back pain, atypical facial pain, and pelvic pain of
unknown origin.
 Somatoform disorders have some of the marks of real conditions, but
the condition doesn’t fully explain the individual’s symptoms. In other
words, these disorders completely baffle the doctors and the patient.
Examples of somataform disorders are body dysmorphic disorder (a 
preoccupation with a real or imagined flaw in appearance), conversion
disorder (neurological symptoms, such as paralysis, that aren’t caused
by a neurological disease), and hypochondriasis (obsessive worry about
having a serious illness).
30
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

Looking at Behavioral Cycles
You may describe your pain with phrases such as, “Today is a bad pain day,”
“Today is an okay day,” or “Today is a better day.” Chronic pain waxes and
wanes, and you may notice that as your pain intensifies, your mood goes
downhill. Alternatively, if you’re in an okay or a good mood, your pain may
not seem so bad.
For many people, chronic pain means that their day-to-day activities become
difficult (or impossible) to perform. This limitation can result in a negative
cycle in which the more pain you’re in, the more you limit yourself, which
also creates more pain.
Whatever type of chronic pain you have, it can lead to self-defeating behav-
ioral cycles that perpetuate more chronic pain. Just what you don’t want!
Figure 3-1 shows how the chronic pain behavioral cycle works. The cycle is
made up of the following five phases:
 Phase 1: Inactivity. In this phase, you’re in pain, so you limit what you’d
normally do. You cancel a trip to visit your mother because it means two
hours in a car, which will make you even more stiff and sore. You put 
off carrying the laundry downstairs to the laundry room, because just
thinking about it makes you tired. You don’t make dates to play tennis.
 Phase 2: Catching up. In phase 2, you feel okay. You may hop (well 
okay, you move into) the car and drive to visit your mother. You do the
laundry, making many trips up and down the stairs. You make a date to
play tennis. Life is good.
 Phase 3: Inactivity. In phase 3, the day after you’ve visited your mother,
done the laundry, and all your other catch-up activities, you wake up
stiff and sore. “Ouch! I did too much,” you say. You slow down. You
cancel that tennis date.
 Phase 4: Repeating the cycles. You may repeat this scenario many times
as you try to adjust to life with chronic pain. It becomes a vicious cycle:
You feel better. You do more. You feel worse. You slow down.
 Phase 5: Deconditioning. Phase 5 refers to the deconditioning that your
body suffers as you get out of shape in response to your pain. The time
you spend slowing down makes you tired and weak, which is an irony 
of chronic pain. You try to protect yourself through slowing down, but
this inactivity actually damages and weakens your body. Among other
things, it causes your muscles to weaken, which gives you less stamina
and makes you tired. See the sidebar “Avoiding deconditioning” for
some specifics.
31
Chapter 3: When Pain Becomes Chronic

A danger of the pain cycle is that you may spend more time alone. Your
tennis buddies don’t call anymore because you’ve cancelled one too many
games, and they’ve given up on you. Your family has gotten used to doing
things for you and without you. They think they’re helping out by filling in for
you and not forcing you to go. They don’t realize that the more helpless you
become, the more pain you’ll experience.
Managing Flare-Ups
Chronic pain worsens, and then it improves. This waxing and waning pattern
repeats, again and again. Flare-ups are those times when your chronic pain is
most intense. For example, on a 0-to-10 pain intensity scale, a flare-up may be
a time when your pain is a 7 or higher.
You’re most likely to use pain medications during chronic pain flare-ups.
While use of pain relievers can be the right thing, it’s important to have other
strategies in your anti-pain war chest. Don’t rely on drugs alone.
Flare-ups are often the result of pain triggers. Two major categories of pain
triggers reflect your physical and emotional states.
The first category includes activity or inactivity triggers, such as
 Staying in one position too long (such as sitting or standing for an
extended period of time)
 Repetitive movements performed frequently and for long periods of time
 Movements that strain your body (lifting or pulling a heavy object)
 Bad posture, such as slumping over, and stressing painful areas

The way to avoid these triggers is obvious: Do the opposite. For example,
make sure that you don’t stay in one position for too long. If your job
involves sitting for long periods of time, get up and move around frequently
to loosen up. If you’re slouched over, sit up straight.
Emotional triggers represent a second type of pain activator. It’s important 
to minimize or prevent unnecessary emotional stress and find better ways to
cope with it. (For more information, see Chapter 17.)
Another form of prevention involves heeding your own personal early warn-
ing signs. You may become aware of body sensations, such as migraine auras
or a sudden inability to move your neck, that give you advance notice of
flare-ups. Don’t ignore these signs! Instead, try the techniques we recommend
in Part III of this book.
Fighting Side Effects of Chronic Pain
You may be one of the lucky ones: You’re able to manage your pain and keep it
from taking over your life and the lives of your loved ones. But many people
who live with chronic pain run into some major trouble. They can become

Avoiding deconditioning
If you have chronic pain, you know how easy it
is to become a couch potato. Here are a few
consequences of deconditioning:
 Muscle deterioration (atrophy)
 Stiff joints
 Loss of calcium from bones (leading to
osteoporosis)
 Increased risk of heart disease and diabetes
 Loss of red blood cells
 Decrease in sex hormones and the produc-
tion of sperm
 Decreased resistance to infection (reduced
immune functions)
 Obesity
 Depression

sider a few advantages of becoming active:
 Increased joint flexibility
 Improved muscle tone
 Strong muscles
 Increased aerobic and cardiovascular 
fitness
 A desirable weight and fat ratio
 Release of endorphins (the feel good hor-
mones that counteract depression and pain).

physically and emotionally overwhelmed. They may drink too many cocktails
at night to “take the edge off” or run through all their painkilling drugs before
the prescription can be renewed. Their lives spiral out of balance.
Chronic pain often has serious side effects, such as weight changes, depres-
sion, and problems with stress and sleep. The following sections talk about
these major side effects and what you can do to fight them successfully.
Dealing with weight gain or loss
Obesity is a major problem in America, and 66 percent of adults in the United
States are either overweight or obese. Deconditioning is all too frequently a
consequence of chronic pain. (For more on deconditioning, see the section
“Looking at Behavioral Cycles,” earlier in this chapter.)
Not everyone overeats when they’re in pain. Some people eat much less 
and lose weight. Although weight loss sounds great to most people, losing
weight because you’ve stopped eating a healthy diet is not a good idea. Some
conditions that cause chronic pain, such as gastrointestinal problems, can
cause weight loss. Weight loss can be as dangerous as weight gain, but for 
different reasons. Underweight individuals may have poor physical stamina
and a weak immune system, leaving them open to infection. If you or a loved
one has unexplained weight loss, you need to see a physician for a medical
diagnosis.
Maintaining a healthy weight can help you prevent weight-related diseases,
such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and some cancers, all of which can
cause chronic pain.
Tackling depression and 
a negative self-image
Chronic pain can generate negative emotions, such as anger, frustration, and
fear. Probably the most common emotional result is depression, and at least
half of all people with chronic pain experience depression. People with
weight changes (see the preceding section) may also be depressed, because
eating more or less is a symptom of depression. Chronic pain may also cause
physical qualities that overlap with those of depression, such as moving
slowly, having trouble getting adequate rest, and feeling fatigue. A negative
self-image usually accompanies depression. But the good news is that these
problems are readily treatable.
If you or a loved one has symptoms of depression that linger for several
months and that stay the same or worsen, you may be in the throes of a 
serious depression.
34
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

The first step toward beating depression is to accept that you or your loved
one needs help. The good news is that depression can be treated.
Knowing when you need help
Are you unsure if you’re depressed? Here’s a list from the National Institute
on Mental Health of common signs of depression. If you have several signs
lasting more than two weeks, see your doctor.
 Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
 Feelings of hopelessness and pessimism
 Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and helplessness
 Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once
enjoyed, including sex
 Decreased energy, fatigue, and feeling slowed down
 Difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions
 Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
 Appetite and/or weight loss or overeating and weight gain
 Thoughts of death or suicide; suicide attempts
 Restlessness and irritability
 Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as
headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain
Fashioning a positive self-image
Your self-image is the sum of your opinions of yourself. Do you think you 
are smart, funny, and beautiful (or handsome)? If so, you’re unusual. Most
people are very critical of themselves. And, on top of that, the limitations
that accompany chronic pain can damage your self-image. So work on 
accentuating the positive aspects of yourself rather than fixating on what’s
wrong with you.
Your self-image directly affects how you feel about yourself and interact with
others. It also influences the way you react or respond to the stresses of life.
Learning to have a positive relationship with an imperfect body is key to
improving your self-image. And the better your self-image, the better you’ll
manage your pain.
Reinventing your view of you
Develop a healthier and more accurate view of yourself. A healthy self-image
starts with learning to accept and love yourself.
35
Chapter 3: When Pain Becomes Chronic

The following steps are recommended by the Cleveland Clinic to foster a 
positive self-image, with some of our own thoughts added:
 Take a realistic self-image inventory. Focus on the positives instead of
your weaknesses.
 Set realistic and measurable goals, such as losing a pound a week, rather
than fixating on the 20 pounds that you need to lose.
 Confront thinking distortions, such as “I can’t ever lose weight.” (See
Chapter 21 for more information.)
 Identify childhood labels. Did Johnny down the street laugh at your 
limp when you were a kid? Get over it.
 Stop comparing yourself to others. They have their weaknesses and
strengths, too. Try to improve from where you are now.
 Develop your strengths. And play down your weaknesses.
 Learn to love yourself. Trite but true: If you love yourself with all your
limitations, others will also.
 Give positive affirmations. Stop moaning and groaning or acting sick!
 Remember that you are unique.
 Learn to laugh and smile.
 Remember how far you have come. (And celebrate it.)
Reducing stress and getting some sleep
Stress and lack of sleep make chronic pain worse, although pain itself is a
powerful stressor. Yes, this merry-go-round is another vicious cycle associ-
ated with chronic pain. You need to break out of the cycle if you have one or
both problems. Imagine that you’re locked in a small, cold and gray cell, a 
cell of stress. Let yourself feel bad and sad. Then imagine yourself deciding 
to break out. You punch out of that cell, which now has the consistency of
cardboard. You’re free! This imagery may help you feel empowered.
De-stressing your life
Chronic pain is nerve-wracking. Your body automatically tries to fight pain.
Then, pain itself creates physical, emotional, and psychological tension. 
As if that wasn’t bad enough, physical tension increases your muscle tension
where it hurts.
Not fair, you say! We agree. And it’s a big reason why reducing stress is so
important for the person with chronic pain.
36
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

On top of that sorry state of affairs, your body systems, such as your central
nervous system, heart, and immune system, also react to tension. Your 
mind and emotions respond to the whole mess with increased worry, anger,
sadness, frustration, and so on. All these factors escalate your pain.
Another source of stress is the yucky consequences that chronic pain can
have on your life and the lives of your loved ones. For example, chronic 
pain can
 Impact your ability to work and, therefore, your financial security.
 Limit family activities and social life.
 Limit the fun things you do on your own and that give you satisfaction,
such as hobbies and recreational activities.
 Harm your self-esteem and feelings of self-worth.
For tips on overcoming stress, see Chapters 21 and 22. Among the things we
recommend are taking advantage of proven stress-reduction techniques, such
as meditation and self-hypnosis.
Solving sleep problems
Sleep problems are yet another vicious cycle: Pain causes sleep problems.
These sleep difficulties lead to increased sensitivity to pain, increased stress,
and so on. And this challenge can be worsened by other factors, such as
medications you take for pain, some of which can reduce sleep quality; how
much exercise you get; and your daily diet.
Lack of sleep makes pain worse and increases stress, yet it’s very difficult to
sleep when you have pain. If this cycle sounds like your situation, you’re not
alone. A Gallup poll found that 62 percent of people with chronic pain say
that they wake too early because of pain and are unable to fall back to sleep.
A variety of sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and waking
frequently during the night, are common for people who are hurting. If you or
a loved one has chronic pain, your sleep may also be less restful than it
would be otherwise.
Insomnia is the most common sleep problem. If you have insomnia, you have
trouble falling and staying asleep. Insomnia can last for days, months, or even
years. According to the National Institutes of Health, signs that you’re having
trouble sleeping include
 Taking a long time to fall asleep
 Waking up many times during the night
 Waking up early and being unable to fall back to sleep
 Waking up tired
37
Chapter 3: When Pain Becomes Chronic

Your chronic pain may be only one cause of your insomnia. Other problems,
such as worrying about your health or medical bills, can contribute to 
sleeplessness. And sometimes insomnia is a side effect of a medication or 
an illness.
Insomnia may become a bad habit. Develop new behaviors that will help you
get the good night’s sleep your body needs. See Chapter 20 for information
on how to develop these habits.
Maintaining balance
One of the costs of chronic pain is that it can throw your life out of balance.
Taking care of your pain condition may take up a lot of your time and energy,
which you have to factor in with all your other commitments, such as 
working, taking care of your family, or enjoying retirement.
After you face up to having a serious chronic pain condition, you may need 
to reassess your lifestyle. Take an honest look at what you do on most days.
How much time do you spend working, with your family or relaxing? Are you
able to devote time every day to exercise? Do you set aside time to take care
of yourself and your pain-causing condition? If not, you may need to rethink
your schedule.
Keeping Relationships on Track
Chronic pain impacts you physically and emotionally and also affects your
relationships with others. Your pain affects everyone you love, everyone 
who loves you, everyone whom you work with, and everyone whom you 
play with in some way, whether it’s because you have less time for them or
they’re upset by how the pain is obviously taking over your life. In most
cases, they want to help! Most families and other social structures, such as
work colleagues and friendship networks, experience significant stress when
chronic pain hits one of their members. The following sections address
issues you may encounter in your relationships, as well as ideas on how to
maintain good connections.
Dealing with relationship problems
Following are just some of the common relationship problems that can occur
for people who have a chronic pain condition:
38
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

 Withdrawal: Particularly during flare-ups, many people with chronic
pain would rather be by themselves and end up isolating themselves
from family and friends.
 A short fuse, taking out frustration and anger on those around you:
Anger and frustration about your pain are natural responses. But if you
take these emotions out on people you care about, it can cause serious
relationship conflicts.
 Trouble asking for and receiving help: One of the most difficult things
about being dependent is that it can be hard to ask for and receive help.
This situation is also problematic for the person who’s the helper. In
short, the dynamic between the giver and receiver of help sometimes
can be awkward and cause considerable stress in the relationship.
 Difficulty in sexual relationships: Some people with chronic pain
develop sexual problems. Medications, pain, and fatigue can all decrease
sex drive. Read Chapter 27 for ideas on how to enhance your sex life
when you have chronic pain.
Maintaining communication
One of the keys to resolving relationship conflicts is to give both time and
attention to problems when they crop up. Often visiting a trained therapist
can help. Here are some resources:
 The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy offers
guidance materials and links to locate qualified therapists in local areas.
Web site: http://www.aamft.org
 The American Psychological Association (APA) in Washington, D.C., 
is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psy-
chology in the United States. Its membership includes more than 150,000
clinicians and other professionals. Obtain a referral to a psychologist 
in your area by calling 1-800-964-2000. The operator will use your zip
code to locate and connect you with the referral service of the state 
psychological association. Web site: www.apa.org
 Members of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) help
people in their own environments by looking at different aspects of their
life and culture. Search for a clinical social worker near you by entering
your city, state, and/or zip code into NASW’s drop-down menu on its
Web site: www.helpstartshere.org/common/Search/search.asp

Chapter 3: When Pain Becomes Chronic

Acknowledging caregiver stress
What if you’re not the one in severe pain but instead you’re someone who
cares about that person? For lack of a better word, you’re the caregiver,
even if the main care giving is holding the ill person’s hand when she’s feeling
really bad. Sometimes the caregiver feels stressed, and it’s important to
acknowledge this fact.
Research suggests that the physical and emotional demands on caregivers
put them at greater risk for health problems. These facts are from the
National Institutes of Health:
 Caregivers are more at risk for infectious diseases, such as colds and flu,
and chronic diseases, such as heart problems, diabetes, and cancer.
 Depression is twice as common among caregivers compared to 
noncaregivers.
 Caregivers supply nearly 257 billion dollars a year in services for their
loved ones, such as transportation, supervision, financial management,
and so on.
Caregivers juggle many roles. Besides assisting a loved one, most are married
or living with a partner, have a paid job, and also care for a child or an elderly
person. If you’re a caregiver, you may go through the same cycles as your
loved one with chronic pain. Like them, you’re losing control over your daily
life: Maybe your wife is no longer the confidante she used to be because she’s
absorbed with her pain, and consequently, you feel lonely and sad. Maybe
your loved one is grumpy and takes it out on you, which can be very hard to
take. You’re trying to help, and your head gets bitten off! Even when you
know it’s the “pain” that is talking, it still hurts.
If you’re a caregiver, watch for signs that this role is stressing you out too
much. These common signs of caregiver stress are from the American
Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP):
 Feeling sad or moody
 Crying more often than you used to
 Having a low energy level
 Feeling like you have no time for yourself
 Having trouble sleeping, or not wanting to get out of bed in the morning
 Having trouble eating, or eating too much
 Seeing friends or relatives less often than you used to
40
Part I: Getting the Lowdown on Chronic Pain 

 Losing interest in your hobbies or the things you used to do with friends
or family
 Feeling angry at the person you are caring for or at other people or 
situations
In addition, you may get little or no thanks from the person you’re caring for,
which can add to your feelings of stress and frustration. Realize that these
feelings are perfectly natural. AAFP points out that some doctors regard 
caregivers as hidden patients because of the stress and strain on them. Talk
with your doctor about your feelings. Stay in touch with your friends and
family members. Ask them for help in giving care.
If you’re a caregiver but you don’t take care of yourself and stay well, you
won’t be able to help the people you love.
Many communities offer caregiver support groups that provide you an oppor-
tunity to share information and feel connected to others providing care, just
like you. Support groups are often organized through churches, synagogues,
recreation centers, and Area Agencies on Aging. Your local social services or
aging office can direct you to a support group.

can lead to chronic pain, as well as how these causes
are diagnosed and treated. We cover the most common
forms of arthritis, headaches, and cancer pain, to name
just a few.
Remember that just because you hurt all the time doesn’t
mean that you have one of these conditions! In fact, you
may have chronic pain and never know the cause. (How

t can sneak up and strike you suddenly and without warning. You were
okay yesterday, but today you’re hurting. Or it can overtake you in small,
increasingly painful steps — you noticed a sore knee a year ago, a painful
shoulder about six months ago, and soreness in your wrist a month ago.
None of them has gone away.
It’s arthritis, the leading cause of disability in the United States. Tragically,
arthritis can strike as early as infancy, although most people with arthritis
are middle-aged or older adults.
This chapter includes general information about arthritis and what you can
do about it. We cover the most frequently occurring form of arthritis,
osteoarthritis, along with nine other common types of the disease.
Sneaking Up on You: Arthritis
Most people think of arthritis as a disease that affects the joints (the intersec-
tion where two bones meet). But the term arthritis actually is a catchall term
for more than 100 medical conditions that affect not only your joints, but
your muscles and bones as well. In fact, some conditions, such as rheumatoid
arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, can attack the entire body.
According to the National Institutes of Health, common symptoms of arthritis
are pain and stiffness in your body, trouble moving around, and swelling in
your joints.

Treatments for arthritis vary according to the type. In other words, what
works for rheumatoid arthritis doesn’t work for gout. You can read about 
specific treatments in the upcoming sections on different types of arthritis.
General treatments are used by people with all arthritis types, such as 
popular painkillers to treat pain and inflammation. In addition, most doctors
recommend that overweight people lose weight. And everyone should 
exercise. (Read more about exercise in Chapter 19.)
The Most Frequent Form: Osteoarthritis
Linda, 35, says most of her osteoarthritis pain is in her knees, and it’s often
hard to walk. Diana, 55, says her arthritis is primarily in her back. As with
Linda, Diana has trouble walking, but her problem is severe back pain caused
by osteoarthritis. (Read more about back pain in Chapter 5.)
The hallmark of osteoarthritis (OA) is damage to one or more joints.
Osteoarthritis is the most commonly occurring form of arthritis. The 
troublemaker in the joint is the cartilage, which is a rubbery, fibrous, dense
connective tissue that cushions the joint. The cartilage — which usually 
protects joints from the wear and tear of daily walking and other activities, 
as well as general aging — breaks down (see Figure 4-1). The result is that 
the bones of the joint rub against each other, causing inflammation. As the
disease progresses, joints become painful, stiff, and limited in motion.
46
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
Facts about arthritis
The following facts are from the Arthritis
Foundation:
 Arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic
health problems and the nation’s leading
cause of disability among Americans over
age 15.
 Arthritis is second only to heart disease as a
cause of work disability.
 Arthritis limits everyday activities, such as
walking, dressing, and bathing, for more than
7 million Americans.
 Arthritis results in 39 million physician visits
and more than a half million hospitalizations.
 Arthritis costs the U.S. economy $128 billion
per year.
 Arthritis affects people in all age groups,
including nearly 300,000 children.
 Baby boomers are at prime risk for arthritis.
More than half those affected with arthritis
are under age 65.
 Half of all Americans with arthritis don’t think
anything can be done to help them. (They’re
wrong.)
 Arthritis strikes women more often than men.

Osteoarthritis is often thought of as an older person’s disease. And, indeed,
the line, “Live long enough, and you’ll get osteoarthritis” is mostly true.
However, younger people sometimes develop this form of arthritis, usually
due to sports injuries or accidents. For example, football players can develop
osteoarthritis in their knees, and tennis players can develop it in their shoul-
ders. (Many people mistakenly believe tennis elbow is caused by osteoarthri-
tis, but it’s actually due to an injury of the muscle and tendon area around
the outside of the elbow.)
What causes or triggers osteoarthritis is a mystery, but some risk factors are
known. According to the National Institutes of Health, key risk factors are
 A genetic defect in joint cartilage
 Being overweight
 Getting older
 Joint injury
 Joints that are not properly formed (such as hip dysplasia)
 Stresses on the joints from certain jobs and playing sports
If you have any of these symptoms, you may have osteoarthritis:
 A crunching feeling or the sound of bone rubbing on bone
 Stiffness in a joint after getting out of bed or sitting for a long time
 Swelling or tenderness in one or more joints
If these symptoms are interfering with your daily life, talk with your doctor
about them right away.

Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts

While medications for pain relief are usually necessary, the most important
treatment for osteoarthritis is a joint-friendly lifestyle. Eating a healthy diet,
maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding joint damage, and lessening the stress
in your life are all keys to managing osteoarthritis. (For information on these
topics, see Chapters 18, 19, and 21.)
Painful Joints and More: 
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is called a systemic disease because it not only
affects joints, but also muscles such as the lung and heart. It causes pain,
swelling, and stiffness, and these symptoms are usually worse in the morning.
RA is known as a symmetrical disease. If one knee has rheumatoid arthritis,
usually the other knee has it, too (although one knee may be worse than 
the other). RA can affect any joint in the body and often attacks more than
one joint. People with this disease often feel sick, and they’re tired. (They’re
also sick and tired of having rheumatoid arthritis!) Sometimes they have
chronic fevers.
If you develop RA, you may have it for only a few months, or for a year or
two. Or you may have times when the symptoms get worse (flares), and
times when they get better (remissions). Some people develop a severe form
of the disease that lasts for many years or a lifetime. This type of RA can
cause serious joint damage.
The damage that occurs with RA is different from damage caused by OA,
which is described in the preceding section. With RA, the synovial membrane
that surrounds the joint is inflamed and swollen, and infected cells move in
and attack both the vulnerable bone and cartilage (see Figure 4-2). The carti-
lage becomes thin, the joint space narrows, and the joint capsule is inflamed.
Anyone can develop rheumatoid arthritis, although women are more likely 
to suffer from it than men. RA often starts in middle age and is most common
in older people. But children and young adults can also have rheumatoid
arthritis (For more information on the various types of arthritis that children
may develop, see Chapter 23.)
Doctors don’t know exactly what causes RA, but they do know that with this
form of arthritis, the person’s immune system attacks its own body tissues.
Possible causes include
 Genes (passed from parent to child, but don’t blame Mom or Dad; if they
could’ve stopped this gene from getting to you, they would’ve!)
 Lifestyle factors, such as smoking and obesity
48
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Most people with rheumatoid arthritis take medicine on an ongoing basis 
to relieve pain, reduce swelling, and stop the disease from getting worse. 
In addition to pain relievers generally used by people with other types of
arthritis, other specific types of medications, such as disease modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), provide tremendous relief for people with
RA. These medications are often used alongside NSAIDs and/or prednisone 
to slow down joint destruction. Examples of DMARDs are methotrexate, 
azathioprine, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine.
The biological response modifier is another type of drug used to treat RA.
Medications in this category inhibit proteins called cytokines, which con-
tribute to inflammation. Examples of biological response modifiers include
etanercept (Enbrel), inflixamab (Remicade), and adalimunab (Humira).
Another drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis is anakinra (Kineret). This
medication blocks interleukin 1, a protein seen in excessive levels among
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Sick and Tired of Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a disease that causes muscle pain and tenderness. This 
condition has been not-so affectionately nicknamed fibro. The muscle pain
can be anywhere and is often characterized as whole-body. Specific places 
on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs — called tender points —
hurt when pressure is placed on them, and the presence of these tender
points is used as a diagnostic test. Figure 4-3 shows these tender points.

Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts

Often, sufferers of fibromyalgia have a previous history of some other
chronic pain condition, such as whiplash pain, temporomandibular pain,
rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, repetitive strain injury,
headache, back pain, and interstitial cystitis.
Fibro affects as many as 1 in 50 Americans, but women are much more likely
to have the disease than men. Also, women with a family member with
fibromyalgia are more likely to have this condition.
Because people with fibromyalgia frequently score high on psychological
tests of anxiety or depression, it may appear that anxiety or depression
caused the muscle pain. However, pain itself generates psychological dis-
tress. The bottom line is that stress is important for understanding and deal-
ing with fibro.
If you or a loved one has fibro, relaxation training is beneficial (see Chapter
22). Any technique that improves blood supply to muscles helps, such as
exercise (see Chapter 19). Exercise is difficult to sell to people with fibro,
because it hurts in the short term although it helps over the long haul.
Learning to pace the exercise and adjust the amount of exercise day to day
based on symptoms of fibro can be helpful. The relatively new drug Lyrica
has helped some people with fibromyalgia. Opiate narcotics aren’t very
useful for most patients with fibromyalgia.

Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Overlapping Conditions: Polymyalgia
Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and temporal arteritis often strike together.
Polymyalgia rheumatica is a form of arthritis that causes low-grade pain in the
large joints. When asked to describe their pain, people with PMR often point
to their entire hip or shoulder rather than to specific tender points. Stiffness
and muscle pain are common with the disease. Other symptoms include
fatigue, night sweating, lack of appetite, a slight fever, and depression. PMR
affects both sides of the body, and more than one area may be stricken.
51
Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts
Chronic stress and fibromyalgia
Chronic stress, whether it’s psychological stress
or stress stemming from a focal pain condition,
works through complex circuits in the brain to
activate the hypothalamus and the sympathetic
nervous system. The long name for the central
organizing centers of stress is the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This fight-or-flight
system mobilizes you in a short-term crisis.
When long-term stress and activation of the HPA
axis occurs, it has widespread effects that can
explain not only fibromyalgia, but also other
associated conditions. Chronic stress can
increase pain sensitivity anywhere in the 
body. Even pain from stimulation of the skin is
exaggerated for some fibro patients.
Both stress and pain interrupt sleep (see Chapter
2), and sleep deprivation is a significant problem
for people with fibro. Also, sleep loss is a major
stressor (see Chapter 20). Sleep deprivation and
stress together can cause impaired memory
(called fibro fog).
Sympathetic activation from chronic stress
reduces the blood supply to muscles (peripheral
vasoconstriction). Females are more susceptible
to this effect, contributing to the high incidence
of fibro among women. Many fibro patients have
Raynaud’s syndrome, with symptoms of reduced
peripheral blood supply (such as cold hands).
Long-term reduction of blood supply to the mus-
cles (ischemia) makes the pain receptors (noci-
ceptors) more sensitive to pressure, an important
characteristic of fibro. In addition, it sensitizes a
peripheral receptor responsible for muscular
fatigue. A condition called chronic fatigue syn-
drome (CFS) is commonly associated with fibro.
(CFS is a syndrome that involves debilitating
fatigue, which makes physical exercise or
mental activity very difficult.)
Input to the CNS from muscle nociceptors is a
very potent source of central sensitization (see
Chapter 2). This process is a vicious cycle: Any
focal pain condition can eventually produce
widespread muscular pain, which increases
central sensitivity to both the focal pain and the
widespread pain.

PMR has symptoms that can be confused with fibromyalgia (see preceding
section). However, fibro usually strikes women in their 30s and 40s, and PMR
is more common in older adults.
Temporal arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of your arteries. (Temporal
arteritis is also called giant cell arteritis.) The temporal arteries, which supply
blood to part of the head, are most often affected. The disease is potentially
very damaging and can lead to violent headaches and even blindness. PMR
and giant cell arteritis overlap in many cases.
White women over age 50 have the highest risk of developing the two 
conditions. While people with PMR may also develop giant cell arteritis, if
you’re over age 50, arteritis can strike even if you don’t have PMR.
Anti-inflammatory drugs and rest are used to treat PMR. Corticosteroids are
used to treat both diagnosed PMR and temporal arteritis. Without treatment,
these conditions can progress with devastating consequences, such as 
blindness and/or stroke.
TMJ Dysfunction: It’s All about Your Jaw
TMJ is an abbreviation for the temporomandibular joint, the technical term
for the joint between the lower jaw and the temporal bone of the skull (see
Figure 4-4).
TMJ results from your jaw not functioning properly, leading to tenderness,
pain, a clicking sound when you move your mouth, and/or locking of the jaw.
TMJ may cause headaches, earaches, and dizziness.
People who get TMJ usually have arthritis in the joint and/or clench (or
grind) their teeth, but the pain can come from the muscles used to chew and
close the mouth and doesn’t always involve the actual joint.
To treat TMJ, rest your jaw by eating soft foods, such as yogurt and apple-
sauce (which are very nutritious foods). Be sure you avoid clenching or
grinding your teeth and use ice packs when the condition really bothers you.
If you have symptoms of TMJ, talk them over with your dentist. He may 
suggest using a mouth guard or refer you to an otolaryngologist (head and
neck surgeon) or oral (dental) surgeon.

Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Sniffling Over Soft Tissue Diseases
Soft tissue syndromes affect the tissues surrounding joints, causing pain,
swelling, and inflammation. These syndromes can affect any area of your
body, such as your shoulder, elbow, or lower back.
Soft tissue syndromes have many names, depending on where they occur in
the body. One of the best-known syndromes of this type is myofascial pain
syndrome (MPS), a chronic pain problem that may involve a single muscle or
an entire muscle group. The pain may burn, stab, ache, or nag. The pain from
MPS may also be referred, which means that it does not occur at the source,
but travels to another place in your body.
Scientists aren’t sure what causes MPS. The most well-known theory is that a
muscle injury causes a painful tender point.
If any of these traits apply to you, you may be at risk for MPS:
 Abnormal bone or muscle structures
 Bad body posture
 Overuse or injury of a joint or muscle

MPS can also strike in association with other diseases or conditions, such as
fibromyalgia, described earlier in the chapter in the section “Sick and Tired of
Fibromyalgia.”
The primary treatment for MPS is to stop overusing the muscle or muscle
group that has been injured. Other treatment options are
 Massage therapy
 Physical therapy
 Stretch-and-spray therapy, which involves spraying the painful muscle
with a coolant and then stretching it
 Trigger point injections of pain-relieving drugs
Lupus: When Your Immune 
System Attacks You
With lupus, something goes wrong with your immune system and attacks
your healthy cells and tissues. The antibodies present in this process cause
inflammation and pain. They also damage many parts of the body, such as
the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain. Inflammation
is considered the primary feature of lupus.
For many people, lupus is a mild, but painful disease affecting only a few
organs. For others, it may cause serious problems and can even cause death.
Lupus comes in many different types. The most common type, systemic lupus
erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Other types of lupus are
 Discoid lupus erythematosus, which causes a skin rash that doesn’t 
go away
 Drug-induced lupus, which is caused by some medications such as 
procainamide (Pronestyl), and quinidine (Quinaglute), used to control
abnormal heart rates
 Neonatal lupus, a rare type of lupus that affects newborns
 Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which causes skin sores on
parts of the body exposed to sun
The Lupus Foundation of America (LFA) estimates that 1.5 to 2 million
Americans have a form of lupus. More than 90 percent of people with lupus
are women. Lupus usually strikes women in their childbearing years, between
ages 15 to 45 years. In the United States, lupus is more common in African-
Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans than Caucasians.
54
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Many people can do well when treated for lupus. If you have lupus, getting
plenty of rest and wearing sun block to protect against sun exposure are 
key measures to avoid flare-ups. For information on treatment and other 
concerns about lupus the following Web sites are great resources:
 Lupus Foundation: www.lupus.com
 Lupus Research Institute: www.lupusresearchinstitute.org
Too Dry for Too Long: Sjogren’s Syndrome
Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune arthritic disorder that causes severe
dryness in the mouth and eyes. It may also affect other organs in the body.
Sjogren’s comes in two types: primary and secondary. Primary Sjogren’s 
syndrome strikes by itself. People who develop secondary Sjogren’s have
another disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and they develop dry eyes and
mouth as a result of that disease. Secondary Sjogren’s is usually less severe
than primary Sjogren’s.
Most people who get Sjogren’s syndrome have passed age 40, and 9 out of 10
sufferers are women. Sjogren’s syndrome is sometimes linked to rheumatoid
arthritis, described in the section “Painful Joints and More: Rheumatoid
Arthritis,” earlier in this chapter.
According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Disease
(NIAMS), treatment for the dry eyes of Sjogren’s may include
 Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Lacriserts), a prescription drug that
wets the eye surface and keeps natural tears from drying out fast. It
comes in a small pellet placed in your lower eyelid. When you add eye
drops, the pellet melts and forms a film over your own tears, trapping
moisture.
 Artificial tears that come in different thicknesses and are available 
over-the-counter.
 Chewing gum or sucking on hard candy to help your glands make more
saliva. Sugar-free gum and candy are best. (But be careful about chewing
gum because it can cause TMJ!)
 Eye ointments, which are available over-the-counter, are thicker than
artificial tears. They protect the eyes and keep them wet for several
hours. They can blur vision, so you may want to use them while you
sleep.
 Sipping water or a sugar-free drink often to wet your mouth.
 Surgery to shut the tear ducts that drain tears from the eye.
55
Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts

In addition, your doctor may prescribe pilocarpine (Salagan) tablets to treat
dryness of the mouth and throat, Evoxac to treat a dry mouth, or
cyclosporine ophthalmic solution (Restasis) to treat dry eyes.
An important resource for people with Sjogrens is the Sjogren’s Syndrome
Web site at www.sjogrens.org.
Giving Up Gout
Gout, also known as metabolic arthritis, is a painful condition caused by 
crystals of uric acid that settle into tissues of the body. Uric acid is a break-
down product of purines (organic compounds), which are present in many
foods. Gout may be caused by an inherited abnormality in the body’s ability
to process uric acid.
Gout is known for its recurring, extremely painful attacks of joint inflamma-
tion (arthritis). Chronic gout can lead to deposits of hard lumps of uric acid
in and around the joints, as well as decreased kidney function and kidney
stones. Almost 20 percent of people who have gout develop kidney stones.
Gout is a menace for about 1 million people per year in the United States.
Nine out of ten gout victims are men. In women with gout, the onset usually
occurs after menopause. Certain characteristics are common in people who
develop gout, including
 Abnormal kidney function
 Abnormal metabolism of uric acid
 Excessive weight gain
 High blood pressure
 Moderate to heavy alcohol intake
 Obesity
If NSAIDs or corticosteroids don’t control gout symptoms, your doctor may
consider prescribing colchicine. This drug is most effective when taken
within the first 12 hours of an acute attack. For chronic gout attacks, your
doctor may prescribe allopurinol (Zyloprim) to treat high levels of uric acid
and reduce the frequency of sudden attacks. (See Chapter 14 for information
on NSAIDs and corticosteroids.)
If you have gout, avoid high-purine foods, such as sweetbreads, liver, meat
extracts such as Oxo or Bovril, herring, and scallops, which can increase uric
acid levels.

Bones Silently Turning to 
Powder: Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a common and painful condition that can disfigure and dis-
able its victims. It weakens bones and can cause spontaneous fractures. In
fact, in the advanced stage, doctors sometimes say that their patient’s bones
have “turned to powder.” The signature worst symptom of osteoporosis is
fractures, primarily of the spine, hips, and wrists. Many physical characteris-
tics commonly associated with aging — such as a stooped posture, shrinking
height, and thick waist — are actually caused by osteoporosis. So it’s not 
surprising that many people think of osteoporosis as a condition of older age.
Actually, however, osteoporosis begins in the early adult years, and steps to
thwart it should start then.
Osteoporosis is often called silent because bone loss occurs without 
symptoms. People may not know that they have osteoporosis until a sudden
strain, bump, or fall causes a bone to break.
Ten million people in the United States have osteoporosis. Millions more
have low bone mass, or osteopenia (not as bad as osteoporosis, but bad
enough), placing them at increased risk for more serious bone loss and 
subsequent fractures
These characteristics put people at high risk for osteoporosis:
 A family history of osteoporosis
 Decreased consumption of dairy products
 Endurance athlete, including running and dancing
 A medical condition such as inflammatory small bowel disease or 
celiac disease
 Taking a medication that blocks calcium absorption, such as a steroid
 Heavy cigarette smoker
 Heavy consumption of alcohol
 Older age
 Partially or totally immobilized
 Physically inactive
 Poor eating habits and/or an eating disorder
 Strenuous dieter and/or faster
57
Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts

Osteoporosis isn’t curable, but it is treatable. Two important preventive and
treatment measures are a diet adequate in calories, calcium, vitamin D, and
protein, and secondly, weight-bearing exercise. (See Chapters 18 and 19 for
information on diet and exercise.)
Medications and other substances can prevent and treat the bone-robbing
condition. They include
 Biophosphonates (Aredia and Zometa), which can increase bone density
and can help in preventing osteoporsosis caused by use of corticosteroids
 Calcitonin, which reduces the risk of bone fractures
 Estrogen supplement therapy
 Selective estrogen receptor modulators (Ralozifene), which also can
increase bone density
 Strontium ranelate (Protelos), popular in Europe, to treat osteoporosis
 Parathyroid hormone (Teriparatide), which can increase bone density
 Vitamin D and calcium, to help reach and keep maximum bone density
The National Osteoporosis Foundation’s Web site at www.nof.org is a 
valuable resource for people with osteoporosis.
Diagnosing Arthritis
Whichever form of arthritis you have, the diagnosis and treatment requires a
hands-on approach. Your doctor will examine your tender joints and muscles,
move them around, and ask you to describe your symptoms.
Your doctor may also order lab tests to help diagnose the cause of your pain
and other symptoms. Most lab tests are performed on your blood, which is
like a script that holds many clues to what’s going on throughout the body.
Other tests may require urine, joint fluid, or pieces of skin or muscle. Your
doctor will study your tests to confirm a diagnosis, monitor the progress of
your disease, determine whether a medication is working, or look at whether
any drugs you’re taking are causing any problems.
Doctors also use tests to see whether your disease is getting better, flaring,
or progressing. For example, tests called sed rates and C-reactive protein
tests can show whether inflammation is under control.
Many people with arthritis take pain-killing and disease-modifying drugs on
an ongoing basis. If this is the case for you, it’s important to have regular lab
tests to see whether the drugs are causing any problems. Some medication
side effects aren’t noticeable until they do significant damage to the liver or
kidneys, so it’s better to be safe than sorry.
58
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Keep in mind that lab tests don’t catch everything. You may have a disease,
such as RA, but the lab tests show nothing. For example, 15 to 20 percent of
people with RA never have a positive rheumatoid factor. And on the flip side,
lab tests may be positive for a disease that you show no signs of (and thank
goodness for that!). (See the sidebar “Specific tests for arthritis” for a
description of the test for rheumatoid factor.)
In addition, no lab tests are available for some forms of arthritis, such as OA.
(See the sidebar for tests for other types of arthritis.) Other tests, including
X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging, are used to diagnose such diseases
as well as to check on further deterioration.
Considering Surgery
Most people with arthritis never need joint surgery. But when other treat-
ment methods don’t lessen pain, or you have major difficulty moving and
using your joints, surgery may be necessary. (You can read more about
surgery in general in Chapter 16.)
59
Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts
Specific tests for arthritis
You may hear people with arthritis talk about
their sed rates or CRP levels. The following tests
help your doctor diagnose arthritis and show
how you’re doing.
 Antibodies to CCP: This test looks for an anti-
body called anticyclic citrullinated peptide,
which can diagnose rheumatoid arthritis.
The antibody is almost never present in
people who do not have RA.
 Antinuclear antibody (ANA): This sensitive
blood test can detect autoimmune diseases,
including SLE, STU polymyositis, sclero-
derma, Sjogren’s syndrome, and rheumatoid
arthritis.
 C-Reactive protein (CRP): CRP is a blood test
that identifies inflammation.
 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed
rate): This blood test looks for a marker of
inflammation. It measures how fast red blood
cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood.
 HLA tissue typing: This blood test can 
diagnose two less common types of arthri-
tis, ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter’s 
syndrome.
 Joint fluid tests: This test is for abnormali-
ties, such as uric acid crystals or infectious
agents, in joint (synovial) fluid.
 Rheumatoid factor (RF): This test for RA
looks at gamma globulin, a component of
blood.
 Skin biopsy: Some forms of arthritis involve
the skin. Biopsies of skin can tell the pres-
ence of lupus, psoriatic arthritis, and other
conditions.
 Uric acid: This test looks at the levels of uric
acid in the blood in order to diagnose gout.

Types of surgery for arthritis include
 Arthrodesis: Surgery to fuse a vertebrae or other joint.
 Arthroscopic surgery: A minimally invasive procedure in which a small
viewing instrument, an arthroscope, is used to look at the joint. It is 
usually an outpatient procedure used both for diagnosis and treatment.
 Injections: Rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons inject substances
such as glucocorticoids and hylauronic acid into painful joints in order
to provide pain relief.
 Joint replacement: A major surgery in which damaged joints are
removed and artificial joints are inserted in their place. Common 
examples are knee and hip replacements.
 Synovectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the lining of the joint
(synovium).
Focusing on Healthy Joints
You can act to protect your joints and even prevent some forms of arthritis,
such as OA, and lessen the damage from others, such as RA.
 Maintain your ideal body weight. The more you weigh, the more stress
you put on your joints, especially your hips, knees, back, and feet. (See
Chapter 18 for tips on eating a healthy diet.)

 Avoid pain triggers. Find out how to tell the difference between the 
pain of arthritis and pain from overusing or misusing a joint. If you can
identify an activity that stresses a joint, stop that movement as much 
as possible. See Chapter 17 for tips on avoiding pain triggers.
 Move each joint through its full range of motion at least once a day to
help you maintain freedom of motion in your joints. For tips on how to
take your joints through their range of motions, see Chapter 19.
 Exercise! Exercise protects joints by strengthening the muscles around
them. Strong muscles keep your joints from rubbing against one another,
which wears down cartilage (and hurts!).
61
Chapter 4: Arthritis and Its Cohorts
Use your body wisely
The way you carry your body largely affects
how much strain you place on your joints.
Proper body mechanics allow you to use your
body more efficiently and conserve your energy.
 Stand up straight. Mom was right! Good
posture protects joints in the neck, back,
hips, and knees.
 When sitting, the proper height for a work
surface is 2 inches below your bent elbow.
Make sure that you have good back and
foot support. Your forearms and upper legs
should be level with the floor.
 If you type at a keyboard for long periods
and your chair doesn’t have arms, consider
using wrist or forearm supports. An angled
work surface for reading and writing is
easier on your neck.
 When standing, the height of your work sur-
face should enable you to work comfortably
without stooping.
 Increase the height of your chair to
decrease stress on your hips and knees as
you get up and down.
 To pick up items from the floor, stoop by
bending your knees and hips. Or sit in a
chair and bend over.
 Carry heavy objects close to your chest,
supporting the weight on your forearms.
 Use your big joints. When lifting or carrying,
use your largest and strongest joints and
muscles to avoid injury and strain on your
smaller joints.
 Don’t try to do a job too big for you to
handle. Get another pair of hands to help.
 Don’t give your joints the chance to stiffen
up — keep moving. When writing or using
your hands, release your grip every 10 to 15
minutes. On long car trips, get out of the car,
stretch, and move around at least every
hour. While watching television, get up and
move around every half hour.
 Balance periods of rest and activity during
the day. Work at a steady, moderate pace
and avoid rushing. Rest before you become
fatigued or sore. Alternate light and moder-
ate activities throughout the day and take
periodic stretch breaks.

My Aching Back
In This Chapter
 Understanding back pain
 Accepting the mysteries of back pain
 Exploring treatment options
 Adapting to back pain
A
t least once in your life, you’ve probably winced with pain and moaned,
“Ouch, my sore back!” Back pain is so common that it’s the No. 2 reason
why people visit doctors. (Headaches beat out back pain for the No. 1 spot.)
Sore backs that are long-lasting are frustrating for many reasons. First is the
pain itself. It’s an intruder — and an unwelcome and constant companion.
Two other maddening characteristics of chronic back pain are that the cause
(or sometimes the causes, if more than one factor is involved) is often
unknown, and back pain can often severely limit activities at work, at home,
and at play.
Although an ongoing sore back is just no fun at all, it’s not all gloom and
doom either. Whether you know what caused your back pain or not, you can
use many effective treatments and techniques to lessen and manage your
pain, even if you can’t completely cure it. We cover many of these treatments
and techniques in this chapter and Parts III and IV in this book.
If you follow the guidelines in this book, you may need to be cautious about
lifting, twisting, and performing some other actions. But you likely can resume
many tasks that you love, such as playing ball with your children and joining
your buddies on the golf course. And you may even take up some new and
fun activities like yoga or Pilates, which are great for your back.
Identifying Who Gets Chronic Back Pain
Maybe you’re like Sandy, whose back really hurts nearly every day from her
chronic arthritis problem. Or you may be more like Jim, who somehow

twisted his back getting out of the car, and found the pain excruciating. The
doctor treated him for a pulled muscle, which helped for awhile, but every so
often, the pain comes back again. In Lori’s case, she woke up one day with
severe back pain and has no idea why she has it — and the reason for her
pain has her doctor stumped as well. Fortunately for Lori, proven treatments
can improve chronic back pain, even when the cause is unknown.
The back and spine are two of the strongest parts of the human body. Even
so, because of day-in-and-day-out wear and tear on the back, at some point in
life, nearly everyone has a sore back. But, what about back pain that never
altogether leaves? Studies show that one in five adults have chronic, low
back pain, which is the most common form.
Some people are more inclined to have back pain than others. Randy
Shelerud, M.D., director of the Spine Center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, says that people with the following traits are especially likely to
develop chronic back pain:
 Taller height: Studies demonstrate that people prone to back pain have
a greater standing height than people who are not.
 Overweight or obese: Additional weight puts stress and strain on the
spine and muscles.
 Smoking cigarettes: Smoking leads to degeneration of the discs of the
spine.
 Poor muscle strength and conditioning in the lower back: Weak mus-
cles are less able to support the spine.
 Age 45 to 64: The older you are, the more likely you are to have arthritis
in the spine or degenerative joint disease.
Looking at the Back’s Delicate Anatomy
To understand back pain and why it’s laid claim to your life, you need to
know a little bit about your spine and the other parts of your body that are
associated with it.
If you’re reading this chapter, you or someone close to you probably knows
the woes of back pain, and you probably want to skip right away to the part
about how to make it go away. However, we encourage you to at least scan
this section on anatomy. It’ll help you better understand how to manage your
sore back or will help you to help your loved one to understand what you’re
going through.
Your back is supported by your quite remarkable spine, which provides your
body with strength and flexibility and also surrounds and protects your
64
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

spinal cord and nerves. Your spine is a canal that runs down the length of
your back from your brain to your bottom. It’s made up of bones, ligaments,
tendons, large muscles, weight-bearing joints, and highly sensitive nerves.
(See Chapter 2 for more details on human anatomy.) The following sections
look at each part of the spine, shown in Figure 5-1.
Vertebrae
The bones in your spine are called vertebrae, and they are held together by
ligaments. The normal adult spine has 32 vertebrae, each stacked on top of
each other:
 Cervical vertebrae: These seven vertebrae in the neck area hold up
your neck.
 Thoracic vertebrae: These 12 vertebrae are located in the middle back
and extend forward as the ribs.
 Lumbar vertebrae: These five vertebrae, located in the lower back, are
the largest ones, and they carry most of your body’s weight. That’s why
so many people with back pain report pain in this area.

65
Chapter 5: My Aching Back

 Sacrum: These five vertebrae, located below the lumbar vertebrae, are
fused together as one section. They attach the spine to the pelvis.
 Tailbone: These three vertebrae, located at the very bottom of the
spine, are also fused.
Facet joints
The joints between adjacent vertebrae are called facet joints. The facets are
bony knobs that meet between each vertebra. They link the vertebrae
together and make it possible for them to move against each other. The facet
joints give the spine its flexibility.
Spinal cord
Your spinal cord is comprised of cells and nerve-like pathways or tracts that
run from the bottom of your brain stem all the way down to your lower back.
Part of the central nervous system, the spinal cord is protected by the verte-
bral column, which is formed by the vertebrae.
Discs
Between each vertebra are discs that cushion them and serve as spacers.
They safeguard the openings where the nerves exit the spinal cord.
Muscles, tendons, and ligaments
The muscles running up and down your back play an important role in sup-
porting your spine so that you don’t collapse like a jellyfish. When these mus-
cles are strong (in other words, when you’re “physically fit”), they support
and protect your spine and help you move around with ease. But if these mus-
cles become weak (through lack of exercise, aging, or other reasons), then
your spine is more vulnerable to injury, and your mobility is also more limited.
The muscles in your stomach area and trunk also help support your spine
and give it good mobility. In addition, tendons connect your muscles to your
bones, and ligaments join your vertebrae together.
66
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Describing Chronic Back Pain
Chronic back pain ranges from a general vague soreness to a recurring sharp
severe pain, with all variations of pain in between. Stiffness is a common com-
plaint of back sufferers, especially in the morning. For many people, the pain
is located in the lower back (lumbar region). Although the pain is undeniably
a problem, often the biggest concern with backaches is the havoc they can
play with your everyday life.
For example, is it difficult to perform your everyday activities, such as gro-
cery shopping or walking your dog? Do you have trouble moving around at
work? Is it uncomfortable to sit at a computer for long periods of time?
Chronic back pain commonly hits (and stays with you) in one of two ways:
 Constant: It’s present for more than three months.
 Recurring: The pain stays for long periods of time. Then it leaves
(hooray!), but later it comes back yet again. This maddening pattern
continues, for months or longer.
Chronic back pain may get worse when you move your back, sit down, or lift
something weighing more than 10 or 20 pounds. The pain often improves
when you “take a load off,” meaning that you reduce the amount of weight
that your spine has to support. Often, doing something simple, such as get-
ting off your feet or putting down a heavy bag, can help. (And if you’re a
woman carrying a purse, clean it out at least once a week! Those loose coins
can add unneeded pounds to your burden.)
Is it hard to carry your bags through airports? Maybe you’ve even given up
flying because you don’t want to make your back problem worse by carrying
around heavy bags. Get suitcases with wheels that you can move much more
easily than the bags you must lug around.
Taking a Look at the 
Causes of Back Pain
The bad news is that, for the vast majority of people, the cause of back pain
is and will remain a mystery. In fact, only 15 percent of people with back pain
have a diagnosis that specifically explains the cause. Knowing this fact can be
discouraging. Simply put, if you and your doctor don’t know what’s causing
your back pain, how do you go about treating it?
67
Chapter 5: My Aching Back

Fortunately, doctors use proven treatments and activities that can help
lessen back pain even when the cause of your pain is unknown. (That’s the
good news.) We discuss these issues in the “Diagnosing and Treating Your
Chronic Back Pain” section, later in this chapter. The following sections look
at some common causes of back pain.
Behaviors
You can’t control your gender or your age. (As mentioned in the section
“Identifying Who Gets Chronic Back Pain,” earlier in this chapter, middle-aged
and older people have a greater risk for back pain than men or younger people.)
But you can control some factors, such as smoking, being overweight, and not
being fit. These causes are so important that we include them in the following
list of behaviors that can cause chronic back pain. According to the Mayo Clinic:
 Positioning yourself awkwardly, such as twisting around too far
 Not stretching or not stretching correctly, both before and after exercising
 Attempting to lift heavy items or lifting them improperly (such as using
your back, instead of your legs, to lift the weight)
 Carrying around heavy objects, such as computer cases
 Performing numerous repetitive motions, such as lifting and bending,
which strain your back muscles
 Standing or sitting with poor posture
 Being overweight
 Having poor “core” muscle strength (The core consists of the abdominal,
lower back, and pelvic muscles around your trunk.)
 Being overweight and not exercising regularly
 Smoking
Lifestyle factors
Some common causes of back pain may not be within your control — especially
if they’re tied to your livelihood:
 Demanding physical work, such as construction
 Repetitive heavy lifting
 Repetitive work of other kinds that includes a lot of bending or twisting
 Staying in one position for a very long time, such as sitting at a computer
screen for hours and hours
68
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Sometimes your job induces back pain. Maybe you don’t want to quit your
job, so what can you do instead? If you have to sit for long periods at the
computer, be sure to take regular breaks, at least a few minutes every hour.
Stand up, stretch, and shake out your body. Okay, you may look funny. But
you may also find that you’ve started a new trend at work!
Common health conditions
When a doctor can diagnose the source of back pain, the cause is usually one
of the following conditions:
 Muscle spasms: A strain or sprain can cause your back muscles to
shrink and the blood flow to decrease, both of which cause pain. Fibrous
connective tissue (fibrosis) may grow in the muscle.
Injured muscles may also spasm or knot up to keep you from using that
part of your body while it heals. Often the pain doesn’t strike right away,
but instead it lurks in the background and then sneaks up on you later
and pounces, long after you’ve forgotten what may have caused it.
 Osteoarthritis: Sometimes back pain is caused by osteoarthritis (OA) of
the spine (see Chapter 4). This condition is often called spondylosis. OA
causes the discs between the vertebrae to collapse. Without the discs to
cushion the space between the vertebrae, the joints (facets) abrade
against each other, which can cause pain and stiffness.
Ironically, your body may try to make up for the collapse of the discs by
creating new bone (called bone spurs), which can pinch your nerves and
cause significant pain.
Being significantly overweight increases the chance of getting OA in the
spine, so try to keep your pounds down to a reasonable level.
 Osteoporosis: As you age (especially if you’re a woman), your bones are
more likely to lose calcium, causing them to fracture easily. This condi-
tion is known as osteoporosis. If you have osteoporosis, even routine
activities like grocery shopping and cleaning can cause low back pain.
And a fall can lead to a very painful broken back or hip. Medications for
osteoporosis can help, as well as a routine level of caution. (For more
information on osteoporososis, see Chapter 4.)
 Herniated discs: Sometimes the discs in your spine come apart and
stick out of the spine. This condition is called a herniated, ruptured, or
slipped disc. If the disc pinches one of the nerves coming out of the
spinal cord, it can cause a great deal of pain. The sciatic nerve, which
runs from your spinal cord to your leg, is most commonly affected by
herniation. This condition is called sciatica.
69
Chapter 5: My Aching Back

 Spinal stenosis: Over time, the spine may narrow, a condition called
spinal stenosis. The narrowing can put pressure on the spinal cord and/or
nerves. In general, spinal stenosis can cause cramping, pain, or numbness
in your legs, back, neck, shoulders, or arms. It may also cause loss of
sensation in your extremities and sometimes causes problems with bladder
or bowel function.
 Spondylolisthesis: If one of the vertebrae moves out of place and
touches the bone below it, the resulting condition is called spondylolis-
thesis. The slipped bone, usually in the lower back or neck, can pinch a
nerve and cause pain.
 Degenerative disc disease: Sometimes the spinal discs lose their essen-
tial internal moisture that acts like fluid in a shock absorber. Once the
fluid is gone from the middle of the disc, the external disc starts to
buckle from the weight formerly carried by the middle of the disc. The
disc begins to bulge, and then it cracks.
Diagnosing and Treating 
Your Chronic Back Pain
The first step toward diagnosing what’s going on with your back is to find the
right doctor to help you. (See Chapter 13 for more information on selecting a
good doctor.)
To find out what’s going on with your spine, your doctor may order tests,
such as X-rays, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a computerized
tomography (CT) scan, or a discogram, which is a special X-ray examination
that involves injecting dye into the affected disc. These tests can help you
and your doctor establish a diagnosis, and decide on a treatment plan.
When developing a treatment plan for chronic back pain, having realistic
expectations is extremely important. The hard truth is that chronic back pain
usually doesn’t go away forever. However, you can do many things to lessen
and manage your back pain. Your goal should be to get to a point where you
can function and have a normal or close-to-normal quality of life, despite
your sore back. We cover some major actions that you can take to achieve
that goal in the following sections.
Hurry up and wait
A common approach to both acute and chronic back pain is “watchful wait-
ing.” We know, we know. You want to feel better now — even if that means
having less pain instead of being completely pain-free. Who could blame you?
70
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

But the truth is that often it takes awhile, sometimes a long while, for sore
backs to heal to a more tolerable level of pain.
Waiting doesn’t mean that you try to pretend your pain isn’t there and that
you basically do nothing. Instead, it means that you wait and watch to see
whether taking over-the-counter painkillers, stretching, and protecting your
back from further injury lessens the hurting and stiffness enough so that you
can enjoy life without resorting to taking heavy-duty prescribed drugs and/or
having surgery.
Most people don’t realize it, but when back pain is severe, a short period of
bed rest is okay. However, more than a couple of days of down time actually
does more harm than good.
Judicious exercise and stretching
Exercise therapy is really the best choice that you can make to strengthen and
heal the muscles and other tissues surrounding your spine so that they can
better support your back, give it the flexibility you need, and prevent future pain.
We emphasize the word therapy in the term exercise therapy. In this sense,
therapy means performing exercises specifically designed to strengthen and
improve sore backs. The exercises should be supervised by physical thera-
pists or other professionals who’ll ensure that you’re doing them correctly
and that you’re not injuring yourself by doing too much or performing the
exercises the wrong/painful-inducing way. 
Hot and cold therapy
Heat and cold can soothe sore backs and help reduce inflammation. If you
injure or irritate an already sore back, as soon as possible, apply a cold pack
for up to 20 minutes at a time. (You don’t need anything fancy. Put the ice in a
plastic bag and then wrap the bag in a cloth or towel to keep a thin barrier
between the ice and your skin.) Continue applying ice as long as you have
pain spasms.
When things settle down, switch to using heat from a heating pad, hot towels,
or a heat lamp. The heat from the pad, towels, or lamp helps loosen up your
tight muscles.
Don’t use a heat application longer than 20 minutes.
71
Chapter 5: My Aching Back

Support braces or belts
You may want to consider using a brace or back belt to support your spine,
particularly when you’re lifting anything especially heavy. And some people
with fragile spines — particularly those with advanced osteoporosis (see
Chapter 4) — must wear them to prevent injury. If you’re not in the latter 
category, but are considering wearing a brace or belt to reduce pain, be sure
to discuss this option with your doctor first and be cautious about using
these supports too often or too long. Research studies are inconclusive about
whether braces or belts reduce pain and stiffness, and they can cause your
muscles to weaken.
If you do decide to use a brace or back belt, they are available without a pre-
scription at pharmacies and medical-supply stores. In some cases, your
doctor may write a prescription to have a device specially made to fit your
particular circumstances.
Medications
Medications for chronic back pain range from taking over-the-counter painkilling
drugs (a common strategy) to taking narcotics, which should be used only when
absolutely necessary and for limited periods of time. Always try nonprescription
pain killers first. (See Chapter 14 for an overview of these drugs.)
Surgical procedures
Most people don’t need surgery for back pain. However, when your back pain
has a known cause and all other approaches have been exhausted, surgery can
provide welcome relief. (Read more about surgery in general in Chapter 16.)
Here are the major types of surgeries for back pain:
 Laminectomy and laminotomy: With these procedures, part of the
vertebrae are removed.
 Fusion: Two vertebrae are welded together. This surgery has a long
recovery time, but it’s used for many patients with back pain.
 Disc replacement: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
this therapy of removing the old disc and replacing it with an artificial
disc in late 2004. It’s still unknown how effective it is.
72
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

If you need back surgery, find out whether your surgery can be performed in
a minimally invasive manner. Using a laparoscopic surgical technique, the
surgeon reaches your spine from the front rather than through the back. This
technique avoids the need for long incisions, and the spinal nerves and cord
do not have to be set aside to remove a disc. Therefore, there is less risk of
pain caused by the surgery, and the recovery should be faster.
Complementary and alternative therapies
We cover complementary and alternative therapies for chronic pain in
Chapters 14 and 15. Many therapies we describe in these chapters are great for
managing chronic back pain. They include the techniques that physical thera-
pists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, fitness instructors, and
massage therapists — all people interested in improving back pain — use effec-
tively. Other important approaches to look over in Chapter 15 are acupuncture,
biofeedback, and chiropractic care.

Just before one of Mona’s horrible migraines strikes her, she gets fuzzy in the
head and can’t think straight. Sometimes she sees weird jagged patterns,
which means that a really bad headache is on its way. Tim, on the other hand,
has severe cluster headaches that cause his eyes to water like crazy and give
him excruciating pain for about 45 minutes each time — then it’s over. Sandy
has frequent tension headaches, and when they hit, she feels like some evil
genie has placed an invisible rubber band around her head and is steadily and
maddeningly tightening it, probably laughing like crazy the whole time.
Maybe you can relate to the headache problems of Mona, Tim, or Sandy.
Headaches are one of the most common chronic pain conditions, and 45 million
Americans suffer from chronic headaches, according to statistics from the
American Chronic Pain Association. Seven in 10 people have at least one
headache a year.
All headaches are caused by the activity of pain fibers that innervate blood
vessels within the brain, its fibrous covering (called the dura), or muscles
that support the head. The good news is that often people can learn to iden-
tify their own headache triggers and work to avoid the things that set them
off, whether it’s a type of food, severe stress, or another trigger. And if you
can’t avoid a trigger, at least you can have your medication or treatment at
the ready.

76
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
Distinguishing Between Primary 
and Secondary Headaches
Experts define headaches as either primary or secondary headaches. Primary
headaches, such as migraine and tension headaches, aren’t caused by other
diseases, but happen on their own. Genetics is thought to play a role in pri-
mary headaches, particularly in the case of migraines and tension
headaches. In contrast, secondary headaches are caused by diseases or
injuries. Examples are headaches that are caused by tumors or an infection.
Both types can hurt a lot, and sometimes a secondary headache hurts more
than a primary one.
If you suffer from frequent headaches, here’s a little self-test to help you
determine whether you’re suffering from a primary or secondary headache.
When a headache attacks, ask yourself this question: “Are the symptoms of
this headache different from the headaches I usually get? Or, is this headache
just like those I usually get?” Ongoing (old) headaches tend to be primary.
New headaches or those with different symptoms tend to be secondary
headaches. (This little test is only a generalization and not a hard and fast
rule. For example, you may have never had migraines, and sometimes they
suddenly appear in your life.)
Resources for people with chronic headaches
The Internet offers helpful resources for people
with chronic headaches. Check out the following
Web sites:
American Headache Society (AHS) Committee for
Headache Education (ACHE): ACHE is sponsored
and directed by the American Headache Society,
a professional society of health-care providers
dedicated to the study and treatment of headache
and face pain. Educational information on
headache topics such as migraine, headache
treatments, diary cards, nonpharmacological man-
agement, and trigger avoidance are available on
this site (www.achenet.org).
National Headache Foundation: NHF is an infor-
mation resource for headaches sufferers, their
families, and the health-care providers who treat
them. You can contact NHR at 1-888-NHF-5552 or
visit its Web site at www.headaches.
org.
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke (NINDS): NINDS conducts and supports
research on brain and nervous system disorders,
including headaches. Its Web site (www.
ninds.nih.gov/about_ninds/ninds_
overview.htm) provides information on
numerous clinical trials in headache research.

If you’re having symptoms that point to a secondary headache, don’t write
them off as “just another headache.” Secondary doesn’t mean “not important.”
The thing is, primary headaches are almost never life-threatening — they can
be stunningly painful and make your life miserable — but they’re rarely medical
emergencies. In contrast, serious illnesses, such as brain tumors or meningitis,
can cause secondary headaches, so you need to attend to them.
Avoiding Tension Headaches
Most headaches are tension headaches, which are headaches caused by
tensed muscles in the shoulders and/or the neck. If you suffer from tension
headaches, you probably experience two or three of them a month. But you
may be among the unfortunate few who have headaches two weeks out of
every four, or even more often. Ouch! Tension headaches usually appear
gradually, and they can last from hours to days.
Many people can’t concentrate when they have a tension headache because
of the very distracting pain. Tension headaches (see Figure 6-1) are often
accompanied by strain in the muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders. Many
people compare the pain of a tension headache to a vise squeezing their
heads. The pain usually occurs on both sides of the head, and it’s a constant,
dull pain. Most tension headaches strike during the daytime and worsen over
the day’s events. You rarely wake up with a tension headache.
Tension headaches can be triggered or worsened by stress, tiredness, loud
noise, and/or bright light or glare. Other triggers are eyestrain, temporo-
mandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ) (see Chapter 4), and neck pain, covered
in the section called “Paying Attention to Neck Pain,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 6: Head Cases: Migraines and Other Types of Craniofacial Pain

Diagnosing tension headaches
The International Headache Society (IHS) has developed standards, which
are widely accepted around the world, for diagnosing tension headaches.
According to the IHS, tension headaches last from 30 minutes to seven days
and are accompanied by at least two of the following criteria:
 A pressing/tightening, as opposed to a throbbing or pulsating quality
 Mild or moderate intensity (which may interfere with, but doesn’t prevent,
activity)
 A headache that occurs on both sides of the head
 The head pain isn’t aggravated by walking, climbing stairs, or similar
routine physical activity
You usually don’t have nausea and vomiting with a tension headache
(although you may lose your appetite).
Treating tension headaches
Tension headaches are usually treated with pain relievers such as aspirin and
acetaminophen. Research by the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago has
found that 200 mg of caffeine helps some people once a headache is trig-
gered. (Although caffeine is usually bad for you, it occasionally can help you.)
If these measures don’t work, your doctor may recommend trying specific
medicines used for migraines. (We cover these medicines in the next section,
“Managing Migraine Headaches.”) In addition, some doctors recommend tri-
cyclic antidepressants, a type of medication that — although referred to as
an antidepressant — has a variety of medical uses such as treatment of neu-
ropathic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and headaches.
78
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
Watch out for caffeinated drinks
If you drink a lot of soda with caffeine or you’re a
heavy consumer of coffee or tea, you need to
know that heavy doses of caffeine may be the
cause of your chronic headaches. A study in
Cephalgia (a headache journal for professionals)
in 2003 reported that after children who drank a
lot of soda every day were tapered off caffeine,
all but 3 of the 36 participants experienced a 
complete remission of their severe chronic
headaches. You’re not a child, but maybe caffeine
is the unknown villain in your chronic headache
problem.
Don’t stop drinking all sodas immediately, but
instead taper off slowly and substitute water.
Hopefully, your headaches will be much fewer —
or even gone altogether!

Many people with tension headaches find that when they get adequate rest
and sleep their headaches occur less often and are less intense. You can read
about techniques to help you sleep well and tackle fatigue in Chapter 20.
Injections of Botulinum toxin type A (Botox), a neurotoxin that blocks the abil-
ity of nerves to make muscles contract, helps some people. (Yes, it’s the
same Botox that’s used by people who want to eradicate their facial wrinkles.
Maybe you can have a smooth forehead and fewer migraines!) Botox actually
eases tension headache pain for some people. But eventually, without further
treatments, the headaches (and the wrinkles) come back.
Treating tension headaches with medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) and caffeine on an ongoing basis can
actually cause more headaches or make the headaches that you have get
even worse. This condition is called rebound headache or daily headache
syndrome. The treatment for rebound headaches is to steadily taper off all
headache medications. Limiting how much medicine you take is key to
preventing rebound headaches.
Managing Migraine Headaches
Migraines are so much more than just a headache. Yes, they involve head
pain, usually on one side. But the pain can be brutal, and it’s often accompa-
nied by nausea, vomiting, and very high sensitivity to light and noise. Often
these symptoms are extremely severe.
The typical migraine appears on one side of the head and generates a throbbing
pain (refer to Figure 6-1). Migraines usually build up gradually and may last from
several hours to (gasp!) a couple of days. However, sometimes they strike
suddenly, and they’re agonizing from the starting point.
A headache may not follow the classic migraine pattern, but it may still be a
migraine headache. For some people, migraines encompass both sides of the
head and cause a dull pain rather than a throbbing pain. Fortunately, such
nontypical migraines usually respond to treatments for migraines.
Triggers for migraines include foods or drinks such as chocolate and certain
wines, stress, the environment, odors/perfumes, emotions, medications, and
hormonal fluctuations. Ironically, relaxation after stress can trigger this type
of headache.
Some sufferers know when a migraine is about to strike because it is preceded
by a sensory distortion called an aura, which includes visual disturbances
such as flashing lights, zig-zag lines, or disturbed vision.
79
Chapter 6: Head Cases: Migraines and Other Types of Craniofacial Pain

Migraine headaches are three times more common in women than in men,
and some women experience migraines just before or during their periods.
They may finally receive some relief from migraines during pregnancy, only to
be slammed again with migraines soon after Junior is born, when their men-
strual cycle resumes. Migraines often begin during the teenage years.
Diagnosing migraine headaches
IHS developed the standard for diagnosing migraines and migraines with and
without auras. If the symptoms of either type are painfully familiar to you, be
sure to discuss them with your primary care physician.
In general, chronic migraines without aura last 4 to 72 hours and have at least
two of the four following characteristics:
 It’s located on one side of the head
 It has a throbbing quality
 The pain is moderate or severe, to the point that it inhibits or prohibits
daily activities
 The pain is aggravated by using the stairs or doing routine physical activity
 During the headache, at least one of the two following symptoms occur:
an acute sensitivity to light, sound, nausea, and/or vomiting
80
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
Rare migraines
Some people suffer from rare forms of migraines:
 Basilar artery migraine, which may cause
combinations of temporary blindness or
visual disturbances, dizziness, an inability to
talk, a loss of balance, ringing in the ears,
tingling and/or numbing in the arms and
legs, disequilibrium, a temporary loss of
consciousness, or confusion. These symp-
toms, in turn, are followed by a throbbing
headache, usually in the back of the head,
which may be accompanied by nausea and
vomiting.
 Ophthalmoplegic migraine, pain around the
eye, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and
double vision.
 Abdominal migraine,which affects children of
families with a history of migraine. The child
has stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. They
frequently have migraine headaches as adults.

A migraine with aura is experienced by people who’ve had at least two
headaches with a minimum of three of the following signs:
 Visual disturbances.
 An inability to speak.
 At least one aura symptom that develops gradually over more than four
minutes or two or more symptoms that occur in succession.
 No aura symptom that lasts more than 60 minutes.
 The migraine follows the aura. (It may also simultaneously begin with the
aura.) The advantage of the aura and the delayed headache is that it gives
you warning time to take your medication and stave off the worst pain.
Treating migraine headaches
If your migraine headaches are interfering with your daily life, treatment should
include organizing your lifestyle so that you’re away from your triggers as much
as possible. Even daylight and everyday noises, such as children playing and
dogs barking, can trigger excruciating pain. Your doctor may also suggest that
you take preventive medications.
When migraines strike, many people find it helpful (and others say it’s
absolutely necessary) to rest in a quiet, darkened room until their symptoms
lessen. Some migraine sufferers lie in bed and pull the covers over their head
or wear masks to block out as much light and sound as possible. Painkillers
such as aspirin or naproxen can provide relief, particularly when taken as
soon as the headache starts. The earlier you take them, the better.
If migraines make you nauseous and/or cause you to vomit, taking medicine
by mouth may not work. In this case, other options are available, including
taking medications rectally or intravenously. Your doctor can also prescribe a
type of medication called an antiemetic to stop nausea and/or vomiting.
Your doctor may also prescribe other medications effective for migraines.
They include triptans, which block the release of chemicals that trigger
migraine pain (Imitrex, Zomig, and others); dihydroergotamine, a drug which
narrows veins and arteries; and butalbital (Fiornal or Fioricet), a barbiturate.
Some people with migraines experience nasal congestion, runny eyes, or
other symptoms that may suggest a sinus headache. These headaches
should not be confused with sinus headaches because they won’t respond to
medical treatment for sinusitis. (For more on sinus headaches, see the
upcoming section “Suffering from Sinus Headaches.”)
81
Chapter 6: Head Cases: Migraines and Other Types of Craniofacial Pain

Preventing migraines
If you get migraine headaches more than two or three times a month, then pre-
ventive treatment should be at the top of your to-do list. The first step is to
identify and stay away from your headache triggers as much as possible. (You
can read about identifying and side-stepping pain triggers in Chapter 17.) 
Your doctor may also prescribe medications such as beta-blockers to block 
the release of adrenaline, which can trigger migraines, or she may order an
anti-seizure medication called Divalproex, which can help prevent migraines.
Typically, migraine sufferers take these medications at a time when the
headaches usually strike, such as before a menstrual period or on weekends.
Some people with migraine headaches experience weekend headaches or
headaches brought on by sleeping more than usual. If weekend headaches
are a problem for you, avoid sleeping in on weekends. Try to wake up at the
same time on weekends as you do during the week.
Too little sleep is also a problem for migraine sufferers. People who get
migraines need sufficient sleep. In fact, fatigue is one of the most common
triggers of migraine headaches. In other words, playing poker until 3 a.m. and
then getting up at 6 a.m. to go fishing is a no-no if you get migraine
headaches.
In addition, some patients with migraine headaches believe that certain foods
trigger the condition. However, not all people with migraines have dietary
triggers, and sensitivity to certain foods differs for each migraine sufferer. In
other words, chocolate may trigger a migraine for you, but not for your
coworker who also gets migraines. His triggers may be peanuts and wine,
which don’t bother you at all. (Read the sidebar on common migraine trig-
gers for more information.)
Are you a chocoholic? Sometimes chocolate is a migraine trigger, but don’t go
on the wagon right away. Just savor a smaller than usual amount of chocolate
for a week or so and note whether your migraines decrease in frequency or
severity. If not, your beloved chocolate probably isn’t a trigger, so it’s a keeper.
Keep a diary of the foods you eat and the drinks you consume and eliminate
any suspicious foods from your diet so that you can see whether their
absence eases the frequency and severity of your headaches.
82
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Suffering from Sinus Headaches
Some people suffer from a chronic inflammation or infection of the sinuses
(sinusitis), which causes a severe headache. They may be allergic to a variety
of items, ranging from cats and dogs to dust and many other possible allergic
triggers. If this is your situation, try to determine what you’re allergic to (ask
your doctor for help) and if you can, avoid that trigger. If that means you
need to stay away from Fluffy or your partner’s beloved cat, then do it! It’s
better than walking around with a very bad headache most of the time.
If you have sinusitis you may need antibiotics. Your doctor may also pre-
scribe a nasal spray to help keep your nasal passages clear.
83
Chapter 6: Head Cases: Migraines and Other Types of Craniofacial Pain
Common migraine triggers
According 
to 
the 
National 
Headache
Foundation, certain foods may trigger migraine
headaches; if they trigger migraines in you,
avoid them. All the foods in this list contain tyra-
mine, a substance that’s produced in the natural
breakdown of the amino acid tyrosine. Tyramine
levels increase in foods when they’re aged or
aren’t fresh.
 Ripened cheeses, such as Cheddar,
Emmentaler, Stilton, Brie, and Camembert
(American, cottage, and cream cheese, as
well as Velveeta, are okay.)
 Herring (pickled or dried)
 Chocolate
 Anything fermented, pickled, or marinated
 Sour cream (no more than 1/2 cup daily)
 Nuts, peanut butter, or foods such as crackers
or cookies that contain nuts
 Sourdough bread, breads and crackers
containing cheese or chocolate
 Broad beans, lima beans, fava beans, or
snow peas
 Foods containing monosodium glutamate
(MSG), such as soy sauce, meat tenderiz-
ers, and seasoned salt
 Figs, raisins, papayas, avocados, or red
plums (no more than 1/2 cup daily)
 Citrus fruits (no more than 1/2 cup daily)
 Bananas (no more than 1/2 banana daily)
 Pizza (because of the cheese)
 Excessive amounts of tea, coffee, or cola
beverages (no more than 2 cups daily)
 Sausage, bologna, pepperoni, salami,
summer sausage, or hot dogs
 Chicken livers

Understanding Cluster Headaches
Middle-aged men are the primary victims of cluster headaches. Often, these
headache sufferers have one attack a day for one to three months. Then, hap-
pily, they go into remission for months to years. However, some unfortunate
people have cluster headaches with no interruption.
Cluster headaches usually occur at the same time and often wake up their
victims in the middle of the night. Pain always occurs on one side of the head
and in and around the eye (see Figure 6-1). The pain of a cluster headache is
severe, but usually (whew) only lasts about 30 minutes to one hour. People
experiencing cluster headaches are usually anxious and restless. Other symp-
toms include nasal congestion, a watery discharge from the nose, watery
eyes, and a condition called Horner’s syndrome, which causes a droopy eyelid
and contraction of the pupil of the eye.
Diagnosing cluster headaches is based on its distinctive group of symptoms
and by ruling out other problems. Because cluster headaches are so frequent
and severe, they can make it impossible to work, care for children, or carry
out day-to-day tasks.
Prevention is extremely important. You and your doctor can head off cluster
headaches (pun intended) with some of the same medicines used for
migraine headaches, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and a triptan. Oxygen
inhalation also helps many people when they’re having an acute attack. So, it
is important to discuss treatment options with your doctor.
Tackling Thunderclap Headaches
Thunderclap headaches get their names for how they arrive: Boom, just like a
thunderclap. One minute you’re fine, and the next minute, you have a severe
headache. The pain of thunderclap headaches peaks in a minute or so and then,
blessedly, fades over the next few hours. A less severe headache may follow.
Thunderclap headaches occur most frequently in women older than age 45.
These headaches are secondary headaches that can have serious causes, such
as bleeding in the brain or a blood clot in the sinuses. If you ever experience a
thunderclap headache or think you may be having one, seek immediate med-
ical attention. If bleeding in the brain is causing the headache, you may need
emergency surgery.
84
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Paying Attention to Neck Pain
Neck pain is just that: a pain in the neck, and far too often also in the shoul-
ders, arms, and head. It affects about 10 percent of the population each year.
Neck pain may be caused by a whiplash injury, where the neck is jerked forward
and back in a car crash. It may also be caused by changes in the spine due to
arthritis, aging, or muscle strain. Often, the cause of neck pain is occupational
and may be brought on by sitting at a computer desk for long periods of time.
If the problem is your computer, make sure that your monitor is set so that
your eyes naturally hit about the middle of the screen. If not, adjust your
chair and your screen until they do. Make sure that your knees are slightly
lower than your hips.
Some simple suggestions can considerably ease neck pain:
 Keep your head back, over your spine, to reduce neck strain.
 Take frequent breaks if you drive long distances or work long hours at
your computer.
85
Chapter 6: Head Cases: Migraines and Other Types of Craniofacial Pain
Emergency headaches
If you have any of the following symptoms, seek
immediate medical care:
 A sudden, severe headache, unlike one
you’ve ever had (which may be due to bleed-
ing in the brain and is a medical emergency
for many reasons, including the fact that it
can cause severe damage to the brain)
 A headache that strikes after heavy exer-
cise (which may also be caused by bleed-
ing in the brain)
 Fever and neck stiffness associated with
the headache (which may be due to bacterial
meningitis or viral encephalitis)
 Seizures or lessening of mental function,
which may be symptoms of brain tumors
 Weakness of the arms, legs, or face mus-
cles, which may suggest a transient
ischemic attack (a short interruption of
blood flow to the brain)
 A recent head injury, which may be causing
bleeding in the brain
 A new headache associated with nausea,
vomiting, and visual changes
 Alcoholic beverages (The National Headache
Foundation recommends that you limit your-
self to two normal size drinks selected from
Haute Sauterne, Riesling, Seagram’s VO, or
Cutty Sark)

 If you grind or clench your teeth during sleep, consider using a night
brace, available from your dentist.
 Don’t tuck your phone under your chin. Use a headset or speakerphone
for long conversations.
 Pull your shoulder blades together and then relax. Pull your shoulders
down while leaning your head to each side to stretch your neck muscles.
Stretch your neck frequently if you work at a desk. Shrug your shoulders
up and down.
 Sometimes acupuncture helps. Read about acupuncture in Chapter 15.
 Stretch and strengthen the muscles that support your neck, which helps
make the job of holding up your head easier. Walking provides a workout
for the neck muscles. These simple movements can translate into much
less pain!
For many years the standard treatment for neck pain was wearing a brace to
hold up the head and give the neck a rest. Now experts know that movement
is critical to keeping the neck and surrounding muscles healthy. However, if
you have severe neck pain, it’s important to exercise your neck only under
the supervision of a physical therapist or other medical professional. Deep
massage is also helpful for people with chronic muscular neck pain.

The Odd Couple: Injuries 
and Strokes
In This Chapter
 Understanding complex regional pain syndrome
 Exploring the different types of spinal cord injury pain
 Thinking about the pain associated with strokes
 Identifying the different types of brain injury
Jack was driving home after working late Friday night when his car was vio-
lently rear-ended by a drunk driver. Jack survived the accident, but he suf-
fered an injury to his left leg. He recovered well after rehabilitation. But months
later, Jack was stricken in his left leg with a very painful condition known as
complex regional pain syndrome. About the same time, Marie, one of Jack’s
coworkers, suffered a major stroke. Months later, she, too, was stricken with
pain in her left leg — different causes, but the same end condition.
This chapter covers major chronic pain conditions that result from injury to
the peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, or the brain, regardless of whether the
injury is from a car accident or other injury or from a stroke.
You need to know a few caveats about the pain-causing conditions discussed
in this chapter. After an injury has healed, a lot is known about the previous
harm to the body, but much remains still undiscovered. You may ask your
doctor a question like “Why do I have post-stroke central pain, but my
mother, who had a similar stroke years ago, didn’t have it?” The answer is
that no one really knows why. In this chapter, you discover what is known
today about pain conditions that result from damage to the nervous system.

Getting the Lowdown on Complex
Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)
Complex regional pain syndrome is long-term pain that may strike after an injury
to an arm or a leg. The hallmark of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is
pain that’s through the ceiling and agonizingly painful when compared to the
feeling from the trigger that set it off, which may be something as ordinary as a
cool breeze brushing against your shirt. (Some people never identify the trig-
ger.) On a scale of 1 to 10, the pain from CRPS is about a 50. Unfortunately, the
pain of CRPS gets worse over time. It may not even show up until long after the
damage has healed. (For more information about CRPS, see Chapter 11.)
CRPS is also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or causalgia, a Civil War
term that described intense pain felt by some soldiers long after their
wounds healed.
CRPS probably doesn’t have only one cause, but instead this medical syn-
drome may result from many causes with similar symptoms. Scientists know
that injured nerves can become active spontaneously, sending impulses to
the spinal cord even without painful stimulus. This abnormal activity depends
on inflammation and scarring with constriction of the nerve and other factors
that are difficult to detect (diagnose). In short, the sympathetic nervous
system can be a culprit that’s maintaining the chronic pain of CRPS. (See
Chapter 2 for information about the sympathetic nervous system.)
Identifying CRPS requires considerable skill and guesswork on the part of the
neurologist or other diagnostician. No specific test is available to diagnose
the condition; the common thread is the excruciating pain felt by you or our
loved one. As a result, CRPS is diagnosed by first ruling out other conditions.
For example, doctors may use bone scans to identify changes in the bone and
in blood circulation.
Symptoms of CRPS may include color changes in the arm, hand, leg, or foot.
The changes may vary from red to white to blue at different times, and there
is excessive hair loss over the painful extremity. The skin may become very
thick, and a significant amount of swelling may occur in the affected extremity.
Excessive sweating may occur over the affected area, and usually the sufferer
feels severe burning pain.
If you discover you have CRPS, you may be one of the lucky ones who recovers
spontaneously from the symptoms. However, some people have unremitting pain
and crippling, irreversible physical changes despite treatment. Some doctors
believe that early treatment is helpful in limiting the severity of the disorder.
Treatment is focused on lessening pain and includes techniques you read
about in this book, such as physical therapy, surgery, and medication. (See
Chapter 11 for more information about treatments for CRPS.)

Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Suffering a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)
The spinal cord contains cells with axons that form pathways to the brain for
conducting information from your body. Also, it contains pathways from the
brain to cells in the spinal cord that control your movements. The spinal
cord is surrounded by bones (vertebrae which make up the spinal column or
back bones). (Read more about the spinal cord and its role in carrying infor-
mation to and from your brain in Chapter 2.)
Spinal cord injury (SCI) includes injury to the cord itself, as well as to one or
more vertebrae. Severe damage to the cord can eliminate intentional move-
ments controlled by all the regions of the spinal cord below the injury. All
sensations from below the injury can also be lost.
Because the treatments differ, you need to understand the distinction between
a spinal cord injury and the type of back injury pain that is specifically caused
by pinched nerves (for example, by ruptured discs). Even if you break a verte-
bra or vertebrae, you may still not have injured the spinal cord, but chances
are you will have pinched nerves. And the pinched nerves can cause pain in
regions supplied by nerves coming in between the injured vertebrae. This
type of pain is called at-level (at the level of injury) or segmental. (Chapter 5
covers issues concerning chronic back pain.)
If you have segmental pain, you may develop allodynia and hyperalgesia in
the painful region. Allodynia is pain caused by something that usually does
not elicit pain, such as shaking hands with someone. Hyperalgesia is an
extremely painful reaction to something minor, such as a soft breeze, that
would normally only hurt a little.
If you’re unlucky enough to have vertebrae that are so badly crushed or dis-
placed that they constrict and damage your spinal cord, the damage can cause
the cells in the pain pathways of your spinal cord to go haywire, resulting in pain.
(Yes, we know that haywire is not an accepted medical term. But we thought
we’d use something a little more descriptive than abnormal spontaneous 
activity, which is what scientists call it when, for no detectable reason, cells in
the pain pathways send pain messages to the brain. See Chapter 2 for more infor-
mation on abnormal spontaneous activity in pain pathways.)
These haywire pain messages can result in chronic pain that is felt below the
injury called below-level pain. This type of pain is often described by victims
as horrible.
If you have pain from a SCI, you may hurt severely at times and have little or
no pain at other times. Pain may come and go with your daily circumstances.
For example, fatigue, weather changes (particularly cold), and stress can all
affect your pain levels.
89
Chapter 7: The Odd Couple: Injuries and Strokes

Research has shown that your level of injury and how you were injured can
determine whether you develop chronic pain after a SCI. Paradoxically, lower
levels of injury tend to mean more pain, while higher levels mean less pain.
Treatments for SCI are similar to those for other pain conditions, including
techniques you read about in this book, such as physical therapy and med-
ication. Surgery may be necessary to repair vertebral displacement or other
causes of traction on the spinal cord. SCI can cause ulcers, spasticity (a condi-
tion in which some of the body’s muscles are continuously contracted) and
other health problems, which in turn can cause chronic pain.
Dealing with Central Post-Stroke Pain
A stroke occurs when blood can’t reach the brain, either because blood is
blocked from getting through a vessel or a blood vessel bursts. The result is
an injury to the brain, hence the popular term for stroke: brain attack.
Five percent of the people who have a brain attack develop Central Post
Stroke Pain (CPSP).
Some stroke victims with central pain notice it when the stroke hits, but for
most victims, the pain strikes several months later. It may be a burning,
throbbing, shooting, or stabbing pain. If you have central pain resulting from
a stroke, you’ll feel it in the part of the body affected by the stroke.
According to the Pain Relief Foundation, other characteristics include
 A loss of feeling in the affected part, such as not being able to tell the
difference between hot and cold.
 Hypersensitivity to touch. In some patients, light touch, such as clothing
brushing against the skin, causes severe pain. In some cases, a minor
movement may cause severe pain (allodynia).
 For one in five people with CPSP, the pain gets better over a period of
years. A third of these people will get better in the first year.
Strokes vary in the location and size of brain damage they cause, producing
different symptoms for different people. For example, Lois may have severe
chronic pain after her stroke, but her roommate, Roberta, is more fortunate
and has none.
Chronic pain after a stroke is usually due to damage to cells or axons in the
individual’s pain pathway. We hear you sighing and asking: “Shouldn’t damage
to the pain pathway get rid of pain?” Well, it can, but, curiously, it can also
cause chronic pain.
90
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Surviving Traumatic Brain Injury
A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a blow, jolt, or penetrating injury that leads to
damage to the head, disrupting brain function. Of course, not all blows or
jolts to the head result in a TBI. But when they do, TBI may cause short or
long-term problems with independent function.
Symptoms of a brain injury can be mild to severe, depending on the amount
of damage. Some symptoms show up right away, while others may not appear
until several days or weeks after the injury. Headaches are a common long-
and short-term problem after a TBI.
According to the Brain Injury Association, other symptoms may include (but
are not limited to):
 Spinal fluid (thin water-looking liquid) coming from the ears or nose
 Loss of consciousness
 Dilated or unequally sized pupils
 Vision changes (blurred vision or seeing double, inability to tolerate
bright light, loss of eye movement, blindness)
 Dizziness, balance problems
 Respiratory failure (not breathing)
 Coma (not alert and unable to respond to others) or a semicomatose state
 Paralysis, difficulty moving body parts, weakness, poor coordination
 Slow pulse
91
Chapter 7: The Odd Couple: Injuries and Strokes
Spotting the signs of a stroke
If you have any stroke symptoms, seek immedi-
ate medical attention. Symptoms include the fol-
lowing, all of which come on suddenly:
 Numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg —
especially on one side of the body
 Confusion, trouble speaking or understanding
 Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
 Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance
or coordination
 Severe headache with no known cause
If you’ve experienced any of these symptoms,
you may have had a mini-stroke and are at risk
for a larger stroke. Ask your doctor whether you
can lower your risk for stroke by taking aspirin
or using other means. (For more on prevention,
see the section called “Stroke prevention,” later
in this chapter.)

 Slow breathing rate, with an increase in blood pressure
 Vomiting
 Lethargy (sluggish, sleepy, gets tired easily)
 Confusion
 Ringing in the ears or changes in ability to hear
Half of all brain injuries are due to transportation-related accidents, such as
car, motorcycle, and bicycle accidents, as well as injuries to pedestrians.
About 20 percent of brain injuries are caused by violence, including firearm
use and child abuse. For people ages 75 years and older, brain injuries are
most often caused by falls.
In addition, blasts are a leading cause of TBIs for active duty military personnel
in war zones.
The chronic pain triggered by brain damage usually results in one of the
following types of injuries:
 Concussion: A concussion is by far the most frequently occurring type of
traumatic brain injury. Also called a mild traumatic brain injury, concus-
sions cause a temporary loss of mental activity. Often the individual
won’t remember what happened immediately after the injury. Concussions
can result from any blow to or jarring of the head, but generally don’t
involve bleeding or punctures.
 Diffuse Axonal Injury: Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) is the result of a TBI
and whiplash. With this type of injury, axons throughout the brain are
severely stretched or distorted by movement of the brain in the skull.
And because axons are responsible for communication between brain
cells, such an injury can disrupt important functions resulting in a coma.
DAI is typically the underlying injury in shaken baby syndrome.
 Contusion: A contusion is bleeding in the brain. It basically describes a
bruised brain!
 Coup-Contrecoup Injury: Coup-Contrecoup Injury refers to contusions
occurring at the site of the injury as well as the opposite side of the
brain. It is caused by the brain swinging back and forth against the skull.
(Brains are not meant to swing back and forth.)
For all brain injuries, treatment should begin at the time of the injury. The first
two goals are to stabilize the person and prevent further injury. About half of
all severely injured people will require surgery. Recovery from a brain injury is
a difficult and long process, often requiring physical therapy and retraining.
The good news is that undamaged regions of the brain can often be trained to
take over functions lost or reduced by damage to other parts of the brain.

Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Preventing Spinal Cord 
and Brain Injuries
The bottom line in regard to injury to the spinal cord and brain — regardless
of the cause — is that the resulting pain syndromes and related conditions
can be severe and debilitating. Prevention for all these conditions is mostly
common sense: practice safety to prevent spinal and brain injuries and prac-
tice a healthy lifestyle to prevent strokes. This section provides some tips on
how to add these practices to your daily life. (Unfortunately, CRPS has no
specific preventive measures.)
Spinal cord and traumatic 
brain injury prevention
The following tips to preventing spinal cord injuries are from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Motor vehicles
Motor vehicles are the leading cause of SCI in the United States for people
under age 65. Here are some safety tips for driving and riding in motor vehicles.
 Always wear a seat belt.
 Secure or buckle children into age- and weight-appropriate child safety
seats.
 Secure or buckle children under 12 years old in the back seat to avoid
air bag injuries.
 Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
 Don’t ride in a car with a driver impaired by alcohol or drugs.
93
Chapter 7: The Odd Couple: Injuries and Strokes
Seeing the signs of a concussion
Immediate signs of concussion, seen within
seconds or minutes of an injury, include loss of
consciousness; impaired attention, such as a
vacant stare, delayed responses, and inability
to focus; slurred or incoherent speech; lack of
coordination; disorientation; extreme emotional
reactions; and memory problems.
The following symptoms can occur hours or
even days or weeks after a concussion: persis-
tent headache; dizziness/vertigo; poor attention
and concentration; memory problems; nausea
or vomiting; fatigue; irritability; intolerance of
bright lights and/or loud noises; anxiety and/or
depression; and disturbed sleep.

 Prevent others from driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs.
 Raise the headrest on the seats of the vehicle so that the headrest
contacts the back of the head, not the neck.
 Avoid talking on cell phones while driving a motor vehicle.
Falls
Falls are the leading cause of SCI for people ages 65 and older. To prevent falls,
take the following steps:
 Secure banisters and handrails at all stairwells.
 Use a step stool with a grab bar to reach objects on high shelves.
 Place nonslip mats on the bathtub and shower floor.
 Install grab bars in the shower and bathtub.
 Exercise regularly to keep muscle tone and balance.
 Wear sturdy nonslip shoes.
 When possible, reduce the use of sedatives or other medications that
increase the risk of falling.
 Perform a home safety check and remove things that may be tripped over.
 Use safety gates at the bottom and top of stairs when young children are
around.
 Install window guards in windows above the first floor.
 Consider installing a ramp to a porch rather than using stairs.
Sports and recreation
The majority of sports and recreation injuries occur among infants to adults
age 29. Following are tips to help make sports and recreation activities safer.
 Wear a helmet when riding a bike, motorcycle, scooter, or skateboard;
in-line skating and roller-skating; skiing or snowboarding; horseback
riding; and during football, ice hockey, batting; and running the bases in
baseball and softball.
 Make sure that the water is deep enough before you dive in head-first. If
water is too shallow, you may be seriously injured. Entering feet-first is
safer than diving.
 Wear appropriate safety gear when engaging in sports activities.
 Avoid head-first moves, such as tackling with the top of your head or
sliding head-first into a base.
 Insist on spotters when performing activities that put you at risk, such
as new gymnastics moves.
94
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Firearms
Firearms are a leading cause of spinal cord injury. If you have firearms in your
home, the following precautions can make your home safer:
 Keep firearms stored unloaded in a locked cabinet or safe.
 Store bullets secured in a separate location.
Stroke prevention
The following tips to preventing a stroke are adapted from the National
Stroke Association.
 Know your blood pressure and have it checked at least annually. If it’s
elevated, work with your doctor to keep it under control. High blood
pressure (hypertension) is a leading cause of stroke. If the higher number
(your systolic blood pressure) is consistently above 120 or the lower
number (your diastolic blood pressure) is consistently over 80, talk to
your doctor.
 Find out whether you have atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an
irregular heartbeat that changes how your heart works and allows blood
to collect in the chambers of your heart. This blood, which is not
moving through your body, tends to clot. The beating of your heart can
move a clot into the blood supply to part of your brain, causing a stroke.
If you have AF, your doctor may prescribe medicines called blood thin-
ners. Aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin) are the most commonly pre-
scribed treatments.
 If you smoke, stop. Smoking doubles the risk for stroke.
 If you drink alcohol, use moderation. Studies show that drinking up to
two alcoholic drinks per day can reduce your risk for stroke by about
half. But more alcohol than this each day can increase your risk for
stroke by three times and also lead to liver disease, accidents, and more.
If you drink, limit yourself to two drinks each day.
 Find out whether you have high cholesterol (a soft, waxy fat/lipid in the
bloodstream and all body cells). If your total cholesterol level is over 200,
talk to your doctor. You may be at an increased risk for stroke.
 If you’re diabetic, follow your doctor’s advice carefully. Having diabetes
puts you at an increased risk for stroke, but if you control your diabetes,
you may lower your risk for stroke. Your doctor can prescribe lifestyle
changes and medicine to help control your diabetes.
 Include exercise in your daily activities. A brisk walk for as little as 30
minutes a day may reduce your risk for stroke.
95
Chapter 7: The Odd Couple: Injuries and Strokes

 Adopt a lower sodium (salt), lower fat diet. By cutting down on sodium
and fat in your diet, you may lower your blood pressure and, most
importantly, lower your risk for stroke.
 Ask your doctor whether you have vascular (blood circulation) problems
that may increase your risk for stroke. For example, fatty deposits can
block the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your brain. This
kind of blockage, if untreated, can cause stroke.
 If you have blood problems such as sickle cell disease, severe anemia
(lower than normal number of red blood cells), or other diseases, work
with your doctor to manage these problems. Left untreated, these can
cause stroke.

Burn Pain
In This Chapter
 Understanding burn classifications
 Identifying when burns need treatment at burn centers
 Managing chronic health problems caused by burns
 Discovering how posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is connected to chronic pain
M
ost people think of severe burns as acute injuries, so you may wonder
why a book about chronic pain contains a chapter about burn pain. The
truth is that burns are one of the most preventable causes of chronic pain.
Many serious burns ultimately lead to chronic pain. For example, researchers
at the New England Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, studied 358 burn
survivors. These survivors had burns over 59 percent of their bodies. Many
were burned years ago — on average, they were studied 12 years from the time
of the burn injury. Yet even though it had been more than a decade since their
burns, over half of this group (52 percent) had constant and chronic pain as a
direct result of their former burns.
In addition to the physical trauma of burns, the event that caused the injury
can lead to a mental and emotional problem called posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD). This form of anxiety develops after a terrifying and sometimes
pain-inducing event. PTSD is sometimes thought to cause chronic pain, but
its impact is often overlooked or misunderstood. Fortunately, treatments and
resources described in the section called “Understanding the PTSD/Chronic
Pain Connection,” later in this chapter can help you deal with the problem.
Lamenting the Tragedy of Burns
Burn injuries in the United States result in more than 1 million emergency
department visits and about 3,000 deaths a year. Children and the elderly
have the toughest time recovering from their burns as well as from the hor-
rific events that cause them. Tragically, children account for more than a
third of all burn injuries in the United States. A surprising 75 percent of all
burns are believed preventable.

While you’re driving in traffic, or when you’re home or with your children on
the playground, you and your loved ones may risk burn injuries from a range
of sources:
 Fires: Burns from fire, often referred to as thermal fires, can be caused by
anything — flames, liquids, gases, and objects — if temperatures exceed
115º F (46°C), and the hot substance comes in contact with your skin. The
higher the temperature, the faster the skin burns, and in only 3 1/2 min-
utes, the heat from a house fire can reach more than 1,100° F.
 Chemical burns: Chemical burns are caused by strong acids or alkalines
touching your skin. Unfortunately, you can find these products stored
under your bathroom sink and on the utility shelf in your garage.
Dangerous chemicals used in the home include bleach, boric acid, paint
thinner, and products used to clear drains. If you have children or grand-
children around, keep your cleaning supplies locked up! In addition,
handle these chemicals gingerly yourself.
 Radiation burns: Radiation burns are most often the result of spending
too much time in the sun or in a tanning bed. Excessive X-rays or nonsolar
radiation can also cause this type of burn. Deep radiation burns from X-
rays may not be visible for days or weeks after exposure.
 Electric shock: Electrical burns may be deceptive because often the only
visible damage occurs at the point where the electrical current entered
and exited the body. However, on its way through your body, the electri-
cal current may seriously damage internal organs. Lightning strikes,
high-voltage power lines, or faulty electrical equipment can all cause
electrical burns. Next time you’re at a summer picnic and a thunder-
storm starts up, pack up and get out! The safest place is in your car and
not under a tree!
Classifying Burns
Burns can cause serious damage to the victim’s skin, harm the body’s organs,
and elicit horrific pain. The level of pain suffered depends on the dimensions
of the injury. The deeper and wider the injury, the more excruciating the pain.
Burns are classified by how deep they go, as well as by the percentage of the
body that they cover (see Figure 8-1):
 When burns are limited to the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin),
they’re first-degree burns. They cause pain, redness, swelling, and
minor damage to the skin. The skin is dry, but blister-free.
98
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

 When damage from burns reaches the dermis (the next deeper layer of
skin), these burns are second-degree burns. Second-degree burns are
very painful and cause redness, swelling, and blistering. The skin is
moist and weepy. They’ll heal in a couple of weeks, but some second-
degree burns require surgery and skin grafting.
 If burns reach the next layer, the site of the subcutaneous tissue, they’re
third-degree burns. In a third-degree burn, the skin layer is lost, and
nerve endings may be destroyed, causing a loss of pain sensation in the
area. However, the area of the third-degree burn is surrounded by
second-degree burns, which cause severe pain.
Charred veins and nerve endings are visible with third-degree burns.
Remnants of skin are leathery. Third-degree burns cause scars and can
result in loss of function. They won’t heal without surgery, and they’re the
burns that can cause chronic pain, even though other sensations are lost.
 Fourth-degree burns — the most severe type of burn — involve damage
and destruction to the underlying muscle, bone, ligaments, and tendons
and will require skin grafting along with reconstructive surgery when
possible. At times, amputation is needed for fourth-degree burns.

Chapter 8: Burn Pain

The percentage of the body that a burn covers is called total body surface
area (TBSA).The more TBSA covered, the more serious the injury.
Preventing Chronic Pain
To prevent burn pain from becoming a chronic problem, you need to manage
the pain immediately after the injury. Untreated pain can spin out of control
and cause long-lasting problems and heightened anxiety.
Here’s a good example of the physical processes that cause trouble later on
when adequate pain management isn’t administered after a burn injury:
 The burn causes a condition called hypermetabolism, which means that
your body’s energy output increases. In addition, the stress of the injury
causes the release of catecholamine neurotransmitters, which further
heighten your body’s energy output. The increased hypermetabolsim (dare
we say hyper-hyper-metabolism?) has the effect of decreasing blood flow
to the area of the burn. But your body greatly needs that blood flow to heal
back up again.
 At the same time that this decreased blood flow is happening, the excru-
ciating pain of the burn can curb your immune system, which you need
for healing and avoiding infections and other complications. The acute
pain also derails blood flow. So, if the pain is not dealt with aggressively,
the injury doesn’t heal.
Treating Burns
It’s important to do everything possible to heal well and control pain in the
days and weeks after a burn injury in order to prevent acute pain from mor-
phing into chronic pain.
After the initial emergency of caring for burn victims, treating the injury means
that the patient must endure a lot of painful procedures, including the removal
of dead tissue, which is called debridement. The doctor or other medical pro-
fessional must also clean the burn area, replace dressings, exercise burned
limbs and joints, and possibly perform a skin graft. In addition, physical and
occupational therapy begins as soon as possible to return function to the burn
area. Many burn victims also require repeated surgeries.
100
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Some long-term medical issues that occur for burn victims are
 Scarring: After the initial phase of a burn, your skin generates scar
tissue. Getting appropriate treatment during the scarring process is
extremely important to prevent chronic problems.
If a burn injury doesn’t heal on its own in a week to ten days, the doctor
cuts away dead tissue and performs skin grafts. Without such treatment,
the skin regenerated at this point is very thin and only marginally pro-
tective. In addition, the area heals with ugly protruding scars called gran-
ulations or hypertrophic scarring, which grow out of control. To prevent
granulations, burn victims often wear garments that put pressure on the
burn area.
If you or a loved one has suffered a severe burn, prevention of long-term
scars is a serious challenge. The victim’s face, hands, and so on may be
extremely disfigured, causing serious adjustment problems. The good
news is that treatments are being developed all the time, including facial
transplants.
 Contractures: As scar tissue forms after a burn, the skin contracts, and
joints can no longer move normally. To prevent muscles from shortening
(called contractures), which can cause deformities, burn victims must go
through extremely painful exercises of the involved joints. If these exer-
cises are done repeatedly, they can prevent the problem. However, some-
times contractures have to be released surgically or are permanent.
 Loss of the ability to sweat: Sweat glands are destroyed in second- or
third-degree burns and don’t regenerate. Because sweating helps regu-
late body temperature, victims of extensive burns may not do well in
hot, cold, or humid environments and often have to restrict exercise.
 Skin problems: Deep burns destroy glands in the skin so that the skin
becomes very dry. In addition, new skin is weak and vulnerable and
needs to be protected.
Understanding the PTSD/Chronic 
Pain Connection
Severe burns are caused by horrifying events, such as burning buildings,
chemical explosions, or other frightening calamities. One of the most difficult
health problems resulting from such events is post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), a chronic anxiety syndrome in which the burn victim keeps mentally
re-experiencing the event. People with the disorder may have a difficult time
healing, both physically and emotionally.
101
Chapter 8: Burn Pain

PTSD may strike soon after the burn has occurred or months later. Symptoms
of PTSD include
 Obsessively recalling the event over and over again, so much that it
intrudes on other thoughts
 Avoiding things associated with the event
 Experiencing nightmares
 Feeling emotionally numb
 Being on guard, hyper-aroused, overly alert, or easily startled
 Experiencing flashbacks
PTSD is usually considered chronic if it lasts longer than three months. One
of the unhappy results of the condition is that anxiety disorders and substance
abuse are common for people with chronic PTSD.
102
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
Praising burn centers
Severe burns should be treated at one of the 125
specialized burn centers located across the
country. (Military personnel with burns are
treated at the Brooke Army Medical Center in
San Antonio, Texas.) Getting appropriate treat-
ment can help victims avoid chronic pain and
other health problems later.
Burn centers have specially trained staffs to
treat people with extensive burn injuries. The
American College of Surgeons has developed
criteria for the types of burn injuries that should
be treated in a specialized burn center:
 Burns that damage the first and second
layers of skin (partial thickness burns) that
are greater than 10 percent of the total body
surface area (TBSA)
 Burns that involve the face, hands, feet,
genitalia, the pelvic floor, or major joints
 Third-degree burns in any age group
 Electrical burns, including lightning injury
 Chemical burns
 Inhalation injury
 Burn injury in patients with preexisting med-
ical problems such as cancer or heart dis-
ease that may complicate management,
prolong recovery, or affect survival
 Any patients with burns and trauma (such as
fractures), for whom the burn injury poses
the greatest risk of morbidity or mortality
 Burned children in hospitals without quali-
fied personnel or equipment for the care of
children
 Burn injury in patients who require special
social, emotional, or long-term rehabilitative
intervention

The International Association for Traumatic Stress Studies (IATSS) has found
that PTSD is linked to development of chronic pain. According to the IATSS,
people with lasting PTSD symptoms frequently report high rates of health
problems. The bottom line is that symptoms of PTSD overlap with those
associated with chronic physical pain, such as that from burns.
According to another organization that studies PTSD, the PTSD Alliance,
symptoms of PTSD include the following physical complaints, which may be
accompanied by depression:
 Chronic pain with no medical basis (frequently gynecological problems
in women)
 Chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia
 Stomach pain or other digestive problems, such as irritable bowel
syndrome or alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation
 Breathing problems or asthma
 Headaches
 Muscle cramps or aches such as low back pain
 Cardiovascular problems
 Sleep disorders
It’s important to seek counseling for PTSD from a professional specifically
trained to help people with the syndrome. For example, PTSD is such a huge
problem for military victims that the VA has a specific program to assist sol-
diers with the disorder.
A therapeutic approach called exposure therapy is effective for many people
with PTSD. The therapy involves talking about the event repeatedly with a
counselor in order to get control over your thoughts and fears. Specific med-
ications, including some antidepressants, also help.
Getting Help
Specialized groups help burn victims and their families, they can also help
you cope with posttraumatic stress.

In This Chapter
 Discovering symptoms and major causes of chronic digestive pain
 Understanding your treatment options
 Weighing the risk of taking NSAIDs
 Analyzing chronic pain caused by chronic bladder diseases
 Finding a physician who specializes in digestive health
You may wonder what the common denominator is between digestion
and urination, so here it is: When you eat food and drink liquids (which
hopefully were tasty and nutritious), your digestion processes it all, pulling
out the elements it needs. It then eliminates what it doesn’t use. Urination is
the end result of a similar process by the kidneys, which takes out what is
needed by your body and eliminates the rest in the urine.
And usually life goes on with little disruption. However, if these body systems
don’t work well, the results can range from the nausea and bloating of dyspepsia
to the severe pain of Crohn’s disease in the digestive system. And in the urinary
tract, urethritis and interstitial cystitis are two painful chronic diseases that may
develop when things go awry.
Some of these chronic conditions are beyond your control. As with the color
of your eyes, you inherit a predisposition to develop them from previous gen-
erations. However, many diseases are caused by — or worsened by — what
and how much you eat, drink, or even smoke.
Looking at Your Digestive 
and Urinary Systems
Simply put, your digestive system breaks food down into nutrients so that your
body can use them, and then it excretes the rest. From your mouth to your
rectum, it consists of the organs labeled in Figure 9-1.

Your kidneys and urinary tract get rid of the waste left over by your cells and
organs after they’ve completed their jobs. These organs are shown in Figure 9-2.
Because many digestive and urinary conditions can cause relentless hurting,
we can’t possibly cover them all in one chapter. The following sections touch
on major diseases and offer you resources to find out how to diagnose and
treat them.

Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Alcohol liver disease
The liver is the body’s largest organ, with a startling 500 metabolic and regu-
latory functions. Drinking too much alcohol for too long can cause fatty liver,
alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, three progressively worse liver diseases.
Each one refers to harm done to the liver, a major organ that you can’t live
without. Of the three, cirrhosis is the most serious liver disease and can’t be
cured. The person with cirrhosis needs a liver transplant to survive.
Here are some facts about these diseases:
 Fatty liver, also called steatosis, is a buildup of fat in the liver cells. It has
the dubious distinction of being the No. 1, alcohol-related health problem.
(Fatty liver can sometimes be caused by obesity, in the absence of alcohol
consumption.) Fatty liver doesn’t cause pain, although some tenderness
in the liver can occur.

Chapter 9: Digestive and Urinary Conditions

 Regular binge drinking, or episodes of rapidly consuming five or more
drinks for men or four or more drinks in women, can cause alcoholic
hepatitis, which is often a precursor to the development of cirrhosis.
Limit your alcohol consumption to one or two drinks only, once in
awhile, and your liver will thank you! Alcoholic hepatitis can cause pain
as well as fatigue, fever, and other symptoms.
 Cirrhosis is the most serious alcohol-related conditions. It’s the massive
loss of healthy liver cells and a buildup of scar tissue, which disturbs the
blood flow. Cirrhosis causes pain and other symptoms, such as bleeding
in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
The liver is enflamed and enlarged in all three conditions.
You can reverse fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis by no longer consuming
any alcohol. Cirrhosis isn’t reversible, but can be arrested. (Read more about
alcoholism in Chapter 14.)
Not all heavy drinkers develop alcohol liver disease, but it’s impossible to tell
who will get it and, for those who do, how severe the symptoms will be.
Sobriety (total abstinence from alcohol) is crucial to recovery from alcoholic
liver disease. In addition, doctors usually prescribe nutritional fortification
and vitamin supplementation, because many people with alcohol liver dis-
ease may have vitamin deficiencies. In addition, corticosteroids are pre-
scribed to decrease inflammation.
Celiac disease
Celiac disease is the body’s inability to absorb nutrients, which is related to
its inability to digest gluten. (Glutens are proteins found in commonly eaten
grains, including wheat, rye, oats, and barley.)
The condition may strike at any age, including infancy. Many people have celiac
disease, but they don’t know it. Most adults diagnosed with celiac disease have
had it for ten years or longer before finally receiving an accurate diagnosis. (It’s
not that doctors are stupid, but rather that it’s a tough disease to diagnose.)
Painful signs of celiac disease are chronic diarrhea, dyspepsia, gas, and a dis-
tended stomach. If you have celiac disease, you may be constantly
exhausted, be depressed, and develop anemia or osteoporosis. Children with
celiac disease may have a delayed puberty and even suffer from neurological
symptoms, such as epilepsy. People of all ages who have celiac disease may
develop a rash called dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). This skin condition is
small clusters of red bumps that are extremely itchy. The clusters appear
around the elbows, knees, scalp, buttocks, and back.
108
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

The good news is that removing gluten from your diet makes the condition go
away and lets your aching intestines heal. The bad news is that getting rid of
gluten isn’t easy. Gluten hides in many products and restaurant foods. If you
want to eliminate gluten altogether from your diet, you’ll need to become a
strict reader of food labels and an inquisitive customer in restaurants.
Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease is an inflammation of the wall of the intestine and causes
chronic pain. Crohn’s usually strikes during the teen years and early 20s.
People who smoke have an increased risk for developing this disease. Crohn’s
is diagnosed by a colonoscopy, in which an optic tube with a tiny camera
attached to it is inserted into the body through the rectum to examine the
digestive tract.
Some common symptoms of Crohn’s disease are
 Chronic diarrhea
 Bloody diarrhea
 Bleeding from the rectum
 Abdominal pain
 Fever
 Loss of appetite
 Dehydration
 Weight loss
As with other chronic inflammatory diseases, the symptoms of Crohn’s dis-
ease may subside, but they come back again later. Crohn’s can scar the wall
of the intestines, leading to blockage and ulcers. Tunnels, called fistulas, can
develop and interconnect an affected area of intestine with surrounding tis-
sues, such as the bladder, vagina, or skin. Fistulas and cracks may also
develop around the anus.
Treatment of Crohn’s disease is focused on improving symptoms and control-
ling the disease process. People with Crohn’s should never smoke cigarettes
because smoking is a risk factor for Crohn’s, and if you already have the dis-
ease, smoking increases the pain. Lactose intolerance is common for people
with Crohn’s, so dairy products should be limited in the diet if you’re lactose-
intolerant in addition to having Crohn’s. (Read about lactose intolerance in
the section called “Lactose intolerance,” later in this chapter.)
The treatment for Crohn’s depends on how severe the disease is and can
include drug therapy, nutritional therapy, and surgery. Over half of those with
Crohn’s eventually require at least one surgical procedure.
109
Chapter 9: Digestive and Urinary Conditions

Dyspepsia
Dyspepsia is discomfort in the upper abdomen. The condition can overlap
with peptic ulcers and GERD. (Both conditions are covered in the “Peptic
ulcers” and “GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease” sections later in this
chapter.) Often the cause of dyspepsia is unknown.
This condition is very common, and at least one in four people have dyspepsia.
You may feel fullness in the top part of your stomach or feel full after eating
just a small amount of food. You also may have bloating, burping, nausea,
gagging, and/or vomiting. (It’s bad enough that you’re feeling the discomfort
of dyspepsia, but if others notice you’re burping and gagging, you may also
feel embarrassed.)
If you have chronic dyspepsia, limit or eliminate alcohol, caffeine, and fatty
foods from your diet. Keeping a food diary to identify symptoms is helpful.
(See Chapter 18 for information on a food diary.) Your doctor may also pre-
scribe medicines called antisecretory therapies or proton pump inhibitors.
GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease
After you swallow food, it travels down the esophagus and empties into your
stomach. At the bottom of the esophagus is a muscle that acts as a door.
When it becomes weak and doesn’t close all the way, the acidic contents of
your stomach may back up, sneaking through the door, entering the esopha-
gus and irritating it. (This process is referred to as reflux, and the disease is
called gastroesophageal reflux disease, sometimes also known as heartburn.)
People of all ages can have GERD, including babies whose esophageal muscle
has not matured. One in five adults report that they have symptoms of GERD
at least once a week. As many as one in ten have symptoms every day.
The most common symptoms of GERD are heartburn and indigestion. 
Other symptoms may include cough, hoarseness, and wheezing. When
untreated, GERD can cause esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus), 
narrowing of the esophagus, and a precancerous condition called Barrett’s
esophagus.
If you have GERD, you can control symptoms by following recommendations
from the National Institutes of Health:
 Avoid alcohol and spicy, fatty, or acidic foods that trigger heartburn.
 Eat smaller meals.
110
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

 Don’t eat within two hours of bedtime.
 Lose weight if needed.
 Wear loose-fitting clothes. Maybe you were a size 12 ten years ago, and
now you’re a size 16. Wear your actual size — until you get it back down
to a size 14 (or 12) again.
Many people find relief from GERD by taking over-the-counter antacids. But if
you’re popping antacids all day, every day, you have chronic GERD (or
another serious problem), and you should see your doctor.
Additional techniques that can help are elevating the head of your bed by 6
inches, and staying away from caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and, sadly, chocolate.
When you have GERD, you should also avoid grapefruit and orange juice, beans,
cheese, onions, tomatoes, and cabbage.
Some drugs, especially anticholinergics, can lead to GERD. Ask your doctor
whether you can take a lower dosage of the drug.
Peptic ulcers
A peptic ulcer is a break in the lining (called the mucosa) of the stomach or
duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Peptic ulcers occur five times
more commonly in the duodenum than the stomach. Ulcers range in size
from a few millimeters to a few centimeters.
One in ten people develop peptic ulcers, and men are slightly more likely to
have them than women. Contrary to myth, drinking alcohol, a bad diet, and
excessive stress don’t cause ulcers (although they can each make the pain
from existing ulcers much worse).
Instead, the two major causes of peptic ulcers are
 Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori): H. pylori are bacteria that many people
unknowingly carry around in their stomachs and duodenums. In fact, 
50 percent of Americans over age 60 have the bacteria in their gastroin-
testinal systems, and most of them don’t develop ulcers. Why they
escape the pain of ulcers and others do not is unknown.
 The heavy use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You
can find more information on these drugs in Chapter 14. People who
take NSAIDs for a long time have a 10 to 20 percent chance that 
they’ll develop ulcers in the stomach and a 1 to 2 percent chance that they
will develop them in their duodenum. Incredibly, the risk of a gastric
ulcer is 40 times higher if you take NSAIDs on a long-term basis compared
to a person who doesn’t take them. People who have H. pylori and also
take NSAIDS are at an even greater risk for developing ulcers. (See
Chapter 14 for information on NSAIDs.)
111
Chapter 9: Digestive and Urinary Conditions

Pain and indigestion are the main signs of peptic ulcers. The symptoms are
often relieved by eating.
Ulcer pain comes and goes, often with eating cycles. If the pain is constant, it
means that the ulcer has broken through the lining of the stomach or duodenum,
which can cause the stomach or intestinal contents to flow into the abdominal
cavity. In addition, it can cause inflammation of the lining of the stomach wall
(peritonitis). Both problems can cause infection and are medical emergencies.
See your doctor!
Treatment for peptic ulcers varies depending on the cause of the condition:
 H. pylori: The goal with treating ulcers caused by H. pylori is to relieve
the painful symptoms, stop the infection, and heal the break. Your doctor
will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria and proton pump inhibitors to
calm the stomach or small intestine. (Proton pump inhibitors are a group of
drugs that reduce gastric acid production.)
 NSAIDs: If you must take NSAIDs to relieve pain and inflammation, treating
your ulcers may be difficult. Your doctor may advise you to take a proton
pump inhibitor on a daily basis as long as you continue to take NSAIDs.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic problem of the large intestine that
causes stomach pain and changes in bowel habits. Symptoms of IBS wax and
wane, and sometimes it’s not too bad and other times — bad!
The condition is common, and women are more likely to have IBS than men.
Symptoms include constipation or diarrhea, and (this is truly maddening) some
patients alternate between constipation and diarrhea. Bloating is also common.
The cause of IBS is not known, although hormones may play a role. Your doctor
will probably run tests to make sure that you don’t have another disease causing
the symptoms.
If you have IBS, you can control your symptoms with diet, stress reduction,
adjusting your medicines, and, when appropriate, taking specific drugs pre-
scribed by your doctor. Symptom and food diaries are great tools for identify-
ing food triggers. Trouble digesting dairy products (lactose intolerance) may
also be a problem.
For many people with IBS, fatty foods and caffeine are the culprits triggering
their symptoms. Other possible food triggers are fruit sugars, sorbitol (used
in artificially sweetened foods), and foods that produce gas, such as brown
beans and cabbage.
112
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

Lactose intolerance
People with lactose intolerance can’t digest a sugar in dairy products that’s
called lactose. Their bodies don’t produce enough lactase, an enzyme that
digests lactose. That means no more ice cream, whipped cream, or milk.
(However, sufferers may be able to consume a small amount of a product
with lactose if they take an over-the-counter medication, such as Lactaid.)
The condition is common in people of non-European ancestry, particularly
Asians, Native Americans, or African-Americans, and its incidence increases with
age. Estimates are that 50 million people in the United States have partial to com-
plete lactose intolerance. People with other conditions, such as Crohn’s disease
and a tropical disease called Sprue, may also develop lactose intolerance.
If you’re lactose intolerant, you probably have some combination of chronic
diarrhea, bloating, cramping, and gas if you regularly eat and/or drink dairy
products. Quantity matters when it comes to lactose intolerance. Most people
with lactose intolerance can drink one or two glasses of milk at different meals
in one day, but if they exceed that amount, then they have symptoms.
If you have symptoms of lactose intolerance, your doctor will probably first
recommend eliminating cow’s milk from your diet to see whether they go
away. If you give up cow’s milk and your symptoms improve, but you would
like additional confirmation, three types of tests are used most frequently:
the lactose tolerance, hydrogen breath, and stool acidity tests.
Dairy products are so prominent in American diets that it’s worth experi-
menting to find the amount of dairy you can actually eat or drink before
symptoms begin. Always tell a new doctor that you’re lactose-intolerant so
that she can keep that in mind when prescribing drugs. (Lactose is used as a
filler in many drugs, such as some brands of birth control pills and antacids,
and certain antibiotics and other medications can inhibit lactose absorption.)
Use the food diary, described in Chapter 18, to help you discover whether
you may be lactose-intolerant. Your physician may order blood or breath
tests to verify that you have a problem.
Foods high in lactose include milk, ice cream, and cottage cheese. (Who
cares about the cottage cheese, but ice cream is tough to give up!) Aged
cheeses, such as Parmesan, have a lower lactose content than fresher cheeses.
Unpasteurized yogurt contains bacteria that produce lactase and, as a result is
usually okay to eat if you’re lactose-intolerant.
If you eliminate dairy from your diet, take calcium supplements to prevent
osteoporosis.
113
Chapter 9: Digestive and Urinary Conditions

You can find milk pretreated with lactase in most grocery stores. However,
lactase-treated milk sometimes still has some lactose in it, so be cautious
about how much you drink at one time. Lactase enzyme replacement is also
available commercially (Lactaid).
Pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that doesn’t go away.
A gland behind the stomach, the pancreas plays an important role in digest-
ing food and metabolizing carbohydrates. Heavy drinkers of alcohol and/or
people who smoke cigarettes are the most likely to develop pancreatitis.
If you have pancreatitis, you’re likely to have pain, loss of appetite, nausea,
vomiting, constipation, gas, and weight loss. During flares, you’ll feel tender-
ness over the pancreas. Attacks can last as long as two weeks, but some pain
may be constant.
If you have chronic pancreatitis, you must eat a low-fat diet and eliminate
alcohol and narcotics. Doctors prescribe drugs that specifically treat the 
condition.
Interstitial cystitis (IC)
A chronically inflamed bladder that causes major pain is called interstitial cys-
titis (IC). This condition is also known as painful bladder syndrome (PBS).
Both men and women develop IC, but it’s more common in women. The average
age of people with IC is 40. IC may be caused by several diseases and is associ-
ated with allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease.
IC causes pain when the bladder fills up and also causes the urgent need to
urinate. IC may cause difficulty in controlling the flow of urine. The person with
IC may constantly feel like she has a bladder infection. In fact, some doctors
give antibiotics to people with such chronic bladder pain, but antibiotics don’t
help unless the person really does have an infection.
IC has no cure, but treatments are available to control symptoms. For exam-
ple, if you have IC, you should avoid smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol,
and eating spicy foods. Medical treatment includes inflating the bladder and
bathing the inside of the bladder with a medicine called dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), which is approved by the FDA to treat this condition. Oral medica-
tions may also be used to control bladder spasms. Consult an urologist who
specializes in IC if you think you may have this disorder.
Advanced treatments for IC include implanting a sacral nerve stimulator
device. The device is a reversible treatment that sends mild electrical 
114
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

pulses to the sacral nerve, the nerve near the tailbone that influences bladder
control muscles.
Urethritis
Chronic urethritis is an ongoing inflammation of the urethra that can strike both
women and men. (The urethra is the canal that eliminates urine from the body.) It
may be caused by injury, bacteria, a virus, or sensitivity to chemicals. People
who are sexually active with many partners are particularly at risk for urethritis.
Symptoms of chronic urethritis for men include a discharge from the penis, itch-
ing or pain when urinating, and blood in the urine. Women experience pain while
urinating, an increased need to urinate, and a vaginal discharge. Antibiotics are
frequently prescribed along with painkillers for chronic urethritis.
Practicing safe sex is extremely important to prevent spreading the infection
and potentially causing urethritis in others. Often, your sexual partner must
also be treated. If the condition is made worse by chemicals, such as spermi-
cides, stop using them.
Chronic urethritis can cause permanent damage to the urethra and genitouri-
nary organs in both sexes.
Diagnosing Digestive and 
Urinary Conditions
Each type of chronic digestive or urinary condition has its own set of diagnostic
criteria. To diagnose and treat these problems, your primary care physician
may refer you to a physician who specializes in digestive or urinary health. In
addition, the following organizations can help you locate a specialist:

T
he amazing reproductive systems of a man and woman together can create
new life — what can be more remarkable than that? But from raging hor-
mones to enlarged prostates, your reproductive system can also be the source
of many chronic pain problems. In this chapter, we tell you what you need to
know to understand the tie between chronic pain and the reproductive system.
Understanding Your 
Reproductive Systems
Most of the time, the reproductive system works fine. But sometimes something
goes wrong, causing chronic pain for a man or woman. Fortunately, treatments
are available for most chronic pain conditions in the reproductive system.
As you can see from Figure 10-1, the female reproductive system is much more
complex than the male system. While the female reproductive system is deep
inside the woman’s body, most of the male reproductive system is external
and accessible, such as the penis and the scrotum, the sac that contains the
testicles. The result of these differences in anatomy means that reproductive
conditions in women are much more difficult to diagnose and treat than those
in men. For this reason, we spend much more time in this chapter discussing
women’s reproductive conditions than we do discussing men’s problems.

118
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
For Women Only: Problems in 
the Reproductive System
Women’s reproductive systems give them a lot of practice with handling pain.
Monthly cramps and, for many, childbirth, go together with being female.
Unfortunately, some chronic pain conditions can also strike women. The
most common chronic painful conditions of the female reproductive system
are endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and premenstrual syn-
drome. The onset and the early stages of menopause can cause considerable
distress as well.
Endometriosis
The endometrium is the lining of the uterus (the part of the body that babies
grow inside). About 12 times a year, the uterine lining builds up in preparation
for a fetus, and then it sloughs off during menstruation when no pregnancy
occurs. Most women refer to this monthly cycle as “my period.”

Some unhappy women have a problem in which the rogue endometrium some-
how escapes outside the uterus, hiding out in other parts of their bodies, such
as the bladder or ovaries. This escapee tissue actually goes through the men-
strual cycle in its new location, the same as it would have if it had remained
where it was supposed to be, in the uterus. Stuck in its new location and with
no way out, the endometrium becomes inflamed, and it can develop cysts and
create other problems, a condition called endometriosis. Figure 10-2 shows
common areas in the female anatomy where endometriosis occurs.
Endometriosis causes aching in the abdomen, lower back, and/or rectum.
The pain may migrate to the vagina or upper legs. If you have this condition,
you’ll probably start to feel pain two to seven days before your period, and it
will become increasingly severe until your period stops. You may also experi-
ence bleeding from the rectum. As the disease progresses, the pain may
become constant and unremitting. Infertility is also common for women with
endometriosis.
Six to 10 percent of women in the United States suffer from the chronic pain
of endometriosis, and it’s four or five times more likely to strike infertile than
fertile women.

Chapter 10: Reproductive Conditions

Treatment may include hormone therapy, prescribed painkillers, and, in
severe cases, surgically removing affected tissues. For women who want to
become pregnant, surgery can greatly improve their chances.
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a painful infection of the upper genital
tract that’s caused by a variety of sexually transmitted organisms, including
the ones that cause gonorrhea and chlamydia. It’s a serious disease that can
damage the fallopian tubes, causing infertility. PID can also become a chronic
pain problem for some women. (PID is also called salpingitis.)
Pelvic inflammatory disease is most common among young, sexually active
women who’ve never given birth and who have had multiple sexual partners.
Nonwhite race, douching, and smoking are also factors associated with PID.
The use of birth control pills or barrier contraceptives (such as the cervical
cap or diaphragm) may protect against PID. However, use of an intrauterine
device (IUD) is a risk factor for developing PID.
If you’ve had sex with a partner who may have a sexually transmitted disease
(STD), see your doctor right away. She can help you treat most infections
that you may be developing.
Symptoms of PID are lower abdominal pain, chills, fever, irregular periods, a
yellow or green vaginal discharge, and pain during intercourse. On a scale of 1
to 10, many women will say that PID pain is about a 200.
Early treatment with antibiotics is important for the person with PID and her
sexual partner(s). Treatment with antibiotics in a hospital and/or surgery
may be necessary.
Premenstrual Syndrome
Ask most women the definition of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), and they’ll
say, “That’s easy. PMS is hell.” Scientifically speaking, however, PMS is actu-
ally a group of painful physical and emotional symptoms that develop during
the 7 to 14 days before the onset of a menstrual period and that go away
when menstruation occurs.
PMS symptoms differ from woman to woman. Also, if you have PMS, your
own symptoms may change with each period. Common problems are
 Bloating
 Acne
 Painful breasts
120
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

 Weight gain
 Skin disorders
 Irritability and/anger
 Depression
 Inability to concentrate
 Mood swings
 Lack of interest in sex
 Lethargy
 Cravings for carbohydrates
We know what you are thinking: “Sure! Every woman has some of these symp-
toms before a period.” Well, if you have PMS, these symptoms are severe.
You’re not just a bit of a fuzz-head; you truly can’t think straight! You’re not
just yawning a little; you take to bed at any opportunity. You get the idea!
The condition attacks about two in five women, which is a lot of women! For
most women with PMS, the condition is a chronic pain problem.
Sadly, little research has been done on how to treat PMS. Many experts rec-
ommend that women participate in aerobic exercise, reduce their caffeine,
salt, and alcohol intake, and eat complex carbohydrates, such as vegetables.
Your doctor may also prescribe a diuretic to help with bloating and tender
breasts and may order hormones to decrease breast pain and cramping.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help ease painful cramps.
Many women also find that taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) antidepressant can stabilize the mood swings that PMS can cause.
Soaking in a warm bath can help ease painful cramps considerably.
Menopause
Menopause is the winding down of female reproduction. Your body produces
less and less estrogen, and then menstruation finally ends altogether, either
due to aging or the surgical removal of both ovaries. When periods have
stopped for one year, menopause is officially diagnosed.
The average age at menopause is 51 years. If menopause occurs before age 40,
it’s considered premature.
The process of menopause usually takes one to three years, with accompanying
physical symptoms, but symptoms such as night sweats, hot flashes, and
irritability can go on for many years.
121
Chapter 10: Reproductive Conditions

Vaginal bleeding that occurs after your periods have completely stopped for
a year or more isn’t normal. See your doctor to make sure that you don’t
have a medical problem.
Four in five menopausal women get hot flashes during menopause (feelings of
intense heat, flushing and sweating). Hot flashes are particularly troublesome
for women who have a surgical menopause. Other painful symptoms of
menopause include
 Thinning and drying of the vagina
 Atrophy of the bladder
 Anxiety
 Mood swings
 Lethargy
 Osteoporosis
For many years, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was frequently pre-
scribed for menopause symptoms. However, taking hormones is now consid-
ered controversial and may even put you at risk for breast cancer. The
decision for or against hormones is a personal one, and it’s important to talk
this issue over with your gynecologist.
Other treatments for menopause include estrogen creams for vaginal dry-
ness, vaginal rings with estrogen, and antidepressants. Consuming estrogen-
containing foods, such as pomegranates, rice, and barley, may help.
For Men Only: Problems in 
the Reproductive System
Reproductive problems for men are often linked to sexual activity or the
aging process. Sometimes they’re caused by infections, as with prostatitis
(inflammation of the prostate).
For example, prostate problems are very common after age 50. And the older
men get, the more likely they are to have such problems. Prostate cancer is
diagnosed in many men, and, after lung cancer, it’s the most commonly
occurring form of cancer for men.
The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that is part of a man’s reproductive system.
The gland tends to expand with age and may squeeze the urethra, which carries
urine away from your bladder. (The prostate surrounds the urethra.) Several
prostate problems can develop:
122
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

 Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infection of the prostate caused by bacteria.
Symptoms include chills, fever, and pain in the lower back and genital
area. Problems with urination are also common. Bacterial prostatitis can
become chronic.
 Chronic prostatitis is the most common type of prostatitis, and it’s a
common infection that can strike men of any age. The condition comes
and goes and is difficult to treat.
 Enlarged prostates, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), are common in
older men. Over time, an enlarged prostate may press against the ure-
thra, making it hard to urinate. Dribbling and urgency can occur. A
doctor does a rectal exam to check for BPH.
Many men try to avoid the rectal examination during their annual physical
exam because it’s so embarrassing. Don’t be one of them! The rectal exam
that your doctor performs can detect serious problems with the prostate,
such as BPH, prostatitis, or even prostate cancer.
Antibiotics are used to treat acute bacterial prostatitis, but they will not help
chronic prostatitis. For chronic prostatitis, doctors sometimes prescribe
medicines to relax the gland. Other medicines used for BPH are alpha-block-
ers or finasteride, a medicine that lowers the testosterone level. However,
taking finasteride can also dampen a man’s libido and hamper his sexual
performance. (Understandably, most men aren’t very enthusiastic about these
side effects.) Sometimes surgery is necessary to relieve BPH symptoms.
Diagnosing Pain Problems: 
Who Can Help
Each cause of reproductive pain has its own set of diagnostic criteria. To
diagnose and treat these problems, your primary care physician may refer
you to a physician who specializes in reproductive health. For women, this
person is usually a gynecologist, and for men, it’s usually an urologist.

M
ore than 15 million people in the United States suffer from nerve pain,
called neuralgias and neuropathies. These conditions differ greatly in
symptoms and treatments.
In this chapter, you find out more information about the different types of
nerve conditions and chronic nerve pain.
Understanding Your Network of Nerves
Your body’s network of nerves, called the peripheral nervous system, relays
messages back and forth between your central nervous system (your brain
and spinal cord) and the rest of your body. The network is stunningly intricate
and complicated, which is probably because it has a really important job. It’s
responsible for everything from helping you move from point A to point B, to
enabling you to feel sensations of pain and hot and cold temperatures, as well
as the touch of a loved one’s hand. It also helps maintain your heartbeat,
digestion, and other vital body functions. (For more on the peripheral nervous
system, see Chapter 2.)
You can injure the peripheral network and its nerve messengers in a number
of ways — for example through an accident or as a result of diseases, such as
diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Even treatments for some diseases —
such as chemotherapy for cancer — can injure your nerves. If such damage

occurs, some of your nerves may stop working altogether. Or they may go
haywire on you and send mixed-up pain messages. For example, if you’ve dam-
aged nerves, instead of feeling major pain when your neighbor’s 120-pound
dog leaps joyfully on your foot, you may feel merely a tingling sensation. On
the other hand, nerve damage may make you so exquisitely sensitive to touch
that even putting a cotton sock on your foot can cause excruciating pain.
The different types of nerve pain are associated with constant or recurring
pain that doesn’t get better. However, the type of pain that is experienced can
vary. It can be a feeling that’s like burning, numbness, tingling, a stabbing sen-
sation, or feeling like pins and needles are pricking you, or feeling like you’re
receiving an electric shock.
Considering Complex Regional 
Pain Syndrome (CRPS)
Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition of the arm, hand,
leg, or foot. The major symptom is intense pain out of all proportion to the
type of injury that initially set it off. CRPS frequently develops in the hand,
along with restriction of shoulder motion on that same side of the body (called
shoulder-hand syndrome). (See Chapter 7 for more information about CRPS.)
CRPS causes burning pain, sweating, swelling, and disturbances of color and
temperature in the affected area, which is often blotchy, purple, pale, or red.
It also causes shiny and thin skin, stiffness in the affected joints, weakness
and wasting of muscles, changes in the overlying skin and nails, and a limited
range of motion. Not a pretty picture.
Unhappily, the pain and other symptoms of CRPS worsen over time. The sym-
pathetic nervous system may be the culprit in maintaining the pain. (See
Chapter 2 for information on the sympathetic nervous system.) Often, CRPS
is set off by an injury, even a minor one. Mere bug bites can trigger the condi-
tion! Sometimes the cause isn’t known.
CRPS may develop in three typical stages.
 Stage I can last about three months. You may feel a burning pain, stiffness
in your joints, sweating, and warmth in the affected area. Other (rather odd)
symptoms may include fast-growing nails and hair, thin and dry skin,
and blotchy, purple, pale, or red skin color.
 Stage II typically follows and can last for a year. Swelling increases,
and your skin in the affected area cools and becomes extremely sensitive
to touch. Even the touch of a bed sheet can cause excruciating pain. The
pain also typically becomes diffuse, and you may feel stiff.
126
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

 Stage III is the last stage. At this point, alas, the condition is permanent.
The pain may cover your entire limb. Your joints may be very stiff.
If it’s caught and treated in time, you can keep CRPS in a holding pattern and
prevent it from ever advancing any further than Stage 1.
Physical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for CRPS, and the priority is
to restore your function and keep your body from becoming any weaker due to
immobility. For tough cases, prednisone, a steroid medication, may help you
considerably.
Sympathetic nerve blocks and a procedure called spinal cord stimulation, in
which an electrode inside the spine elicits low-dosage impulses, also helps
some people with CRPS.
Getting on Your Nerves: 
Peripheral Neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy is well-named. Peripheral means beyond (in this case,
away from the brain and the spinal cord and out into the body). Neuro means
nerves, and pathy means disease. So, peripheral neuropathy describes condi-
tions caused by damage to the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord
to the rest of the body (the peripheral nervous system).
Peripheral neuropathy has many causes. It occurs most commonly in people
with diabetes mellitus and those who abuse or are dependent on alcohol.
Suffering the symptoms
The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy depend on which nerve or nerves
are damaged. The following list of symptoms is adapted from information
from the National Institutes of Health.
Sensation changes
Damage to sensory nerves can cause nerve pain, sensations of tingling or
numbness, or an inability to determine your joint position, which, in turn,
causes a lack of coordination. For many neuropathies, the symptoms begin in
the feet and then move toward the center of the body.
Movement difficulties
Damage to motor nerves interferes with muscle control and can cause weak-
ness, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of dexterity. Other muscle-related symp-
toms may include
127
Chapter 11: Following the Nerve Pathways: Neuralgias and Neuropathies

 Cramps
 Lack of muscle control
 Difficulty or inability to move a part of the body (paralysis)
 Muscle atrophy
 Muscle twitching
 Difficulty breathing or swallowing
 Falling (from legs buckling or tripping over your own toes)
 Lack of dexterity (such as being unable to button a shirt)
Autonomic symptoms
The autonomic nerves control your involuntary or semivoluntary functions,
such as the control of your internal organs and your blood pressure. Damage
to autonomic nerves can cause many symptoms and signs, including
 Blurred vision
 Decreased ability to sweat
 Dizziness that occurs when standing up or fainting that’s associated
with a drop in blood pressure
 Heat intolerance with exertion (decreased ability to regulate body
temperature)
 Nausea or vomiting after meals
 Stomach bloating
 Feeling full after eating a small amount (early satiety)
 Diarrhea or constipation
 Unintentional weight loss
 Urinary incontinence
 Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying
 Difficulty with starting to urinate (urinary hesitancy)
 Male impotence
Tagging the types
Peripheral neuropathies are common, especially among older people, and can
cause both acute and chronic pain problems. More than a hundred different
types of peripheral neuropathy exist, with many different causes. For example,
Bell’s palsy can be caused by a facial nerve becoming swollen or inflamed. It
128
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

causes paralysis or weakness on one side of the face. Peripheral neuropathies
are classified according to their symptoms and cause.
Anyone who suffers from nerve problems (or who loves someone who does)
needs to know these two terms:
 Polyneuropathies, which are what most neuropathies are, occur when
more than one peripheral nerve stops working or goes haywire at once,
causing weakness and/or pain. Many conditions can cause polyneu-
ropathies, including diabetes, cancer, and other diseases. Often,
polyneuropathy affects the same nerves on both sides of the body, and
frequently the problem begins in the legs. Polyneuropathy can affect the
sensory, motor, and autonomic systems. Polyneuropathies in all these
systems can occur together at one time. Polyneuropathies tend to progress
slowly and become chronic over months and years.
 Mononeuropathy refers to damage to only one nerve. Individual nerves
are injured or crowded out, compressed, or stretched by organs, discs,
and other anatomic structures, especially if the nerve passes through a
narrow space (called entrapment neuropathy). The symptoms that occur
depend on the nerve that’s involved. Mononeuropathies have many
causes, including
• Physical injury or trauma of a nerve caused by an accident
• Long-lasting pressure on a nerve, caused by inactivity, such as
when you’re confined to a wheelchair or bed
• Overuse of structures surrounding a nerve through such actions as
typing, running a checkout stand, or other repetitive motions (for
example, carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by compression of the
nerve that extends through the wrist)
• Damage to a disc in the spine, which causes pressure on a nerve
Nerves come in different varieties, depending on whether they’re motor,
autonomic, sensory, or mixed nerves (with sensory, motor and autonomic
components). A mononeuropathy can involve one or all of the following:
• Damage to a nerve that controls muscle movement (motor
nerves), causing reduction of strength and dexterity
• Damage to a sensory nerve, which detects sensations, such as cold
or pain
• Damage to a nerve that affects the heart, blood vessels, bladder,
intestines, or other internal organs (autonomic neuropathy)
• Mononeuropathy multiplex, when several isolated nerves are
injured at once
129
Chapter 11: Following the Nerve Pathways: Neuralgias and Neuropathies

If you have peripheral neuropathy, you’re at risk for additional nerve injury at
your body’s pressure points. Avoid putting weight on these areas for long
periods of time; for example, don’t lean on your elbows or sit in one position
for lengthy periods.
If you have chronic polyneuropathy, you can lose your ability to sense tem-
perature and pain. As a result, you can severely burn yourself and not even
know it. You can also develop open sores and calluses, especially on your
feet, as the result of injury or prolonged pressure. Visually check your body,
especially your feet, at least every day. Wear socks and don’t go barefoot in
or out of the house. Be sure to check between your toes. In addition, keep
your feet clean and dry to prevent calluses and sores from developing. You
should also look inside your shoes a few times each day to discover rocks or
any other objects that may rub against your feet and cause sores.
To guard against burns, check the temperature of the water before you take a
bath or shower. Measure the water temperature with a thermometer and
make sure that the temperature setting of your hot-water heater is not set
above 125° F (52°C). Also, use a part of your body that has normal sensation
(such as your elbow) to check for hot surfaces.
Preventing peripheral neuropathies
Some causes of neuropathy are under your control. For example, if you have
diabetes, controlling your blood sugar level is extremely important to pre-
vent the death of nerve fibers. If you or a loved one drinks a lot of alcohol, do
everything you can now to beat this dependence. Or, if you’re being treated
with chemotherapy, ask your doctor to prescribe one of the new medicines

available to prevent nerve damage. Ask about one of the drugs presently
being developed that includes neuroprotective and neurotrophic agents (also
called nerve growth factors).
Eating a diet high in B vitamins (in meats, fish, eggs, low-fat dairy foods, and
fortified cereals) is also preventive for neuropathy.
131
Chapter 11: Following the Nerve Pathways: Neuralgias and Neuropathies
Major types of polyneuropathy
Many different types of polyneuropathies can
cause chronic pain, including these key ones:
 Diabetes-related polyneuropathy has the
dubious distinction of being the most
common form of peripheral neuropathy. In
this condition, high blood sugar levels of
uncontrolled diabetes slowly destroy nerve
cells. About 50 percent of people with dia-
betes develop peripheral neuropathy.
 Nutritional polyneuropathy is common
among people who are malnourished or
alcoholic. The cause is usually a lack of 
B vitamins, especially B1, B12, and folic
acid. Poor diet, digestive problems, and
long-term use of some medications can
cause vitamin deficiencies. Alcoholism also
depletes the body of B vitamins.
 Rheumatoid arthritis can cause a number of
painful nerve conditions, such as entrapment
neuropathies, which are caused by chronic
compression of a nerve in a narrow space.
 Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused by
toxic effects of heavy long-term drink-
ing. The condition can be hard to distin-
guish from nutrition-related neuropathies
because of the loss of B vitamins that
comes with heavy drinking. People who’ve
been alcoholic for 10 years or more are at
high risk for alcoholic polyneuropathy.
 Polyneuropathy due to cancer and cancer
treatments strike many people. In fact,
some chemotherapies used for cancer
treatments can damage peripheral nerves.
 Polyneuropathies caused by inherited dis-
orders are rare, but occur. Examples are:
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a
group of disorders that affect peripheral
nerves (named after the scientists who dis-
covered it), and amyloid polyneuropathy, a
progressive condition of the sensory and
motor systems.
 Toxic neuropathies are caused by expo-
sure to industrial agents or pesticides, such
as acrylamide and carbon disulfide, or to
metals, such as arsenic and lead. They can
also be caused by drugs such as phenytoin
(Dilantin), used for epilepsy, and isoniazid,
used for tuberculosis.
 Guillain-Barre syndrome is caused by the
body’s immune system attacking nerves in
the body. The condition can lead to paralysis.
In addition to these conditions, diseases of the
kidneys, thyroid, and liver, as well as infections
can cause polyneuropathies.

Treating peripheral neuropathies
Treatment for peripheral neuropathies begins with identifying and treating
the condition causing the problem (such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes)
or getting rid of the cause (such as consuming too much alcohol or overexpo-
sure to lead). If this first approach is successful, the neuropathy may get
better, and painful symptoms may go away. If painful symptoms won’t budge,
the next steps are to relieve them as much as possible and prevent immobil-
ity and deconditioning. A number of treatment choices are available, and a
combination of several approaches may be most successful.
You can use many types of medications to relieve the pain of peripheral neu-
ropathy. You can treat milder pain with over-the-counter drugs, such as
acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin. Stronger pain may require prescription
pain medications, such as codeine, Demerol, or morphine. For electric-like
pain, doctors also prescribe anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine
(Tegretol) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), are also
used. Some people find that capsaicin cream (Zostrix), the substance found
in hot peppers, or the topical numbing cream, lidocaine, to be helpful.
Lidocaine is also available in a prescribed patch (Lidoderm).
If you have peripheral neuropathy, you need to know that both physical and
occupational therapy are important to build muscle strength and control, and
prevent deconditioning. If the neuropathy is severe, wheelchairs, splints, 
and other assistive devices may be necessary to help you maintain your basic
functions and carry out daily activities. Many people use special frames to
keep their bedclothes from touching tender areas.
Pain in the Face: Trigeminal Neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is nerve pain in the cheekbone area, where the
trigeminal nerve is located. Your trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensa-
tions on your face, and it’s the motor nerve controlling the muscles you use
to chew. If you develop trigeminal neuralgia (also called tic douloureux), you’ll
experience episodes of sudden and sharp facial pain.
TN usually strikes near one side of the mouth and shoots toward the ear, eye,
or nostril on the same side. Episodes last from two seconds to two minutes.
Some people can have a hundred episodes a day. People with TN often
describe the pain as intense and excruciating.
Unfortunately, TN episodes can worsen over time, and the time between the
attacks shortens. In addition, a dull ache or burning may occur between
episodes. Symptoms are confined to tissues innervated by the trigeminal
nerve, running on one side of the face only.
132
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

The pain may be triggered by such seemingly innocuous things as a light
touch on the skin, mild breezes (which most people enjoy), as well as by
everyday acts, such as talking and eating. In order to prevent attacks, many
people hold their faces as immobile and expressionless as possible while
talking and eating. If you talk to someone with TN who seems emotionless, he
is probably trying to prevent the pain by using inscrutable expressions.
Bouts of TN can stop for several months or longer. But the bad news is that
they come back, sometimes with a vengeance.
TN most commonly occurs in middle and later life, but it can occur in all
ages. TN affects women more often than men. Often the cause of TN is diffi-
cult to detect. Sometimes it’s caused by multiple sclerosis, a tumor, or an
aneurysm pressing on a nerve.
In the recent past, doctors tried to eliminate the pain of TN with techniques
such as injecting the trigeminal nerve with alcohol or a procedure called bal-
loon rhizotomy, which destroys the affected part of the nerve.
Recently, surgeons have successfully relieved pressure on the trigeminal
nerve by separating blood vessels from it. However, if you or a loved one is
elderly, a procedure called radiofrequency rhizotomy is still the preferred pro-
cedure because recovery is easier.
Gamma radiosurgery, a nonivasive procedure that uses beams of radiation to
the trigeminal root, successfully treats TN in 4 out of 5 people.
Anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol) and phenytoin (Dilantin),
are used to treat TN. Other drugs used to treat TN include antidepressants,
muscles relaxants, and opioids.

Postherpetic Neuralgia
Until a vaccine for chicken pox first became available in 1995, most children
suffered from the infection, which also made some of them vulnerable to
developing a painful condition in adulthood called shingles. Now vaccinated
children won’t get shingles when they grow up. Unfortunately, everyone else
who suffered through chicken pox before then — and that’s most readers! —
is at risk for developing shingles.
Shingles causes painful blisters in a band on the torso or around the nose and
eyes. Both chicken pox and shingles are caused by an infection of one or more
nerves with a virus called varicella-zoster. About 15 percent of patients who
develop shingles go on to develop a painful condition called postherpetic neural-
gia (PHN). If an initial bout of shingles is severe, it’s even more likely to cause
PHN. Both shingles and PHN primarily strike older people ages 65 and older.
PHN causes throbbing, aching, itching, and other painful symptoms that can
last for years. The affected area can become so sensitive that even a slight
touch can be excruciatingly painful.
Getting immunized (even if you’ve had chicken pox) with the varicella vaccine
may reduce the chances of getting shingles or PHN. In addition, taking oral
acyclovir, used to treat outbreaks caused by the herpes viruses, may also be
preventive. The faster you take these drugs, the more effective they’ll be.
As with TN, the drugs used most frequently for treating PHN are anticonvul-
sants, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol) and phenytoin (Dilantin). Other
drugs used to treat this condition are antidepressants, muscles relaxants,
and opioids. Some people find capsaicin cream (Zostrix), the substance
found in hot peppers, or the topical numbing cream, lidocaine, to be helpful.
Lidocaine is also available in a patch, available by prescription (Lidoderm).
Epidural steroid injections, which places the anti-inflammatory cortisone
directly around spinal nerves, may also be helpful in bringing relief.

any people fear the pain that’s caused by cancer more than anything else
about the disease, including death. However, while pain management for
people with cancer is still evolving, many alternatives for pain control are avail-
able to you and your loved ones with cancer. This chapter discusses the major
types of medical treatment for cancer pain. Many people also find that comple-
mentary and alternative methods, such as biofeedback and acupuncture, are
helpful for cancer pain. For more information on these methods, see Chapter 15.
Frightening and Shockingly 
Common: Cancer
Perhaps nothing is more frightening than hearing the words, “You have cancer.”
And it’s incredible to think that men have a 1 in 2 chance of hearing these
words from their doctor in their lifetime, and women have a 1 in 3 chance of
getting this diagnosis.
More than 100 types of cancer can invade virtually every part of your body,
from your skin and bones to your internal organs and your blood. All types of
cancer are caused by abnormal runaway cells that, for some reason, begin to
replicate wildly. These turncoat cells sometimes spread to other parts of your
body and attack healthy tissue. It’s this disease process, called metastasis, that
makes cancer such a monster and that also can lead to severe, long-term pain.
The cruel truth is that chronic pain often accompanies cancer. According to
the National Cancer Institute, 70 to 90 percent of people with advanced cancer
have pain, and about a third of people with early cancers also have pain. Yet
many types of cancer, such as leukemia and lymphoma, are not painful at all.

136
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
In general, the painful cancers are those that cause tumors (growths of tissue
that group together in a mass).
Cancer pain has been described as aching, sharp, burning, and throbbing. It
is usually caused by tumors that are growing and pressing in on nociceptors
in healthy tissues, organs, and vessels. (For an explanation of nociceptors,
see Chapter 2.) Bone pain is a common consequence of advanced cancer. It is
the result of the disease moving to the spine, skull, or other parts of the
skeleton. Bone pain is most common for patients with advanced cancers of
the lung, bronchus, breast, rectum, prostate, colon, and kidney. Other types
of cancer pain are caused by:
 Surgery to remove tumors
 A low blood supply due to blood vessels squeezed by tumors
 Inflammation due to the damage caused by growing tumors
 Musculoskeletal pain caused by immobility
Unfortunately, you can get hit with all these types of pain. In addition, the
cancer may secrete chemicals in the region of the tumor that can cause pain.
Treating the cancer can help relieve this pain.
If you or a loved one has cancer and you experience changes in your bowel and
bladder function and/or a sharp pain in your back or neck, the cancer may have
reached your spine. This metastasizing can cause paralysis and other problems,
so get help right away. The tumor can be treated by radiation or surgery.
It’s not a pleasant prospect, but breakthrough pain, or pain overlaying pain, is
common for people with cancer. Breakthrough pain occurs when the individ-
ual has a continuous level of pain and then, despite using painkillers, even
more pain breaks through, causing the pain level to soar. More than half of
people with cancer report this type of severe pain. Breakthrough pain is often
treated with opiates. A short-acting drug may be combined with a long-acting
drug to combat breakthrough pain.
Shingles pain and cancer
Shingles, a painful re-outbreak of the chicken
pox virus that you had as child, can strike
people with cancer because their immune sys-
tems are so impaired. Shingles attacks can lead
to post-herpetic neuralgia, which is extremely
painful and difficult to treat. (For more informa-
tion on post-herpetic neuralgia, see Chapter 11.)
Treatment for shingles includes painkillers, as
well as sedatives, antidepressants, and anti-
seizure medications.

If you have breakthrough pain at predictable intervals, head it off by taking a
painkiller a half hour or so before the pain usually strikes.
The WHO? The World 
Health Organization
Yes, the WHO was a ’70s rock group, but there’s also the WHO as in the World
Health Organization, an international group devoted to medical issues.
According to WHO, about 90 percent of all cancer pain is treatable. In fact,
WHO developed a treatment ladder, shown in Figure 12-1, which is widely
used by physicians around the world as a guideline for treating cancer pain.

Chapter 12: Cancer Pain

The analgesic ladder has three steps:
1. Start with non-opioid analgesics for mild pain.
2. If non-opioids don’t provide relief, move to weak opioids in addition
to, or without, a non-opioid.
3. If the weaker opioids don’t work, use stronger opioids for more severe
pain or combine non-opioids with stronger opioids in this stage.
In 2006, on the 20th anniversary of the launching of the WHO analgesic
ladder, Dr. Kathleen Foley, former chair of the WHO Expert Committee on
Cancer Pain Relief and Active Supportive Care, made important clarifications
to the WHO analgesic ladder. Many of these suggestions are important to
understand if you or a loved one has cancer pain.
 Your goals as a cancer patient and your doctor’s goals should be to
• Increase your hours of pain-free sleep
• Relieve your pain when you’re resting
• Relieve your pain when you’re standing or active
 Drugs alone can usually give you adequate relief from pain caused by
cancer.
 The drug must be given in the right dose and at the right time.
 Taking all pain-killing drugs by mouth is preferred.
138
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 
The American Cancer Society’s 
position on pain medicines
Many people fear becoming addicted to pain
medicines. But, in fact, the American Cancer
Society’s official position is the following:
“People who take cancer pain medicines, as
prescribed by the doctor, rarely become
addicted to them: Addiction is a common fear of
people taking pain medicine. Such fear may
prevent people from taking the medicine.”
The American Cancer Society also says that
fear of possible addiction may cause family
members to encourage a cancer patient to
“hold off” as long as possible between doses.
This is a bad idea! Instead, pain should be
treated before it hits a peak. Otherwise, it’s
much harder to control it.
When opioids (also known as narcotics) — the
strongest pain relievers available — are used
for pain, they rarely cause addiction. When
you’re ready to stop taking opioids, the doctor
gradually lowers the amount of medicine you’re
taking. By the time you stop using the drug, the
body has had time to adjust. Talk to your doctor,
nurse, or pharmacist about how to use pain
medicines safely and discuss any concerns you
have about addiction.

 Take your drugs by the clock for persistent pain. In other words, take
painkillers according to directions at the prescribed times, not as
needed or when you think of it.
 The right dose of an analgesic is the dose that relieves your pain. For
example, the dose of oral morphine may range from as little as 5 mg to
more than 1,000 mg depending on the patient’s tolerance level.
 Adjuvant drugs should be prescribed as indicated. (For information
about adjuvant drugs, check out the upcoming section “Checking Out
Helper Drugs.”)
 Pay attention to detail. Be sure to tell your doctor(s) whether the painkillers
you’re taking are working. Maybe you need a different drug. Your goal is to
receive the maximum benefit with as few side effects as possible.
Educating Yourself about Opioids
If you or a loved one has extensive tumors, you may quickly progress to the
third step on the WHO ladder. (See the section “The WHO? The World Health
Organization,” earlier in this chapter, for more on this ladder.) If so, opioids
are the core treatment for your cancer pain. Different types of opioids help
with different types of pain.
 Short-acting opiods: If pain strikes primarily when you’re active, such as
when you’re shopping at the grocery store, visiting your grandchildren,
or doing housework, then your doctor may prescribe a short-acting
opioid to help you continue with these activities. Examples of short-
acting opiods are oxycodone or hydromorphone.
 Long-acting opiods: If your pain is a constant companion, your doctor
may prescribe long-acting opioids. Examples of long-acting opioids are
MS Contin, OxyContin, Methadone, and Duragesic. You may also need a
low dose of a short-acting opioid.
Unfortunately, most people who’ve been taking opioids for a long period of
time develop a tolerance to the opioid that they’re using for pain. Tolerance
means that it takes increasing dosages to achieve the same level of comfort
that you were getting from your opioid medication. (For more information on
tolerance to opioids, see Chapter 14.) Your doctor may use several methods
to help you if you develop tolerance, including rotating with another opioid
and adding in another type of drug called an NMDA antagonist, which can
reduce pain sensitization within the central nervous system.
If your cancer progresses, you may not be able to take medication by mouth
because of nausea. Fentanyl is an opioid available in a skin patch. It skips the
139
Chapter 12: Cancer Pain

digestive system altogether and is one substitute option. (If you and your
doctor are considering Fentanyl patches, be sure to see the warning about
the patch in Chapter 14.)
Your medical providers can also give you opioids by other routes. Less inva-
sive methods include injections or infusions in muscles, veins, or under your
skin. More invasive methods include inserting tubes in the space around the
spinal cord (epidural catheters) or in the spinal cord (intrathecal catheters).
In addition, patient-controlled analgesic devices (PCAs) offer you the flexibility
to control the delivery of your pain medication when you need it (within a
limit set by your doctor). PCAs are usually used for intravenous (IV) opioids,
which means that the opioid goes into your vein through tubing.
The handy devices can even be carried in your pocket. When you feel pain,
you push a button, and pain medicine is delivered through the tube. Because
you’re the one with the pain, only you push the button.
You may decide that you’d rather live with the pain of cancer than put up
with the drowsiness, hallucinations, and other side effects that can occur
with opioids. Obviously, this choice is up to you.
If the opioids you’re taking make you feel drowsy and/or confused, your doctors
may be able to prescribe other medications to help with these side effects,
such as stimulants or helper pain drugs (called adjuvants). If this approach is
successful, you may be able to lower the dose of the opioid you are taking.
Checking Out “Helper” Drugs
If you or a loved one has side effects from cancer medications and/or the
drugs are not managing your pain, adding helper drugs, called adjuvant anal-
gesics may work for you. (Adjuvant means something that helps or assists.)
Adjuvant analgesics don’t relieve pain on their own, but instead can boost
the relief given by analgesics when taken along with them. Your doctor may
prescribe these medications for you along with opioids and NSAIDs.
Adjuvants are often used for bone pain and may also be prescribed together,
such as an antidepressant and a bisphosphonate.
The following list gives examples of frequently used helper drugs for cancer.
 Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil) and nortriptyline
(Pamelor), can provide nerve pain relief and help people sleep better.
Side effects may include dizziness and gastrointestinal problems. The
drugs usually take a couple of weeks to take effect.
140
Part II: Detailing Some Causes of Chronic Pain 

 Anticonvulsants, such as Neurontin (Gabapentin), were originally
developed to help control seizures, but they can also relieve tingling or
burning from nerve injury (neuropathic pain). (See Chapter 11 for informa-
tion on neuropathic pain.) Like antidepressants, the benefits of anticonvul-
sants take awhile to kick in. If you’re taking an anticonvulsant, your doctor
will want to run drug tests frequently because these drugs can damage the
liver and reduce the number of red and white cells in the blood.
 Bisphosphonates, such as Actonelor Fosamax, are drugs that help slow
down bone loss. They’re used to treat cancers that have metastasized to
the bones. Cancer cells in the bones cause the breakdown of too much
tissue, weakening bone and putting you at high risk for fractures. The break-
down of bone cells also causes pain. Bisphosphonates can reduce both the
pain and fractures. On the down side, bisphosphonates may cause upper
gastrointestinal disorders, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, and gas-
tric ulcer.
 Radiopharmaceuticals are targeted drugs injected into an individual’s
veins. They accumulate in cancerous bone tissue and give off radiation
that kills the cancer cells and can significantly relieve pain. Strontium
chloride Sr 89 (strontium-89) is the most common radiopharmaceutical
used to treat bone cancer or cancer that has metastasized to the bone.

When Medicine Isn’t Enough
The harsh reality is that medications don’t always conquer cancer pain. If
this situation is the case for you or your loved one, several other treatments
can reduce pain by shrinking tumors. Radiation is often the first choice. In
addition, nerve blocks or implanted pumps may help relieve pain. When a
tumor presses on nerves or other body parts, surgery may also help. (See
Chapter 16 for more information on nerve blocks, pain pumps, and surgery.)

 Sharing information with your doctor
W
hen you have a chronic pain condition, you need your own anti-pain
team, but what on earth is that? Well, your treatment is likely to
involve a number of medical professionals and paraprofessionals, such as a
primary care physician (PCP), a medical specialist, a physical therapist, a
massage therapist, a dietician, or others. Such experts are members of your
anti-pain team.
Of course, you want a cracker-jack team to help tame your pain into a reason-
able level of submission. To ensure the success of your team in combating
your pain problem, enlist professionals with whom you’re comfortable and
who have the skills and experience to help you reduce your pain and actually
enjoy your life. (Maybe you haven’t had that experience for awhile!) Forming
a team, though, doesn’t just happen; it does require research on your part. 
To make your job easier, this chapter provides detailed information on what
to look for in a doctor and questions to ask when assembling your team.
Understanding How a Team Helps You
If the word team scares you a little because you think you’ll have to spend 
a lot of time managing the players, don’t panic because the opposite is true.

Setting up an effective anti-pain team means that you’ll spend less time with
your doctors and other health providers and more time enjoying your life.
With a skilled and efficient team, you won’t have gaps in your care or treat-
ment, which means you should have less pain. Also, the time you do spend
with providers will be better spent, and you won’t be going from health
provider to health provider looking for relief that somehow never comes.
Once your team is assembled, be upfront with your care providers. The more
the members of your team know about you and your chronic pain condition,
the better they can do their jobs.
Assembling Your Team
You’re the only one who knows what your pain feels like, so you’re the only
one who knows if and when your pain treatments are working. For these 
reasons, the person who should manage your anti-pain team is you.
An important responsibility of managing your team is to be informed about
your condition or conditions so that you can communicate effectively 
with all the providers in your group. One way to educate yourself is to take
advantage of resources available through national associations and support
groups. (Read about these resources in the section “Educating Yourself as
Much as Possible,” later in this chapter.)
The first member on your team is your primary care physician (PCP), so you
want to be extra careful when selecting this person. As the manager of your
team, you’ll be responsible, along with your PCP, for finding and recruiting
the rest of the players.
An anti-pain team that works for someone else, even if that person is close to
you, may not work well for you.
One of the first actions you should take as manager of your team is to make
sure that you’ve lined up a qualified primary care physician who you feel
respects and listens to you. A good primary care doctor will get to know you
and your physical, psychological, and social situation. This big picture of you
puts your doctor in a great position to help you take charge of your chronic
pain. (The doctor acting in this capacity may also be a specialist such as a
rheumatologist or pediatrician.)
146
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Your primary care physician may have taken care of you for years. In that
case, use the following sections to assess her to make sure that continuing
with this doctor is the right thing to do. If you’re looking for someone new,
use the guidelines in these sections to find the right person.
Primary care doctors come in different types with different backgrounds and
skill sets, which may make a difference in your care.
 General practitioners or family doctors take care of the entire family.
Their training enables them to diagnose and treat health problems of
patients from childhood to older age. They’re a great option if you prefer
one doctor to get to know and take care of you and your whole family.
 General internists are trained in the wide range of adult health problems.
As a general rule, they do not provide care for children.
 Pediatricians are internists who care for and treat children from birth
through the teens. If your child has chronic pain, you’ll want to find a
pediatrician experienced in treating the condition causing the problem.
 Geriatricians are internists who care for and treat older adults. If you 
or a loved one is over age 65, geriatricians are a great choice because 
of their special training in taking care of age-related health problems. In
addition, because chronic pain is common for older adults, geriatricians
are usually quite knowledgeable about treating people who are hurting.
147
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team
What primary care physicians do
Primary care physicians hail back to the old-style
family physician. In fact, your best choice for a
primary care physician may be a family doctor
whom you’ve been going to for many years.
The primary care physician looks at the whole
person, not just one body part or disease state,
which is particularly important because chronic
pain affects all parts of your life. Many primary
care physicians keep up to speed on treating
pain and companion problems, such as depres-
sion and fatigue, and give you first-rate care.
Often, they try to treat you before sending 
you to a specialist, such as a rheumatologist,
cardiologist, or doctor who specializes in pain
management.
Your primary care physician oversees all medical
care. You see the doctor on a regular basis, and
he conducts physicals to assess your overall
health. He’ll also order lab tests, refer you to and
keep a list of the other doctors you see, and main-
tain records of your health conditions. In fact, the
other doctors you see send a report back to your
primary care physician every time you visit them.
Your primary care physician also oversees all
your medications, which helps prevent duplica-
tion, overmedication, and toxic drug reactions.

Resources for locating a PCP include these association Web sites where 
you can find lists of certified doctors who practice in every area of the 
country:
 American Academy of Family Physicians: http://family
doctor.org
 American Board of Internal Medicine: www.abim.org
 American Academy of Pediatrics: www.aap.org
 American Geriatrics Society: www.americangeriatrics.org
Searching for the Right Doctor
When looking for a PCP or any other doctor on your team, you need to 
know about their expertise level. In fact, you have the right to know this
information. You also need to identify what’s most important to you in 
your relationship with your doctors so that you can make the best choices.
The following sections arm you with information to achieve both tasks.
Getting recommendations
How do you find the right doctors for your anti-pain team? If you have a good
relationship with a physician — someone you respect and are comfortable
with — you may want to start by talking to him. In addition, your family,
friends, coworkers, and other health professionals can often help you.
Ask people you know these questions:
 What do you like about your primary care physician?
 Do you know any physicians who treat people with my condition?
You should collect several names because some physicians may not have
some of the criteria that you’ll want your doctor to meet. (For more on this
topic, see the next section, “Figuring out what skills are important to you.”) 
A doctor who is mentioned frequently may be a good one to check out.
If you need more help finding names of good doctors, your insurance provider
may be a good resource. Also ask local doctors, local hospitals, or medical
centers, medical societies, or medical schools in your community for the
name of a doctor who treats your condition. You may even be able to call a
county medical society.
In addition, if you belong to a managed-care plan, the plan’s membership 
services office can give you a list of its approved doctors. We provide infor-
mation on this topic in the sidebar called “Working within a managed-care
plan” later on in this chapter.
148
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Figuring out what skills 
are important to you
If you’re like most people, you want your doctor to have great people skills. 
A 2005 survey of 2,267 adults by Harris Interactive Polls studied this issue.
The researchers wanted to know what characteristics people look for when
choosing a doctor. Eighty-five percent said it’s extremely important for 
doctors to be respectful. They also wanted their doctors to carefully listen 
to their health concerns and questions (84 percent); be easy to talk to 
(84 percent); take their concerns seriously (83 percent); and be willing 
to spend enough time with them (81 percent). In the Harris survey, these
people skills rated higher than good medical judgment (80 percent)!
People skills are very important for doctors who treat patients with chronic
pain because you can’t measure hurting with blood tests or medical instru-
ments. Pain is a subjective problem, and the only way the doctor can learn
about it is through eye contact and conversation.
You also may have your own personal criteria for choosing a doctor. For
example, many women prefer to go to female physicians, and some men
prefer male doctors. Some people like to go to doctors who practice the 
same religion that they do. Some patients want to see only seasoned doctors
who have been practicing for well over a decade. Others prefer that their
doctors be in their early 30s because they feel that younger doctors are more
aware of the latest treatments. Your personal criteria are important because
they can affect your ability to relate to and trust your primary care physician.
For example, if you’re a woman who prefers female doctors, it may be
because you don’t feel comfortable taking your clothes off for a physical
examination by a male doctor. Or, if you don’t agree with your doctor’s 
religious orientation, you may not trust her judgment when it comes to
important medical decisions.
Don’t talk yourself into a doctor who doesn’t meet your criteria unless you
are in a remote area and your options are very limited.
Checking out a doctor’s qualifications
Not only is it important that your primary care doctor have great people
skills and meet your personal criteria (see preceding section), but you’ll also
want your physician to be smart, up-to-date on new pain treatments and
other important medical issues, and have great credentials.
When looking for a primary care physician, be prepared to do a little digging
about her background and practice. A call to the doctor’s office will probably
give you the information you need. Doctors’ staffs are usually trained to
answer the following questions:
149
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team

 What are the doctor’s professional credentials? You want to know
whether your doctor graduated from an accredited medical school. Ask
the doctor’s nurse or other staff where he went to medical school and
then contact the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) by
calling 202-828-0400 or visiting its Web site at www.aamc.org to see
whether the school is accredited.
If the doctor graduated from a school in another country, the school
won’t be accredited by or listed on the AAMC Web site. However, you
can check to see whether the country where the school is located uses
U.S. standards to accredit its medical schools — 35 countries do so. The
National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation’s
Web site (www.ed.gov) lists these countries.
 Is the doctor board certified? One of the best ways to evaluate primary
care physicians is to be sure that they’re board certified, which means
they had extra training after medical school in a field of medicine, such
as family practice, internal medicine, or geriatrics, and passed a compre-
hensive examination in their specialty. To check out specific doctors, 
go to the American Board of Medical Specialties Web site at www.abms.
org or call its hotline at 800-776-2378.
 What are the doctor’s professional affiliations? Your doctor should
have hospital privileges with a large, well-equipped hospital, which
means he may admit patients to that hospital.
Evaluating whether a doctor 
fits your circumstances
Some doctors have great people skills or excellent medical qualifications, but
other characteristics are deal breakers. For example, maybe you’re interested
in a particular doctor who is very successful at treating people with your
condition, but the office isn’t accessible by public transportation — and you
don’t drive or have a car.
Consider the following factors about a potential doctor’s practice:
 Type of health insurance: Does the doctor accept your insurance? If
not, it’s a deal breaker. Keep looking.
 Location of the office: Is the office close by and convenient? Is parking
easy to use? Is the office near public transportation?
 Lab work: Will you need to go to another location for blood tests? If so,
how far away is it from the primary care physician’s office? Is the lab
that the doctor uses covered by your insurance?
150
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

 Coverage: Who will you see when the doctor isn’t available? Are these
doctors qualified? Do they see a lot of patients with your same health
condition?
 Hospital affiliation: What hospital is the doctor affiliated with? Does it
accept your insurance?
 Physician extenders: Do you feel comfortable in a practice that employs
physician extenders (nurse practitioners or physician’s assistants) that
you may frequently see instead of the doctor?
Interviewing a doctor
If you’ve heard good things about a doctor who meets your needs (see pre-
ceding section), you’re ready to interview him. Whenever possible, interview
candidates for your anti-pain team in person before committing to a specific
individual and a first medical appointment. An eye-to-eye meeting can tell
you a lot about a doctor’s people skills. Many doctors hold meet-and-greet
appointments for this purpose so that you can sit and chat for 10 minutes 
or so and ask questions. The bad news is that the primary care physician
may charge for this time, and your health insurance may not cover the costs
of the appointment. But if you can swing the expense, it’ll be worth it to help
rule out doctors who aren’t a good fit — and rule in physicians you like!
A major purpose of the interview is to discover the doctor’s approach to
managing pain. While many doctors are good at pain management, some 
primary care physicians don’t focus on helping patients control pain, and
they don’t keep informed about new medications and techniques. When 
you go to your meet-and-greet meeting, ask the doctor or staff the following
questions:
 Do you have many patients with my type of chronic pain? Of course,
you should ask this question after you explain what your main problem
is! The doctor doesn’t have to give you an actual number, but should
have a good idea what percentage of his practice has chronic pain. If he
says less than 20 percent, proceed with caution. The doctor may not
have as much experience as you’d like in treating patients with your
condition.
 How do you evaluate your patients’ pain? Hopefully, the doctor 
uses pain scales, a list of questions, or a similar technique to assess 
her patient’s pain problem. (Read more about these evaluations in
Chapter 17.) However, as long as the doctor makes a point to always 
discuss pain with her patients, this doctor still may be a great 
candidate.
151
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team

 What is your success rate in controlling my type of pain? Of course,
you’d love it if the doctor said, “100 percent!” but that number isn’t 
realistic. However, the doctor saying something like, “Some people do
well on XYZ, and others do well with ABC therapy,” is a good sign that
he’s helping a number of people with a problem similar to yours, is 
willing to try different treatments to find the right one, and is having
some success.
 Do you have any special qualifications to treat my chronic pain?
Ideally, you’d like the doctor to have taken additional training in pain
therapy, but a primary care physician with this type of qualification is
hard to find; this issue should not be a deal breaker. If the doctor sees,
diagnoses, and treats many patients with your condition, this hands-on
experience may work well for you.
 What is your approach to using medications to treat my type of
chronic pain? You’re looking for a doctor willing to work with you to
find the best medications for your chronic health problem.
 What is your approach to using alternative or complementary 
medicine to treat my type of chronic pain? You may prefer a doctor
willing to try nontraditional approaches, such as acupuncture and
biofeedback. If so, this question is important. If the doctor pooh-poohs
these approaches, then he’s not for you.
 What is your approach to referring your patients to specialists, such
as rheumatologists, cardiologists, or neurologists? You want the 
doctor to be willing to refer you when your pain control needs are more
specialized than treatments he can offer.
 What pain treatments or therapies would you start with, and what
would you do next if the first one doesn’t work? Your doctor should
have a lot of experience with this issue. The answer should reflect this
experience and be specific. If the doctor brushes off the question, 
proceed with caution.
 What is your approach to treatments such as nerve blocks? The
answer to this question may be, “Only as a last resort.” But the doctor
should have some patients who have had these procedures. If not, 
he may not have enough experience treating patients with severe
chronic pain.
Finding a specialist
A smoothly running anti-pain team addresses the major problems relating 
to your pain and makes you feel comfortable and safe, which often means
including specialists who either focus on the condition itself or on pain 
management in general.
152
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Condition specialists
Many people with chronic pain have a specialist on their team who helps
them manage their particular condition and the pain it causes. For example, 
if you have migraines it’s likely that a neurologist who specializes in caring
for people with severe headaches is an important member of your team. Or, if
you have cancer-related pain, it’s a good bet that your oncologist is a central
member of your team.
The following is a list of common pain problems and the specialists that 
treat them.
 Arthritis: Rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, physical medicine,

Pain management specialists
If your pain is intractable (it won’t go away or lessen), you may want to con-
sider visiting a doctor who specializes in pain management. Pain specialists
diagnose the cause of pain and then treat it. A pain specialist works closely
with your primary care doctor to assess the cause of your pain and find an
appropriate treatment option.
As with primary care doctors, pain specialists have different backgrounds
and expertise:
 Anesthesiologists are traditionally known for making sure that patients
are safe and pain-free during and after surgery or childbirth. In recent
years, their role has expanded to include pain management outside the
operating or delivery room.
 Neurologists diagnose and treat diseases of the nervous system, which
processes pain signals throughout our bodies.
 Neurosurgeons perform surgery on the nervous system.
 Psychiatrists treat and diagnose mental health problems associated with
chronic pain.
 Physiatrists specialize in physical medicine, a branch of medicine that
deals with the treatment, prevention, and diagnosis of disease by 
physical means such as manipulation, massage, and exercise.
When looking for a pain specialist, make sure that you know the type of 
professional who you want to work with. For example, anesthesiologists are
likely to prescribe medications for your pain. Neurologists or neurosurgeons
are likely to suggest nerve blocks or surgeries if warranted. Physiatrists will
do physical restoration and may prescribe medication, but do not perform
surgery. And psychiatrists will conduct behavioral therapy or a similar
approach.
For a comprehensive evaluation and approach to pain management, consider
visiting a comprehensive pain clinic, which usually has all types of pain 
specialists on staff in addition to physical therapists and other professionals.
Read about pain clinics in the upcoming “Locating a pain center” section.

Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

The Web sites of these associations offer lists of pain specialists in every area
of the country:
 American Academy of Pain Management: www.aapainmanage.org
 American Academy of Pain Medicine: www.painmed.org
 National Pain Foundation: www.nationalpainfoundation.org
Other pain professionals 
and paraprofessionals
Many types of professionals and paraprofessionals who aren’t medical 
doctors can help you manage your pain. Some providers, such as physical
therapists, are traditional members of health-care teams, while others 
are new to the mix. For example, more people than ever successfully use
massage to help manage their pain; just a decade ago, massage therapy 
was regarded as a luxury.
The following are key health providers you may consider as members of 
your team:
 Physical therapists (PTs) may be among your best friends. Many people
with chronic pain say that their PT is the one who makes them feel
better day in and day out. (However, if you’ve ever had major orthope-
dic surgery, you probably encountered a PT who, at the peak of your
post-surgical pain, made you get up and move around to get your lungs
moving. Not a fun experience!)
Physical therapists help their patients return function to injured or 
damaged parts of their bodies, improve the ability to move around, and
relieve pain. They also use techniques that promote overall fitness and
health, all of which contribute to pain reduction.
Treatment by a PT can include electrical stimulation, hot packs, cold
compresses, and ultrasound to relieve pain and reduce swelling. They
may use traction or deep-tissue massage to relieve pain. Therapists 
also teach patients to use devices, such as crutches, prostheses
(replacements for body parts), and wheelchairs. They also may show
patients exercises to do at home to reduce pain and aid recovery.
Some physical therapists treat a wide range of ailments; others 
specialize in areas such as pediatrics, geriatrics, orthopedics, sports
medicine, neurology, and cardiopulmonary physical therapy.
155
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team

PTs who are members of the American Physical Therapy Association 
are bound by its code of ethics and are licensed by the state in which
they practice. You can find a list of credentialed PTs at its Web site
(www.apta.org).
 Occupational therapists help people with chronic pain get along better 
in daily life and at work. They can help you learn or relearn how to 
carry out activities in new ways to lessen pain, such as using a computer
or cooking in a different way than you’ve done before. If you have a 
permanent disability, such as a spinal cord injury or rheumatoid arthri-
tis, they teach you how to use adaptive equipment, such as wheelchairs,
orthotics (devises that help support a limb or other body part), and aids
for eating and dressing. They can also design or make special equipment
you may need at home or at work.
To find a qualified occupational therapist, contact your state
Occupational Therapy Association. All 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico have an association. Contact information for every state
is on the American Occupational Therapy Association’s Web site at
www.aota.org.
 Recreational therapists use a variety of techniques, such as sports,
dance, drama, and aqua-exercise, to help clients manage their pain.
Often, you find them in hospitals and other facilities running beneficial
exercise programs, such as warm water exercise for people with 
arthritis and other painful conditions or gentle sports programs for 
children with asthma. The National Council for Therapeutic Recreation
Certification (www.nctrc.org/aboutnctrc.htm) is the nationally 
recognized credentialing organization for recreational therapists.
 Dietitians can help you plan special diets to better manage the condition
causing your pain. They also help patients prevent and treat illnesses 
by promoting healthy eating habits and recommending dietary modifica-
tions, such as eating less salt for people with high blood pressure or
consuming less sugar for people with diabetes. Look for a dietician who
has received accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for
Dietetics Education at www.cdrnet.org.
 Fitness instructors can help people with pain enjoy exercise and get its
benefits without causing new or further injury. Many organizations cer-
tify fitness instructors. One way to ensure that a certifying organization
is reputable is to check whether it’s accredited or seeking accreditation
by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (www.noca.org/
ncca/accredorg.htm).
 Massage therapists use rubbing, stroking, and other manipulations on
your soft tissues to improve your body’s circulation and remove waste
products from your knotted muscles. The treatment can loosen up and
soothe a stiff and sore body.
156
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Massage therapists can specialize in more than 80 different types of 
massage, such as Swedish massage (rubbing in the same direction as the
flow of blood) and acupressure (applying pressure to key points on the
skin). Talk with your primary care physician and/or physical therapist
about the type of massage that would be most beneficial for you.
 Orthotists and prosthetists (O and Ps) help patients with disabling 
conditions of their arms, legs, or spine or with the loss of a limb by 
fitting and preparing orthopedic braces and prostheses. Materials 
originally developed for aerospace and new technologies have resulted
in great advances in this industry. For example, people who have lost 
a foot can now purchase a special prosthesis for golf or tennis with
custom muscle sensors and computer chips that enable them to 
comfortably enjoy their sport.
If you need the services of these professionals, find a highly trained 
and competent provider because an ill-fitting devise can cause 
pain and loss of mobility. Look for a professional who is a member 
of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists (www.op
careers.org).
Educating Yourself as Much as Possible
Many other factors can influence the quality of your anti-pain team and 
the care it provides. For starters, the type of insurance you have can have
wide-reaching effects on your care. For example, if you have fibromyalgia 
and the top fibro specialist in your town isn’t covered by your insurance
company, you may want to consider switching to a different plan.
Also, the type and quality of the hospital in which you’re treated are keys to
quality care. Recent studies have shown that patients at better hospitals
have better results.
Last, roll up your sleeves and discover as much as possible about chronic pain
and how to manage it. If you educate yourself, you’ll make confident decisions.
Identifying a hospital
Depending on where you live, your health insurance, and other circum-
stances, you may not have a choice of hospitals available to you. However,
hospitals differ greatly in staff competence, care quality, and success rates
with different conditions. If you do have a choice, do a little detective work 
to find the best option for you. Here are some guidelines:
157
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team

 Find out whether the hospital offers the full range of services needed 
to treat your condition and its expertise and success rate with it. For
example, if you have rheumatoid arthritis and live in a rural area, your
hospital may not have experience in treating your condition, and you
may have to go out of your geographic area to find the care and pain
control you need.
158
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 
Working within a managed-care plan
If your insurance is through your employer or you
are a Medicare beneficiary, you may be in a
managed-care plan. These plans control the cost
and delivery of health services by contracting
with a network of doctors, hospitals, and other
professionals.
Managed-care plans come in three major types:
 Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
contract with physicians, hospitals, and
other providers who belong to their provider
networks. Members select primary care
physicians from the HMO’s network, and that
doctor oversees all aspects of the member’s
care. If you belong to an HMO, you can see
a specialist or other “outside” providers,
such as rheumatologists or physical thera-
pists, only if your primary care physician
authorizes it. If you visit a specialist on your
own, your HMO won’t pay for it.
 Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) 
are similar to HMOs, but provide more 
flexibility. They also contract with health-
care providers to form provider networks.
However, unlike HMOs, members don’t have
to have primary care providers, and they
don’t have to use one of the plan’s con-
tracted providers for their care. However, if
you belong to a PPO, you pay less if you see
the plan’s doctors instead of someone out-
side the network, and you probably won’t
have to get a referral to see a specialist.
 Point-Of-Service Plans (POSs) are options in
which members can choose to use an HMO
or PPO each time they seek health care.
Seeing a specialist depends on which alter-
native they choose.
It’s important to understand how the plans oper-
ate because they often differ in how they work
with primary care physicians and whether they
allow referrals to pain and other specialists.
Two associations offer lists of managed-care
plans for consumers in every area of the coun-
try. While they don’t rate plans according to suc-
cess in pain management, their evaluation
measures show which plans are doing the best
job of overall patient care:
 The National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA) evaluates and rates
managed-care plans. NCQA’s Health Plan
Report Card (http://hprc.ncqa.org)
is an interactive tool that can help con-
sumers find health plans that fit their partic-
ular needs.
 URAC, which used to be called the Utilization
Review Accreditation Commission until 1996
when its name was shortened, develops
quality (accreditation) standards for man-
aged-care plans. For a list of accredited
managed-care programs, go to http://
webapps.urac.org/directory/dir
search.asp.

 Some government agencies or voluntary health organizations accredit 
or designate hospitals specializing in conditions, such as cancer, cardiac
care, or rheumatology. Make sure that the hospital you’re considering
has received such an acknowledgment. To locate the appropriate 
contact information, check out the chapter in Part II that addresses 
your condition. For example, to find a hospital designated as a cancer
care center, check with the National Cancer Institute or American
Cancer Society. Its contact information is listed in Chapter 12.
 In some cases a hospital that conducts research into the cause and
treatment of your condition is a good choice. To locate such hospitals,
use the contact information provided in the chapter in Part II that
relates to your condition.
 Find out whether the hospital has programs to improve patient safety
and reduce medical errors. Most hospitals are now introducing such
programs, and those that aren’t are behind the times.
 Some states prepare reports showing outcomes for certain procedures,
such as open-heart surgery. If your state publishes such information,
find out the outcomes for the hospitals in your area.
 The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO) sets quality standards for hospitals. Reviews are done at 
least every three years. Most hospitals participate in this program, and
it’s a red flag when a facility doesn’t follow JCAHO standards. To find
hospitals in your area that adhere to JCAHO’s quality standards, go to
www.jcaho.org.
Locating a pain center
Being evaluated and treated at a pain center can be a lifesaver for people
with relentless pain. Based on the understanding that chronic pain affects
many areas of victims’ lives, pain centers offer a broad range of evaluation
and care. The staffs of pain centers typically include specialists from all 
medical disciplines, such as anesthesiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons,
physiatrists, psychiatrists, nurses, physical therapists, occupational thera-
pists, counselors, nutritionists, and recreational therapists. Evaluation 
and treatment in pain centers can range from short-term and outpatient to
extensive in-facility care.
The Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) provides
a listing of pain programs that meet its quality standards. Your health 
insurance may require that any program you visit be accredited by CARF
(www.carf.org).
159
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team

Exploring resources from condition-specific
organizations
The old adage that information is power is particularly appropriate for 
managing chronic pain. The more you know about your health problem and
the pain it causes, the better prepared you are to manage both. And, when
you have up-to-date information about your condition and its treatments, you
and your primary care physician can recruit a cracker-jack anti-pain team.
Be sure to look over the relevant chapter in Part II that addresses your 
pain condition and check out the resources listed there. In addition, the 
following Web sites offer information about managing pain and pain-causing
conditions:
 The National Pain Foundation: www.nationalpainfoundation.org
 The American Chronic Pain Association: www.theacpa.org
 The American Pain Foundation: www.painfoundation.org
You can also find information specific to many pain-causing conditions on
these Web sites:
 The Cleveland Clinic: www.clevelandclinic.org
 Mayo Clinic: www.mayoclinic.com
 National Library of Medicine: www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/
healthtopics.html
Joining a support group
The support and help of those who “have been there” and who also suffer
from chronic pain can lessen your feelings of isolation, give comfort, and 
provide you with first-hand recommendations of providers and services. 
A first-rate support group focuses on positive ways to manage pain and 
doesn’t wallow in the negatives of the condition. (In other words, support
group meetings aren’t pity parties.) Here are key resources for finding a
group near you or on the Web:
 The American Chronic Pain Association (www.theacpa.org) has 
support groups across the country.
 The American Pain Foundation’s PainAid (http://painaid.pain
foundation.org) service is an interactive online community for
160
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

people with acute and chronic pain. It offers live chats, discussion
boards, message boards, and Ask the Experts chat rooms.
 The National Pain Foundation’s My Community (www.national
painfoundation.org/MyCommunity) offers a monitored online 
chat group and question and answer service.
Telling Your Doctors What 
They Need to Know
Incomplete and garbled information can result in a frustrating situation 
and a missed opportunity. If your doctors don’t have complete and accurate
information about you, their treatment of your health condition will likely 
be off target. When your health is at stake, being off target can have painful
and serious consequences.
The following sections provide important topics to address so that your 
doctors have the information they need to give you first-class care.
Overcoming shyness
If you’re like most people, your contacts with your doctors are one of the
most intimate relationships you have. One of this book’s authors, Dr. Kassan,
puts it this way: “Some of my patients tell me things they don’t tell anyone
else. It’s an honor.” In fact, you, the patient, must tell your doctors the most
intimate personal details about your health even if you’ve just met. Often,
you’ll also have to undress and allow the doctor to poke into private parts of
your anatomy. Most people are uncomfortable with such exposure.
It’s extremely important to override any feelings of discomfort and embar-
rassment you may have and to tell your doctor about all current and past
health care problems that may be related to your condition.
Take Glenda, for example, who has had chronic pelvic floor pain for many
years, but didn’t make an appointment with her primary care doctor when
she noticed blood in her urine. This situation went on for months until she
finally had an annual physical, and lab tests revealed the problem. Glenda
had avoided the conversation about her urine out of embarrassment, 
even though she knew that blood in urine is abnormal and one common
symptom of bladder or kidney cancer. “I just didn’t want to talk about it,”
says Glenda. Unfortunately, Glenda had bladder cancer. So far, she has 
161
Chapter 13: Putting Together an Anti-Pain Team

beaten the cancer, but only after her bladder was removed, a life-changing
outcome that complicated her pelvic floor pain. Glenda’s story demonstrates
the importance of telling your primary care doctor when health problems,
signs, and symptoms occur.
Knowing what to tell your doctor
Be sure to share the following information during your exams with your 
primary care and other doctors:
 All symptoms you’re having: Symptoms may include such problems as
severe pain, rashes, shakiness, headaches, or stiffness.
 Your health history: Give the doctor a well-organized description of
your present symptoms and any related personal history. For example, 
if your pain started soon after a car accident, tell the physician about
the accident, even if the pain has moved to a different place in your
body. Did your arthritis symptoms start after a tick bite? Mention it to
your doctor. Many people find it helps to draw up lists to share with
their doctors so that they don’t forget anything. If you’ve created a 
personal health notebook, it’s handy for such purposes.
 Your pain diary: Give the doctor the highlights from your pain diary if
you have developed one.
 A list of all medicines you’re currently taking, including over-the-
counter drugs: Bring a list of your medications by name, how often you
take them and at what times, and the strengths of the medicines. (You
may want to copy and use the log we provide in Chapter 17.)
 All side effects you have from your medicine(s): Side effects are prob-
lems, such as sleepiness or rashes. Most medications and supplements
have such reactions. However, each drug has its own particular set of
side effects. Even aspirin can have side effects, and some painkillers
have such harsh side effects that many people would rather put up with
the pain than suffer through them.
 All vitamins or supplements you take (particularly if you take them in
high doses): Vitamins and supplements can interact with any drugs you
take or with each other and can be harmful in and of themselves. (See
Chapter 15 for more information on how vitamins and supplements can
be dangerous in certain combinations.) 
 Any relevant X-rays, tests results, or medical records: These items may
help your doctor diagnose and treat your condition.
 Any emotional or mental health issues: Let your doctor know whether
you’re depressed, anxious, or having other problems. Your doctor may
be able to help with these issues, and she should know about them
because they can affect your level of pain.

Chapter 14
Prescribing Medicines 
for Chronic Pain
In This Chapter
 Using OTC drugs to get pain relief
 Delving in to prescription medication
 Getting the right dose
 Avoiding drug and alcohol abuse
M
any people turn to painkillers, both over the counter and prescribed,
to alleviate or reduce their chronic pain. In this chapter, you read
about the benefits and side effects of a wide range of drugs used against
chronic pain. You may find that one of these medicines, either alone or in
combination with another drug, works well for you.
Keep in mind that while they can reduce the severity of your chronic pain,
even the most powerful medicines can’t totally remove it forever. So while
taking pain-killing drugs is central to the management of many types of
chronic pain, you also need to try the other pain management techniques
described in Parts III and IV.
Finding Pain Relief Over the Counter
If you have chronic pain, analgesics are probably an important part of your
medical care. Analgesia means an absence of pain, but the word analgesic is
used to describe drugs or treatments that lessen pain (but rarely eliminate
it). Analgesics either reduce pain signals going to your brain, or they interfere
with your brain’s reaction to these signals.
Analgesics include over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, which you can buy without
a prescription, and prescribed, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), as well as opioids.

In addition, drugs that are often used for other purposes, such as antidepres-
sants or antiseizure drugs, have been found to be beneficial (even though
these other drugs aren’t technically called analgesics).
OTC drugs come in many forms: tablets, patches, suppositories, sprays,
creams, and ointments. OTC pain products include acetaminophen (Tylenol),
aspirin (Bayer), naproxen sodium (Aleve), ketoprofen (Orudis KT), ibuprofen
(Advil and Motrin), and combinations of these drugs. Less expensive generic
versions of these OTC drugs are often available, sometimes from pharmacy
chains.
Make sure that you know what’s in the OTC drugs you’re purchasing. Some
pharmaceutical companies combine ingredients, such as a decongestant or
antihistamine along with painkillers. Look for a drug’s active ingredients,
listed by generic name, on its product’s label. The ingredients are listed in
order of prominence on the label. One of the secondary ingredients may not
agree with you. For example, Tylenol PM combines both acetaminophen and
diphenhydramine hydrochloride (a drug used to treat hay fever, allergies,
and the common cold). If you have trouble sleeping specifically because of
your pain and you don’t suffer from allergies, you could take regular Tylenol
without the diphenhydramine hydrochloride to avoid feeling hung over and
dried out the next day.
You may wonder what extra strength means on the labels of some painkillers.
These drugs contain more of the main ingredient per dosage than the 
standard product sold by the same manufacturer. For example, regular
strength Tylenol has 325 mg of acetaminophen in each tablet, and Extra
Strength Tylenol has 500 mg of acetaminophen in each tablet.
164
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 
Appreciating off-label use
All medications are officially approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for one or
more medical problems. Based on their knowl-
edge and experience, doctors sometimes prac-
tice off-label use, which is when they prescribe
drugs for medical problems other than the origi-
nally intended use.
Most drugs have a variety of medical uses. For
example, aspirin is effective against inflammation
and pain, but it’s also used as a blood thinner to
prevent heart attacks. Similarly, many other drugs
used for treating chronic pain were originally
designed and marketed for other conditions, such
as depression or heart rhythm problems.
Don’t worry if your doctor is prescribing off label.
It’s accepted medical practice and perfectly legal
for your doctor to use a medication off label. The
only problem is that sometimes your insurer or
health plan may object to paying for the particu-
lar use your doctor is recommending.

Two categories of over-the-counter drugs are used to reduce pain:
 Acetaminophen is well known by its brand name, Tylenol. Scientists
don’t really know how acetaminophen works, but they know that it
raises the pain threshold. In other words, if you take acetaminophen, you
can tolerate a greater amount of pain before you feel it. Acetaminophen
is used to relieve mild to moderate chronic pain and also reduces fever.
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce pain, fever, 
and inflammation. (The term nonsteroidal is used to distinguish these
drugs from steroids, which are also used for inflammation.) Aspirin 
and ibuprofen (Advil) are the best known NSAIDs. NSAIDs don’t cause
drowsiness, nor do they slow down breathing as some narcotics do.
However, they’re not problem-free. They can cause stomach ulcers and
heartburn.
While you can purchase most NSAIDs over the counter, some are 
available only by prescription. See the next section, “Seeking Pain Relief
with Prescription Drugs,” about these drugs.
OTC painkillers can be dangerous in some situations. For example, heavy
drinkers should be wary of taking acetaminophen (the ingredient in Tylenol
and many other OTC pain and cold remedies). Your liver will thank you if
you’re careful, because acetaminophen can actually be toxic to it. Of course,
it’s also a good idea to give up heavy drinking, which can cause many medical
problems. Taking ibuprofen and drinking alcohol is also a no-no. Alcohol
increases the risk of bleeding in the stomach and intestines, which is a side
effect of this medication.
The maximum recommended dose for acetaminophen is 4 grams or 8 extra
strength (500 mg) tablets in 24 hours. However, the maximum recommended
dose for heavy drinkers is half that, or 2 grams or 4 extra-strength tablets 
in 24 hours. If you have liver disease, talk to your doctor before using 
acetaminophen at all.
Seeking Pain Relief with 
Prescription Drugs
Prescription drugs include some old standards like opioids, NSAIDS, and topi-
cal products. They also include drugs that you may not realize are effective
against pain, including antidepressants, anti-epileptics, sodium channel
blockers, anti-arrhymthic drugs, sedatives, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relax-
ants, antihypertensives, and botulinum toxin.
165
Chapter 14: Prescribing Medicines for Chronic Pain

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are prescribed NSAIDs that have fewer
gastrointestinal side effects with short-term use. As of this writing, celecoxib
(Celebrex) is the only COX-2 inhibitor available. However, you can still
develop ulcers with this drug. While COX-2 inhibitors are associated with
heart risks, evidence is mounting that other NSAIDs may have similar risks.
Some people claim that they gained significant pain relief with COX-2
inhibitors and were upset when most were removed from the market.
Opioids
Opioids are narcotics naturally derived from opium or synthetically derived
and chemically similar to opium. They’re controlled by the federal govern-
ment, and your doctor must follow special rules when prescribing them; 
for example, the more potent opioids can’t routinely be called in to the 
pharmacy by the doctor, and instead, a written prescription must be given 
to the patient. It can’t be refilled.
Opioids are extremely effective in reducing pain. They’re the foundation 
of medical treatment for chronic pain due to cancer and other conditions
causing severe pain.
In some cases, opioids have less severe long-term side effects than anti-
inflammatories. However, opioids have many side effects, including drowsi-
ness, constipation, nausea, disorientation, and retention of urine. We’re not
talking regular constipation here. We’re talking you-can’t-go-for-days consti-
pation. (Stimulant laxatives and increased fluids can help.) Taking too much
of an opioid can cause other serious side effects, including a dangerous slow-
ing of breathing and even coma. A drug called naloxone, given intravenously,
can reverse these effects.
Some people taking opioids for long periods of time develop a tolerance
to the drug, which means that they need higher doses to receive the 
pain-killing benefits. However, increased tolerance doesn’t always occur. 
For some people, the same dose is effective for a long time. No one knows
why this is true.
166
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 
Understanding generics and nongenerics
You can save precious dollars by buying generic
prescriptions, when available. Generic and
brand-name medicines act the same way in
your body and contain the same active ingredi-
ents. Although generic drugs are chemically
identical to their branded counterparts, they’re
typically sold at substantial discounts from the
branded price. According to the Congressional
Budget Office, generic drugs save consumers
$8 to $10 billion a year. Medications can be
pricey! Ask your doctor to prescribe generic
drugs if available.

Many doctors today are concerned that their patients live with considerable
pain because of unfounded fears of addiction.
According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, addiction is a chronic,
relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use,
despite harmful consequences.
When opioids are used regularly for a long time, your nervous system adapts
by increasing the activity of transmitters that increase pain. The result is that
you often experience withdrawal symptoms (including pain) if the drug is
stopped suddenly. If you stop taking opioids after long-term use, taper off
gradually (under your doctor’s orders) to keep symptoms under control.
Opioids are taken by mouth, given by injection, absorbed through the lining
of the cheek or gums, or applied through the skin in a patch. They can also
be administered through special internal pumps for people with extremely
severe chronic pain. If you receive good pain relief from opioids but can’t 
tolerate their side effects, they can be injected directly into the space 
around your spinal cord.
Opioids administered through injections act faster than oral forms, but 
the pain relief doesn’t last as long. One opioid, Fentanyl, is available as a
transdermal skin patch and provides pain relief for up to 72 hours.
167
Chapter 14: Prescribing Medicines for Chronic Pain
Opioids and addiction
Most people believe all narcotics — which are
also called opioids — are addictive, and they
think that if they take them, it’s only a matter of
time before they become junkies ready to sell
their children for drugs. It’s true that people with
past addiction problems should be very careful
with opioids. But most people who take nar-
cotics to manage pain carefully follow their
doctor’s orders and rarely become drug addicts.
(Read more about drug dependence in the sec-
tion “Facing Prescription Drug Abuse” at the
end of this chapter.)
The medical community is now behind effective
prescribing of opioids for treating chronic pain.
In 1996, the American Pain Society and the
American Academy of Pain Medicine issued a
joint consensus statement supporting cautious
use of opioids for people with severe pain prob-
lems. Cautious use means patients and doctors
discuss the risks and benefits of opioids.
Doctors must maintain good records and care-
ful follow-up so that they can determine
whether the drugs are improving the condition
and not causing other problems. (You may also
want to look at Chapter 12 for information about
the American Cancer Society’s position on pre-
scribing opioids for cancer pain. The society’s
position essentially agrees with the consensus
statement by the American Pain Society and the
American Academy of Pain Medicine.)

In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health 
advisory about reports of death and other serious side effects from patients
who overdosed while using Fentanyl transdermal patches. Deaths and 
overdoses have occurred in patients using both the brand-name Duragesic
and the generic form of the drug. Some health-care providers and consumers
may not be fully aware of the dangers of this drug. The directions for using
the Fentanyl skin patch must be followed exactly to prevent serious side
effects from overdose.
Other prescription drugs used 
for pain management
A variety of other prescription drugs are successfully used to manage pain.
The following list covers the pros and cons of these medications:
 Tramadol (Ultram) and tramadol combined with acetaminophen
(Ultracet(tm)) are prescription pain medications for managing moderate
to moderately severe pain. The combination of tramadol and aceta-
minophen is much more powerful than either drug alone. Tramadol 
is considered a weak opioid analgesic. Tramadol doesn’t reduce 
inflammation. Avoid taking more than 400 mg (300 mg in the elderly) 
of tramadol a day.
If you’re thinking about taking tramadol, use caution if you also take any
medications that are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Also, watch out if you’re taking
some antipsychotic medications, such as Thorazine and Compazine.
Sometimes the combination of these drugs with tramadol can cause
problems. If you take any of these drugs, make sure that your doctor 
is aware of it before she writes a prescription for tramadol.
 Propoxyphene is a mild opioid analgesic used for the relief of mild 
to moderate pain. Darvocet-N 50, Darvocet-N 100, and more recently
Darvocet A500 tablets contain propoxyphene with acetaminophen. The
combination of propoxyphene and acetaminophen produces greater
pain relief than produced by either drug alone. Propoxyphene is on the
don’t-take list of drugs for the elderly. (See Chapter 24 for other drugs
older people should avoid.)
 Fiorinal is a strong, non-opioid pain reliever and muscle relaxant. It’s
used for the relief of tension headaches caused by stress or muscle 
contraction in the head, neck, and shoulder area. It combines a barbitu-
rate (butalbital) with a pain reliever (aspirin) and a stimulant (caffeine).
Another option for those who want to avoid aspirin is Fiorcet, which
combines fiorinal with acetaminophen and caffeine.

Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

 Flavocoxid (Limbrel) is a prescription-only product for the management
of osteoarthritis. It’s made from a combination of root and bark extracts
from plants. The plant extracts contain a substance called flavonoids.
Some of these same flavonoids are found in green tea. The flavonoid
extracts, which are compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and certain
beverages, in Limbrel appear to help by halting the production of 
an enzyme that causes inflammation. The FDA classifies Limbrel as a
“medical food.” It’s given as a prescription, but the foods have been
“generally recognized as safe” by the FDA.
Limbrel has the same side-effects that NSAIDs have, including an
increased risk of stomach ulcers. At this writing, no studies show
whether flavocoxid is as effective as NSAIDs are for pain relief. Using
NSAIDs and flavocoxid together may increase the risk of stomach 
irritation.
Antidepressants and anti-epileptics
Some antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs are helpful in managing
chronic pain, especially neuropathic pain (chronic pain caused by injury 
to the peripheral nervous system). The pain-killing effect of these drugs is
independent of their effect on depression.
Antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs are about equally effective for 
neuropathic pain. Duloxetine (Cymbalta), an antidepressant, and pregabalin
(Lyrica), an antiseizure drug, are modestly successful against fibromyalgia
pain. However, they differ in their costs, safety, and side effects. Tricyclic
antidepressants may also help reduce pain.
A few of the many antiepileptic drugs that are effective in the treatment of
neuropathic pain include carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenytoin (Dilantin),
gabapentin (Neurontin), and pregabalin (Lyrica).
If you take medicine for migraines and antidepressants, be sure to read
Chapter 6 about the dangers of combining some drugs.
Antidepressants are particularly helpful in managing certain types of pain.
Note that using antidepressants doesn’t mean that the pain is “all in your
head” and that you’re really depressed instead of being in pain. The pain 
is real, but the limitations it imposes on you can be depressing. Some 
transmitters released during depression increase pain, and people are more
active and effective in counteracting the pain if not depressed.
169
Chapter 14: Prescribing Medicines for Chronic Pain

Some pain states that may respond well to antidepressants include 
the following:
 Central pain
 Rheumatoid arthritis
 Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
 Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), also known as Reflex
Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome (RSDS)
 Diabetic neuropathy
 Fibromyalgia
 Irritable bowel syndrome
 Migraine and tension headache
 Neuropathic pain
 Phantom limb pain
 Phantom limb/neuroma pain
 Postherpetic neuralgia
 Sympathetic dystrophy
Sodium channel blocking and 
oral anti-arrhythmic agents
Injuries to the peripheral or central nervous system can cause spontaneous
activity of neurons in pain pathways. (See Chapter 2 for an explanation of
neurons and pain pathways.) Reducing this unwanted, ongoing activity can
reduce pain, which is why anti-epileptic drugs can be helpful. (Epileptic
seizures result from high levels of spontaneous activity in other regions of
the CNS.)
Other drugs called antirhythmics also have quieting effects on CNS neurons.
They’re prescribed to prevent disturbances in heart rhythm, but they’re 
also used for treating chronic pain. Just as they stop the premature firing of
heart fibers, they also reduce pain signals. Two antiarrhythmics are used
occasionally for chronic pain: mexiletine (Mexitil) and flecainide (Tambocor).
These medications reduce the pain of diabetic neuropathy, post-stroke 
pain, CRPS/RDS, and traumatic nerve injury. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, 
can reduce spontaneous activity in the CNS and is given intravenously for
chronic pain.

Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Topical pain relievers
While no scientific evidence supports the use of OTC topical ointments (lini-
ments), such as Ben-Gay or Tiger Balm, many people believe that stimulating
their sore areas with these ointments relieves their hurting.
Most topical pain relievers are available over the counter. An exception is
Lidoderm, which is a prescribed, transdermal skin patch.
Although side effects of liniments are usually considered minimal, don’t
overuse them. An unusual death of a teenage athlete occurred in 2007
because she used too many liniments, all of which contained methylsalicy-
lates (aspirin). In fact, a variety of liniments contain the same active ingredi-
ent that’s in aspirin. In addition to methylsalicylate, other types of topical
pain relievers include such ingredients as menthol, camphor, eucalyptus 
oil, turpentine oil, and histamine dihydrochloride. Methyl nicotinate is used
in neuropathic pain conditions and CRPS. Capsaicin, the active ingredient in
hot peppers, is a topical treatment for neuropathic pain.
Some topical remedies include aspirin in chloroform or ethyl ether, capsaicin
(Zostrix, Zostrix-HP), and EMLA (a mixture of local anesthetics) cream. 
Local anesthetics, such as the lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm), are topical
treatments for neuropathic pain.
Lidoderm 5% (lidocaine) patches have been approved by the FDA to treat
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Some people use Lidoderm in an off-label use
for arthritic pain.
Other medications
Other medications are sometimes used to treat chronic pain. They include
 Anti-hypertensive medications: Some medications for high blood pres-
sure (hypertension) can also relieve chronic pain; for example, clonidine
(Catapres, Catapres-TTS patch) relieves the symptoms of complex
regional pain syndrome /reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
 Botulinum toxin: Botox is a popular wrinkle reducer that acts by tem-
porarily paralyzing muscles. You may have heard of this drug as some-
thing celebrities take to get rid of their facial wrinkles in their attempts
to attain endless youth, but that’s not its only use! This effect can also
work for pain control. Botulinum toxin (Botox and Myobloc) can calm
overactive muscles and can soothe chronic headaches and muscle 
pain. Side effects are rare. Botulinum also has direct effects in reducing
skin neurotransmitters that transmit pain.
171
Chapter 14: Prescribing Medicines for Chronic Pain

 Implanted drug-delivery systems: Some pain relievers such as
Ziconotide (Prialt) are administered directly to the area around the
spinal cord and to nerve roots. This method can have benefits such as
reduced dosages and fewer side effects. For some people with severe
injuries, this system is the best way they can take pain medications.
 NMDA inhibitors: Drugs called NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) inhibitors
are now being tested to relieve neuropathic pain. The hope is that they
can stop acute pain from turning into chronic pain by arresting central
sensitization (see Chapter 2).
Working with Your Doctor to Find 
the Right Medication Combo
All medications — including over-the-counter drugs or nutritional and herbal
supplements — can act together and cause harmful side effects. It’s very
important to tell your doctor about everything you’re taking, both for your
pain and for other medical conditions, even if you don’t regard them as 
medication. See Chapter 17 for a personal medication log that you can copy
and use to make a comprehensive list. Your list should include supplements
and vitamins you purchase without a prescription, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, and recreational drugs.
Take all your current medication bottles (or a complete list) with you to all
doctor appointments and be honest about any other substances you’re using.
Even over-the-counter and herbal medications can have serious interactions
with your prescription medications and with each other.
Medications differ in how they work and how you should take them. It’s
important to stay on top of the following pointers, adapted in part, from the
National Institutes of Health:
 What type of medication has your doctor prescribed (for example is it 
a painkiller, an NSAID, an antidepressant, an anti-epileptic, or other type
of drug)?
 What’s the dosage of the medication?
 How often should you take it (or do you take it “as needed”)?
 Should you take the medication at bedtime?
 Should you avoid eating anything when taking the medicine, or should
you take it before, with, or after meals?
 Under what conditions should you stop taking the medicine?
172
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

 What should you do if you forget to take the medicine?
 What side effects may you expect, and what should you do if you have 
a problem?
Your doctor will take into account the following when she prescribes your
medications:
 Your medical condition
 Your weight
 Your age
 Other medications you take
Check out Chapter 13 for a list of information you should always have 
with you when you see your doctor — including information about your 
medicines.
173
Chapter 14: Prescribing Medicines for Chronic Pain
Avoiding serotonin syndrome
Many medicines that people with chronic pain
take include serotonin, a brain chemical that
affects both depression and appetite. Not
enough serotonin causes depression, while too
much can cause problems such as confusion,
restlessness, hallucinations, extreme agitation,
fluctuations in blood pressure, increased heart
rate, nausea and vomiting, fever, seizures, and
even coma.
More than 50 frequently used medicines now on
the market can increase your serotonin levels.
The following is a list of drugs that can add to
your serotonin load. Watch for serotonin symp-
toms when you increase your dose of any of
these medicines. This list was developed by the
American Chronic Pain Association:
Antidepressants and anti-anxiety, and certain
sleep medicines, including fluoxetine (Prozac,
Sarafem), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft),
citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro),
trazodone (Desyrel), venlafaxine (Effexor),
duloxetine (Cymbalta) clomipramine (Anafranil),
buspirone (BuSpar), mirtazapine (Remeron),
lithium, St. John’s Wort, phenelzine (Nardil),
tranylcypromine (Parnate), or isocarboxazid
(Marplan)
Antimigraine medicines in either the triptan or
ergot groups, including sumatriptan (Imitrex),
almotriptan (AxertTM), eletriptan (Relpax),
frovatriptan (Frova), naratriptan (Amerge), riza-
triptan (Maxalt), zolmitriptan (Zomig), ergota-
mine/caffeine (Cafergot), or dihydroergotamine
(DHE 45, Migranal)
Diet pills, specifically L-tryptophan (5-HTP),
sibutramine (Meridia), or phentermine
Certain pain medicines, including tramadol
(Ultram), fentanyl (Duragesic patch), pentazocine
(Talwin), duloxetine (Cymbalta), or meperidine
(Demerol)
Certain drugs for nausea,specifically ondansetron
(Zofran), granisetron (Kytril), or metoclopramide
(Reglan)
Cough syrups or cold medicines if they contain
the anti-cough ingredient dextromethorphan
(DM) or linezolid (ZyvoxTM), an antibiotic for
staphylococcus or enterococcus infections

Using Medicines Safely
Your pharmacist can answer many questions you have about your medicine.
A good general rule is to try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same
pharmacy so that your records are in one place. Your pharmacist can keep
track of all your medications and tell you whether a new drug may cause
problems. If you’re not able to use just one pharmacy, keep a record and
show all your pharmacists your list of medicines and over-the-counter drugs.
(See Chapter24 for information on running your list of prescriptions through
a drug interaction database.)
Here are some safety tips for taking pain medications:
 Read and understand the name of the medicine and the directions on
the container. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use
larger type.
 Check that you can open the container; if not, ask the pharmacist 
to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.
 If you have trouble swallowing pills, ask your pharmacist whether 
a liquid medicine is available.
 Don’t chew, break, or crush tablets. The drug may not be effective
(because the active ingredients may not be evenly distributed in 
the pill) or can cause an overdose when crushed or chewed.
 Ask whether the pharmacy has instructions on where to store a 
medicine.
 Make a list of all medicines you take. Keep a copy in your wallet. The list
should include the name of each medicine, the doctor who prescribed 
it, the reason prescribed, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it.
 Read and save all written information that comes with the medicine.
 Take your medicine in the exact amount and at the time your doctor 
prescribes.
 Take your medicine until it’s finished or until your doctor says it’s 
okay to stop.
 Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your 
medicine.
 Do not skip doses of medication or take half doses unless specified by
your prescription.
 Find out whether drinking alcohol while taking your medicines is okay.
Some medicines don’t mix well with alcohol and can make you sick.
Anyone taking opioids or antianxiety drugs should not drink alcohol 
at all.
174
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

 Don’t take other people’s medicines or give yours to anyone else.
 Throw away outdated medicines.
 Make sure that medicines and supplements are out of the reach of 
children as well as adults with dementia problems.
 If you have prescribed narcotics, keep the main supply in a lockbox 
or safe.
Buying Drugs from the Internet
The Internet is home to many legitimate pharmacies, but it’s also a site for 
a growing number of businesses that sell drugs to anyone with a credit card,
regardless of whether he has a prescription.
No accurate figures exist on how many people buy medicines over the Net
without a prescription. But with more sites appearing every week, its fair 
to say that online pharmacies are a growing market. Buying medicines over
the Internet doesn’t guarantee a quality product unless you follow certain
guidelines to protect yourself.
If you decide you want to buy meds through the Internet, take these 
precautions:
 Talk with your doctor and have a physical exam before you get any new
medicine for the first time.
 Use only medicine prescribed by your doctor or another trusted profes-
sional licensed in the United States to write prescriptions for medicine.
 Know your source to make sure that ordering from them is safe. 
Your state board of pharmacy can tell you whether a Web site is a 
state-licensed pharmacy, is in good standing, and is located in the
United States. Find a list of state boards of pharmacy on the National
Association of Boards of pharmacy (NABP) Web site at www.nabp.
info. Internet Web sites that display the NABP seal have been 
checked to ensure that they meet state and federal rules.
Using Alcohol and Recreational Drugs
Alcohol is a recreational drug, but it’s still a drug. Some people use alcohol 
to relieve chronic pain, which can be very dangerous and boost the effect of
some prescription drugs. Chronic alcoholism frequently causes permanent
and serious damage to the liver, greatly complicating the treatment of chronic
pain. Many medications can’t be given to people with damaged livers.
175
Chapter 14: Prescribing Medicines for Chronic Pain

Marijuana is also a drug. Using marijuana for chronic pain relief is controver-
sial. Some states allow the legal use of marijuana for people in pain. But the
federal government continues to threaten physicians with prosecution for
prescribing it (although it has yet to do it). If you drink alcohol, smoke 
marijuana, or take recreational drugs, tell your doctor.
If you live with chronic pain, you may find it easy to fall into medicating your
pain with beer, wine, or hard alcohol. Using alcohol as a pain reliever isn’t a
new phenomenon. Through the generations, people have medicated their
physical and emotional pain with alcohol.
Of course, many people who drink alcohol don’t have a drinking problem, but
for some, drinking to reduce pain can get out of control.
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),
the following four symptoms indicate an abuse problem has developed into an
addiction (also known as dependence) to alcohol:
 Craving: A strong need, or urge, to drink
 Loss of control: Not being able to stop drinking once drinking has begun
 Physical dependence: Withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating,
shakiness, and anxiety after stopping drinking
 Tolerance: The need to drink greater amounts of alcohol to get high
Getting someone to admit he has a problem with alcohol is usually hard.
Denial of the disease among alcoholics is the norm. Doctors use a variety 
of techniques to uncover problem drinking, including:
 Questionnaires (such as the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test)
 Blood tests measuring red blood cell size
 Blood tests measuring a protein called carbohydrate-deficient transferrin
 Tests showing liver damage
 Tests showing decreased testosterone in men
If you have an alcohol-related problem, draw upon the many national and
local resources available. The National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral
Routing Service offers advice via a toll-free telephone number, 800-662-HELP
(4357). You or your loved one can speak directly to a representative about
treatment, request printed material on alcohol or other drugs, or get 
information about programs in your state.
Many people find help through Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) support groups.
AA groups meet in almost every community. Contact a nearby central 
office to find times and places of local meetings. Their phone numbers and
addresses are listed in local phone directories or go to www.alcoholics-
anonymous.org.
176
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Facing Prescription Drug Abuse
Prescription painkillers can be effective when supervised by a physician to
manage pain. On occasion, though, they can lead to an addiction if they’re
not managed appropriately by your doctor.
Never take more medications than your doctor ordered. Don’t assume that 
if one pain pill helps, then two (or more!) would be even better. Not true! This
dangerous belief can lead to bad side effects and a drug dependence. If your
pain isn’t sufficiently relieved by the dosage your doctor ordered, call her.
Maybe you need a different medication.
Prescription drug abuse is a major problem in the United States. According 
to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.4 million Americans
aged 12 and older used prescription medications for nonmedical purposes 
in the prior 30 days. Of these individuals, an estimated 4.7 million used pain
relievers, 1.8 million used tranquilizers, 1.1 million used stimulants, and
272,000 used sedatives.
Based on a survey of hospital emergency rooms, the Drug Abuse Warning
Network (DAWN) reports that two of the most frequently abused types of 
prescription medications are benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs such as
Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, and Ativan) and opioid pain relievers (such as 
oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, methadone, and combinations includ-
ing these drugs). Stimulants such as methamphetamine, Ritalin, or Adderall
represent another class of commonly abused medications.
Many people with chronic pain use their medications responsibly and 
don’t become addicted to them. Those who do become addicted to drugs 
are usually either seeking a euphoric high or to blot out awareness of their
problems or responsibilities. In other words, they’re not taking drugs for
pain, but for other reasons. In reality, strong painkillers are sometimes
needed for severe pain, and as long as you work with a good doctor who
manages your medications, you usually don’t have to worry about becoming
a drug addict.
In order to provide appropriate and legitimate monitoring of patients taking
opioids, many physicians perform random urine drug tests on their patients
to make sure that they’re taking the narcotic as prescribed.

to Pain Management
In This Chapter
 Discovering the difference between complementary and conventional medicine
 Checking out the major CAM (complementary and alternative) therapies
 Distinguishing between CAMs that are proven or unproven
 Exploring how to detect unproven remedies
C
AM is hot. In the United States, more than a third of all adults use 
some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). When
megavitamin therapy and prayer practiced specifically for health reasons 
are included in the definition of CAM, the percentage rises to a startling 
62 percent. That’s nearly two-thirds of the adults in America.
Exploring CAM
CAM is an umbrella term for health practices outside conventional medicine.
(Conventional medicine is the discipline practiced by medical doctors or 
doctors of osteopathy and related health professionals, such as physical
therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses.)
Complementary medicine is often used alongside conventional medicine. 
For example, if you have chronic pain from arthritis, you may use two com-
plementary therapies (massage and exercise) along with physical therapy
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed by a doctor 
to treat arthritis pain. And scientists have found that the vitamin folic acid
prevents certain birth defects. In addition, a regimen of vitamins and zinc can
slow the progression of the eye disease age-related macular degeneration.
Some health-care providers practice integrative medicine (or integrated 
medicine), which is simply both CAM and conventional medicine.

However, one big concern with CAM is that many of its techniques have not
been researched and, therefore, don’t have science-based credibility. As a
consequence, many practitioners of conventional medicine are dubious
about using CAM to treat diseases and pain.
Sometimes people use alternative medicine instead of conventional medicine,
which can be a very perilous choice. An example of such danger is using
nutritional supplements to treat cancer instead of undergoing the surgery,
radiation, or chemotherapy your doctor recommends. This idea is bad
because it can kill you! Check out Chapter 26, which covers bogus “cures.”
Using Dietary and Herbal Supplements
Many people who suffer from relentless pain take dietary supplements to
boost their general health and feel better. Supplements are highly refined
chemicals or plant extracts just like medicines, but supplements haven’t
been tested for long-term or short-term side effects, interactions with other
medications or other supplements, or safety in people with serious medical
conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, and liver or kidney failure. 
Dietary supplements are sold in grocery, health-food, drug, and discount
stores, as well as through mail-order catalogs, TV programs, the Internet, 
and direct sales.
180
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 
Does CAM really work?
Medical professionals in pain management have
become increasingly interested in CAM. For
example, when talking about acupuncture, one
of your authors, Dr. Kassan, has treated people
with chronic pain for years, and he says of CAM,
“It’s almost mainstream now. As a result, CAM is
safe when done properly and can be very help-
ful for pain.”
Another of your authors, Dr. Vierck, has spent 
40-plus years as a scientist studying pain. He
swears by magnets (for giving him relief for the
arthritis in his wrist, even though the relief he
experiences may be a placebo effect. A placebo
effect is when a useless remedy works because
you think it’ll work. Actually, it does nothing.)
Finally, your third author, Dr. Vierck’s sister,
Elizabeth Vierck, an experienced information
specialist and health writer, says, “My brother’s
caught up in wishful thinking because he 
doesn’t want to give up golf. Magnets are a 
lot of hooey.”
But, and this is a big but, Ms. Vierck herself
takes a dietary supplement twice a day, 
hoping it’ll help her arthritis. So who’s thinking
wishfully?
Of course, you can make up your own mind
about CAM. In many cases, the only harm it can
do is to your pocket book, as long as you’re well
informed and avoid any approaches that may be
harmful.

Some supplements act like medicines and can be harmful, depending on what
other supplements you take, how much of the supplement you take, and how
often you take it. In fact, 17 known supplements cause kidney dysfunction or
failure, and several other dietary substances are known to cause toxicity to
genes and possibly produce cancer, but lack of regulation prevents labeling
of these supplements. In addition, if you take prescribed medicines, too,
these drugs should be taken into account before you add any supplements to
your anti-pain regimen.
Staying safe with dietary supplements
Keep the following safety points about dietary supplements in mind. 
They were adapted from information provided by the National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).
 Some ingredients of supplements, including nutrients and plant 
components, can be toxic. Don’t substitute a dietary supplement for a
prescription medicine or therapy without talking such a change over
with your doctor.
 Tell your health-care providers about complementary and alternative
practices you use so that they have a full picture of how you try to
manage your health. Better yet, tell them before you start using any 
supplements.
 Don’t take a higher dose of a supplement than listed on the label, unless
your health-care provider advises you to do so.
 If you experience any side effects that concern you, stop taking the 
supplement and contact your doctor. You can also report your experi-
ence to the FDA’s MedWatch program (www.fda.gov/medwatch),
which tracks consumer safety reports on supplements.
181
Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management
The law and dietary supplements
Dietary supplements were defined in a law
passed by Congress in 1994. A dietary supple-
ment must meet all the following conditions:
 It’s a product (other than tobacco) intended
to supplement the diet and contains one or
more of the following: vitamins, minerals,
herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, or
any combination of the above ingredients.
 It’s taken in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel,
gelcap, or liquid form.
 It’s not represented for use as a conven-
tional food or as a sole item of a meal or 
the diet.
 It’s labeled as a dietary supplement.

It’s especially important to talk to your provider if you’re using supplements
and meet any of these conditions:
 You’re thinking about replacing your regular medical care with one or
more supplements.
 You’re taking any medications (whether prescription or over the
counter). Some supplements interact with medications.
 You have a chronic medical condition, such as diabetes or arthritis.
 You plan to have surgery. Certain supplements may increase the risk of
bleeding or affect anesthetics and painkillers.
 You’re pregnant or nursing, or you’re considering giving a child a dietary
supplement. Supplements can act like drugs, and many have not been
tested in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children.
Understanding how dietary 
supplements are regulated
The federal government regulates supplements through the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). Currently, the FDA regulates supplements as
foods rather than drugs. In general, the laws about putting foods (including
supplements) on the market and keeping them on the market are less strict
than the laws for drugs.
However, in 2007 the FDA printed a rule requiring manufacturers to evaluate
the identity, purity, strength, and composition of their dietary supplements. 
If dietary supplements contain contaminants or do not contain the dietary
ingredient they are represented to contain, FDA would consider those 
products to be adulterated or misbranded. This is a step — albeit a small 
one — in the right direction for consumers.
Research to prove a supplement’s safety for human consumption is not
required before the supplement is marketed, as it is with over-the-counter or
prescribed drugs. In addition, the supplement manufacturer doesn’t have to
prove the product is effective, nor must he prove supplement quality. For
example, one study that analyzed 59 preparations of Echinacea found that
about half did not contain the items listed on the label.
Glucosamine and chondroitin
Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are popular (and controversial) 
supplements heavily marketed as effective at preventing and treating the
damage that arthritis and sports injuries can do to your joints.
182
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Both substances are naturally present in your body. Glucosamine is a form 
of an amino sugar, and chondroitin is part of a protein. They’re the building
blocks that your body uses to build cartilage. The theory behind using the
supplement is that the more building blocks you have, the more cartilage
you’ll maintain.
The glucosamine you buy in supplements comes from seashells, while 
chondroitin is derived from animal cartilage. These two supplements are
packaged as individual supplements or combined with each other. They’re
also available in other combinations including MSM (methylsulfonylmethane)
as a third ingredient.
A large study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health looked 
at the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin, the COX-2 inhibitor,
Celexecob, and a placebo. (See Chapter 14 for information on COX-2
inhibitors.) The result was that the group of participants as a whole showed
no significant differences between any of them. However, for a small group of
participants with moderate to severe (rather than mild) pain, glucosamine
combined with chondroitin sulfate provided significant pain relief compared
with a placebo.
But don’t get too enthusiastic about glucosamine and chondroitin.
Researchers warn that because of the small size of the group that received
the benefit, these results must be backed up by more research.
What’s the downside of these supplements? They both may cause gas 
and diarrhea.

Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management
Mixing supplements and herbs with medications
Some supplements and herbs can cause seri-
ous harm when combined with prescription
drugs or other substances. For example, St.
John’s Wort can increase the effects of some
prescription drugs used to treat depression or
cause side effects when used with other anti-
depressants. It can also interfere with drugs
used to treat HIV infection or cancer. But you
won’t have to worry as long as you tell your
doctor about the herbs and supplements that
you take — or plan to take.
Ginseng is an herb that can increase the stimu-
lant effects of caffeine (as in coffee, tea, and
cola). It can also lower your blood sugar levels,
creating the possibility of problems when used
alongside diabetes drugs.
Ginkgo biloba, another herb, should never be
taken with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs
because it can increase the risk of bleeding.
Ginkgo may also interact with some psychiatric
drugs and with drugs that affect blood sugar
levels.

SAMe
The supplement S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAMe, for short, pronounced
“Sammy’) is almost as popular as glucosamine and chondroitin, described 
in the preceding section. This substance is naturally found in all the cells 
of your body, and it affects cartilage building and other physical processes.
Supplemental SAMe is marketed as a pain reliever and an antidepressant.
Research supports a possible benefit for depression and pain relief of
osteoarthritis.
SAMe appears to be safe and may have fewer side effects than other pain
relievers. But, long-term side effects and toxicity studies have not been con-
ducted. In high doses, it may cause mild diarrhea, nausea, gas, and anxiety.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Omega-3 fatty acids are best known for preventing heart disease. However,
one way in which they benefit your heart is through their important role 
as an inflammation fighter. As they reduce inflammation, they also reduce
pain associated with it. Several studies demonstrate reductions in joint pain
when taking omega 3-fatty acids.
Omega-3 fatty acids are found naturally in fatty, cold-water fish, dark 
green leafy vegetables, flaxseed oils, and some vegetable oils. Many types 
of supplements with omega-3 fatty acids are available in pill or capsule form.
Fish oil is more beneficial than flaxseed oil.
High dosages of fish oil can cause thinning of the blood, and you can also
have burps that taste like fish oil. Not a pleasant experience.
Herbal supplements
Herbal supplements are a type of dietary supplement. They’re made up of a
single herb or a mixture of herbs. An herb (also called a botanical) is a plant
or plant part used for its scent, flavor, and/or therapeutic properties. Many
herbs have a long history of use and of claimed health benefits.
Just because an herbal supplement is labeled natural doesn’t mean it’s 
good for you or safe to use. Herbal supplements can act the same way as
drugs. After all, poison ivy is natural, too! Herbal remedies can cause medical
problems if used incorrectly or taken in large amounts. Because there is
rarely any quality assurance testing done on these products, knowing the
content of these supplements is impossible. In general, it’s safer to utilize
products from major manufacturers and to avoid products made in China due
to contamination with lead and mercury.
184
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

If you look for supplements to ease your chronic pain, there’s a good chance
that you’ll also run into advertising for the following herbs. Marketers may
claim they can cure your arthritis or prevent your headaches. Here’s the real
deal on many popular herbal supplements.
 Aloe vera: This plant is used for conditions such as asthma and 
arthritis. It’s sold as ointments, lotions, and pills. Studies show that 
topical aloe gel may help heal burns and abrasions. Not enough 
scientific evidence supports aloe vera for any other use.
Aloe vera used topically (on the skin) doesn’t have side effects. Taken
orally, however, aloe vera can cause diarrhea and cramping. Also, if 
you have diabetes, check with your doctor before taking aloe vera
because it may decrease blood glucose levels.
 Black cohosh: Black cohosh purportedly treats arthritis, muscle pain,
menstrual problems, and menopausal symptoms. No scientific studies
have found that taking black cohosh is beneficial for any medical use.
Side effects can include headaches, stomach discomfort, pain, and 
serious liver damage.
 Cat’s claw: Cat’s claw is used to treat cancer, arthritis, and other condi-
tions. No scientific studies have found that taking cat’s claw is beneficial
for any medical use. If you have a compromised immune system or you
may become pregnant (or you are pregnant), stay away from cat’s claw.
 Evening primrose oil (EPO): Evening primrose oil is a fatty acid used for
chronic skin conditions and a variety of other health problems, includ-
ing rheumatoid arthritis. Evening primrose oil may have some benefits
for skin conditions. However, no scientific studies have found that taking
EPO is beneficial for any other medical use. Side effects are mild and can
include stomach problems and headaches.
 Feverfew: Feverfew is purported to help with fevers, headaches, and
rheumatoid arthritis. This herb may help prevent headaches, although
more research is needed. However, insufficient scientific evidence 
makes it impossible to say that feverfew is helpful for any other medical
condition. Feverfew can cause a variety of unpleasant side effects in
your mouth, such as inflammation and canker sores. If you may become
pregnant (or are pregnant) avoid feverfew, as it can cause miscarriage.
 Ginger: Ginger is used to treat stomachaches, nausea, and diarrhea, 
as well as arthritis-related conditions. It may also help relieve nausea.
(An old remedy for upset stomach used to be ginger ale — when it 
actually had ginger in it!) Not enough research has been done to deter-
mine whether ginger is effective in treating other health conditions. No
serious side effects for ginger have been found. Consuming too much,
however, can cause indigestion. Animal studies have shown ginger 
to be protective against liver toxicity produced by acetaminophen, a
commonly used pain medicine.
185
Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management

 Ginkgo biloba (Gingko): Ginkgo is purported to help leg pain caused 
by poor circulation (claudication), multiple sclerosis, and ringing of the
ears. Gingko has shown promising results for claudication.
The flip side of its benefit for claudication is that ginkgo has also been
associated with bleeding problems, headaches, skin reactions, and other
problems.
 Kava Kava (Kava): Kava contains kavalactones, which have calming 
and sedative effects. Many people with pain have tried kava for anxiety
and/or sleep problems.
The U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have warned that kava can
cause serious liver damage. Stay away from it.
 Peppermint oil: Peppermint oil allegedly helps indigestion, irritable
bowel syndrome, and muscle and nerve pain. Peppermint oil may 
help with the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, but no scientific
evidence suggests that it’s beneficial for other health problems.
Peppermint oil should be used in small dosages. It can cause heartburn.
 St. John’s Wort: St. John’s Wort allegedly helps with depression, nerve
pain, and sleep problems. Depression and sleep problems often result
from chronic pain. Some scientific evidence suggests that St. John’s 
Wort can help people with mild to moderate depression. However, two
large studies showed that the herb wasn’t effective in treating major
depression.
St. John’s Wort has a number of serious side effects and should be 
used only with caution and under a doctor’s supervision. It may cause
sensitivity to sunlight, anxiety, dry mouth, dizziness, gastrointestinal
symptoms, fatigue, headache, or sexual dysfunction. St. John’s Wort can
also interact with other drugs. When combined with certain antidepres-
sants, St. John’s Wort may increase side effects, such as nausea, anxiety,
headache, and confusion. According to the NCCAM, other drugs that can
be adversely affected by St. John’s Wort include
• Indinavir and possibly other drugs used to control HIV infection
• Irinotecan and possibly other drugs used to treat cancer
• Cyclosporine, which prevents the body from rejecting transplanted
organs
• Digoxin, which strengthens heart muscle contractions
• Warfarin and related anticoagulants
• Birth control pills
• Some antidepressants
186
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

 Turmeric (Indian saffron): Turmeric purportedly helps a range of
diverse conditions, such as indigestion, liver disease, cancer, and inflam-
mation. It’s sometimes tried as a painkiller and as a topical remedy for
eczema and wounds. Very little scientific research on turmeric has been
done. However, turmeric is considered safe for most adults. It has been
demonstrated to be ineffective in irritable bowel syndrome.
 Valerian: Although valerian is sold as a sleep aid, research has not
shown it to effective for this use. And not enough research has been
done to know whether it works for headaches, anxiety, or other condi-
tions. Valerian can cause mild side effects, such as a hungover feeling
the day after taking it.
Getting Back to Nature: 
Naturopathic Medicine
The premise behind naturopathy is that your body has natural healing 
power that establishes, maintains, and restores health. Practitioners work
with you to support this power through treatments (such as nutrition and
lifestyle counseling), dietary supplements, medicinal plants, exercise, 
and homeopathy.
Naturopathic physicians are trained in clinical nutrition, botanical medicine,
homeopathic medicine, physical medicine (therapeutic manipulation of 
muscles, bones, and spine), Oriental medicine (acupuncture), natural 
childbirth care, psychological medicine, and minor surgery.
Naturopathy appears safe, especially if used as complementary medicine, but
the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)
offers several important qualifying points:
 Naturopathy isn’t a complete substitute for conventional medical care.
 Some therapies used in naturopathy, may be harmful if they’re not used
properly or under the direction of a trained practitioner. For example,
restrictive or other unconventional diets can be unsafe for some people.
 Some practitioners of naturopathy don’t recommend using all or some
of the childhood vaccinations that are standard practice in conventional
medicine.
 The education and training of practitioners of naturopathy vary widely.
Naturopathic physicians may not be licensed to practice in all states,
and in some states, the profession is completely unregulated.
187
Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management

 Naturopathy as a whole medical system is challenging to study. Rigorous
research on this whole medical system is taking place, but it’s at an 
early stage. 
 Naturopathic physicians are trained to know that herbs and some
dietary supplements can potentially interact with drugs and to avoid
those combinations. To do so, they need to be informed of all drugs
(whether prescription or over the counter) and supplements that you
are taking.
The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (www.naturopathic.
org) has a searchable database for finding naturopathic doctors in your area.
Curing Like with Like: Homeopathy
Homeopathic medicine is built around the belief that “like cures like.”
Practitioners mix small, highly diluted amounts of substances to cure 
symptoms. If these substances were given at higher or more concentrated
doses, they would actually cause those same symptoms.
The term homeopathy was coined by the German physician Christian
Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann in 1807. Despite being derided by scientists
from the 19th century to the present, homeopathy has become increasingly
popular in recent years. Almost a fourth of all allergy/cold medicines
launched in the United States in recent years have been homeopathic 
remedies.
Homeopathic medicines widely used for pain include arnica (mountain daisy,
hypericum (St. John’s Wort), urtica urens (stinging nettle), ledum (marsh tea)
rhus tox (poison ivy) ruta (rue) symphytum (comfrey), and calendula
(marigold).
The FDA says homeopathic products are safe because they have little or no
pharmacologically active ingredients.
Homeopathic substances contain no detectable ingredients apart from 
the water or other liquid used to dilute them. Therefore, critics believe that
there’s no known basis for them to heal. Although some patients report 
benefits from homeopathic preparations, the large majority of scientists
attribute this to the placebo effect. This view was supported by a large
review published in the British medical journal The Lancet in August 2005.

Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Assessing Complementary and
Alternative Treatments
CAM covers a broad range of medical practices from acupuncture to 
magnets. We can’t cover them all in this chapter, but we do highlight major
CAM treatments that may help you with your pain management.
Getting the point about acupuncture
Acupuncture is a strange concept: Someone sticks needles into you to reduce
your pain. The method most widely identified with acupuncture involves pen-
etrating the skin with very thin, solid, metallic needles that are then moved
by hand or electrical stimulation. The process is not particularly painful — 
it just feels like a small prick.
Acupuncture is based on the belief that health is determined by a flow of life
energy, called qi (also spelled ki or chi and pronounced chee). Qi is believed
to travel through your body along four invisible paths called meridians.
The belief is that diet, stress, and many other things block these meridians.
When the meridians become blocked, your energy flow becomes unstable,
causing injury and disease. To regain balance, acupuncturists stimulate 
certain points, called acupoints, along meridians. (See Figure 15-1 for a view 
of meridians and their corresponding acupuncture points.)
Others who reject the meridian-blocking idea still support acupuncture
because they believe it stimulates the production of endorphins, or pain-
killing neurochemicals. But whether it’s ancient Chinese beliefs or modern
science that’s right, the point is that acupuncture may help a person in 
pain, which may be you!
Dr. Kassan says, “Rheumatologists see a lot of patients with problems we
can’t do anything about, especially chronic pain. We become very frustrated.
And this is where acupuncture makes its greatest impact: with patients who
have failed conventional treatment.”
According to the National Institutes of Health, new research and a lot of 
anecdotal information have shown that acupuncture can be therapeutic for
specific and very different conditions, including addiction, stroke rehabilita-
tion, osteoarthritis of the knee, headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow,
fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, low-back pain, carpal tunnel
syndrome, and asthma.
189
Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management

Acupuncture is generally safe and won’t harm you unless you use it to
replace necessary medical treatment. However, be sure to select a 
reputable acupuncturist.
Many medical doctors are trained in acupuncture. About 40 states have
established training standards for acupuncture certification, but they 
have varied requirements for obtaining a license to practice acupuncture.
Two organizations provide searchable databases to help you find a practi-
tioner certified in acupuncture: The National Certification Commission 
for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (www.nccaom.org/find.htm) 
and the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (www.medicalacu
puncture.org).
Figure 15-1:
Acupuncture
meridians.
190
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Don’t rely on a diagnosis of disease by an acupuncture practitioner who
doesn’t have substantial conventional medical training.
Although acupuncture is usually safe, be sure to go to a practitioner who is
diligent about sterilizing needles or who uses disposable ones. Possible dan-
gers with reused needles are infection, nerve damage, and punctured organs.
Acupressure uses the same basic concepts as acupuncture, only without the
needles. Putting pressure on the acupoints with your hands, feet, or knees is
a form of massage known as acupressure or shiatsu. You can perform acu-
pressure on yourself, or a loved one can learn the basics.
Calming down with biofeedback
Biofeedback uses your mind to control your body. It’s a technique in which
you use equipment to measure your brain activity, breathing, heart rate,
blood pressure, skin temperature, and/or muscle tension (see Figure 15-2). 
By watching these measurements, you can find out how to change them by
relaxing or holding pleasant images in your mind. Some psychologists and
other therapists use biofeedback with reportedly good results.
During a biofeedback session, a trained practitioner monitors your heart
rate, blood pressure, and skin temperature using electrical sensors. The 
sensors measure your body’s response to stress and feed the information
back to you on the monitor or through auditory cues.
Through biofeedback, you discover how to associate your pain with physical
habits, such as muscles tensing or holding your breath. For example, you
may figure out that your headaches come from tensed muscles.
You then discover how to relax specific muscles to prevent or stop your
headaches. The goal is to produce these responses on your own without 
the help of technology.
The Biofeedback Certification Institute of America (BCIA) has a searchable
database at www.resourcenter.net that you can use to find a qualified
biofeedback therapist.
Although biofeedback is considered safe, talk to your doctor if you or a 
loved one has depression, severe psychosis, diabetes, or other endocrine 
disorders before using biofeedback.

Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management

Boning up on osteopathy
Osteopathy focuses on diseases that begin in the musculoskeletal system. 
The theory behind osteopathy is that all the body’s systems work together,
and instability in one system causes instability and pain in other parts of 
the body. Some osteopathic physicians practice osteopathic manipulation 
to reduce pain, restore function, and promote health and well-being.
Osteopaths focus on joint, muscle, and nerve problems, such as back, 
neck, and head pain.

192
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Osteopathy emphasizes a holistic approach to medicine and the use of a
range of manual and physical therapies. The goal of the osteopathic physician
is to boost the body’s own recuperative powers by treating musculoskeletal 
or other types of dysfunction. A doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) inspects your
posture, how you walk, and how you sit. The D.O. also checks to see whether
your joints can move through their full range of motion and also looks at 
your body’s symmetry.
Manipulating the spine, arms, and legs doesn’t help every medical condition.
However, because of their training, D.O.s can also treat conditions in 
conventional ways when appropriate.
A D.O. is also licensed to perform surgery and prescribe medication. Like an
M.D., an osteopath completes four years of medical school, can practice in
any specialty of medicine, and is licensed by the state. However, osteopaths
receive an additional 300 to 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual 
medicine and the body’s musculoskeletal system.
Osteopaths who want to specialize can become board certified by complet-
ing a two- to six-year residency within the specialty area and passing the
board certification exams.
The American Academy of Osteopathy (www.academyofosteopathy.org)
has a searchable database you can use to find a D.O. near you.
Getting cracking with chiropractic care
Chiropractic is a medical system that focuses on the relationship between
your body’s structures (primarily the spine) and how they function and 
how that relationship affects health. The goal of chiropractic is to normalize
the relationship between your body’s structure and function when it’s out 
of whack.
Chiropractic professionals are doctors of chiropractic, or D.C.s. Chiropractors
complete a four-year course in a chiropractic college, and must pass national
and state examinations. Many people visit chiropractors for treatment of low
back pain.
Chiropractic includes spinal manipulation, diet, exercise, X-rays, and other
therapeutic techniques. Spinal manipulation is a method of adjusting the
spinal cord using hand pressure, twists, and turns.
The premise behind chiropractic is that changes in the normal relationships
between the bones of the spine (vertebral bodies) or joints can result in
health problems in other areas of the body; consequently, manipulation of
these areas may correct these changes and improve function.
193
Chapter 15: Taking an Alternative Approach to Pain Management

Some practitioners also believe that abnormal spine or joint positioning 
may cause nerve damage or compression, muscle spasm, soft-tissue adhe-
sions, or the release of toxic chemicals from damaged soft tissues. These 
conditions may be improved with manipulation. Scientific research backing
up these theories is rarely reported in medical journals, although it does
show up in chiropractic journals. Some people report relief from chiropractic
techniques.
The safety of chiropractic is controversial. The most common side effects are
stiffness, headache, and fatigue. Some evidence indicates that chiropractic
can increase the chance of having a stroke. If you’re at high risk for a stroke
or have any of the following risk factors, stay away from manipulation of the
neck: use of oral contraceptives, use of blood thinning medications, or high
blood pressure.
In addition, if you or a loved one has any of the following conditions, be sure
to use caution and talk to your doctor before using chiropractic, because it
may cause bone fractures or nerve damage: a bone infection, cancer involv-
ing the bone, prior vertebral fractures, severe degenerative joint disease
(osteoarthritis), osteoporosis, or ankylosing spondylitis.
Try to find a chiropractor whose practice is limited to conservative treat-
ment of back pain and other musculoskeletal problems. Look for chiroprac-
tors who are members of the American Chiropractic Association (www.
amerchiro.org), or the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Therapists
(www.manipulativetherapy.org).
Getting hip to hypnosis
Hypnosis has been used since ancient times to relax the mind, reduce pain,
and promote health. Hypnosis causes a relaxed state of mind in which the
individual is open to reasonable suggestions. This aspect of the technique
has made it the brunt of many comedy routines and TV dramas.
You can’t be made to do something when under a hypnotic trance that you
wouldn’t do normally. However, you can use the suggestibility caused by 
hypnosis to your physical and mental benefit.
For example, you can work with a trained therapist to find out how to put
yourself into a hypnotic state (see Chapter 21). You may also decide to 
use a therapist on an ongoing basis.
194
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

To treat chronic pain, the therapist gives you suggestions to help reduce 
your perception of pain and relax your tense muscles (which add to the
pain), and so on.
Hypnotherapy has not been studied extensively for safety. The World 
Health Organization cautions that people with psychiatric illnesses, such 
as schizophrenia, manic depression (bipolar disorder), multiple personality
disorder, or antisocial personality disorders, should not use hypnosis.
There’s no national accreditation or licensing for hypnotherapists in the
United States, but many different organizations provide certification for 
hypnosis therapists. One such organization is the National Board for Certified
Clinical Hypnotherapists (www.natboard.com).

Considering Surgery: 
The Last Resort?
In This Chapter
 Opting for surgery
 Choosing the right surgeon
 Identifying different types of surgery used for chronic pain
 Considering surgery when you’re older
 Preparing for surgery
Your chronic pain may be so bad that you’re totally fed up and desperate.
You’d do just about anything to lessen the agony, including letting a sur-
geon cut into you while you’re unconscious. Or maybe your doctor has told
you that you need surgery. Alternatively, perhaps you simply want to know all
your options for managing your pain, including surgical choices. Whatever
led you to reading this chapter, you’re probably approaching the idea of
surgery with considerable trepidation. We don’t know anyone who says,
“Okay, I’ll have surgery. No big deal.” It’s always a big deal.
But for many, surgery actually is a great option that can have stunning
results. One of your authors (Elizabeth Vierck) has had two hip replacement
surgeries, as well as surgery on both feet, all problems caused by arthritis.
She says, “Fifty years ago, I’d be walking with two canes or in a wheelchair by
now. Instead, I walk a few miles on most days, hike in the mountains, bicycle,
and do water exercise four times a week. I’m not pain-free, but have a lot less
pain than before the surgeries, and I’m active, best of all.” A true testimonial
for the surgery choice!

Making the Decision
Most surgeries for pain are elective. In other words, the choice is really up to
you. Surgery for chronic pain is usually not an emergency. Your life isn’t in
danger. You have time to find out as much as possible about the surgery and
the surgeon and to review your options. You also have time to get a second
opinion (or more, if need be). No rush decisions are required, which is good.
All surgery has risks and requires a recovery period ranging from days to
months, depending on the type of procedure and your general health status.
Outcomes can vary considerably, from thrillingly successful to not so great.
One of your authors (Dr. Kassan) cautions, “As a general rule, don’t consider
surgery until you’ve tried all other approaches, including medicines, physical
therapy, and other techniques we discuss in this book. Even then, have
surgery only when you feel that a not-so-great surgical outcome can’t be
worse than the pain you’re in at present.” He also warns, “There is an excep-
tion to this advice: If you have any neurological signs, such as numbness,
weakness, or loss of bowel function, talk to your doctor about these 
symptoms right away.”
You and your primary care doctor should exhaust all other pain-relieving
options before you even consider surgery or meet with a surgeon.
Your primary care physician is usually a good starting point to learn about
surgery. For example, your doctor will know what type of surgery you may
need and which surgeon you should interview for your operation, such as an
orthopedic doctor, neurosurgeon, or general surgeon.
Although your doctor can refer you to a specific surgeon by name, also do
some investigating on your own to make sure that person is a good fit. Before
you meet the surgeon, think about issues you need to discuss:
198
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 
Benefits of surgery for those over age 65
Research conducted by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality has shown
surgery can be a boost to older people in pain. Its
study showed that, despite the risk of complica-
tions, the quality of life improves for older people
after having knee replacement surgery. Older
patients reported less pain and better physical
function after surgery than younger patients.
Additional research confirmed the value of total
knee replacement surgery in a study of patients
whose average age was 65 years. After four
years, nearly 90 percent of patients had a good
to excellent outcome. After five years, 75 percent
had no pain, 20 percent had mild pain, 3.7 percent
had moderate pain, and only 1.3 percent had
severe pain. These are good numbers!

 Does my particular condition respond well to surgery? For example,
surgery for back pain is controversial. Many medical experts suggest
that most back pain will eventually ease up or go away completely with-
out surgery. And some spinal surgeries can lead to other problems, such
as collapsing of the vertebrae above where the surgery was done or
below the area that was operated on. You should discuss these types of
issues with your primary care doctor, as well as the surgeon.
 What results can I expect from surgery? Ask such questions as, “Will
my pain go away entirely?” or “If my pain will only be reduced, about
how much pain will I still have?” or “Will my pain probably be reduced
by 80 percent, 50 percent, 10 percent, or some other percentage?”
 What lies ahead for me if I do not have surgery now? Several things
can happen. If you don’t have surgery, your condition may worsen.
Alternatively, depending on your medical problem, the condition may
improve on its own. Or it may stay about the same. Find out which situa-
tion applies in your case.
 Are there any emerging surgical techniques that may help even more
or that would require less recovery time and may be worth waiting
for a year or two down the road?
 Are there other nonsurgical treatments that I haven’t tried yet to ease
my pain? Besides your doctor’s response, this question also requires an
honest answer from you. For example, have you carried out all the rec-
ommendations of your physical therapist? Do you take your medications
as prescribed and on schedule? Do you control your weight? If not, now
is a good time to start!
Checking Out a Surgeon’s Resume
Two important attributes to look for in a surgeon are specialized training and
a lot of experience. Be sure to find out about your surgeon’s qualifications.
Obtain the following types of information about the surgeon’s credentials and
experience before you sign up to lie down on that operating table:
 Is your surgeon certified by a surgical board approved by the
American Board of Medical Specialties (such as the American Board
of Orthopaedic Surgery, the American Board of Colon and Rectal
Surgery, or another national surgical board)? Board-certified surgeons
have successfully completed training and passed exams for their spe-
cialty. If the surgeon or his group has a Web site, this information is 
usually included there.
199
Chapter 16: Considering Surgery: The Last Resort?

 Does the surgeon have the letters FACS after his name? If so, the
doctor is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. Fellows have
passed a test of their surgical training and skills; they’ve also committed
to high standards of ethical conduct. Doctors with FACS after their name
are proud of this credential and often include the designation after their
name in the Yellow Pages of the phone directory.
 Is the surgeon board certified? Most minimally invasive spine surgeries
for pain control, such as disc decompression or spinal cord stimulation
are performed by board-certified anesthesiologists or physiatrists 
with extra training in pain medicine. These physicians do not have the
FACS designation (see preceding bullet), but have specialized training
specifically in pain medicine, which may include a year of formal 
fellowship training.
 Does the surgeon operate regularly? You’re looking for a surgeon who
operates at least several times a week.
 How many times has he performed the specific surgery you need in
the past year? Studies suggest that surgical outcomes are better when a
surgeon has performed a surgery many times.
So how many is many? We don’t have a definite answer to this question.
As a general rule, your surgeon should perform an operation like yours
at least every few weeks, and much more often would be better.
 Does the surgeon get good reviews from commercial services? Check
out sites such as bestdoctors.com (www.bestdoctors.com) and
healthgrades.com (www.healthgrades.com).
 Does the surgeon practice at a highly reputable, accredited hospital?
You want one that has a Gold Seal of Approval from the accreditation
organization called The Joint Commission (www.qualitycheck.org)
or those who make U.S. News and World Report’s Best Hospitals list
(www.health.usnews.com).
Knowing what to ask the surgeon
Interview at least two surgeons when you’re considering surgery. Remember
the surgeon isn’t going to be your new best friend, so don’t be put off by a
brusque and busy manner. More importantly, does he have a lot of experi-
ence with the surgery you’re considering? In other words, find a surgeon
whose specialty is the specific procedure that you’re going to be having. 
For example, if you’re going to have your neck fused, pick a surgeon who 
performs neck fusions a hundred or more times per year.
Your author, Dr. Kassan, says that the best surgeons are usually the ones who
are busiest. As a result, you may not get into see the surgeon of your choice
right away.
200
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

If you have to wait to see a popular surgeon, ask to be put on the doctor’s
waiting list. Also, ask to be put on the cancellation list in case someone 
cancels her appointment. You may not get much notice, but you also may 
get your appointment much faster.
When you meet the surgeon, ask these questions, recommended by the
National Institutes of Health:
 What type of surgery is recommended?
 Why do I need surgery?
 Can another treatment be tried instead of surgery?
 What if I don’t have the surgery?
 How will the surgery affect my health and lifestyle?
 Are there any activities that I won’t be able to do after surgery?
 How long will it take to recover?
 How much experience has the surgeon had doing this kind of surgery?
 Where will the surgery be done — in the hospital, the doctor’s office, a
special surgical center, or a day surgery unit of a hospital?
 What kind of anesthesia will be used? What are the side effects and risks
of having anesthesia?
 Is there anything else I should know about this surgery?
You may want to create your own list of questions that relate to your specific
case. Write down your concerns before you see the doctor. Ask the most
important questions in case you run out of time — that way, at least the
doctor has addressed those issues. Take notes on what the doctor says, in
case you forget later. (You think you won’t, but sometimes people do!)
Getting a second opinion
Many people worry that if they get a second opinion about surgery, they’ll
hurt their doctor’s delicate feelings. Don’t worry: Second opinions are 
standard medical practice, and getting them gives you several advantages.
They’re a good way to get expert advice from another doctor specializing 
in your particular medical problem. And second opinions can reassure you
that your decision to have surgery is the right one. The opposite can also 
be true; the other doctor may just stop you from having unnecessary surgery.
Medicare, many Medicaid programs, and many private health insurance 
companies help pay for a second opinion.
201
Chapter 16: Considering Surgery: The Last Resort?

When getting another opinion, do the same upfront research that you did 
for the first surgeon and ask the second surgeon the same questions that 
you asked the first one (from the “Making the decision” and “Knowing 
what to ask the surgeon” sections, earlier in this chapter) so that you can
compare answers.
How do second opinions work? If both doctors agree that your surgery is
probably a go, you may choose to go to either doctor for the surgery. If the
second surgeon doesn’t come to the same conclusion as the first, you may
want to see a third surgeon to break the tie. You should also get the opinion
of your primary care doctor.
Before going for a second opinion, have your medical records sent to the
second surgeon so that you won’t have to repeat any tests. Also, if you’ve
had recent X-rays and the evaluating doctor will probably need to see them,
call the clinic (or wherever the X-rays are located) and tell the staff you want
to check out your X-rays. Give them at least a few days notice.
Profiling Major Types of 
Pain-Relieving Surgery
Many conditions cause chronic pain, so many types of surgery are available.
They range from procedures to implant electrical equipment to reduce your
pain to surgery to replace entire joints. In the following sections, we cover
major surgeries performed to relieve pain, but check with your doctor about
specific surgeries available for your particular condition. New surgical proce-
dures and technologies appear all the time; make sure that you’re up on 
the latest and greatest options for your specific condition.
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a nondestructive, surgical approach to
reversible pain relief. This therapy is used to control such chronic pain con-
ditions as neuropathic pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain
syndrome, low back pain, pain that remains after back surgery (failed backs),
and Raynaud’s disease. (Check Part II for information about these condi-
tions.) In fact, SCS is often the last resort for these conditions and provides
welcome relief when all other approaches fail. The success rate for SCS is a
stunning 50 to 70 percent, depending on the cause of pain.
202
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

In SCS, a surgeon installs a little generator and a lead (wire) under your skin.
The generator sends electrical currents through the lead to your spinal cord.
(You’ll probably feel a tingling sensation.) These currents act like a jamming
device. Installing the equipment is usually a simple outpatient procedure, 
and you’ll have a small incision.
Two types of SCS systems are available — one type is placed totally inside
your body, and the other type uses a remote control and sends radio 
frequency signals to communicate with a receiver in the body.
Implantable drug delivery systems
Implantable drug delivery systems send pain-relieving medications, such as
morphine or other drugs, directly to receptors in the spinal cord. A major
advantage is that smaller doses of medication are required to gain relief
because you’re receiving a steady dose.
The system is made up of a pump and catheter (a thin, flexible tube) surgi-
cally implanted under the skin. The pump is inserted just above or below 
the belt line. A catheter runs from the pump to the spinal cord where it 
delivers medication, usually an opioid. The pump releases medication at 
a set rate and eventually expands out and bathes pain receptors all along 
the spinal cord.
Some health problems are particularly amenable to drug delivery systems. 
If you or a loved one has any of the following conditions, implanted drug 
systems may help:
 Failed back surgery syndrome
 Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)
 Chronic abdominal pains
 Failed neck surgery syndrome
Morphine is usually used in implantable drug delivery systems. However,
some people can’t tolerate the side effects of morphine, but may be able to
use other drugs such as Demerol, Dilaudid, methadone, Fentanyl, or sufen-
tanil. (See Chapter 14 for more information on these drugs.) New drugs, such
as Prialt, derived from the toxin of a Pacific cone snail, show promise but are
currently extremely expensive.
If you’ve used an implantable drug delivery system for awhile, you may
develop tolerance to the drug delivered to your spine, or you may develop
another condition that does not respond to opioids. If you have such a
response, your doctor may try other medications such as local anesthetics.
203
Chapter 16: Considering Surgery: The Last Resort?

Nerve blocks
Nerve blocks are injections of an anesthetic into or near a pain-conducting
nerve. The procedure prevents pain signals from reaching the spinal cord or
brain. A local anesthetic temporarily halts the transmission of pain signals in
peripheral nerves.
Nerve blocks can be single injections or continuous infusions. They can
relieve pain temporarily, for a few weeks, or several months.
According to the Cleveland Clinic, nerve blocks may help if you suffer from
any of the following conditions:
 Neck pain
 Low back pain
 Sciatica resulting from herniated discs
 Lumbar canal stenosis
 Complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy)
 Peripheral vascular disease
 Shingles pain
 Myofascial pain syndrome
 Cancer pain
Spinal fusion
Spinal fusion joins together two or more vertebrae with bone grafts, metals
rods, or other hardware. If you have injured your vertebrae, have slipped
discs, or curvatures of the spine, spinal fusion may be an option for you.
The surgery results in limited motion in the area of the fusion and may cause
instability further up and down the spine. If you have spinal fusion surgery,
you may be much more active than in the past, but if you don’t stay in 
condition, you may still have pain.
Facet neurotomy
The purpose of a facet neurotomy is to destroy the root of a spinal nerve that
is causing pain. The procedure is always considered a last resort because it
can cause complete sensory loss to the destroyed nerve and can also lead 
to loss of motor function. However, it can also give major pain relief to 
some patients.
204
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Minimally invasive disc procedures
Small to moderate-sized disc herniations and tears in the discs of the verte-
brae can now be treated in ways that are far less invasive than previous 
surgeries. Many of these procedures are performed by pain medicine 
physicians and include the following:
 Devices such as mechanical instruments, laser tools, coblation tools (a
type of radiofrequency energy), and high-pressure contained water jets
can be used to repair discs. A radiofrequency probe, called an Intradiscal
Electrothermal Therapy (IDET), can be used to repair tears in discs.
 Specialized tools can be inserted through a tube (endoscope) into discs.
Then the tools are used through the scope to make pain-relieving repairs.
Surgery for cervical disc disease
If you have cervical (neck) disc disease, you may want to consider several
surgical options. Cervical disc disease is caused by degeneration of the 
discs in the spine, narrowing of the spinal canal, arthritis, and, in rare cases,
cancer or meningitis. Symptoms of the condition include pain in your neck 
or shoulder, tingling and numbness in your arms, and weakness in your 
arms or hands.
Several surgical procedures can relieve cervical pain. According to the
American Association of Neurological Surgeons, they include
 Anterior cervical discectomy (ACD): ACD is widely performed to treat
chronic neck pain. A disc (or discs) and bone spurs are removed from
neck vertebrae. The surgery relieves pressure on one or more nerve
roots or on the spinal cord.
 Anterior cervical corpectomy: This operation is performed together
with anterior cervical discectomy. One or more parts of your vertebrae
are removed, and then the space between the vertebrae is fused.
 Posterior microdiscectomy: This procedure is performed for a bulging
disc on the side of the spinal cord. The surgeon carefully moves a nerve
root to the side to free the offending disc.
 Posterior cervical laminectomy: In this procedure the surgeon uses 
a small incision in the middle of your neck to remove bone spurs or 
disc material.
205
Chapter 16: Considering Surgery: The Last Resort?

Joint replacement
Some readers may remember an old ’70s television show, “The Bionic
Woman”, in which many body parts of the injured Jaime Sommers were
replaced, giving her incredible speed and mobility. Some people with joint
replacement consider themselves bionic. Of course, joint replacement 
won’t enable you to run so fast that people can’t even see you, but it can
often enable you to walk without pain once you recover, which sounds 
pretty good to people suffering from severe joint pain.
Joint replacement is the removal of a diseased joint and its replacement with
an artificial one, called a prosthesis. The medical term for the procedure is
arthroplasty. Over the last couple of decades, tremendous advances have
been made in arthroplasty for knees and hips. The following are the most 
frequently performed joint replacements.
 Hip replacement surgery is one of the most successful orthopedic 
surgeries. It’s evolving from a major surgery with a long recovery time 
to a less invasive procedure with a faster return to normal functioning.
Regardless of the technique used, the process involves taking out dis-
eased parts of the joint — the femur and acetebellum — and replacing
them with artificial parts that allow smooth motion of the hip.
If you have hip replacement surgery, you and your surgeon will decide
whether your new hip will be fastened to your healthy bone using
cement or something called biologic fixation, which involves giving your
bone time to actually grow into the prosthesis. Your surgeon may also
want to use a combination of methods. The advantage of cemented
replacements is that you can go back to your normal activities soon
after surgery.
 Hip resurfacing is a newer technique that enables the surgeon to
remove less bone during a total hip replacement procedure. The femoral
head, neck, and femur remain in your joint, allowing preservation of as
much of the hip as possible. Resurfacing keeps a large portion of the hip
joint intact for you to have total hip replacement surgery at a later date
if needed.
 During knee replacement surgery, damaged bone and cartilage are
taken from your thighbone, shinbone, and kneecap, and the areas are
then reshaped. The surgeon inserts an artificial joint (prosthesis). As
with hip replacement surgeries, knee replacements have benefited from
new, minimally invasive surgical techniques. The procedure can be 
performed without large incisions, allowing for a quicker recovery than
in the past. It also means you’ll have less scar tissue.
206
Part III: Managing Your Pain Medically 

Recovering from Surgery
When you know in advance what to expect after surgery, you’ll be less scared
and more able to plan ahead for a successful recovery. Knowledge is power!
Ask your surgeon how long you’ll be in the hospital and find out what kind 
of supplies and equipment you’ll need when you go home. Also ask your 
surgeon how much post-operative pain to expect and what kinds of activities
you’ll be able to do after surgery. For example, ask when you can take daily
walks around the block again or when you can lift your 25-pound grandchild
again safely.
Also, ask how long it will be before you can go back to work or start regular
exercise. Find out whether you’ll need any special equipment when you
return to work. You don’t want to do anything that will slow down your recov-
ery! If you have other types of chronic pain in addition to the reason why
you’re having surgery, tell your surgeon and the health professionals helping
you with rehabilitation. For example, not being able to perform physical ther-
apy exercises after surgery may greatly impact your recovery.
207
Chapter 16: Considering Surgery: The Last Resort?
Preparing for surgery if you have fibromyalgia
If you’re having a major surgical procedure and
you also have fibromyalgia or a similar chronic
disease, talk with your surgeon and anesthesiol-
ogist about techniques to help you reduce a 
flare up of symptoms that often occurs after
surgery. These techniques are adapted from
materials developed by the Oregon Fibromyalgia
Foundation (www.myalgia.com).
 If you’ll have an endotracheal tube during
surgery, ask for a soft neck collar to 
wear during surgery to minimize neck 
hyperextension.
 Ask that your arm with the intravenous line
be kept near your body, not away from your
body or over your head.
 Request a pre-operative opioid pain medica-
tion that you can take about 90 minutes 
prior to surgery. Pre-operative opioids can
minimize the widespread body pain that
you’re already experiencing due to your
fibro.
 Ask for a long-acting local anesthetic to be
infiltrated into your incision — even though
you’ll be asleep during the procedure. This
anesthetic minimizes pain impulses reach-
ing your spinal cord and brain, which in turn
drive central sensitization.
 You’ll need more post-operative pain med-
ication, and it’ll usually need to be longer-
acting medication. In most cases, opioids
should be regularly administered or self-
administered with a PCA pump (patient-
controlled analgesia).
Most fibromyalgia patients require a longer post-
operative convalescence, including physical
therapy.

When you have surgery, remember that it’s normal to have pain afterward. 
It even has a name: post-surgical pain. It will be awhile before you know how
much pain relief you’re going to have as a result of the surgery because the
post-surgical pain will dominate for awhile. Many people also have pain due
to inflammation and/or muscle spasms after surgery. You’ll also have pain at
the site of the incision and in the area where the operation was performed.
Your body has had a major assault, and these reactions to surgery are all
normal. As your body heals, this discomfort should decrease. If it doesn’t, be
sure to discuss your situation with your surgeon and primary care doctor.

your lifestyle. We show you how to track and manage
that pain and discuss how good nutrition, deconditioning,
and sleep all affect your level of chronic pain.

H
ave you ever been sitting in your doctor’s office when she asks you 
how intense your pain has been, and you suddenly blank out? Maybe
you say, “Uh, maybe a 7 when it started. Oh, maybe a 3 now. Uh, well, okay,
maybe it’s more of a 5,” you stammer. You’re confusing your doctor and
embarrassing yourself, but you can’t help it. This so-called doctor-visit 
amnesia is a common phenomenon. It happens to most of us, so don’t feel
bad. (Just plan ahead, so you can hopefully avoid it!)
Many people grit their teeth, bear the pain, and avoid keeping track of the
details. They don’t remember or have any sort of record of what they were
doing on the day the pain was its worst, nor do they know what was going 
on when the pain started in the first place. But, as the saying goes, the devil
is in the details.
Tracking the minutiae of your individual chronic pain can help you and your
doctor tame that wild demon. For example, if you honestly rate your maxi-
mum pain on a scale of 1 to 10 for a week at the end of every day, you may
find that it is ever-so gradually going down. It may be subtle, but it means
that your treatment is working.
This chapter provides you key suggestions for evaluating the intensity of
your pain and also tracking and managing that pain. If you share this 
information with your loved ones, caregivers, doctors, and other health pro-
fessionals, they’ll better understand the impact your chronic pain has on you
and be more adept at helping you manage it.

Tracking Your Pain
Medical research has shown that if you measure the level of your pain, 
and you also record the location of your pain, how long it lasts, and other
characteristics, such as how it’s affecting your quality of life, you’ll have 
the most reliable gauge of your pain. And this information can really help 
you and your doctor.
The following sections provide you with a wealth of materials you can use to
track your pain and improve its management.
Describing your pain
Are you at a loss for what words to use to describe your pain at its worst?
One reason for your pain amnesia may be that people can’t remember exactly
how pain felt when they feel better again. It’s over, and they know that it hurt,
but they just can’t recollect how it felt. (This is nature’s way of keeping you
sane!) When you’re in severe pain, look at the following list and see which
words best describe your pain so that you can report this information to
your doctor later:
Aching
Burning
Buzzing
Crampy
Crushing
Cutting
Deep
Dull
Electric
Itching
Knot-like

Recording your pain
A pain log can help you identify your particular pain triggers. (Pain triggers
are things in your life — such as too much exercise or too little sleep — that
set off a pain cycle.) When you know what your own personal pain triggers
are, you can deal with them more proactively.
Keeping a pain record can also help you and your doctor assess your pain
and evaluate how well your medications and other treatments are working.
And it can help you keep track of your pain management goals and whether
you’re reaching them. (We discuss goal setting in the “Taking Control”
212
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

section, later in this chapter.) If you suffer from chronic pain, you should be
recording it at regular intervals to track your improvement and how well your
treatments are working, as well as times when you worsen.
Many methods for keeping a record of your pain are available, and we
describe several in the following sections. This way, you have no excuse
because you should be able to work with at least one method here.
For example, if you don’t like to keep handwritten notes, try using a picture
log. Figure 17-1 shows one we really like, developed by the American Chronic
Pain Association. Make copies of the form and then circle the number under
the pictures that most apply to you.
Also consider combining methods — for example, using both this picture
method and the quality of life scales in Figure 17-3.
Keeping a diary
A diary can help you track your pain. A student notebook or a pad of paper
and a folder both work well.
Keep in mind that the more details that you include in your notebook, the
better for you and your doctor.
Be sure to answer these questions in your pain diary:
 Exactly where does it hurt? Is your pain limited to one spot, or does it
move around to other parts of your body?
213
Chapter 17: Tracking and Avoiding Pain Triggers
Detect someone else’s pain with nonverbal cues
If you’re helping another person develop his pain
diary or you want to explain his pain to a health
professional, you may find it difficult to get a true
picture of how he feels. It’s often hard to tell
what’s going on, even when you know someone
is in pain. Sure, he hurts, but how bad is it?
In fact, many people won’t tell you, particularly if
they’re part of an older generation or naturally
stoical. However, people in pain also display non-
verbal clues to how they’re feeling. You can use
these clues developed by the National Institutes
of Health to tell whether someone else is in pain:
 Vocal complaints: Moans, groans, grunts,
cries, gasps, or sighs
 Facial grimaces and winces: Furrowed
brow, narrowed eyes, tightened lips,
dropped jaw, clenched teeth, distorted
expression
 Bracing: Clutching or holding on to things
during movement
 Restlessness: Constant or intermittent shift-
ing of position, rocking, intermittent or con-
stant hand motions, inability to keep still
 Protecting: Clutching or holding the affected
area
 Self soothing: Rubbing and massaging the
affected area of the body

215
Chapter 17: Tracking and Avoiding Pain Triggers

 What does the pain feel like? Is it a stabbing, throbbing, or aching pain,
or would you describe it in another way?
 How strong is the pain? Use a 1 to 10 scale, with 0 for no pain and 10 for
the worst that you can possibly imagine. You may want to use the scale
at the top of Figure 17-1. In addition, the next section, “Using pain scales
to determine pain intensity,” provides the address for a Web site where
you can download and print scales for free.
Do not amplify your pain on the pain scales. For example, a 10 usually
means that the pain sufferer has been in the emergency room getting IV
narcotics. People who say their pain is a 20 are frequently viewed as not
being truthful and are prone to exaggeration, which may negatively
impact pain care. Consider recording a range of daily pain instead of
simply picking a number.
 How frequent are your pain episodes? (For example, are they several
times a day or week or some other frequency?) Do these pain episodes
occur only when you get up in the morning, or whenever you’ve been
resting for awhile? Or is the pain constant and unremitting?
 How long does each pain episode last? Do you have it all the time, on
and off, the same all day long, or is it worse at a particular time?
216
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 
Finding your environmental pain triggers
Some people’s pain worsens when they eat cer-
tain foods or they’re under stress. Others find
weather changes greatly exacerbate their pain.
Heavy lifting can trigger pain in some people.
Some contorted positions (for whatever reason
that you’re contorted!) can zap your body with
pain. Once you’ve identified your environmental
triggers, you can start working on limiting their
effects on your life!
Following are some basic suggestions for limit-
ing some common pain triggers:
 Avoid lifting more than 15 to 20 pounds
whenever possible. Extra weight can trigger
pain in many people.
 Falls can be pain generators, and some
people suffer for years from a seemingly
minor slip and fall. Keep your house and dri-
veway debris-free and watch where you’re
walking (hopefully not into a pothole!) when
away from home. If you have small children
or grandchildren, watch out for the tiny 
items they spread around that are too easy
to trip over.
 When the weather is bad, you can’t some-
how transform a cold, snowy day into a
sunny day at a tropical beach. But you can
dress warmly, be careful, and decrease 
the probability of ratcheting up your pain
quotient.
 Sometimes foods trigger pain. Track what
you eat to find out whether spicy foods, caf-
feinated drinks, milk, or other types of food
put you in Painland, a place where you don’t
want to be. If so, avoid those foods.
 If you’re under a lot of stress, find some de-
stressing activities. Do something fun or just
take a nap — whatever works for you.

 Do you have more than one type of pain? For example, you may have
some constant aches, as well as a shooting pain in your shoulder that
comes and goes.
 What are your pain triggers, if you know? What activities or times of day
seem to set off the pain, make it worse, or make it better? For example,
did you carry a heavy suitcase through the airport yesterday, and now
you’re paying for it with major pain? Did you stop taking a pain medica-
tion? Have you been avoiding exercise or over-exercising? (Yes, some
people do exercise too much and for too long!)
 What pain medications are you taking, and how often do you take them?
 Is the medication giving you pain relief?
 If you get relief from the medication, how long does it last?
 Do you have any other symptoms associated with pain, such as 
sweating, loss of appetite, or insomnia?
Using pain scales to determine pain intensity
Pain scales are frequently used by health-care professionals who work with
people in pain when they need to know how bad it hurts. You may decide to
use a pain scale by itself or along with a diary to describe your pain intensity.
(See the preceding section for more on a pain diary.) The National Institutes
of Health provides free and downloadable pain scales on the following Web
site: http://painconsortium.nih.gov. Click the Other Resources link
and then click Pain Intensity Scales.
The pain scales include the number scale, the visual scale, the categorical
scale, and the pain faces scale. People usually prefer one scale over the other:
 On the number rating scale, you explain how much pain you’re having
by choosing a number from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst possible pain).
 The visual scale is a straight line. The far left equals no pain, and the far
right end equals horrible (the worst) pain. You mark on the line where
your pain is.
 The category scale has four categories: none, mild, moderate, and
severe. You circle the category that best describes their pain.
 The faces scale uses six faces with different expressions of pain on each
face. You choose the face that best describes how you are feeling. This
rating scale is easy to use by people from age 3 and up.
Using body diagrams to show where it hurts
A body diagram to describe where your pain is and whether it moves around
can help your doctor greatly. Copy the body diagram in Figure 17-2. For each
part of your body where you have pain, draw an outline that includes the pain
area on the body diagram. Use different colored pencils or pens to describe
pain that’s inside or outside your body. For example, you can use green if the
pain is inside your head and blue if it’s on the top of your head.
217
Chapter 17: Tracking and Avoiding Pain Triggers

Measuring your quality of life
Chronic pain affects all areas of your life. The staff at the American Chronic
Pain Association say it’s important to look at not just your physical level of
pain, but also how much your pain limits your ability to live a full life. The
organization’s Quality of Life Scale, shown in Figure 17-3, takes into account
your ability to work, enjoy your family, and participate in social activities.
The ACPA suggests that you download the scale, print it, and show it to your
doctor and other members of your medical team.
Taking your pain records to your doctor
After you create a pain diary and other pain tracking records of your choice
(described earlier in the “Tracking Your Pain” section), you can describe 
to your doctor just what your pain is like and how it changes with different
treatments. But how do you relay this information to your doctor during your
15-minute (or less) visit? Creating a summary of all your lists can help you
accurately portray your pain to her. Your summary of all the careful records
you’ve been keeping should make the following points:
 When did the pain start? For example, did it begin suddenly or come on
gradually?

Chapter 17: Tracking and Avoiding Pain Triggers

 How intense is the pain on most days? This point is where the pain scale
in Figure 17-1 that you choose comes in handy.
 Where is the pain on your body? Refer to the body chart shown in 
Figure 17-2, earlier in this chapter.
 What seems to trigger the pain or make it worse?
 What, if anything, makes the pain better?
 Does your pain affect your ability to carry out daily activities?
 Does your pain affect your mood and sense of well-being?
 Do you feel depressed or anxious?
Your doctor will probably ask you about past and present medical problems
or injuries that may have a role in causing or worsening the pain. (For a com-
plete list of the things you should discuss with your doctor, see Chapter 13.)
And, of course, your doctor will give you a physical examination.
Developing a Pain Management Plan
Work with your professional anti-pain team to create your pain management
plan and then be sure to write it down. (For more information on anti-pain
teams, see Chapter 13.) Post your plan somewhere you’ll easily see it, such 
as on your refrigerator or on your nightstand. You also may want to make a
copy of your plan and keep it in your pain diary or folder.
Here’s a list of the type of items to include in your plan:
 Goals: List your goals and update the list regularly. (See the “Getting
smart about goals” section, later in this chapter.)
 Medications: List the medications you take, the dosage for each drug,
and when you take them. You may want to make copies of the medica-
tion log in Figure 17-4 and insert your own medication information. 
(See Chapter 14 for information about the medications frequently used
to manage pain.)
 Pain triggers: List your pain triggers and your strategy for avoiding them.
 Exercise and stretching: List the type of exercises you’re doing and plan
to do. (See Chapter 19 for information about exercise appropriate for
you if you have chronic pain.)
 Rest: Plan to make rest and adequate sleep part of your daily routine.
(See Chapter 20 for information on getting adequate sleep and rest.)
 Other healthy habits: List other healthy habits you’ll practice, such as
maintaining a healthy diet. (We list many throughout this book.)

 Rehabilitation plan: List any special exercises or techniques you’re
using to lessen your pain and build up strength and stamina.
 Contact information for your physical and/or occupational therapist
and pharmacist: Include names, addresses, and phone numbers.
 Contact information for other members of your health-care team such
as your fitness instructor or dietician: Include names, addresses, and
phone numbers.
Taking Control
Once you develop a pain management plan with your doctor and other 
members of your anti-pain team, be sure to use it. A plan that you don’t use
isn’t any good, even if you’ve got the best doctors in the world!
An important part of making the plan work is to focus on your health:
 Take care of yourself by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and
following your pain management plan.
 Be positive and stop negative thinking (see Chapter 21).
 Laugh and smile a lot. (Learn some jokes, read a funny book, or take the
kids to an amusement park; see Chapter 22 for more ideas).
 Surround yourself with positive people.
 Enjoy activities with family and friends.
Getting smart about goals
After you’re keeping track of your pain, you’re ready to set some goals to use
in your pain management plan. Select your greatest area(s) of concern and
then use the following techniques to set goals to deal with those issues.
Set realistic and achievable pain management goals. If your goals are out of
reach (such as a total cure or being pain-free), it’s almost impossible to
achieve them, so you’ll feel discouraged. Conversely, if your pain manage-
ment goals are too low (too pessimistic), then you’ll be selling yourself short.
Avoid both errors!
A surefire way to make smart goals is to use the following SMART system,
which means your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and
timely.
 Specific: You have a much greater chance of accomplishing a specific
goal than a general goal. One way to set a specific goal is to ask the 
six W questions:
222
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

• Who: Who is involved?
• What: What do I want to accomplish?
• Where: Where do I want to accomplish it?
• When: When should the goal be reached?
• Which: Which requirements and constraints must I pay 
attention to?
• Why: Why I am doing this? (List the specific reasons, purpose, or
benefits of accomplishing the goal.)
For example, a general goal is, “Feel less pain.” A specific goal is, “Join the
pool and go to aqua exercise three days a week, to increase flexibility.”
 Measurable: Choose a goal with measurable progress so that you can
actually see and feel the change occur. When you measure your progress,
you stay on track, reach your target dates, and experience the exhilara-
tion of achievement that spurs you on to continued effort required to
reach your goals.
An example is, “My goal is to walk three blocks without stopping by June
1.” When June 1 arrives and you find yourself walking down the fourth
block without stopping, you’ve surpassed your goal! Good for you!
 Attainable: Set goals that make you stretch a little, but that that you
also can realistically reach. If your goal is to lose 10 pounds in a week,
that’s unrealistic. But losing a pound a week is something you can
achieve and also feel great about.
 Realistic: Realistic means do-able. Make a plan that makes the goal real-
istic. For example, a goal of totally giving up “empty calories” is a for-
mula for failure if you love sweets and treats and eat them regularly. It
may be more realistic to set a goal of eating an apple in the afternoon in
place of your usual oatmeal cookie. You can then work toward reducing
empty calories gradually, a much more reasonable goal.
 Timely: Set a timeframe to achieve your goal, such as a week from today,
in three months, or by your daughter’s graduation. Putting a target on
your goal gives you something to work toward and to celebrate when
you achieve it. Without a time limit, you have no urgency to start taking
action now. Time should be measurable, attainable, and realistic.
Using a contract to monitor progress
Using pain records is a great way to track your progress toward your goals.
Many pain programs and counselors also recommend making a contract with
yourself to set and work toward your goals. They find that making a personal
commitment makes it more likely that you’ll follow through on your goals.
For example, your contract might look something like this:
223
Chapter 17: Tracking and Avoiding Pain Triggers

I agree for the next three months to:
 Take my medications every day.
 Walk for 20 minutes.
 Stretch for five minutes before and after walking.
 Get at least seven hours of sleep every night.
Sidestepping Pain Triggers
When you’re aware of your personal pain triggers, you can deal with them
more proactively. You may already know that chewing bubble gum gives you
headaches, jogging makes your knees swell, or eating spicy food is a no-no
for your irritable bowel syndrome.
You may also discover your triggers by tracking your pain. Keeping a diary,
using pain scales, or using a similar technique — all described earlier in 
this chapter — work because they make you pay attention to your body and
your environment. And when you pay attention to your body and the world
around you, you’ll have an easier time identifying what makes your pain
worse or better.
Make a checklist of your pain triggers and then develop your strategies for
avoiding them. For example, if you’ve identified using a backpack is a trigger
for your neck pain, make it your goal to stop using one and instead purchase
a tote bag on wheels. (A better choice: Stop carrying around so much stuff!)
Using handy gadgets
Literally hundreds of assistive products can help people adjust to chronic
pain of all types. We like to call these products handy gadgets. They’re also
known as assistive devices, assistive technology, or adaptive devices.
These gadgets help people with chronic pain accomplish the activities
they’ve always done but must now do differently. One of their biggest 
advantages is that they can help people avoid pain triggers. These handy
gadgets include the following:
 Aids for daily living: Gadgets to help with activities of daily living, 
such as bathing, carrying items, getting dressed, and managing personal
hygiene. For example, if you love to garden, consider pruning shears
especially designed for individuals with arthritis, carpal tunnel syn-
drome, or similar problems. If you have trouble moving from a seated
position, some products can help considerably, such as lift chairs 
that enable people to sit comfortably and safely and get up easily.
224
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 Computers: Gadgets, software, and accessories that enable people 
with limitations to use desktop and laptop computers and other kinds 
of information technology. For example, software and hardware that
enables sight-challenged people to read text in large fonts or that 
converts text to speech may be just what you need.
 Controls: Gadgets that enable people with limitations to start, stop, or
adjust electric or electronic devices. For example, a one-handed camera
gives you the ability to operate the zoom lens. Some products enable
people with chronic pain and limitations to drive or ride in cars, vans,
trucks, and buses.
 Housekeeping: Gadgets that assist in cooking, cleaning, and other
household activities. They include everything from adapted appliances
to smart homes, which use computers to control appliances and other
parts of the house remotely or to respond automatically to the people
living in it. Without flicking a switch, smart homes do everything from
filling bath tubs half full with water of a predetermined temperature 
to lifting cupboards up and down so that they will be at the most 
appropriate position for different people.
 Recreation: Many gadgets and products help people with chronic pain
with their leisure and athletic activities. For example, a knitting needle
holder that enables you to knit with one hand, a glove that can help you
grasp the handles of pool cues, and The HandBike, a hand-propelled
bicycle for people with problems in their lower bodies or with spinal
cord injuries, are all products that may work well for you.
You can identify many gadgets through ABLEDATA, a government program
that provides an Internet database on assistive devises and rehabilitation
equipment available from domestic and international sources. ABLEDATA
(www.abledata.com) doesn’t sell products listed on the database, but it
provides information on how to contact manufacturers or distributors of 
the products.
Maintaining the right body mechanics
When you have chronic pain, learning the right body mechanics enables 
you to move in a way that avoids further injury and triggering of more 
pain. Body mechanics are related to biomechanics, which, among other
things, is the study of how your body reacts to its own weight and the 
environment’s gravity.
Why do you need good body mechanics? People with chronic pain often sit,
stand, and walk in very awkward and even rigid positions to avoid irritating
the painful parts of the body. The result can be new pain in a new area of
the body, which is the result of awkward positioning. Learning how to keep
your body in the right position can help protect your skeleton, organs, and
soft tissues and allows you to use your body in a safe way.
225
Chapter 17: Tracking and Avoiding Pain Triggers

Different professionals, including physical and occupational therapists, can
teach you good body mechanics. (See Chapter 13 for information about 
physical and occupational therapists and the many services they provide.)
In addition, you may want to consider a practitioner in one of the following
methods. They are trained in body mechanics:
 The Feldenkrais method is a system that gives people a greater 
understanding of their bodies. The method uses movement and aware-
ness, and is thought of as a complementary and alternative technique,
but we include it here because of its value for learning good body
mechanics.
The Feldenkrais Method is used by people who want to reduce their
pain or limitations while walking and moving around. Many people 
feel that the method improves movement-related pain in their backs,
knees, hips, or shoulders. It also can lead to better recovery for 
people who have had strokes. To find out more about Feldenkrais go to
www.feldenkrais.com. To find a class near you, click Practitioners/
Classes and Events and then Find an ATM class. (ATM stands for
Awareness Through Movement.)
 The Alexander Technique is an educational system with the intention 
of teaching practitioners to recognize and overcome bad habits in their
posture and movement. As with the Feldenkrais Method, the Alexander
Technique is thought of as a type of complementary and alternative
technique. Students of the technique are taught to stand, walk, and sit 
in ways that are not stressful on the body. To find out more about the
Alexander Technique, go to www.alexandertech.com. To find

 Shunning trigger foods
 Maintaining a healthy weight
I keep trying to lose weight, but it keeps finding me!”
“I’m on a seafood diet. I see food, and I eat it.”
“Inside some of us is a thin person struggling to get out, but she can usually
be sedated with a few pieces of chocolate cake.”
P
robably more jokes are told about the struggle to lose weight than any
other topic, including blondes! That’s because losing weight is such a
universal phenomenon and so ridiculously difficult for most people that
almost everyone can relate to it. Even the string beans of the world get the
jokes because they know numerous people who’ve tried countless diets to 
no avail. Yet weight control and good nutrition are both possible. In fact,
they’re inextricably linked. In addition, weight control and good nutrition 
also directly affect your level of chronic pain. Too many pounds equal a
higher level of pain, and some foods can actually trigger pain.
Healthy nutrition is a very important topic for anyone who has chronic pain.
Because, as Carol Ann Rinzler says in Nutrition For Dummies (Wiley), “Food is
life. All living things, including you, need food and water to live. Beyond that,
you need good food, meaning food with the proper nutrients to live well.”
And when you have chronic pain, living well is a priority.
This chapter focuses on following healthy diet guidelines and keeping your
weight under control, which, in turn, can help tame the wild lion of your
chronic pain into an annoying kitty.

Paying Attention to Nourishing 
Your Body
Are you malnourished? Your answer may be, “Are you kidding? My T-shirts
are XL!” We hear you! Yet it’s very common to be both overweight and 
malnourished. Not the starving-in-a-poor country kind of malnourished, but
malnourished nonetheless.
You may be malnourished if you have any of the following food issues:
 A diet deficient in nutrients because it’s unbalanced: For example, do
you shun fruits and vegetables, thinking they’re reserved for children or
aging hippies or because you just don’t like them? Do you consume a lot
of sweets and soda? We know one 20-something-year-old who goes to
college full time and works two jobs. Her diet consists of colas (love that
sugar and caffeine!) and candy bars. If scenarios such as these apply to
you, you may be malnourished.
 A diet deficient in nutrients because you have an eating disorder:
Eating disorders are severe disturbances in the way an individual eats,
such as a woman who’s eating so little that she’s literally starving 
herself. Or conversely, binging on food (and maybe purging, too) is
another form of an eating disorder. All eating disorders can cause 
serious malnourishment and health problems.
 A diet deficient in nutrients because of a medical problem: Some med-
ical problems dramatically affect nutrition. For example, people with
kidney problems must restrict the amount of protein they eat, causing
shrinking of muscle tissue, a buildup of fluids (edema), anemia, and
other medical problems. Another example: People with a severe allergy
to gluten can develop a deficiency in vitamin B6, which is essential 
to good health. For example, vitamin B6 is needed for more than 100
enzymes involved in protein metabolism. It’s also essential for red blood
cell metabolism.
 A diet deficient in nutrients because of medications you take: Some
medicines block the absorption of nutrients. For example, if you have an
ulcer or acid reflux and have been taking acid-reducing drugs for a long
time, they can cause vitamin B12 deficiency. Your body needs vitamin
B12 to help maintain healthy nerves and red blood cells.
In addition, some drugs are known to lower vitamin C levels, such as
estrogen and also aspirin, if taken frequently.
If any of these issues apply to you, then you may be malnourished because
your body is lacking one or more key nutrients. Here are some signs of 
malnutrition:
228
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 Loss of appetite
 Weight loss or a very thin body structure
 Lack of energy
 Dull hair, skin, and eyes
 Swollen abdomen
 Water retention
If you have any of these symptoms, discuss them with your doctor who 
may draw some blood from you to test for deficiencies caused by lack of 
adequate nutrition.
Healthy Eating
The key principle of a healthy diet is to eat a well-balanced variety of 
wholesome foods so that you’ll take in all the nutrients required for good
health and disease prevention. Probably the best nutritional advice comes
from Dr. Walter Willett and his colleagues at the Harvard School of Public
Health (HSPH).
Dr. Willett’s premise is that your diet should consist mostly of health-
promoting foods and drinks, which you eat frequently. Foods that aren’t
health-promoting should be eaten far less often and in small amounts. “Duh,”
you say! “That’s pretty obvious!” Well, Dr. Willett made this simple concept
even simpler by recommending health-promoting foods that you can (and
should) eat a lot of and the foods you should limit.
Dr. Willett organizes his nutrition guidelines into levels similar to the govern-
ment’s food pyramid. For our purposes, we give you the amounts in each
level in a checklist that you can copy and use for meal planning.
Each level that Dr. Willett specifies has its own special significance:
 Level 1: Exercise daily and control your weight. (See Chapter 19 for
information on exercise.)
 Level 2: Whole-grain foods are healthy carbohydrates your body needs
for energy. Eat them at most meals. Whole grains contain the essential
parts of the grain’s seed or the equivalent. Examples of generally
accepted whole-grain foods and flours are amaranth, barley (lightly
pearled), brown and colored rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn and whole
cornmeal, millet, oatmeal and whole oats, popcorn, quinoa, whole 
rye, whole or cracked wheat, wheat berries, and wild rice.
229
Chapter 18: Nutrition and Weight Control

Stay away from anything made with “white” flour. All the good nutrition
has been refined right out of the grain!
Level 2 also includes plant oils. Because most people get one-third or
more of their calories from fats, they’re in the first level of Willet’s guide-
lines. However, the fats you eat should be health promoters. Stay away
from trans fats, animal fats, and palm, palm kernel, and coconut oils.
Replace them with olive or canola oil. Flaxseed and nut oils are also
great for your heart and for fighting inflammation. Fried foods are on the
forbidden list, along with margarines, unless they contain an ingredient
called sitostanol, a plant sterol that lowers cholesterol absorption.
Benecol, Take Control, or other margarine-like spreads include this
ingredient.
 Level 3: Produce (vegetables and fruits) make up the third level. Men
should eat nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and women
should eat seven servings. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables can help
prevent many chronic diseases. They’re also great for your digestive
system. Because they’re low in calories and high in fiber, fruits and 
vegetables are great foods for weight control, particularly if you cut back
on high-calorie foods.
Fruits and vegetables also have phytochemicals, non-nutritive chemicals
that have protective or disease preventive properties. These chemicals
have been dubbed super foods, because they’re thought to be remark-
able health boosters.
By sampling one food of every color a couple of times a day, you’re 
more likely to eat the recommended five to nine servings of vegetables
and fruits every day. For example, at lunch you could have a salad with 
1 cup of green spinach, and the following sprinkled on top: 1 tablespoon
chopped white onion, 1/2 cup of red tomatoes, 1/2 cup of yellow pineap-
ple chunks, orange slices equivalent to half an orange, and 1/2 cup of
blueberries.
 Level 4: Nuts and legumes are the fourth level. They should be enjoyed
one to three times daily. Nuts and legumes are excellent sources of 
protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
Nuts are often overlooked as the elegant source of protein that they are.
Yes, nuts are high in fat, but the fat is heart-healthy and may help lower
low-density lipoproteins. In fact, nuts are recommended as part of the
DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, a dietary plan
supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and clinically
proven to significantly reduce blood pressure. Legumes are healthy, too,
and include many vegetables, such as string beans, lentils, dried beans,
and peas. The DASH diet recommends four to five servings per week of
nuts, seeds, and legumes.
230
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 Level 5: Fish, poultry, and eggs are important sources of lean protein,
and you should eat them up to two times a day. Lean animal proteins 
are healthful proteins. The best choices are fish, shellfish, skinless lean
chicken or turkey, low-fat or fat-free dairy (such as skim milk and low-fat
cheese), egg whites (no yolks), and egg substitute.
 Level 6: You need dairy or calcium supplements one to two times a day.
Dairy products are great sources of protein but can contain a lot of satu-
rated fat. In fact, three glasses of whole milk have as much saturated fat
as 13 strips of cooked bacon! No-fat or low-fat dairy products are great.
You can also get your calcium from other sources, such as broccoli 
and soybeans.
 Level 7: Remember the old joke? If it tastes good, spit it out! Most of us
love the way fat, starch, and sweets taste. But, stay away from these
foods as much as possible. Eat them only occasionally for special treats.
Here’s why:
• Red meat, and butter: Foods in these two categories contain lots of
saturated fat, which is very bad for your cardiovascular system
and is also high in calories.
• White rice, white bread, potatoes, white pasta, soda, and sweets:
These foods are also forbidden because they are empty calories. 
In other words, they’re high in calories, but have absolutely no
nutritional value. Notice that even potatoes are restricted, so 
potatoes and butter are really no-no-nos!
231
Chapter 18: Nutrition and Weight Control
Would you like some nuts with that?
The FDA recommends eating up to 1.5 ounces of
nuts daily. Here are some tips:
 A handful of nuts equals about 1-ounce.
 On average, a 1.5-ounce serving is equiva-
lent to about 1/3 cup of nuts.
 In terms of protein 1/3 cup of nuts or 2 table-
spoons of peanut butter equals about 1
ounce of meat.
Legumes are low in fat, high in protein, and
absorb the flavor of spices and herbs. Beans and
other legumes have many nutrients important to
prevent heart disease, cancer, and obesity.
They’re also high in complex carbohydrates,
fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
When lentils are eaten with rice, they become a
complete protein, which means that they contain
all the amino acids that you need in your diet.
Many classes of dry beans are available in the
United States, including black beans, black-eyed
peas, chickpeas, cranberry, and Great Northern,
kidney, lima, navy (pea), and pinto beans.

Cutting Back on Calories 
to Avoid Obesity
Due to the lack of activity that often accompanies chronic pain, you can
easily gain weight and even become obese. Putting on unnecessary pounds
can become a serious problem even if it was never an issue in the past. In
other words, even if you were a Skinny Minnie or a Slim Jim before chronic
pain struck, you’re not immune to becoming super-sized when you have
chronic pain.
Being super-sized is a big health risk. Obesity can cause early death, strokes,
diabetes, heart disease, and blood clots that can break off and travel to 
the lungs, in addition to causing a large number of other life-threatening 
conditions.
If you have chronic pain and are inactive, you should not keep eating the
same amount of calories as you did before pain became a permanent intruder
in your life.
And here’s more bad news: Weight gain can happen sooner than you may
think. Therefore, cut down on overall calories and adjust your eating habits
whenever you reduce your activity level.
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
To live as well as possible with chronic pain, your weight should be under
control. That means you’re not too fat or too thin.
The formula for weight control is calories in = calories out. If the amount of
calories you take in equals the amount that you spend through daily activity
and exercise, your weight will remain the same. If the amount of calories is
more than your activity and exercise expenditure, you’ll put on weight. If the
amount of calories is less than you spend, then you’ll lose weight.
232
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 
Getting the truth about nutrition
A lot of confusing information about nutrition
appears on the Web, in the media, and in book-
stores. The Nutrition Source cuts through all that,
providing clear tips for healthy eating and 
dispelling nutrition myths along the way. Go to its
Web site at www.hsph.harvard.edu/
nutritionsource/index.html to find
out what you should eat and why.

So, weight loss is basically a process of eating less and exercising more. 
A pound of body weight is equal to 3,500 calories. If you eat 500 fewer calo-
ries less per day than the amount you need, you’ll lose 1 pound per week.
The same rule applies to exercise. If you exercise the equivalent of another
500 calories per day — such as exercising on an elliptical machine for 
30 minutes — and also eat 500 fewer calories a day, you’ll lose two pounds.
(Exercising can also be great for chronic pain!)
One way to judge whether you’re overweight, underweight, or in a normal
range is by using a number calculated from a person’s weight and height
called the Body Mass Index (BMI). To determine your own BMI, check out the
table at the Centers for Disease Control at www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/
bmi/index.htm.
Avoiding Trigger Foods
If you have food allergies or intolerances that trigger your chronic pain,
taking those foods out of your diet can bring relief. If you’re allergic or intol-
erant to a food (and maybe you don’t know it because you’ve had a reaction
that wasn’t severe), eating this food can increase your chronic pain level.
If you have a food allergy, your immune system reacts to a protein that it
thinks is poison. In the most extreme cases, your body reacts with swelling,
hives, asthma, or other symptoms of an allergy.
Ninety percent of all food-allergic reactions are caused by one of eight foods:
 Lactose in milk
 Eggs
 Peanuts
 Tree nuts, such as walnuts and cashews
 Fish
 Crustacean shellfish
 Soybeans
 Gluten (found in wheat and some other grains)
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now requires food labels to clearly
state if products contain any proteins from these foods.
A food intolerance is a problem with the body’s metabolizing certain foods.
Milk lactose and wheat gluten are common triggers. If you’re sensitive to
these foods, your symptoms can include gas, bloating, abdominal pain, and
headaches.
233
Chapter 18: Nutrition and Weight Control

Some people don’t realize that they have a food intolerance. Try eliminating
milk or wheat from your diet for at least one week and see whether you feel
better. If you do, you may have a food intolerance.
Nodding Yes to Nibbling
Now is your chance to eat all day long! Nibbling throughout the day has many
health benefits, such as reducing the symptoms of diabetes, lowering choles-
terol, and reducing the chance of heart disease. Nibbling can also help you
control your weight as long as you keep the portions under control.
Here’s the catch. You have to give up those large three square meals a day.
Here’s why: In 1989, researchers led by Dr. David J. A. Jenkins, a professor at
the University of Toronto, conducted a study in nibbling. In the study, seven
men ate food equaling 2,500 calories a day. For two weeks, they ate the way
most Americans do — three meals a day. Then for another two weeks, they
ate the same amount of calories in 17 snacks throughout the day.
The results were reported in The New England Journal of Medicine. The nib-
blers’ diet had the benefit of reducing cholesterol levels and low-density
lipoprotein (the bad one). Nibbling also caused the release of smaller
amounts of insulin and evened out its secretion, preventing the yo-yo effects
of surges of insulin after large meals.
Try to eat many small meals throughout the day rather than three large ones.
Just remember, though, that when you nibble, you need to stay away from
those saturated fats and empty calories. Focus on grains, fruits and veggies,
and lean protein.

s this scenario familiar to you? So many areas of your body are sore that
you find yourself trying to protect the painful parts and avoid moving in
ways that make you hurt more. You’re moving like a stick person, and you’re
limping to lessen the pain. Also, when you’re sitting down, you slouch over to

chronic pain (which may be caused by any condition included in this book).
And your fatigue is accompanied by the blahs. In other words, you’re totally
worn out and a little depressed. “I can barely move,” you say. “How could I
possibly go to the health club?” (Or go for a walk, or do the exercises that the
physical therapist gave you.)
Situations like these cause a cascade effect throughout your body that results
in a physical state known as deconditioning. For example, if you limp on your
left leg, it throws off your right leg, which is now carrying most of the
burden). And, if you’re overweight, the excess pounds intensify the stress on
the other leg. Or, if you’re a couch potato and avoid all types of exercise, you
quickly get out of shape, which makes your chronic pain worse and exacer-
bates the fatigue and depression.
This chapter covers how to prevent deconditioning through exercising and
also offers you the best exercises for people with chronic pain.

Turning Around Deconditioning 
through Physical Therapy
When your movement is very limited for an extended period (weeks, months,
or longer!), you develop a physical state that the health community calls
deconditioning. The way you move, the way you protect the sore parts of
your body, the way you hold your body, and the amount of exercise you get
all affect the overall condition of your body.
If you’re deconditioned, it’s important to work on reversing this state.
Deconditioning makes it much more likely that you’ll have health problems,
such as coronary artery disease and some types of cancer. In fact, research
has shown that physical inactivity doubles the chance of getting coronary
artery disease. Conversely, regular exercise helps protect you from colon and
some cancers of the breast, endometrium, and ovaries.
One of the best things you can do when you have chronic pain and you’re
starting an exercise program is to work with a qualified physical therapist.
(For a description of what physical therapists do and how to find a qualified
professional, see Chapter 13.) The goals of physical therapy (PT) are to get
your body functioning again, relieve your pain, and teach you how to keep up
the recovery on your own.
A physical therapist can help you turn around your deconditioning and make
you stronger and more flexible than ever. You’ll also have more endurance. In

Why exercise?
Research has shown that exercise achieves the
following good outcomes. Exercise
 Reduces many types of pain
 Promotes a healthy weight
 Strengthens muscles and bones
 Lubricates joints
 Increases endurance
 Helps insomnia
 Prevents hypertension
 Prevents heart disease
 Reduces the risk of diabetes
 Raises good cholesterol and lowers bad
cholesterol
 Boosts the immune system
 Improves overall health
 Relieves symptoms of depression
 Promotes self-confidence
 Reduces the risk of injury by improving flex-
ibility and bone mass

addition, PT can also boost your self-confidence. Having more strength, flexi-
bility, endurance, and better balance will make you proud of your abilities.
You’ve done yourself a very big favor and accomplished something really major.
When you start working with a physical therapist, he’ll also play an impor-
tant role in helping you set your exercise goals. He’ll evaluate your condition
and design an exercise program appropriate for your pain level, abilities, and
condition.
Exercising Right for Your Pain Condition
Many people despise exercise of all types and find every excuse not to do it.
Describing working out in her magazine, O, Oprah Winfrey, purportedly the
richest woman in the world, said: “There’s no easy way out. If there were, I
would have bought it. And believe me, it would be one of my favorite things!”
So, you may be rich or poor, a star or an average Joe or Jane, but you still have
to get moving or live with the unhappy consequences of a deconditioned body.
The No. 1 rule for exercise and chronic pain is to do as much as you can as
often as you can. As you probably know all too well, exercise can cause a little
pain, particularly when you’re first starting out after a long period of inactivity.
The reason why you sometimes feel pain when you start exercising is that it
causes small injuries to the soft tissues of your body. As the injuries heal,
your tissues get stronger, helping you become conditioned! So, if you feel a
little pain during or after exercise, don’t let it stop you. Keep going. In general,
more exercise means less pain unless you’ve overdone it, which is another
matter. Be sure to build up your exercise program gradually to prevent doing
too much and too soon.
An important rule concerning chronic pain and exercise is to try to experi-
ence all four of the major types of exercise on a regular basis:
 Endurance
 Strength
 Flexibility
 Balance
Performing all four types helps you rebuild your body and become fully con-
ditioned. Sure, it’s okay to do just a little bit in each of the four types when
you’re first getting started, but do be sure you cover all four categories.
The following sections offer key details about the four important categories
of exercise.
237
Chapter 19: Getting Physical: Flexibility, Strength, Endurance, and Balance

Exercising for endurance
If you have trouble climbing stairs or walking more than a few blocks, your
body probably needs to build up endurance. Endurance exercise, which is
another name for aerobic exercise, builds stamina. Endurance exercise
increases your heart rate and breathing. It’s also great for your cardiovascu-
lar system and lungs. Endurance exercise is the key to becoming conditioned.
When beginning endurance exercise, start slowly and build up gradually. 
A good rule is to work up gradually to 30 minutes of endurance exercise a 
minimum of four times a week.
Endurance exercise includes such activities as bicycling, walking, running,
swimming, rowing, skating, and working out on equipment, such as elliptical
trainers or stair-step machines.
Building up strength
Strength exercises accomplish what they claim in their name: They make you
stronger. This type of exercise also helps you control your weight because,
happily, it speeds up your metabolism. Strength exercises also give you the
vigor for a more active life, and they help you complete tasks such as carry-
ing groceries or performing your endurance exercises more easily!
To get the benefits of strength training, exercise all your major muscle groups
at least twice a week. But — and this is very important! — don’t exercise the
same muscle group two days in a row. Doing strength exercises too often can
end up harming rather than helping you.
Here are a few strength-training exercises to consider:
 Weights: Perhaps the most well-known method of strength training is
using weights, which are sold in most sports and department stores and
are available in health clubs. You can also use soup cans or water bot-
tles filled with equal amounts of fluid. It’s important to get instruction
from your physical therapist or a qualified trainer on the proper way to
lift weights.
 Resistance bands: Resistance bands are giant rubber bands that you pull
against (resist) to strengthen certain muscle groups. Resistance bands
are more convenient than most weight-lifting gear, and they’re also inex-
pensive and easily carried in a purse, pocket, or small bag. Resistance
238
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

bands come in different levels, from easy-to-stretch to progressively
more difficult. Ask your physical therapist or a qualified trainer how to
use resistance bands.
 Pilates: The goal of the Pilates program is to build strength in the core of
your body. Pilates teaches body awareness, good posture, and easy,
graceful movement. The program emphasizes proper breathing, correct
spinal and pelvic alignment, and complete concentration on smooth,
flowing movement. Pilates classes use machines called reformers or floor
mats. Many instructional video programs are available, but if you’re a
beginner at Pilates, it’s important to start by getting instruction from a
well-trained professional. A great resource is Pilates For Dummies
(Wiley) by Michelle Dozois.
Gaining flexibility
A program of stretching can do wonders to reverse stiffness and soreness.
Stretching and moving your joints and supporting tissues through their full
range of motion promote flexibility, which, in turn, helps to hold back decon-
ditioning and its result: increased pain.
You need to stretch properly, so be sure to get your instruction from a well-
trained professional. The techniques in the “Exercises for Conditioning” sec-
tion, later in this chapter, include some important movements that you can
do at home.
If you do these exercises regularly, you can prevent overly tight muscles. Do
your stretching exercises after performing your endurance and strength
training, and when your muscles are warm.
Getting balanced
Loss of balance is common for people with chronic pain conditions, leading
to falls and difficulty walking. Here’s the good news: Strength and balance
exercises overlap, so one exercise can work for both problems. (For more on
strength exercises, see the section “Building up strength,” earlier in this
chapter.) Balance exercises build up your leg muscles. Any of the lower-body
exercises for strength in the next section are good for balance.
239
Chapter 19: Getting Physical: Flexibility, Strength, Endurance, and Balance

Exercises for Conditioning
The following exercises can help you prevent deconditioning. If you’re a
beginner or you haven’t exercised for awhile, you can expect to have sore
muscles for the first week or two of your exercise program.
If the soreness doesn’t go away or you’re hurting so much that you’re not
exercising, be sure to talk this issue over with your physical therapist and/or
doctor. Most importantly, if any of these exercises cause moderate to severe
pain, then stop right away and wait to do the exercise again only after you
talk to your physical therapist or doctor.
Keep in mind that breathing correctly is important during all exercise. Exhale
during the initial movement and inhale slowly when returning to the original
position. Never hold your breath during any exercise. Be smooth and deliber-
ate in all your movements. Don’t bounce while stretching or performing any
exercise.
Biceps curl
The biceps curl, shown in Figure 19-1, strengthens your upper-arm muscles.
Here’s how you do a biceps curl:
1. Sit in an armless chair or on a bench with your feet flat on the floor,
spaced apart so that they are even with your shoulders.
2. Hold hand weights, soup cans of equal weight, or a resistance band in
each hand with your palms facing your hips.
Your arms should be straight down at your side.
3. Take 3 seconds to lift your left hand weight toward your shoulder by
bending your elbow; as you lift, turn your left hand so that your palm
is facing your shoulder, holding the position for 1 second.
Do not use your upper arm!
4. Take 3 seconds to lower your hand to the starting position.
5. Pause and then repeat Steps 3 and 4 with your right arm.
6. Alternate until you have repeated the exercise 8 to 15 times on each
side.
7. Rest and then do another set of 8 to 15 alternating repetitions.
240
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

Here are some tips to follow when doing a biceps curls:
 You can do this exercise while standing.
 Keep your elbows glued to your sides all the way through the exercise.
 Avoid rocking back and forth.
 Don’t bend your wrist. Keep it straight with your forearm.
 Don’t let the weight pull your arm down when lowering it. Let it down
slowly resisting its weight.
 Do not lift the weights higher than your neck.
Chair stands
The chair stand exercise, shown in Figure 19-2, strengthens the muscles in
your stomach and thighs. Here’s how it works:
1. Sit toward the middle or front of a chair and lean back so that you’re
in a half-reclining position, with your back and shoulders straight,
knees bent, and feet flat on the floor.
Figure 19-1:
The biceps
curl.
241
Chapter 19: Getting Physical: Flexibility, Strength, Endurance, and Balance

2. Cross your arms and put your hands on your shoulders.
3. Keeping your head, neck, and back straight, bring your upper body
forward and then stand up slowly.
4. Sit back down slowly and return to your original position.
5. Repeat four to six times; build up gradually to 8 to 12 repetitions.
Your goal is to do this exercise without using your hands as you become
stronger.
6. Repeat 8 to 15 times.
7. Rest; then repeat 8 to 15 times more.
You should feel your abdominal muscles working as you do this exercise.

Here are some tips to follow when doing chair stands.
 Be sure not to lean forward with your shoulders as you rise.
 Don’t sit down too quickly.
 Don’t lean your weight too far forward or onto your toes when 
standing up.
Arm raise
Arm raises, shown in Figure 19-3, strengthen your shoulder muscles. Here’s
how you do the arm raise exercise:
1. Sit on a chair and place your feet flat on the floor, spaced apart so that
they’re even with your shoulders.
2. Hold a 1- to 2-pound weight or a soup can with one hand and raise
your right arm until the elbow is straightened; hold for 5 seconds.
Figure 19-3:
Arm raise
243
Chapter 19: Getting Physical: Flexibility, Strength, Endurance, and Balance

3. Lower your arm slowly.
4. Repeat ten times with each arm.
Two other important arm exercises are similar to this one, but you move
your arms in front of you or to the side.
 Arms in front: Sit in a chair. Hold the weights straight down at your
sides, with your palms facing inward. Take 3 seconds to lift your arms in
front of you, keeping them straight and rotating them so that your palms
are facing upward. Stop when your arms are parallel to the ground. Hold
the position for 1 second. Take 3 seconds to lower your arms so that
they’re straight down by your sides again. Pause. Repeat 8 to 15 times.
Rest; do another set of 8 to 15 repetitions.
 Arms to the side: Sit in a chair. Hold the weights straight down at your
sides, with your palms facing inward. Take 3 seconds to lift your arms
straight out, sideways, until they’re parallel to the ground. Hold the posi-
tion for 1 second. Take 3 seconds to lower your arms so that they’re
straight down by your sides again. Pause. Repeat 8 to 15 times. Rest; do
another set of 8 to 15 repetitions.
Plantar flexion
The plantar flexion exercise, shown in Figure 19-4, strengthens the ankle and
calf muscles. You can use this exercise for developing balance following the
instructions in the “Getting balanced” section, earlier in this chapter.
Here’s an example of how to do it:
1. Stand straight, feet flat on the floor, holding on to the edge of a table
or chair for balance; take 3 seconds to stand as high up on tiptoe as
you can; hold for 1 second, and then take 3 seconds to slowly lower
yourself back down.
As you become stronger, do this exercise first on your right leg only,
then on your left leg only, for a total of 8 to 15 times on each leg.
2 Repeat this exercise 8 to 15 times; rest a minute and then do another
set of 8 to 15 repetitions.
3. Rest a minute and then do another set of 8 to 15 alternating 
repetitions.
You can also use ankle weights if you feel strong enough.
244
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

Knee flexion
The knee flexion exercise, shown in Figure 19-5, strengthens muscles in the
back of your thigh. You can use this exercise for developing balance following
the instructions in the “Getting balanced” section, earlier in this chapter.
Here’s how it works:
1. Stand straight.
If you need to, you can hold on to a sturdy table or chair for balance.
2. Slowly bend one knee as far as possible so that your foot lifts up
behind you; hold position for 1 second.
3. Slowly lower your foot all the way back down to the floor.
4. Repeat with your other leg for a total of 8 to 15 times on each leg.
5. Rest a minute and then do another set of 8 to 15 alternating 
repetitions.

You can also use ankle weights for this exercise.
Hip flexion
The hip flexion, shown in Figure 19-6, strengthens your hip and thigh mus-
cles. Here’s how it works:
1. Stand straight.
If you need to, you can hold on to a sturdy table or chair for balance.
2. Slowly bend one knee toward chest, without bending waist or hips,
and hold this position for 1 second.
3. Slowly lower your leg all the way to the floor.
4. Repeat with your other leg for a total of 8 to 15 times on each leg.
5. Rest a minute and then do another set of 8 to 15 alternating 
repetitions.
You can use this exercise for developing balance following the instructions in
the “Getting balanced” section, earlier in this chapter. You can also use ankle
weights for this exercise.

The hip extension, shown in Figure 19-7, strengthens the buttock and lower-
back muscles. Here’s how to do it:
1. Hold on to a table that’s 12 to 18 inches away from you.
2. Slowly lift one leg straight backward and hold for 1 second.
3. Slowly lower your leg.
4. Repeat with the other leg for a total of 8 to 15 times on each leg.
5. Rest a minute and then do another set of 8 to 15 alternating 
repetitions.
You can use this exercise for developing balance following the instructions in

Hamstring stretch
This exercise, shown in Figure 19-8, stretches your hamstrings, which are the
mid-rear thigh muscles.
You can do this exercise many different ways. Here’s one way!
1. Lie with your back and head flat against the floor.
2. Bend your knees and place both feet on the floor.
3. Straighten your right leg and point your toes.
Your left knee should be on the floor, slightly flexed.
4. Slowly raise your right leg toward the ceiling, keeping your leg
straight. Extend your leg until you feel a stretch in your right 
hamstring; hold stretch for a count of 8.
Figure 19-7:
Hip

248
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

5. Repeat on your left leg.
6. Repeat three times on each side.
Here are some tips to follow when doing the hamstring stretch exercise.
 Do not do this exercise if you have pain radiating down your leg, or you
have a bulging disc or herniated disc.
 Keep your head and back against the floor.
 Don’t lift your leg too quickly when preparing to stretch your hamstring.
Thigh and calf stretch
The thigh and calf stretches, shown in Figure 19-9, stretch your thigh and calf
muscles. Here’s how to do them:
The thigh stretch:
1. Hold on to something for balance; standing on one leg, grasp the foot
of the other leg.
Keep your knee pointing down.
2. Pull up your leg with light pressure; hold your foot in this position,
behind you for 30 seconds and then relax.
You should feel the stretch in the front of your thigh.
3. Repeat this stretch three times for each side.
Figure 19-8:
Hamstring

249
Chapter 19: Getting Physical: Flexibility, Strength, Endurance, and Balance

Here are some tips to follow when doing the thigh stretch:
 Be careful not to arch your back.
 You do not need to pull your leg up all the way to your buttocks.
The calf stretch:
1. Rest your hands on a wall at about shoulder height and place one foot
forward in a lunging position.
2. Stand upright, making sure that both toes are facing forward and your
heel is on the ground.
3. While keeping your back leg straight, lean toward the wall.
You should feel the stretch in the calf of your back leg.
Here are a couple of tips to follow when doing the calf stretch:
 Don’t stick your bottom out.
 For a deeper stretch, try bending your back knee so that you’re sitting
down with your weight over the back leg.

Neck exercises
Neck exercises can help relieve pain and stiffness in your neck. They
strengthen your neck muscles and keep them flexible. They can also help
reduce the frequency and severity of your headaches. You can do these exer-
cises every half hour throughout the day to prevent neck strain.
To do neck exercises, gently tense your neck muscles for a few seconds in
each position. If you do them every day, the neck movements will increase
your muscle strength.
Here’s what you do:
 Tilt from front to back: Tilt your head slowly back, far enough so you
can look up, and hold for 5 seconds. Return slowly to front position.
Repeat five to ten times.
 Rotate head from side to side: Slowly turn your head as far as you can
and hold for 5 seconds . Return your head to the center. Move your head
in the opposite direction. Repeat five to ten times.
 Tilt from side to side: Keep your head straight as you slowly tilt it over
to the side and hold for 5 seconds, as shown in Figure 19-10. (Don’t go so
far that you touch your ear with your shoulder.) Return your head to
center position. Move your head to your opposite shoulder and repeat
five to ten times.

Achieving balance!
Would you like to ace the balance class? You
should have someone stand next to you when
you do this! Do your strength exercises for the
lower body and hold on to your support with
only one hand. Eventually hold on with only four
fingertips, then three, and so on. Then try not
holding on at all. Finally, when you’re ready,
don’t hold on at all, and also keep your eyes
closed.
Other ways to build up your balance are to
stand on one leg or use a wobble board. Of
course, do not try these exercises without the
guidance of a physical therapist or other exer-
cise professional. (As well as gaining the
approval of your medical doctor.)
Another great way to develop balance is to try
Tai Chi, which is a martial art in China and a pop-
ular movement in the West. Classes in Tai Chi
are widely available in the United States and
offer increased balance and flexibility when
aerobic exercise isn’t possible or desirable.

I
f you have chronic pain (and maybe chronic stress as well), getting
enough sleep may be a major challenge for you. You may toss and turn
while trying to get to sleep, and then once you’re “there,” sudden jabs of pain
jolt you awake. Or you may have other sleep problems, such as sleep apnea
or restless legs syndrome. Whatever the causes, a sleep deficit can impair
your thinking and memory and make you groggy, affecting your alertness,
causing your energy levels to plummet, and also making you downright
grumpy. In addition, loss of sleep and the weariness it causes can even make
you accident-prone, resulting in injuries, accidents, and crashes.
Finally, sleep loss can make you more sensitive to pain, according to the
National Sleep Foundation. One study found that sleep deprivation caused by
continuous sleep disturbances throughout the night increased spontaneous
pain and impaired the body’s ability to cope with painful stimuli.
This chapter discusses major sleep problems that can cause or aggravate
pain and what you can do about them.
Losing Sleep Is a Bad Thing
Sleep is a daily period of rest, during which you’re inactive and experience
different levels of consciousness. If you’re getting adequate sleep, you spend
about one-third of each 24-hour day (give or take an hour) in this rest state.

The science of sleep is still in its infancy, and researchers have a limited
understanding of the biological function of sleep. However, it is known that a
lot goes on inside your body while you sleep. For example, during different
stages of sleep, the body temperature changes, breathing and heart rhythm
slow and then return to normal, and blood flow to the brain increases. In
addition, hormone levels change. In addition, growth hormone increases
during the first two hours of sleep. (So, when you were a kid and your mother
told you that you had to go to sleep so you’d grow, she wasn’t kidding!)
Sleep happens in stages: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and nonrapid REM
(NREM) sleep. Adults spend about 20 percent of their sleep time in REM and
80 percent in NREM sleep. Elderly people spend less than 15 percent of their
sleep time in REM sleep.
Most dreams occur during REM sleep. During REM sleep, your eyes move
back and forth rapidly. However, your muscle activity is very quiet during
this sleep stage.
Microsleeps are quick, involuntary episodes of sleep when you’re otherwise
awake, and they can be another sign of sleep deprivation. They last from 2
seconds to 2 minutes, and you may not even be aware that you’re having
them. Symptoms include blank stares, nodding your head, and closing your
eyes for much longer than it takes for a normal blink. Microsleeps are danger-
ous. While experiencing them, you can’t take in what is going on around you,
such as Stop signs when you’re driving.
254
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 
How much sleep is enough?
How much sleep you need depends on your
individual physical needs, and no magic number
applies to all people. However, most adults need
7 to 8 hours of sleep each night, according to
the National Sleep Foundation. Children need
more sleep than adults; for example, babies
need 16 to 18 hours a day of sleep, and
preschool children sleep 10 to12 hours a day.
School-aged children and teens need at least 9
hours of sleep a night. (They’re still growing,
after all.)
The elderly need about the same amount of
sleep as younger adults — between 7 and 8
hours each night. As people age, they tend to go
to sleep earlier and get up earlier than in previ-
ous decades, and they may nap more during 
the day.
If you feel drowsy during the day, even during
boring activities, you haven’t had enough sleep,
according to the National Sleep Foundation. 
In addition, if you normally fall asleep within 
5 minutes of lying down, you’re probably sleep-
deprived.

A lack of sleep is bad for your health because you may lose important time in
one of the two major stages of sleep. In addition, one of sleep’s major func-
tions is to aid mental functioning. (The parts of the brain that control learn-
ing and memory are still active during sleep.) Studies show that people who
are taught mentally challenging tasks perform significantly better after a
good night’s sleep.
Lack of adequate sleep can also:
 Make it tough to mentally focus
 Slow your reaction time
 Make you irritable
 Increase the chances that you’ll be overweight or obese (Yes! Not sleep-
ing enough can make you fat!)
 Put you at risk for depression and diabetes
 Increase your risk for high blood pressure and heart disease
 Magnify alcohol’s effects on your body
Chronic Pain and Sleep Problems
Chronic pain and the sleep problems it causes can make you hurt even more.
For example, if you’re exhausted from coping with your migraines, and on top
of that you toss and turn all night, the result can be even worse migraines.
(And you thought they couldn’t get any worse! Wrong!)
The major forms of sleep problems, described in the following sections, are
sleep apnea, insomnia, sleepwalking, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy,
snoring, teeth grinding, and hypersomnia (sleeping too much).
255
Chapter 20: Tackling Fatigue
Fatigue and chronic pain
Fatigue, a common problem for people with
chronic pain, is dangerous when combined with
driving. Falling asleep at the wheel causes at
least 100,000 crashes and 1,500 deaths each
year, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. Close to half of American
adult drivers drive while drowsy, and nearly two
out of ten admit to falling asleep at the wheel,
according to a 2002 poll conducted by the
National Sleep Foundation. If you have trouble
keeping your eyes focused, if you can’t stop
yawning, or if you can’t remember driving the
last few miles, you’re probably too drowsy to
drive safely.

Sleep apnea
Apnea is Greek for “without breath.” People with sleep apnea snore loudly,
and they actually stop breathing for brief periods during sleep. Breathless
episodes can last for a minute or longer and can occur hundreds of times
during sleep. During apnea spells, your brain wakes you up so that you’ll
restart breathing. It’s sort of like jump-starting your brain, but the result is
nonrestful sleep. Sleep apnea causes fatigue and drowsiness during waking
hours and can cause chronic morning headaches, as well as cluster, tension,
and migraine headaches.
Sleep apnea affects more than 12 million Americans, according to the
National Institutes of Health. The condition is more common in men, men and
women who are overweight, and those age 40 or older.

The standard treatment for sleep apnea is use of a continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) machine. A CPAP machine is about the size of a shoebox. 
A flexible tube connects the machine to a mask or other device you wear
during sleep. CPAP machines work by pushing air through your airway 
passage at a pressure that doesn’t cause snoring.
If you have sleep apnea, or think you may have it, add an ear, nose, and
throat doctor (otolaryngologist) to your health-care team. She can also help
you choose the right CPAP machine for you.
Insomnia
Insomnia is a lack of sleep or fitfull sleep when the chance for restful sleep is
present — such as when you’re wide awake at 2 a.m. watching the shopping
channel on TV or reading historical novels because you just can’t get to
sleep.
Insomnia can be temporary or chronic. Most people have had insomnia at
least several times in their lives, usually during stressful periods. Symptoms
include difficulty falling asleep or waking up during the night and not being
able to go back to sleep. As with sleep apnea, insomnia can cause chronic
morning headaches, as well as cluster, tension, and migraine headaches. For
treatment of insomnia, see the “Getting Some Shuteye the Natural Way” and
“Knocking Yourself Out with Medications” sections, later in this chapter.
Sleepwalking
During sleepwalking (somnambulism), people perform actions as if awake,
but they’re actually asleep. Sleepwalking usually occurs during deep non-
REM sleep. About 1 in 6 people sleepwalk, and the condition is more common
in children and teenagers than adults. Some medications, such as Ambien
(used to treat sleep disturbances), are associated with sleepwalking.
Sleepwalkers don’t remember their actions. So, if you’re a sleepwalker, you
may wander around your neighborhood or clean out your basement while
asleep, and you’d never know it unless someone woke you up during your
sojourn. Sleepwalking most often afflicts stressed or anxious people and
those with a family history of the condition.
If there’s a possibility of injuring yourself during sleepwalking, taking antide-
pressants, such as trazodone (Desyrel), or an anti-anxiety drug, like clon-
azepam (Klonopin), which is sometimes used to treat seizures, may be a
necessity.

Chapter 20: Tackling Fatigue

Snoring and snoring partners
Snoring is noisy breathing during sleep. It’s the result of a blockage to the free
flow of air during breathing, which causes structures at the back of your
mouth to strike each other and vibrate. Forty-five percent of adults snore at
least occasionally, and 25 percent are habitual snorers, according to the
American Academy of Otolaryngology. Men are most at risk for snoring. Being
overweight or obese is another major snoring risk factor.
You and/or your sleep partner may snore away every night or occasionally.
Snoring often causes disturbed and restless sleep, resulting in fatigue the
next day.
Snoring has many possible causes, including the following:
 Relaxation of throat muscles, due to aging
 Inflammation of the nose and/or throat due to colds, allergies, and
related problems
 Alcohol or medications that loosen the muscles of the throat
 Anatomical problems, such as nasal polyps or a deviated septum in the
nose
 Blockage by cysts, tumors, or excess fatty tissue in the throat (the latter
is due to being overweight)
Don’t sleep on your back, which causes the soft tissues in the back of your
throat to block your airway. Many people are successful with the “tennis ball
technique” in which you attach a tennis ball to the back of your night clothes.
You won’t be able to lie on your back, forcing you to turn on your side.
Eventually, you’ll naturally sleep on your side, and you can dump the ball.
Don’t underestimate the negative impact of snoring on a relationship. A snor-
ing partner can wake you up often or keep you from getting any sleep. The
result is drowsiness and irritation — and sometimes, it’s separate bedrooms
or even a separating couple.
Fortunately, you’re not doomed to lifelong snoring. Instead, consider the fol-
lowing suggestions to reduce your risk for snoring.
 Lose weight if you’re overweight, which will reduce fatty tissue in your
airway.
 Consider a specially designed pillow for snorers, available in retail 
or online stores. One option is the Sona Pillow available at www.
sonapillow.com and some retail stores.
258
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 Elevate the head of your bed four inches, which causes your tongue and
jaw to move forward and out of snoring position. Try placing rolled up
towels under the head of the mattress to raise it.
 Avoid alcohol at night. Alcohol worsens snoring.
 Avoid sedatives before bed. Sedatives relax throat muscles.
 Avoid high-fat dairy products or soy milk before sleeping. They can
cause mucus buildup in your throat, blocking air passages and causing
snoring.
 Try nasal decongestants, but stay away from antihistamines.
Decongestants, which increase mucus flow, can help clear your air pas-
sages. However, antihistamines, which dry up the mucus, relax the throat
muscles, leading to snoring. (Some people take Benadryl or Tylenol PM,
which contain antihistamines. These drugs help you fall asleep, but
increase your risk for snoring!)
 A number of devices can help keep your airway open. Ask your dentist
or otolaryngologist about them.
Surgery can open blocked airways by removing structures such as tonsils or
fatty tissue blocking them. A new outpatient surgery called palatal implanta-
tion involves putting small plastic implants into the soft palate. Scar tissue
forms around the implants, hardening the soft palate in the back of the throat
so that it does not vibrate.
Restless Legs Syndrome
If you have Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), you have an uncontrollable desire
to move your legs constantly. You may also have strange feelings in your legs
such as a creeping or crawling, cramping, burning, tingling, soreness, or pain.
RLS is particularly uncomfortable when you’re trying to fall asleep. It can
cause sleeplessness and daytime fatigue. RLS affects about 10 percent of
adults.
If your legs twitch and jerk spasmodically, you may have a sleep condition
called periodic limb movements (PLMS). If you have this problem, your leg
movements may be severe enough to awaken you.
According to the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research, Restless 
Legs Syndrome is underdiagnosed yet treatable. The key treatment for RLS is
taking a dopaminergic drug, such as L-Dopa, which increases the levels of a
neurotransmitter called dopamine in the central nervous system. Other 
treatments include opioids, mild tranquilizers, anticonvulsants, and iron 
supplements.

Chapter 20: Tackling Fatigue

Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is extreme daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of REM sleep
while still awake. Insomnia, dreaming while awake, and a condition called
sleep paralysis (the inability to perform voluntary movements either while
falling asleep or when waking up) are also symptoms.
Narcolepsy affects both sexes equally and develops with increasing age. The
condition may be caused by a deficiency in hypocretin, a substance that helps
to regulate sleep cycles.
Some medications improve the constant lapsing into sleep that people 
with narcolepsy suffer from. Some examples of meds that may help this 
condition are
 Stimulants, such as Methylphenidate (Ritalin), and amphetamines, such
as Adderall, the main drugs prescribed for narcolepsy. They act on the
central nervous system to help people stay alert and awake during the
day. Stimulants are effective, but may have strong side effects, such as
nervousness and heart palpitations.
 Antidepressants, such as protriptyline (Vivactil) and fluoxetine (Prozac)
help narcolepsy by suppressing REM sleep.
 Sodium oxybate (Xyrem), a central nervous system depressant, can 
control symptoms that some people with narcolepsy have, such as
episodes of cataplexy, a condition characterized by weak or paralyzed
muscles. But sodium oxybate has unpleasant side effects, such as
nausea and urinary incontinence.
If you have narcolepsy, don’t drive, skydive, or take any other actions that
may be dangerous if you suddenly fell asleep. You may want to wear a med-
ical alert charm to notify others if you have a narcolepsy spell. (MedicAlert
charms are available through www.medicalert.org.)
Teeth grinding
Some people unknowingly grind their teeth at night, a habit known as brux-
ism. This relatively common condition is like the nervous habit of tapping
your foot or twisting a lock of hair, but you’re asleep while you’re doing it.
Eight percent of adults grind their teeth at night, and more than a third of
parents report symptoms of bruxism in their children.
260
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

Among other things, bruxism can cause chronic facial, mouth, and/or jaw
pain and damage to the teeth and gums. It can greatly reduce the quality of
your sleep and also cause headaches. Sleep apnea and bruxism often go hand
and hand, and in those cases, treating your sleep apnea can reduce episodes
of bruxism. Whether or not you have sleep apnea, the standard treatment for
bruxism is an oral device designed by a dentist to protect your teeth.
Hypersomnia
Do you feel compelled to nap a lot during the day? In fact, do you sometimes
feel so compelled to nap that you have to leave important activities, such as
work or a conversation with your best friend, to take a nap? You may have
hypersomnia, which are recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness
or oversleeping at night that don’t result in feeling rested.
According to the National Sleep Foundation, up to 40 percent of people have
some symptoms of hypersomnia from time to time.
Why are you getting too much shuteye? The cause may be one or more of the
following:
 Sleep deprivation
 Excessive use of tranquilizers
 Being overweight
 Drug or alcohol abuse
 A head injury, tumor, or neurological disease, such as multiple sclerosis
 A genetic predisposition to hypersomnia
 Prescription medications, including opioid narcotics, sedatives, antide-
pressants, muscle relaxants especially Soma, and anticonvulsants
The medical treatment of hypersomnia includes prescribed stimulants, anti-
depressants, or two newer medications: Provigil, a drug that keeps you
awake (used for performance enhancement by military pilots and soldiers),
and Xyrem, used for treating people with narcolepsy who have episodes of
cataplexy, a condition characterized by weak or paralyzed muscles. CPAP
machines can also be helpful. (See the earlier section on sleep apnea for
more on these devices.)
261
Chapter 20: Tackling Fatigue

Charting Your Sleep Patterns
In order to detect what type of sleep problems you have, keep a sleep diary
for a couple of weeks. Each morning, jot down such things as the quality of
your sleep, how long you slept, and how often you woke up. Also, note
whether you snored (ask your partner or use a tape recorder) and how loudly,
whether you were tired during the day, how many naps you took, and so on.
Be sure to note anything unusual, such as feeling drowsy during an activity
you usually enjoy (such as playing tennis) or falling asleep in class. Also note
all medications and all alcohol or other mind-altering substances you take.
(Be honest! This list is only for your eyes!) Track these events for a couple of
weeks if you can. Then check your diary to see what your sleep patterns are.
Summarize your diary for your doctor and anyone else helping you with your
sleep problems.
Getting Some Shuteye the Natural Way
Whether your problem is chronic pain by itself, a sleep disorder such as
insomnia or sleep apnea (see sections on these topics earlier in this chapter),
or a combination, proven practices can aid your search for restful sleep, if
not solve the problem. Make these practices part of your daily regimen until
they become regular habits like brushing your teeth and washing behind
your ears.
 Go to sleep and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends.
 Don’t nap! It can keep you awake at night.
 Develop a regular bedtime schedule. Every night, about half an hour to
an hour before you go to bed, do the same ritual so that your body
knows it’s time to sleep. For example, walk your dog, set the coffee to
start perking at 6 a.m., brush your teeth, and then read (nothing scary or
violent!) for ten minutes before turning off the light.
 Avoid exercising within three hours of your bedtime.
 Don’t eat large meals close to bedtime.
 Remember the old coffee lover’s joke that “Sleep is a symptom of 
caffeine deprivation.” Don’t consume products that contain caffeine
after dinner. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate.
 Be moderate in drinking alcohol.
 Use your bed only for sleeping, sex, and reading no longer than 15 min-
utes before you go to sleep. No TV! No page-turner novels!
262
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

Knocking Yourself Out with Medications
Sometimes you may need a little help from prescribed medications to get 
to sleep. The following list covers the major types of drugs used to help
people sleep.
 Benzodiazepines are part of a class of drugs called hypnotics. These
drugs include Klonopin, Valium, Restoril, Prosom, Xanax, and Ativan. In
addition to being sleep aids, benzodiazepines are also used to stop teeth
grinding. These habit-forming drugs should be used only under doctor
supervision. Benzodiazepines can cause withdrawal and rebound 
insomnia.
 Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics include Ambien, Sonata, and Lunesta.
These habit-forming drugs should be used only under doctor supervi-
sion. Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics can cause withdrawal and rebound
insomnia.
 A melatonin receptor stimulator, Ramelteon (Rozerem), was approved
in July 2005 and is in a class all by itself. Ramelteon does not produce
dependence or rebound insomnia.

Treating Pain and Stress Using 
the Power of Thought
In This Chapter
 Overcoming stress-inducing thoughts
 Challenging your negative thoughts
 Adopting new ways of thinking
D
id your mother ever say to you (or maybe you say it to your own chil-
dren), “Don’t believe every little rumor that you happen to hear.” In the
same spirit, consider this tip: Don’t believe all the negative or panicky
thoughts you may have about your chronic pain. In fact, you may find that
your internal grumbles about your pain are actually making it a whole lot
worse.
People with chronic pain often have distorted, extreme, or negative thoughts
about their condition. For example, when Jim gets a migraine aura, his
thoughts are often “I’m going to become deathly ill!” or, “I know that the pain
is going to eat me up alive.” But migraines don’t kill, and they don’t devour
people either. In addition, such thoughts aren’t helpful when you have
chronic pain, and they can actually kick the pain up a few notches, the 
opposite of what you need.
Numerous studies have shown that paying attention to your thoughts about
pain can really help you. Identifying thoughts that reflect internal inaccurate
or negative beliefs and replacing them with new positive ones can help you
experience your pain more realistically — and usually less painfully. In this
chapter, you find steps to help you treat your pain using the power of
thought.
Understanding the Pain/Stress Link
Pain causes stress, which in turn causes more pain and more stress and so
on, in a downward negative spiral.

How you interpret or appraise your pain directly influences how your pain
feels. For example, doctors know that any two patients with identical damage
shown on their x-rays do not experience pain the same way. Each person has
their own experiences, beliefs, and physical condition that influence how
they feel pain. Once you discover your underlying thinking that affects your
pain, you’ll gain better control over it.
The writer Natalie Goldberg aptly says in her book Wild Mind, “Stress
believes that everything is an emergency.” The thoughts that you have under
the stress of pain are often exaggerated because your body and your mind
both think they’re in the middle of a red alert, so sound the pain klaxons! But
with chronic pain, red alert is the opposite of what you want.
Recognize that stress is heightened or reduced by how you think and then
how your body reacts to how you think. For example, if every time you
awaken with stomach pain you think, “This is going to be another bad day,”
then your negative expectation will cause the bad day to happen, just like you
anticipated. On the other hand, try thinking, “I’m going to try some things to
make me feel better,” such as taking your medicine or soaking in a hot bath.
When you think positive thoughts, the result is often that you do feel better.
You’re not as stressed, and your pain lessens.
Decreasing Stress Using Your Thoughts
Use this tactic. Observe, identify, and write down your automatic thoughts
about your pain. Carry a pen and paper with you so that you can jot them
down as you go about your daily activities.
Automatic thoughts are habitual thoughts that spring to mind, and you often
accept them unquestioningly. But many people in chronic pain have negative
automatic thoughts that need a serious spring cleaning! Use the advice in this
chapter to revamp your automatic thoughts.
Following are some examples of automatic thoughts:
 Catastrophic thinking: “I know this stomach flare-up means I have
cancer, not just irritable bowel syndrome.” Or, “I’ll never be able to
travel again because of my stomach problems.”
 All-or-nothing thinking: “I can’t do sports anymore, so there’s no point
in exercising at all.” Or “I can’t stand for long periods of time any more,
so that means that I can’t do any work at all.”
 Fortune telling (predicting the future with a negative outcome): “By
next year, I’ll be in a wheelchair.” Or “This new medicine will never
work.”
266
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 Labeling: “All doctors hate people with fibromyalgia.” Or “I move slowly
because I’m old. All old people move slowly.”
 Mind reading: “If I tell my fellow churchgoers that I get migraines, they
won’t let me join the choir.” Or “My friends have given up on me because
I’m disabled.”
These thoughts and others like them add to your pain, just like in football
when three or four players pile on the guy with the ball. Don’t pile on to your
pain!
Notice what happens to your body when automatic thoughts occur. Do your
muscles tense up? Does your posture become more stooped? Do you clench
your teeth or wring your hands? Or pace around? These stress responses
may occur when you have these negative thoughts, and they amplify your
pain. Once identified, they’re easier to change.
Challenging Negative Thoughts
Don’t automatically accept your negative automatic thoughts. Instead, ask
yourself whether they’re really valid. Are they realistic? Are they based on
fact?
For each negative thought, ask yourself these questions.
 Are my thoughts exaggerated?
 Could my thoughts be distorted?
 Are my thoughts overly negative?
 Are there any positive aspects to my thoughts? For example, if I have a
headache today, is it just a minor one?
While you’re challenging your thoughts, don’t chastise yourself if any of them
seem out-of-whack. Blaming yourself just adds to the stress and pain.
For all the negative automatic thoughts and their challenges you identify,
create new beliefs to replace them with that could change your thinking. For
example, Fred, age 83, has a bad knee and thinks of himself as old and
decrepit. But Fred could think of himself as a healthy older person (which 
he is) who happens to have one bad knee. (The other one is still just fine.)
267
Chapter 21: Treating Pain and Stress Using the Power of Thought

Creating New Automatic Thoughts
Replace your old negative thoughts with new ones. Here’s an example of
more positive thinking. “When I’m in pain, I can still do a lot. I can work on
my craft project. I can also call my friend in my chronic pain group.” Another
example: “When I’m in pain, I can do more than sit in front of the TV. Instead,
I can do a crossword puzzle or read the newspaper, and use my brain.”
Practice using these new thoughts in place of the old ones.
Many good techniques are effective at reducing stress, such as distraction,
framing, and expressive writing, all which can effectively counter your nega-
tive thoughts. Read about these techniques in Chapter 22.
Adopting new thoughts as habits
Keep it up, and your new thinking patterns will become habitual. Changing
your thoughts can be hard but doable! And it’s well-worth every effort you
make, because these new thoughts will often translate into considerably less
pain.
Your new thoughts should be based on reality. For example, if you were just
diagnosed with cancer, saying to yourself, “I’m getting better and better
every day in every way,” isn’t appropriate. Your mind will respond with some-
thing like, “I’m not getting better, I’m getting worse!”
Instead, use thinking that is more along the lines, of “I’m going to do every-
thing I can to become as healthy as possible.” This thought is positive and
realistic.
Challenge Your Thoughts worksheet
To work on challenging your negative thoughts, copy the worksheet in 
Table 21-1 and keep notes for a couple of days (or longer). This process can
help you develop new patterns of thinking.
First write down the event that has set off the negative thought, then the
thought itself, and, last but not least, a positive statement that you’re going
to use instead.
Use the example in Table 21-2 as a guide.

hen you have chronic pain, you’re also very stressed out, and too
much stress is bad for your body. Stress causes clenched muscles, an
upset stomach, and — at its peak — a heart beating so fast you can feel the
thump, thump, thumping in your chest. Even when things are at an even keel,
if you are overly stressed, you still feel awful. And when a situation heats up,
then watch out! You’re in stress overdrive.
In this chapter, we share many ways that you can minimize stress — and
therefore the pain — in your life.
Exploring Stress
Stress is the feeling that the demands in your life are greater and stronger
than your physical and personal abilities and resources to cope with them.
It’s the condition you experience when you feel that you’ve lost control of
your health or your circumstances. When you’re stressed out for whatever
reason, your body releases the same hormones into your bloodstream that
would be pumped out if you were being chased by a big black bear. Stress
sets off your body’s fight-or-flight response, as if you had to either fight that
furry beast or run as fast as you can away from it.
Stress hormones speed up your heart and breathing. In addition, as your body
prepares for battle, your muscles tighten. Your liver secretes glucose so that
your body will have needed fuel to either struggle in place or run like crazy.
Your body also produces sweat to cool itself down. These examples are only a
few body processes in full play when you’re having a major stress attack.

Stress doesn’t occur solely in response to immediate dangers, such as ram-
paging bears. Just as a person can have chronic pain, she can have chronic
stress. Long-term challenges, such as coping with chronic pain, can produce
a low-level, long-term stress that simply wears you out and wears you down.
That’s why you need to work on easing your stress levels.
The American Psychological Association (APA) has identified three major
types of stress: acute stress, episodic acute stress, and chronic stress. Your
chronic pain can cause one or all three of these forms of stress, which are
described in the following sections.
Acute stress
When you experience a traumatic event, acute stress is your instantaneous
response. You may have been injured or witnessed a violent event. You may
have been fired or betrayed. Whatever the incident, your initial response was
272
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 
Sizing up stress
If you’re stressed out, you’re not alone! One-
third of Americans live with extreme stress, and
nearly half of Americans (48 percent) believe
that their stress has increased over the past five
years, according to a 2007 poll conducted for
the American Psychological Association (APA).
Chronic pain also causes stress, and your pain
can elicit physical and psychological stress
symptoms. For example, the APA poll showed
that many people experience both physical
symptoms (77 percent) and psychological symp-
toms (73 percent) that are directly related to
stress in the last month.
Physical symptoms that the poll respondents
reported were fatigue (51 percent); headache
(44 percent); upset stomach (34 percent);
muscle tension (30 percent); change in appetite
(23 percent); teeth grinding (17 percent); change
in sex drive (15 percent); and feeling dizzy 
(13 percent).
Psychological symptoms reported included irri-
tability or anger (50 percent); nervousness 
(45 percent); a lack of energy (45 percent); and
sadness, or feeling as though you could cry (35
percent). In addition, almost half (48 percent) of
Americans report lying awake at night due to
their excessive stress levels.
Many people cope with stress in unhealthy
ways. For example, four in ten Americans 
(43 percent) say they overeat or eat unhealthy
foods to manage their stress, while about one-
third (36 percent) skipped a meal in the last
month because of stress. Those who drink (39
percent) or smoke cigarettes (19 percent) were
also more likely to engage in these unhealthy
behaviors during periods of high stress.
Some people cope with their stress in more
positive ways; for example, significant numbers
of Americans report listening to music (54 per-
cent); reading (52 percent); exercising or walk-
ing (50 percent); spending time with family 
and friends (40 percent); and praying (34 per-
cent). These behaviors are the kind you should
emulate!

fear and a feeling of vulnerability. Fortunately, acute stress is brief and usu-
ally doesn’t do extensive physical and emotional damage unless it turns into
the longer-lasting response of episodic acute stress or chronic stress.
Interestingly, acute stress, such as a near-miss automobile accident, actually
temporarily relieves chronic pain ostensibly due to the release of endorphins.
Episodic acute stress
This type of stress usually occurs for Type A personalities. Type As are said
to be excessively competitive, aggressive, impatient, and have a harrying
sense of time urgency.
Constant worrying can also cause this type of stress. Worrywarts, for exam-
ple, see disaster around every corner. If you’re constantly worrying about
your chronic pain or other major stressors in your life, then you need to 
chill out!
The symptoms of acute and episodic acute stress are the same. However, if
you have the symptoms during episodic stress, they usually last longer than
symptoms triggered by acute stress alone.
These symptoms include
 Persistent tension headaches
 Migraines
 Hypertension (high blood pressure)
 Chest pain
 Heart disease
Chronic stress
Chronic stress is the grinding strain that wears you down, day after day, year
after year. Chronic stress results when you feel trapped by a miserable situa-
tion. It’s the stress of poverty, of working in a despised job, of living in a war
zone. And far too often, it’s the stress of chronic pain.
According to the APA, a terrible aspect of chronic stress is that you can actu-
ally get used to it. It starts to feel like your situation is hopeless, and it’s just
the way things are. You don’t realize that things could actually change for the
better. The APA literature on chronic stress says, “People are immediately
aware of acute stress because it is new; they ignore chronic stress because it
is old, familiar, and sometimes, almost comfortable.”

Coping with Stress and Pain
Wouldn’t it be great if you could just inhabit a stress-free zone and eliminate
all your troubles from your life? Say good-bye to the jitters and the stomach
aches. And especially say goodbye to the relentlessness of it all!
But when you have chronic pain, you have to deal every day with the stress it
creates. The best approach is to curb the stress as much as you can and
when you can. Fortunately, numerous techniques can help you alleviate
stress. From meditation to yoga, the techniques described in the following
sections can help reduce both your stress and pain.
Using guided imagery
Guided imagery can help you use your imagination to calm the stress that
reality brings to your life every day. This technique involves creating positive
images, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings with your mind. An instructor —
in person or on audiotape — guides you through the process of forming your
own imagery. One commonly used technique is to imagine a safe, comfort-
able place, such as a beach on a pleasant clear day or a peaceful chapel in
the autumn woods.
Guided imagery is frequently used in hospital settings due to the success of a
study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic in the mid-1990s. Clinic researchers
found that employing guided imagery reduced their patients’ anxiety and
pain, as well as their use of narcotic medication both before and after
surgery. The technique has become so popular that Kaiser Permanente, a
major health maintenance organization, provides patients and the public
with free downloads of guided imagery to use during medical procedures and
for overall wellness (http://members.kaiserpermanente.org/redi-
rects/listen). Guided imagery tapes are also widely available through
bookstores and the web.
Meditating through the hurting
Meditation is a group of techniques rooted in spiritual traditions. Many
people use meditation for stress and pain reduction and to promote wellness.
When meditating, you use one of a range of techniques, such as repeating a
word over and over again (a mantra) or paying attention to your breathing.
These approaches help focus your attention and quiet down your stress-
related thoughts. No one really knows how it works, but for many people,
meditation leads to physical relaxation, pain reduction, and psychological
balance.
274
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

All techniques used for meditation have four elements in common:
 A quiet location with as few distractions as possible
 A comfortable posture
 A focus of attention, such as an object in the room
 A feeling of letting go so that any distractions come and go gently, and
your focus does not remain on them
Here’s a sample meditation exercise to try at home:
1. Find a peaceful place where you’ll be free of interruptions.
2. Choose a focus word, a phrase, or an image you find relaxing.
Examples of words are “grace” and ooohmmm.” (Some practitioners
believe that the mantra should be syllables or words that have no mean-
ing to you. That is why many people use “ooohmmm” or “aaaaummm.”)
Example of phrases you can use are “May I be well,” or “May I have
patience and gratitude.” Examples of images to concentrate on include
statues of a spiritual figure or a photograph of the sun.
3. Sit quietly in a comfortable position.
The easiest posture is a comfortable sitting position, with your spine
straight and erect. If you lie down, you’ll probably fall asleep, and you
can’t meditate when you’re unconscious!
4. Close your eyes and relax your muscles, starting at your head, work-
ing down your body to your feet.
5. Breathe slowly and naturally, focusing on your breathing or a word,
phrase, or image; continue for 10 to 20 minutes.
If your mind wanders, that’s OK. Gently return your focus to your
breathing and to the word, phrase or image you’ve previously selected.
6. After the time is up, sit quietly for a few minutes with your eyes
closed; then open your eyes and sit in silence for a few more minutes.
Relaxing your breathing
Stress causes rapid, shallow breathing. If you slow down and deepen your
breathing, you can reduce the effects of stress. Here’s one frequently used
approach to achieve this goal:
1. Inhale.
With your mouth closed and your shoulders relaxed, inhale as slowly
and deeply as you can, to the count of six. At the same time, push your
stomach out. Allow the air to fill your diaphragm.
275
Chapter 22: Relaxing, Praying, and Creating

2. Hold.
Keep the air in your lungs as you slowly count to four.
3. Exhale.
Release the air through your mouth as you slowly count to six.
4. Repeat the inhale-hold-exhale cycle three to five times.
Driving to distraction
Multitasking is good, but many people take it too far and ratchet up their
stress to bad levels that increase their chronic pain.
You can concentrate on only so many things at one time: organizing your To-
Do List for the next day, preparing dinner, finding your son’s soccer gear, all
the while talking to your mother on the phone. Multitasking too much is a
setup for burning the rice! When your brain is crowded with too many tasks,
attention to some things will inevitably drop off. You can turn around this
principle and use it in a positive way to manage pain.
Sidetrack your mind away from your hurting by focusing on things that com-
pete for attention in your brain. The approach is called distraction. The idea is
to find activities that you can be totally absorbed in. Try the activity at least
an hour every day and see how you feel.
For example, Elizabeth Vierck (one of your authors) had a difficult hip
replacement surgery and subsequently spent a week transfixed by her hus-
band’s fish tank, watching the clown fish swim in circles. It was fun. It was
soothing. And it helped ease the pain. Other people have tried activities like
learning to count to 400 in Chinese or teaching a child a hobby, such as
sewing or whittling.
Here are a few other ideas that may help you distract yourself from your
pain:
 Read or listen to a book or listen to music.
 Do Sudoko puzzles, crosswords, or jigsaw puzzles.
 On your computer, go to http://zefrank.com to play games, draw
flowers, or practice meditation by watching a flower move slowly across
your screen.
 Take up creative pursuits, such as needlework, painting with acrylics, or
learning carpentry.
 If you’re physically fit enough, take up a new activity, such as golf or
bocce ball.
276
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 If you don’t have a pet, consider adopting a puppy or kitten. (Or an adult
dog or cat, which are usually already trained and less stressful!) They
demand attention, are by nature distracting, and are also entertaining
and funny.
Using self-hypnosis
The goal of self-hypnosis is to draw your attention away from your pain and
help you relax. You can also use it to change negative thoughts. In fact, if you
try this stress-reduction technique, make sure that you use only positive
words and images throughout your self-hypnosis experience.
You may want to consult a certified hypnotherapist to teach you specific
techniques for using self-hypnosis for pain reduction. The National Board for
Certified Clinical Hypnotherapists has an online directory available at
www.natboard.com. In addition, many self-hypnosis instructional programs
are available for purchase on audio through bookstores or online.
Keep in mind that hypnosis typically involves four stages: induction, deepen-
ing, suggestion, and termination.
 In the induction stage, you achieve a deep state of relaxation.
 The second stage, deepening, involves increasing your hypnotic state.
 The third stage is suggestion. Tell yourself soothing phrases that will
help your pain, such as “The muscles of my back are totally relaxed.”
 Termination, where you end the hypnosis, is the last stage of the
process.
The following steps walk you through a self-hypnosis script to try. You’ll want
to have about a half hour available.
1. Find a quiet, comfortable spot where you can avoid distractions.
2. Choose a suggestion that will help your pain. Whisper it silently to
yourself.
For example, try something like, “My muscles are relaxing, and I am
calm” or “I feel warmth soothing my joints.”
3. Take a deep breath, hold the breath for a count of three, and then
exhale with a sigh; repeat three times.
Let go all your tension when you breathe out.
4. Take another deep breath through your nose, hold for a count of five,
and let it go through pursed lips; repeat three times.
Really let go on the exhale, releasing all your body tension. You should
begin to relax.
277
Chapter 22: Relaxing, Praying, and Creating

5. Repeat to yourself the suggestion you chose in Step 1 and imagine
yourself in that state.
For example, if you say to yourself, “My body is relaxing,” imagine your-
self as relaxed, with your arms and legs limp.
6. Focus on the spots on your body where you have pain.
7. Deepen your hypnotic state.
You can try several techniques:
• Repeat to yourself, “I am going deeper and deeper into a hypnotic
state.”
• Use imagery: Tell yourself that your eyelids are getting heavier and
heavier. Imagine this wonderful feeling.
Repeat the suggestion to yourself several times.
8. Tell yourself that you’re coming out of your trance and give yourself a
positive message.
For example, “I will count from one to five. When I reach five, my eyelids
will open, and I will be wide awake and relaxed, and I will be in less pain.
Healing with your own hands: 
Self-massage
Of course, you’d probably prefer to have a professional give you a massage
than do it yourself. Who wouldn’t? But, if you’re like most people, you don’t
always have the time or money to see a massage therapist. Self-massage is a
great option at these times. (If your insurance covers massage, consider
yourself lucky! But you still may want to do self-massage in between your
appointments with a therapist. It will help keep those sore muscles relaxed!)
The idea behind self-massage is to rub and stroke the areas on your body
that a massage therapist would stroke, concentrating on the most painful
areas. You probably do some self-massage without even thinking about it —
rubbing your head when you have a headache, stroking your shoulders after
hunching over a keyboard all day, or massaging your sore feet after a long
hike.
Following are some self-massage ideas to help you get started. You also 
may want to get a massage therapist to instruct you in these moves. See
Chapter 13 for information on how to find a licensed therapist.
278
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

 Back massage: Find a tennis ball and sit in a straight back chair. Place
the tennis ball on any sore spots on your back. Lean into the chair. Lean
your back into the ball. Take ten deep breaths. Repeat at least once
more.
 Head massage: Spread your hands out on your scalp. Massage in a
clockwise motion, beginning at your hairline and moving backward to
the nape of your neck. Take deep breaths and massage as you breathe.
Change direction.
 Foot massage: Wash your feet and put a light coat of lotion or oil on
them. Sit on a comfortable chair and rest one foot on the thigh of the
other leg. Thread the fingers of one hand through the toes of your foot,
spreading out your toes. Place the palm of your hand against the bottom
of your foot. Rotate the joints of your forefoot back and forth for one
minute with the palm of your hand. Repeat with the other foot.
Next, hold your ankle with one hand and gently rotate your foot with the
other hand. Start with small circles and make then increasingly larger.
Switch directions. Repeat with the other foot.
 Neck massage: Clasp your fingers behind your neck, pressing the heels
of your palms into your neck on either side of your spinal column. Move
the heels of your hands up and down slowly.
Then place the fingers of your right hand on the muscle along the left
side of your neck just below the base of your skull (the trapezius
muscle). Press into that muscle, tilt your head to the left, and rub down-
ward toward your shoulder. Repeat three times and then switch sides.
 Shoulder squeeze: Cross your arms over your chest and grab a shoul-
der with either hand. Squeeze each shoulder and release three times.
Move your hands down your arms, squeeze, and release.
Praying and using other 
spiritual techniques
Prayer can be a powerful pain reducer for those who practice it. A USA Today
poll found that 59 percent of its respondents reported that they used prayer
to control pain. Of the people who use prayer for pain, 90 percent said it
works well, and 51 percent said it works “very well.” Many people find that
repeating a word or prayer many times is soothing. Choose a prayer that will
work best for you based on your religious beliefs.
Some people who worry a lot say that it helps to give over their problems to
God or a higher power to solve. By letting go of your problems, you can work
toward relaxing.
279
Chapter 22: Relaxing, Praying, and Creating

Ironically, many people find that when they pray, solutions to their problems
suddenly occur to them. Before praying, the intense worry was blocking the
answers that they sought.
Journaling for wellness and 
pain management
Many people find that writing their thoughts in a journal relieves their stress
and helps them manage their pain better. The concept behind journaling for
stress relief and pain management is to write specifically about your
thoughts, feelings, and frustrations on your pain, health, and related issues.
Journaling also includes writing about positive things. For example, maybe
your pain condition has brought you closer to your family or you’ve started a
new hobby to replace old ones you can no longer perform. Write down the
positives as well so that you can celebrate the good!
Think of your journal as a nonjudgmental best friend or therapist, to whom
you can pour your heart out. Also, keep in mind that your journal should be
different from your pain diary. (For information about keeping a pain diary,
see Chapter 17.) Think of your pain diary as a spreadsheet where you keep
details about your pain and overall health, while your journal is an open and
honest conversation with yourself.
Journaling can be done with pen and paper or on a computer. If you’re a per-
fectionist, let it go! Don’t worry about using correct grammar or spelling or
perfect penmanship. Journaling is for your eyes only.
Laughing through your stress and pain
“There’s nothing like a good laugh.” How many times have you said that to
yourself (or your best friend) after a particularly good joke? The great editor
Norman Cousins famously discovered the therapeutic effects of laughter
when he developed heart disease and arthritis. He described his laughter-as-
therapy approach in the 1979 book Anatomy of an Illness.
While the pain-ridden Cousins was in the hospital, he watched Marx Brothers
films. “I made the joyous discovery that ten minutes of genuine belly laughter
had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free
sleep,” he reported. Cousins said that “Laughter is inner jogging.”
280
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

Since Cousins’ time (he died in 1990), the power of laughter as an anecdote
for pain and stress has caught on around the world. The Laughter Tour
(www.worldlaughtertour.com) is very popular in rehab centers and 
long-term care facilities. The Laughter Arts and Science Foundation
(www.laughterfoundation.org) supports and creates programs that cap-
italize on laughter to promote harmony in the world. The Association for
Applied and Therapeutic Humor (www.aath.org) is a network of laughter
authorities and enthusiasts. And the International Society for Humor Studies
(www.hnu.edu/ishs) is a scholarly and professional organization dedicated
to the advancement of humor research.
Interest in laughter is based in part on its positive effects on health and pain
reduction. For example, using laughter-provoking movies to gauge the effect
of emotions on cardiovascular health, researchers at the University of
Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore showed that laughter is linked to
the healthy functioning of blood vessels. Laughter appears to cause the
tissue that forms the inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, to dilate
or expand in order to increase blood flow — a very good thing!
281
Chapter 22: Relaxing, Praying, and Creating
Tips to bring humor into your life
Laugh more and feel better! Watch comedy on
DVD, TV, and even on your computer. Most TV
comedy shows include highlights of popular
episodes on their Web pages. For example, the
site for the late-night host, Jay Leno, shows the
clip “Impressing Ed Asner” from one of his
episodes in which a spry 90-year-old woman
does a dance routine that ends with her doing
impressive splits. Watch this piece, and not only
will you laugh in pure delight at the enthusiasm
of the performer, you’ll also cheer in awe. (And,
you will forget your pain, if only for a minute.)
Here are a few more ideas:
 Go to comedy clubs. Most large cities have
comedy clubs featuring standup comics.
Many acts are top-notch; most great come-
dians, such as Jerry Seinfeld and Tim Allen,
got their starts in comedy clubs.
 Read or listen to funny books. Many good
comedy writers can tickle your funny bone:
Steve Martin, Woody Allen, Whoopi
Goldberg, and Ellen DeGeneres, to name
just a few. You can also listen to them on CD
while in your car. A great resource for 
purchasing CDs designed for laughs is
Laugh.com at http://laughstore.
stores.yahoo.net.
 Check out funny things wherever you go
and whatever you do. If the comic section
in your local paper doesn’t interest you, try
the Web. Some funny sites are www.
funny2.com; www.ahajokes.com;
www.comedycentral.com/jokes/
index.jhtml; 
and 
www.knock-
knock-joke.com.
 Be funny. Make yourself and other people
laugh. If it doesn’t come naturally, take a
class from the Laugh Tour (www.world
laughtertour.com; 1-800-NOW-LAFF).
They travel around the country teaching
people to laugh. Or read the classic and still
great How To Be Funny by Steve Allen,
(Prometheus) the founder of late-night TV.

When the same group of study volunteers was shown a movie that produced
mental stress, their blood vessel linings constricted, reducing blood flow — a
very bad thing.
Other research has shown that laughter
 Lowers blood pressure
 Increases vascular blood flow and oxygenation of the blood, which
assists healing
 Exercises your diaphragm, abdominal, respiratory, and other muscles
 Reduces levels of stress hormones in your body, which surge when you
feel stress, anger, or hostility. These hormones cause all sorts of harm in
your body: They can suppress your immune system, obstruct your
arteries, and raise blood pressure.
 Increases natural killer cells (such as T and B cells) that destroy tumors
and viruses
Humming through your stress and pain
Using music to soothe pain isn’t a new phenomenon. The medical community
recognized its success during the first and second world wars, when nurses
used music with wounded soldiers in veterans’ hospitals.
More recently, U.S. researchers tested the effects of music on 60 patients who
had endured years of chronic pain. Those who listened to music reported
decreases of up to 21 percent in their pain levels and up to 25 percent in
depression levels, compared to those who did not listen to music. They had
suffered from osteoarthritis, disc problems, and rheumatoid arthritis for an
average of more than six years.
Music is an individual taste. What soothes one person may jangle the nerves
of another. But if listening to the music of your choice gives you relief from
pain and stress, then we say, “Listen up!”
Playing with crayons and clay: 
Art therapy
Art as a healing tool is mainstream in medicine. In a 2004 survey, the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations found that about
2,000 hospitals nationwide offer some kind of art programming or therapy
(including music).
282
Part IV: Managing Your Pain with Lifestyle 

Recent research has underscored the benefits that practicing art can have for
pain reduction and other symptoms. A study of cancer patients published in
the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management found that participating in art
programs reduces uncomfortable symptoms in cancer patients. The
researchers found reductions in eight of nine symptoms: pain, tiredness,
depression, anxiety, drowsiness, lack of appetite, well-being, and shortness of
breath. Nausea was the only symptom that didn’t change as a result of partic-
ipating in the program.
You don’t have to be a gifted artist to practice art for pain reduction. In fact,
the purpose is to paint as you did as a child — to be distracted by the
process of creating something from within yourself. Use any medium you
want, including crayons, clay, or colored pencils.
To try your hand at art to reduce pain, you may want to start by locating an
art therapist in your local area. Contact the American Art Therapy
Association, Inc., 5999 Stevenson Ave., Alexandria, VA 22304; phone
888-290-0878; e-mail info@arttherapy.org.

Understanding
Pain Throughout
the Life Cycle

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we give you practical advice on detecting
and managing chronic pain during three stages of the
lifecycle: childhood, the later years, and during the end 
of life. Pain during each of these stages requires different
treatments and solutions than during adulthood. For
example, the types and dosages of drugs that you can give
a child with chronic pain differ greatly from those an adult
can take. And the same is true people over age 65.
So, if you have a child with chronic pain, if you or a loved
one is over age 65, or if you (or a loved one) have a 
terminal illness, this part is for you.

I
f you have a child in chronic pain, you’re all too familiar with the heart-
break and challenges of seeing a kid who’s hurting. And you’re not 
alone — many other parents know exactly how you feel. The American Pain
Society estimates that 15 to 20 percent of children are affected by chronic
pain. Many experts say that this number actually is an underestimate
because a lot of pain in kids goes undiagnosed.
Many conditions, including cystic fibrosis, chronic headaches, and cancer,
cause chronic pain in children. But kids experience the pain these conditions
cause much differently than adults. For example, until about age 3, children
don’t think abstractly about pain and have no experience to draw on to 
realize that the pain of a needle prick will go away fast. To the child, it hurts
right now! And it hurts a lot! And, that’s really, really scary!
This chapter gives you tips to detect the severity of your child’s pain and
covers the medicines commonly used to treat pain in children.
Understanding How Children 
Experience Pain
Until the last few decades, pain was often ignored in infants. It’s incredible 
to think about now, but physicians believed that infants didn’t feel pain as
intensely as older children or adults do (or they believed that babies didn’t
feel pain at all). The medical profession assumed that an infant’s nervous
system was just not mature enough to transmit pain the way that an older
child’s or an adult’s does. But the truth is that infants can feel pain. However,
they don’t know how to tell you about pain and don’t show it the same way
that adults do.

Children also don’t have any life experience to draw on to compare one type
of pain to another. In addition, a child’s pain may be ignored because she may
not be able to tell an adult about it — she doesn’t have the words to describe
“pain in the sinuses” — or she may try to hide her pain because she’s afraid
of the events that may be set in motion if she does talk about it.
For example, maybe the last time she complained about something that hurt,
her dad took her to the doctor’s office, and a very tall stranger drew blood
from her arm — and the idea of going to the doctor’s office and going through
that ordeal again is a lot scarier than the headache she’s having at the
moment.
Whether a child feels pain in relationship to a chronic illness and how she
expresses it depends on the individual child and the disease process. For
example, some children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have pain, and
some other (luckier) kids don’t. Some children will also keep playing in spite
of their pain, while others withdraw or scream bloody murder — and they 
all have the same level of pain.
Measuring Pain in Children
With so many ways that a child can respond to pain, how do you tell what’s
really happening with your kid? Fortunately, health professionals have 
developed methods for measuring pain in children:
 Self-reported (subjective) pain, which is assessed by asking questions
and using scales. (Experts say that children 6 to 7 years and older are 
as accurate as adults at assessing pain using self-reporting methods.)

parents.html. The Parenting Corner of the
AAP offers many helpful hints on a broad array
of topics. In addition, you can search its data-
base to locate a pediatrician.

 Physiologic measures of pain, noted by signs such as elevated blood
pressure and sweating.
 Behavioral signs of pain, observed by contorted facial expressions 
and crying.
Measuring self-reported pain
To make it easier for your child to describe her pain and help you determine
how much pain your child is experiencing, try one of the following tech-
niques. To use these measures, your child must be talking and able to answer
questions — it won’t work on baby!
 Ask your child to draw or describe the color of her pain. Give your 
child a box of crayons and some paper and ask her to draw her pain.
Children’s pain drawings are usually very detailed and emotionally 
powerful, and they often use red or black to draw areas where they feel
the most pain.
 Use the chips game to determine pain. Note: For this method, your 
child must be able to understand that adding one thing to another thing
results in creating something bigger. Use four identical chips — poker
chips or checker pieces are fine. Tell your child that you want to talk to
her about the pain she’s having right now. Then line the chips across
(not up and down) in a row on a kitchen table, tray, or other flat surface.
Starting at the far left, describe the chips to your child. Say something
like, “This chip is a little hurt.” (If your child doesn’t understand the con-
cept of “hurt” very well, use words she does understand, such as “This
chip is a little owie.”) Point to the next chip and say “This chip is more
hurt.” Point to the next one and say “This one is a lot of hurt.” Then point
to the last one and say, “This chip is the most hurt you can have!” Then
ask your child, “Show me how many chips you feel like right now?”
Make sure that you understand what your child is expressing by saying
something like, “Oh, that means you have a little hurt” if she picks only
the first chip. If she then says, “No, hurts a lot,” then re-explain the 
concept one more time. (Don’t try a third time if it still doesn’t work. 
Use one of the other measures.)
 Use the faces scale to determine pain. Particularly after about age 5,
some children describe their pain accurately using the faces scales,
such as the one shown in Chapter 17. If you use this scale, try using
these descriptions for the five faces:
• First face: Doesn’t hurt at all.
• Second face: Hurts a little.
• Third face: Hurts more.
• Fourth face: Hurts a lot.
• Fifth face: Hurts the most.
289
Chapter 23: Pain in Children

Reading physiologic measures of pain
An increased heart rate, sweating, an elevated pulse or blood pressure, 
or rapid breathing can all indicate that a child is in pain and feeling stress.
However, these signs must be used along with the self-reporting and behav-
ioral measures because these physical responses can be caused by other 
factors, such as anxiety or hunger. And, just as in adults, infants in pain 
sometimes don’t show any abnormalities in heart rate or blood pressure.
Reading behavior to detect pain
Children show pain by crying and pulling away from the cause, such as a
needle or catheter that hurts. They also may hold their breath; clench their
fists; show pain, anxiety, or fear on their faces; and hold or stroke the area
where it hurts. Children in pain may also be less active and sleep more or
less than normally. They may refuse to eat.
The most reliable way to tell pain in an infant is by facial expression. The 
following expressions show an infant is in pain: quivering chin, eyes squeezed
shut, mouth wide open, and grimacing. An inability to be comforted and
crying with a tone that is higher and louder than usual also may indicate
pain. Cries from pain also tend to be sharp, not melodious.
Detecting Chronic Illness in Your Child
A myriad of medical conditions can cause chronic pain conditions in chil-
dren. If you think that your child is in pain and notice any of the following
signs, report them to your pediatrician or family doctor, because they may 
be symptoms of a chronic or serious illness.
 Breathing problems such as coughing or wheezing
 Marked changes in weight, behavior, sleep patterns, eating, or drinking
 Vomiting or diarrhea that doesn’t improve
 Crankiness and crying
 Rashes that don’t improve
Assessing Pain Medications for Children
Most drugs used to treat pain haven’t been studied in children, and the FDA
doesn’t give guidelines for giving painkillers to children. So, doctors must
extrapolate from studies performed with adults.
290
Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 

In part, because of the lack of guidelines, many health professionals are
afraid of overdosing a child, so, they sometimes don’t give them enough
medicine to handle the pain.
Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and opioids are used most often for pain control
in children. However, ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), such as Motrin, are not recommended for infants younger
than 6 months old. (Their livers can’t metabolize it.) Pain medicines for 
children are available as lollipops, syrups, or nasal drops, which can make
administration easier.
Don’t give your child Motrin and Tylenol at the same time or within the time
on the dosage schedule given to you in this chapter, by the drug’s manufac-
turer, or by your pediatrician. In other words, if the bottle for your child’s
Motrin says, “give every six hours,” don’t give him either drug during that 
six-hour period. Giving your child Tylenol and Motrin close to each other in
time can cause her to have kidney failure.
Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the most frequently used OTC pain reliev-
ers in children. They’re effective for both acute and chronic pain. The two
OTC drugs are similar in their ability to relieve moderate to severe pain, but
ibuprofen is better at reducing fever. The dosage to give your child is based
on weight.
Acetaminophen
Administering the correct dosage of acetaminophen is extremely important
to avoid accidentally overdosing your child. For example, giving your child
too many OTC drugs that include acetaminophen (Tylenol and Datril) can
damage his liver. Not only is the drug sold under the brand name of Tylenol
(and other names), but it’s also available in many cough and cold products.
Be sure to read the labels on all OTC drugs your child will be taking before
administering them and also total the amount of acetaminophen in them.
Don’t exceed the recommended dosage even though the acetaminophen
comes from different sources. Also, don’t give your child acetaminophen for
more than the days recommended by your pediatrician.
If your child is prescribed a drug that includes acetaminophen, ask the phar-
macist how much acetaminophen is included in the drug and whether it’s
okay to also give the child OTC painkillers.
An overdose of acetaminophen can cause liver damage. The signs of liver
damage include abnormally yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, light-
colored stools, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. The signs are similar to
the symptoms of the flu, so they easily can go unnoticed.

Dosages may be repeated every four hours, but they should not be given
more than 5 times in 24 hours. (Note: Milliliter is abbreviated as ml; 5 ml
equals 1 teaspoon [tsp].)
Don’t use household teaspoons, which can vary in size. Instead use the 
medicine spoon or syringe provided by the pharmacy (usually for free).
Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen works better than acetaminophen in treating high fevers (103° F or
higher). However, ibuprofen should be given only to children older than 6
months (see Table 23-2). Never give ibuprofen to a child who is dehydrated
or vomiting because it can cause renal failure. Dosages may be repeated
every 6 to 8 hours, but should not be given more than 4 times in 24 hours.
If your child has kidney disease, asthma, an ulcer, or another chronic illness,
ask your pediatrician whether ibuprofen is safe. Don’t give your child ibupro-
fen or acetaminophen if he’s taking any other pain reliever or fever reducer,
unless your pediatrician says it’s okay to do so.

Other pain-reducing options
The two opioids used most often in children are morphine (MS Contin) and
Fentanyl (Duragesic). However, many doctors are reluctant to prescribe these
drugs because of the lack of research on side effects in children. Opioids are
available in pills for swallowing, tablets to put under the tongue, rectal sup-
positories, nasal sprays, intravenous shots, and subcutaneous injections.
In addition, children who are 4- to 6-years-old in extremely severe pain can,
with supervision from an adult, use patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). This
implanted device can be triggered when pain occurs and doesn’t allow more
than a specific level of medication to be released. Older children can often
use PCAs without supervision. (See Chapter 14 for information on PCAs.)
Prescription drugs
Unfortunately, no research shows the effectiveness of giving children 
prescription drugs, such as antidepressants and anti-epileptics, which are
often used to treat chronic pain in adults. (See Chapter 14 for information 
for adults regarding taking these types of drugs for chronic pain.) However,
many doctors do prescribe the following drugs for pain control in children:
 Anti-anxiety medications, such as lorazepam (Ativan) and diazepam
(Valium), to enhance the effects of opioids
 Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), to treat chronic
pain and headaches
 Corticosteroids to eliminate inflammation and bone pain
 Anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and gabapentin
(Neurontin), to treat neuropathies. (See Chapter 11 for information 
on neuropathies.)
 Neuroleptics, which are antipsychotic drugs with sedative and 
pain-killing effects, to help relieve cancer pain and other severe pain
 Anesthetics, such as the topical painkiller EMLA cream, which is 
available for children over 1 month old and is given ahead of time, to
reduce pain caused by medical procedures

H
ave you heard of ageism? It’s prejudice against older people, and it’s
partially reflected in society’s worship of youth, as well as its anxiety
and horror over wrinkles and graying hair. Strangely, most people wish 
for a long life, and yet they don’t seem to want to think about becoming old.
(How you achieve long life without actually aging is a mystery.)
Most people (including some doctors!) have preconceptions of older age. One
of them is that getting old means you’re supposed to live with aches and pains.
Well, it’s true you’re more likely to have arthritis and other pain-inducing 
disorders as you age. However, chronic pain isn’t inevitable, and it’s caused 
by an actual disease or disorder, not by whatever age you are. If you’re older,
you don’t have to let your aches and pains bench you altogether, nor should
your doctor assume that you should accept all pain as normal. Fight back! You
can take action against chronic pain. This chapter offers suggestions for older
people in pain, as well as for the people who love them.
What is meant by older Americans, senior patients, or seniors? These are all
terms that generally apply to people age 65 and older, a common definition 
of the elderly in the United States.
Older People Have Real Pain
Many doctors say that a lot of senior patients deny that they have pain. 
Even people who are bent over, stiff, and in obvious discomfort may deny
that they’re in pain. When asked if they hurt, they say, “I’m fine” or “At 
my age, who can complain?” But if doctors probe a little further, many older
patients say that they “always” feel stiff and sore.

Sometimes older people have adapted society’s ageist beliefs and expect
aching and discomfort to appear or accelerate as their birthdays stack up. So
they don’t report it to their doctors. Their thinking is, “Of course, I’m in pain.
I’m old!” Other older individuals think that admitting they’re in pain is a sign
of weakness. And others fear the side effects of drugs, particularly narcotics,
used to treat pain.
The consequences of these attitudes are all bad. Neglecting pain means a life
of discomfort, when this pain could be greatly reduced with the help of a
physician, other health-care professionals, and pain-relieving treatments and
techniques. If you’re an older person or someone who loves an older person,
don’t accept that older people are in pain solely because they’re old. There
may be other reasons for their pain.
According to the American Geriatrics Society, arthritis is the most common
cause of pain in people over age 65. Circulatory problems, shingles, and
other types of nerve damage, bowel diseases, and cancer are also other
common causes of chronic pain in older people. In addition, muscle pain is
also quite common. Conditions that contribute to muscle pain in older
people are fibromyalgia and myofascial pain.
Admittedly, while it’s not a given, pain is common during the later years. Two
in three seniors in the United States say that pain prevents them from carry-
ing out routine activities, such as cooking, housework, hobbies, and garden-
ing. If you’re age 65 or older, you may be wondering, “Why us? We finally have
some time off from the daily grind of work, but now we have trouble getting
around the grocery store and running the vacuum cleaner.”
It may not seem fair, but many seniors have multiple medical conditions —
arthritis, back problems, gastrointestinal problems, and other conditions that
cause chronic pain.
Here’s the good news: While chronic pain is far too common in older age, it is
not inevitable.
Many studies have shown that older people are often undertreated for pain,
which means they’re either given no pain medicine or are administered
extremely low dosages that are ineffective. Some physicians are afraid to give
narcotics to older people with severe pain from cancer, back pain, and other
ailments because the doctors believe patients may get addicted.
In contrast, we agree with many experts who believe that severe pain should
be treated with appropriate pain medications and that the risk of addiction is
low unless the patient had a previous addiction problem.
Not only does the failure to treat chronic pain lead to discomfort, but it’s also
true that when neglected, chronic pain can cause other problems.
296
Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 

Managing Pain with Medications
Taking medications for long periods of time to treat chronic pain is always 
a complex issue, regardless of how old you are. Aging adds other complica-
tions to the mix. Older bodies process drugs differently than younger bodies,
and it often takes smaller dosages to reach an effective pain-killing effect in
older people.
A number of ways to control pain are available in addition to or along with
medicines. You can read about these techniques in many chapters of this
book, but for specific tips, be sure to see the appropriate chapter for your
condition. In addition, Chapter 15 discusses alternative and complementary
approaches to pain control.
Even if certain pain drugs work well for you when you were younger, you
need to be careful about taking the same drug as you age. This caution is 
also important for people who care for (or care about) an elderly person. 
For example, if you’re in your 40s and you’ve had great success in managing
your own arthritic pain with NSAIDs, you may be tempted to give them to
your 80-year-old mother for her arthritis pain. Resist this impulse. Ask your

Possible ageist comments from docs 
and examples of responses
Here are some examples of ageist comments
some doctors make and suggestions on how
you might respond to them.
Ageist comment: You have to expect pain at 
your age! There isn’t much we can do.
Possible response: My pain is severe. Please help.
Ageist comment: Older people have to take a lot
of medicine.
Possible response: I understand that I need a lot
of medicine. But I’m wondering if we could
review all the drugs I take. Maybe I don’t really
need them all.
Ageist comment: I only prescribe narcotics for
short-term pain. Do you want to become a drug
addict?
Possible response: Of course I don’t want to
become a drug addict! But the other medications
we’ve tried don’t help! I’d like to try a low dose of
a strong pain medicine for awhile so that I might
get some relief.
Ageist comment: When you get older, you have
less energy. You’re not 20 any more!
Possible response: I was old two months 
ago and had a lot more energy then. Could there
be some other reason for my sluggishness
now? (Give the doctor an example, such as 
you could take daily walks two months ago, but
can’t now.)

mom to talk to her doctor first, particularly if she has any stomach problems.
Depending on the level of pain that your mother has, the doctor may recom-
mend trying another medicine first. (See Chapter 14 for a 
description of NSAIDs).
Never give away your opiate pain medication to another person. It’s illegal
under federal law and may be very dangerous to the person receiving 
the drug.
The American Geriatrics Society has developed guidelines for fighting off
chronic pain (which they call persistent pain) in older people. The society
convened a panel of experts to make the recommendations. They built 
their guidelines around two important types of drugs:
 Acetaminophen (Tylenol): This drug is the first choice for mild to 
moderate musculoskeletal pain.
 Opiods: Older people with persistent, severe pain require strong drugs,
including opiates such as morphine or oxycodone.
When doctors decide on dosages for acetaminophen, opioids, or other drugs
for older people, they usually “start low and go slow.” In other words, they
use the lowest dose possible and then build slowly until the patient’s pain 
is relieved.
298
Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 
The good and bad about opioids
Opioids, also known as narcotics or opiates,
generally have a greater pain-killing effect in
older people than in younger patients. As a
result, if you’re an older person, you probably
need a lower dose than someone who’s
younger, although the dose should be sufficient
to provide pain relief. (See Chapter 14 for infor-
mation on opioids.) However, geriatricians (doc-
tors who specialize in aging) say that these
drugs are prescribed too infrequently rather
than too often. Undertreatment leads to break-
through pain, which means that the drug isn’t
keeping the pain under control. If your doctor
says that you or your older loved one should
consider taking an opioid, he will work with you
on the type of drug and dosage.
Some opioids, such as propoxyphene (Darvon,
Darvocet), should never be taken by seniors. And
some opiods, such as morphine, can cause 
confusion and even hallucinations in some older
people, so the drug itself should be selected 
with care.
Narcotics have side effects. While opioids are
recommended for severe pain in seniors, almost
every older person who takes them has prob-
lems with constipation, and sometimes with uri-
nation as well. Therefore, older people who take
these drugs regularly should get plenty of exer-
cise, drink lots of fluids, and take laxatives if
needed (under the watchful eye of a physician
who can monitor their heart and sedation levels).

Identifying potential problems
Some health conditions that commonly strike older people can greatly affect
their ability to take their pain medications safely and effectively. The result
can be loss of pain control, as well as dangerous reactions from taking drugs
incorrectly.
The loved ones in your life may not want to talk about these conditions, 
such as vision or hearing loss, because they’re afraid of losing their indepen-
dence. However, if they (or you) have any of the problems listed in this 
section, valuable techniques are available to help you adapt and keep your
independence. In addition, if you’re concerned about a loved one with these
problems, assure him that talking them over with you and your health-care
professionals can help him find techniques and treatments to adjust to the
problems so that he can remain independent.
The following conditions can affect the ability to take pain medications:
 Problems with vision: By the age of 65, about one in three people has a
vision-reducing eye disease. An older person may have difficulty read-
ing, or she may not be able to read prescription labels and consumer
materials about medications. She also may be unable to see the differ-
ences between pills. A resource for adapting to vision problems is The
Vision Learning Center (www.preventblindness.org).
Having a daily pill container filled by another person for the week may
help a person with poor vision. Then the individual can simply take
Monday’s pills on Monday. (However, some pills need to be taken with
food or have other restrictions, so this aid doesn’t work in such cases.)
 Hearing problems: As you grow older, it often becomes more difficult 
to hear soft sounds and conversational speech. In fact, one-third of
adults between the ages of 65 and 74 and about half the people age 85
and older have a hearing loss. As a result, listening to advice from 
doctors and others about prescriptions and treatments for pain control
is difficult or impossible. Many people think that they can read lips 
accurately, but they still miss a great deal of what is said. A resource for
adapting to hearing loss is the American Speech Language Hearing
Association (www.asha.org).
 Cognitive impairment: Some older people have some form of dementia,
and the older the individual, the more likely dementia is present. In fact,
dementia is tragically common among people of advanced age, such as
those over age 85. The Alzheimer’s Association reports that in 2007, 5
million seniors in the United States had Alzheimer’s disease.
(Alzheimer’s is just one form of dementia.)
Studies have shown a correlation between memory problems and not
taking medications according to directions or not taking them at all. The
Alzheimer’s Association (www.alz.org) has local chapters and offers
assistance to people in these situations and their families.
299
Chapter 24: Pain and Aging

 Dexterity: It’s one of the most frustrating things about the aging
process: As you grow older, your physical dexterity declines. This loss of
dexterity can make opening child-proof or even standard packages or
containers difficult or impossible. To help with dexterity issues, ask your
druggist for easy-to-open packaging, pre-filled syringes, and pre-mea-
sured liquid dosages.
Antiaging drugs or techniques are completely experimental at this time and
may have severe negative side effects.
Affecting older bodies differently
As we discuss in Chapter 14, many drugs are available to manage pain.
However, older people are more likely than younger people to experience
side effects from pain-killing drugs because aging increases sensitivity to
most drugs. This is especially true for medications affecting the central 
nervous system. (See Chapter 2 to review how pain works in the central 
nervous system.)
A sad truth of science today is that very few drugs are tested on older
people. Instead, they’re studied in young people — often college students. 
A general understanding of how drugs work in the bodies of older people is
very limited. However, some facts are known.
When you take a medication, your body circulates the drug in its fat and
water. But this process has different results when you’re older. For example,
aging causes a decrease in blood flow in the liver, which is the organ in our
bodies that metabolizes most drugs. This reduced vitality of the liver can
have a substantial effect on the effectiveness and side effects of medications.
In addition, while most drugs are metabolized by the liver, they’re eliminated
by the kidneys. But for people over age 75, kidney function is half what it was
at a younger age. The result is that drugs eliminated by the kidneys hang
around longer in older people.
Sometimes kidney or liver function may change very suddenly without the
older person even being aware of it. If you or a loved one are over age 65 
and you notice side effects, such as confusion or extreme fatigue, contact a
doctor or pharmacist right away.
Guidelines for taking pain medicines
As you and your loved ones age, your bodies change in the way they process
drugs. As a result, you and your doctor understand that effectively managing
your pain medications is one of the most important things you can do for
your health.
300
Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 

Use the medication log in Chapter 17 to keep track of all the drugs you 
take. Keep a copy in your purse or wallet, give a copy to your doctor, and
make sure that your loved ones and caregivers have copies. Here are a few
guidelines if you or a loved one is older and taking medications:
 If possible, use only one pharmacy to fill all your prescription medica-
tions so that your druggist will have an updated chart of all the drugs
you take. She can also check for possible incompatibilities between the
drugs you take.
 If you take two or more drugs, ask your doctor and pharmacist to run
your medication list through a drug interactions database. (Four eyes
are better than two!) You can also check for drug interactions yourself 
at www.drugs.com. (Click Interactions Checker.)
Deciphering Pain in Seniors 
with Memory Problems
Dementia is a tragic condition of declining mental abilities. If a loved one 
has a diagnosis of dementia, it means she may have difficulty reasoning and
remembering. In fact, your loved one may not even fully understand physical
problems, such as pain.
Older people with dementia may have many medical problems that can make
diagnosis difficult. If you have a loved one with dementia, try to determine
whether he’s experiencing pain.
If you see any clues that pain is present in a senior with dementia, talk to 
a doctor or other health-care professional right away. Using the list of 
nonverbal cues that we include in Chapter 17, try to fill in the blanks, giving
as much detail as possible. Here are some observations important for the
older person’s doctor or other health-care provider to know:
 Offer your best guess as to how you think the pain is experienced by 
the senior (for example, burning, aching, stabbing). Also, explain what
you’ve observed that led you to these guesses.
 Describe when you observe the pain occurring, such as when the senior
is getting up from a chair or lying in bed.
 Provide a history of all prescription and over-the-counter medicines
your loved one takes. (Use the log in Chapter 17.)
 Give examples of displays of pain you’ve noticed, such as grunting or
clutching a hip.
 Report on what — if anything — appears to relieve the pain.

 Discovering the total pain concept

 Coping with terminal pain
 Knowing your rights as a patient
T
his chapter is hard-hitting, and it’s one that many people would prefer not
to read. But if you or someone you love has chronic pain and a terminal
illness, this chapter is important because it covers the difficult situation of
having chronic pain that is amplified by end-of-life pain.
Pain associated with the dying process may or may not be related to the 
pain of an individual’s chronic condition. For example, Nora struggled for a
decade with fibromyalgia, and she now has a rare condition called primary
pulmonary hypertension. It affects the blood vessels in her lungs and makes
breathing difficult. Nora is faced with managing both her fibromyalgia pain
and the pain from the primary pulmonary hypertension.
In order to manage her condition and the resulting pain, Nora has taken
advantage of a concept called palliative care, which uses a team of doctors
and other types of professionals (such as palliative-care social workers 
and chaplains) who meet regularly to plan and coordinate their patient’s
interdisciplinary care.
This chapter covers the palliative care approach and offers information
about total pain, an idea particularly relevant for people with chronic pain
who also have a terminal illness.

Managing Total Pain with 
the Palliative Approach
The concept of total pain dates back to Cicely Saunders, the founder of the
first hospice in the United States. She opened St. Christopher’s Hospice in
1967, with the wise perception that chronic pain in the face of death presents
challenges to the patient, doctor, and other members of the health-care team.
Saunders saw such pain as endless and meaningless, bringing a sense of 
isolation and despair to the patient. She described the concept of total pain
as the suffering that encompasses a person’s physical, psychological, social,
spiritual, and practical struggles.
Saunders and her colleagues saw that people with constant pain experienced
a worsening of chronic pain when they were diagnosed with a terminal illness,
largely because of the many stressors associated with a fatal disease. Here 
are some examples of the types of distress that contribute to total pain:
 Psychological pain: Difficulty coping with a diagnosis and adapting 
to physical changes, such as the loss of hair or a limb.
 Social pain: Sorrow over the idea of leaving family and friends and 
the loss of a career and/or parenting.
 Spiritual pain: Questioning whether an afterlife really exists; anger 
at God.
 Practical: Organizing necessary care and finances as the illness 
progresses.
The palliative approach to managing total pain includes a team of experts
who help you cope with sources of distress. For example, a grief counselor
can help both you and your family cope with the distress of possible separa-
tion. A chaplain or other spiritual advisor can help you work through spiri-
tual issues. And an estate attorney and/or financial advisor can help you put
your financial affairs in order.
Palliative care focuses on the relief of the pain and the symptoms and 
stress of a serious illness. The goal of this type of care is to give comfort 
and support to the person receiving care. It’s not an alternative to conven-
tional medical care, but complements it. It is also not the same thing as 
“comfort measures only.” It’s a coordinated effort to give the best possible
comprehensive care under the circumstances. Palliative and hospice care
were recognized as a medical subspecialty in 2006 by the American Board 
of Medical Specialties.
Palliative care is not a one-size-fits-all treatment. The palliative care 
team devises and carries out treatment to meet the particular needs of 
each patient.
304
Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 

You or your loved one can receive palliative care in your own home, in a
nursing facility, hospital, or other setting of your choice.
Palliative care is often confused with hospice care, but they differ. Specifically,
hospice care involves helping ill individuals and their families during the last
days or months of life and is often an important part of palliative care, which
can involve caring for the individual over a longer period of time and is 
compatible with treatment that aims to cure the terminal illness.
One of the many advantages of palliative care is that it’s patient-centered. If
you’re the patient receiving palliative care, you’ll be the central force of your
team. The team is all about you!
You also have a responsibility to be as informed as possible about your con-
dition, your needs, and the desires you have for the future. For example, is it
important that you never, ever go to a nursing home, even if a very good one
is nearby? Is it important to you to never have invasive medical procedures?
If so, it’s up to you to make these wishes known to your family members, 
doctors, other members of your team, and particularly anyone who you
choose as a health-care agent (a person you predesignate to make medical
decisions for you if you can’t make them).
Facing the Hard, Physical 
Truth about Dying
In addition to severe pain, people who are dying can suffer additional
unpleasant and uncomfortable symptoms that impede quality of life. Yet
many people at the end of life want to spend their precious remaining time
with loved ones. Or, they may have some unfinished business to work out
with family and friends. They may also want to set their financial affairs in
order. When physical problems get in the way of such meaningful and signifi-
cant activities, patients feel even more frustrated on top of the already- diffi-
cult circumstances.
Common physical problems that occur during the dying process are nausea,
lack of appetite, difficulty breathing, weakness, fatigue, and problems with
elimination. In addition, the fear of intolerable pain can cause great anxiety
and irritability, and some studies have shown that the fear of future pain is a
major source of stress. You can treat most of these problems, and your team
can work to put these treatments in motion for you. For example, for fatigue,
your team can focus on finding and treating possible causes, such as anemia
and depression. For loss of appetite, your doctor can prescribe a variety of
measures, such as the drug megestrol, a synthetic version of the hormone
progesterone. It increases weight gain by increasing appetite for women with
certain types of cancer.
305
Chapter 25: Pain at the End of Life

Managing the pain of a terminal illness
As death draws near, the standard of treatment for pain control is the use of
opioids, sometimes along with other analgesics. (See Chapter 14 for informa-
tion on these drugs.) In addition to managing pain, opioids can help with anx-
iety and breathlessness, common problems at the end of life. If the individual
can’t take medication by mouth, drugs can be delivered in the cheek or under
the tongue (sublingually). In addition, skin patches or rectal suppositories 
are sometimes easier for patients to use at home. Other options, such as
intravenous medication, can cause more discomfort for the individual and
usually can’t be done at home.
There is good news, however. Some newer delivery systems for drugs are
now available, which can provide pain relief at the end of life with little or 
no drowsiness or hallucinations. (These procedures are mouthfuls and are
called tunneled epidural catheters with continuous external infusion pumps
and implanted internal intrathecal infusion pumps.) In addition, in some
cases painful nerves can now be removed.
A major tradeoff with taking opioids is that, at the levels necessary to control
severe pain, they can cause drowsiness, hallucinations, and other unpleasant
symptoms.
End of life is a time when your wishes (or the wishes of your loved one) are
extremely important, and you have hopefully conveyed them to the person
who’ll act in your behalf if you can’t speak for yourself. The question to
answer and convey to your health-care agent is whether you would rather
have the pain than the side effects of the drug.
Lamenting loss of control
If your loved one has chronic pain and is approaching the end of life, loss 
of control is likely to be one of his most frustrating concerns. As a terminal 
illness advances and pain takes over, the individual loses more and more 
control. For most, this loss of control is a dreaded aspect of the end of life. In
fact, many people fear the loss of independence more than death itself.
For example, you may need help with all your private needs, such as toilet-
ing, or you may need to be fed by hand. Many people become depressed 
and grouchy at this point. It’s important for the patient to retain any kind of
control still possible. If you’re caring for someone in this situation, try to find
things that he can still control. For example, let him decide what food to eat
and what time of day to eat it, or give him a choice of TV shows to watch. Or
arrange for him to administer his own dosages of painkiller when he wants 
it through PCA. (See Chapter 14 for information on PCAs.) These decisions
may seem like little things to you, but they can help raise the spirits of the
person who is dying.
306
Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 

Looking at Hospice Care
Most people want to stay home until they die, and, most of all, they don’t
want to be in a hospital or nursing home. However, sometimes there’s no
choice because the individual needs care — such as being hooked up to a
heart monitor or infusion equipment — that can’t be provided at home.
Understanding what hospice care is
Many people with terminal illnesses choose hospice care. In fact, the National
Hospice and Palliative Care Organization estimates that approximately 36
percent of all deaths in the United States are under the care of a hospice 
program. Patients make this choice at the point when a cure is no longer 
possible for their condition. Hospice care provides palliative care along with
other services to make the dying process as comfortable as possible. This
type of care stresses peace, comfort, and dignity for the patient.
Hospice care recognizes death as the final stage of life, and the typical hos-
pice patient has a life expectancy of only a couple of months. The care may
be provided at home or at a facility specifically planned and organized to
care for people at the end of life.
Most hospice programs require a doctor to verify that a patient’s probability
of survival is less than six months, a requirement for eligibility to receive
Medicare or other insurance coverage.
You have two options when it comes to hospice care:

make this possible, such as medications, ventilators, walkers, and other
durable medical equipment. In addition, nursing visits, home health-care
visits, volunteer support, chaplain services, social workers, and so on
allow the patient to receive care at home. A lot of the time, the family
provides most of the care to the individual.
 Hospice care in a hospital, nursing home, or other facility: Some
people with terminal illnesses require more care than can be provided at
home. When this is the case, inpatient hospices in acute-care hospitals,
chronic care hospitals, or nursing homes are an option. These programs
try to provide a home-like setting.
Locating a reputable hospice service
Hospice care providers can vary a great deal. Some are based in home-like
buildings, some are part of hospitals, and others provide only home-health
care. They may be run by religious organizations, for-profit companies, 
or not-for-profits. Or, they may serve only people with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer care, or another area. So how do you 
find the best program in your geographic area? Here are some tips to help
guide you:

Part V: Understanding Pain Throughout the Life Cycle 
Types of care often needed at the end of life
The types of care needed to control total pain
often include the following services. In addition,
in most geographic areas, hospice-care pro-
grams provide or coordinate many of these 
services:
 Physician services, including pain manage-
ment and other comfort care
 Nursing care
 Physical therapists
 Home medical equipment, such as hospital
beds and oxygen
 Grief and related counseling for yourself
and your loved ones
 Spiritual support
 Social services and support
 Personal care, such as assistance with
bathing and toileting
 Assistance with errands, meals, house-
cleaning, and other domestic tasks
 Respite care, which fills in for caregivers so
that they can take breaks

 Visit the Hospice and Palliative Care searchable database at http://
caringinfo.org. Click Caring for Someone and then Find a Local
Hospice to locate hospice providers nationwide.
 Ask for opinions from people who’ve had personal experience with 
specific hospices. Ask your friends, your doctor, the discharge planner
at your local hospital (she’ll know all the services in your area), and
social workers from local agencies.
 Find out whether the hospice is certified. Medicare requires certification
for payment eligibility, and in some states, so does Medicaid. State
health departments certify hospices.
 Find out whether it’s licensed. Licensing is also usually handled by your
state health department.
 Find out whether its employees are bonded. If so, you have some 
protection against any potential legal problems.
Understanding Your Rights
By bioethical standards, as patients, you or a loved one have the right to
choose your treatment as long as you’re competent. But what if you’re not
competent — in other words, you’re not capable of making a decision in your
own best interests, and this fact has been established legally in court by a 
relative, guardian, or other interested party. In this case, a health-care agent
substitutes for you to say what you would say if you could make the decision
yourself. So, it is important to pick someone for this position whom you trust
to respect your wishes. See the contact information for the National Hospice
and Pallative Care Organization in the next section for information about
picking a health care agent.
Understand that the health-care agent is not making the decision for you. 
She will tell others what you would value if you could make the decision. So,
it is key that you let anyone who you arrange to stand in for you know exactly
what your wishes are.
Following are examples of the types of questions you should discuss with
your health-care agent:
 Would you want to be kept alive at all costs, even if it meant that you
would have pain even more severe than the pain you have now?
 Do you want to receive ventilation if needed?
 Is it okay to perform surgery if necessary?

Chapter 26
Ten Ways to Detect Bogus “Cures”
In This Chapter
 Staying away from bogus arthritis and cancer remedies
 Shunning false anti-aging promises
H
ave you seen ads that offer intriguing promises like “Natural Secret
Cures They Want to Hide from You” or “The One Cure for All Diseases”?
If so, hopefully you tuned them out. Or perhaps you bought one of these
products, thinking, “Maybe it’ll work,” and you were disappointed. Bogus
remedies for chronic pain often make major money for sellers because so
many people are eager for relief. But these products often have serious con-
sequences for the purchaser. They waste precious dollars that could have
been spent on legitimate medical treatments. They may prevent people from
getting the medical treatment they really need. And these so-called remedies
may even be harmful to your health.
So why do so many people fall for these sales pitches? For one thing, distribu-
tors are not just selling a product. Instead, they’re primarily selling hope to
people with serious diseases and chronic pain. Who wouldn’t want to take
the XYZ potion and obliterate all their pain and the disease itself, forever?
Sounds great! But hold on! You’re being scammed.
Quack cures for chronic pain and the diseases that cause them come in the
form of drugs (pills, lotions, or other forms) and nutritional supplements
(including some that you can buy at health-food stores). Miracle cures may
be touted on “infotainment programs” on radio and television. Sometimes
they’re promoted by direct mail. However, the fastest growing sales medium
for these products is the Internet. Information on fake cures is also published
in books available for purchase on Amazon.com and other Internet sites.

Because ads for bogus cures are everywhere, you can’t steer entirely clear of
them. And sometimes it’s tough to figure out when a remedy may be legiti-
mate. In this chapter, we provide you ten important points to help you identify
and avoid bogus cures. Hopefully, they’ll prevent you from being victimized.
Many bogus cures use the placebo effect, in which drugs with no active ingre-
dients seem to be effective, to make victims (you, your family, your friends)
feel that they’re getting better, when the truth is that many people feel better
just because they’re taking a pill or potion —regardless of what is in it. The
fact is that this type of relief does not last.
Avoid Products Promising to Halt Aging
Remedies that claim to stop aging play on fears of growing old as well as 
the worry that current pain problems may worsen with aging You may think,
“I hurt now, but what about in five years? How will I be able to stand it?
Maybe taking an anti-aging miracle cure now is just the ticket.” Sorry, but 
no, it’s not!
“Anti-aging” medicine is a multibillion dollar industry in the United States
today, so a lot of people are buying into staving off aging. However, no treat-
ments have proven to slow the aging process. Consequently, no treatments
can stop chronic pain by slowing down aging.
Here’s a checklist from the World Health Organization of anti-aging potions 
to avoid:
 Injections of human growth hormone (HGH): Some dietary supple-
ments are known as HGH-releasers, which purportedly stimulate the
body’s production of the hormone. HGH-releasers, which can cost
$15,000 a year, are marketed as a cheaper alternative to shots. But no
valid evidence supports that any type of HGH supplementation offers
life-extension benefits.
 DHEA: DHEA breaks down into estrogen and testosterone in the body.
Found in anti-aging dietary supplements that supposedly improve libido,
strength, energy, muscles, and immunity to disease, DHEA also suppos-
edly decreases fat. What a wonder drug! Feeling strong, energetic, mus-
cular, sexy, healthy, younger, and thinner sounds pretty great. Too bad it
isn’t for real. No evidence supports DHEA as an anti-aging hormone.
 Melatonin: Often included in anti-aging supplements, melatonin may
help you get to sleep if you have insomnia, but it won’t slow down the
aging process.
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Stay Away from Products Promising 
to Cure Arthritis Overnight
Unproven arthritis remedies are easy to fall for because many symptoms
come and go. Maybe today was a good day, and you attribute it to the 
anti-arthritis supplement that you took yesterday (or the copper bracelet 
you wore), when the truth is that it was really just a good arthritis day.
Maybe the weather was nice, and your arthritis calmed down. Or something
else helped you feel better. But your good arthritis day had nothing to do
with the pill or the bracelet.
At present, no cures exist for any of the 100-plus forms of arthritis. We 
really, really wish there were. The authors of this book are a rheumatologist
who treats many people in severe pain (Dr. Kassan), a pain researcher and
avid golfer with arthritis in his wrists (Dr. Vierck), and a medical writer with
arthritis throughout her body (Elizabeth Vierck). We’d love for those phony
ads to be true! But they’re just not.
Shun Amazing Cancer Cures
Quacks prey on people’s fear of cancer. Their ads say things like “This 
Cancer Cure Really Works.” They claim all you have to do is take their pills 
or potions or follow a special (and often very complicated) diet, and you’ll be
free of cancer and the pain that goes with it. Or they push special facilities,
making such statements as “Visit our clinic in Mexico, and in two weeks you’ll
be cancer free.”
When these cure-alls fail for desperate consumers, the hucksters then claim
it was because of damage done by previous “conventional” therapy. Or it’s
that the consumer didn’t follow their regimen to the letter. In other words,
you did it wrong, and it’s your fault that it didn’t work. Don’t believe any of
this rubbish!
Laetrile is a famous example of a bogus cancer cure. Not only has it been
found to not cure cancer, but it’s also poisonous in high dosages. The sad
truth is that by using unproven methods such as laetrile, people with cancer
may lose valuable time when they could be receiving effective treatment and
often ridding themselves of cancer.
315
Chapter 26: Ten Ways to Detect Bogus “Cures”

Suspect Common Sales Tactics
Health quacks often use similar techniques proven to sell their bogus 
products. Stay away from products with the following claims:
 Our product cures everything. The distributor may claim that the 
product cures arthritis, cancer, stomach ulcers, and depression. About 
a hundred years ago, people bought potions that purported to cure
everything, like Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup (containing morphine),
because there were few reliable drugs available at the time and almost
no government oversight. Those cure-all potions were dangerous. They
didn’t cure disease then, and the current crop of “amazing” drugs still
doesn’t work now. Stick with mainstream medicine.
 The product cures diseases not yet understood by medical science,
such as fibromyalgia and other forms of arthritis. The reality is 
that these medical problems have no known cures. Yet medically 
documented treatments really help. These treatments, discussed
throughout this book, are the ones you should be using.
 Promoters say they’re valiant souls persecuted by evil people who
want to prevent them from telling you the truth. They may claim 
that universities or pharmaceutical companies seek to suppress their
treatment out of professional jealousy or fear of losing profits. These
promoters don’t have credible scientists and medical professionals to
back them up, so they invent conspiracy theories instead. Don’t believe
them. There are some bad guys out there, and they’re the promoters of
fake remedies.
 Sales people give testimonials and no scientific proof. When no studies
support the use of a product, scam artists often revert to the use of 
testimonials that can’t be verified for accuracy or effect. Usually, these
testimonials are nothing more than an infomercial and don’t give any
useful scientific information. Typically, the claims range from vague
descriptions of feeling better to miraculous transformations.
Be Aware of Safety Concerns 
of Supplements
Dietary supplements are regulated very little by the government compared to
the scrutiny given to over-the-counter or prescribed medications, yet taking
supplements can be akin to taking drugs — or worse.
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Once in your system, many supplements interact with other medications 
and supplements and may cause serious harm. For example, the popular 
supplement St. John’s Wort can be dangerous when taken with a number 
of commonly prescribed drugs. According to the National Center on
Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes 
of Health, some drugs that St. John’s Wort may interact with include
 Birth control pills: St. John’s Wort may cause breakthrough bleeding.
 Antidepressants: When combined with some antidepressants, St. John’s
wort may increase nausea, anxiety, headache, and confusion.
 Warfarin and related anti-clotting drugs (anticoagulants): When 
combined with St. John’s Wort, warfarin is less effective.
To ensure the safe use of any health-care product, read labels and package
inserts, follow product directions, and check with your physician about 
substances you’re considering taking. In addition, make sure that no warn-
ings have been issued about the product. The following Web sites list 
supplements that are questionable or have been found to have adverse
effects. Check these sites out before you buy!
 Federal Trade Commission: www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/
health/drugs.shtm
 Food and Drug Administration: www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/
supplmnt.html
 Arthritis Foundation: www.arthritis.org/conditions/
supplementguide
Check Out Health Claims 
Before Sampling
To check a product out, follow these tips:
 If it’s an unproven or little-known treatment, always ask a doctor, 
pharmacist, or other medical specialist if the product is safe.
 Talk to others. Be wary of treatments offered by people telling you to
avoid talking to others because “It’s a secret treatment or cure.”
 Check with the Better Business Bureau or local attorneys generals’
offices to see whether other consumers have lodged complaints about
the product or the product’s marketer.
317
Chapter 26: Ten Ways to Detect Bogus “Cures”

 Contact appropriate health professional groups, such as the American
Cancer Society and the Arthritis Foundation. Many groups have local
chapters that provide various resource materials about your disease.
 Check with the FDA. It’s part of the FDA’s job to see that medicines 
and medical devices are safe and effective. For more information, call
toll-free, 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332), or visit www.fda.gov.
Avoid Impulse Buying!
Never decide “on the spot” to try an untested product or treatment. Ask for
more information and then consult a knowledgeable doctor, pharmacist, or
other health-care professional. Promoters of legitimate health-care products
don’t object to your seeking additional information.
To learn whether the FDA or the FTC has taken action against the promoter
of a product, visit www.fda.gov/oc/enforcement.html or www.ftc.gov.
You can also check out www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/ds-warn.html for a
list of dietary supplement ingredients for which the FDA has issued warnings.
Be Wary of “Cures” Sold on the Web
It’s easy to run into ads for unproven remedies when surfing on the Web. 
We recently did an Internet search using the keyword “chronic pain,” which
turned up a front-page ad for a supplement that claimed to take away pain,
elevate your mood, and cut your food cravings. Hey, sounds great! But such
claims are unsubstantiated.
When searching on the Web, try using directory sites of respected organiza-
tions, rather than doing blind searches with a search engine. Also ask 
yourself the following questions:
 Who sponsors the site? Is the site run by the government, a university,
or a reputable medical or health-related association? Is the information
written or reviewed by experts in the field, academia, the government,
or the medical community? If not, then claims provided on this site 
are suspect.
 What is the purpose of the site? Is the purpose of the site to educate
the public objectively or just to sell a product? The intent may be hard
to determine sometimes, but see how many places the Web page has
where you can click to buy the product. The more places and the easier
it is to purchase something, the less likely the site is objective.
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 What is the source of the information, and does it have any refer-
ences? Have any studies supporting the “cure” been reviewed by 
recognized scientific experts and published in reputable peer-reviewed
scientific journals, such as The New England Journal of Medicine? Can
you find the study in the National Library of Medicine’s database of 
literature citations at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed? If you can’t
find any legitimate studies, stay away from this so-called cure.
 How reliable are Internet or e-mail solicitations? While the Internet
can be a rich source of reliable health information, it’s also an easy vehi-
cle for spreading myths, hoaxes, and rumors about alleged news, stud-
ies, products, or findings. To avoid falling for such hoaxes, be skeptical
and watch out for overly emphatic language with ALL UPPERCASE 
LETTERS and lots of exclamation points!!!! Also, beware of such phrases,
such as “This is not a hoax” or “Send this to everyone you know.” Don’t
do it! Instead, move on.
Watch Out for Celebrity Promotions
Tommy Terrific, the famous hockey star, and Sandy Glamorous of television
fame are promoting a brand new product that they swear will eradicate 
your pain. They emphatically repeat on TV that this product is an absolute
must for you! It’ll ease your chronic pain, and you won’t have to take danger-
ous drugs like narcotics. Instead, call right now and order their amazing 
just-discovered cure from the jungles of Peru. You reach for the phone
because you’re confident that Tommy or Sandy wouldn’t lie to you. They’re
so sincere! Well, maybe they aren’t lying — sometimes celebrities actually
believe in the product. That still doesn’t make it okay for you. Ask your
doctor first.
Always Report If Anything Goes Wrong!
If you have a negative reaction to any unproven remedy, be sure to report 
it to the federal government. Your action could prevent other people from
having the same bad reaction. So be a good guy and help others. Call 
the Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088. You can also fax the
FDA at 1-800-FDA-0178 or report online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/
how.htm.

Ten Things to Remember about
Pain and Sexuality
In This Chapter
 Addressing your fears
 Checking your medications
 Talking to your partner
M
aybe you’re starting to feel some of that special spark once again, and
your partner is hinting about some action, too. But darn it, you’re just
in too much pain for sex right now. Or maybe you are the one desiring inti-
macy, but you’re worried that your partner is in too much pain, and you’re
afraid to initiate anything sexual. So you hold off.
Chronic pain, and some of the medications that treat it, can curb sexual
enjoyment for both you and your partner. But sexual intimacy is an important
part of a healthy relationship and quality of life for the individuals involved.
So don’t give up on sex! Read this chapter for helpful hints on re-igniting your
relationship despite your pain problem.
In this chapter, you find ten things to keep in mind in order to ignite a healthy
and pleasing sex life.
Address Your Fears
If you have chronic pain, you may have some fears about sexual relations.
You’re not alone. Many people with chronic pain develop these issues. Here
are three top concerns and what you can do about them:

 Fear of rejection: It’s common to worry that chronic pain makes you
less sexy. For example, maybe you’re less active now during sex than
before your pain condition struck. You may think that your partner will
be “bored” with the lower level of activity that you need in order to
avoid pain. If so, talk about this fear together. Focus on new and creative
ways that don’t hurt so that you can enjoy sex together.
 Fear of pain: You don’t want to hurt, and your partner doesn’t want to
hurt you either. (Yelling “ouch” during a heated moment can be a major
letdown for both of you.) Make sure that you’ve taken your pain medica-
tion before launching any sexual activity. Regular exercise and relaxation
exercises may also help reduce your anxiety about pain. In addition,
many people find that it also helps to try different ways to satisfy their
partner. Try experimenting with sexual positions that can cause less
pain. Also, don’t forget lubricants!
 Fear of failure: If you’re having trouble becoming aroused or achieving
an orgasm, consult your doctor. Several medications that may help 
are available for men and women that your physician can prescribe.
Figure Out What to Do about 
Specific Problems
Chronic pain can cause problems that ultimately affect your sexuality, such
as a lack of sleep, stiffness, and difficulty moving around.
Make a list of problems that may affect your desire and ability for sex and
then strategize on what to do about them. Strategize with your partner, if you
have one. (More about that in the upcoming “Talk to Your Partner” section.)
A great resource for identifying problems that may be hampering your desire
for sex is the Sexual Health page on MedlinePlus at http://medline
plus.gov.
Check Your Medications
Make sure that none of the drugs you’re taking are causing sexual problems.
For example, narcotics frequently lower the hormone testosterone’s levels to
the point that the following side effects exist: lack of interest in sex, inability
to achieve erection or orgasm, clinical depression, and a general lack of
energy. (These side effects are often alarming to the male chronic pain
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

patient, and if you or your partner feel this way, it’s important to mention
them to your doctor. A simple blood test may demonstrate low testosterone
levels that can be treated effectively with a testosterone patch, skin gel, or
injections.)
Other medicines can also cause arousal problems, including the following:
 Some pain medications
 Blood pressure medicines
 Antihistamines
 Antidepressants
 Tranquilizers
 Appetite suppressants
 Diabetes drugs
 Some ulcer drugs, such as ranitidine
Some of these drugs may lead to impotence or make it hard for men to 
ejaculate, while others can reduce a woman’s sexual desire.
If you’re taking any of these categories of drugs and experiencing sexual
problems, consider asking your doctor to prescribe a different drug without
this side effect or to lower your dosage.
Pay Attention to Your Emotions
How you feel may affect what you’re able to do sexually. Are you depressed
because of chronic pain? Are you angry? Frustrated? Do you have a “Why
me?” attitude toward your pain? All these emotions and attitudes can affect
your sexuality.
Living with chronic pain often requires making adjustments to daily life.
Many people find it useful to talk these issues out with a good therapist.
Don’t blame yourself for sexual difficulties you and your partner are having. 
It takes two to have fun with sex, and it also takes two to fix it when it isn’t
fun anymore.
Rest can greatly help your emotional state. Take a nap before having sex so
that you won’t wear out when you least want to.
323
Chapter 27: Ten Things to Remember about Pain and Sexuality

Talk to Your Partner
Sex can be difficult to talk about, even with someone you’ve been intimate
with for a long time. Counselors suggest that you talk about sex when you’re
fully clothed and in a neutral setting. Of course, you should probably avoid
having this discussion in a crowded public place. People nearby may find
your discussion far too fascinating not to eavesdrop!
This discussion is the time for both of you to talk about your fears and
desires. During your conversation about sex, begin sentences with “I,” not
“you.” For example, saying “I feel loved and cared about when you hold 
me close” is much better than “You never touch me anymore!”
You may think that your partner has stopped touching you because of a lack
of interest, or that you’re no longer desirable. Instead, your partner’s main
concern may be fear of causing you more physical pain. Only when you talk 
it out can you find out what’s going on with each other.
Let Go of Stereotypes about Sex
Many people have stereotypical ideas about sex, and these ideas can impede
their sexual happiness. Here’s the thing: The only rules about sex that 
everyone should follow are
 No one should get hurt, physically or emotionally.
 Sexual activity should be between consenting adults.
Another common and mistaken assumption is that sex should always be
spontaneous. But spontaneity can be difficult when you have chronic pain.
It’s okay (really!) to plan your sexual activities together, whether it’s best for
you on Friday night after dinner when your pain is often at its lowest level 
or during an “afternoon delight” when you’re both home.
Lots of people also think that certain things must happen during sex. For
example, they think that it isn’t real sex if no orgasm occurs. But that isn’t
true either. You can have intimate times together in many ways that are 
not mind-blowingly sexual, but that still feel great and make you and your
partner happy.
Try new ideas and new positions that may be more amenable to a body in
pain. For example, maybe the missionary position hurts you, so try having
sex side-to-side or in another position. Be creative.
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Get Help from the Experts
Sexuality experts can assist with sexual problems that result from chronic
pain and also help you come up with ideas for sexual enjoyment. Obviously,
you’ll want a therapist sensitive to you and your partner’s needs, so check
out the resources listed in the “Educate Yourself about Sex” section, later in
this chapter.
In addition, Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania (www.widener.
edu), and Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York (www.hofstra.edu),
both have graduate programs in sex therapy. You may want to check with
them to locate therapists who graduated from their programs.
Make Dates If You Sleep Separately
Chronic pain may mean that you and your partner sleep in separate beds or
even in different rooms. The lack of proximity can create distance in your
lovemaking activities, particularly if you’re both on different schedules. But
separate sleeping spaces don’t mean that you can’t get together often.
Make dates to meet in a comfortable place in the house when you know 
you’ll be well-rested. Visit each other often in each other’s bed, even if you’re
just relaxing and not doing anything sexual. These rendezvous will benefit
your sex life if you make a habit of being close to each other often, even if
you sleep separately.
Become Physically Fit and 
Work at Being Attractive
Keep a positive attitude about yourself. Being a positive person is attractive
to others, while being too negative is a turnoff.
Also, looking attractive can help create a sexual spark — for you, because
you feel good about yourself, and for your partner, because you look great.
Sometimes people with chronic pain don’t have the energy and strength to
keep up their appearance. But making a special effort can pay off. It’s easy 
to gain weight and get out of shape due to inactivity (especially when you 
feel that it hurts too much to exercise). But maintaining a healthy weight 
can greatly improve your appearance and desirability. Check out Chapters 18
and 19 to find out more about nutrition and exercise for people with 
chronic pain.

Ten or So Web Sources for 
People with Chronic Pain
In This Chapter
 Finding support groups
 Locating pain doctors and medical pain centers
M
any free resources are available on the Web for people with chronic
pain. This chapter describes organizational Web sites that can help
you find out more about chronic pain. This information is organized into 
categories so that you can easily locate the help you need.
Keep in mind two important warnings on health information that’s available
on the Web:
 Although many reliable resources are on the Internet, including those 
we list in this chapter, sadly, far too many sites offer only incorrect and/
or outdated information, and many are downright hoaxes designed to
sell empty promises. Make sure that you gather information only from
reliable resources. Two good sites for checking out possible hoaxes are
www.quackwatch.org and http://hoaxbusters.ciac.org.
 Don’t forget that the information you obtain from any Web site is no 
substitute for a checkup and advice from an appropriate medical 
professional. If you have chronic pain and haven’t told your doctor
about it or found a doctor who can help you, please do it now.
Finding Information
Several helpful organizations offer you general information on chronic pain
and the health conditions that cause it:

The American Pain Foundation (APF); phone 1-888-615-PAIN (7246); Web 
site www.painfoundation.org. The foundation’s comprehensive Pain
Information Library includes information on a broad array of topics of inter-
est to people with ongoing pain, such as what kind of work you can continue
to do if you qualify for Social Security disability payments, as well as back-
ground information on many diseases that cause chronic pain. The Web site
also provides information on pain relief studies and therapies.
Danemiller Foundation; Web site www.pain.com. This Web site hosts not
only substantial information for patients but also has a forum in which
experts in pain medicine are available to answer questions posed to them.
The Mayo Clinic; Web site www.mayoclinic.com. The Mayo Clinic is a 
reliable and comprehensive source of a wide range of health information. 
You can look up diseases and conditions alphabetically and find background
information and updates on research.
MedlinePlus; Web site http://medlineplus.gov. MedlinePlus brings
together authoritative information from the National Library of Medicine, NIH,
and other government agencies and health-related organizations. The Web 
site includes preformulated searches, which provide you with easy access to
abstracts (summaries) of many medical journal articles. MedlinePlus also 
has extensive information about drugs, an illustrated medical encyclopedia,
interactive patient tutorials, and the latest health news. This site is a great
resource! Use it.
Finding Support Groups
Many people find valuable information, as well as understanding, by joining
support groups whose members share their condition. Often, such groups
are available locally, and their meeting times are listed in your local newspa-
per. If you can’t find the information you need, call the reference librarian at
your local library.
American Chronic Pain Association (ACPA); phone 1-800-533-3231; Web site
www.theacpa.org. In 1980, after years of living with chronic pain, Penney
Cowan placed a notice in her church bulletin, and she quickly found others
living with chronic pain. As a result of Cowan’s work, the first ACPA support
group was born. Several hundred ACPA support groups now meet across the
United States and Canada, as well as other countries. ACPA’s Web site has 
a searchable database that enables you to find support groups in your area.
You can then call its toll-free number for contact information or e-mail the
organization at ACPA@pacbell.net.

Finding Doctors Who Specialize 
in Pain Management
When you have chronic pain, you need a caring and knowledgeable doctor.
Maybe you already have one, and if so, she’s a keeper! But if you need to
locate a new doctor, consider online resources as one means for locating
and/or screening the best physician for you.
American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM); Web site www.aapain
manage.org. AAPM provides credentialing to physicians, accreditation 
of pain centers, and other resources for medical professionals who treat
people in pain. The academy has more than 6,000 members. Its Web site 
has a searchable database where you can find pain professionals and/or 
pain centers located near you.
American Board of Pain Medicine (ABPM); Web site http://www.abpm.
org. The ABPM tests and certifies physicians in the field of pain medicine. 
Its Web site offers a searchable database of its qualified members (called
diplomates). You can search for diplomates in your area and by specialty,
such as anesthesiology or rheumatology.
International Spine Intervention Society; Web site www.spinalinjection.
com. A physician organization in pain medicine dedicated to implementing
guidelines for physicians practicing interventional pain.
Locating Medical Centers Specializing 
in Pain Management
Some medical centers concentrate on treating chronic pain only, and their
services may be just what you need to get on the path to feeling better.
The American Pain Society; Web site www.ampainsoc.org. The society
has a searchable database of pain treatment centers, which you can 
identify by location, services, classification, and setting (such as home or
hospital-based).
Resources Outside the United States
Maybe the information you need isn’t readily available in the United States,
but you can access it online at a site in another country, such as Canada 
or England.
329
Chapter 28: Ten or So Web Sources for People with Chronic Pain

The Canadian Pain Society; Web site www.canadianpainsociety.ca. 
The Canadian Pain Society provides a bilingual Web site (English and French)
offering free journal articles and a newsletter pertaining to pain and pain 
control, as well as links to Canadian resources.
The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP); Web site
www.iasp-pain.org. IASP’s members include scientists, physicians, psy-
chologists, dentists, nurses, and physical therapists dedicated to furthering
research on, and improving the care of, patients with pain. The association’s
Web site provides free medical newsletters and clinical updates and resource
listings by country.
Advocacy
You may be looking for an organization whose leadership and members
understand the tough fight you and others must face to obtain relief from
your chronic pain and who have some ability to get things done within local,
state, and federal governments. If so, advocacy may be the answer for you.
Consider the following Web sites.
Partners Against Pain; Web site www.partnersagainstpain.com. This
alliance of patients, caregivers, and health-care providers works to advance
standards of pain care through education and advocacy.
The American Pain Society; Web site www.ampainsoc.org. This go-to 
organization covers what’s happening in the area of advocacy about chronic
pain issues. The society has a three-part agenda guiding its national advo-
cacy efforts. It focuses on enhancing funding from the National Institutes of
Health for pain research, removing barriers to effective clinical pain manage-
ment, and providing evidence and analysis to further the understanding of
controversies surrounding opioid use and abuse.

Chapter 29
Ten Things to Avoid When 
You Have Chronic Pain
In This Chapter
 Knowing what not to do when you have chronic pain
 Discovering your rights as a health-care consumer
M
ost of this book tells you what you should do to better deal with 
your chronic pain. This chapter takes an entirely different approach,
advising you about what not to do when you have chronic pain.
Don’t Stop Caring for the Condition
Causing Your Pain
Whether you have diabetes, arthritis, or one of the many other causes of
relentless pain, it’s important to work on controlling that medical condition
as best you can. Sure, it can be an endless drag, with doctors’ appointments,
medications, physical therapy, exercise, proper nutrition, and so on filling
your entire day. Enough already! Maybe you’d rather just collapse in a 
comfy chair in front of the tube and watch your favorite soap to find out
whether Lois Loveless’ eighth husband really was cheating on her while 
she had amnesia.
Forget about Lois and put yourself first instead. Once you get the hang of
making these activities a regular part of your routine, you’ll feel much better.
And, if you still have pain, it will be much more manageable for you.

Don’t Be a Couch Potato
A common cause of chronic pain is deconditioning, or getting badly out of
shape, which can lead to more pain than whatever condition started this
whole mess you’re in to begin with. You need to know that deconditioning is
often caused by couch potato-ism.
When you lie about watching TV or bemoaning your chronic pain (or both),
your muscles lose their strength and endurance, your joints stiffen, your pos-
ture collapses, and you also lose cardiovascular strength — not good! (See
Chapters 3 and 19 for lots of tips on avoiding deconditioning.) Take a walk,
ride your bike, and do whatever you can (with your doctor’s approval) to get
moving again.
If You’re Overweight, Lose Those Pounds
Are you a chocoholic? Is your secret passion gummy bears? Indulging 
every once and awhile is usually okay, but eating healthy food (see 
Chapter 18) and exercising (see Chapter 19) are both true essentials to 
maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding deconditioning (see preceding 
section), and controlling pain. As a general rule, do your best to maintain 
a healthy weight.
A great resource for discovering a healthy weight for you (and getting there)
is Dieting For Dummies (Wiley) by Jane Kirby, RD, and the American Dietetic
Association.
Avoid Pain Triggers
Hopefully, you’ve used a pain diary to figure out what triggers your pain. 
(See Chapter 17 for information on keeping pain diaries.) It’s easy to think,
“Oh, I feel so much better now, so I’m sure it’s okay if I eat that extra piece 
of cake, play on the Internet for hours on end without a break, or stay up
really late tonight.” Then, wham! Irritable bowel syndrome kicks in, or 
the arthritis in your neck starts hurting from leaning over the keyboard, 
or maybe a massive migraine strikes. So, in advance, say no to pain 
triggers!
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Let Stress Pile on to Your Pain
Stress is the result of how you react to your world, and heightened stress
equals heightened pain. Life is often stressful, but you can learn to relax. 
For example, adopt healthy breathing techniques. (When people are under
stress, they tend to breathe shallowly.)
Or memorize a funny poem and recite it in your mind whenever you feel
stress coming on (or you feel like honking madly at the slow driver in front 
of you, causing you to have a stress attack because you’re late to your 
daughter’s piano recital.) Singing or humming a rhyme is even better than
reciting it. Try something along these lines:
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Eating a Big Mac and fries
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
“Yuck,” it said, “I prefer flies”
Many other good techniques are available to reduce stress, such as distrac-
tion and expressive writing. You can read about these techniques in 
Chapter 22.
Don’t Neglect Your Sleep
Chronic pain is exhausting. If you don’t usually get adequate sleep, you’re 
not alone. The majority of people who wake up too early because of chronic
pain are unable to fall back to sleep. In this case, don’t go with the majority!
You need to get enough Zzzzzs.
The first rule for getting adequate sleep is to maintain a regular time to go to
bed and to wake up at the same time every morning, including on weekends.
For other techniques, see Chapter 20.
Don’t Let Depression Persist
Chronic pain can be depressing. The first step toward beating depression 
is to accept that you or your loved one needs help and then go find that 
help. (See Chapter 3 for a list of the signs and symptoms of depression.) The
good news is that depression is highly treatable, and Chapter 22 helps you
manage your pain with lifestyle changes.
333
Chapter 29: Ten Things to Avoid When You Have Chronic Pain

In addition, here’s another great resource:
National Mental Health Information Center; phone 1-800-789-2647; Web site
http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov. The center provides information
about mental health via a toll-free telephone number, a Web site, and more
than 600 publications that you can request online.
Don’t Ignore New Pain Problems
You may be so used to your chronic pain condition that if a new type of pain
pops up, you automatically think, “Oh, it’s just another symptom of the same
old thing.” But just because you often get migraines doesn’t mean you’re
immune from getting a brain aneurysm, which is a true emergency. Or, just
because you have central pain syndrome doesn’t mean that you can’t
develop peripheral neuropathy. Again, this situation is when your pain diary
can come in handy. (See Chapter 17 for information on pain diaries.) If you’re
suddenly tracking new types of pain — particularly if the pain is severe — be
sure to see your doctor.
Don’t Forget Your Rights 
as a Health Consumer
You’re the only one who knows how you feel, and you have to live with the
results of your medical treatment. However, you may not know about your
rights as a medical consumer. The President’s Advisory Commission on
Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry adopted a list
of consumer rights and responsibilities in 1998. Many health plans (hopefully
yours) have adopted these principles, which are good to keep in mind.
Here are six key consumer rights that are important to the medical 
management of your pain:
 Information disclosure: The right to receive accurate, easily 
understood information to make an informed health-care decision.
 Choice of providers and plans: The right to a choice of health-care
providers that’s sufficient to ensure your access to appropriate 
high-quality healthcare.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Access to emergency services: The right to access emergency health-
care services if the need arises.
 Participation in treatment decisions: The right to fully participate in all
decisions related to your healthcare. If you’re unable to fully participate
in treatment decisions, you have the right to be represented by a
spouse, parents, guardians, adult children, or someone else.
 Respect and nondiscrimination: The right to considerate, respectful
care from all members of the health-care system at all times and under
all circumstances.
 Confidentiality of health information: The right to communicate with
health-care providers in confidence and have the confidentiality of your
individually identifiable health-care information protected. You also
have the right to review and copy your medical records and request any
needed amendments.
Don’t Complain Too Much
Yes, maybe you’re in your third year of constant pain, and that’s a drag. 
And okay, maybe your spouse, kids, and colleagues were sympathetic for 
the first few months. But now you think, “No one pays attention to me 
any more!” Well, maybe you talk a little too much (or a lot) about your
chronic pain.
The hard truth is, people get tired of hearing the same old complaints, even 
if they’re very real. Here’s a good general rule: When talking to other people,
unless you’re in the middle of a medical emergency, keep the conversation 
off your pain and the condition causing it. Concentrate instead on the other
person or talk about something positive in your life. (Come on, you can think
of something!) Keep it up for a month or so, and this behavior will become 
a new good habit.
