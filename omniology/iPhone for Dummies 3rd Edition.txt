About the Authors
Edward C. Baig writes the weekly Personal Technology column in USA 
TODAY and is co-host of the weekly USA TODAY’s Talking Tech podcast with 
Jefferson Graham. Ed is also the author of Macs For Dummies, 10th Ed. (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.). Before joining USA TODAY as a columnist and reporter in 
1999, Ed spent six years at Business Week, where he wrote and edited stories 
about consumer tech, personal fi nance, collectibles, travel, and wine tast-
ing, among other topics. He received the Medill School of Journalism 1999 
Financial Writers and Editors Award for contributions to the “Business Week 
Investor Guide to Online Investing.” That followed a three-year stint at U.S. 
News & World Report, where Ed was the lead tech writer for the News You 
Can Use section but also dabbled in numerous other subjects.
Ed began his journalist career at Fortune magazine, gaining the best basic 
training imaginable during his early years as a fact checker and contributor 
to the Fortune 500. Through the dozen years he worked at the magazine, Ed 
covered leisure-time industries, penned features on the lucrative “dating” 
market and the effect of religion on corporate managers, and was heavily 
involved in the Most Admired Companies project. Ed also started up 
Fortune’s Products to Watch column, a venue for low- and high-tech items.
Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written or co-written more 
than 50 popular computer books, including Mac OS X Snow Leopard For 
Dummies and Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2008 for Mac For Dummies for Wiley Publishing, 
Inc.; Stupid Mac Tricks and Dr. Macintosh for Addison-Wesley; and The Little 
iTunes Book, 3rd Ed., and The Little iDVD Book, 2nd Ed., for Peachpit Press. 
His books have sold more than one million copies worldwide. Bob has 
penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the Houston Chronicle for the past 
ten years and has been published in pretty much every magazine that ever 
used the word Mac in its title. His achievements have been documented in 
major media around the world. (Yes, that was Bob juggling a keyboard in USA 
TODAY a few years back!)
Bob is known for his expertise, trademark humorous style, and ability to 
translate techie jargon into usable and fun advice for regular folks. Bob is 
also a prolifi c public speaker, presenting more than 100 Macworld Expo train-
ing sessions in the U.S. and abroad, keynote addresses in three countries, 
and Macintosh training seminars in many U.S. cities.

Dedications
I dedicate this book to my beautiful and amazingly supportive wife, Janie, 
for making me a better person every day I am with her. And to my incred-
ible kids: my adorable little girl, Sydney (one of her fi rst words was “iPod”), 
my little boy, Sammy (who is all smiles from the moment he wakes up in the 
morning), and, of course, my canine “son,” Eddie. They all got their hands (or 
paws) on the iPhone at one time or another. I am madly in love with you all.
— Ed Baig
This book is dedicated to my wonderful wife, Lisa, who taught me almost 
everything I know about almost everything except computers. And to my 
children, Allison and Jacob, who love their iPhones almost as much as I love 
them (my kids, not my iPhone).
— Bob LeVitus

quickly: Katie Cotton, Natalie Kerris, Greg (Joz) Joswiak, Bob Borchers, John 
Richey, Keri Walker, Teresa Brewer, Tom Neumayr,  Jennifer Bowcock, and

Bob adds: Thanks also to super-agent Carole “The Swifty Lazar of Tech 
Agentry” Jelen, for deal-making beyond the call of duty, yet again. You’ve been 
my agent for over 20 years and you’re still a treasure. And thanks also to my 
family and friends for putting up with me throughout my hibernation during 
this book’s gestation. Finally, thanks to Saccone’s and Home Slice for killer 
thin-crust pizza, The Iron Works and Black’s for BBQ beyond compare, Chuy’s 
for burritos as big as yo’ face, Mighty Fine for cheap, tasty burgers, and Diet

Dummies author. It is a privilege to be working with you again. I’d also like 
to thank Jim Henderson, Geri Tucker, Nancy Blair, and the rest of my USA 
TODAY friends and colleagues (in and out of the Money section) for your 
enormous support and encouragement. Most of all, thanks to my loving 
family for understanding my nightly (and weekend) disappearances as we 
raced to get this project completed on time.
And fi nally, thanks to you, gentle reader, for buying our book.

iPhone For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Introduction
P
recious few products ever come close to generating the kind of buzz 
seen with the iPhone. Its messianic arrival received front-page treat-
ment in newspapers and top billing on network and cable TV shows. People 
lined up days in advance just to ensure landing one of the first units. Years 
from now, people will insist, “I was one of them.”
But we trust you didn’t pick up this book to read yet another account about 
how the iPhone launch was an epochal event. We trust you did buy the book 
to find out how to get the very most out of your remarkable device. Our goal 
is to deliver that information in a light and breezy fashion. We expect you 
to have fun using your iPhone. We equally hope you have fun spending time 
with us.
About This Book
Let’s get one thing out of the way right from the get-go. We think you’re 
pretty darn smart for buying a For Dummies book. That says to us that you 
have the confidence and intelligence to know what you don’t know. The For 
Dummies franchise is built around the core notion that all of us feel insecure 
about certain topics when tackling them for the first time, especially when 
those topics have to do with technology.
As with most Apple products, the iPhone is beautifully designed and intui-
tive to use. And though our editors may not want us to reveal this dirty little 
secret (especially on the first page, for goodness sake), the truth is you’ll get 
pretty far just by exploring the iPhone’s many functions and features on your 
own, without the help of this (or any other) book.
Okay, now that we spilled the beans, let’s tell you why you shouldn’t run 
back to the bookstore and request a refund. This book is chock-full of useful 
tips, advice, and other nuggets that should make your iPhone experience all 
the more pleasurable. So keep this book nearby and consult it often.
Conventions Used in This Book
First, we want to tell you how we go about our business. iPhone For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, makes generous use of numbered steps, bullet lists, and pictures. 
Web addresses are shown in a special monofont typeface, like this.

iPhone For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
We also include a few sidebars with information that is not required reading 
(not that any of this book is) but that we hope will provide a richer under-
standing of certain subjects. Overall, we aim to keep technical jargon to a 
minimum, under the guiding principle that with rare exceptions you need not 
know what any of it really means.
How This Book Is Organized
Here’s something we imagine you’ve never heard before: Most books have 
a beginning, a middle, and an end, and you do well to adhere to that linear 
structure — unless you’re one of those knuckleheads out to ruin it for the 
rest of us by revealing that the butler did it.
Fortunately, there is no ending to spoil in a For Dummies book. So although 
you may want to digest this book from start to finish — and we hope you 
do — we won’t penalize you for skipping ahead or jumping around. Having 
said that, we organized iPhone For Dummies, 3rd Edition, in an order that we 
think makes the most sense, as follows.
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone
In the introductory chapters of Part I, you tour the iPhone inside and out, 
find out how to activate the phone with Apple’s partner in the United States, 
AT&T, and get hands-on (or, more precisely, fingers-on) experience with the 
iPhone’s unique virtual multitouch display.
Part II: The Mobile iPhone
There’s a reason the iPhone has phone in its name. Part II is mostly about all 
the ways you can make and receive calls on the device. But you also discover 
how to exchange text messages and play with the Calendar, Clock, Calculator, 
and Voice Memo applications.
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone
Part III is where the fun truly begins. This is the iPhone as an iPod, a camera, 
and yes, even a camcorder, meaning that music, videos, movies, pictures, 
and other diversions come to life.
Part IV: The Internet iPhone
Part IV covers the mobile Internet. You master the Safari browser, e-mail, 
maps, and more. We discuss the faster 3G, or third-generation, wireless net-
work that the latest iPhone can tap into. And speaking of maps, your iPhone 

3
 Introduction
has the capability to locate your whereabouts through GPS (in the case of the 
iPhone 3G and 3GS) and other location-tracking methods.
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone
In Part V, you find out how to apply your preferences through the iPhone’s 
internal settings, how to find and obtain new applications at the iTunes App 
Store, and discover where to go for troubleshooting assistance if your iPhone 
should misbehave.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens: Otherwise known as the For Dummies answer to David 
Letterman. The lists presented in Part VI steer you to some of our favorite 
iPhone apps as well as some very handy tips and shortcuts.
Icons Used in This Book
Little round pictures (icons) appear in the left margins throughout this book. 
Consider these icons miniature road signs, telling you something extra about 
the topic at hand or hammering a point home.
Here’s what the four icons used in this book look like and mean.
 
These are the juicy morsels, shortcuts, and recommendations that might 
make the task at hand faster or easier.
 
This icon emphasizes the stuff we think you ought to retain. You may even 
jot down a note to yourself in the iPhone.
 
Put on your propeller beanie hat and pocket protector; this text includes the 
truly geeky stuff. You can safely ignore this material; but if it weren’t interest-
ing or informative, we wouldn’t have bothered to write it.
 
You wouldn’t intentionally run a stop sign, would you? In the same fashion, 
ignoring warnings may be hazardous to your iPhone and (by extension) your 
wallet. There, you now know how these warning icons work, for you have just 
received your very first warning!

Where to Go from Here
Why straight to Chapter 1, of course (without passing Go).
In all seriousness, we wrote this book for you, so please let us know what 
you think. If we screwed up, confused you, left something out, or — heaven 
forbid — made you angry, drop us a note. And if we hit you with one pun too 
many, it helps to know that as well.
Because writers are people too (believe it or not), we also encourage positive 
feedback if you think it’s warranted. So kindly send e-mail to Ed at baig
dummies@aol.com and to Bob at iPhoneLeVitus@boblevitus.com. 
We’ll do our best to respond to reasonably polite e-mail in a timely fashion.
Most of all, we want to thank you for buying our book. Please enjoy it along 
with your new iPhone.
Note: At the time we wrote this book, all the information it contained was 
accurate for the original iPhone, the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 3GS, and the 
latest versions of the iPhone OS (operating system) and iTunes. Apple is 
likely to introduce a new iPhone model or new versions of the operating 
system and iTunes between book editions. If you’ve bought a new iPhone 
or your version of iTunes looks a little different, be sure to check out what 
Apple has to say at www.apple.com/iphone. You’ll no doubt find updates 
on the company’s latest releases.

Part I
Getting to Know 
Your iPhone

You have to crawl before you walk, so consider 
this part basic training for crawling. The three 
chapters that make up Part I serve as a gentle intro-
duction to your iPhone.
We start out nice and easy in Chapter 1, with a 
big-picture overview, even letting you know 
what’s in the box (if you haven’t already peeked). 
Then we examine just some of the cool things 
your iPhone can do. We ﬁ nish things off with a 
quick-and-dirty tour of the hardware and the soft-
ware, so that you’ll know where things are when 
you need them.
Next, after you’re somewhat familiar with where 
things are and what they do, we move right along 
to a bunch of useful iPhone skills, such as turning 
the darn thing on and off (which is very impor-
tant) and locking and unlocking your phone 
(which is also very important). Chapter 2 ends 
with useful tips and tricks to help you master 
iPhone’s unique multitouch interface so that you 
can use it effectively and efﬁ ciently.
Then, in Chapter 3, we explore the process of 
synchronization and how to get data — contacts, 
appointments, movies, songs, podcasts, and 
such — from your computer into your iPhone, 
quickly and painlessly.

Unveiling the iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the big picture
▶ Touring the outside of the iPhone
▶ Checking out the iPhone’s applications
C
ongratulations. You’ve selected one of the most incredible handheld 
devices we’ve ever seen. Of course, the iPhone is one heck of a wireless 
telephone, but it’s actually four awesome handheld devices in one. In addi-
tion to being a killer cell phone, it’s a gorgeous widescreen video iPod, 
a decent 2-megapixel digital camera (original iPhone and iPhone 3G) or 
3-megapixel camera/camcorder (iPhone 3GS), as well as the smallest, 
most powerful Internet communications device yet.
In this chapter, we offer a gentle introduction to all four 
devices that make up your iPhone, plus overviews of its 
revolutionary hardware and software features.
The Big Picture
The iPhone has many best-of-class features, but 
perhaps its most unusual feature is the lack of 
a physical keyboard or stylus. Instead, it has a 
31/2-inch super-high-resolution touchscreen (160 
pixels per inch if you care about such things) that 
you operate using a pointing device you’re already 
intimately familiar with: your finger.
And what a display it is. We venture that you’ve never seen a 
more beautiful screen on a handheld device in your life.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Another feature that knocked our socks off was the iPhone’s built-in sensors. 
An accelerometer detects when you rotate the device from portrait to land-
scape mode and adjusts what’s on the display accordingly. A proximity 
sensor detects when the iPhone gets near your face, so it can turn off the 
display to save power and prevent accidental touches by your cheek. And 
a light sensor adjusts the display’s brightness in response to the current 
ambient lighting situation. (Let’s see your Blackberry do that!)
In this section, we take a brief look at some of the iPhone’s features, broken 
down by product category.
The iPhone as a phone and digital camera/camcorder
On the phone side, the iPhone synchronizes with the contacts and calendars 
on your Mac or PC. It includes a full-featured QWERTY soft, or virtual, key-
board, which makes typing text easier than ever before — for some folks. 
What’s in the box
Somehow we think you’ve already opened the 
handsome black box that the iPhone came in. 
But if you didn’t, here’s what you can expect to 
find inside:
 ✓ Stereo headset: Use this headset for music 
videos and, yes, phone calls. The headset 
contains a built-in microphone for making 
yourself heard during phone calls.
 ✓ Dock connector–to–USB cable: Use this 
handy cable to sync or charge your iPhone. 
You can plug the USB connector into your 
PC or Macintosh to sync or plug it into the 
USB power adapter, which is described 
next.
 ✓ USB power adapter: Use this adapter to 
recharge your iPhone from a standard AC 
power outlet.
 ✓ Some Apple logo decals: Of course.
 ✓ Cleaning cloth: Expect to get smudges on 
the iPhone. Use the cloth to wipe it clean. 
We’d steer clear of Lemon Pledge.
 ✓ Finger Tips pamphlet: You’ll find handy tips 
from Apple on using the new object of your 
affection.
 ✓ Important Product Information Guide pam-
phlet: Well, it must be important because it 
says so right on the cover. You’ll find basic 
safety warnings, a bunch of legalese, war-
ranty information, and info on how to dis-
pose of or recycle the iPhone. What! We’re 
getting rid of it already? A few other pieces 
of advice: Don’t drop the iPhone if you can 
help it, keep the thing dry, and — as with all 
cell phones — give full attention to the road 
while driving.
 ✓ SIM eject tool: Use this tool instead of a 
bent paper clip in the event you need to 
eject your SIM card. There’s even a handy 
diagram showing how to use the SIM eject 
tool inside the little black folder the tool is 
affixed to.
 ✓ iPhone: You were starting to worry. Yes, the 
iPhone itself is also in the box.

 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
Granted, the virtual keyboard takes a bit of time to get used to. But we think 
that many of you eventually will be whizzing along at a much faster pace than 
you thought possible on a mobile keyboard of this type.
The 2-megapixel (iPhone and iPhone 3G) or 3-megapixel (iPhone 3GS) digital 
camera is accompanied by a decent photo management application, so taking 
and managing digital photos (and videos on iPhone 3GS) is a pleasure rather 
than the nightmare it can be on other phones. Plus, you can automatically 
synchronize iPhone photos and videos with the digital photo library on your 
Mac or PC. Okay, we still wish the iPhone camera took better photos and 
shot better video but it is still much better than most other phone cameras.
Finally, one of our favorite phone accoutrements is visual voicemail. (Try 
saying that three times fast.) This feature lets you see a list of voicemail 
messages and choose which ones to listen to or delete without being forced 
to deal with every message in your voice mailbox in sequential order. Now, 
that’s handy!
Those are merely a few of the iPhone’s excellent telephony features. Because 
we still have many more chapters to go, we’ll put the phone (and camera) 
coverage on hold for now (pun intended).
The iPhone as an iPod
We agree with Steve Jobs on this one: The iPhone is a better iPod than 
almost any that Apple has ever made. (Okay, we can quibble about the 
iPod Touch or wanting more storage.) You can enjoy all your existing iPod 
content — music, audiobooks, audio and video podcasts, music videos, tele-
vision shows, and movies — on the iPhone’s gorgeous high-resolution color 
display, which is bigger, brighter, and richer than any iPod display that came 
before it.
Bottom line: If you can get the content — be it video, audio, or whatever — 
into iTunes on your Mac or PC, you can synchronize it and watch or listen to 
it on your iPhone.
The iPhone as an Internet communications device
But wait — there’s more! Not only is the iPhone a great phone and a stellar 
iPod, but it’s also a full-featured Internet communications device with — 
we’re about to drop a bit of industry jargon on you — a rich HTML e-mail 
client that’s compatible with most POP and IMAP mail services, with support 
for Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. (For more on this topic, see Chapter 11.) 
Also on board is a world-class Web browser (Safari) that, unlike on other 
phones, makes Web surfing fun and easy.

10
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Another cool Internet feature is Maps, a killer mapping application based on 
Google Maps. By using GPS (3G or 3GS hardware) or triangulation (on the 
original iPhone), it can determine your location, let you view maps and satel-
lite imagery, and obtain driving directions and traffic information regardless 
of where in the United States you happen to be. You can also find businesses 
such as gas stations, pizza restaurants, hospitals, and Apple stores with just 
a few taps. And the Compass application (3GS only) not only displays your 
current GPS coordinates but also orients Maps to show the direction you’re 
facing. Let’s see your Nokia do that!
You might also enjoy using Stocks, a built-in application that delivers near 
real-time stock quotes and charts any time and any place, or Weather, 
another built-in app that obtains and displays the weather forecast for as 
many cities as you like.
The Internet experience on an iPhone is far superior to the Internet experi-
ence on any other handheld device.
Technical specifications
One last thing before we proceed. Here’s a list of everything you need before 
you can actually use your iPhone:
 
✓ An original iPhone, iPhone 3G, or the new iPhone 3GS
 
✓ A wireless contract with AT&T (formerly Cingular) in the U.S.
 
✓ An iTunes Store account
 
✓ Internet access (required) — broadband wireless Internet access 
recommended
Plus you need one of the following:
 
✓ A Mac with a USB 2.0 port; Mac OS X version 10.4.11 or later; and iTunes 
8.2 or later
 
✓ A PC with a USB 2.0 port; Windows Vista or Windows XP Home or 
Professional with Service Pack 2 or later; and iTunes 8.2 or later
A Quick Tour Outside
The iPhone is a harmonious combination of hardware and software. In this 
section, we take a brief look at what’s on the outside. In the next section, we 
peek at the software.

11
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
On the top
On the top of your iPhone, you’ll find the headset jack, the SIM card tray, and 
the Sleep/Wake button, as shown in Figure 1-1:
 
✓ The Sleep/Wake button: This button is used to lock or unlock your 
iPhone and to turn your iPhone on or off. When your iPhone is locked, 
you can still receive calls and text messages but nothing happens if you 
touch its screen. When your iPhone is turned off, all incoming calls go 
directly to voicemail.
 
✓ SIM card tray: The SIM card tray is where you remove or replace the 
SIM card inside your iPhone.
 
 A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a removable smart card used 
to identify mobile phones. It allows users to change phones by moving 
the SIM card from one phone to another.
 
✓ Headset jack: The headset jack lets you plug in the included iPhone 
headset, which looks a lot like white iPod earbuds. Unlike the iPod ear-
buds, however, the iPhone headset has a microphone so that you can 
talk as well as listen.
 
 The headset jack on the original iPhone is recessed, so most third-party 
earphones (such as those made by Shure, Etymotic, and Future Sonics) 
won’t work with it. However, you can buy an adapter (starting at around 
$11) from companies such as Belkin that enables you to use just about 
any brand or style of earphones you like with your iPhone. Fortunately, 
Apple listened to customers. The iPhone 3G and 3GS don’t have a 
recessed headset jack and don’t require an adapter.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
On the bottom
On the bottom of your iPhone, you’ll find the speaker, dock connector, and 
microphone, as shown in Figure 1-2:
 
✓ Speaker: The speaker is used by the iPhone’s built-in speakerphone and 
plays audio — music or video soundtracks — if no headset is plugged in. 
It also plays the ringtone you hear when you receive a call.
 
Speaker

Microphone
 
Figure 1-2: The bottom side of the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS looks like this.
 
✓ Dock connector: The dock connector has two purposes. One, you can 
use it to recharge your iPhone’s battery: Simply connect one end of the 
included dock connector–to–USB cable to the dock connector and the 
other end to the USB power adapter. Two, you can use the dock connec-
tor to recharge your iPhone’s battery as well as synchronize: Connect 
one end of the same cable to the dock connector and the other end to a 
USB port on your Mac or PC.
 
✓ Microphone: The microphone lets callers hear your voice when you’re 
not using a headset.
On the sides and front
On the front of your iPhone you’ll find the following (labeled in Figure 1-3):
 
✓ Ring/Silent switch: The Ring/Silent switch, which is on the left side 
of your iPhone, lets you quickly switch between ring mode and silent 
mode. When the switch is set to ring mode — the up position, with no 
orange dot — your iPhone plays all sounds through the speaker on the 
bottom. When the switch is set to silent mode — the down position, 
with an orange dot visible on the switch — your iPhone doesn’t make a 
sound when you receive a call or when an alert pops up on the screen.
 
 The only exceptions to silent mode are alarms you set in the built-in 
Clock application, which do sound regardless of the Ring/Silent switch 
setting.

13
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
 
 If your phone is set to ring mode and you want to silence it quickly, you 
can press the Sleep/Wake button on the top of the iPhone or press one 
of the Volume buttons.

Figure 1-3: The front of the iPhone 3G is a study in elegant simplicity.
 
✓ Volume buttons: Two Volume buttons are just below the Ring/Silent 
switch. The upper button increases the volume; the lower one decreases 
it. You use the Volume buttons to raise or lower the loudness of the 
ringer, alerts, sound effects, songs, and movies. And during phone calls, 
the buttons adjust the loudness of the person you’re speaking with, 
regardless of whether you’re listening through the receiver, the speaker-
phone, or a headset.
 
✓ Receiver: The receiver is the speaker that the iPhone uses for telephone 
calls. It naturally sits close to your ear whenever you hold your iPhone 
in the “talking on the phone” position.
 
 You should be the only one who hears sound coming from the receiver. 
If you have the volume set above about 50 percent and you’re in a loca-
tion with little or no background noise, someone standing nearby may 
be able to hear the sound, too. So be careful.

14
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
 If you require privacy during phone calls, the included Apple headset 
(or an optional Bluetooth headset — as discussed in Chapter 13) is a 
better bet.
 
✓ Touchscreen: You find out how to use the iPhone’s gorgeous high-
resolution color touchscreen in Chapter 2. All we have to say at this 
time is . . . try not to drool all over it.
 
✓ Home button: No matter what you’re doing, you can press the Home 
button at any time to display the Home screen, which is the screen 
shown in Figure 1-3.
 
✓ Application buttons: Each of the 19 (iPhone and iPhone 3G) or 20 
(iPhone 3GS) buttons launches an included iPhone application. You’ll 
read more about these applications later in this chapter and throughout 
the rest of the book.
On the back
On the back of your iPhone is the camera lens. It’s the little circle in the top-
left corner. For more on the camera, see Chapter 9.
Status bar
The status bar, which is at the top of the screen, displays tiny icons that pro-
vide a variety of information about the current state of your iPhone:
 
 
✓ Cell signal: The cell-signal icon tells you whether you’re within range of 
your wireless telephone carrier’s cellular network and therefore can 
make and receive calls. The more bars you see (five is the highest), the 
stronger the cellular signal. If you’re out of range, the bars are replaced 
with the words No service.
 
 If you have only one or two bars, try moving around a little bit. Even 
walking just a few feet can sometimes mean the difference between no 
service and three or four bars.
 
 
✓ Airplane mode: You’re allowed to use your iPod on a plane after the 
captain gives the word. But you can’t use your cell phone except when 
the plane is in the gate area before takeoff or after landing. Fortunately, 
your iPhone offers an airplane mode, which turns off all wireless fea-
tures of your iPhone — the cellular, 3G, GPRS (General Packet Radio 
Service), and EDGE networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth — and makes it pos-
sible to enjoy music or video during your flight.

15
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
 
 
✓ 3G: This icon informs you that the high-speed 3G data network from 
your wireless carrier (that’s AT&T in the United States) is available and 
that your iPhone can connect to the Internet via 3G.
 
 
✓ GPRS: This icon says that your wireless carrier’s GPRS data network is 
available and that your iPhone can use it to connect to the Internet.
 
 
✓ EDGE: This icon tells you that your wireless carrier’s EDGE network is 
available and you can use it to connect to the Internet.
 
 
✓ Wi-Fi: If you see the Wi-Fi icon, it means your iPhone is connected to the 
Internet over a Wi-Fi network. The more semicircular lines you see (up 
to three), the stronger the Wi-Fi signal. If you have only one or two semi-
circles of Wi-Fi strength, try moving around a bit. If you don’t see the 
Wi-Fi icon in the status bar, Internet access is not currently available.
 
 Wireless (that is, cellular) carriers may offer one of three data networks. 
The fastest is a 3G data network, which, as you probably guessed, is 
available only on the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS. The device first looks 
for a 3G network and then, if it can’t find one, looks for a slower EDGE or 
GPRS data network.
 
 Wi-Fi networks, however, are even faster than any cellular data 
network — 3G, EDGE, or GPRS. So all iPhones will connect to a Wi-Fi 
network if one is available, even if a 3G, GPRS, or EDGE network is also 
available.
 
 Last but not least, if you don’t see one of these icons — 3G, GPRS, EDGE, 
or Wi-Fi — you don’t currently have Internet access.
 
 
✓ Network Activity: This icon tells you that some network activity is 
occurring, such as over-the-air synchronization, sending or receiving 
e-mail, or loading a Web page. Some third-party applications also use 
this icon to indicate network or other activity.
 
 
✓ VPN: This icon shows that you are currently connected to a virtual pri-
vate network (VPN).
 
 
✓ Lock: This icon tells you when your iPhone is locked. See Chapter 2 for 
information on locking and unlocking your iPhone.
 
 
✓ Play: This icon informs you that a song is currently playing. You find out 
more about playing songs in Chapter 7.
 
 
✓ Alarm: This icon tells you that you have set one or more alarms in the 
Clock application.
 
 
✓ Bluetooth: This icon indicates the current state of your iPhone’s Blue-
tooth connection. If it’s blue, Bluetooth is on and a device (such as a 
wireless headset or car kit) is connected. If the icon is gray, Bluetooth is 

16
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
turned on but no device is connected. If you don’t see a Bluetooth icon 
at all, Bluetooth is turned off. Chapter 13 goes into more detail about 
Bluetooth.
 
 
✓ Bluetooth headset battery: This icon displays the battery level for your 
optional Apple iPhone Bluetooth headset (suggested retail price $99) if 
you have one and it’s currently paired with your iPhone.
 
 
✓ Battery: This icon reflects the level of your battery’s charge. It’s com-
pletely filled with green when your battery is fully charged, and then 
empties as your battery becomes depleted. You’ll see a lightning bolt 
inside it when your iPhone is recharging.
 
 
✓ TTY: This icon informs you that your iPhone is set up to work with a 
teletype (TTY) machine for those who are hearing- or speech-impaired.
 
 You need an optional Apple iPhone TTY Adapter (suggested retail price 
$19) to connect your iPhone to a TTY machine.
The iPhone’s Nifty Nineteen or Terrific Twenty
The Home screen offers 19 (iPhone and iPhone 3G) or 20 (iPhone 3GS) icons 
by default, each representing a different built-in application or function. 
Because the rest of the book covers each and every one of these babies in full 
and loving detail, we merely provide brief descriptions here.
To get to your Home screen, tap the Home button. If your iPhone is asleep 
when you tap, the unlock screen appears. Once unlocked, you’ll see which-
ever page of icons was on the screen when it went to sleep. If that happens to 
have been the Home screen, you’re golden. If it wasn’t, merely tap the Home 
button again to summon your iPhone’s Home screen.
 
Three steps let you rearrange icons on your iPhone:
 
1. Press and hold any icon until all of the icons begin to “wiggle.”
 
2. Drag the icons around until you’re happy with their positions.
 
3. Press the Home button to save your arrangement and stop the 
“wiggling.”
If you haven’t rearranged your icons, you’ll see the following applications on 
your Home screen, starting at the top left:
 
✓ Messages: The Messages application lets you exchange text (SMS) and 
multimedia (MMS) messages with almost any other cell phone user. Or, 
more accurately, it will as soon as AT&T begins to offer MMS support in 

17
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
the United States, as described in Chapter 5. In any event, we’ve used a 
lot of mobile phones in our day and this application is as good as it gets.
 
✓ Calendar: No matter what calendar program you prefer on your PC or 
Mac (as long as it’s iCal, Microsoft Entourage, or Microsoft Outlook), 
you can synchronize events and alerts between your computer and your 
iPhone. Create an event on one and it’s automatically synchronized with 
the other the next time they’re connected. Neat stuff.
 
✓ Photos: This application is the iPhone’s terrific photo manager. You can 
view pictures that you took with the iPhone’s built-in camera or trans-
ferred from your computer. You can zoom in or out, create slideshows, 
e-mail photos to friends, and much more. Other phones may let you take 
pictures; the iPhone lets you enjoy them in many ways.
 
✓ Camera: Use this application when you want to shoot a picture with the 
iPhone’s 2 (iPhone and iPhone 3G) or 3-megapixel (iPhone 3GS) camera.
 
✓ YouTube: This application lets you watch videos from the popular 
YouTube Web site. You can search for a particular video or browse 
through thousands of offerings. It’s a great way to waste a lot of time.
 
✓ Stocks: If you follow the market, this application lets you monitor your 
favorite stocks, which are updated in near-real time.
 
✓ Maps: This application is among our favorites. View street maps or satel-
lite imagery of locations around the globe, or ask for directions, traffic 
conditions, or even the location of a nearby pizza joint.
 
✓ Weather: This application monitors the six-day weather forecast for as 
many cities as you like.
 
✓ Voice Memos: New in iPhone OS 3.0, this handy little application turns 
your iPhone into a convenient handheld recording device.
 
✓ Notes: This program lets you type notes while you’re out and about. You 
can send the notes to yourself or anyone else through e-mail or just save 
them on your iPhone until you need them.
 
✓ Clock: This program lets you see the current time in as many cities as 
you like, set one or more alarms for yourself, and use your iPhone as a 
stopwatch or a countdown timer.
 
✓ Calculator: The Calculator application lets you perform addition, sub-
traction, multiplication, and division. Period.
 
✓ Settings: Use this application to adjust your iPhone’s settings. If you’re 
a Mac user, think System Preferences; if you’re a Windows person, think 
Control Panel.
 
✓ iTunes: Tap here to access the iTunes Store, where you can browse, pre-
view, and purchase songs, albums, movies, and more.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
✓ App Store: This icon enables you to connect to and search the iTunes 
App Store for iPhone applications you can purchase or download for 
free over a Wi-Fi or cellular data network connection.
 
✓ Compass (iPhone 3GS only): Kind of like having a magnetic needle com-
pass inside your iPhone, but better.
 
✓ Phone: Tap this application icon to use the iPhone as a phone. What a 
concept!
 
✓ Mail: This application lets you send and receive e-mail with most POP3 
and IMAP e-mail systems and, if you work for a company that grants per-
mission, Microsoft Exchange accounts, too.
 
✓ Safari: Safari is your Web browser. If you’re a Mac user, you know that 
already; if you’re a Windows user who hasn’t already discovered the 
wonderful Safari for Windows, think Internet Explorer on steroids.
 
✓ iPod: Last but not least, this icon unleashes all the power of a video iPod 
right on your phone.
Okay, then. Now that you and your iPhone have been properly introduced, 
it’s time to turn it on, activate it, and actually use it. Onward!

B
y now you know that the iPhone is very different from other cell 
phones. If you got caught up in the initial iPhone frenzy of 2007, you 
may have plotted for months about how to land one. After all, the iPhone 
quickly emerged as the ultimate fashion phone. And the chic device 
hosted a bevy of cool features. (Keep reading this book for 
proof.)
To snag the very first version, you may have saved 
your pennies or said, “The budget be damned.” 
Owning the hippest and most-hyped handset on the 
planet came at a premium cost compared with rival 
devices.
Something else was different about the iPhone 
purchasing experience in 2007: the way it was 
activated. No salesperson was going to guide you 
through the process, whether you picked up your 
newly prized possession in an Apple retail store, an 
AT&T retail store, or on the Web. Instead, you had to 
handle activation solo, in the comfort of your home.

20
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Unless you were among those people who experienced activation hiccups in 
the days soon after the phone was released in June 2007, the process of get-
ting up to speed with the iPhone was (for the most part) dirt simple and fun — 
as it is with most products with an Apple pedigree.
Well, forget all that has gone before. You no longer have to break the bank. 
Apple has lowered the price — a lot. As of this writing, the cheapest iPhone 
for new customers starts at $99 — $500 below its stratospheric launch price. 
(Although we are obliged to point out that AT&T’s monthly service plans are 
higher — thus eliminating the cost savings over the course of the required 
two-year contract.) For existing iPhone 3G customers in the United States, 
the upgrade price for a new 3GS phone depends on how far you’re into your 
previous contract with AT&T, how prompt you are at paying your bill, and 
other factors.
Something else has changed — the way you activate the phone. Kindly 
read on.
Activating the iPhone
You’re now supposed to activate the iPhone in the Apple, or AT&T Wireless, 
Best Buy, or Walmart store where you bought the thing, just as you do with 
other cell phones. You’ll choose your desired monthly bucket of voice min-
utes and SMS or text messages.
If you’re already an AT&T subscriber, the salesperson will give you the 
option of keeping your current phone number.
 
It’s not surprising why Apple and AT&T want you in their stores: After they 
get you in the door, they have the opportunity to sell you other stuff. And 
they can help crack down on those techies who want to unlock or “jailbreak” 
the iPhone to defect to a rival carrier.
Otherwise, this time around, the same two prerequisites for enjoying the 
iPhone are in place as with the original release — at least for U.S. customers. 
First, there’s the aforementioned business of becoming an AT&T (formerly 
Cingular) subscriber, unless you’re already in the fold. You’ll have to ink that 
new two-year term. If you’re in the middle of a contract with a rival carrier, 
read the sidebar titled “The Great Escape: Bailing out of your wireless 
contract.”
Second, make sure you download the latest version of iTunes software onto 
your PC or Mac. Apple doesn’t supply the software in the box, so head to 
www.apple.com/itunes if you need to fetch a copy, or launch your current 
version of iTunes and then choose Check for Updates. You can find it under 
the Help menu on a Windows machine and on the iTunes menu on a Mac.

21
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
For the uninitiated, iTunes is the nifty Apple jukebox software that iPod 
owners and many other people use to manage music, videos, and more. 
iTunes is at the core of the iPhone as well, because an iPod is built into the 
iPhone. You’ll employ iTunes to synchronize a bunch of stuff on your com-
puter and iPhone including: applications, photos, podcasts, videos ringtones, 
and (of course) music.
We get into all that syncing business in Chapter 3.
Turning the iPhone On and Off
Apple has taken the time to partially charge your iPhone, so you’ll get some 
measure of instant gratification. After taking it out of the box, press and hold 
the Sleep/Wake button on the top-right edge. (Refer to Chapter 1 for the loca-
tion of all buttons.) The famous Apple logo should show up on your screen, 
followed a few seconds later by a stunning image of Earth.
Not so subtle, as messages go: Apple has ambitious aspirations about captur-
ing global market share.
To turn the device completely off, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button 
again until a red arrow appears at the top of the screen. Then drag the arrow 
to the right with your finger. Tap Cancel if you change your mind.
Locking the iPhone
Carrying a naked cell phone in your pocket is asking for trouble. Unless the 
phone has some locking mechanism, you may inadvertently dial a phone 
number. Try explaining to your boss why he or she got a call from you at 
4 a.m. Fortunately, Apple makes it a cinch to lock the iPhone so this scenario 
won’t happen to you.
In fact, you don’t need to do anything to lock the iPhone; it happens automat-
ically, as long as you don’t touch the screen for a minute.
Can’t wait? To lock the iPhone immediately, press the Sleep/Wake button. To 
unlock it, press the Sleep/Wake button again. Or press the Home button on 
the front of the screen. Either way, the on-screen slider appears but you can’t 
do anything until you drag the slider to the right with your finger and then in 
some cases also enter a passcode.
By now, you’re picking up on the idea that your fingers play an instrumental 
role in controlling your iPhone. We talk more about the responsibility your 
digits have later in this chapter.

22
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Mastering the Multitouch Interface
Until the iPhone came along, virtually every cell phone known to mankind 
had a physical (typically plastic) dialing keypad, if not also a more complete 
QWERTY-style keyboard, to bang out e-mails and text messages. The iPhone 
dispenses with both. Apple is once again living up to an old company adver-
tising slogan to “Think Different.”
The Great Escape: Bailing out of your
wireless contract
In most instances, a wireless provider will sell 
you a deeply discounted phone or even issue 
you a free model. But there’s one expensive 
catch: You’re subject to hefty termination fees 
if you bail out of your (typical) two-year contract 
early.
The iPhone is one Cingular . . . make that 
AT&T . . . sensation (bad pun intended), so 
you’ll have to wave sayonara to Sprint, Verizon, 
or other carriers if you want this device. But 
breaking a cell phone contract is not easy, and 
some of the options for doing so may not be 
quite the outs you had in mind: You can enlist 
in the military, move overseas, even die. (Sorry, 
but no guarantee that AT&T’s coverage, 3G or 
otherwise, will reach the heavens.)
Fortunately, there are other strategies, although 
none are assured of working:
 ✓ Complain loudly and often: If you’ve been 
having problems with your existing carrier, 
contact the phone company and tell them 
how lousy your coverage is. Document your 
complaints in writing and be as specific as 
possible about spots where your calls drop 
out.
 ✓ Keep an eye out for price hikes: If the 
carrier ups rates dramatically on text 
messaging, say, you may have a legal out 
in your contract. The Consumerist.com 
Web site advises you to read any notices 
of changes to your Terms of Service that 
come your way. These may void the original 
agreement and you’ll have about a month to 
cancel your contract.
 ✓ Use online matchmaking: Sites such as 
www.celltradeusa.com and www.
cellswapper.com are in the business 
of matching users who want to get out of 
their contract with other folks who are seek-
ing a bargain. The person trying to ditch a 
contract pays a modest fee to these sites. 
So what’s the motivation for the person who 
takes the contract off your hands? Those 
who get their phone service this way need 
not pay an activation fee to the carrier, 
and they incur no long-term commitment of 
their own.
 ✓ Roam, roam on the range: If you keep using 
your phone outside your carrier’s network, 
it may become uneconomical for them 
to want to keep you. That’s because your 
phone company picks up expensive roam-
ing charges.

23
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
Indeed, the iPhone removes the usual physical buttons in favor of a multi-
touch display. It is the heart of many things you do on the iPhone, and the 
controls change depending on the task at hand.
Unlike other phones with touchscreens, don’t bother looking for a stylus. 
You are meant, instead — at the risk of lifting another ancient ad slogan — to 
“let your fingers do the walking.”
It’s important to note that there are several keyboard layouts in English, all 
variations on the alphabetical keyboard, the numeric and punctuation key-
board, and the more punctuation and symbols keyboard. Six keyboards are 
shown in Figure 2-1. The layout you see depends on the application you are 
working in. For instance, the keyboards in Safari differ from the keyboards in 
Notes.
The iPhone keyboard contains five keys that don’t actually type a character: 
Shift, Toggle, International keyboard, Delete, and Return:
 
✓ Shift key: If you’re using the alphabetical keyboard, the Shift key 
switches between uppercase and lowercase letters. If you’re using key-
boards that just show numbers and symbols, the traditional Shift key is 
replaced by a key labeled #+= or 123. Pressing that key toggles between 
keyboards that just have symbols and numbers.
 
 To turn on Caps Lock and type in all caps, you first need to enable Caps 
Lock. You do that by tapping the Settings icon, then tapping General, 
and then tapping Keyboard. Tap the Enable Caps Lock item to turn it 
on. After the Caps Lock setting is enabled (it’s disabled by default), you 
double-tap the Shift key to turn on Caps Lock. (The Shift key turns blue 
whenever Caps Lock is on.) Tap the Shift key again to turn off Caps Lock. 
To disable Caps Lock completely, just reverse the process by turning off 
the Enable Caps Lock setting (tap Settings, General, Keyboard).
 
✓ Toggle key: Switches between the different keyboard layouts.
 
✓ International keyboard key: Only shows up if you’ve turned on an inter-
national keyboard, as explained in the sidebar titled “A Keyboard for all 
borders.”
 
✓ Delete key: Erases the character immediately to the left of the cursor.
 
 If you hold down the Delete key for a few seconds, it begins erasing 
entire words rather than individual characters.
 
✓ Return key: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.

 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
A keyboard for all borders
Apple continues to expand the iPhone’s reach 
globally. English isn’t the primary language 
for many overseas customers, if they speak 
English at all. Fortunately, Apple doesn’t take 
a parochial approach with iPhone. As part 
of iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, and version 3.0 of 
iPhone software, the company now supplies 
international keyboard layouts for more than 30 
languages as of this writing. To access a key-
board that isn’t customized for Americanized 
English, tap Settings, General, Keyboard, and 
International Keyboards — and then flick 
through the list to select any keyboard you want 
to use. (Alternatively, tap Settings, General, 
International, and Keyboards.) Up pops the list 
shown in the figure included here, with custom 
keyboards for Russian, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, 
and numerous other languages. Apple even 
supplies two versions of Portuguese to accom-
modate customers in Brazil and Portugal, three 
versions of French (including keyboards geared 
to Canadian and Swiss users), and two versions 
of Chinese. Heck, there’s even a U.K. version of 
English. And let’s not forget “right-to-left” lan-
guages such as Arabic and Hebrew.
Have a multilingual household? You can select 
as many of these international keyboards as you 
might need by tapping the language in the list so 
that the On button appears in blue. Of course, 
you can call upon only one language at a time. 
So when you’re inside an application that sum-
mons a keyboard, tap the little international key-
board button sandwiched between the toggle 
and space keys (refer to Figure 2-1) until the 
keyboard you want to call on for the occasion 
shows up. Tap again to pick the next keyboard 
on the corresponding list of international key-
boards that you turned on in Settings. If you 
keep tapping, you come back to your original 
English keyboard.
One more note about the Chinese keyboards: 
You can use handwriting character recognition 
for simplified and traditional Chinese, as shown 
here. Just drag your finger in the box provided. 
We make apologies in advance for not knowing 
what the displayed characters here mean (nei-
ther of us speaks nor reads Chinese).

The incredible, intelligent, and virtual
iPhone keyboard
Before you consider how to actually use the keyboard, we’d like to share a bit 
of the philosophy behind its so-called intelligence. Knowing what makes this 
keyboard smart will help you make it even smarter when you use it:
 
✓ It has a built-in English dictionary that even includes words from today’s 
popular culture.
 
✓ It adds your contacts to its dictionary automatically.
 
✓ It uses complex analysis algorithms to predict the word you’re trying to 
type.
 
✓ It suggests corrections as you type. It then offers you the suggested 
word just below the misspelled word. When you decline a suggestion 
and the word you typed is not in the iPhone dictionary, the iPhone adds 
that word to its dictionary and offers it as a suggestion if you mistype a 
similar word in the future.
 
 Remember to decline suggestions (by tapping the characters you 
typed as opposed to the suggested words that appear beneath what 
you’ve typed), as doing so helps your intelligent keyboard become even 
smarter.
 
✓ It reduces the number of mistakes you make as you type by intelligently 
and dynamically resizing the touch zones for certain keys. You can’t see 
it, but it is increasing the zones for keys it predicts might come next and 
decreasing the zones for keys that are unlikely or impossible to come 
next.
Training your digits
Rice Krispies has Snap! Crackle! Pop! Apple’s response for the iPhone is Tap! 
Flick! and Pinch! Yikes, another ad comparison.
Fortunately, tapping, flicking, and pinching are not challenging gestures, so 
you’ll be mastering many of the iPhone’s features in no time:
 
✓ Tap: Tapping serves multiple purposes, as will become evident through-
out this book. You can tap an icon to open an application from the Home 
screen. Tap to start playing a song or to choose the photo album you 
want to look through. Sometimes you will double-tap (tapping twice in 
rapid succession), which has the effect of zooming in (or out) of Web 
pages, maps, and e-mails.
 
✓ Flick: Just what it sounds like. A flick of the finger on the screen itself 
lets you quickly scroll through lists of songs, e-mails, and picture 

27
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
thumbnails. Tap on the screen to stop scrolling, or merely wait for the 
scrolling list to stop.
 
✓ Pinch/spread: Place two fingers on the edges of a Web page or picture 
to enlarge the images or make them smaller. Pinching and spreading (or 
what we call unpinching) are cool gestures that are easy to master and 
sure to wow an audience. If you need practice, visit the Apple iPhone 
blogs at
www.theiphoneblogs.com/2007/01/12/practice-your-apple-iphone-pinch/
The Home screen we discuss back in Chapter 1 may not be the only screen 
of icons on your phone. After you start adding apps from the iTunes App 
Store (which you discover in Chapter 14), you may see two or more tiny dots 
between the Phone, Mail, Safari, and iPod icons and the row of icons directly 
above them, plus a tiny Spotlight search magnifying glass to the left of the 
dots. Those dots denote additional screens, each containing up to 16 addi-
tional icons. To navigate between screens, either flick from right to left or left 
to right across the middle of the screen or tap directly on the dots.
 
You must be very precise, or you’ll open one of the application icons instead 
of switching screens.
The number of dots you see represents the current number of screens on 
your iPhone. The dot that’s all white denotes the screen you’re currently 
viewing. Finally, the four icons in the last row — Phone, Mail, Safari, and 
iPod — are in a special part of the screen known as the dock. When you 
switch from screen to screen as described above, these icons remain on the 
screen. In other words, only the first 16 icons on the screen change when you 
move from one screen to another.
Press the Home button to jump back to the first screenful of icons or the 
Home screen. Pressing a second time brings you to a handy new Search fea-
ture that arrived with iPhone OS 3.0 software. We’ll address Search later in 
this chapter.
Finger-typing
Apple’s multitouch interface just might be considered a stroke of genius. And 
it just might as equally drive you nuts, at least initially.
If you’re patient and trusting, you’ll get the hang of finger-typing in a week 
or so. (We’ve gotten quite good at it by now.) You have to rely on the virtual 
keyboard that appears when you tap a text field to enter notes, compose text 
messages, type the names of new contacts, and so forth.

28
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
Apple’s own recommendation — with which we concur — is to start typing 
with just your index finger before graduating to two thumbs.
As we’ve already noted, Apple has built a lot of intelligence into its vir-
tual keyboard, so it can correct typing mistakes on the fly and take a stab 
at predicting what you’re about to type next. The keyboard isn’t exactly 
Nostradamus, but it does a pretty good job in coming up with the words you 
have in mind.
As you press your finger against a letter or number on the screen, the indi-
vidual key you press gets bigger and practically jumps off the screen, as 
shown in Figure 2-2. That way, you know that you struck the correct letter or 
number.
 
Sending a message to an overseas pal? Keep your finger pressed against 
a letter, and a row of keys showing variations on the character for foreign 
alphabets pops up, as shown in Figure 2-3. This lets you add the appropri-
ate accent mark. Just slide your finger until the key with the relevant accent 
mark is pressed.
Meanwhile, if you press and hold the .com key in Safari, it offers you the 
choice of .com, .net, .edu or .org. Pretty slick stuff.
Fingers or thumbs?
There is one last thing: Should you use your fin-
gers or thumbs to type? The answer is: both. It 
seems somewhat easier to hold the iPhone in 
your non-dominant hand (that is, your left hand 
if you’re right-handed or vice versa) and type 
with the index finger of your dominant hand, 
especially when you’re first starting out with 
the iPhone. And that’s what we suggest you try 
first.
Later, when you get the hang of typing with one 
index finger, you can try to speed things up by 
using both hands. There are two possible ways 
you can do that:
 ✓ Set the iPhone on a sturdy surface (such 
as a desk or table) and tap with both index 
fingers. Some users prefer this technique. 
But you can’t easily use it when you’re 
standing up with no sturdy surface of the 
proper height available.
 ✓ Cup the iPhone with both hands and type 
with both thumbs. This technique has the 
advantage of being possible in almost any 
situation with or without a sturdy surface. 
The downside is that your thumbs are bigger 
than your fingers so it takes more practice 
to type accurately with them — and if you 
have larger than average thumbs, well, 
you’re flirting with trouble.
Which is better? Don’t ask us — try it both ways 
and use the method that feels the most com-
fortable or lets you type with the best accuracy. 
Better still, master both techniques and use 
whichever is more appropriate at the time.

29
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
 
 
 
Figure 2-2: The ABCs of virtual typing. 
Figure 2-3: Accenting your letters.
Alas, mistakes are common at first. Say that you meant to type a sentence in 
the Notes application that reads, “I am typing a bunch of notes.” But because 
of the way your fingers struck the virtual keys, you actually entered “I am 
typing a bunch of npyrs.” Fortunately, Apple knows that the o you meant to 
press is next to the p that showed up on the keyboard, just as t and y and the 
e and the r are side by side. So the software determines that notes was indeed 
the word you had in mind and places it in red under the suspect word, as 
shown in Figure 2-4. To accept the suggested word, merely tap the Space key. 
And if for some reason you actually did mean to type npyrs instead, tap on 
the suggested word (notes in this example) to decline it.
 
Because Apple knows what you’re up to, the virtual keyboard is fine-tuned 
for the task at hand. If you’re entering a Web address, the keyboard inside 
the Safari Web browser (Chapter 10) includes dedicated period, forward 
slash, and .com keys but no Space key. If you’re using the Notes application 
(Chapter 5), the keyboard does have a Space key. And if you’re composing an 
e-mail message, a dedicated @ key pops up on the keyboard.
 
When you’re typing notes or sending e-mail and want to type a number, 
symbol, or punctuation mark, tap the 123 key to bring up an alternative vir-
tual keyboard. Tap the ABC key to return to the first keyboard. It’s not hard 
to get used to, but some may find this extra step irritating.

30
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
See Chapter 18 for a slick trick (the slide) that avoids the extra step involved 
in moving between the 123 and ABC keys.
As part of the 3.0 software upgrade, you can now rotate the iPhone so that its 
keyboard changes to a wider landscape mode in certain applications, specifi-
cally Mail, Messages, and Notes. The feature was already present in Safari. 
Since the keys are slightly larger in landscape mode, this is a potential boon 
to those of you who do a lot of typing or have largish fingers.
Editing mistakes
It’s a good idea to type with abandon and not get hung up over mistyped 
characters. The self-correcting keyboard will fix many errors. That said, 
plenty of typos will likely turn up, especially in the beginning, and you’ll have 
to make corrections manually.
 
A neat trick for doing so is to hold your finger against the screen to bring up 
the magnifying glass shown in Figure 2-5. Use it to position the pointer to the 
spot where you need to make the correction.

 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
Cut, Copy, and Paste
Being able to copy and paste text (or images) from one place on a computer 
to another has seemingly been a divine right since Moses, but getting to this 
Promised Land on the iPhone has taken awhile. Apple added Copy and Paste 
(and Cut) as part of OS 3.0. In its own inimitable way, Apple brought pizzazz 
to this long-requested feature.
On the iPhone, you might copy text or images from the Web, and paste them 
into an e-mail, text, a message, or a note. Or you might copy a bunch of pic-
tures or video into an e-mail.
Here’s how to exploit the feature. Say you’re jotting down ideas in the Notes 
application that you’ll eventually copy into an e-mail. Double-tap a word to 
select it, as shown in Figure 2-6, then drag the blue grab points or handles to 
select a larger block of text or to contract the text you’ve already selected. 
After you’ve selected the text, tap Copy. (If you want to delete the text block, 
tap Cut instead).
Now open the Mail program (Chapter 11) and start composing a message. 
When you decide where to insert the text you just copied, tap the cursor. Up 
pops commands to Select, Select All, and Paste, as shown in Figure 2-7. Tap 
Paste to paste the text into the message.

32
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Here’s the pizzazz part. If you made a mistake when you were cutting, past-
ing, or typing, shake the iPhone. It undoes the last edit.
Voice Control
Several cell phones of recent vintage let you dial a name or number by 
voice. Bark out “Call Mom” or “Dial 212-555-1212” and such handsets oblige. 
Although some third-party applications added voice dialing to the iPhone, 
Apple got around to it only as part of OS 3.0.
As you’ll see in Chapter 7, Apple took voice controls a step beyond dialing 
by number or finding people in your address book. You can also issue voice 
commands to control music in the iPod.
You have two ways to summon Voice Control:
 
✓ Press and hold the Home button until the Voice Control screen shown in 
Figure 2-8 appears. It has wavy lines that move as you speak. Scrolling in 
the background are some of the commands you can say out loud (“Play 
Artist,” “Previous Track,” and so on). Don’t blurt out anything until you 
hear a quick double-beep. The iPhone will repeat the command it thinks 
it heard.
 
✓ Press and hold the Center button on the wired headset. Once again, wait 
for an audible cue and then tell the iPhone what you have in mind.
While Voice Control works quite nicely with the wired headset that’s 
included with your iPhone, it does not work with a Bluetooth headset. In 
other words, if you use a wireless headset you’ll have to hold the phone up to 
your lips if you want it to respond to voice commands.
 
You definitely want to wait for the voice confirmation after you’ve spoken. In 
our experience, Voice Control isn’t perfect, especially in a noisy environment. 
So if you’re dialing a name or number, make sure the iPhone is indeed calling 
the person you had in mind. There’s no telling what kind of trouble you might 
get into otherwise.
Search
Using the Safari browser (Chapter 10), you can search the Web via Google or 
Yahoo!. But yet another new feature that arrived with OS 3.0 lets you search 
for people and programs across your iPhone or within specific applications. 
We show you how to search within apps in the various chapters dedicated to 
Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes, and iPod.

33
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
Searching across the iPhone, meanwhile, is based on the Spotlight feature 
familiar to Mac owners. To access Spotlight, flick to the left of the main Home 
screen (or as mentioned earlier in this chapter, press the Home button from 
the Home screen).
In the bar at the top of the screen that slides into view, enter your search 
query using the virtual keyboard. The iPhone starts spitting out results the 
moment you type a single character, and the list gets narrowed as you type 
additional characters.
The results are pretty darn thorough. Say you entered “Bell” as your search 
term, as shown in Figure 2-9. Contacts whose names have Bell in them will

library has the song “One Last Bell to Answer” or music performed by violin-
ist Joshua Bell, those will show up, too. Same goes for a third-party iPhone 
app called The Bell.

The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff 
to and from Your iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Starting your first sync
▶ Disconnecting during a sync
▶ Synchronizing contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks
▶ Synchronizing ringtones, music, podcasts, video, photos, and applications
A
fter you have passed basic training (in Chapter 2), the next thing you’re 
likely to want to do is get some or all of your contacts, appointments, 
events, mail settings, bookmarks, ringtones, music, movies, TV shows, 
podcasts, photos, and applications into your iPhone.
We have good news and . . . more good news. The good 
news is that you can easily copy any or all of those 
items from your computer to your iPhone. And the 
more good news is that after you do that, you can 
synchronize your contacts, appointments, and 
events so they’re kept up-to-date automatically 
in both places — on your computer and your 
iPhone — whenever you make a change in one 
place or the other. So when you add or change an 
appointment, an event, or a contact on your iPhone, 
that information automatically appears on your 
computer the next time your iPhone and computer 
communicate.
This communication between your iPhone and computer is 
called syncing (short for synchronizing). Don’t worry: It’s easy, and 
we’re going to walk you through the entire process in his chapter.

36
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
But wait. There’s even more good news. Items you manage on your com-
puter, such as music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, photos, and e-mail 
account settings, are synchronized only one way: from your computer to 
your iPhone, which is the way it should be.
Starting to Sync
Synchronizing your iPhone with your computer is a lot like syncing an iPod 
with your computer. If you’re an iPod user, the process will be a piece of 
cake. But it’s not too difficult even for those who’ve never used an iPod or 
iTunes:
 
1. Start by connecting your iPhone to your computer with the USB cable 
that came with your iPhone.
 
 When you connect your iPhone to your computer, iTunes should launch 
automatically. If it doesn’t, chances are you plugged the cable into a USB 
port on your keyboard, monitor, or hub. Try plugging it into one of the 
USB ports on your computer instead. Why? Because USB ports on your 
computer supply more power to a connected device than USB ports on a 
keyboard, monitor, or most hubs.
 
 If iTunes still doesn’t launch automatically, try launching it manually.
 
 One last thing: If you’ve taken any photos with your iPhone since the 
last time you synced it, your photo management software (iPhoto on the 
Mac; Adobe Photoshop Album or Elements on the PC) will launch and 
ask whether you want to import the photos from your phone. (You find 
out all about this later in the chapter.)
 
2. Select your iPhone in the iTunes source list.
 
 You see the Set Up Your iPhone pane, as shown in Figure 3-1. If you’ve 
already set up and named your iPhone, you can skip Steps 3 and 4a and 
start with Step 4b.
 
 If you don’t see an iPhone in the source list, and you’re sure it’s con-
nected to a USB port on your computer (not the keyboard, monitor, or 
hub), restart your computer.
 
3. Name your iPhone.
 
 We’ve named this one BobLeViPhone.
 
4a. Decide whether you want iTunes to automatically synchronize your 
iPhone and your contacts, calendars, bookmarks, notes, e-mail 
accounts, and applications.

37
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
 
iPhone selected in source list
 
Figure 3-1: This is the first thing you see in iTunes.
 
• If that’s what you want, click the check box next to the option 
titled Automatically Sync Contacts, Calendars, Bookmarks, 
Notes, and Email Accounts to make a check mark appear and 
click the check box next to the option titled Automatically Sync 
Applications. Then click the Done button and continue with the 
“Synchronizing Your Media” section later in this chapter.
 
• If you want to synchronize manually, make sure both check 
boxes are unchecked, as shown in Figure 3-1, and click Done. 
The “Synchronizing Your Data” section tells you all about how 
to configure your contacts, calendars, bookmarks, notes, e-mail 
accounts, and applications manually.
 
 We’ve chosen to not select either check box so we can show you how to 
manually set up each type of sync in the upcoming sections.
 
4b. After you click the Done button (applies only to those who just 
performed Steps 3 and 4a), the Summary pane should appear. If it 
doesn’t, make sure your iPhone is still selected in the source list and 
click the Summary tab near the top of the window, as shown in 
Figure 3-2.
 
5. If you want iTunes to sync your iPhone automatically whenever 
you connect it to your computer, click to put a check mark in the 
Automatically Sync When This iPhone Is Connected check box 
(in the Options area).

38
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
Summary tab
 
Figure 3-2: The Summary pane is pretty painless.
 
 Don’t select this check box if you want to sync manually by clicking the 
Sync button at the bottom of the window.
 
 Your choice in Step 5 is not set in stone. If you select the Automatically 
Sync When This iPhone Is Connected check box, you can still prevent 
your iPhone from syncing automatically in several ways:
 
• Way #1: After you connect the iPhone to your computer, click the 
Summary tab in iTunes and uncheck the Automatically Sync When 
This iPhone Is Connected check box. This prevents iTunes from 
opening automatically when you connect the iPhone. If you use 
this method, you can still start a sync manually.
 
• Way #2: Launch iTunes. Then before you connect your iPhone 
to your computer, press and hold Command+Option (Mac) or 
Shift+Ctrl (PC) until you see your iPhone in the iTunes source list. 
This method prevents your iPhone from syncing automatically just 
this one time, without changing any settings.
 
6. If you want to sync only items that have check marks to the left of 
their names in your iTunes library, select the Only Sync Checked 
Songs and Videos check box.

39
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
 
7. If you want to turn off automatic syncing in the Music and Video 
panes, select the Manually Manage Music and Videos check box.
 
8. If you want to password-protect your iPhone backups (your iPhone 
creates a backup of its contents automatically every time you sync), 
select the Encrypt iPhone Backup check box.
And, of course, if you decide to uncheck the Automatically Sync When This 
iPhone Is Connected check box, you can always synchronize manually by 
clicking the Sync button in the bottom-right corner of the window.
By the way, if you’ve changed any sync settings since the last time you syn-
chronized, the Sync button will instead say Apply.
Disconnecting the iPhone
When the iPhone is syncing with your computer, its screen says Sync in 
Progress and iTunes displays a message that says that it’s syncing with your 
iPhone. After the sync is finished, iTunes displays a message that the iPhone 
sync is complete and it’s okay to disconnect your iPhone.
 
If you disconnect your iPhone before a sync is completed, all or part of the 
sync may fail.
To cancel a sync so that you can safely disconnect your iPhone, drag the 
slider on the iPhone (the one that says Slide to Cancel) during the sync.
If you get a call while you’re syncing, the sync is safely cancelled so that you 
can safely disconnect your iPhone and answer the call. After you’re finished 
with the call, just reconnect your iPhone to restart the sync.
Synchronizing Your Data
Did you choose to set up data synchronization manually by not selecting 
the Automatically Sync Contacts, Calendars, Bookmarks, Notes, and Email 
Accounts check box or the Automatically Sync Applications check box in the 
Set Up Your iPhone pane shown in Figure 3-1? If you did, your next order of 
business is to tell iTunes what data you want to synchronize between your 
iPhone and your computer. You do this by clicking the Info tab, which is to 
the right of the Summary tab.
The Info pane has seven sections: MobileMe, Contacts, Calendars, Web 
Browser, Notes, Mail Accounts, and Advanced. The following sections look at 
them one by one.

40
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
MobileMe
MobileMe is Apple’s $99-a-year service for keeping your iPhone, iPod Touch, 
Macs, and PCs synchronized. It is the latest iteration of what Apple used to 
call .Mac (pronounced “dotMac”). The big allure of MobileMe is that it can 
“push” information such as e-mail, calendars, contacts, and bookmarks from 
your computer to and from your iPhone and keep those items synchronized 
on your iPhone and computer(s) wirelessly and without human intervention.
If you want to have your e-mail, calendars, contacts, and bookmarks syn-
chronized automatically and wirelessly, click the Set Up Now button. Your 
Web browser launches and instructions appear for subscribing to MobileMe 
if you’re not already a subscriber or for setting up each of your devices for 
MobileMe if you are already a subscriber.
If you’re going to use MobileMe to sync your e-mail, calendars, contacts, and 
bookmarks, you can safely ignore the information in four of the next six sec-
tions: “Contacts,” “Calendars,” “Web browser,” and “Advanced.” Those four 
sections deal with using iTunes for synchronization, and you won’t need 
them if you’re using MobileMe. The fifth and sixth sections, “Mail accounts” 
and “Notes,” both contain information even MobileMe users may find useful.
Contacts
The Contacts section of the Info pane determines how synchronization is 
handled for your contacts. One method is to synchronize all your contacts, 
as shown in Figure 3-3. Or you can synchronize any or all groups of contacts 
you’ve created in your computer’s address book program; just select the 
appropriate check boxes in the Selected Groups list, and only those groups 
will be synchronized.
 
 
Figure 3-3: Want to synchronize your contacts? This is where you 
 
set things up.

41
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
The iPhone syncs with the following address book programs:
 
✓ Mac: Address Book and other address books that sync with Address 
Book, such as Microsoft Entourage
 
✓ PC: Windows Address Book (Outlook Express) and Microsoft Outlook
 
✓ Mac and PC: Yahoo! Address Book and Google Contacts
On a Mac, you can sync contacts with multiple applications. On a PC, you can 
sync contacts with only one application at a time.
If you use Yahoo! Address Book, select the Sync Yahoo! Address Book 
Contacts check box, and then click the Configure button to enter your Yahoo! 
ID and password. If you use Google Contacts, select the Sync Google Contacts 
check box, and then click the Configure button to enter your Google ID and 
password.
Syncing will never delete a contact from your Yahoo! Address Book if it has 
a Messenger ID, even if you delete that contact on the iPhone or on your 
computer.
 
To delete a contact that has a Messenger ID, log in to your Yahoo! account 
with a Web browser and delete the contact in your Yahoo! Address Book.
 
If you sync with your employer’s Microsoft Exchange calendar and contacts, 
all your personal contacts and calendars will be wiped out.
Calendars
The Calendars section of the Info pane determines how synchronization is 
handled for your appointments and events. You can synchronize all your cal-
endars, as shown in Figure 3-4. Or you can synchronize any or all individual 
calendars you’ve created in your computer’s calendar program. Just select 
the appropriate check boxes.
 
 
Figure 3-4: Set up sync for your calendar events here.

42
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
The iPhone syncs with the following calendar programs:
 
✓ Mac: iCal, plus any tasks or events that currently sync with iCal on your 
Mac, such as events and tasks in Microsoft Entourage
 
✓ PC: Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007
On a Mac, you can sync calendars with multiple applications. On a PC, you 
can sync calendars with only one application at a time.
 
One cool thing about syncing your calendar is that if you create reminders, 
alerts, or alarms in your computer’s calendar program, they appear (and 
sound) on your iPhone at the appropriate date and time.
Web browser
The Web Browser section of the Info pane has but a single check box, which 
asks if you want to sync your bookmarks. Select it if you do; don’t select it if 
you don’t.
The iPhone syncs bookmarks with the following Web browsers:
 
✓ Mac: Safari
 
✓ PC: Microsoft Internet Explorer and Safari
Notes
The Notes section of the Info pane also has only one check box: Sync Notes. 
Select it to sync notes in the Notes application on your iPhone with notes in 
Apple Mail on a Mac or Microsoft Outlook on a PC.
Note that on a Mac you must have Mac OS X 10.5.7 or later installed to sync 
notes.
Mail accounts
You can sync account settings for your e-mail accounts in the Mail Accounts 
section of the Info pane. You can synchronize all your e-mail accounts (if you 
have more than one), or you can synchronize individual accounts, as shown 
in Figure 3-5. Just select the appropriate check boxes.
The iPhone syncs with the following mail programs:
 
✓ Mac: Mail and Microsoft Entourage
 
✓ PC: Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007 and Microsoft Outlook Express

43
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
 
 
Figure 3-5: Transfer e-mail account settings to your iPhone here.
 
E-mail account settings are synchronized only one way: from your computer 
to your iPhone. If you make changes to any e-mail account settings on your 
iPhone, the changes will not be synchronized back to the e-mail account on 
your computer. Trust us, this is a very good feature and we’re glad Apple did 
it this way.
By the way, the password for your e-mail account may or may not be saved 
on your computer. If you sync an e-mail account and the iPhone asks for a 
password when you send or receive mail, do this: Tap Settings on the Home 
screen, tap Mail, tap your e-mail account’s name, and then type your pass-
word in the appropriate field.
Advanced
Every so often the contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks on 
your iPhone get so screwed up that the easiest way to fix things is to erase 
that information on your iPhone and replace it with information from your 
computer.
If that’s the case, just click to select the appropriate check boxes, as shown 
in Figure 3-6. Then the next time you sync, that information on your iPhone 
will be replaced with information from your computer.
 
 
Figure 3-6: Replace the information on your iPhone with the information 
 
on your computer.

44
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
Because the Advanced section is at the bottom of the Info pane and you have 
to scroll down to see it, it’s easy to forget that it’s there. Although you prob-
ably won’t need to use this feature very often (if ever), you’ll be happy you 
remembered that it’s there if you do need it.
Synchronizing Your Media
If you chose to let iTunes manage synchronizing your data automatically, wel-
come back. This section looks at how you get your media — your ringtones, 
music, podcasts, video, and photos — from your computer to your iPhone.
 
Ringtones, music, podcasts, and video (but not photos) are synced only 
one way: from your computer to your iPhone. Deleting any of these items 
from your iPhone does not delete them from your computer when you sync. 
The only exceptions are songs, ringtones, podcasts, video, and applications 
that you purchase or download with the iTunes or App Store apps on your 
iPhone. Such items are, as you’d expect, copied to your computer automati-
cally when you sync.
Ringtones, music, podcasts, and video
You use the Ringtones, Music, Podcasts, and Video panes to specify the 
media that you want to copy from your computer to your iPhone. To view 
any of these panes, make sure that your iPhone is still selected in the source 
list, and then click the Music, Podcasts, or Video tab near the top of the 
window.
Ringtones
If you have any custom ringtones in your iTunes library, select the Sync 
Ringtones check box in the Ringtones pane. Then you can choose either all 
ringtones or choose individual ringtones by selecting their check boxes.
Music, music videos, and voice memos
To transfer music to your iPhone, select the Sync Music check box in the 
Music pane. You can then select the button for All Songs and Playlists or 
Selected Playlists. If you choose the latter, click the check boxes next to par-
ticular playlists you want to transfer. You also can choose to include music 
videos or voice memos or both by selecting the appropriate check boxes at 
the bottom of the pane (see Figure 3-7).
 
If you choose All Songs and Playlists and have more songs in your iTunes 
library than storage space on your iPhone — more than about 7GB on an 8GB 
iPhone and 14.5GB on a 16GB iPhone — you’ll see one or both of the error 
messages shown in Figure 3-8 when you try to sync.

45
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
 
 
Figure 3-7: Use the Music pane to copy music, music videos, and voice 
 
notes from your computer to your iPhone.
 
 
Figure 3-8: If you have more music than your iPhone has 
 
room for, this is what you’ll see when you sync.
To avoid these errors, select playlists that total less than 7, 15, or 31 
gigabytes.
 
Music, podcasts, and video are notorious for chewing up massive amounts of 
storage space on your iPhone. If you try to sync too much media, you’ll see 
lots of error messages like the ones in Figure 3-8. Forewarned is forearmed.

46
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Podcasts
To transfer podcasts to your iPhone, select the Sync check box in the 
Podcasts pane. Then you can choose All Podcasts or Selected Podcasts, as 
shown in Figure 3-9.
 
 
Figure 3-9: The Podcasts pane determines which podcasts are copied 
 
to your iPhone.
Regardless of whether you choose to sync all podcasts or only selected pod-
casts, a pop-up menu allows you to specify which episodes you want to sync, 
as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
 
Figure 3-10: This menu determines how podcasts are synced with 
 
your iPhone.

47
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
Video
To transfer rented movies, TV shows, and movies to your iPhone, select the 
appropriate check boxes in the Video pane, as shown in Figure 3-11.
 
 
Figure 3-11: Your choices in the Video pane determine which rented 
 
movies, TV shows, and movies are copied to your iPhone.
The procedure for syncing TV shows is slightly different from the procedure 
for syncing movies. First, select the Sync check box to enable TV show sync-
ing. Then choose either All TV Shows or Selected. If you go with Selected, 
you can then choose between TV Shows and Playlists from the pop-up menu 
(which says TV Shows in Figure 3-11).
Next, choose how many episodes you want to sync from the pop-up menu 
shown in Figure 3-12 (we’ve selected 3 Most Recent Unwatched).
To sync rented movies or movies you own, first select the Sync Rented 
Movies or Sync Movies check box, and then select the check boxes of the 
individual movies you want to sync.

48
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
 
Figure 3-12: This menu determines how TV shows are synced with 
 
your iPhone.
 
We don’t have any rented movies in our iTunes library, so there’s nothing to 
select in the Rented Movies section in Figure 3-11 or Figure 3-12. Rest assured 
that if we did have rented movies, they would definitely appear right there in 
the Rented Movies section.
Photos
Syncing photos is a little different from syncing other media because your 
iPhone has a built-in camera and you may want to copy pictures you take 
with the iPhone to your computer, as well as copy pictures stored on your 
computer to your iPhone.
The iPhone syncs photos with the following programs:
 
✓ Mac: iPhoto version 4.03 or later, or Aperture
 
✓ PC: Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 or later and Adobe Photoshop 
Elements 3.0 or later
You can also sync photos with any folder on your computer that contains 
images.
To sync photos, click the Photos tab at the top of the window. In the Photos 
pane, select the Sync Photos From check box, and then choose an applica-
tion or folder from the pop-up menu (which says iPhoto in Figure 3-13).

49
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone 
 
 
Figure 3-13: The Photos pane determines which photos will be 
 
synchronized with your iPhone.
If you choose an application that supports photo albums, as in Figure 3-13 by 
choosing iPhoto, you can then select specific albums to sync. If you choose 
a folder full of images, you can create subfolders inside it that will appear as 
albums on your iPhone. But if you choose an application that doesn’t support 
albums, or a single folder full of images with no subfolders, you have to trans-
fer all or nothing.
Because we selected iPhoto in the Sync Photos From menu, and iPhoto ’09 
(the version installed on our Mac) supports events in addition to albums, we 
have the option of syncing events instead of albums if we prefer.
 
If you have lots of albums or events, you can rearrange the list so that the 
ones you expect to check or uncheck most often are near the top. Simply 
click an album or event name and drag it up or down in the list.
If you’ve taken any photos with your iPhone since the last time you synced 
it, the appropriate program launches (or the appropriate folder is selected), 
and you have the option of downloading the pictures to your computer. 
The process is the same as when you download pictures from your digital 
camera.
Applications
If you have downloaded or purchased any iPhone applications from the 
iTunes App Store, click the Applications tab, and then select the Sync 
Applications check box. Then you can choose either all applications or indi-
vidual applications by selecting their check boxes.

50
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
How much space did I use?
If you’re interested in knowing how much free space is available on your 
iPhone, look near the bottom of the iTunes window while your iPhone is 
selected in the source list. You’ll see a chart that shows the contents of your 
iPhone, color-coded for your convenience. As you can see in Figure 3-14, this 
32GB iPhone 3GS has 4.11GB of free space.
 
 
Figure 3-14: This handy chart shows you how much space is being 
 
used on your iPhone.
 
Here’s a cool trick: Click directly on the chart and watch the units of measure 
switch from gigabytes/megabytes to songs/items/photos and days/hours.
 
In case you’re wondering, Other is the catchall category for contacts, cal-
endars, appointments, events, bookmarks, notes, and e-mail stored on your 
phone. In our case, the total of these items is a mere 1.08GB, a tiny fraction of 
the total storage space available on this iPhone.

Part II
The Mobile iPhone

Your iPhone is ﬁ rst and foremost a mobile 
phone, so in this part we explore how to use 
typical mobile phone features, starting with all the 
neat ways to make an outgoing phone call. You 
also ﬁ nd out how to answer or ignore the calls 
that come in and discover iPhone’s clever visual 
voicemail feature, which lets you take in messages 
on your terms, rather than in the order in which 
the messages arrived on the phone. You also 
ﬁ gure out how to juggle calls, merge calls, and 
decide on a ringtone. And, if you’re lucky enough 
to own an iPhone 3G S, you see how easy it is to 
make calls with Voice Control.
After you master all the calling and listening stuff, 
you’re ready to become a whiz at sending and 
retrieving SMS and MMS messages. As journalists, 
we especially appreciate what comes next: ﬁ nding 
out how to become a champion note-taker.
We close this part by investigating all those 
C-word programs — namely, Calendar, Calculator, 
and Clock — plus the new (in iPhone OS 3.0) 
V-word program called Voice Memos. These 
handy applications enable you to record memos 
(or lectures, or anything you can hear, really), 
solve arithmetic problems on the ﬂ y (with one or 
two nifty calculators), and help you stay on top of 
your appointments. And — thanks to a built-in 
alarm clock — you may actually show up for 
those appointments on time.

Understanding the
Phone-damentals
In This Chapter
▶ Making a call
▶ Visualizing visual voicemail
▶ Recording a greeting
▶ Calling hands-free
▶ Receiving a call
▶ Choosing ringtones
▶ Setting up conference calls
You may well have bought an iPhone for its spectacular 
photo viewer, marvelous widescreen iPod, and the 
best darn pocket-sized Internet browser you’ve ever 
come across. Not to mention its overall coolness.
For most of us, though, cool goes only so far. The 
iPhone’s most critical mission is the one from 
which its name is derived — it is first and foremost 
a cell phone. And no matter how capable it is at all 
those other things, when push comes to shove you 
had best be able to make and receive phone calls.
That puts a lot of responsibility in the hands of AT&T, 
the iPhone’s exclusive wireless carrier in the United 
States. As with any cell phone, the strength of the wireless 
signal depends a great deal on your location and the robust-
ness of the carrier’s network.

54
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
As noted in Chapter 1, the cell-signal status icon at the upper-left corner of 
the screen can clue you in on what your phone-calling experience may be 
like. Simply put, more bars supposedly equates to a better experience. What 
you hope to avoid are those two dreaded words: No Service. Cell coverage 
aside, this chapter is devoted to all the nifty ways you can handle wireless 
calls on an iPhone.
Somewhere, Alexander Graham Bell is beaming.
Making a Call
Start by tapping the Phone icon on the Home screen. You can then make 
calls by tapping on any of the icons that show up at the bottom of the screen: 
Contacts, Favorites, Recents, Keypad, or Voicemail. Depending on the cir-
cumstances, one of these could be the most appropriate method. The iPhone 
3GS has one more way: You can dial a name or phone number by voice. Let’s 
take these options one by one.
Contacts
If you read the chapter on syncing (Chapter 3), you know how to get the 
snail-mail addresses, e-mail addresses, and (most relevant for this chapter) 
phone numbers that reside on your PC or Mac into the iPhone. Assuming that 
you went through that drill already, all those addresses and phone numbers 
are hanging out in one place. Their not-so-secret hiding place is revealed 
when you tap the Contacts icon in the Phone application or the Contacts icon 
on one of the Home screen pages.
Here’s how to make those contacts work to your benefit:
 
1. In the Phone application, tap Contacts.
 
2. Flick your finger so the list of contacts on the screen scrolls rapidly up 
or down, loosely reminiscent of the spinning Lucky 7s (or other pic-
tures) on a Las Vegas slot machine.
 
 Think of the payout you’d get with that kind of power on a One-Armed 
Bandit.
 
 Alternatively, you can move your fingers along the alphabet on the right 
edge of the Contacts list or tap one of the teeny-tiny letters to jump to 
names that begin with that letter.
 
 You can find a list of potential matches also by starting to type the name 
of a contact in the search field near the top of the list. Or type the name 
of the place your contact works. You may have to flick to get the search 
field into view. With the 3.0 software upgrade, you can find people using 
Spotlight search (refer to Chapter 2.)

55
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
3. When you’re at or near the appropriate contact name, stop the scroll-
ing by tapping the screen.
 
 Note that when you tap to stop the scrolling, that tap doesn’t select an 
item in the list. This may seem counterintuitive the first few times you 
try it, but we got used to it and now we really like it this way.
 
 Tap the status bar to automatically scroll to the top of the list. This is 
useful if you’re really popular (or influential) and have a whole bunch 
of names among your contacts. Or tap the tiny magnifying glass on the 
upper right to get to the top of the list.
 
4. Tap the name of the person you want to call.
 
 As shown in Figure 4-1, you can see a bunch of fields with the individu-
al’s phone numbers, physical and e-mail addresses, and possibly even a 
mug shot.
 
 Odds are pretty good that the person has more than one phone number, 
so the hardest decision you must make is choosing which of these num-
bers to call.
 
5. Tap the phone number, and the iPhone initiates the call.
If you lumped your contacts into Groups on your computer, reflecting, say, 
different departments in your company, friends from work, friends from 
school, and so on, you can tap the Groups button on the upper-left side of the 
All Contacts screen to access these groups.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
Your own iPhone phone number, lest you forget it, appears at the top of the 
Contacts list, provided you arrived in Contacts through the Phone application.
You can also initiate text messages and e-mails from within Contacts. Those 
topics are discussed in greater depth in Chapters 5 and 11, respectively.
Favorites
Consider Favorites the iPhone equivalent of speed-dialing. It’s where you can 
keep a list of the people and numbers you dial most often. Merely tap the per-
son’s name in Favorites, and your iPhone calls the person.
 
You can set up as many favorites as you need for a person. So, for example, 
you may create separate Favorites listings for your spouse’s office phone 
number and cell number.
Setting up Favorites is a breeze. When looking at one of your contacts, you 
may have noticed the Add to Favorites button. When you tap this button, all 
the phone numbers you have for that person pop up. Tap the number you 
want to make into a favorite and it turns up on the list.
 
You can rearrange the order in which your favorites are displayed. Tap Edit, 
and then, to the right of the person you want to move, press your finger 
against the symbol that looks like three short horizontal lines stacked on top 
of one another. Drag that symbol to the place on the list where you want your 
favorite contact to appear.
You can designate new favorites from the Favorites application by tapping 
the + symbol at the upper-right corner of the screen. Doing so brings you 
back to Contacts. From there, choose the appropriate person and number. A 
star appears next to any contact’s number chosen as a favorite.
If any of your chosen folks happen to fall out of favor, you can easily kick 
them off the Favorites roster. Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
 
 You’ll notice that a red circle with a horizontal white line appears to the 
left of each name in the list.
 
2. Tap the circle next to the A-lister getting the heave-ho.
 
 The horizontal white line is now vertical and a red Delete button 
appears to the right of the name, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
3. Tap Delete.
 
 The person (or one of his or her given phone numbers) is no longer 
afforded the privilege of being in your iPhone inner circle.

57
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
 
Figure 4-2: I don’t like you as much anymore.
 
Booting someone off the Favorites list does not remove that person from the 
main Contacts list.
Recents
Tapping the Recents icon displays the iPhone call log. The Recents feature 
houses logs of all the, well, recent calls made or received, as well as calls 
you missed. Here’s a tricky concept: Tap All to show all the recent calls and 
Missed to show just those you missed. Under the All list, completed calls and 
missed calls that have been returned by clicking the red entry are shown in 
black, and missed calls that haven’t been returned in this fashion are in red, 
along with a descriptor of the phone you were calling or received a call from 
(home, mobile, and so on).
By tapping the small blue circle with the right-pointing arrow next to an item 
in the list, you can find out the time the call was made or missed, as well as 
any known info about the caller from your Contacts information.
To return a call, just tap anywhere on the name.
 
If one of the calls you missed came from someone who isn’t already in your 
Contacts, you can add him or her. Tap the right-pointing arrow, and then tap 
the Create New Contact button. If the person is among your Contacts but has 
a new number, tap the Add to Existing Contact button. When the list gets too 
long, tap Clear to clean it up.

58
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Keypad
From time to time, of course, you have to dial the number of a person or com-
pany who hasn’t earned a spot in your Contacts.
That’s when you’ll want to tap the Keypad icon to bring up the large keys of 
the virtual touchtone keypad you see in Figure 4-3. Despite what you may 
have read elsewhere, we find it surprisingly simple to manually dial a number 
on this keypad. Just tap the appropriate keys and tap Call.
 
To add this number to your address book, tap the + key (it’s the one with the 
silhouette of a person) on the keypad and click either Create New Contact or 
Add to Existing Contact.
You can use the iPhone’s keypad also to remotely check your voicemail at 
work or home.
Come to think of it, what a perfect segue into the next section. It’s on one of 
our favorite iPhone features, visual voicemail.
Visual voicemail
How often have you had to listen to four or five (or more) voicemail mes-
sages before getting to the message you really want, or need, to hear? As 
shown in Figure 4-4, the iPhone’s clever visual voicemail presents a list of 
your voicemail messages in the order in which calls were received. But you 
need not listen to those messages in order.
How do you even know you have voicemail? There are a few ways:
 
✓ A red circle showing the number of pending messages awaiting your 
attention appears above the Phone icon on the Home screen or above 
the Voicemail icon from within the Phone application.
 
✓ You may also see a message on the iPhone display that says something 
like, “New voicemail from Ed (or Bob).”
Whatever draws you in, tap that Voicemail icon to display the list of voice-
mails. You see the caller’s phone number, assuming this info is known 
through CallerID, and in some cases, his or her name. Or you see the word 
Unknown.
The beauty of all this, of course, is that you can ignore (or at least put off lis-
tening to) certain messages. We are not in the advice-giving business on what 
calls you can safely avoid; if you disregard messages from the IRS or your 
parole officer, it’s at your own risk, okay?

to dial.
A blue dot next to a name or number signifies that you haven’t heard the 
message yet.
To play back a voicemail, tap the name or number in question. Then tap the 
tiny Play/Pause button that shows up to the left. Tap once more to pause the 
message; tap again to resume. Tap the Speaker button if you want to hear the 
message through the iPhone’s speakerphone.
 
Tap the blue arrow next to a caller’s name or number to bring up any contact 
info on the person or to add the caller to your Contacts.
 
The tiny playhead along the Scrubber bar (refer to Figure 4-4) shows you the 
length of the message and how much of the message you’ve heard. If you 
hate when callers ramble on forever, you can drag the playhead to rapidly 
advance through a message. Perhaps more importantly, if you miss some-
thing, you can replay that segment.
Returning a call is as simple as tapping the green Call Back button. And you 
can delete a voicemail by pressing Delete.

60
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
If you have no phone service, you’ll see a message that says Visual Voicemail 
is currently unavailable.
 
You can listen to your iPhone voicemail from another phone. Just dial your 
iPhone number and, while the greeting plays, enter your voicemail password. 
You can set up such a password by tapping Settings from the Home screen, 
and then tapping Phone. Tap Change Voicemail Password. You’ll be asked to 
enter your current voicemail password, if you have one. If one doesn’t exist 
yet, tap Done. If it does exist, enter it and then tap Done. You’ll then be asked 
to type the new password and tap Done, twice.
Recording a greeting
You have two choices when it comes to the voicemail greeting your callers 
will hear. You can accept a generic greeting with your phone number by 
default. Or you can create a custom greeting in your own voice as follows:
 
1. In the voicemail application, tap the Greeting button.
 
2. Tap Custom.
 
3. Tap Record and start dictating a clever, deserving-of-being-on-the-
iPhone voicemail greeting.
The globetrotting iPhone
Apple has managed to cram ten radios into 
the latest iPhone. It has four GSM/Edge radios 
(850, 900, 1,800, 1,900 MHz), three UMTS/HSDPA 
radios, plus radios for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and 
GPS. And here’s a bit of trivia: The metal ring 
around the iPhone camera is part of the antenna 
design.
Before you break into a sweat over the termi-
nology, know that all we’re really talking about 
is a 3G, or third-generation, phone that you can 
use to make calls (and do more) while travel-
ing abroad. You’ll have to have AT&T turn on 
something called international roaming (unless, 
of course, you live in a foreign land and have a 
local carrier). Contact AT&T for the latest rates, 
which were fairly harsh at the time this book 
was being prepared. Go to www.wireless.
att.com/learn/international for 
details.
If you’re calling the U.S. while overseas, you 
can take advantage of International Assist. This 
feature automatically adds the proper prefix to 
U.S. numbers dialed from abroad. Tap Settings, 
Phone, and then International Assist. Make sure 
you see the blue On button instead of the white 
Off button.
Although iPhone started out as a U.S.-only 
proposition, Apple has now launched versions 
in more than 80 countries.

61
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
4. When you have finished recording, tap Stop.
 
5. Review the greeting by pressing Play.
 
6. If the greeting is worthy, tap Save. If not, tap Cancel and start over at 
Step 1.
Voice dialing
If you have a 3GS phone, you can make a call hands-free, just by opening your 
mouth.
To summon Voice Control (refer to Chapter 2, Figure 2-8), press and hold the 
Home button or press and hold the center button on the wired headset with 
the remote and microphone supplied with the iPhone.
Wait for the tone and speak clearly, especially if you’re in a noisy environ-
ment. You can dial by number, as in “Dial 202-555-1212.” You can dial a name, 
as in “Call Bob LeVitus” or “Dial Ed Baig.” Or you can be a tad more specific 
as in “Dial Bob LeVitus mobile” or “Call Ed Baig home.” Before actually dialing 
the phone, an automated female voice repeats what she thinks she heard.
If the person you’re calling has multiple phone numbers and you fail to spec-
ify which one, the female voice will prompt you, “Ed Baig, home, mobile, or 
work?” Tell her which one it is, or say “Cancel” if you decide not to call.
 
When the Voice Control screen appears, let go of the Home button before 
speaking a command. Otherwise, your thumb may cover the microphone, 
making it more difficult for the iPhone to understand your intent.
Receiving a Call
It’s wonderful to have numerous options for making a call. But what are your 
choices when somebody calls you? The answer depends on whether you are 
willing to take the call or not.
Accepting the call
To accept a call, you have three options:
 
✓ Tap Answer and greet the caller in whatever language makes sense.
 
✓ If the phone is locked, drag the slider to the right.
 
✓ If you are donning the stereo earbuds that come with the iPhone, click 
the microphone button. Microphone adapters for standard headsets 
may also work.

62
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
Actually, you have a fourth option if you wear a wireless Bluetooth headset 
or use a car speakerphone. Click the Answer button on your headset or 
speakerphone (refer to the manual if the process isn’t intuitive). For more on 
Bluetooth, read Chapter 13.
 
If you’re listening to music in your iPhone’s iPod when a call comes in, the 
song stops playing and you have to decide whether to take the call. If you do, 
the music resumes from where you left off after the conversation ends.
Rejecting the call
We’re going to assume that you’re not a cold-hearted person out to break a 
caller’s heart. Rather, we assume that you are a busy person who will call 
back at a more convenient time.
Keeping that positive spin in mind, here are three ways to reject a call on the 
spot and send the call to voicemail:
 
✓ Tap Decline. Couldn’t be easier than that.
 
✓ Press the Sleep/Wake button twice in rapid succession. (The button is 
on the top of the device.)
 
✓ Using the supplied headset, press and hold the Microphone button for a 
couple of seconds, and then let go. Two beeps let you know that the call 
was indeed rejected.
 
Sometimes you’re perfectly willing to take a call but you need to silence the 
ringer or turn off the vibration, lest the people sitting near you in the movie 
theater or corporate board room cast an evil eye your way. To do so, press 
the Sleep/Wake button a single time, or press one of the volume buttons. 
You’ll still have the opportunity to answer.
Choosing ringtones
At the time this book was written, Apple included 25 ringtones in the iPhone, 
ranging from the sound of crickets to an old car horn. Read the “iTunes and 
ringtones” sidebar to figure out how to create your own custom ringtones.
To choose a ringtone, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, tap Settings.
 
2. Tap Sounds.
 
3. Tap Ringtone to access the list of available ringtones, shown in 
Figure 4-5.

63
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
 
Figure 4-5: Ring my chimes: The 
 
iPhone’s ringtones.
 
4. Flick your finger to move up or down the list.
 
5. Tap any of the ringtones to hear what it will sound like.
 
 A check mark appears next to the ringtone you’ve just listened to. If 
need be, adjust the volume slider in Sounds.
 
6. If satisfied, you need do nothing more. Unbeknownst to you, you have 
just selected that ringtone. If you’re not pleased, try another.
 
You can easily assign specific ringtones to individual callers. From Contacts, 
choose the person to whom you want to designate a particular ringtone. Tap 
Edit, and then tap Assign Ringtone. This displays the aforementioned list of 
ringtones. Choose the one that seems most appropriate (a barking dog, say, 
for your father-in-law).
To change or delete the ringtone for a specific person, go back into Contacts, 
and then tap Edit. Either tap the right arrow to choose a new ringtone for 
that person or tap the red circle and Delete to remove the custom ringtone 
altogether.

64
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
While on a Call
You can do lots of things while talking on an iPhone, such as consulting your 
Calendar, taking notes, or checking the weather. Tap the Home button to get 
to these other applications. You’ve just witnessed the multitasking marvel 
that is the iPhone.
 
If you’re using Wi-Fi or 3G, you can also surf the Web (through Safari) while 
talking on the phone. But you can’t surf while you talk if your only outlet to 
cyberspace is the EDGE network.
Other options:
 
✓ Mute a call: From the main call screen (shown in Figure 4-6), tap Mute. 
Now you need not mutter under your breath when a caller ticks you off 
because the caller can’t hear you. Tap Mute again to un-mute the sound.
 
✓ Tap Contacts to display the Contacts list.
 
✓ Place a call on hold: Again, pretty self-explanatory. Just tap Hold. Tap 
Hold again to take the person off hold. You might put a caller on hold 
to answer another incoming call or to make a second call yourself. The 
next section shows you how to deal with more than one call at a time.
iTunes and ringtones
When Apple first launched iPhone in June 
2007, we were disappointed that we couldn’t 
use snippets of music from our iTunes library 
for ringtones. It took a few months, but iPhone 
owners can now turn some of the songs they’ve 
purchased (or will buy) into custom ringtones. 
You must fork over 99 cents for songs that are 
already in your iTunes library on your computer 
or pay $1.98 for a new song from the iTunes 
Store online (which lets you also get full use of 
the track on your PC or Mac.)
The ringtone-ready music in your own iTunes 
collection is designated by a little bell symbol. 
Clicking that symbol brings up a ringtone editor 
that resembles Apple’s GarageBand music editing 
software. Drag the editor over the portion of the 
song you want to use as your ringtone — up to 
30 seconds’ worth. You can choose to have the 
ringtone fade in or out by selecting the appropri-
ate boxes in the editor. Click Preview to make 
sure that you’re happy with the result, and click 
Buy when you’re satisfied.
Connect the iPhone to your computer to syn-
chronize the ringtone.
You can also create custom ringtones in 
GarageBand and through such third-party 
utilities as iToner. Head to Chapter 18 for more 
details on GarageBand ringtoning. (We love 
coining new verbs).

65
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
✓ Tap Keypad to bring back the keypad: This is useful if you have to type 
touchtones to access another voicemail system or respond to an auto-
mated menu system. Heaven forbid you actually get a live person when 
calling an insurance company or airline. But we digress. . . .
 
✓ Use the speakerphone: Tap Speaker to listen to a call through the 
iPhone’s internal speakers without having to hold the device up to your 
mouth.
 
✓ Make a conference call: Read on.
Juggling calls
You can field a new call when you’re already talking to somebody. Or ignore 
it (by tapping Ignore).
To take the new call while keeping the first caller on hold, tap the Hold Call + 
Answer button that appears, as shown in Figure 4-7. You can then toggle 
between calls (placing one or the other on hold) by tapping either the Swap 
button or the first call at the top of the screen.
If this is too much for you and that second caller is really important, tap End 
Call + Answer to ditch caller number one.
 
 
 
Figure 4-6: Managing calls.  
Figure 4-7: Swapping calls.

66
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Conference calls
Now suppose caller number one and caller number two know each other. Or 
you’d like to play matchmaker so they get to know each other. Tap Merge 
Calls so all three of you can chitchat. At first the phone number of each caller 
will scroll at the top of your screen like a rolling ticker. A few seconds later 
the ticker is replaced by the word Conference with a circled right-pointing 
arrow to its immediate right.
Now let’s assume you have to talk to your whole sales team at once. It may 
be time to initiate a full-blown conference call, which effectively takes this 
merge-call idea to its extreme. You can merge up to five calls at a time. In 
fact, creating such a conference call on the iPhone may be simpler than get-
ting the same five people in a physical room at the same time.
Here’s how you do it. Start by making a call and then placing the caller on 
hold as noted in the preceding “Juggling calls” section. Tap Add Call to make 
another call, and then Merge Calls to bring everybody together. Repeat this 
exercise to add the other calls.
Other conference call tidbits:
 
✓ iPhone is actually a two-line phone, and one of the available lines can be 
involved in a conference call.
 
✓ If you want to drop a call from a conference, tap Conference, and then 
tap the red circle with the little picture of the phone in it that appears 
next to the call. Tap End Call to make that caller go bye-bye.
 
✓ You can speak privately with one of the callers in a conference. Tap 
Conference, and then tap Private next to the caller you want to go hush-
hush with. Tap Merge Calls to bring the caller back into the Conference 
so everyone can hear him or her.
 
✓ You can add a new incoming caller to an existing conference call by 
tapping Hold Call + Answer followed by Merge Calls.
There’s even more you can do with iPhone the phone. Check out Chapter 13 
for extra phone tips. Meanwhile, we recommend that you read the next 
chapter to figure out how to become a whiz at text messaging.

Texting 1, 2, 3: 
Messages and Notes
In This Chapter
▶ Sending and receiving SMS (text) and MMS (multimedia) messages
▶ Using the Notes application
C
hances are this is your first experience with an intelligent virtual key-
board. In the beginning, it will probably feel awkward. Within a few 
days, however, many iPhone users report that they not only have become 
comfortable using it but have become proficient virtual typists as well.
By the time you finish this chapter, we think you’ll feel comfortable 
and proficient, too. You discover all about using the virtual 
keyboard in Chapter 2. In this chapter, we focus on two 
iPhone applications that use text — namely, Messages 
and Notes.
Messaging
The Messages application lets you exchange short 
text messages with any cell phone that supports 
the SMS protocol.
New in iPhone OS 3.0 is support for the MMS protocol, 
which lets you exchange pictures, contacts, videos, 
ringtones, and other audio recordings, and locations with 
any cell phone that supports the MMS protocol.

68
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
SMS is the acronym for the Short Message Service protocol; MMS is the acro-
nym for the Multimedia Messaging Service protocol. Most phones sold today 
support one or both protocols.
 
MMS support is built into iPhone OS 3.0 and higher and works with iPhone 3G 
and 3GS (but not the first-generation iPhone). That’s the good news. The bad 
news, at least for those of us in the United States, is that it works only if your 
wireless carrier supports it. While 29 iPhone wireless operators in 76 coun-
tries already offer MMS support, Apple’s exclusive wireless partner in the 
United States (AT&T) is not expected to enable the service until late summer 
2009, long after this book is published. For what it’s worth, we did offer to fly 
to Italy or Switzerland to research MMS, but our publisher, not surprisingly, 
wasn’t buying it. The bottom line is that since there was no way we could test 
MMS, you should take information about MMS with a grain or two of salt.
Typing text on a cell phone with a 12-key numeric keypad is an unnatural act, 
which is why many people have never sent a single SMS or MMS message. 
The iPhone will change that. The intelligent virtual keyboard makes it easy 
to compose short text messages, and the big, bright, high-resolution screen 
makes it a pleasure to read them.
But before we get to the part where you send or receive messages, let’s go 
over some messaging basics:
 
✓ Both sender and receiver need SMS- or MMS-enabled mobile phones. 
Your iPhone qualifies, as does almost any mobile phone made in the 
past four or five years. Keep in mind that if you send messages to folks 
with a phone that doesn’t support SMS or MMS or who choose not to 
pay extra for messaging services, those folks will never get your mes-
sage nor will they even know you sent a message.
 
✓ Some phones (not the iPhone, of course) limit SMS messages to 160 
characters. If you try to send a longer message to one of these phones, 
your message may be truncated or split into multiple shorter messages. 
The point is that it’s a good idea to keep SMS messages brief.
 
✓ AT&T iPhone plans no longer include SMS or MMS messages. 
Individual SMS text messages currently cost 20¢ each unless you sub-
scribe to one of the optional SMS text message plans, which start at 
$5 per month for 200 messages. Although MMS isn’t yet supported by 
AT&T and pricing for à la carte MMS messages was unavailable at press 
time, AT&T has stated that MMS will be available at no additional cost to 
customers with an SMS text messaging bundle.
 
 Each individual message in a conversation counts against this total, 
even if it’s only a one-word reply such as “OK,” or “CUL8R” (which is 
Teenager for “see you later”).

69
 Chapter 5: Texting 1, 2, 3: Messages and Notes
 
✓ You can usually increase the number of messages in your plan for a 
few more dollars a month. This is almost always less expensive than 
paying for them à la carte.
 
✓ You can send or receive messages only over your wireless carrier’s 
network (which is AT&T in the U.S.). In other words, SMS or MMS mes-
sages can’t be sent or received over a Wi-Fi connection.
Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let’s start with how to send 
messages.
You send me: Sending SMS text messages
Tap the Messages icon on the Home screen to launch the Messages applica-
tion (the app formerly known as Text), and then tap the little pencil-and-
paper icon in the top-right corner of the screen to start a new text message.
 
 At this point, the To field is active and awaiting your input. You can do three 
things at this point:
 
✓ If the recipient isn’t in your Contacts list, type his or her cell phone 
number.
 
✓ If the recipient is in your Contacts list, type the first few letters of the 
name. A list of matching contacts appears. Scroll through it if necessary 
and tap the name of the contact.
 
 The more letters you type, the shorter the list becomes.
 
✓ Tap the blue + icon on the right side of the To field to select a name from 
your Contacts list.
There’s a fourth option if you want to compose the message first and address 
it later. Tap inside the text-entry field (the oval-shaped area just above the 
keyboard and to the left of the Send button) to activate it, and then type your 
message. When you’ve finished typing, tap the To field and use one of the 
preceding techniques to address your message.
When you have finished addressing and composing, tap the Send button to 
send your message on its merry way. And that’s all there is to it.
Being a golden receiver: Receiving 
SMS text messages
First things first. If you want to hear an alert sound when you receive a mes-
sage, tap the Settings icon on your Home screen, tap Sounds, tap the New 

70
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Text Message item, and then tap one of the available sounds. You can audi-
tion the sounds by tapping them.
 
You hear the sounds when you audition them in the Settings app, even if you 
have the Ring/Silent switch set to Silent. After you exit the Settings applica-
tion, however, you won’t hear a sound when a message arrives if the Ring/
Silent switch is set to Silent.
If you don’t want to hear an alert when a message arrives, instead of tapping 
one of the listed sounds, tap the first item in the list: None.
If you receive a message when your phone is asleep, all or part of the text 
message and the name of the sender appear on the Unlock screen when you 
wake your phone.
If your phone is awake and unlocked when a message arrives, all or part of 
the message and the name of the sender appear on the screen in front of 
whatever’s already there, along with Close and Reply buttons. At the same 
time, the Messages icon on the Home screen displays the number of unread 
messages. You can see all of this in Figure 5-1.
To read or reply to the message, tap Reply.
To read or reply to a message after you’ve tapped the Close button, tap the 
Messages icon. If a message other than the one you’re interested in appears 
on the screen when you launch the Messages application, tap Messages in 
the top-left corner of the screen, and then tap the recipient’s name; that per-
son’s messages appear on the screen.
To reply to the message on the screen, tap the text-entry field to the left of 
the Send button, and the keyboard appears. Type your reply and then tap 
Send.
Your conversation is saved as a series of text bubbles. Your messages appear 
on the right side of the screen in green bubbles; the other person’s messages 
appear on the left in gray bubbles, as shown in Figure 5-2.
You can delete a conversation in two ways:
 
✓ If you’re viewing the conversation: Tap the Clear button at the top-
right of the conversation screen.
 
✓ If you’re viewing the list of text messages: Tap the Edit button at the 
top-left of the Messages list, tap the red – icon that appears to the left of 
the person’s name, and then tap the Delete button that appears to the 
right of the name.

MMS: Like SMS with media
To send a picture or video (iPhone 3GS only) in a message, follow the instruc-
tions for sending a text message and then tap the camera icon to the left of 
the text-entry field at the bottom of the screen. You’ll then have the option of 
using an existing picture or video or taking a new one. You can also add text 
to photos or videos if you like. When you’re finished, tap the Send button.
If you receive a picture or video in a message, it appears in a bubble just like 
text. Tap it to see it full-screen.
 
 Tap the icon in the lower-left corner (the one that looks like an arrow trying 
to escape from a rectangle) for additional options. If you don’t see the icon, 
tap the picture or video once and the icon will magically appear.
Smart messaging tricks
Here are some more things you can do with messages:

72
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
✓ To send a message to someone in your Favorites or Recents list, tap 
the Phone icon on the Home screen, and then tap Favorites or Recents, 
respectively. Tap the blue > icon to the right of a name or number, and 
then scroll down and tap Text Message at the bottom of the Info screen.
 
✓ To call or e-mail someone to whom you’ve sent an SMS or MMS message, 
tap the Messages icon on the Home screen, and then tap the person’s 
name in the Messages list. Tap the Call button at the top of the conver-
sation to call the person, or tap the Contact Info button and then tap an 
e-mail address to send an e-mail.
 
 You can use this technique only if the contact has an e-mail address.
 
✓ To add someone to whom you’ve sent an SMS or MMS text message to 
your Contacts list, tap the person’s name or phone number in the Text 
Messages list and then tap the Add to Contacts button.
 
✓ If an SMS or MMS message includes a URL, tap it to open that Web page 
in Safari.
 
✓ If an SMS or MMS message includes a phone number, tap it to call that 
number.
 
✓ If an SMS or MMS message includes an e-mail address, tap it to open a 
pre-addressed e-mail message in Mail.
 
✓ If an SMS or MMS message includes a street address, tap it to see a map 
in Maps.
And that’s all there is to it. You are now an official SMS or MMS text-message 
maven.
Take Note of Notes
Notes is an application that creates text notes that you can save or send 
through e-mail. To create a note, first tap the Notes icon on the Home screen, 
and then tap the + button in the top-right corner to start a new note. The 
virtual keyboard appears. Type the note. When you’re finished, tap the Done 
button in the top-right corner to save the note. (The Done button appears 
only when the virtual keyboard is on-screen, however, so you can’t see it in 
Figure 5-3.)

73
 Chapter 5: Texting 1, 2, 3: Messages and Notes
 
 
Figure 5-3: The Notes application 
 
revealed.
After a note is saved, you can do the following:
 
✓ Tap the Notes button at the top-left corner of the screen to see a list of 
all your notes. When the list is on-screen, just tap a note to open and 
view it.
 
✓ Tap the left or right arrow button at the bottom of the screen to read the 
previous or next note.
 
✓ Tap the letter icon at the bottom of the screen to e-mail the note using 
the Mail application (see Chapter 11 for more about Mail).
 
✓ Tap the trash can icon at the bottom of the screen to delete the note.
 
We’d be remiss if we didn’t remind you that as long as you’re running iPhone 
OS 3.0 or later, you can sync notes with your computer (see Chapter 3).
And that’s all she wrote. You now know everything there is to know about 
creating and managing notes with Notes.

Calendars and Calculators and 
Clocks (Voice, Too) — Oh, My
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the calendar’s different views and functions
▶ Calculating with your iPhone
▶ Using the clock as an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer too
▶ Leaving voice reminders
T
he iPhone is a smartphone. And, as a smart device, it can remind you of 
appointments, tell you the time where you live (or halfway around the 
world), and even solve simple arithmetic.
Over the next few pages, we look at four of the iPhone’s 
core — if, frankly, unsexy — applications. Indeed, we’d 
venture to say that no one bought an iPhone because 
of its calendar, calculator, clock, or voice recorder. 
Just the same, it’s awfully handy having these 
programs around.
Working with the Calendar
The Calendar program lets you keep on top of your 
appointments and events (birthdays, anniversaries, 
and the like). You open it by tapping the Calendar icon 
on the Home screen. The icon is smart in its own right 
because it changes daily; the day of the week and date are 
displayed.

76
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
You have three main ways to peek at your calendar: List, Day, and Month 
views. Choosing one is as simple as tapping on the List, Day, or Month button 
at the bottom of the Calendar screen. From each view, you can always return 
to the current day by tapping the Today button.
Take a closer look in the following sections.
List view
List view isn’t complicated. As its name indicates, List view, shown in 
Figure 6-1, presents current and future appointments in list format. You can 
drag the list up or down with your finger or flick to rapidly scroll through 
the list. List view compensates for the lack of Week-at-a-Glance view, 
though Apple certainly could add such a feature, perhaps even by the time 
you read this book.
If you’re a Mac user who uses iCal, you can create multiple calendars and 
choose which ones to sync with your phone (as described in Chapter 3). 
What’s more, you can choose to display any or all of your calendars.
 
The iPhone can display the color-coding you assigned in iCal. Cool, huh?
 
Be careful: To-do items created in iCal aren’t synced and don’t appear on 
your iPhone.
Day view
Day view, shown in Figure 6-2, reveals the appointments of a given 24-hour 
period (though you have to scroll up or down to see an entire day’s worth of 
entries).
Month view
By now, you’re getting the hang of these different views. When your iPhone 
is in Month view, you can see appointments from January to December. In 
this monthly calendar view, a dot appears on any day that has appointments 
or events scheduled. Tap that day to see the list of activities the dot repre-
sents. The list of activities is just below the month in Month view, as shown 
in Figure 6-3.

Adding Calendar Entries
In Chapter 3, you discover pretty much everything there is to know about 
syncing your iPhone, including syncing calendar entries from your Windows 
machine (using the likes of Microsoft Outlook) or Mac (using iCal or 
Microsoft Entourage).
Of course, in plenty of situations, you enter appointments on the fly. Adding 
appointments directly to the iPhone is easy:
 
1. Tap the Calendar icon at the top of the screen, and then tap the List, 
Day, or Month button.
 
2. Tap the plus sign (+) button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
 The + button appears whether you’re in List, Day, or Month view. 
Tapping it displays the Add Event screen, shown in Figure 6-4.
 
3. Tap the Title/Location field and finger-type as much (or as little) infor-
mation as you feel is necessary.
 
 Tapping displays the virtual keyboard.
 
4. Tap Done.
 
5. If your calendar entry has a start time or end time (or both):
 
a. Tap the Starts/Ends field.
 
b. In the bottom half of the screen that appears (see Figure 6-5), 
choose the time the event starts and then the time it ends.
 
 Use your finger to roll separate wheels for the date, hour, and 
minute (in 5-minute intervals) and to specify AM or PM. It’s a little 
like manipulating one of those combination bicycle locks or an old-
fashioned date stamp used with an inkpad.
 
c. Tap Done when you’re finished.
 
6. If you’re entering a birthday or another all-day milestone, tap the All-
Day button so that On (rather than Off) is showing. Then tap Done.
 
 Because the time isn’t relevant for an all-day entry, note that the bottom 
half of the screen now has wheels for just the month, day, and year.
 
7. If you’re setting up a recurring entry, such as an anniversary, tap 
the Repeat window. Tap to indicate how often the event in question 
recurs, and then tap Done.
 
 The options are Every Day, Every Week, Every 2 Weeks, Every Month, 
and Every Year.

Figure 6-4: You’re about to add an  
Figure 6-5: Controlling the Starts and
 
event to your iPhone.  
Ends fields is like manipulating a
 
 
bike lock. 
 
8. If you want to set a reminder or alert for the entry, tap Alert. Then tap 
a time, and then tap Done.
 
 Alerts can be set to arrive on the actual date of an event, 2 days before, 1 
day before, 2 hours before, 1 hour before, 30 minutes before, 15 minutes 
before, or 5 minutes before. When the appointment time rolls around, 
you hear a sound and see a message like the one shown in Figure 6-6.
 
 If you’re the kind of person who needs an extra nudge, set another 
reminder by tapping on the Second Alert field.
 
9. Tap Calendar to assign the entry to a particular calendar, and then tap 
the calendar you have in mind (Home or Work, for example). Then 
tap Done.
 
10. Tap Availability (if it’s shown on your phone) to indicate whether 
you’re busy, free, tentative, or out of office. Then tap Done.
 
11. If you want to enter notes about the appointment or event, tap Notes. 
Type your note, and then tap Done.
 
 A virtual keyboard pops up so that you can type those notes.
 
12. Tap Done after you finish entering everything.

80
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
 
Figure 6-6: Alerts make it hard to forget.
 
Choose a default calendar by tapping Settings and then Mail, Contacts, and 
Calendars and then flicking the screen until the Calendar section appears. Tap 
Default Calendar and select the calendar that you want to show up regularly.
If you travel long distances for your job, you can also make events appear 
according to whichever time zone you selected for your calendars. In the 
Calendar settings, tap Time Zone Support to turn it on, and then tap Time 
Zone. Type the time zone location on the keyboard that appears.
When Time Zone Support is turned off, events are displayed according to the 
time zone of your current location.
 
Turn off a calendar alert by tapping Settings and tapping Sounds and then 
making sure that the Calendar Alerts button is turned off.
If you want to modify an existing calendar entry, tap the entry, tap Edit, and 
then make whichever changes need to be made. To wipe out a calendar 
entry, tap Edit, and then tap Delete Event. You have a chance to confirm your 
choice by tapping either Delete Event (again) or Cancel.
Calendar entries you create on your iPhone are synchronized with the calen-
dar you specified in the iTunes Info pane.
Letting your calendar push you around
If you work for a company that uses Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, calendar 
entries and meeting invitations from coworkers can be pushed to your device 
so that they show up on the screen moments after they’re entered, even if 
they’re entered on computers at work. Setting up an account to facilitate this 
pushing of calendar entries to your iPhone is a breeze, although you should 
check with your company’s tech or IT department to make sure that your 
employer allows it. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Tap Settings.
 
2. Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.

81
 Chapter 6: Calendars and Calculators and Clocks (Voice, Too) — Oh, My
 
3. Tap Add Account.
 
4. From the Add Account list, shown in Figure 6-7, tap Microsoft 
Exchange.
 
5. Fill in the e-mail address, username, password, and description fields, 
and then tap Next.
 
6. Enter your server address on the next screen that appears. The rest of 
the fields should be filled in with the e-mail address, username, and 
password you just entered, as shown in Figure 6-8. Tap Next.
 
 
 
Figure 6-7: The Add Account screen. 
Figure 6-8: Fill in the blanks to set up 
 
 
your corporate account.
 
7. Tap the On switches for all the information types you want to syn-
chronize using Microsoft Exchange, from among Mail, Contacts, and 
Calendars.
 
 You should be good to go now, although some employers may require 
you to add passcodes to safeguard company secrets.
 
If your business-issued iPhone is ever lost or stolen — or it turns out that 
you’re a double-agent working for a rival company — your employer’s IT 
administrators can remotely wipe your device clean.

82
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
If your company uses Microsoft Exchange 2007, you don’t have to enter the 
address of your Exchange server. iPhone can determine it automatically.
 
Only one account taking advantage of Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync can be 
configured to work on your iPhone.
Responding to meeting invitations
The iPhone has one more important button, located just to the right of the List, 
Day, and Month buttons — but you see it only when the Exchange calendar 
syncing feature is turned on. The Invitations button, which shows up if you 
have an invitation on your calendar, is represented by an arrow pointing down-
ward into a half-rectangle. (The button is not shown in Figures 6-1, 6-2, or 6-3.)
Tap the Invitations button now to view your pending invitations, and then tap 
any of the items on the list to see more details.
Suppose that a meeting invitation arrives from your boss. You can see who 
else is attending the shindig, check scheduling conflicts, and more. Tap 
Accept to let the meeting organizer know you’re attending, tap Decline if you 
have something better to do (and aren’t worried about upsetting the person 
who signs your paycheck), or tap Maybe if you’re waiting for a better offer.
 
You can choose to receive an alert every time someone sends you an invita-
tion. In the Calendar settings, tap New Invitation Alerts so that the On button 
in blue is showing.
If you take advantage of the Apple $99-a-year MobileMe service (formerly 
named .Mac), you can keep calendar entries synchronized between your 
iPhone and PC or Mac. When you make a scheduling change on your iPhone, 
it’s automatically updated on your computer, and vice versa. Choose 
MobileMe from the Add Account screen (refer to Figure 6-7) to get started.
You learn more about configuring MobileMe when we discuss the Fetch New 
Data setting in Chapter 13.
Subscribing to calendars
You can subscribe to calendars that adhere to the so-called CalDAV and 
iCalendar (.ics) standards, which are supported by the popular Google and 
Yahoo! calendars, or iCal on the Mac. Although you can read entries on the 
iPhone from the calendars you subscribe to, you can’t create new entries 
from the phone or edit the entries that are already present.

83
 Chapter 6: Calendars and Calculators and Clocks (Voice, Too) — Oh, My
To subscribe to one of these calendars, tap Settings, and then tap Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars. From there, tap Add Account and then tap Other. You 
then choose either Add CalDAV Account or Add Subscribed Calendar. You’ll 
have to enter the server where the iPhone can find the calendar you have in 
mind, and if need be a username, password, and optional description.
Calculate This
Quick — what’s 3,467.8 times 982.3? Why, the answer (of course) is 
3,406,419.94.
We can solve the problem quickly, thanks to the iPhone calculator, buried 
(until it’s needed) under another of those Home screen icons.
Your handy iPhone calculator does just fine for adding, subtracting, multi-
plying, and dividing. Numbers and symbols (such as C for clear, and M+ for 
memory) are large and easy to see.
You may think: “This isn’t exactly the most advanced calculator I’ve ever 
used.” And, you’d be right. It can’t handle a sine or a square root, much less 
more advanced functions.
Fortunately, the math whizzes at Apple were thinking right along with you. To 
see what they came up with, rotate the iPhone. As if by sleight of hand, your 
pocket calculator is now a full-fledged scientific calculator, capable of tack-
ling dozens of complex functions. Take a gander at both calculators shown in 
Figure 6-9.
Isn’t it nice to know just how much smarter a smartphone can make you feel?

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Punching the Clock
We hear you: “So the iPhone has a clock. Big whoop. Doesn’t every cell phone 
have a clock?”
Well, yes, every cell phone does have a clock. But not every phone has a world 
clock that lets you display the time in multiple cities on multiple continents. 
And, not every cell phone has an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer to boot.
Let’s take a look at the time functions on your iPhone.
World clock
Want to know the time in Beijing or Bogota? Tapping World Clock (inside the 
Clock application) lets you display the time in numerous cities around the 
globe, as shown in Figure 6-10. When the clock face is dark, it’s nighttime in 
the city you chose; if the face is white, it’s during daytime hours.
 
 
Figure 6-10: What time is it in Budapest?
Tap the + symbol in the upper-right corner of the screen and use the virtual 
keyboard to start typing a city name. The moment you press the first letter, 
in fact, the iPhone displays a list of cities or countries that begin with 
that letter. So, typing V brings up both Vancouver, Canada, and Caracas, 

85
 Chapter 6: Calendars and Calculators and Clocks (Voice, Too) — Oh, My
Venezuela, among myriad other possibilities. You can create clocks for as 
many cities as you like, though the times in only four cities appear on a single 
screen. To see times in other cities, scroll up or down.
To remove a city from the list, tap Edit and then tap the red circle with the 
white horizontal line in it to the left of the city you want to drop. Then tap 
Delete.
You can also rearrange the order of the cities displaying the time. Tap Edit, 
and then press your finger against the symbol with three horizontal lines to 
the right of the city you want to move up or down in the list. Then drag the 
city to its new spot.
Alarm clock
Ever try to set the alarm in a hotel room? It’s remarkable how complicated 
setting an alarm can be, on even the most inexpensive clock radio. Like 
almost everything else, the procedure is dirt-simple on the iPhone:
 
1. Tap Clock on the Home screen to display the Clock application.
 
2. Tap the Alarm icon at the bottom of the screen.
 
3. Tap the plus sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
4. Choose the time of the alarm by rotating the wheel in the bottom half 
of the screen.
 
 This step is similar to the action required to set the time that an event 
starts or ends on your calendar.
 
5. If you want the alarm to go off on other days, tap Repeat and then tell 
the iPhone the days you want the alarm to be repeated, as in Every 
Monday, Every Tuesday, Every Wednesday, and so on.
 
6. Tap Sound to choose the ringtone (see Chapter 4) that will wake you 
up. You can even use the custom ringtone you created.
 
 Your choice is a matter of personal preference, but we can tell you that 
the ringtone for the appropriately named Alarm managed to wake Ed 
from a deep sleep.
 
7. Tap Snooze to have the alarm appear, accompanied by a Snooze 
button, on the screen.
 
 Tap the Snooze button to shut down the alarm for nine minutes.
 
8. If you want to call the alarm something other than, um, Alarm, tap the 
Label field and use the virtual keyboard to type another descriptor.
 
9. Tap Save when the alarm settings are to your liking.

86
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
You know that an alarm has been set and activated because of the tiny status 
icon (surprise, surprise — it looks like a clock) that appears in the upper-
right corner of the screen.
 
An alarm takes precedence over any tracks you’re listening to on your iPod. 
Songs momentarily pause when an alarm goes off and resume when you turn 
off the alarm (or press the Snooze button).
 
When your Ring/Silent switch is set to silent, your iPhone doesn’t ring, play 
alert effects, or make iPod sounds. But it will play alarms from the Clock 
application. That’s good to know when you set your phone to Silent at a 
movie or the opera. And, although it seems obvious, if you want to hear an 
alarm, you have to make sure that the iPhone volume is turned up.
Stopwatch
If you’re helping a loved one train for a marathon, the iPhone Stopwatch 
function can provide an assist. Open it by tapping Stopwatch in the Clock 
application.
Just tap Start to begin the count, and then tap Stop at the finish line. You can 
also tap a Lap button to monitor the times between laps.
Timer
Cooking a hard-boiled egg or Thanksgiving turkey? Again, the iPhone comes 
to the rescue. Tap Timer (within the Clock app) and then rotate the hour 
and minute wheels until the time you have in mind is highlighted. Tap When 
Timer Ends to choose the ringtone that will signify time’s up.
After you set up the length of the timer, tap Start when you’re ready to begin. 
You can watch the minutes and seconds wind down on the screen, if you 
have nothing better to do.
If you’re doing anything else on the iPhone — admiring photos, say — you 
hear the ringtone and see a Timer Done message on the screen at the appro-
priate moment. Tap OK to silence the ringtone.
Voice Memos
Consider all the times you’d find it useful to have a voice recorder in your 
pocket — perhaps when you’re attending a lecture or interviewing an impor-
tant source (that’s a biggie for us journalist types). Or, maybe you just want to 
leave yourself a quickie reminder about something (“Pick up milk after work”).

87
 Chapter 6: Calendars and Calculators and Clocks (Voice, Too) — Oh, My
Well, you’re in luck. Apple includes a built-in digital voice recorder as part of 
its iPhone 3.0 software upgrade.
 
A bunch of third-party apps add voice recording to the iPhone. Ed uses 
Recorder from Retronyms, and Bob uses iTalk Recorder from Griffin.
Making a recording
After you have that recorder in your pocket, how do you capture audio? 
When you tap the Voice Memos icon on the Home screen, up pops the micro-
phone displayed in Figure 6-11. We’d tell you to talk right into that micro-
phone, but it’s mainly for show. The real iPhone mic is at the bottom of the 
device, next to the dock connector (as pictured in Chapter 1, Figure 1-2).
Tap the red record button in the lower-left part of the screen to start record-
ing. You see the needle in the audio level meter move as the Voice Memo 
detects sounds, even when you pause a recording by tapping the red button 
a second time. A clock at the top of the screen indicates how long your 
recording session is lasting. It’s that easy.
 
The audio meter can help you determine an ideal recording level. Apple rec-
ommends that the loudest level on the meter be between –3dB and 0dB. We 
recommend speaking in a normal voice. To adjust the recording level, simply 
move the microphone closer or farther from your mouth.
 
 
Figure 6-11: Miked up: Leaving a 
 
voice memo. 

88
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Listening to recordings
After you capture your thoughts or musings, how do you play them back?
You have a couple of ways, and both involve tapping the same button:
 
✓ Immediately after recording the memo, tap the button to the right of 
the audio level meter. A list of all your recordings pops up in chrono-
logical order, with the most recent memo on top, as shown in Figure 
6-12. That’s the memo you just recorded, of course, and it automatically 
starts to play.
 
✓ If you haven’t just recorded something, tapping the button to the right 
summons the same list of all your recordings. Now, nothing plays until 
you choose a recording from the list by tapping it. You have to tap again 
on the little play button that appears to the left of the date and time 
that the recording was made (or, alternatively, to the left of the label 
you assigned to the recording, as we explain in the “Adding a label to a 
recording” section, later in this chapter.)
 
You can drag the playhead along the Scrubber bar to move ahead to any 
point in the memo.
 
If you don’t hear anything after tapping play, tap the Speaker button in the 
upper-left corner of the screen. Sound pumps through the built-in iPhone 
speaker.
Trimming recordings
Maybe the person who left the recording rambled on and on. You just want 
to cut to the chase, for goodness’ sake. Fortunately, you can trim the audio 
directly on the iPhone.
Tap the right-pointing arrow next to the memo you want to trim, and then tap 
Trim Memo. A narrow, blue tube representing the recording appears inside 
a yellow bar, as shown in Figure 6-13. Drag the edges of this audio region 
to adjust the start and end points of the memo. You can preview your edit 
before tapping the Trim Voice Memo button.
 
Your edits are permanent. Make sure that you’re completely satisfied with 
your cuts before tapping Trim Voice Memo.

someone says too much.
Adding a label to a recording
When a memo is added to your list of recordings, it just shows up with the 
date and time of the recording. You see no other identifier. As memos accu-
mulate, you may have a tough time remembering which recording was made 
for which purpose. You can label a recording with one of the labels Apple has 
supplied or, better, create a custom label yourself.
Here’s how:
 
1. From the list of recordings, tap the right-pointing arrow on the memo 
to which you want to add a label.
 
 The Voice Memo information screen appears.
 
2. Tap the right-pointing arrow in the box showing the date and time and 
the length of the video you just recorded.
 
3. Choose a label from the list that appears.
 
 Your choices are None, Podcast, Interview, Lecture, Idea, Meeting, 
Memo, and Custom.

90
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
4. Choose Custom to type your own label (Professor Snookins on 
Biology, for example).
 
 That’s it. Your recording is duly identified.
Sharing memos
You may want to share with others the good professor’s wacky theories. Tap 
Share from either the main Voice Memos list or the information screen. You 
then have the option to either e-mail the memo or (if your carrier permits it) 
send it as part of an MMS, or multimedia picture, message.
 
You can also sync Voice Memos to your PC or Mac by using iTunes, as 
described in Chapter 3.
When you have no further use for a recording, you can remove it from the 
Voice Memos app by tapping it on the list and then tapping the Delete button.

Part III
The Multimedia 
iPhone

Your iPhone is arguably the best iPod ever 
invented. So in this part we look at the multi-
media side of your phone — audio, video, and still 
pictures, too. There has never been a phone that 
was this much fun to use; in this part we show you 
how to wring the most out of every multimedia bit 
of it.
First we explore how to enjoy listening to music, 
podcasts, and audiobooks on your iPhone. Then 
we look at some video, both literally and ﬁ gura-
tively. We start with a quick segment about how 
to ﬁ nd good video for your iPhone, followed by 
instructions for watching video on your iPhone. 
Finally, we provide a delightful little ditty about 
shooting and sharing video with your iPhone 3GS.
Before we leave the video scene, you also see 
how to have a blast with video from the famous 
YouTube Web site, using iPhone’s built-in You-
Tube application. We wrap up this multimedia 
part with everything you always wanted to know 
about photos and iPhones: how to shoot them 
well, how to store them, how to sync them, and 
how to do all kinds of other interesting things 
with them.

Get in Tune(s): 
Audio on Your iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out your iPhone’s inner iPod
▶ Taking control of your tunes
▶ Customizing your audio experience
▶ Shopping with the iTunes app
A
s we mention elsewhere in this book, your iPhone is perhaps the best 
iPod ever — especially for working with audio and video. In this chap-
ter, we show you how to use your iPhone for audio; in Chapter 8, we 
cover video.
We start with a quick tour of the iPhone’s iPod applica-
tion. Then we look at how to use your iPhone as an 
audio player. After you’re nice and comfy with using 
it this way, we show you how to customize the lis-
tening experience so that it’s just the way you like 
it. Then we offer a few tips to help you get the most 
out of using your iPhone as an audio player. Finally, 
we show you how to use the iTunes application to 
buy music, audiobooks, videos, and more and how 
to download free content, such as podcasts.
We assume that you already synced your iPhone with 
your computer and that your iPhone contains audio 
content — songs, podcasts, or audiobooks. If you don’t 
have any audio on your iPhone yet, we humbly suggest that 
you get some (flip to Chapter 3 and follow the instructions) before 
you read the rest of this chapter — or the next chapter, for that matter.
Okay, now that you have some audio content on your iPhone to play with, 
are you ready to rock?

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Introducing the iPod inside Your iPhone
To use your iPhone as an iPod, just tap the iPod icon in the lower-right 
corner of the Home screen. At the bottom of the screen that appears, you 
should see five icons: Playlists, Artists, Songs, Videos, and More.
If you don’t see these icons, tap the Back button in the upper-left corner of 
the screen (the one that looks like a little arrow pointing to the left).
Or, if you’re holding your iPhone sideways (the long edges are parallel to the 
ground), rotate it 90 degrees so that it’s upright (the short edges are parallel 
to the ground).
 
You’ll understand why your iPhone’s orientation matters when you read the 
later section “Go with the Cover (Flow).”
Playlists
Tap the Playlists icon at the bottom of the screen and a list of playlists 
appears. If you have no playlists on your iPhone, don’t sweat it. Just know 
that if you had some, this is where they’d be. (Playlists let you organize songs 
around a particular theme or mood: opera arias, romantic ballads, British 
invasion — whatever. Younger folks sometimes call them mixes.)
Tap a playlist and you see a list of the songs it contains. If the list is longer 
than one screen, flick upward to scroll down. Tap a song in the list and it 
plays. Or, tap Shuffle at the top of the list to hear a song from that playlist 
(and all subsequent songs) at random.
That’s all there is to selecting and playing songs from a playlist.
Artistic license
Now we tell you how to find and play a song ordered by artist name rather 
than by playlist. Tap the Artists icon at the bottom of the screen and an 
alphabetical list of artists appears.
If the list is longer than one screen (which it probably is), you can, of course, 
flick upward to scroll down or flick downward to scroll up. But you have 
easier ways to find an artist.
For example, at the top of the screen, above the first artist’s name, you see a 
search field. Tap it and type the name of the artist you want to find. Now tap 
the Search button to see a list of all matching artists.

95
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
Another way to find an artist is to tap one of the little letters on the right side 
of the screen, to jump directly to artists whose names start with that letter. In 
Figure 7-1, for example, that letter is H.
 
Magnifying glass
Little letters
 
Figure 7-1: Tap the H on the right 
 
side of the screen to jump to song 
 
titles that begin with an H.
 
Notice that a magnifying glass appears above the A on the right side of the 
screen. Tap the magnifying glass to jump directly to the search field.
As you can see, those letters are extremely small, so unless you have tiny fin-
gers, you may have to settle for a letter close to the one you want or else tap 
several times until the correct one is added.
Tap an artist’s name and one of two things occurs:
 
✓ If you have songs from more than one album by an artist in your music 
library: A list of albums appears. Tap an album to see a list of the songs 
it contains. Or, tap the first item in the list of albums — All Songs — to 
see a list of all songs on all albums by that artist.

96
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
✓ If all songs in your music library by that artist are on the same album 
or aren’t associated with a specific album: A list of all songs by that 
artist appears.
Either way, just tap a song and it begins to play.
Song selection
Now we tell you how to find a song by its title and play it. Tap the Songs icon 
at the bottom of the screen and a list of songs appears.
You find songs the same ways you find artists: Flick upward or downward 
to scroll; use the search field at the top of the list; or tap a little letter on the 
right side of the screen.
 
If you’re not sure which song you want to listen to, try this: Tap the Shuffle 
button at the top of the list between the search field and the first song title. 
Your iPhone will now play songs from your music library at random.
 
You can also find songs (or artists, for that matter) by typing their names in a 
Spotlight search, as we mention in Chapter 2.
Taking Control of Your Tunes
Now that you have the basics down, take a look at some other things you can 
do when your iPhone is in its iPod mode.
Go with the (Cover) Flow
Finding tracks by playlist, artist, or song is cool, but finding them with Cover 
Flow is even cooler. Cover Flow lets you browse your music collection by its 
album artwork. To use Cover Flow, turn your iPhone sideways (long edges 
parallel to the ground). As long as you aren’t browsing or viewing video (and, 
of course, you tapped the iPod icon on the Home screen so that your iPhone 
behaves like an iPod), Cover Flow fills the screen, as shown in Figure 7-2.
Flipping through your cover art in Cover Flow is simple. All you have to do 
is drag or flick your finger left or right on the screen and the covers go flying 
by. Flick or drag quickly and the covers whiz by; flick or drag slowly and the 
covers move leisurely. Or, tap a particular cover on the left or right of the 
current (centered) cover and that cover jumps to the center.

97
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
 
Play/Pause
Info
 
Figure 7-2: Go with the Cover Flow.
Try it — you’ll like it! Here’s how to put Cover Flow to work for you:
 
✓ To see tracks (songs) on an album: Tap the cover when it’s centered or 
tap the info button (the little i) in the lower-right corner of the screen. 
The track list appears.
 
✓ To play a track: Tap its name in the list. If the list is long, scroll by drag-
ging or flicking up and down on it.
 
✓ To go back to Cover Flow: Tap the title bar at the top of the track list or 
tap the little i button again.
 
✓ To play or pause the current song: Tap the Play/Pause button in the 
lower-left corner.
 
If no cover art exists for an album in your collection, the iPhone displays a 
plain-looking cover decorated with a single musical note. The name of the 
album appears below this generic cover.
And that, friends, is all there is to the iPhone’s cool Cover Flow mode.
Flow’s not here right now
As you saw earlier in this chapter, when you hold your iPhone vertically (the 
short edges are parallel to the ground) and tap the Playlists, Artists, or Songs 
button, you see a list rather than Cover Flow.

98
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Along the same lines, when you’re listening to music, the controls you see are 
different depending on which way you hold your iPhone. When you hold your 
iPhone vertically, as shown in Figure 7-3, you see controls that don’t appear 
when you hold your iPhone sideways. Furthermore, the controls you see 
when viewing the Playlists, Artists, or Songs lists are slightly different from 
the controls you see when a song is playing.

Figure 7-3: Hold your iPhone vertically when

Here’s another cool side effect of holding your iPhone vertically: If you add 
lyrics to a song in iTunes on your computer (by selecting the song, choosing 
File➪Get Info, and then pasting or typing the lyrics into the Lyrics tab in the 
Info window), the lyrics are displayed along with the cover art.

99
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
Here’s how to use the controls that appear when the iPhone is vertical:
 
✓ Back button: Tap to return to whichever list you used last — Playlists, 
Artists, or Songs.
 
✓ Switch to Track List button: Tap to switch to a list of tracks.
 
 If you don’t see the next three controls — the Repeat button, the 
Scrubber bar, and the Shuffle button — tap the album cover once to 
make them appear.
 
✓ Repeat button: Tap once to repeat songs in the current album or list. 
The button turns blue. Tap it again to play the current song repeatedly; 
the blue button displays the number 1 when it’s in this mode. Tap the 
button again to turn off this feature. The button goes back to its original 
gray color.
 
✓ Scrubber bar: Drag the little dot (the playhead) along the Scrubber bar 
to skip to any point within the song.
 
✓ Genius button: Tap once and a Genius Playlist appears with 25 songs 
that iTunes thinks will go great with the song that’s playing.
 
 The less popular the song, artist, or genre, the more likely the Genius 
will choke on it. When that happens, you see an alert asking you to try 
again because this song doesn’t have enough related songs to create a 
Genius playlist.
 
 At the top of the Genius playlist, you find three buttons:
 
• New: Select a different song to use as the basis for a Genius playlist.
 
• Refresh: See a list of 25 different songs that “go great with” the 
song you’re listening to.
 
• Save: Save this Genius playlist so that you can listen to it whenever 
you like.
 
 If you like the Genius feature, you can also create a new Genius playlist 
by tapping the Playlists button at the bottom of the screen and then tap-
ping Genius, which is the first item on the list of playlists.
 
✓ Shuffle button: Tap once to shuffle songs and play them in random order. 
The button turns blue when shuffling is enabled. Tap it again to play 
songs in order again. The button goes back to its original color — gray.
 
 You can also shuffle tracks in any list of songs — such as playlists or 
albums — by tapping the word Shuffle, which appears at the top of the 
list. Regardless of whether the Shuffle button has been tapped, this 
technique always plays songs in that list in random order. And, as you 

100
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
see later in this chapter, another setting, when enabled, lets you shake 
your iPhone from side-to-side to shuffle and play a different song at 
random.
 
✓ Restart/Previous Track/Rewind button: Tap once to go to the beginning 
of the track. Tap this button twice to go to the start of the preceding 
track in the list. Touch and hold this button to rewind the song at double 
speed.
 
✓ Play/Pause button: Tap to play or pause the song.
 
✓ Next Track/Fast Forward button: Tap to skip to the next track in the list. 
Touch and hold this button to fast-forward through the song at double 
speed.
 
✓ Volume control: Drag the little dot left or right to reduce or increase the 
volume level.
 
If you’re using the headset included with your iPhone, you can squeeze the 
mic to pause, and squeeze it again to play. You can also squeeze it twice in 
rapid succession to skip to the next song. Sweet!
When you tap the Switch to Track List button, the iPhone screen and the 
controls change, as shown in Figure 7-4.

Figure 7-4: Tap the Switch to Track List

 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
Here’s how to use those controls:
 
✓ Switch to Now Playing button: Tap to switch to the Now Playing screen 
for the current track (refer to Figure 7-3).
 
✓ Rating bar: Drag across the rating bar to rate the current track using 
zero to five stars. The track shown in Figure 7-4 has a four-star rating.
The tracks are the songs in the current list (album, playlist, or artist, for 
example), and the current track indicator shows you which song is now play-
ing (or paused). Tap any song in a track list to play it.
And that, gentle reader, is all you need to know to enjoy listening to music 
(and podcasts and audiobooks) on your iPhone.
Customizing Your Audio Experience
We cover a few features in particular in this section, in case you move on to 
the video side of your iPhone-as-an-iPod in Chapter 8. In this section, you find 
a bunch of stuff you can do to make your listening experience more enjoyable.
Finding even more choices
If you prefer to browse your audio collection by criteria other than playlist, 
artist, or song, you can: Tap the More button in the lower-right corner of the 
screen. The More list appears. Tap a choice in the list — albums, audiobooks, 
compilations, composers, genres, or podcasts — and your audio collection is 
organized by your criterion.
Wait — there’s more. You can swap out the Playlists, Artists, Songs, and 
Video buttons for ones that better suit your needs. For example, if you listen 
to a lot of podcasts and never watch video, you can replace the Video button 
with a Podcasts button.
Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the More button in the lower-right corner of the screen.
 
2. Tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
 
3. Drag any button on the screen — Albums, Podcasts, Audiobooks, 
Genres, Composers, Compilations — to the button at the bottom of the 
screen that you want to replace.
 
4. (Optional) Rearrange the five buttons now by dragging them to the 
left or right.
 
5. When you have everything just the way you like it, tap the Done 
button to return to the More list.

102
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
If you choose to replace one of the buttons this way, the item you replaced is 
available by tapping the More button and choosing the item that corresponds 
to the button you replaced in the More list.
Setting preferences
You can change a few preference settings to customize your iPhone-as-an-
iPod experience.
Play all songs at the same volume level
The iTunes Sound Check option automatically adjusts the level of songs so 
that they play at the same volume relative to each other. That way, one song 
never blasts out your ears even if the recording level is much louder than 
that of the song before or after it. To tell the iPhone to use these volume 
settings, you first have to turn on the feature in iTunes on your computer. 
Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (PC).
 
2. Click the Playback tab.
 
3. Select the Sound Check check box to enable it.
Now you need to tell the iPhone to use the Sound Check settings from iTunes. 
Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the iPhone’s Home screen.
 
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Sound Check to turn it on.
Choose an equalizer setting
An equalizer increases or decreases the relative levels of specific frequencies 
to enhance the sound you hear. Some equalizer settings emphasize the bass 
(low end) notes in a song; other equalizer settings make the higher frequen-
cies more apparent. The iPhone has more than a dozen equalizer presets, 
with names such as Acoustic, Bass Booster, Bass Reducer, Dance, Electronic, 
Pop, and Rock. Each one is ostensibly tailored to a specific type of music.
The way to find out whether you prefer using equalization is to listen to 
music while trying out different settings. To do that, first start listening to a 
song you like. Then, while the song is playing, follow these steps:

103
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
 
1. Tap the Home button on the front of your iPhone.
 
2. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
3. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
4. Tap EQ in the list of iPod settings.
 
5. Tap different EQ presets (Pop, Rock, R&B, or Dance, for example) and 
listen carefully to the way it changes how the song sounds.
 
6. When you find an equalizer preset that you think sounds good, tap 
the Home button and you’re finished.
If you don’t like any of the presets, tap Off at the top of the EQ list to turn off 
the equalizer.
Set a volume limit for music (and videos)
You can instruct your iPhone to limit the loudest listening level for audio or 
video. To do so, here’s the drill:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Volume Limit in the list of iPod settings.
 
4. Drag the slider to adjust the maximum volume level to your liking.
 
5. (Optional) Tap Lock Volume Limit to assign a four-digit passcode to 
this setting so that others can’t easily change it.
 
The Volume Limit setting limits the volume of only music and videos. It 
doesn’t apply to podcasts or audiobooks. And, although the setting works 
with any headset, headphones, or speakers plugged into the headset jack on 
your iPhone, it doesn’t affect sound played on your iPhone’s internal speaker.
Enable the Shake to Shuffle option
Shake to Shuffle is a new setting in iPhone OS 3.0 that does just what its name 
implies — shake your iPhone to listen to a different song selected at random. 
To enable this setting, here’s what to do:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap the Shake to Shuffle button to turn the feature on or off.
From shake to shuffle — how can you not love that feature?

104
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Make a playlist on your iPhone
Of course you can make playlists in iTunes and sync them with your iPhone, 
but you can also create playlists on your iPhone when you’re out and about. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the iPod icon in the lower-right corner of the Home screen.
 
2. Tap the Playlists button at the bottom of the screen.
 
3. Tap the first item in the list: On-the-Go.
 
 An alphabetical list of all songs on your iPhone appears. To the right of 
each song is a little plus sign.
 
4. Tap the plus sign next to a song name to add the song to your 
On-the-Go playlist.
 
 To add all these songs to your On-the-Go playlist, tap the plus sign next 
to the first item in the list: Add All Songs.
 
5. Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner.
If you create an On-the-Go playlist and then sync your iPhone with your 
computer, that playlist is saved both on the iPhone and in iTunes on your 
computer. The first time you save a playlist, it’s named On-the-Go 1 automat-
ically. Subsequent lists you create are autonamed On-the-Go 2, On-the-Go 3, 
and so on.
The playlists remain until you delete them from iTunes. To do that, select the 
playlist’s name in the source list and then press Delete or Backspace.
You can also edit your On-the-Go playlist. To do so, tap the Playlists button 
at the bottom of the screen, tap the first item in the list (On-the-Go), and tap 
the Edit button. Then do one of the following:
 
✓ To move a song up or down in the On-the-Go playlist: A little icon with 
three gray bars appears to the right of each song. Drag the icon up to 
move the song higher in the list or drag down to move the song lower in 
the list.
 
✓ To add more songs to the On-the-Go playlist: Tap the plus button in the 
upper-left corner.
 
✓ To delete a song from the On-the-Go playlist: Tap the minus sign to the 
left of the song name. Note that deleting a song from the On-the-Go play-
list doesn’t remove the song from your iPhone.
 
✓ To clear the On-the-Go playlist of all songs: Tap the first item in the list: 
Clear Playlist.
When you finish editing, tap the Done button in the upper-right corner.

105
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
That’s all you have to do to create and manage On-the-Go playlists.
Set a sleep timer
If you like to fall asleep with music playing but don’t want to leave your 
iPhone playing music all night long, you can turn on its sleep timer.
Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the Clock button on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap the Timer icon in the lower-right corner.
 
3. Set the number of hours and minutes you want the iPhone-as-an-iPod 
to play, and then tap the When Timer Ends button.
 
4. Tap the first item in the list: Sleep iPod.
 
5. Tap the Set button in the upper-right corner.
 
6. Tap the big, green Start button.
That’s it! After the appropriate period, your iPod stops playing and your 
iPhone goes to sleep.
Use your voice to control your iPod 
(iPhone 3GS only)
Here’s something cool: If you have an iPhone 3GS, you can boss around your 
music by using nothing but your voice. Here are the things you can say:
 
✓ To play an album, an artist, or a playlist: Say “Play” and then say 
“album,” “artist,” or “playlist” and the name.
 
✓ To shuffle the current playlist: Say “Shuffle.”
 
✓ To find out more about the song that’s playing: Ask “What’s playing?” 
“What song is this?” “Who sings this song?” or “Who is this song by?”
 
✓ To use Genius to play similar songs: Say “Genius,” “Play more like this,” 
or “Play more songs like this.”
And hey, because your iPod happens to be an iPhone, you won’t look stupid 
talking to it!
 
Although we found that controlling your iPod by speaking aloud works most 
of the time, in noisy environments the iPhone may mishear your verbal 
request and start playing the wrong song or artist. Using the wired headset 
helps. And syntax counts, so remember to use the exact wording in the list.

106
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Shopping with the iTunes app
Last but certainly not least, the iTunes application lets you use your iPhone 
to download, buy, or rent just about anything you can download, buy, or rent 
with the iTunes application on your Mac or PC, including music, audiobooks, 
iTunes University classes, podcasts, and videos. And, if you’re fortunate 
enough to have an iTunes gift card or gift certificate in hand, you can redeem 
it directly from your iPhone.
If you want to do any of that, however, you must first sign in to your iTunes 
Store account:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap Store in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Sign In.
 
4. Type your username and password.
Or, in the unlikely event that you don’t have an iTunes Store account already:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap Store in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Create New Account.
 
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
After the iTunes Store knows who you are (and, more importantly, knows 
your credit card number), tap the iTunes icon on your Home screen and 
shop until you drop.

iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
In This Chapter
▶ Finding videos
▶ Playing videos on your iPhone
▶ Shooting video
▶ Editing footage
▶ Screening YouTube
P
icture this scene: The smell of popcorn permeates the room as you and 
your family congregate to watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster. A 
motion picture soundtrack swells up. The images on the screen are stunning. 
And all eyes are fixed on the iPhone.
Okay, here comes the reality check. The iPhone is not going to 
replace a wall-sized high-definition television as the center-
piece of your home theater. But we do want to emphasize 
that with its glorious widescreen 31/2-inch display — the 
best we’ve seen on a handheld device — watching 
movies and other videos on the iPhone can be a 
cinematic delight.
As you’ll discover later in this chapter, if you own 
the iPhone 3GS, you can even shoot your own 
blockbuster footage. Let’s get on with the show!
Finding Stuff to Watch
The video you’ll watch on the iPhone generally falls into one 
of four categories:
 
✓ Movies, TV shows, and music videos that you’ve downloaded directly 
to your iPhone or that reside in iTunes software on your PC or Mac 
that you synchronize with your iPhone. (For more on synchronization, 
refer to Chapter 3.) You can watch these by tapping the iPod icon at the 
bottom of the Home screen and then tapping Videos.

108
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
 Apple’s own iTunes Store features dedicated sections for purchasing 
episodes of TV shows (from The Larry Sanders Show to Dora the 
Explorer) and movies (such as Gran Torino or Enchanted). The typical 
price as of this writing is $1.99 per episode for TV shows and $9.99 to 
$14.99 for feature films.
 
 You can also rent some movies, typically for $2.99 or $3.99. You’ll have 
30 days to begin watching a rented flick, and 24 hours to finish once 
you’ve started. Such films appear in their own Rented Movies section on 
the video list, which you get to by tapping iTunes and then Videos. The 
number of days before your rental expires is displayed.
Are we compatible?
Sidebars in this book are considered optional 
reading, but we secretly hope you’ll digest every 
word because you may discover something, or 
be entertained, or both. But you can safely skip 
the material contained herein — no matter how 
much you want to curry favor with your teachers, 
um, authors.
Still, we present this list of video formats sup-
ported by the iPhone as a courtesy to those 
with geek aspirations (you know who you are). 
And just to point out how absurd the world 
of tech can sound sometimes — even from a 
consumer-friendly company such as Apple — 
we are quoting this passage from Apple’s Web 
site verbatim:
Video formats supported: H.264 video, up to 1.5 
Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, 
Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline 
Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, 
stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; 
H.264 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 
30 frames per second, Baseline Profile up to 
Level 3.0 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 
48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file 
formats; MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 
480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile 
with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo 
audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats.
Got all that? Here’s the takeaway message: 
The iPhone works with a whole bunch of video, 
although not everything you’ll want to watch 
will make it through. And you may not know if 
it will play until you try. Indeed, several Internet 
video standards — notably Adobe Flash, Java, 
Real, and Windows Media Video — were not 
supported when this book was in production. 
And we should probably point out that some 
video that will play on an iPod Classic or iPod 
Nano might not play in the iPhone for technical 
reasons we won’t bore you with right now. (This 
may have changed by the time you read this.)
Then again, with the appropriate utility software, 
you may be able to convert some non-working 
video to an iPhone-friendly format. If something 
doesn’t play now, it may well in the future — 
because Apple has the capability to upgrade 
the iPhone through software.

109
 Chapter 8: iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
 
✓ The boatload of video podcasts, just about all of them free, featured in 
the iTunes Store. Podcasts started out as another form of Internet radio, 
although instead of listening to live streams, you downloaded files onto 
your computer or iPod to take in at your leisure. There are still lots of 
audio podcasts, but the focus here is on video.
 
✓ Homegrown videos from the popular YouTube Internet site. Apple 
obviously thinks highly of YouTube because it devoted a dedicated 
Home screen icon to the site. More on YouTube’s special place in the 
iPhone later in this chapter.
 
✓ The movies you’ve created in iMovie software or other software on 
the Mac or, for that matter, other programs on the PC. Plus all the 
other videos you may have downloaded from the Internet.
 
You may have to prepare these videos so that they’ll play on your iPhone. To 
do so, highlight the video in question after it resides in your iTunes library. 
Go to the Advanced menu in iTunes, and click Convert Selection for iPod/
iPhone.
For more on compatibility, check out the “Are we compatible?” sidebar in 
this chapter (but read it at your own risk).
Playing Video
Now that you know what you want to watch, here’s how to watch it:
 
1. On the Home screen, tap the iPod icon and then tap the Videos icon.
 
 Your list of videos pops up. Videos are segregated by category — 
Movies, TV Shows, Music Videos, as shown in Figure 8-1 — although 
other categories such as Rented Movies and Podcasts may also appear. 
Listings are accompanied by thumbnail images and the length of the 
video.
 
2. Flick your finger to scroll through the list, and then tap the video you 
want to play.
 
 You may see a spinning circle for just a moment and then the video will 
begin. We’ve found that on the truly snappy iPhone 3GS, the video starts 
playing without such a delay.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
 
Figure 8-1: Choosing the video to watch.
 
3. Turn the device to its side because the iPhone plays video only in 
landscape, or widescreen, mode.
 
 For movies, this is a great thing. You can watch flicks as the filmmaker 
intended, in a cinematic aspect ratio.
 
4. Now that the video is playing, tap the screen to display the controls 
shown in Figure 8-2.
 
5. Tap the controls that follow as needed:
 
• To play or pause the video, tap the Play/Pause button.
 
• Drag the volume slider to the right to raise the volume and to the 
left to lower it. Alternatively, use the physical Volume buttons to 
control the audio levels. If the video is oriented properly, the but-
tons will be to the bottom left of the iPhone.
 
• Tap the Restart/Rewind button to restart the video or tap and hold 
the same button to rewind.
 
• Tap and hold Fast Forward to advance the video. Or skip ahead by 
dragging the playhead along the Scrubber bar.

• Tap the Scale button to toggle between filling the entire screen 
with video or fitting the video to the screen. Alternatively, you can 
double-tap the video to go back and forth between fitting and fill-
ing the screen.
 
 Fitting the video to the screen displays the film in its theatrical 
aspect ratio. But you may see black bars above or below the video 
(or to its sides), which some people don’t like. Filling the entire 
screen with the video may crop or trim the sides or top of the pic-
ture, so you aren’t seeing the complete scene that the director shot.
 
6. Tap the screen again to make the controls go away (or just wait for 
them to go away on their own).
 
7. Tap Done when you’ve finished watching. (You have to summon the 
controls back if they’re not already present.)
 
 You return to the iPhone’s video menu screen.

To delete a video manually, swipe left or right over the video listing. Then tap 
the small red Delete button that materializes. To confirm your intention, tap 
the larger Delete button that appears.
 
Sometimes you want to hear a song from a music video but don’t want to 
watch it. Instead of tapping the Videos icon to grab that selection, choose the 
ditty by tapping the Songs or Artists icon instead.
Shooting Video
The 3GS is the first iPhone to let you shoot video. If you bought one, you’ll 
want to read this section to get the most out of the video camera built into 
your handset. If you don’t have one, well we hope you’ll stick with us anyway. 
You might own a 3GS someday, and even if you don’t we kind of like having 
you around.
Here’s how to shoot video on a 3GS phone:
 
1. Tap the Camera icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Drag the little onscreen button at the bottom-right corner of the dis-
play from the camera position to the video camera position, as shown 
in Figure 8-3.
 
3. Tap the red record button on the bottom center to begin shooting a 
scene. You can capture video in portrait or landscape or landscape 
mode.
 
 The button blinks and you see a counter timing the length of your video.
 
4. When you’re done, tap the red button again to stop the recording.
 
 Your video is automatically saved to the camera roll, alongside any 
other saved videos and still pictures.
 
The 3GS shoots VGA video at up to 30 frames-per-second. That’s tech jargon 
for full-motion video, and what it really means is your video won’t be herky-
jerky or look like it was shot in Jell-o. It isn’t high definition, but we think 
you’ll be quite satisfied.
Editing what you shot
We’re going to assume that you captured some really great stuff — as well as 
some footage that belongs on the cutting room floor. That’s not a problem 
because you can perform simple edits right on your iPhone 3GS.

113
 Chapter 8: iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
 
1. Tap a video recording to bring up the onscreen controls shown in 
Figure 8-4.
 
2. Drag the start and end points along the timeline to select only the 
video you want to keep. Hold your finger over the section to expand 
the timeline to make it easier to apply your edits.
 
 You can tap the play button to preview the edit.
 
3. Tap Trim to save your changes
 
Make sure you’re satisfied with your edit before tapping Trim. You can’t 
undo this action once it’s made.

Sharing video
 
 Unlike other video on your iPhone, you can play back what you’ve just shot 
in portrait or landscape mode. And if the video is any good (and why 
wouldn’t it be), you’re likely going to want to share it with others. To do so, 
bring up the playback controls by tapping the screen, and then tap the icon 
all the way to left of the screen (the one with the arrow pointing out to the 
right from a rectangle). You can e-mail the video, send it to Apple’s MobileMe 
service, or send it to YouTube. And speaking of YouTube, read on . . .
Hey You, It’s YouTube
YouTube has come to define video sharing on the Internet. The wildly popu-
lar site, now owned by Google, has become so powerful that American presi-
dential hopefuls and even politicians in other countries campaign and hold 
debates there. As you might imagine, YouTube has also generated contro-
versy. The site has been banned in some foreign countries. And Viacom has 
sued YouTube for more than $1 billion over alleged copyright infringements. 
(Let the lawyers fight over such matters.)
All the while, YouTube staked a humongous claim on mainstream culture. 
That’s because YouTube is, well, about you and us and our pets and so 
on. It is the cyberdestination, as YouTube boldly proclaims, to “Broadcast 
Yourself.”
Apple has afforded YouTube its own cherished icon on the Home screen. 
Many millions of videos are available on the iPhone, nearly the complete 
YouTube catalog.
 
The back catalog of YouTube videos was converted to the H.264 video-
compression standard that the iPhone and the iPod Touch (and another 
Apple product called Apple TV) can recognize.
As with other videos, you can tap the screen when a YouTube video plays to 
bring up hidden video controls. Many of these controls are identical to the 
controls in Figure 8-2. But as Figure 8-5 shows, YouTube displays special con-
trols of its own, notably for adding favorites and sending e-mail links of the 
video you’re watching.

Hunting for YouTube gems
So where exactly do YouTubers find the videos that will offer them a blissful 
respite from their day? By tapping on any of the following:
 
✓ Featured: Videos recommended by YouTube’s own staffers.
 
✓ Most Viewed: What the YouTube community is watching. Tap All to see 
the most watched YouTube videos of all time. Tap Today or This Week 
to check out the videos most currently in vogue.
 
✓ Favorites: After stumbling on a video you like, add it to your Favorites 
by tapping the Favorites control. As part of the 3.0 software upgrade, 
you could log into your YouTube account with your user name and pass-
word to save and sync these favorites.
 
✓ Search: Tap the Search icon, and then tap the blank YouTube search 
field at the top of the screen. Up pops one of the iPhone’s virtual key-
boards. Type a search phrase and then tap the Search button to gener-
ate results. (In Figure 8-6, we typed Steve Jobs.)

116

✓ More: Tapping More leads to more buttons or icons. As in those that 
follow. . . .
 
✓ Most Recent: Newly submitted videos.
 
✓ Top Rated: The people’s choice. YouTube’s audience chooses the best.
 
✓ History: Videos you recently viewed.
 
✓ My Videos: The place for videos you star in.
  
✓ Subscriptions: YouTube channels you subscribe to.
 
✓ Playlists: Videos categorized into playlists show up here
 
Only four YouTube icons (besides the More button) appear at the bottom of 
the screen at any one time. If you’d prefer a different button than one of the 
four shown — Top Rated instead of Favorites, say — you can make it one of 
your Fab Four icons.
To change the icons shown on that first YouTube screen, tap More and then 
tap Edit. Then simply drag your preferred icon (Top Rated in this example) 
over the one you want to relegate to the YouTube bench (Favorites in this 
case). You can also rearrange the order of the icons by dragging them left or 
right.

117
 Chapter 8: iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
While the movie you’ve selected is downloading — and how fast it arrives 
depends on your network coverage from AT&T or Wi-Fi, as discussed in 
greater detail in Chapter 10 — you see a black-and-gray screen with video 
controls and the YouTube logo. This screen is shown in Figure 8-7. The con-
trols disappear when the movie starts playing.
 
 
Figure 8-7: Waiting to be entertained.
Sharing YouTube videos
We were as enthralled as that harshest of critics Simon Cowell was by Paul 
Potts, the British mobile-phone worker turned opera singer. His star turn on 
the American Idol-like Britain’s Got Talent has been immortalized on YouTube 
and watched by millions. Ditto for Susan Boyle. What is it about that show?
You can share a video as you are watching it by tapping the E-mail button 
(refer to Figure 8-5). When you do so, one of the iPhone’s virtual keyboards 
pops up. iPhone has already filled in the e-mail subject line with the name of 
the video. And the body of the message is populated with a link to the video 
on YouTube. All you need to do is fill in the To field with the e-mail address of 
the person you are sending the link to along with any additional comments.
Alternatively, from the list of videos, tap the blue button with the right-
pointing arrow to see all sorts of details on a particular video. You’ll see a 
description of the video, the number of people who viewed it, the date it was 
added, and other information. From there, tap the Share button to bring up 
the e-mail program described in the preceding paragraph.

118
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Restricting YouTube (and other) usage
If you’ve given an iPhone to your kid or someone who works for you, you 
may not want that person spending time watching YouTube videos. You want 
him or her to do something more productive like homework or the quarterly 
budget.
That’s where parental (or might we say “Mean Boss”) restrictions come in. 
Please note that the use of this iron-fist tool can make you really unpopular.
Tap Settings, General, and Restrictions. Then tap Enable Restrictions. You’ll 
be asked to establish or enter a previously established passcode. Twice. 
Having done so, tap YouTube so that the Off button rather than the On 
button is displayed. As part of the iPhone OS 3.0 software upgrade, you could 
also set restrictions based on movie ratings (PG or whatever).
If you made YouTube a no-no, when you return to the Home screen the 
YouTube icon is missing in action. Same goes for any other restricted activi-
ties. To restore YouTube or other privileges, go back into Restrictions, and 
tap Disable Restrictions. You’ll have to reenter your passcode.
 
Restrictions can also be applied to iTunes, Safari, the App Store, Camera, and 
location settings, as you’ll see when we delve into Settings further (see 
Chapter 13).
With that, let’s roll the closing credits to this chapter.

C
amera phones may outsell dedicated digital cameras nowadays, 
but with relatively few exceptions, they’re rather medio-
cre picture takers. Come to think of it, most mobile phones 
don’t show off digital images all that well, either.
Of course, most mobile phones aren’t iPhones.
The device you have recently purchased (or are lust-
ing after) is a spectacular photo viewer. And though 
its built-in digital camera isn’t the one we’d rely on 
for snapping pictures during an African safari or 
even your kid’s fast-paced soccer game, the iPhone 
in your steady hands can produce perfectly accept-
able photos.
Over the next few pages, you discover how best to 
exploit the iPhone’s camera. We then move on to the real 
magic — making the digital photos that reside on the iPhone 
come alive — whether you imported them from your computer or 
captured them with the iPhone’s camera.

120
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Taking Your Best Shot
As with many applications on the iPhone, you find the Camera application 
icon on the Home screen. Unless you moved things around, it’s positioned on 
the upper row of icons, all the way to the right and adjacent to its next of kin, 
the Photos icon. We tap both icons throughout this chapter.
Might as well snap an image now:
 
1. Tap the camera icon on the Home screen.
 
 This tap turns the iPhone into the rough equivalent of a Kodak 
Instamatic, minus the film and flash, of course.
 
2. Keep your eyes fixed on the iPhone display.
 
 The first thing you notice on the screen is something resembling a 
closed camera shutter. But that shutter opens in about a second, reveal-
ing a window into what the camera lens sees. In case you were wonder-
ing, the lens is hiding behind the small foxhole in the upper-left corner 
of the back of the iPhone. (The position of the camera lens is shown in 
Chapter 1, in Figure 1-3.)
 
3. Aim the camera at whatever you want to shoot, using the iPhone’s 
brilliant 31/2-inch display as your viewfinder.
 
 We marvel at the display throughout this book; the Camera application 
gives us another reason to do so.
 
4. When you’re satisfied with what’s in the frame, tap the camera icon at 
the bottom of the screen (see Figure 9-1) to snap the picture.

121
 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
 
 If you’re using a 3GS camera, make sure the switch at the bottom-right 
corner of the screen is set to camera mode rather than video mode. The 
on-screen button is under the little picture of a camera rather than the 
little picture of a video camera.
 
 Be careful. The camera icon is directly above the Home button. We’ve 
seen more than one iPhone user erroneously hit the Home button 
instead.
 
 You’ll experience momentary shutter lag, so be sure to remain still. 
When the shutter reopens, you see the image you just shot, but just for 
a blink. The screen again functions as a viewfinder so that you can cap-
ture your next image.
 
 That’s it: You’ve snapped your first iPhone picture.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to capture additional images.
 
If you position the iPhone sideways while snapping an image, the picture is 
saved in landscape mode.
Keep a couple more things in mind while snapping pictures with the iPhone.
In our experience, the iPhone camera button is supersensitive. We have acci-
dentally taken a few rotten snapshots because of it. Be careful: A gentle tap is 
all that’s required to snap an image.
 
If you have trouble keeping the camera steady, try this trick. Rather than tap 
the camera icon at the bottom of the screen (as suggested in Step 4), keep 
your finger pressed against the icon and release it only when you’re ready to 
snap an image.
Keeping Things in Focus (3GS Only)
If you have the 3GS iPhone, you can take advantage of the new feature 
dubbed Tap to Focus. Normally, the camera on the 3GS focuses on a subject 
in the center of the display, which you’re reminded of when you momen-
tarily see a square appear in the middle of the screen, as shown in Figure 
9-2. But if you tap elsewhere in the frame, perhaps on the face of your kid 
in the background, the iPhone accordingly shifts its focus there, adjusting 
the exposure and the phenomenon that photographers refer to as the white 
balance. For another moment or so, you see a new, smaller square over the 
child’s face.

Importing Pictures
You needn’t use only the iPhone’s digital camera to get pictures onto the 
device, of course, and in most cases, we suspect that you won’t. Instead, you 
can synchronize photos from a PC or Macintosh by using the Photos tab on 
the iTunes iPhone page, which is described in Chapter 3. (The assumption 
here is that you already know how to get pictures onto your computer.)
Quickie reminder: On a Mac, you can sync photos via iPhoto software ver-
sion 4.03 or later and Aperture. On a PC, you can sync with Adobe Photoshop 
Album 2.0 or later and Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 or later. Alternatively, 
with both computers, you can sync with any folder containing pictures.
When the iPhone is connected to your computer, click the Photos tab on 
the iTunes iPhone page. Then click the appropriate check boxes to specify 
the pictures and photos you want to synchronize. Or, choose All Photos and 
Albums if you have enough storage on the iPhone to accommodate them.
Syncing pictures is a two-way process, so photos captured with the iPhone’s 
digital camera can also end up in the photo library on your computer.
 
Mac users: Connecting the iPhone with photos in the camera roll usually 
launches iPhoto in addition to iTunes.

123
 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
Where Have All My Pictures Gone?
So where exactly do your pictures hang out on the iPhone? The ones you 
snapped on the iPhone end up in a photo album appropriately dubbed the 
camera roll. Of course, the photos you imported are readily available too 
(and grouped in the same albums they were on the computer). We show you 
not only where they are but also how to display them and share them with 
others — and how to dispose of the duds that don’t measure up to your lofty 
photographic standards.
Get ready to literally get your fingers on the pics (without having to worry 
about smudging them):
Tasty pixels and other digital camera treats
The original iPhone and the iPhone 3G are 
2-megapixel digital cameras. The iPhone 3GS 
increases that number to 3 megapixels. And, 
if you’ve been shopping for a digital camera of 
any type, you’re already aware that megapixels 
are marketed like chocolate chips: You know, 
the more of them, the tastier the cookie, or (in 
the case of digital photography) the better the 
camera. But that may not always be true. The 
number of megapixels counts, for sure, but so 
do a bevy of other factors — including lens 
quality and shutter lag.
The important thing to remember about mega-
pixels is that they’re a measure of a camera’s 
resolution, or picture sharpness, which becomes 
particularly important to folks who want to blow 
up prints well beyond snapshot size. For exam-
ple, you probably want at least a 4-megapixel 
standalone digital camera if you hope to print 
decent 8-by-10-inch or larger photos.
Which brings us back to the iPhone. From a 
camera-phone perspective, 2 megapixels is 
considered fairly decent, and 3 megapixels is 
even better. But more and more these days, you 
find cell phones with a higher megapixel count. 
Still, we figure that most of you will be more 
than satisfied with the pictures you take with 
the iPhone, as long as you keep your expec-
tations in check and don’t expect to produce 
poster-size images.
We’re obliged to point out, however, that the 
digital camera in the iPhone lacks some features 
found on rival camera phones — notably, a 
flash. And only the 3GS can shoot video. What’s 
more, the iPhone has no advanced photo-
editing features.
Despite all that, those other camera phones 
can’t hold a candle to the iPhone when it comes 
to showing off those images, as the rest of this 
chapter proves. The iPhone’s high-resolution 
480-x-320 screen — yep, it’s measured in 
pixels — is simply stunning.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
1. From the Camera application:
 
a. Tap the Preview icon (refer to Figure 9-1).
 
 The shutter closes for just an instant and is replaced by the last 
image you shot. You see the camera controls shown in Figure 9-3. If 
you don’t see the camera controls (they disappear after a few sec-
onds), tap the screen again.
 
b. Tap the Camera Roll button in the upper-left corner of the 
screen.
 
 You see thumbnail images of the complete roll of pictures you shot 
with the iPhone. The camera roll is displayed in Figure 9-4.
 
 On the 3GS, the camera roll shows photos and videos you’ve shot. 
(The process of shooting videos is described in Chapter 8.) On 
older iPhone models, you see just photos.
 
2. Alternatively, you can tap the Photos icon on the Home screen and 
then tap camera roll or any other album in the list of photo albums.
 
 Using the method described in Step 1, you can access only the camera 
roll. Using the alternative method, you can access the camera roll and 
all your other photo albums.

3. Browse through the thumbnail images in the album until you find the 
picture you want to display.
 
 If the thumbnail you have in mind doesn’t appear on this screen, flick 
your finger up or down to scroll through the pictures rapidly or use a 
slower dragging motion to pore through the images more deliberately.
 
4. Tap the appropriate thumbnail.
 
 The picture you selected fills the entire screen.
 
5. Tap the screen again.
 
 The picture controls appear (refer to Figure 9-3). We discuss later what 
they do.
 
6. To make the controls disappear, tap the screen again or just wait a few 
seconds and they go away on their own.
 
7. To transform the iPhone back into a picture-taker rather than a 
picture-viewer, make sure that the picture controls are displayed and 
then tap Done in the upper-right corner.
 
 Note that this option is available only if you arrived at the camera roll 
from the Camera application. If you didn’t, you have to back out of 
this application altogether by tapping the Home button. Then tap the 
Camera application icon on the Home screen to call the iPhone’s digital 
camera back into duty.
 
8. To return to the thumbnails view of your camera roll or the thumb-
nails for any of your other albums, make sure the picture controls are 
displayed. Then tap the Camera Roll button in the upper-left corner.
 
 The Camera Roll button carries the name of one of your other photo 
albums if you’re trying to return to that collection of pictures instead.
Admiring Pictures
Photographs are meant to be seen, of course, not buried in the digital equiva-
lent of a shoebox. And, the iPhone affords you some neat ways to manipulate, 
view, and share your best photos.
You may already know (from the preceding section) how to find a photo 
and view it full-screen and display picture controls. But you can do a lot of 
maneuvering of your pictures without summoning those controls. Here are 
some options:

126
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
✓ Skip ahead or view the previous picture: Flick your finger left or right, 
or tap the left- or right-arrow control.
 
✓ Landscape or portrait: The iPhone’s wizardry (or, more specifically, the 
device’s accelerometer sensor) is at work. When you turn the iPhone 
sideways, the picture automatically reorients itself from portrait to land-
scape mode, as the images in Figure 9-5 show. Pictures shot in landscape 
mode fill the screen when you rotate the iPhone. Rotate the device back 
to portrait mode and the picture readjusts accordingly.
 
✓ Zoom: Double-tap to zoom in on an image and make it larger. Do 
so again to zoom out and make it smaller. Alternatively, take your 
thumb and index finger and pinch to zoom in, or unpinch the photo 
to zoom out.
 
✓ Pan and scroll: This cool little feature is practically guaranteed to make 
you the life of the party. After you zoom in on a picture, drag it around 
the screen with your finger. Besides impressing your friends, you can 
bring front and center the part of the image you most care about. That 
lets you zoom in on Fido’s adorable face as opposed to, say, the unflat-
tering picture of the person holding the dog in his lap.

 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
Launching Slideshows
Those of us who store a lot of photographs on computers are familiar with 
running slideshows of those images. It’s a breeze to replicate the experience 
on the iPhone:
 
1. Choose your camera roll or another album from the Photo Albums list.
 
 To do so, tap the Photos icon from the Home screen or tap the Camera 
Roll button in the Camera application.
 
2. Tap the Play button at the bottom of the thumbnails screen and you’re 
finished.
Enjoy the show.
Special slideshow effects
You can alter the length of time each slide is shown, change the transition 
effects between pictures, and display images in random order.
From the Home screen, tap Settings and then scroll down and tap Photos. 
Then tap any of the following to make changes:
 
✓ Play Each Slide For: You have five choices (2 seconds, 3 seconds, 5 
seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds). When you’re finished, tap the Photos 
button to return to the main Settings screen for Photos.
 
✓ Transition: This effect is the one you see when you move from one slide 
to the next. Again, you have five choices (cube, dissolve, ripple, wipe 
across, wipe down). Why not try them all, to see what you like? Tap the 
Photos button when you’re finished.
 
✓ Repeat: If this option is turned on, the slideshow continues to loop until 
you stop it. If it’s turned off, the slideshow for your camera roll or album 
plays just once. The Repeat control may be counterintuitive. If Off is 
showing, tap it to turn on the Repeat function. If On is showing, tap it to 
turn off the Repeat function.
 
✓ Shuffle: Turning on this feature plays slides in random order. As with 
the Repeat feature, tap Off to turn on shuffle or tap On to turn off 
random playback.
Tap the Home button to leave the settings and return to the Home screen.

Adding music to your slideshow
Ed loves backing up slideshows with Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, or Gershwin, 
among numerous other artists. Bob loves using Beatles songs or stately 
classical music.
Adding music to a slideshow couldn’t be easier. Just tap iPod and begin play-
ing a song. Then return to the Photo application to start up a slideshow, as 
described in the beginning of the earlier section “Launching Slideshows.”
Deleting pictures
We told a tiny fib by intimating that photographs are meant to be seen. We 
should have amended that statement by saying that some pictures are meant 
to be seen. Others, well . . . you can’t get rid of them fast enough. Fortunately, 
the iPhone makes it a cinch to bury the evidence:
 
1. From the camera roll, tap the objectionable photograph.
 
2. Tap to display the picture controls, if they’re not already displayed.
 
3. Tap the trash can icon.
 
4. Tap Delete Photo (or Cancel, if you change your mind).
 
 The photo gets sucked into the trash can and mercifully disappears.
More (Not So) Stupid Picture Tricks
You can take advantage of the photos on the iPhone in a few more ways. In 
each case, you tap the picture and make sure the picture controls are dis-
played. Then tap the icon at the bottom left (the one that looks like an arrow 
trying to escape from a rectangle). That displays the four choices shown in 
Figure 9-6.
Here’s what each choice does:
 
✓ Use As Wallpaper: The default background image on the iPhone when 
you unlock the device is a gorgeous view of Earth. Dramatic though it 
may be, you probably have an even better photograph to use as the 
iPhone’s wallpaper. A picture of your spouse, your kids, or your pet, 
perhaps?
 
 When you tap the Use As Wallpaper button, you see what the present 
image looks like as the iPhone’s background picture. And, as Figure 9-7 
shows, you’re given the opportunity to move the picture around and 

129
 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
resize it, through the now familiar action of dragging or pinching against 
the screen with your fingers. When you’re satisfied with what the wall-
paper will look like, tap the Set Wallpaper button. Per usual, you also 
have the option to tap Cancel. (You can find out more about wallpaper 
in Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Email Photo: Some photos are so precious that you just have to share 
them with family members and friends. When you tap Email Photo, the 
picture is automatically embedded in the body of an outgoing e-mail 
message. Use the virtual keyboard to enter the e-mail addresses, subject 
line, and any comments you want to add — you know, something pro-
found, like “Isn’t this a great-looking photo?” (Check out Chapter 11 for 
more info on using e-mail.)
 
 You can also press and hold the screen until a Copy button appears. Tap 
that button, and now you can paste the image into an e-mail.
 
 After the 3.0 software upgrade, Apple began supporting picture messag-
ing through what’s called MMS, or Multimedia Messaging Service. As 
this book was being published, AT&T hadn’t flipped the switch on the 
service in the United States, so depending on when you read this book, 
you may not yet be able to take advantage of MMS.

✓ Assign to Contact: If you assign a picture to someone in your Contacts 
list, this image pops up whenever you receive a call from that person. 
To make it happen, tap Assign to Contact. Your list of contacts appears 
on the screen. Scroll up or down the list to find the person who matches 
the picture of the moment. As with the wallpaper example, you can drag 
and resize the picture to get it just right. Then tap Set Photo.
 
 As you may recall from Chapter 4, you can also assign a photo to a con-
tact by starting out in Contacts. As a refresher, start by tapping Phone, 
and then tapping Contacts. From Contacts, choose the person, tap Edit, 
and then tap Add Photo. At that point, you can take a new picture with 
the iPhone’s digital camera or select an existing portrait from one of 
your onboard picture albums.
 
 To change the picture you assigned to a person, tap her name in the 
Contacts list, tap Edit, and then tap the person’s thumbnail picture, 
which also carries the label Edit. From there, you can take another 
photo with the iPhone’s digital camera, select another photo from one of 
your albums, edit the photo you’re already using (by resizing and drag-
ging it to a new position), or delete the photo you no longer want.
 
✓ Send To MobileMe: If you’re a member of Apple’s $99-a-year MobileMe 
online service (formerly .Mac), you can publish a photo to an album in 
the MobileMe Gallery. Tap the Send To MobileMe control, and then tap 
the appropriate Gallery album to which you want to add the picture. 
Enter the title of the photo and an optional description in the spaces 
provided in the Publish Photo screen that pops up. Tap Publish. Your 
photo is on its way to the “cloud.” You also have to check an Album 
Setting box in the Gallery that has a strangely worded label: Adding of 
Photos via E-Mail or iPhone.
 
Before leaving this photography section, we want to steer you to the App 
Store, which we explore in greater depth in Chapter 14. As of this writ-
ing, hundreds of photography-related applications, many free, are avail-
able. These come from a variety of sources and range from Omer Shoor’s 
Photogene (a $2.99 suite of photo-editing tools) to Imaging Luminary’s iFlash 
Ready v2.1 (which attempts to brighten pictures by using a software-based 
flash). We also want to point out that many picture apps take advantage of 
the iPhone’s location smarts. Pictures can be geotagged with the location in 
which they were shot. The first few times you use the iPhone’s Camera appli-
cation, it asks for your permission to use your current location. Similarly, 
third-party apps ask whether it’s okay to use your location. Later on, you 
might plot a picture’s location on a map or use geotagged images to see 
where friends or like-minded individuals are hanging out.
You have just passed Photography 101 on the iPhone. We trust that the 
coursework was a, forgive the pun, snap.

Part IV
The Internet 
iPhone

T
he commercials for the iPhone say that it pro-
vides you with the real Internet — and it does. 
So this part looks at the Internet components of 
your phone, starting with a chapter covering the 
best Web browser ever to grace a handheld 
device, Safari. We reveal how to take advantage of 
links and bookmarks and how to open multiple 
Web pages at the same time. We show you how to 
run a Web search on an iPhone. And we spend 
time discussing EDGE, 3G, and Wi-Fi — the wire-
less networks that are compatible with the device.
Then we visit the Mail program and see how easy 
it is to set up e-mail accounts and send and 
receive real honest-to-goodness e-mail messages 
and attachments.
Finally, we examine four superb Web-enabled 
applications. In Maps and in Compass, you dis-
cover your direction, determine the businesses 
and restaurants you’d like to visit, get driving 
directions and the trafﬁ c en route, and take 
advantage of the iPhone’s capability to ﬁ nd you. 
In Weather, you get the forecast for all the cities 
you live in or plan on visiting. And in Stocks, you 
get the lowdown on how well the equities in your 
portfolio are performing.

“T
he Internet in your pocket.”
That’s what Apple promised the iPhone would bring to the public when the 
product was announced in January 2007. Steve Jobs & Co. has come 
tantalizingly close to delivering on that pledge.
For years, the cell phone industry has been offering some 
sort of watered-down mobile version of the Internet, 
but the approaches have fallen far short of what 
you’ve come to experience while sitting in front 
of a computer.
Apple, however, has managed for the most part 
to replicate the real-deal Internet with the iPhone. 
Web pages look like Web pages on a Windows PC or 
Macintosh, right down to swanky graphics and pic-
tures — and at least some video.
In this chapter, you find out how to navigate through 
cyberspace on your iPhone.

134
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Living on the EDGE
You can’t typically make or receive phone calls 
on a wireless phone without tapping into a cel-
lular network. And, you can’t prowl the virtual 
corridors of cyberspace (or send e-mail) on a 
mobile phone without accessing a wireless 
data network. In the United States, the iPhone 
works with Wi-Fi, AT&T EDGE, and AT&T 3G. (It 
also works with another wireless technology, 
Bluetooth, but that serves a different purpose 
and is addressed in Chapter 13.) The iPhone 
also works with the data network GPRS.
The iPhone automatically hops onto the fast-
est available network, which is almost always 
Wi-Fi, the friendly moniker applied to the far 
geekier 802.11 designation. And “eight-oh-two-
dot-eleven” (as it’s pronounced) is followed by 
a letter — typically (but not always), b, g, or n. 
So you see it written as 802.11b, 802.11g, and 
so on. The letters relate to differing technical 
standards that have to do with the speed and 
range you can expect from the Wi-Fi configu-
ration. But we certainly wouldn’t have you lose 
any sleep over this issue if you haven’t boned up 
on this geeky alphabet.
For the record, because the iPhone adheres to 
802.11b and 802.11g standards, it works with 
most common Internet routers available to the 
masses and most public and private Internet 
hotspots, found at airports, colleges, coffee-
houses, and elsewhere. If you have to pres-
ent a password to take advantage of a for-fee 
hotspot, you can enter it by using the iPhone’s 
virtual keyboard.
The problem with Wi-Fi is that it’s far from ubiq-
uitous, which leads us right back to EDGE or 3G. 
If you’re ever on a million-dollar game show and 
have to answer the question, EDGE is shorthand 
for Enhanced Datarate for GSM Evolution. It’s 
based on the global GSM phone standard.
Meanwhile, 3GStands for third generation; 3G 
Web sites typically download two times faster 
than EDGE, in our experience, and sometimes 
faster than that. But, again, Wi-Fi downloads 
are even zippier.
The bottom line is this: Depending on where 
you live, work, or travel, you may feel like you’re 
teetering on the EDGE in terms of acceptable 
Internet coverage, especially if Wi-Fi or true 3G 
is beyond your reach. We’ve used the iPhone in 
areas where Web pages load extremely slowly, 
not-so-vaguely reminiscent of dialup telephone 
modems for your computer.
You may wonder why Apple and AT&T chose 
EDGE for the iPhone in the first place. One 
reason was that EDGE blanketed a good part of 
the country, whereas the 3G footprint, or cov-
erage area, was far smaller. And, the 3G net-
works also hog more power than EDGE, putting 
a serious crimp on the iPhone’s battery life. Of 
course, Wi-Fi can put strains on a battery too. 
Moreover, 3G networks weren’t standardized 
until well into the iPhone’s development. Even 
now, in our experience, Internet coverage can 
be a bit flaky.
But the picture is brightening. 3G is in more 
places than ever. And, the iPhone 3GS not only 
loads Web pages a lot zippier but also manages 
to do so with a longer-lasting battery.

 Chapter 10: Going on a Mobile Safari
Surfin’ Dude
A version of the Apple Safari Web browser is a major reason that the Net on 
the iPhone is very much like the Net you’ve come to expect on a computer. 
Safari for the Mac, and (more recently) for Windows, is one of the best Web 
browsers in the computer business. In our view, it has no rival as a cell 
phone browser.
Exploring the browser
We start our cyberexpedition with a quick tour of the Safari browser. Take a 
gander at Figure 10-1: Not all browser controls found on a PC or Mac are pres-
ent. Still, Safari on the iPhone has a familiar look and feel. We describe these 
controls and others throughout this chapter.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Before plunging in, we recommend a little detour. Read the “Living on the 
EDGE” sidebar, earlier in this chapter, to find out more about the wireless 
networks that let you surf the Web on the iPhone in the first place.
Blasting off into cyberspace
So we tell you how great Web pages look on the iPhone and you’re eager to 
get going. If you’re reading this chapter from start to finish, we don’t hold 
you back much longer.
When you start by tapping the address field, the virtual keyboard appears. You 
may notice one thing about the keyboard right off the bat: Because so many 
Web addresses end with the suffix .com (pronounced “dot com”), the virtual 
keyboard has a dedicated .com key. For other common Web suffixes — .edu, 
.net, .ee, and .org — press and hold the .com key and choose the relevant 
domain type.
Of equal importance, both the period (.) and the slash (/) are on the virtual 
keyboard because you frequently use them when you enter Web addresses.
The moment you tap a single letter, you see a list of Web addresses that 
match those letters. For example, if you tap the letter E (as we did in the 
example shown in Figure 10-2), you see Web listings for EarthLink, eBay, and 
others. Tapping U or H instead may display listings for USA TODAY or the 
Houston Chronicle (shameless plugs for the newspapers where Ed and Bob 
are columnists).
 
 
Figure 10-2: Web pages that match 
 
your search letter.

137
 Chapter 10: Going on a Mobile Safari
The iPhone has two ways to determine Web sites to suggest when you tap 
certain letters. One method is the Web sites you already bookmarked from 
the Safari or Internet Explorer browsers on your computer (and synchro-
nized, as described in Chapter 3). More on bookmarks later in this chapter.
The second method iPhone uses when suggesting Web sites when you tap a 
particular letter is to suggest sites from the History list — those cyberdesti-
nations where you recently hung your hat. Because history repeats itself, we 
also tackle that topic later in this chapter.
You might as well open your first Web page now — and it’s a full HTML page, 
to borrow from techie lingo:
 
1. Tap the Safari icon at the bottom of the Home screen.
 
 It’s another member of the Fantastic Four (along with Phone, Mail, and 
iPod).
 
2. Tap the address field (refer to Figure 10-1).
 
 If you can’t see the address field, tap the status bar or scroll to the top 
of the screen.
 
3. Begin typing the Web address, or URL (Uniform Resource Locator, for 
trivia buffs), on the virtual keyboard that slides up from the bottom of 
the screen.
 
4. Do one of the following:
 
a. To accept one of the bookmarked (or other) sites that show up on 
the list, merely tap the name.
 
 Safari automatically fills in the URL in the address field and takes 
you where you want to go.
 
b. Keep tapping the proper keyboard characters until you enter the 
complete Web address for the site you have in mind, and then tap 
Go in the lower-right corner of the keyboard.
 
 It’s not necessary to type www at the beginning of a URL. So, if you 
want to visit www.theonion.com (for example), typing theonion.
com is sufficient to transport you to the humor site.
 
Even though Safari on the iPhone can render Web pages the way they’re 
meant to be displayed on a computer, every so often you may run into a site 
that serves up the light, or mobile, version of the Web site, sometimes known 
as a WAP site. Graphics may be stripped down on these sites. Alas, the pro-
ducers of these sites may be unwittingly discriminating against you for drop-
ping in on them by using a cell phone. Never mind that the cell phone in this 
case is an iPhone. You have our permission to berate these site producers 
with letters, e-mails, and phone calls until they get with the program.

138
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
I Can See Clearly Now
If you know how to open a Web page (if you don’t, read the preceding sec-
tion, “Blasting off into cyberspace”), we can show you how radically simple 
it is to zoom in on the pages so that you can read what you want to read and 
see what you want to see, without enlisting a magnifying glass.
Try these neat tricks:
 
✓ Double-tap the screen so that that portion of the text fills up the entire 
screen: It takes just a second before the screen comes into focus. By 
way of example, check out Figure 10-3. It shows two views of the same 
Sports Illustrated Web page. In the first view, you see what the page looks 
like when you first open it. In the second one, you see how the picture 
takes over much more of the screen after you double-tap it. To return to 
the first view, double-tap the screen again.
 
✓ Pinch the page: Sliding your thumb and index finger together and then 
spreading them apart (or as we like to say, unpinching) also zooms in 
and out of a page. Again, wait just a moment for the screen to come into 
focus.
 
✓ Press down on a page and drag it in all directions, or flick through a 
page from top to bottom: You’re panning and scrolling, baby.
 
 
Figure 10-3: Doing a double-tap dance zooms in and out.

139
 Chapter 10: Going on a Mobile Safari
 
✓ Rotate the iPhone to its side: Watch what happens to the White House 
Web site, shown in Figure 10-4. It reorients from portrait to a wide-
screen view. The keyboard is also wider, making it a little easier to enter 
a new URL.
 
 
Figure 10-4: Going wide.
Opening multiple Web pages at a time
When we surf the Web on a desktop PC or laptop, we rarely go to a single 
Web page and call it a day. In fact, we often have multiple Web pages open 
at the same time. Sometimes, it’s because we choose to hop around the Web 
without closing the pages we visit. Sometimes, a link (see the next section) 
automatically opens a new page without shuttering the old one. (If these 
additional pages are advertisements, they aren’t always welcome.)
Safari on the iPhone lets you open multiple pages simultaneously. Tap the 
Pages icon (refer to Figure 10-1), on the right side of the navigation bar at 
the bottom of the screen, and then tap New Page on the screen that pops up 
next. Tap the address field and type a URL for your new page.
The number inside the Pages icon lets you know how many pages are open. 
To see the other open pages, flick your finger to the left or right, as shown in 
Figure 10-5. Tap a page to have it take over the full screen.
To close one of your open Web pages, tap the white X in the red circle, which 
appears in the upper-left corner of each open page.

140
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 
Figure 10-5: All open for business.
Looking at lovable links
Surfing the Web would be a real drag if you had to enter a URL every time 
you want to navigate from one page to another. That’s why bookmarks are so 
useful. And, it’s why handy links are welcome too. Because Safari functions 
on the iPhone the same way browsers work on your PC or Mac, links on the 
iPhone behave much the same way too.
Text links that transport you from one site to another are underlined. Merely 
tap the link to go directly to that site.
But tapping on some other links leads to different outcomes:
 
✓ Open a map: Tapping on a map launches the Google Maps application 
that is, um, addressed in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Prepare an e-mail: Tap an e-mail address and the iPhone opens the 
Mail program (see the next chapter) and prepopulates the To field with 
that address. The virtual keyboard is also summoned so that you can 
add other e-mail addresses and compose a subject line and message. 
This shortcut doesn’t work in all instances in which an e-mail appears 
on the Web.
 
✓ Make a phone call: Tap a phone number embedded in a Web page and 
the iPhone offers to dial it for you. Just tap Call to make it happen, or tap 
Cancel to forget the whole thing.

141
 Chapter 10: Going on a Mobile Safari
 
To see the URL for a link, press your finger against the link and keep it there. 
Use this method also to determine whether a picture has a link.
 
Not every Web link cooperates with the iPhone. As of this writing, the iPhone 
didn’t support some common Web standards — notably, Adobe Flash video 
and Java. It’s a void that we hope is addressed — and Apple can apply this 
type of upgrade (if it so chooses) by distributing a software update. With OS 
3.0 software, Apple added support for the emerging standard HTML 5 and 
HTTP streaming of audio and video. In the meantime, if you see an incompati-
ble link, nothing may happen — or a message may be displayed about having 
to install a plug-in.
Book(mark) ’em, Dano
You already know how useful bookmarks are and how you can synchronize 
bookmarks from the browsers on your computer. It’s equally simple to book-
mark a Web page directly on the iPhone:
 
1. Make sure that the page you want to bookmark is open, and tap the + 
symbol in the bottom middle area of the screen.
 
 You have the opportunity to tap Add Bookmark, Add to Home Screen, 
or Mail Link to this Page. Figure 10-6 shows the Add Bookmark screen, 
which appears when you tap Add Bookmark. The screen arrives with a 
default name and folder location.
 
 
Figure 10-6: Turning into a bookie.

142
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
2. To accept the default bookmark name and default bookmark folder, 
tap Save.
 
3. To change the default bookmark name, tap the X in the circle next to 
the name, enter the new title (using the virtual keyboard), and then 
tap Save.
 
4. To change the location where the bookmark is saved, tap the > symbol 
in the Bookmarks field, tap the folder where you want the bookmark 
kept, tap the Add Bookmark button in the upper-left corner of the 
screen, and then tap Save.
To open a bookmarked page after you set it up, tap the Bookmarks icon at 
the bottom of the screen (refer to Figure 10-1) and then tap the appropriate 
bookmark.
If the bookmark you have in mind is buried inside a folder, tap the folder 
name first, and then tap the bookmark you want.
 
If you tapped Add to Home Screen rather than the Add Bookmark option in 
Step 1 of the preceding set of steps, your iPhone adds an icon to your Home 
screen to let you quickly access the site. If you tapped Mail Link to this Page 
instead, the Mail program opens, with a link for the page in the message and 
the name of the site in the subject line.
Altering bookmarks
If a bookmarked site is no longer meaningful, you can change it or get rid of it:
 
✓ To remove a bookmark (or folder), tap the Bookmarks icon and then tap 
Edit. Tap the red circle next to the bookmark you want to toss off the 
list, and then tap Delete.
 
✓ To change a bookmark name or location, tap Edit and then tap the book-
mark. The Edit Bookmark screen appears, showing the name, URL, and 
location of the bookmark already filled in. Tap the fields you want to 
change. In the Name field, tap the X in the gray circle and then use the 
keyboard to enter a new title. In the Location field, tap the > symbol and 
scroll up or down the list until you find a new home for your bookmark.
 
✓ To create a new folder for your bookmarks, tap Edit and then tap the 
New Folder button. Enter the name of the new folder and choose where 
to put it.
 
✓ To move a bookmark up or down on a list, tap Edit and then drag the 
three bars to the right of the bookmark’s name.

143
 Chapter 10: Going on a Mobile Safari
Letting History repeat itself
Sometimes, you want to revisit a site that you failed to bookmark, but you 
can’t remember the darn destination or what led you there in the first place. 
Good thing you can study the history books.
Safari records the pages you visit and keeps the logs on hand for several 
days. Tap the Bookmarks icon, tap History, and then tap the day you think 
you hung out at the site. When you find it, tap the listing. You’re about to 
make your triumphant return.
 
To clear your history so that nobody else can trace your steps — and just 
what is it you’re hiding, hmm? — tap Clear at the bottom of the History list. 
Alternatively, tap Settings on the Home page, tap Safari, and then tap Clear 
History. In both instances, per usual, you have a chance to back out without 
wiping the slate clean.
Launching a mobile search mission
Most of us spend a lot of time using search engines on the Internet. And, the 
search engines we summon most often are Google and Yahoo! So it goes on 
the iPhone.
Although you can certainly use the virtual keyboard to type google.com 
or yahoo.com in the Safari address field, Apple doesn’t require that tedious 
effort. Instead, you tap into Google or Yahoo! by using the dedicated search 
box shown in Figure 10-7. The default search engine of choice on the iPhone 
is Google, and Yahoo! is the first runner-up.
To conduct a Web search on the iPhone, tap the search field shown earlier, 
in Figure 10-1. The field expands and temporarily replaces the address bar 
at the top of the screen, and the virtual keyboard slides up from the bottom. 
Enter your search term or phrase, and then tap the Google (or Yahoo!) 
button in the lower-right corner of the keyboard to generate pages of results. 
Tap any search results that look promising.
 
To switch the search box from Google to Yahoo! and vice versa, tap Settings 
on the Home page, scroll down and tap Safari, tap Search Engine, and then 
tap to choose one search behemoth over the other.
Saving Web pictures
You can capture most pictures you come across on a Web site — but be 
mindful of any potential copyright violations, depending on what you plan 
to do with the image. To copy an image from a Web site, press your finger 

144
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
against the image and tap the Save Image button that slides up (along with a 
Cancel button and a Copy button), as shown in Figure 10-8. Saved images end 
up in your Camera Roll, from which they can be synced back to a computer. 
If you tap Copy instead, you can paste the image into an e-mail or as a link in 
a program such as Notes.

Smart Safari Settings
Along with the riches galore found on the Internet are places in cyberspace 
where you’re hassled. You might want to take pains to protect your privacy 
and maintain your security.
Return with us now to Settings, by tapping the Settings icon on the Home 
page. Now tap Safari.
You may have already discovered how to change the default search engine 
and clear the record of the sites you visited through Settings. Now see what 
else you can do:

145
 Chapter 10: Going on a Mobile Safari
 
✓ Fill out forms with AutoFill: This capability arrived with OS 3.0 soft-
ware. When AutoFill is turned on, Safari can automatically fill out Web 
forms by using your personal contact information, usernames and pass-
words, or information from other contacts in your address book.
 
✓ Clear cookies: We’re not talking about crumbs you may have acciden-
tally dropped on the iPhone. Cookies are tiny bits of information that a 
Web site places on the iPhone when you visit so that the Web site recog-
nizes you when you return. You need not assume the worst: Most cook-
ies are benign.
 
 If this concept wigs you out, you can take action: Tap Clear Cookies at 
the bottom of the screen and then tap it again (rather than tap Cancel). 
Separately, tap Accept Cookies and then tap Never. Theoretically, you 
will never again receive cookies on the IPhone. A good middle ground 
is to accept cookies only from the sites you visit. To do so, tap From 
Visited. You can also tap Always to accept cookies from all sites.
 
 If you don’t set the iPhone to accept cookies, certain Web pages don’t 
load properly.
 
 Tap Safari to return to the main Safari settings page.
 
✓ Clear the cache: The cache stores content from some Web pages so that 
they load faster the next time you stop by. Tap Clear Cache and then tap 
Clear Cache again on the next screen to (you guessed it) clear the cache.
 
✓ Turn JavaScript on or off: This setting is on when the blue On button 
is showing and off when the white Off button is showing. Programmers 
use JavaScript to add various kinds of functionality to Web pages, from 
displaying the date and time to changing images when you mouse over 
them. However, some security risks have also been associated with 
JavaScript.
 
✓ Turn plug-ins on or off: These are typically associated with certain 
types of video.
 
✓ Block pop-ups: Pop-ups are those Web pages that show up whether 
you want them to or not. Often, they’re annoying advertisements. But 
at some sites, you welcome the appearance of pop-ups, so remember to 
turn off blocking under such circumstances.
 
✓ Use Developer: Unless you happen to be a developer, we don’t ask you 
to pay much attention to this setting. It lets you turn a debug console 
(showing errors, warnings, tips, logs, and similar details that developers 
find useful) on or off.
Taming Safari is just the start of exploiting the Internet on the iPhone. In 
upcoming chapters, you discover how to master e-mail, maps, and more.

The E-Mail Must Get Through
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up your accounts
▶ Sending e-mail messages
▶ Reading and managing e-mail messages
▶ Searching for e-mail messages
▶ Setting e-mail preferences
C
hapter 5 shows you how well your iPhone sends SMS text messages. 
But SMS text messages aren’t the iPhone’s only written communication 
trick, not by a long shot. One of the niftiest things your iPhone can do is send 
and receive real, honest-to-gosh e-mail, using Mail, its modern e-mail applica-
tion. It’s designed not only to send and receive text e-mail messages 
but also to handle rich HTML e-mail messages — formatted 
e-mail messages complete with font and type styles and 
embedded graphics.
Furthermore, your iPhone can read several types of 
file attachments, including PDF, Microsoft Word, 
PowerPoint, and Excel documents, as well as stuff 
produced through Apple’s own iWork software. 
Better still, all this sending and receiving of text, 
graphics, and documents can happen in the back-
ground so that you can surf the Web or talk to a 
friend while your iPhone quietly and efficiently 
handles your e-mail behind the scenes.
Prep Work: Setting Up Your Accounts
First things first. To use Mail, you need an e-mail address. If you have 
broadband Internet access (that is, a cable modem or DSL), you probably 
received one or more e-mail addresses when you signed up. If you’re one of 
the handful of readers who doesn’t already have an e-mail account, you can 

148
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
get one for free from Yahoo! (http://mail.yahoo.com), Google (http://
mail.google.com), or AOL (http://www.aol.com) or from one of many 
other service providers.
 
Many (if not all) free e-mail providers add a small bit of advertising at the end 
of your outgoing messages. If you’d rather not be a billboard for your e-mail 
provider, either use the address(es) that came with your broadband Internet 
access (yourname@comcast.net or yourname@att.net, for example) or pay a 
few dollars a month for a premium e-mail account that doesn’t tack adver-
tising (or anything else) onto your messages. You can get a me.com e-mail 
account as part of Apple’s $99-a-year MobileMe service.
Set up your account the easy way
Chapter 3 explains the option of automatically syncing the e-mail accounts 
on your computer with your iPhone. If you chose that option, your e-mail 
accounts should be configured on your iPhone already. You may proceed 
directly to the later section “Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail).”
If you haven’t yet chosen that option but want to set up your account the 
easy way now, go to Chapter 3 and read that section, sync your iPhone, and 
then you, too, can proceed directly to the “Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail)” 
section.
Set up your account the less easy way
If you don’t want to sync the e-mail accounts on your computer, you can set 
up an e-mail account on your iPhone manually. It’s not quite as easy as click-
ing a box and syncing your iPhone, but it’s not rocket science either.
If you have no e-mail accounts on your iPhone, the first time you launch 
Mail, you’re walked through the following procedure. If you have one or 
more e-mail accounts on your iPhone already and want to add a new account 
manually, start by tapping Settings on the Home screen, and then tap Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars, and Add Account.
Either way, you should now be staring at the Add Account screen, shown 
in Figure 11-1. Proceed to one of the next two sections, depending on your 
e-mail account.
Setting up an e-mail account with Yahoo!, Google, AOL, or MobileMe
If your account is with Yahoo!, Google (Gmail), AOL, or Apple’s own 
MobileMe service, tap the appropriate button on the Add Account screen 
now. If your account is with a provider other than one of these four, tap 

149
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
the Other button and skip ahead to the next section — that is, with one 
important exception. If you’re setting up company e-mail through Microsoft 
Exchange, skip the next section and read the one after that.
Enter your name, e-mail address, and password, as shown in Figure 11-2. You 
can describe this account (such as Work or Personal), but the field tends to 
fill in automatically with the same contents in the Address field unless you 
tell it differently.

Save, and you’re ready to rock.
Tap the Save button in the upper-right corner of the screen. You’re finished. 
That’s all there is to setting up your account.
Setting up an account with another provider
If your e-mail account is with a provider other than Yahoo!, Google, AOL, or 
MobileMe, you have a bit more work ahead of you. You’re going to need a 
bunch of information about your e-mail account that you may not know or 
have handy.

150
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
We suggest that you scan the following instructions, note the items you don’t 
know, and go find the answers before you continue. To find the answers, 
look at the documentation you received when you signed up for your e-mail 
account or visit the account provider’s Web site and search there.
Here’s how you set up an account:
 
1. On the Add Account screen, tap the Other button.
 
2. Under Mail, tap Add Mail Account. Fill in the name, address, pass-
word, and description in the appropriate fields, the same as if you 
were setting up a Yahoo!, Gmail, AOL, or MobileMe account. Tap Save.
 
 With any luck, that’s all you’ll have to do, although you may have to 
endure a spinning cursor for awhile as the iPhone attempts to retrieve 
information and validate your account with your provider. Otherwise, 
continue with Step 3.
 
3. Tap the button at the top of the screen that denotes the type of e-mail 
server this account uses: IMAP or POP, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
4. Fill in the Internet host name for your incoming mail server, which 
should look something like mail.providername.com.
 
 
Figure 11-3: If you’re not a Yahoo!, 
 
Google, AOL, or MobileMe user, you 
 
may have a few more fields to fill in 
 
before you can rock.

151
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
 
5. Fill in your username and password.
 
6. Enter the Internet host name for your outgoing mail server, which 
should look something like smtp.providername.com.
 
 You may have to scroll down to the bottom of the screen to see the out-
going mail server fields.
 
7. Enter your username and password in the appropriate fields.
 
8. Tap the Save button in the upper-right corner to create the account.
 
Some outgoing mail servers don’t need your username and password. The 
fields for these items on your iPhone note that they’re optional. Still, we sug-
gest that you fill them in anyway. It saves you from having to add them later 
if your outgoing mail server does require an account name and password, 
which many do these days.
Set up corporate e-mail
The iPhone has gotten a lot friendlier for business users of late, notably 
because the device makes nice with the Microsoft Exchange servers that are 
a staple in large enterprises.
What’s more, if your company supports something known as Microsoft 
Exchange ActiveSync, you can exploit push e-mail so that messages arrive 
pronto on the iPhone, just as they do on your other computers. (To keep 
everything up to date, the iPhone also supports push calendars and push 
contacts.) For push to work, your company must be simpatico with Microsoft 
Exchange ActiveSync 2003 (Service Pack 2) or 2007 (Service Pack 1). Ask your 
company’s IT or tech department if you run into an issue.
Setting up Exchange e-mail isn’t particularly taxing, and the iPhone connects 
to Exchange right out of the box. There’s still a decent chance that you have 
to consult your employer’s techie-types for certain settings.
Start out by just touching the Microsoft Exchange icon on the Add Account 
screen. Fill in what you can: your e-mail address, username (usually as 
domain\user), and password. Or, call on your IT staff for assistance.
On the next screen, shown in Figure 11-4, enter the Server address, assuming 
that the Microsoft Autodiscovery service didn’t already find it. That address 
usually begins with exchange.company.com.
 
The company you work for doesn’t want just anybody having access to 
your e-mail — heaven forbid if your phone is lost or stolen. So your bosses 
may insist that you change the passcode lock inside Settings on the phone. 
(This is different from the password for your e-mail account.) Skip over to 

152
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Chapter 13 to find instructions for adding or changing a passcode. (We’ll 
wait for you.) And, if your iPhone ends up in the wrong hands, your com-
pany can remotely wipe the contents clean.
After your corporate account is fully configured, you have to choose which 
information you want to synchronize through Exchange. You can choose 
Mail, Contacts, and Calendars. Tap each one that you want to synchronize 
through Microsoft Exchange. After you choose an item, you see the blue On 
button next to it, as shown in Figure 11-5.
 
 
 
Figure 11-4: You’re on your way to a  
Figure 11-5: Keeping Mail, Contacts, 
 
corporate e-mail account.  
and Calendars in sync.
 
By default, the iPhone keeps e-mail synchronized for three days. To sync for 
a longer period, head to Settings and tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then 
tap the Mail account using ActiveSync. Tap Mail Days to Sync and tap No 
Limit or pick another time frame (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month).
 
Sorry, but if you’re moonlighting at a second job, you can configure only one 
Exchange ActiveSync account per iPhone. If you tap Microsoft Exchange on 
the Add Account screen of an iPhone that already has an ActiveSync account 
set up, you get no further.

153
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail)
Now that your account or accounts are set up, let’s look at how to use your 
iPhone to send e-mail.
Makin’ messages
You see several subspecies of messages: pure text, text with a photo, a par-
tially finished message (a draft) that you want to save and complete later, a 
reply to an incoming message, and forwarding an incoming message to some-
one else, for example. The following sections examine these subsets one at a 
time.
Sending an all-text message
To compose a new e-mail message, tap Mail on the Home screen. You should 
see a screen that looks pretty much like the one shown in Figure 11-6. Don’t 
worry if yours doesn’t look exactly like this or if your folders have different 
names.
Now, to create a new message, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the New Message button (refer to Figure 11-6) in the lower-right 
corner of the screen.
 
 A screen like the one shown in Figure 11-7 appears.
 
2. Type the names or e-mail addresses of the recipients in the To field or 
tap the + button to the right of the To field to choose a contact or con-
tacts from your iPhone’s address book.
 
3. (Optional) Tap the field labeled Cc/Bcc/From:. Doing so breaks them 
out into separate Cc, Bcc, and From fields. The Cc/Bcc label stands for 
carbon copy/blind carbon copy. If you haven’t used Bcc, it enables you 
to include a recipient on the message that other recipients can’t see has 
been included. It’s great for those secret agent e-mails! Tap the respec-
tive Cc or Bcc field to type names. Or, tap the + symbol that appears in 
those fields to add a contact. If you tap From instead, you can choose to 
send the message from any of your e-mail accounts on the fly, assuming, 
of course, that you have more than one account.
 
 If you start typing an e-mail address, e-mail addresses that match what 
you typed appear in a list below the To or Cc field. If the correct one is 
in the list, tap it to use it.

4. Type a subject in the Subject field.
 
 The subject is optional, but it’s considered poor form to send an e-mail 
message without one.
 
5. Type your message in the message area.
 
 The message area is immediately below the Subject field.
 
6. Tap the Send button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Your message wings its way to its recipients almost immediately. If you aren’t 
in range of a Wi-Fi network or the AT&T EDGE or 3G data network when you 
tap Send, the message is sent the next time you’re in range of one of these 
networks.

155
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
 
Apple added a bunch of landscape orientation keyboards to various applica-
tions, including Mail. When you rotate the phone to its side, you can com-
pose a new message using a wider-format virtual keyboard.
Sending a photo with a text message
Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. When that’s the case, here’s 
how to send an e-mail message with a photo enclosed.
Tap the Photos icon on the Home screen, and then find the photo you want 
to send. Tap the button that looks like a little rectangle with a curved arrow 
springing out of it in the lower-left corner of the screen, and then tap the 
Email Photo button.
An e-mail message appears onscreen with the photo already attached; in fact, 
the image appears to be embedded in the body of the message but the recipi-
ent receives it as a regular e-mail attachment. Just address the message and 
type whatever text you like, as you did for an all-text message in the preced-
ing section, and then tap the Send button.
Saving an e-mail message so that you can send it later
Sometimes you start an e-mail message but don’t have time to finish it. When 
that happens, you can save it as a draft and finish it some other time.
Here’s how: Start an e-mail message as described in one of the two previous 
sections. When you’re ready to save the message as a draft, tap the Cancel 
button in the upper-left corner of the screen. Tap the Save button if you want 
to save this message as a draft and complete it another time. If you tap the 
Cancel button, you cancel the Cancel command and return to the message 
and can continue working on it now.
 
If you tap the Don’t Save button, the message disappears immediately with-
out a second chance. Don’t tap Don’t Save unless you mean it.
To work on the message again, tap the Drafts mailbox. A list of all messages 
you saved as drafts appears. Tap the one you want to work on, and it reap-
pears on the screen. When you’re finished, you can tap Send to send it or tap 
Cancel to save it as a draft again.
 
The number of drafts appears to the right of the Drafts folder, the same way 
that the number of unread messages appears to the right of other mail fold-
ers, such as your Inbox.

156
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Replying to or forwarding an e-mail message
When you receive a message and want to reply to it, open the message and 
then tap the Reply/Reply All/Forward button, which looks like a curved arrow 
at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 11-8. Then tap the Reply, 
Reply All, or Forward button.
 
Next Message
Previous Message
Check for New Messages
File Message
Delete Message
Reply/Reply All/Forward

Figure 11-8: Reading and managing 
 
an e-mail message.
The Reply button creates a blank e-mail message addressed to the sender of 
the original message. The Reply All button creates a blank e-mail message 
addressed to the sender and all other recipients of the original message. In 
both cases, the subject is retained with a Re: prefix added. So if the original 
subject were iPhone Tips, the reply’s subject would be Re: iPhone Tips.

157
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
Tapping the Forward button creates an unaddressed e-mail message that 
contains the text of the original message. Add the e-mail address(es) of the 
person or people you want to forward the message to, and then tap Send. In 
this case, rather than a Re: prefix, the subject is preceded by Fwd:. So this 
time the subject is Fwd: iPhone Tips.
 
You can edit the subject line of a reply or a forwarded message or edit the 
body text of a forwarded message the same way you would edit any other 
text. It’s usually considered good form to leave the subject lines alone (with 
the Re: or Fwd: prefix intact), but you may want to change them sometimes. 
Now you know that you can.
To send your reply or forwarded message, tap the Send button as usual.
Settings for sending e-mail
You can customize the mail you send and receive in lots of different ways. 
In this section, we explore settings for sending e-mail. Later in this chapter, 
we show you settings that impact the way you receive and read messages. In 
each instance, you start by tapping Settings on the Home screen. Then:
 
✓ To hear an alert when you successfully send a message: Tap the Sound 
icon on the main Settings screen, and then turn on the Sent Mail set-
ting. If you want to change other settings, tap the Settings button in the 
upper-left corner of the screen. If you’re finished setting settings, tap the 
Home button on the front of your iPhone.
 
 The preceding paragraph is similar for all the settings we discuss in 
this section and later sections, so we don’t repeat them again. To sum-
marize, if you want to continue using settings, you tap whichever button 
appears in the upper-left corner of the screen — sometimes it’s named 
Settings or Mail or Accounts or something else. The point is that the 
upper-left button always returns you to the previous screen so that you 
can change other settings. The same concept applies to pressing the 
Home button on the front of your iPhone when you’re finished setting a 
setting. That action always saves the change you just made and returns 
you to the Home screen.
 
✓ To add a signature line, phrase, or block of text to every e-mail mes-
sage you send: Tap Settings; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and then tap 
Signature. (You may need to scroll down to see it). The default signature 
is Sent from my iPhone. You can add text before or after it, or delete it 
and type something else. Your signature is now affixed to the end of all 
your outgoing e-mail.
 
✓ To have your iPhone send you a copy of every message you send: Tap 
Settings; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and then turn on the Always Bcc 
Myself setting.

158
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
✓ To set the default e-mail account for sending e-mail from outside the 
Mail application: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, 
and then tap Default Account. Tap the account you want to use as the 
default. For example, when you want to e-mail a picture directly from 
the Photos application, this designated e-mail account is the one that’s 
used. Note that this setting applies only if you have more than one 
e-mail account on your iPhone.
That’s what you need to know about the settings that apply to sending e-mail.
See Me, Read Me, File Me, Delete Me: 
Working with Messages
The first half of the mail equation is sending mail, of course. Now it’s time for 
the second half — receiving and reading the stuff. Fortunately, you’ve already 
done most of the heavy lifting when you set up your e-mail accounts. Getting 
and reading your mail is a piece of cake.
You can tell when you have unread mail by looking at the Mail icon, at the 
bottom of your Home screen. The cumulative number of unread messages 
appears in a little red circle in the upper-right area of the icon.
Reading messages
To read your mail, tap the Mail icon on the Home screen. The Accounts list 
appears, and the Inbox in that list displays the number of unread messages in 
a blue oval to the right of its name.
 
If you have more than one e-mail account, you may have to tap the Accounts 
button in the upper-left corner and then choose the appropriate e-mail 
account before you see the Inbox with the unread messages.
To see the list of unread messages, tap Inbox in the list of mailboxes and then 
tap a message to read it. When a message is on the screen, buttons for man-
aging incoming messages appear below it (refer to Figure 11-8).
Managing messages
When a message is on your screen, you can do the following in addition to 
reading it (all buttons are labeled in Figure 11-8):
 
✓ View the next message by tapping the Next Message arrow at the upper-
right corner of the screen (it’s the upward-pointing arrow).
 
✓ View the previous message by tapping the Previous Message arrow (the 
one pointing downward).

159
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
 
✓ Check for new messages by tapping the Check for New Messages icon.
 
✓ File this message in another folder by tapping the File Message icon. 
When the list of folders appears, tap the folder where you want to file 
the message.
 
✓ Delete this message by tapping the Delete Message icon. You have a 
chance to cancel in case you tap the Delete Message icon by mistake.
 
✓ Reply, reply to all, or forward this message (as discussed previously) by 
tapping the Reply/Reply All/Forward icon.
 
✓ Create a new e-mail message by tapping the New Message icon.
You can delete e-mail messages without opening them in two ways:
 
✓ Swipe left or right across the message and then tap the red Delete 
button that appears to the right of the message.
 
✓ Tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the screen, and tap the 
little circle to the left of each message you want to remove. Tapping that 
circle puts a check mark in it and brightens the red Delete button at the 
bottom of the screen. Tap that Delete button to erase all messages you 
checked off, as shown in Figure 11-9. Deleted messages are moved to the 
Trash folder.
 
 
Figure 11-9: Wiping out or moving 
 
messages, en masse.

160
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Searching e-mails
With the arrival of Spotlight search as part of the 3.0 software upgrade, you 
can easily search through a bunch of messages to find the one you want to 
read fast — such as that can’t-miss stock tip from your broker. Tap the status 
bar to scroll through the top of the inbox. You can type stock or whichever 
search term seems relevant. All matching e-mails that have already been 
downloaded appear. Or, by tapping in the search box itself, you can display 
tabs that let you narrow the search to the From, To, or Subject fields. It’s too 
bad that (at press time, anyway) you can’t run a search to find words within 
the body of an e-mail message.
 
If you’re using Exchange, MobileMe, or certain IMAP-type e-mail accounts, 
you may even be able to search messages that are stored out on the server. 
When available, tap Continue Search on Server.
 
As we just pointed out, you can delete messages in bulk. In much the same 
way, you can move them to another folder in bulk. Again, tap Edit and then tap 
the circle to the left of each message you want to move so that a check mark 
appears. Tap the Move button at the bottom of the screen (refer to Figure 
11-9), and tap the new folder in which you want those messages to hang out.
Don’t grow too attached to attachments
Your iPhone can even receive e-mail messages with attachments in a wide 
variety of file formats. Which file formats does the iPhone support? Glad 
you asked.
Here’s the list of file formats that your iPhone can receive as attachments, 
care of Apple:
 
✓ Images: .jpg, .tiff, .gif
 
✓ Microsoft Word: .doc, .docx
 
✓ Microsoft PowerPoint: .ppt, .pptx
 
✓ Microsoft Excel: .xls, .xlsx
 
✓ Web pages: .htm, .html
 
✓ Apple Keynote: .key
 
✓ Apple Numbers: .numbers
 
✓ Apple Pages: .pages
 
✓ Preview and Adobe Acrobat: .pdf
 
✓ Rich Text: .rtf

161
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
 
✓ Text: .txt
 
✓ Contact information: .vcf
 
If the attachment is a file format not supported by the iPhone (for example, a 
Photoshop .psd file), you see the name of the file but you can’t open it on 
your iPhone.
Here’s how to read an attachment:
 
1. Open the mail message containing the attachment.
 
2. Tap the attachment (it appears at the bottom of the message, so you 
probably need to scroll down to see it).
 
 The attachment, like the one shown in Figure 11-10, downloads to your 
iPhone and opens automatically.
 
 
Figure 11-10: Text from a Microsoft 
 
Word file that was attached to an 
 
incoming e-mail message.
 
3. Read the attachment.
 
4. Tap the Message button in the upper-left corner of the screen to return 
to the message text.

162
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
More things you can do with messages
Wait! You can do even more with your incoming e-mail messages:
 
✓ To see all recipients of a message, tap the word Details (displayed in 
blue) to the right of the sender’s name.
 
 If all recipients are displayed, the word in blue is Hide rather than 
Details. Tap it to hide all names except the sender’s.
 
✓ To add an e-mail recipient or sender to your contacts, tap the name or 
e-mail address at the top of the message and then tap either Create New 
Contact or Add to Existing Contact.
 
✓ To mark a message as unread, tap Mark As Unread, which appears near 
the top of each message in blue with a blue dot to its left. When you do, 
the message is again included in the unread message count on the Mail 
icon on your Home screen, and its mailbox again has a blue dot next to 
it in the message list for that mailbox.
 
✓ To zoom in and out of a message, employ the pinch and unpinch ges-
tures, which we suspect you excel at now.
 
✓ To follow a link in a message, tap the link. Links are typically displayed 
in blue. If the link is a URL, Safari opens and displays the Web page. If 
the link is a phone number, the Phone application opens and offers to 
dial the number. If the link is a map, Maps opens and displays the loca-
tion. And, last but not least, if the link is an e-mail address, a new pread-
dressed blank e-mail message is created.
 
 If the link opens Safari, Phone, or Maps and you want to return to your 
e-mail, press the Home button on the front of your iPhone and then tap 
the Mail icon.
Setting your message and account settings
This final discussion of Mail involves more settings that deal with your vari-
ous e-mail accounts.
Checking and viewing e-mail settings
Several settings affect the way you can check and view e-mail. You might 
want to modify one or more, so we describe what they do and where to find 
them:
 
✓ To specify how often the iPhone checks for new messages: Tap the 
Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and 
then tap Fetch New Data. You’re entering the world of fetching or push-
ing. Check out Figure 11-11 to glance at your options. If your e-mail 
program supports push and you have it turned on (the On button is 

163
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
showing), fresh messages are sent to your iPhone automatically as soon 
as they hit the server. If you turned off push (Off is showing) or your 
e-mail program doesn’t support it in the first place, the iPhone fetches 
data instead. Choices for fetching are Manually, Every 15 Minutes, Every 
30 Minutes, and Hourly. Tap the one you prefer.
 
 Tap Advanced at the bottom of the screen (it’s not visible in Figure 
11-11) to determine these push and fetch settings for each individual 
account. Tap the account in question. Push is shown as an option only if 
the e-mail account you tapped supports the feature.
 
 As of this writing, Yahoo!, MobileMe (Me.com), and Microsoft Exchange 
ActiveSync accounts were awfully pushy (but only in a good way).
 
✓ To hear an alert sound when you receive a new message: Tap the 
Sounds icon on the main Settings screen and then turn on the New Mail 
setting.
 
✓ To set the number of recent messages that appear in your Inbox: Tap 
the Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; 
and then tap Show. Your choices are 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 recent mes-
sages. Tap the number you prefer.
 
 You can always see more messages in your Inbox regardless of this set-
ting by scrolling all the way to the bottom and tapping Download More.
 
 
Figure 11-11: Fetch or push? Your call.

164
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
✓ To set the number of lines of each message to be displayed in the mes-
sage list: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars; tap Preview; and then choose a number. Your choices are 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lines of text. The more lines of text you display in the list, 
the fewer messages you can see at a time without scrolling. Think before 
you choose 4 or 5.
 
✓ To set the font size for messages: Tap the Settings icon on the Home 
screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and then tap Minimum Font Size. 
Your options are Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, and Giant. Use trial-
and-error to find out which size you prefer. Choose one and then read a 
message. If it’s not just right, choose a different size. Repeat until you’re 
happy.
 
✓ To specify whether the iPhone shows the To and Cc labels in mes-
sage lists: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars; and then turn the Show To/Cc Label setting on or off.
 
✓ To turn the Ask Before Deleting warning on or off: Tap the Settings 
icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and then turn 
the Ask Before Deleting setting on or off. If this setting is turned on, you 
need to tap the trash can icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap 
the red Delete button to confirm the deletion. When the setting is turned 
off, tapping the trash can icon deletes the message and you never see a 
red Delete button.
 
✓ To specify whether the phone will automatically load remote images: 
Tap Load Remote Images so that the on button is showing. If it’s off, you 
can still manually load remote images.
Altering account settings
The last group of settings we explore in this chapter deals with your e-mail 
accounts. You most likely will never need most of these settings, but we’d be 
remiss if we didn’t at least mention them briefly. So here they are, whether 
you need ’em or not:
 
✓ To stop using an e-mail account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home 
screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and then tap the account name. 
Tap the switch to turn off the account.
 
 This setting doesn’t delete the account; it only hides it from view and 
stops it from sending or checking e-mail until you turn it on again.
 
✓ To delete an e-mail account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, 
tap Mail, and then tap the account name. Scroll to the bottom and tap 
the red button that says Delete Account. You’re given a chance to recon-
sider. Tap Delete Account if you’re sure that you want this account 
blown away or tap Cancel if you change your mind and want to keep it.

165
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
The last settings are somewhat advanced and are reached the same way: 
Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen; tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; and 
then tap the name of the account you want to work with. The settings you 
see under Advanced and how they appear vary a little by account. This list 
describes some of the ones you see:
 
✓ To specify how long until deleted messages are removed permanently 
from your iPhone: Tap Advanced and then tap Remove. Your choices 
are Never, After One Day, After One Week, and After One Month. Tap the 
choice you prefer.
 
✓ To choose whether drafts, sent messages, and deleted messages are 
stored on your iPhone or on your mail server: Tap Advanced, and then 
choose the setting under Mailbox Behaviors stored On My iPhone or 
stored On the Server for Drafts, Sent Messages, and Trash. If you choose 
to store any or all of them on the server, you can’t see them unless you 
have an Internet connection (Wi-Fi, EDGE, or 3G). If you choose to store 
them on your iPhone, they’re always available, even if you don’t have 
Internet access.
 
 We strongly recommend that you not change these next two items 
unless you know exactly what you’re doing and why. If you’re having 
problems with sending or receiving mail, start by contacting your ISP 
(Internet service provider), e-mail provider, or corporate IT person or 
department. Then change these settings only if they tell you to.
 
✓ To reconfigure mail server settings: Tap Host Name, User Name, or 
Password in the Incoming Mail Server or Outgoing Mail Server section of 
the account settings screen and make your changes.
 
✓ To adjust Use SSL, Authentication, IMAP Path Settings, or Server Port: 
Tap Advanced, and then tap the appropriate item and make the neces-
sary changes.
And that, as they say in baseball, retires the side. You’re now fully qualified 
to set up e-mail accounts and send and receive e-mail on your iPhone.

Monitoring Maps, Contemplating 
Compass, Scrutinizing Stocks, 
and Watching Weather
In This Chapter
▶ Mapping your route with Maps
▶ Course-setting with Compass
▶ Getting quotes with Stocks
▶ Watching the weather with Weather
I
n this chapter we look at four of the iPhone’s Internet-enabled 
applications: Maps, Compass, Stocks, and Weather. We 
call them Internet-enabled because they display information 
collected over your Internet connection — whether Wi-Fi 
or wireless data network — in real (or in the case of 
Stocks, near-real) time.
Maps Are Where It’s At
In the first edition of this book we said that the 
Maps feature was one of the sleeper hits of our 
iPhone experience and an application we both use 
more than we expected because it’s so darn handy. 
Since then, Maps has become better and more capable. 
With Maps, you can quickly and easily discover exactly where 
you are, find nearby restaurants and businesses, get turn-by-turn 
driving instructions from any address to any other address, and 
see real-time traffic information for many locations.

168
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Finding your current location with Maps
 
 Let’s start with something supremely simple yet extremely useful — 
determining your current location. At the risk of sounding like self-help 
gurus, here’s how to find yourself: Tap the Maps icon and then tap the 
little compass icon in the lower-left corner.
If you have an iPhone 3G or 3GS, a pulsating blue marker indicates your loca-
tion on the map when its GPS is used to find your location (see Figure 12-1). 
Otherwise, a somewhat larger circle is used to show your approximate loca-
tion. Either way, when you move around, iPhone can update your location and 
adjust the map so the location indicator stays in the middle of the screen.
 
If you tap or drag the map, your iPhone continues to update your location; 
but it won’t recenter the marker, which means that the location indicator can 
move off the screen.
Finding a person, place, or thing
To find a person, place, or thing with Maps, tap the search field at the top of 
the screen to make the keyboard appear. Now type what you’re looking for. 
You can search for addresses, zip codes, intersections, towns, landmarks, 
and businesses by category and by name, or combinations, such as New 
York, NY 10022, pizza 60645, or Auditorium Shores Austin TX.
 
If the letters you type match names in your Contacts list, the matching con-
tacts appear in a list below the search field. Tap a name to see a map of that 
contact’s location. Maps is smart about it, too; it displays only the names of 
contacts that have a street address.
When you finish typing, tap Search. After a few seconds, a map appears. If 
you searched for a single location, it is marked with a single pushpin. If you 
searched for a category (pizza 60645, for example), you see multiple push-
pins, one for each matching location, as shown in Figure 12-2.
How does it do that?
Maps uses iPhone’s Location Services to deter-
mine your approximate location using available 
information from your wireless data network, 
local Wi-Fi networks (if Wi-Fi is turned on), 
and GPS (iPhone 3G and 3GS only). If you’re 
not using Location Services, turning it off will 
conserve your battery. (To turn it off, tap Settings, 
General, and Location Services.) Don’t worry if 
Location Services is turned off when you tap the 
compass icon — you’ll be prompted to turn it on. 
Finally, Location Services may not be available 
in all areas at all times.

pizza joints.
Views, zooms, and pans
 
 The preceding section talked about how to find just about anything with 
Maps. Now here’s a look at some ways you can use what you find. First, find 
out how to work with what you see on the screen. Four views are available at 
any time: Map, Satellite, Hybrid, and List. (Figure 12-2 shows the Map view.) 
Select one view by tapping the curling page button in the lower-right corner. 
The map then curls back and reveals several buttons, as shown in Figure 12-3.
In Map, Satellite, or Hybrid view, you can zoom to see either more or less of 
the map — or scroll (pan) to see what’s above, below, or to the left or right of 
what’s on the screen:
 
✓ To zoom out: Pinch the map or double-tap using two fingers. To zoom out 
even more, pinch or double-tap using two fingers again.
 
 This may be a new concept to you. To double-tap with two fingers, 
merely tap twice in rapid succession with two fingers rather than the 
usual one finger. That’s a total of four taps, input very efficiently as two 
taps per finger.

170
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 
Figure 12-3: The map curls back to reveal these buttons.
 
✓ To zoom in: Unpinch the map or double-tap (the usual way — with just 
one finger) the spot you want to zoom in on. Unpinch or double-tap with 
one finger again to zoom in even more.
 
 An unpinch is the opposite of a pinch. Start with your thumb and a finger 
together and then flick them apart.
 
 You can also unpinch with two fingers or two thumbs, one from each 
hand, but you’ll probably find that a single-handed pinch and unpinch is 
handier.
 
✓ To scroll: Flick or drag up, down, left, or right.
Maps and contacts
Maps and contacts go together like peanut butter and jelly. For example, if 
you want to see a map of a contact’s street address, tap the little bookmarks 
icon in the search field, tap the Contacts button at the bottom of the screen, 
and then tap the contact’s name. Or type the first few letters of the contact’s 
name in the search field and then tap the name in the list that automatically 
appears below the search field.
After you find a location by typing an address into Maps, you can add that 
location to one of your contacts. Or you can create a new contact with a 
location you’ve found. To do either, tap the location’s pushpin on the map, 

171
 Chapter 12: Maps, Compass, Stocks, and Weather
and then tap the little > in a blue circle to the right of the location’s name or 
description (shown next to Gullivers Pizzeria in Figure 12-2) to display its Info 
screen (see Figure 12-4).
 
 
Figure 12-4: The unscrolled Info screen for Gullivers Pizzeria (left), 
 
and the same screen when you scroll to the bottom (right).
Now tap either the Create New Contact button or the Add to Existing Contact 
button on the Info screen. You’ll probably have to scroll to the bottom of the 
Info screen to see these buttons (shown on the right in Figure 12-4).
 
You work with your contacts by tapping the Contacts icon on the second 
page of icons on your Home screen (swipe from right to left on your Home 
screen to see it) or tapping the Phone icon on your Home screen and then 
tapping the Contacts icon in the Phone screen’s Dock.
You can also get driving directions from most locations including a contact’s 
address to any other location including another contact’s address. You’ll see 
how to do that in the “Smart map tricks” section.
Timesaving map tools: Bookmarks, 
Recents, and Contacts
 
 Maps offers three tools that can save you from having to type the same loca-
tions over and over again. All three are in the Bookmarks screen, which 
appears when you tap the little blue bookmarks icon that appears on the 
right side of the search field when it’s empty (refer to Figure 12-3).

172
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
The fastest way to erase the search field and make the bookmarks icon 
appear is to tap the little x on the right, which causes the contents of the 
search field to disappear instantly.
At the bottom of the Bookmarks screen, you find three buttons: Bookmarks, 
Recents, and Contacts. The following sections give you the lowdown on these 
buttons.
Bookmarks
Bookmarks in the Maps application work like bookmarks in Safari. When you 
have a location you want to save as a bookmark so that you can reuse it later 
without typing a single character, tap the little > in a blue circle to the right of 
the location’s name or description to display the Info screen for that location. 
Tap the Add to Bookmarks button on the Info screen. (You may have to scroll 
down the Info screen to see the Add to Bookmarks button.)
You can also drop a pin anywhere on the map by tapping the curling page 
button in the lower-right corner, and then tapping the Drop Pin button. After 
you’ve dropped a pin, you can drag it anywhere on the map. When it’s where 
you want it, tap the pin if you don’t see the words Drag To Move Pin above 
it and Drag To Move Pin and a little > in a blue circle will appear. Tap the 
little > and the Info screen for the dropped pin appears. Now tap the Add 
to bookmarks button on the Info screen.
After you add a bookmark, you can recall it at any time. To do so, tap the 
bookmarks icon in any empty search field, tap the Bookmarks button at the 
bottom of the screen, and then tap the bookmark name to see it on a map.
 
The first things you should bookmark are your home and work addresses 
and your zip codes. These are things you use all the time with Maps, so you 
might as well bookmark them now to avoid typing them over and over.
 
Use zip code bookmarks to find nearby businesses. Choose the zip code 
bookmark, and then type what you’re looking for, such as 78729 pizza, 60645 
gas station, or 90201 Starbucks.
To manage your bookmarks, first tap the Edit button in the top-left corner of 
the Bookmarks screen. Then:
 
✓ To move a bookmark up or down in the Bookmarks list: Drag the little 
icon with three gray bars that appears to the right of the bookmark 
upward to move the bookmark higher in the list or downward to move 
the bookmark lower in the list.
 
✓ To delete a bookmark from the Bookmarks list: Tap the – sign to the 
left of the bookmark’s name.

173
 Chapter 12: Maps, Compass, Stocks, and Weather
When you’re finished using bookmarks, tap the Done button in the top-right 
corner of the Bookmarks screen to return to the map.
Recents
Maps automatically remembers every location you’ve searched for in its 
Recents list. To see this list, tap the bookmarks icon in any empty search 
field, and then tap the Recents button at the bottom of the screen. To see a 
map of a recent item, tap the item’s name.
To clear the Recents list, tap the Clear button in the top-left corner of the 
screen, and then tap the Clear All Recents button.
When you’re finished using the Recents list, tap the Done button in the top-
right corner of the screen to return to the map.
Contacts
To see a map of a contact’s location, tap the bookmarks icon in any empty 
search field, and then tap the Contacts button at the bottom of the screen. To 
see a map of a contact’s location, tap the contact’s name in the list.
To limit the Contacts list to specific groups (assuming you have some groups 
in your Contacts list), tap the Groups button in the top-left corner of the 
screen and then tap the name of the group. Now only contacts in this group 
are displayed in the list.
When you’re finished using the Contacts list, tap the Done button in the top-
right corner of the screen to return to the map.
Smart map tricks
The Maps application has more tricks up its sleeve. Here are a few nifty fea-
tures you may find useful.
Get route maps and driving directions
You can get route maps and driving directions to any location from any loca-
tion in a couple of ways:
 
✓ If a pushpin is already on the screen: Tap the pushpin and then tap 
the little > in a blue circle to the right of the name or description. This 
action displays the item’s Info screen. Now tap the Directions to Here or 
Directions from Here button to get directions to or from that location, 
respectively.
 
✓ When you’re looking at a map screen: Tap the Directions button at the 
bottom of the map screen. The Start and End fields appear at the top of 
the screen.

174
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 Type the starting and ending points or choose them from your book-
marks, recent maps, or contacts if you prefer. If you want to swap the 
starting and ending locations, tap the little swirly arrow button to the 
left of the Start and End fields.
 
 When the start and end locations are correct, tap the Route button in 
the bottom-right corner of the screen and the route map appears, as 
shown on the left side in Figure 12-5.
 
 If you need to change the start or end location, tap the Edit button in the 
top-left corner. If everything looks right, tap the Start button in the top-
right corner to receive turn-by-turn driving directions, as shown on the 
right side in Figure 12-5. To see the next step in the directions, tap 
the right-facing arrow in the top-right corner; to see the preceding 
step, tap the left-facing arrow in the top-right corner.
 
 
Figure 12-5: The route map from Bob’s first house in Skokie to 
 
Gullivers Pizza in Chicago (left) and the first step in the step-by-
 
step driving directions for that route (right).
If you prefer your driving directions displayed as a list with all the steps, as 
shown in Figure 12-6, tap the curling page button in the lower-right corner 
and then tap the List button.
When you’re finished with the step-by-step directions, tap the Search button 
at the bottom of the screen to return to the regular map screen and single 
search field.

175
 Chapter 12: Maps, Compass, Stocks, and Weather
 
As well as step-by-step directions work, we wish the iPhone offered the type 
of audible turn-by-turn directions feature found on some dedicated GPS 
devices. You know — where some friendly male or female voice barks out 
instructions (such as “turn right on Main Street”).
 
 
Figure 12-6: Step-by-step driving 
 
directions displayed as a list.
 
GPS maker TomTom (http://iphone.tomtom.com) announced a combina-
tion hardware/software product that apparently does just that. We’ve seen 
a brief demonstration and it looks pretty slick. Unfortunately, the product 
wasn’t available when this book went to press, so we can’t tell you how well 
(or even if) it works.
Get public transportation information and walking directions
After you’ve provided a starting and ending location and tapped the Route 
button, the next screen that appears has three icons near the top: a car, a 
bus, and a person walking. In the preceding example, we showed directions 
by car, which is the default.
For public transportation information, tap the bus icon instead. When you 
do, the departure and arrival times for the next bus or train appear, as shown 
on the left in Figure 12-7. Tap the little clock icon below the Start button (at 
the top of the screen) to see additional departure and arrival times, as shown 
on the right in Figure 12-7.

176
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
The step-by-step directions for public transportation routes explain where 
you need to walk to catch the bus or train, where you need to get off that bus 
or train, and where you have to walk from there to reach your destination, as 
shown in Figure 12-8.
 
 
Figure 12-7: The bus route and schedule (left) and additional departure 
 
times for that bus (right).
For step-by-step directions for walking, tap the person walking icon. Walking 
directions generally look a lot like driving directions except for your travel 
time. For example, driving time in Figure 12-5 is approximately 11 minutes 
with traffic; walking time (not shown) is estimated at 1 hour and 24 minutes.
Get traffic info in real time
You can find out the traffic conditions for whatever map you’re viewing by 
tapping the curling page button in the lower-right corner and then tapping the 
Show Traffic button. When you do this, major roadways are color-coded to 
inform you of the current traffic speed, as shown in Figure 12-9. Here’s the key:
 
✓ Green: 50 or more miles per hour
 
✓ Yellow: 25 to 50 miles per hour
 
✓ Red: Under 25 miles per hour
 
✓ Gray: No data available at this time
 
Traffic info doesn’t work in every location, but the only way to find out is to 
give it a try. If no color codes appear, assume that it doesn’t work for that 
particular location.

More about the Info screen
If a location has a little > in a blue circle to the right of its name or descrip-
tion (refer to Figure 12-2), you can tap it to see the location’s Info screen.
As we explained earlier in this chapter, you can get directions to or from that 
location, add the location to your bookmarks or contacts, or create a new 
contact from it. But there are still three more things you can do with a loca-
tion from its Info screen:
 
✓ Tap its phone number to call it.
 
✓ Tap its e-mail address to launch the Mail application and send an e-mail 
to it.
 
✓ Tap its URL to launch Safari and view its Web site.
Contemplating the Compass
The new Compass application, available only on the iPhone 3GS, works like 
a magnetic needle compass. Launch the Compass app by tapping its icon 
on your Home screen, and it shows you the direction you’re facing. In both 
screens shown in Figure 12-10, that direction is north.

178
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 
Figure 12-10: The Compass application says I’m facing north (left); the 
 
map with the cone also indicates that I’m currently facing north (right).
But wait — there’s more. If you tap the little compass icon in the lower-left 
corner, the Maps application launches. Now for the cool part: Tap the little 
compass icon in the lower-left corner of the Maps app two times and the blue 
marker grows a little white “cone” that indicates the direction you’re facing, 
as shown on the right in Figure 12-10.
Also note that when the map is in this compass mode, the little compass icon 
in its lower-left corner grows a little white cone as well, letting you know that 
you’re now using the compass mode.
 
If you rotate to face a different direction while Maps is in compass mode, the 
map rotates in real time. So the map always displays the direction you’re cur-
rently facing, even if you’ve moved around a bit, which is pretty darn cool.
Taking Stock with Stocks
Stocks is another Internet-enabled application on your iPhone. It’s kind of a 
one-trick pony, but if you need its trick — information about specific stocks — 
it’s a winner.
Every time you open the Stocks application by tapping its icon on the Home 
screen, it displays the latest price for your stocks, with two provisos:

179
 Chapter 12: Maps, Compass, Stocks, and Weather
 
✓ The quotes may be delayed by up to 20 minutes.
 
✓ The quotes are updated only if your iPhone can connect to the Internet 
via either Wi-Fi or a wireless data network.
So tap that Stocks icon and take a peek.
The first time you open Stocks, you see information for a group of default 
stocks, funds, and indexes. There are more of them than you can see on the 
screen at once, so flick upward to scroll down.
Adding and deleting stocks, funds, and indexes
Because the chance of you owning that exact group of stocks, funds, and 
indexes displayed on the screen is slim, this section shows you how to add 
your own stocks, funds, or indexes and delete any or all default ones if you 
want.
Here’s how to add a stock, a fund, or an index:
 
1. Tap the i button in the bottom-right corner of the initial Stocks screen.
 
 The i is for info.
 
2. Tap the + button in the top-left corner of the Stocks screen.
 
3. Type a stock symbol, or a company, index, or fund name.
 
4. Tap the Search button.
 
 Stocks finds the company or companies that match your search request.
 
5. Tap the one you want to add.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you’re through adding stocks, funds, and 
indexes.
 
7. Tap the Done button in the top-right corner.
And here’s how to delete a stock (the steps for deleting a fund or an index are 
the same):
 
1. Tap the i button in the bottom-right corner of the initial Stocks screen.
 
2. Tap the – button to the left of the stock’s name.
 
3. Tap the Delete button that appears to the right of the stock’s name.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all unwanted stocks have been deleted.
 
5. Tap the Done button.

180
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
That’s all there is to adding and deleting stocks.
 
 To change the order of the list, tap the i button and then drag the three hori-
zontal lines to the right of the stock, fund, or index up or down to its new 
place in the list.
Details, details, details
To see the details for an item, tap its name to select it and the lower por-
tion of the screen will offer additional information. Note the three small dots 
under the words “Quotes delayed by 20 minutes.” These dots tell you that 
there are three screens of information, all shown in Figure 12-11. To switch 
between these three screens, simply swipe to the left or the right on the 
lower part of the screen.
 
Yahoo.com button
Info button
Three little dots
 
Figure 12-11: The Stocks screen(s).
To look up additional information about a stock at Yahoo.com, first tap the 
stock’s name to select it, and then tap the Y! button in the lower-left corner of 
the screen. Safari launches and displays the Yahoo.com finance page for that 
stock.
Charting a course
Referring to Figure 12-11, note the chart at the bottom of the middle image. At 
the top of the chart, you see a bunch of numbers and letters, namely 1d, 1w, 

181
 Chapter 12: Maps, Compass, Stocks, and Weather
1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, and 2y. They stand for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 
months (selected in Figure 12-11), 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Tap one 
of them and the chart updates to reflect that period of time.
That’s sweet but here’s an even sweeter feature introduced in iPhone OS 
3.0: If you rotate your iPhone 90 degrees, the chart appears in full-screen, as 
shown in Figure 12-12. Here are three cool things you can do with full-screen 
charts:
 
✓ Touch any point in time to see the value for that day.
 
✓ Use two fingers to touch any two points in time to see the difference in 
values between those two days, as shown in Figure 12-12.
 
✓ Swipe left or right to see the chart for another stock, fund, or index.
 
 
Figure 12-12: Using two fingers to see the difference in values ($27.08 
 
or 28.70%) between two days (Feb. 18 and Apr. 16, 2009).
By default, Stocks displays the change in a stock’s price in dollars. You can 
instead see the change expressed as a percentage or as the stock’s market 
capitalization. The easy way is to tap the number next to any stock (green 
numbers are positive; red numbers are negative). That toggles the display 
for all stocks — dollar change, percent change, market cap. So if your stocks, 
funds, and indexes are currently displayed as dollars, tapping any one of 
them switches them all to percent — and tapping again switches them to 
market cap.

182
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
The second way takes more steps: Tap the i button in the bottom-right 
corner of the initial Stocks screen. Then tap the %, Price, or Mkt Cap button 
at the bottom of the screen. The values are then displayed in the manner you 
chose. Tap the Done button in the top-right corner when you’re finished.
Weather Watching
Weather is a simple application that provides you with the current weather 
forecast for the city or cities of your choice. By default, you see a six-day 
forecast for the chosen city, as shown in Figure 12-13.
If the background for the forecast is blue, as it is in Figure 12-13, it’s daytime 
(between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.) in that city; if it’s a deep purple, it’s night-
time (between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.).
To add a city, first tap the i button in the bottom-right corner. Tap the + 
button in the upper-left corner and then type a city and state or zip code. Tap 
the Search button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Tap the name of 
the found city. Add as many cities as you want this way.
To delete a city, tap the i button in the bottom-right corner. Tap the red – 
button to the left of its name, and then tap the Delete button that appears to 
the right of its name.
You can also choose between Fahrenheit and Celsius by first tapping the i 
button in the bottom-right corner and then tapping either the °F or °C button 
near the bottom of the screen. When you’re finished, tap the Done button in 
the top-right corner of the screen.
If you’ve added more than one city to Weather, you can switch between them 
by flicking your finger across the screen to the left or the right.
 
See the three little dots — one white and two gray — at the bottom of the 
screen in Figure 12-13? They denote the number of cities you have stored 
(which is three in this case).
Last, but not least, to see detailed weather information about a city at Yahoo.
com, tap the Y! button in the lower-left corner of the screen. Safari launches 
and then displays the Yahoo.com weather page for the current city, as shown 
in Figure 12-14.

The Undiscovered 
iPhone

T
his part is where we show you what’s under 
the hood and how to conﬁ gure your iPhone to 
your liking. Then we look at the things to do if 
your iPhone ever becomes recalcitrant.
In Chapter 13 we explore every single iPhone set-
ting that’s not discussed in depth elsewhere in the 
book. iPhone offers dozens of different prefer-
ences and settings to make your iPhone your very 
own; by the time you ﬁ nish with Chapter 13, you’ll 
know how to customize every part of your iPhone 
that can be customized.
We love going on a shopping spree as much as the 
next guy. Chapter 14 is all about learning to shop 
in the brand new iPhone App Store, an emporium 
replete with a gaggle of neat little programs and 
applications. Best of all, unlike most of the stores 
you shop in, a good number of the items can be 
had for free.
iPhones are well-behaved little beasts for the most 
part, except when they’re not. Like the little girl 
with the little curl, when they’re good they’re very, 
very good, but when they’re bad, they’re horrid. 
So Chapter 15 is your comprehensive guide to 
troubleshooting for the iPhone. It details what to 
do when almost anything goes wrong, offering 
step-by-step instructions for speciﬁ c situations as 
well as a plethora of tips and techniques you can 
try if something else goes awry. You may never 
need Chapter 15 (and we hope you won’t), but 
you’ll be very glad we put it here if your iPhone 
ever goes wonky on you.

A
re you a control freak? The type of person who must have it your way? 
Boy, have you landed in the right chapter.
Throughout this book, you’ve had occasion to drop in on 
Settings, which is kind of the makeover factory for the 
iPhone. For example, we show you how to open Settings 
(by tapping its Home screen icon) to set ringtones, 
change the phone’s background or wallpaper, and 
specify Google or Yahoo! as the search engine of 
choice. We also show you how to alter security set-
tings in Safari, tailor e-mail to your liking (among 
other modifications), and get a handle on how to 
fetch or push new data.
 
The Settings area on the iPhone is roughly analogous 
to the Control Panel in Windows and System 
Preferences on a Mac.
Because we cover some settings elsewhere, we don’t dwell 
on every setting here. But there’s plenty still to discover to help 
you make the iPhone your own.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Sky-High Settings
When you first open Settings, you see the scrollable list shown in Figure 13-1. 
In all but airplane mode (at the top of the list), a greater-than symbol (>) 
appears to the right of each listing. This symbol tells you that the listing has 
a bunch of options. Throughout this chapter, you tap the > symbol to check 
out those options.
 
 
Figure 13-1: Presenting your list of 
 
settings.
If you scroll down to the bottom of the Settings list, you may see settings that 
pertain to some of the specific third-party apps you’ve added to the iPhone 
(see Chapter 14).
Airplane mode
Using a cell phone on an airplane is a no-no. But there’s nothing verboten 
about using an iPod on a plane to listen to music, watch videos, and peek at 
pictures — at least, after the craft has reached cruising altitude.

189
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
So how do you take advantage of the iPhone’s built-in iPod (among other 
capabilities) while temporarily turning off its phone, e-mail, and Internet func-
tions? The answer is, by turning on airplane mode.
To do so, merely tap Airplane Mode on the Settings screen to display On 
(rather than Off).
That act disables each of the iPhone’s wireless radios: Wi-Fi, Edge, 3G (if 
applicable), and Bluetooth. While your iPhone is in airplane mode, you can’t 
make or receive calls, surf the Web, watch YouTube, or do anything else that 
requires an Internet connection. The good news is that airplane mode keeps 
your battery running longer — particularly useful if the flight you’re on is 
taking you halfway around the world.
 
 The appearance of a tiny airplane icon on the status bar in the top-left corner 
reminds you that airplane mode is turned on. Just remember to turn it off 
when you’re back on the ground.
 
If you plug the iPhone into an iPod accessory that isn’t necessarily compat-
ible because of possible interference from the iPhone’s wireless radios, it 
offers to turn on airplane mode for you, as the message displayed in Figure 
13-2 indicates.
Wi-Fi
As we mention in Chapter 10, Wi-Fi is typically the fastest wireless network 
you can use to surf the Web, send e-mail, and perform other Internet tricks 
on the iPhone. You use the Wi-Fi setting to determine which Wi-Fi networks 
are available to you and which one to exploit based on its signal.
Tap Wi-Fi and all Wi-Fi networks in range are displayed, as shown in Figure 
13-3. (Alternatively, you can reach this screen by tapping the General setting, 
tapping Network, and then tapping Wi-Fi.)
A signal-strength indicator can help you choose the network to connect to if 
more than one is listed; tap the appropriate Wi-Fi network when you reach a 
decision. If a network is password-protected, you see a lock icon.
You can also turn the Ask to Join Networks setting on or off. Networks that 
the iPhone is already familiar with are joined automatically, regardless of 
which one you choose. If the Ask feature is on, you’re asked before joining a 
new network. If it’s off, you have to select a network manually.

options.
 
If you used a particular network automatically in the past but you no longer 
want your iPhone to join it, tap the > symbol next to the network in question 
(within Wi-Fi settings), and then tap Forget This Network. The iPhone devel-
ops a quick case of selective amnesia.
 
In some instances, you have to supply other technical information about a 
network you hope to glom on to. You encounter a bunch of nasty-sounding 
terms: DHCP, boot IP, static, IP address, subnet mask, router, DNS, search 
domains, client ID, HTTP proxy, and Renew Lease. (At least this last one has 
nothing to do with real estate or the vehicle you’re driving.) Chances are that 
none of this info is on the tip of your tongue — but that’s okay. For one thing, 
it’s a good bet that you’ll never need to know this stuff. What’s more, even 
if you do have to fill in or adjust these settings, a network administrator or 
techie friend can probably help you out.
Sometimes, you may want to connect to a network that’s closed and not 
shown on the Wi-Fi list. If that’s the case, tap Other and use the keyboard to 
enter the network name. Then tap to choose the type of security setting the 
network is using (if any). Your choices are WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA Enterprise, 
and WPA2 Enterprise. Again, it’s not exactly the friendliest terminology, but 
we figure that someone nearby can provide assistance.
 
If no Wi-Fi network is available, you have to rely on 3G or EDGE. If that’s not 
available either, you can’t rocket into cyberspace until you regain access to a 
network.

 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
Settings for Your Senses
The next bunch of settings control what the iPhone looks like and sounds like.
Sounds
Consider the Sounds settings area, the iPhone’s soundstage. There, you can 
turn audio alerts on or off for a variety of functions: new voicemail messages, 
new text messages, new mail, sent mail, and calendar alerts. You also set 
ringtones here (as described in Chapter 4).
Other options: You can decide whether you want to hear lock sounds and 
keyboard clicks. You can determine whether the iPhone should vibrate when 
you receive a call. And, you can drag the volume slider to determine the loud-
ness of your ringer and alerts.
Here’s an alternative: You can use the physical Volume buttons on the side 
of the iPhone for this purpose, as long as you’re not already on a call or using 
the iPod to listen to music or watch video.
Brightening up your day
Who doesn’t want a bright, vibrant screen? Alas, the brightest screens exact a 
trade-off: Before you drag the brightness slider shown in Figure 13-4 to the max, 
remember that brighter screens sap the life from your battery more quickly.
 
 
Figure 13-4: Sliding this control adjusts 
 
screen brightness.

192
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
That’s why we recommend tapping the Auto-Brightness control so that it’s 
on. It adjusts the screen according to the lighting conditions around the 
iPhone while being considerate of your battery.
Wallpaper
Choosing wallpaper is a neat way to dress up the iPhone according to your 
taste. You can sample the pretty patterns and designs that the iPhone has 
already chosen for you by tapping the thumbnails shown in Figure 13-5. Of 
course, although the Mona Lisa is one of your choices, DaVinci may not quite 
compete with the masterpieces in your own photo albums (more about those 
in Chapter 9). After making a selection, tap the image and then tap Set.
 
 
Figure 13-5: Choosing a masterpiece background.
In General
Certain miscellaneous settings are difficult to pigeonhole. Apple wisely 
lumped these under the General settings moniker. Here’s a closer look.
About About
You aren’t seeing double. This section is all about the setting known as 
About. And About is full of trivial (and not-so-trivial) information about the 
device. What you find here is straightforward:
 
✓ Name of your network
 
✓ Number of songs stored on the device
 
✓ Number of videos

193
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
 
✓ Number of photos
 
✓ Number of applications
 
✓ Storage capacity used and available: Because of the way the device 
is formatted, you always have a little less storage than the advertised 
amount of flash memory.
 
✓ Software version: We were up to version 3.0 as this book was being 
published. But as the software is tweaked and updated, your device goes 
a little beyond. So you see, in parentheses next to the version number, 
a number that looks like 7A341. That (or another string of numbers and 
letters) is the build number of the software version you have. It changes 
whenever the iPhone’s software is updated.
 
✓ Carrier: Yep, that’s AT&T in the United States.
 
✓ Serial and model numbers
 
✓ Wi-Fi address
 
✓ Bluetooth address: More on Bluetooth shortly.
 
✓ IMEI and ICCID: Say what? These abbreviations stand for the Inter-
national Mobile Equipment Identity and Integrated Circuit Card Identifier 
(or Smart Card) numbers. Hey, we warned you some of this was trivial.
 
✓ Modern firmware: The version of the cellular transmitter.
 
✓ Legal and Regulatory: You had to know that the lawyers would get 
their two cents in somehow. All the fine print is here. And fine print it 
is. Although you can flick to scroll these lengthy legal notices, you can’t 
pinch the screen to enlarge the text. (Not that we can imagine more than 
a handful of you will bother to read this legal mumbo jumbo.)
Using Usage
Think of the Usage setting as one of the places to go on the iPhone for statis-
tics on how you employ the device. You find other information in the About 
setting (under General on the Settings screen), described a little earlier in 
this chapter.
You can scroll up or down the Usage list to discover this information:
 
✓ The amount of time since you last fully charged your iPhone: Indicated 
in days and hours, for the time when the iPhone has been unlocked and 
used and also when it has been in Standby mode.
 
✓ Call time: Shown for the current period and for the lifetime of the product.
 
✓ Cellular Network Data: The amount of network data you sent and 
received over EDGE or 3G. You can reset these statistics by tapping the 
Reset Statistics button at the bottom of the screen.

194
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Network
Four major controls appear under Network Settings, one of which, Wi-Fi, we 
addressed earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 10. The others are Enable 
3G, Data Roaming, and VPN. In this section, we tackle them one by one.
Enable 3G
As you’re aware by now, the major benefit of the AT&T 3G network is that it’s 
a lot faster than EDGE (though still not as zippy as Wi-Fi). Regardless, you’re 
not always going to be carrying the iPhone in a 3G area — and even when 
you are in coverage, you don’t always need to take advantage of faster data 
speeds. Under these circumstances, tap the Enable 3G button so that Off is 
showing. Why turn off 3G? The faster network also drains your battery much 
faster. Tap Enable 3G to turn the network back on when you need to.
Of course, the Enable 3G option only turns up on the iPhone 3G or 3GS.
Data roaming
You may unwittingly rack up lofty roaming fees when using Safari, exchanging 
e-mails, and engaging in other data-heavy activities while traveling abroad. 
Turn off data roaming to avoid those excess charges.
FYI on VPN
 
A virtual private network, or VPN, is a way for you to securely access your 
company’s network behind the firewall — using an encrypted Internet con-
nection that acts as a secure “tunnel” for data. The 3.0 version of the iPhone 
software supports the protocols L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol), PPTP 
(Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol), and Cisco IPSec VPN, which apparently 
provides the kind of security that satisfies network administrators.
You can configure a VPN on the iPhone by tapping VPN under Network, tap-
ping Add VPN Configuration, and then tapping one of the aforementioned 
protocols. Then, using configuration settings provided by your company, fill 
in the appropriate server information, account, password, encryption level 
(if appropriate), and other information. Better yet, lend your iPhone to the 
techies at the place you work and let them fill in the blanks on your behalf.
After you configure your iPhone for VPN usage, you can turn that capability 
on or off by tapping (yep) the VPN On or Off switch inside Settings.

195
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
Bluetooth
Of all the peculiar terms you may encounter in techdom, Bluetooth is one of 
our favorites. The name is derived from a tenth century Danish king named 
Harald Blåtand, who, the story goes, helped unite warring factions. And, 
we’re told, Blåtand translates to Bluetooth in English. (Bluetooth is all about 
collaboration between different types of devices — get it?)
Blåtand was obviously ahead of his time. Although we can’t imagine that 
he ever dialed a cell phone, he now has an entire short-range wireless tech-
nology named in his honor. On the iPhone, you can use Bluetooth to com-
municate wirelessly with a compatible Bluetooth headset or hands-free car 
kit. These optional headsets and kits are made by Apple and many others. 
They’ve become more of a big deal as a number of states and municipalities 
around the United States make it illegal to hold a phone to your mouth and 
ear to gab while you’re driving.
To ensure that the iPhone works with one of these devices, it has to be wire-
lessly paired, or coupled, with the chosen device. With the optional iPhone 
Bluetooth headset that Apple sells, you can automatically pair the devices by 
placing the iPhone and headset in a dual dock (supplied with the headset), 
which you connect to your computer.
If you’re using a third-party accessory, follow the instructions that came with 
that headset or car kit so that it becomes discoverable, or ready to be paired 
with your iPhone. Then turn on Bluetooth (under General on the Settings 
screen) so that the iPhone can find such nearby devices and the device can 
find the iPhone. Bluetooth works up to a range of about 30 feet.
 
 You know Bluetooth is turned on when you see the Bluetooth icon on the 
status bar. If the symbol is blue or white, the iPhone is communicating wire-
lessly with a connected device. (The color differences provide contrast to 
whatever is behind the icon.) If it’s gray, Bluetooth is turned on in the iPhone 
but a paired device isn’t nearby or isn’t turned on.
To unpair a device, select it from the device list, shown in Figure 13-6 and tap 
Unpair.
Apple added support for stereo Bluetooth headphones, car kits, and other 
accessories along with the OS 3.0 software upgrade. So you can now stream 
stereo audio from the iPhone to those devices.

196
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
 
Figure 13-6: Falling out of love — 
 
unpairing devices.
Eventually, you’ll be able to exploit Bluetooth (or a USB cable) to share an 
Internet connection with your laptop. But tethering, as this procedure is 
known, requires support from your wireless carrier. AT&T plans to offer 
tethering to U.S. customers, but hadn’t announced when (or pricing) at the 
time we were writing this book. The feature already works in some foreign 
countries.
 
If you poke around the Internet, you might find some unsanctioned tethering 
work-arounds.
To turn on tethering (when available), tap Settings, General, Network, 
Internet Tethering and make sure the switch is turned to on.
The iPhone can tap into Bluetooth in other ways. One is through peer-to-
peer connectivity, in which you can engage in multiplayer games with other 
nearby iPhone users. You can also do such things as exchange business 
cards, share pictures, and send short notes. Even as we write this book, 
third-party developers have to be licking their chops over what they can do 
with Bluetooth on the iPhone. And, you don’t even have to pair the devices, 
as you do with a headset or car kit.
 
You still can’t use Bluetooth to exchange files or sync between an iPhone and 
a computer. Nor can you use it to print stuff from the iPhone on a Bluetooth 
printer. That’s because the iPhone doesn’t support any of the Bluetooth pro-
files (or specifications) required to allow such wireless stunts to take place.

197
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
 
Stereo Bluetooth still doesn’t work on the original iPhone.
Location services
Location, location, location. By using Maps, through (several) apps, and 
by geotagging photos taken with its camera, the iPhone makes good use of 
knowing where you are. The iPhone 3G and 3GS exploit built-in GPS, but even 
the older-generation iPhone can find your general whereabouts (by triangulat-
ing signals from Wi-Fi base stations and cellular towers).
If that statement creeps you out a little, don’t fret. To protect your right to 
privacy, individual apps pop up quick messages (similar to the one shown in 
Figure 13-7) asking whether you want them to use your current location. But 
you can also turn off Location Services right there in Settings. Not only is your 
privacy shielded but you also keep your iPhone battery juiced a little longer.
 
 
Figure 13-7: The Where app wants to know 
 
where you are.
Auto-lock
You can set the amount of time that elapses before the phone automatically 
locks or turns off the display. Your choices are Five Minutes Before, Four 
Minutes Before, and so on, all the way down to One Minute. Or, you can set it 
so that the iPhone never locks automatically.
 
If you work for a company that insists on a passcode (see the next section), 
the Never Auto-Lock option isn’t on the list your iPhone shows you.
Don’t worry if the iPhone is locked. You can still receive calls and text mes-
sages and adjust the volume.
Passcode
You can choose a passcode to prevent people from unlocking the iPhone. 
Tap Passcode Lock. Then use the virtual keypad to enter a 4-digit code. 
During this setup, you have to enter the code a second time before it’s 
accepted.

198
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
You can also determine whether a passcode is required immediately, After 
1 Minute, After 5 Minutes, After 15 Minutes, or After 1 Hour. Shorter times 
are more secure, of course. On the topic of security, the iPhone can be set to 
automatically erase your data if you’ve made ten failed passcode attempts.
You can also change the passcode or turn it off later (unless your employer 
dictates otherwise), but you need to know the present passcode to apply any 
changes. If you forget the passcode, you have to restore the iPhone software, 
as described in Chapter 15.
Under Passcode Lock settings on the 3GS, you have the option to turn voice 
dialing on or off.
Restrictions
Parents and bosses may love the Restrictions tools, but kids and employees 
usually think otherwise. You can clamp down, um, provide proper parental 
guidance to your children, by preventing them at least some of the time from 
using the Safari browser, YouTube, location services, the camera, or iTunes. 
Or, you might not let them install new apps or make purchases inside the 
apps you do allow. When restrictions are in place, icons for off-limit functions 
can no longer be seen.
Indeed, Apple gave parents more controls to work with when it unleashed 
the OS 3.0 software. For instance, you can allow Junior to watch a movie on 
the iPhone but prevent him from watching a flick that carries an R or NC-17 
rating. You can also restrict access to certain TV shows and apps, based on 
age-appropriate ratings. Stop feeling guilty: You have your users’ best inter-
ests at heart.
Home button
You can assign shortcuts to the Home button. You can arrange it so that 
double-clicking Home transports you to the new Spotlight Search feature, 
described in Chapter 2. Double-clicking Home can launch the Phone Favorites 
screen (see Chapter 4). Another double-clicking option summons the Camera, 
and one more opens the iPod.
The default setting for double-clicking Home shares something in common 
with Dorothy of Kansas: If you don’t change this setting, double-clicking the 
Home button brings you back to the Home screen. Why? Because there’s no 
place like Home. (Groan.)

199
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
You can do two more things under the Home settings:
 
✓ Switch the iPod Controls setting to On if you want iPod controls to 
appear when you double-tap the Home button while music is playing.
 
✓ Tap Search Results to determine which applications show up when you 
do a Spotlight search.
Date and time
In our neck of the woods, the time is reported as 11:32 PM (or whatever time 
it happens to be). But in some circles, it’s reported as 23:32. If you prefer the 
latter format on the iPhone’s status bar, tap the 24-Hour Time setting (under 
Date & Time) so that it’s on.
This setting is just one that you can adjust under Date & Time. You can also 
have the iPhone set the time automatically, using the time reported by the 
cellular network (and adjusted for the time zone you’re in).
If automatic time-setting is turned off, you’re asked to choose the time zone 
and then set the date and time manually. Here’s how:
 
1. Tap Set Automatically so that it’s off.
 
 You see fields for setting the time zone and the date and time.
 
2. Tap the Time Zone field.
 
 The current time zone and virtual keyboard are shown.
 
3. Tap out the letters of the city or country whose time zone you want to 
enter until the one you have in mind appears. Then tap the name of 
that city or country.
 
 The Time Zone field is automatically filled in for that city.
 
4. Tap the Set Date & Time field so that the time is shown. Then roll the 
bicycle-lock-like controls until the proper time is displayed.
 
5. Tap the date shown so that the bicycle-lock-like controls pop up for 
the date. Then roll the wheels for the month, day, and year until the 
correct date appears.
 
6. Tap the Date & Time button to return to the main Date & Time settings 
screen.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Keyboard
Under Keyboard settings, you can turn autocapitalization on or off and turn 
Enable Caps Lock on or off.
Autocapitalization, which the iPhone turns on by default, means that the first 
letter of the first word you type after ending the preceding sentence with a 
period, a question mark, or an exclamation point is capitalized.
If Cap Locks is enabled, all letters are uppercased LIKE THIS if you double-tap 
the Shift key. (The Shift key is the one with the arrow pointing north.)
You can also turn on a keyboard setting that inserts a period followed by a 
space when you double-tap the spacebar. Additionally, you can choose to 
use an international keyboard (as discussed in Chapter 2), which you choose 
from the International setting — the next setting after Keyboard in the 
General settings area.
International
The iPhone is an international sensation. It’s sold and used around the world 
by people of all nationalities. In the International section, you can set the 
language you type on (by using a custom virtual keyboard), the language in 
which the iPhone displays text, and the language in which it speaks through 
Voice Controls.
Accessibility
The Accessibility tools (these are available on the 3GS only) are targeted at 
people with certain disabilities:
 
✓ VoiceOver: This screen reader describes aloud what’s on the screen. It 
can read e-mail messages, Web pages, and more.
 
✓ Zoom: A screen magnifier for those who are visually challenged. To 
zoom, double-tap the screen with three fingers, and drag three fingers to 
move around the screen.
 
✓ White on Black: The colors on the iPhone are reversed to provide a 
higher contrast for people with poor eyesight
 
✓ Mono Audio: If you suffer hearing loss in one ear, the iPhone can com-
bine the right and left audio channels so that both can be heard in both 
earbuds.
 
✓ Speak Auto-Text: When this setting is on, the iPhone automatically 
speaks autocorrections and capitalizations.

201
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
Reset
As little kids playing sports, we ended an argument by agreeing to a “do-
over.” Well, the Reset settings on the iPhone are one big do-over. Now that 
we’re (presumably) grown up, we’re wise enough to think long and hard 
about the consequences before implementing do-over settings. Regardless, 
you may encounter good reasons for starting over; some of these are 
addressed in Chapter 15.
Here are your reset options:
 
✓ Reset All Settings: Resets all settings, but no data or media is deleted.
 
✓ Erase All Content and Settings: Resets all settings and wipes out all 
your data.
 
✓ Reset Network Settings: Deletes the current network settings and 
restores them to their factory defaults.
 
✓ Reset Keyboard Dictionary: Removes added words from the dictionary. 
As we point out early on, the iPhone keyboard is intelligent. And, one 
reason it’s so smart is that it learns from you. So when you reject words 
that the iPhone keyboard suggests, it figures that the words you specifi-
cally banged out ought to be added to the keyboard dictionary.
 
✓ Reset Home Screen Layout: Reverts all icons to the way they were at 
the factory.
 
✓ Reset Location Warnings: Restores factory defaults.
Phoning In More Settings
We cover most of the remaining settings in other chapters devoted to e-mail, 
calendars, the iPod (photos and music), Safari, and e-mail. Still, there are few 
more we didn’t get to — ’til now.
Sorting and displaying contacts
Do you think of us as Ed and Bob or Baig and LeVitus? The answer to that 
question will probably determine whether you choose to sort your Contacts 
list alphabetically by last name or first.
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; scroll down to the Contacts section; and peek 
at Sort Order. Then tap Last, First or First, Last.
You can also determine whether you want to display a first name or last 
name first. Tap Display Order and then choose First, Last or Last, First.

Nothing phone-y about these settings
Over in Chapter 4, we tip our hand and indicate that we save a few more 
phone tricks — those found in Phone settings — for this chapter.
Tap Phone now to review some of the choices we don’t get to in that chapter. 
Be aware that you have to scroll down the screen to find Phone settings.
Call forwarding
If you expect to spend time in an area with poor or no cell phone coverage, 
you may want to temporarily forward calls to a landline or other portable 
handset. Here are the simple steps:
 
1. On the Settings screen, tap Phone and then tap Call Forwarding.
 
2. Tap to turn on Call Forwarding.
 
3. Use the virtual keypad to enter the number where you want incoming 
calls to ring.
 
4. Tap the Call Forwarding button to return to the main Call Forwarding 
screen.
To change the forwarding number, tap the circle with the X in the Phone 
Number field to get rid of the old number, and then enter a new one.
Remember to turn off Call Forwarding to receive calls directly on your iPhone 
again.
 
You must have cellular coverage while setting the Call Forwarding feature.
Call waiting
Tap the Call Waiting button to turn the feature on or off. If Call Waiting is off 
and you’re speaking on the phone, the call is automatically dispatched to 
voicemail.
Caller ID
Don’t want your name or number displayed on the phone you’re calling? 
Make sure to tap Show My Caller ID so that it’s off. If privacy isn’t a concern, 
you can leave this setting on.
TTY
Folks who are hearing impaired sometimes rely on a teletype, or TTY, 
machine, to hold conversations. You can use the iPhone with standard TTY 
devices by plugging a cable from the TTY device into an optional $19 iPhone 
TTY adapter, and then plugging the adapter into the iPhone. Make sure the 
TTY setting on the phone is turned on.

203
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
SIM locking
The tiny SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card inside your iPhone holds 
your phone number and other important data. Tap to turn on SIM PIN and 
enter a password with the keypad. That way, if someone gets hold of your 
SIM, he can’t use it in another phone without the password.
 
If you assign a PIN to your SIM, you have to enter it to turn the iPhone off and 
on again.
AT&T Services
There’s a major difference between the iPhone and all the other Apple prod-
ucts you might buy. That’s because you’re entering into a relationship with 
not only Apple but also the phone company. Tap AT&T Services and then tap 
any of the following options for a shortcut phone call:
 
✓ Check Bill Balance: The phone dials *225# and, if all goes according to 
plan, you receive a text message with the due date and sum owed. This 
type of text message isn’t counted against your messaging allotment.
 
✓ Call Directory Assistance: The phone dials 411.
 
✓ Pay My Bill: The iPhone dials *729 and you’re connected to an auto-
mated voice system. You can pay your bill with a checking account, 
debit card, or credit card by following the voice prompts.
 
 You’re billed for phone service from AT&T, not from Apple. Of course, 
charges for any music or other content purchased in iTunes from your 
computer are paid to Apple through whichever credit card you have on 
file, as with any iPod.
 
✓ View My Minutes: This time, *646# is called. You again receive a text 
reply that doesn’t count against your messaging allotment.
 
✓ Voice Connect: The iPhone dials *08 to connect you to automated news, 
weather, sports, quotes, and more. Just bark out the kind of information 
you’re looking for, such as finance, and follow voice prompts for stock 
quotes and business news, for example. Or, say “Sports” and follow the 
voice prompts to see the latest scores of your favorite team.
 
 Not all AT&T Services make a phone call. If you tap the AT&T MyAccount

You’re passionate about fitness. You’re equally passionate about music. In 
the summer of 2006, Apple teamed with the folks at Nike on a $29 wireless 
sports kit that lets runners place a sensor inside a Nike sneaker that can wire-
lessly communicate with a receiver connected to an iPod Nano. As runners 
dash off, they can track time, distance, and calories burned on the Nano, 

204
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
receive vocal feedback, and upload results to a Nike Web site. Runners can 
even play a select “power song” on the iPod for that last push when they’re 
feeling exhausted.
Apple added the Nike + app to the iPhone 3GS (but not to earlier models). 
When you turn on the app inside Settings, your iPhone can record every step 
you make. You don’t have to connect a separate receiver, as you do on the 
Nano. By using Nike + on your iPhone, you can choose one of the workout 
routines shown in Figure 13-8.

Find My iPhone
We hope you never have to use the Find My iPhone feature — though we 
have to say that it’s pretty darn cool. If you inadvertently leave your iPhone 
in a taxi or restaurant, Find My iPhone may just help you retrieve it. The 
feature requires a MobileMe subscription.
To turn on Find My iPhone, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then tap the 
me.com e-mail account you added to the iPhone. You get a me.com e-mail 
account when you join MobileMe. If necessary, refer to Chapter 11 to see how 
to add an e-mail account to the iPhone.

205
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
Now suppose that you lost your phone — and we can only assume that 
you’re beside yourself. Log in to your MobileMe me.com account from any 
browser on your computer. Click Find My iPhone.
Assuming that your phone is turned on and in the coverage area, its general 
whereabouts should turn up on a map, as shown in Figure 13-9. In our tests, 
Find My iPhone found our iPhones quickly.
 
 
Figure 13-9: Locating a lost iPhone.
The truth is that even seeing your iPhone on a map may not help you much, 
especially if the phone is lost somewhere in midtown Manhattan. Take heart. 
At the MobileMe site, click Display a Message and then bang out a plea to the 
Good Samaritan that you hope picked up your phone. The message appears 
on the lost iPhone’s screen. Don’t forget to include in the message a way for 
the person to reach you, such as the message displayed on the iPhone in 
Figure 13-10.

Figure 13-10: An appeal to return the phone.
To get someone’s attention, you can also sound an alarm that plays for two 
minutes, even if the phone was in silent mode. Hey, that alarm may come in 
handy if the phone turns up under a couch in your house.
After all this labor, if the phone is seemingly gone for good, click Remote 
Wipe at the MobileMe site to delete your personal data from afar and return 
the iPhone to its factory settings. And, if you ever get your phone back after-
ward, you can always restore the information from an iTunes backup on your 
Windows PC or Mac.
We trust that you control freaks are satisfied with all the stuff you can 
manage inside Settings. Still, the iPhone may not always behave as you 
want. For the times when things get out of control, we highly recommend 
Chapter 15.

O
ne of the best things about the iPhone these days is 
that you can download and install applications cre-
ated by third parties, which is to say not created by 
Apple (the first party) or you (the second party). At 
the time of this writing, more than 50,000 applica-
tions are available and well over 1,000,000,000 (yes, 
a billion) apps have been downloaded. Some apps 
are free, other apps cost money; some apps are 
useful, other apps are lame; some apps are per-
fectly well-behaved, other apps quit unexpectedly 
(or worse). The point is that a lot of apps are out 
there and that some are better than others.
In this chapter, we take a broad look at iPhone apps. 
Don’t worry: We have plenty to say about specific apps in 
Chapters 16 and 17.
You can obtain and install applications for your iPhone in two ways:
 
✓ On your computer
 
✓ On your iPhone

208
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
To use the App Store on your iPhone, it must be connected to the Internet. 
And, if you obtain an app on your computer, it isn’t available on your iPhone 
until you sync it with your computer.
But before you can use the App Store on your iPhone or your computer, you 
first need an iTunes Store account. If you don’t already have one, we suggest 
that you launch iTunes on your computer and click Sign In near the upper-
right corner of the iTunes window and then click Create New Account and 
follow the on-screen instructions. Or, if you prefer to create your account on 
your iPhone rather than on your computer, follow the instructions near the 
end of Chapter 7.
 
Let’s put it this way: If you don’t have an iTunes Store account, you can’t 
download a single cool app for your iPhone. ’Nuff said.
Using Your Computer to Find Applications
Okay, start by finding cool iPhone applications using iTunes on your com-
puter. Follow these steps:
 
1. Launch iTunes.
 
2. Click the iTunes Store in the source list on the left.
 
 
3. Click the App Store link.
 
 The iTunes App Store appears, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Looking for apps from your computer
After you have the iTunes App Store on your screen, you have a couple of 
options for exploring its virtual aisles. Allow us to introduce you to the vari-
ous “departments” available from the main screen.
Browsing the App Store screen
The main departments are featured in the middle of the screen, and ancillary 
departments appear on either side of them. We start with the ones in the 
middle:
 
✓ The New and Noteworthy department has eight visible icons 
(Transformers: Alliance to A Bugs Defense in Figure 14-1) representing 
apps that are — what else? — new.
 
 Only eight icons are visible, but the New and Noteworthy department 
actually has more than that. Look to the right end of the title bar for 
each department shown down the center section of the screen. Notice 
the little arrow inside a circle and the words See All? Click the See All 

209
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out about iPhone Apps)
link to show all apps in that department on a single screen. Or, you can 
click the little arrow inside a circle on the left or right edge of the depart-
ments to see another screen full (eight more apps in the case of the 
New and Noteworthy department) of icons. Finally, the little dots in the 
middle of the title bar for each department tell you how many screens 
that department contains (a total of four in the case of the New and 
Noteworthy department).
 
✓ The What’s Hot department features eight icons (F.A.S.T. — Fleet Air 
Superiority Training to OmniFocus in Figure 14-1) representing apps that 
are popular with other iPhone users.
 
✓ The Staff Favorites department shows eight icons of apps that are 
highly recommended by the iTunes Store staff. (You can see only the 
first four — Evernote to Real Tennis 2009 — in Figure 14-1.)

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
Apple has a habit of redecorating the iTunes Stores every so often, so allow 
us to apologize in advance if things don’t look or act exactly as described 
here.
You also see display ads for six featured apps between the New and 
Noteworth department and the What’s Hot department (Sonifi to My Brute 
for iPhone).
The little dots in the middle of the title bars of these departments — four dots 
for the New and Noteworthy, What’s Hot, and Staff Favorites departments — 
tell you how many screens of additional apps are available. The little arrows on 
the left and right sides of the departments let you navigate to these additional 
screens.
Two other departments appear to the right of the main ones: Top Paid Apps 
and, one of our favorite departments, Top Free Apps. The number-one app 
displays both its icon and its name; the next nine apps show text links only.
Finally, to the left of the main departments is a special navigation department 
known as Categories, with text links to describe each one. Click these links to 
see the available apps that fit each category description.
Using the Search field
Browsing the screen is helpful, but if you know exactly what you’re looking 
for, we have good news and bad news. The good news is that there’s a faster 
way: Just type a word or phrase into the Search iTunes Store field in the 
upper-right corner of the main iTunes window, as shown in Figure 14-2, and 
then press Enter or Return to initiate the search.
The bad news is that you have to search the entire iTunes Store, which 
includes music, television shows, movies, and other stuff in addition to 
iPhone apps.
Ah, but we have more good news: Your search results are segregated into 
categories — one of which is Applications (see Figure 14-2). And, here’s 
even more good news: If you click the See All link at the right end of the 
Applications category’s title bar, all iPhone applications that match your 
search word or phrase appear.
Getting more information about an app
Now that you know how to find apps in the App Store, this section delves a 
little deeper and shows you how to find out more about an application that 
interests you.

Checking out the detail screen from your computer
To find out more about an application icon, a featured app, or a text link on 
any of the iTunes App Store screens, just click it. A detail screen like the one 
shown in Figure 14-3 appears.
This screen should tell you most of what you need to know about the applica-
tion, such as basic product information and a narrative description, what’s 
new in this version, the language it’s presented in, and the system require-
ments to run the app.
 
Bear in mind that the application description on this screen was written 
by the application’s developer and may be somewhat biased. Never fear, 
gentle reader: In the next section, we show you how to find reviews of the 
application — written by people who have used it.

212

Figure 14-3: The detail screen for Tap Tap Revenge, a nifty little free game (similar to Guitar 
 
Hero) for your iPhone.
Notice that this application is rated 4+, as you can see below the Get App 
button, near the top of the screen shown in Figure 14-3. The rating means 
that this app contains no objectionable material. Here are the other possible 
ratings:
 
✓ 9+: May contain mild or infrequent occurrences of cartoon, fantasy, or 
realistic violence; or infrequent or mild mature, suggestive, or horror-
themed content that may not be suitable for children under the age of 9.
 
✓ 12+: May contain infrequent mild language; frequent or intense cartoon, 
fantasy, or realistic violence; mild or infrequent mature or suggestive 
themes; or simulated gambling that may not be suitable for children 
under the age of 12.
 
✓ 17+: May contain frequent and intense offensive language; frequent and 
intense cartoon, fantasy, or realistic violence; mature, frequent, and 
intense mature, suggestive, or horror-themed content; sexual content; 
nudity; depictions of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs that may not be suitable 
for children under the age of 17. You must be at least 17 years old to 
purchase games with this rating.
One other feature of the detail pages that’s worth mentioning is the collection 
of useful links below the application description. You can’t see them in Figure 
14-3, but the links include Tapulous Web Site, Tap Tap Revenge Support, All 
Applications By Tapulous, Tell a Friend, and others. We urge you to explore 
these links at your leisure.

213
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out about iPhone Apps)
Reading reviews from your computer
If you scroll down the detail screen, near the bottom you find a series of 
reviews by the app’s users. (You can’t see these reviews in Figure 14-3.) 
Each review includes a star rating, from zero to five. If an app is rated four or 
higher, the application is probably well liked by people who own it.
If you could scroll down the screen shown in Figure 14-3, you’d see that this 
application has an average rating of 31/2 stars based on 1,233 user reviews. 
You’d also see three or four recent reviews with their star ratings. And, if you 
care to read even more reviews, you can click the appropriate link below the 
recent reviews.
Downloading an app
This part is simple. When you find an application you want to try, just click 
its Get App or Buy App button. At that point, you have to log in to your 
iTunes Store account, even if the application is free.
After you log in, the application begins downloading. When it’s finished, the 
app appears in the Applications section of your iTunes Library, as shown in 
Figure 14-4.
 
 
Figure 14-4: Applications you downloaded appear in the 
 
Applications section of your iTunes Library.
 
Downloading an application to your iTunes Library is only the first half of get-
ting it onto your iPhone. After you download an app, you have to sync your 
iPhone before the application will be available on it.

214
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Updating an app
Every so often, the developer of an iPhone application releases an update. 
Sometimes these updates add new features to the application, sometimes 
they squash bugs, and sometimes they do both. In any event, updates are 
usually a good thing for you and your iPhone, so it makes sense to check for 
them every so often. To do this using iTunes, click the Check for Updates link 
near the lower-right corner of the Applications screen. Note that if updates 
are available, as shown in Figure 14-4, the link says Updates Available rather 
than Check for Updates.
 
If you click the Get More Applications link next to the Check for Updates link, 
you find yourself back at the main screen of the iTunes App Store (refer to 
Figure 14-1).
Using Your iPhone to Find Apps
Finding apps with your iPhone is almost as easy as finding them by using 
iTunes. The only requirement is that you have an Internet connection of 
some sort — Wi-Fi or wireless data network — to browse, search, download, 
and install apps.
 
 To get started, tap the App Store icon on your iPhone’s Home screen. After 
you launch the App Store, you see five icons at the bottom of the screen, rep-
resenting five ways to interact with the store, as shown in Figure 14-5.
Looking for apps from your iPhone
The first three icons at the bottom of the screen — Featured, Categories, and 
Top 25 — offer three ways to browse the virtual shelves of the App Store.
Browsing the iPhone App Store
The Featured section has two tabs at the top of the screen: New (see Figure 
14-5) and What’s Hot. These two tabs represent two different pages full of 
apps.
The Top 25 section works the same way. Its two tabs — Top Paid and Top 
Free — represent pages of popular apps that either cost money (paid) or 
don’t (free).
 
Each page displays roughly 20 to 25 apps, but you see only four or five at a 
time on the screen. Remember to flick up or down if you want to see the 
others.

215
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out about iPhone Apps)
 
 
Figure 14-5: The icons across the 
 
bottom represent the five sections 
 
of the App Store.
The Categories section works a little differently: It has no tabs, and its main 
page contains no apps. Instead, it offers a list of categories such as Books, 
Games, Lifestyle, and Utilities. Tap a category to see a page full of apps of 
that type.
Using the Search icon
If you know exactly what you’re looking for, rather than simply browse, you 
can tap the Search icon and type a word or phrase.
Finding more information about 
a particular application
Now that you know how to find apps in the App Store, the following sections 
show you how to find out more about a particular application.
Checking out the detail screen from your iPhone
To learn more about any application on any page, tap it to see a detail screen 
like the one shown in Figure 14-6.

216
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
Remember that the application description on this screen was written by the 
developer and may be somewhat biased.
Reading reviews from your iPhone
Scroll down to the bottom of any detail screen, and you find a star rating for 
that application. It’s also the link to that application’s reviews; tap it to see a 
page full of them. At the bottom of that page is another link: More Reviews. 
Tap it to see (what else?) more reviews.
Downloading an app
To download an application to your iPhone, tap the price button near the top 
of its detail screen. In Figure 14-6, it’s the blue thing that says Free. You may 
or may not be asked to type your iTunes Store account password before the 
App Store disappears and the Home screen page opens, where the new appli-
cation’s icon resides. The new icon appears, slightly dimmed, with the word 
Loading beneath it and a blue progress indicator near its bottom, as shown in 
Figure 14-7.
By the way, if the app happens to be rated 17+, you see a warning screen 
after you type your password. You have to click the OK button to confirm 
that you’re over 17 before the app downloads.

indicates that it’s about one-third done.

217
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out about iPhone Apps)
 
The application is now on your iPhone, but it isn’t copied to your iTunes 
library on your Mac or PC until your next sync. If your iPhone suddenly loses 
its memory (unlikely) or if you delete the application from your iPhone 
before you sync (as described later in this chapter), that application is gone 
forever.
After you download an app to your iPhone, the next time you sync your 
phone, the application is transferred to your iTunes Applications library.
 
If an application is less than 10MB, you can download it directly to the iPhone 
over the 3G cellular network or Wi-Fi. Larger programs require Wi-Fi or 
require you to sync up through iTunes on your PC or Mac.
Updating an app
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, every so often the developer of an 
iPhone application releases an update. If one of these is waiting for you, a 
little number in a circle appears on the Updates icon at the bottom of the 
screen. (That number happens to be 2 in Figures 14-5 and 14-6.) Tap the 
Updates icon if any of your apps needs updating.
If you tap the Updates button and see (in the middle of the screen) a mes-
sage that says, “All Apps are Up-to-Date,” none of the apps on your iPhone 
requires an update at this time. If apps need updating, they appear with 
Update buttons next to them. Tap the button to update the application. If 
more than one application needs updating, you can update them all at once 
by tapping the Update All button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
If you try to update an application purchased from another iTunes Store 
account, you’re prompted for that account’s ID and password. If you can’t 
provide them, you can’t download the update.
Working with Applications
That’s almost everything you need to know about installing third-party appli-
cations on your iPhone. However, you might find it helpful to know how to 
delete, review, or report a problem with an app.
Deleting an app
You can delete an application in two ways: In iTunes on your computer or 
directly from your iPhone.

218
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
To delete an application in iTunes, click Applications in the source list and 
then do one of the following:
 
✓ Click the application’s icon to select it and then choose Edit➪Delete.
 
✓ Right-click (or Control+click on a Mac) the application’s icon and choose 
Delete.
Either way, you see a dialog box asking whether you’re sure you want to 
remove the selected application. If you click the Remove button, the applica-
tion is removed from your iTunes library, as well as from any iPhone that 
syncs with your iTunes library.
Here’s how to delete an application on your iPhone:
 
1. Press and hold any icon until all the icons begin to “wiggle.”
 
2. Tap the little x in the upper-left corner of the application you want to 
delete, as shown in Figure 14-8.
 
 A dialog box appears, informing you that deleting this application also 
deletes all its data.
 
3. Tap the Delete button.
 
Little x
 
Figure 14-8: Tap an application’s little 
 
x, and then tap Delete to remove the 
 
app from your iPhone.

219
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out about iPhone Apps)
 
Deleting an app from your iPhone this way doesn’t get rid of it permanently. 
It remains in your iTunes library until you delete it from iTunes, as described 
earlier in this chapter. Put another way: Even though you deleted the applica-
tion from your iPhone, it’s still in your iTunes library. If you want to get rid of 
an application for good and for always after you delete it on your iPhone, you 
must also delete it from your iTunes library.
Writing an app review
Sometimes you love or hate an application so much that you want to tell the 
world about it. In that case, you should write a review. You can do this in two 
ways: In iTunes on your computer or directly from your iPhone.
To write a review using iTunes, follow these steps:
 
1. Navigate to the detail page for the application in the iTunes App Store.
 
2. Scroll down the page to the Reviews section and click the Write a 
Review link.
 
 You may or may not have to type your iTunes store password at this 
point.
 
3. Click the button for the star rating (1 to 5) you want to give the 
application.
 
4. In the Title field, type a title for your review.
 
5. In the Review field, type your review.
 
6. Click the Preview button when you’re finished.
The Preview screen appears. If the review looks good to you, click the Submit 
button. If you want to add something or edit it, click the Edit button. If you 
decide not to review the app after all, click the Cancel button.
To write a review from your iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the App Store icon to launch the App Store.
 
2. Navigate to the detail screen for the application.
 
3. Scroll down the page to the star rating item and tap it.
 
4. Tap the Write a Review button near the top of the Reviews screen.
 
 You may or may not have to type your iTunes store password at this 
point.
 
5. Tap one to five of the dots at the top of the Submit Review screen to 
rate the application.

220
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
6. In the Title field, type a title for your review.
 
7. In the Review field, type your review.
 
8. Tap the Send button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Whichever way you submit your review, Apple reviews your submission. As 
long as it doesn’t violate the (unpublished) rules of conduct for app reviews, 
it appears in a day or two in the App Store, in the Reviews section for the par-
ticular application.
Reporting a problem
Every so often, you find an app that’s recalcitrant — a dud that doesn’t work 
properly or else crashes, freezes, or otherwise messes up your iPhone. When 
this happens, you should definitely report the problem so that Apple and the 
developer know about the problem and (hopefully) can fix it.
If you try to report a problem using iTunes on your computer, you click a 
number of times, only to end up at a Web page that says, “If you are having 
issues with your application, report the issue directly to the developer of the 
app by visiting the developer’s website.” Don’t bother.
You can, however, report a problem from your iPhone. Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the App Store icon to launch the App Store.
 
2. Navigate to the detail screen for the application.
 
3. Scroll down the page and tap the Report a Problem button.
 
 You may or may not have to type your iTunes store password at this 
point.
 
4. Tap one of the three buttons to identify the type of problem you’re 
reporting: This Application Has a Bug, This Application Is Offensive, 
or My Concern Is Not Listed Here.
 
5. Type your report in the Comments field.
 
6. Tap the Report button in the upper-right corner of the screen to 
submit the report.
There you have it — you now know everything you need to know to find, 
install, delete, review, and report problems with iPhone applications!
As Steve Jobs is so fond of saying in his keynotes, there is one last thing: In a 
few pages (Chapters 16 and 17, to be precise), to kick off the famous Part of

When Good iPhones Go Bad
In This Chapter
▶ Fixing iPhone issues
▶ Dealing with network and calling problems
▶ Eliminating that sinking feeling when you can’t sync
▶ Perusing the Apple Web site and discussion forums
▶ Sending your iPhone to an Apple Store
I
n our experience, iPhones are usually reliable devices. And, most users 
we’ve talked to report trouble-free operation. Notice our use of the word 
most. That’s because every so often, a good iPhone goes bad. It’s not a 
common occurrence, but it does happen. So in this chapter, we look at the 
types of bad things that can happen, along with suggestions for fixing 
them.
What kind of bad things are we talking about? Well, we’re 
referring to problems involving
 
✓ The phone itself
 
✓ Making or receiving calls
 
✓ Wireless networks
 
✓ Synchronization, computers (both Mac and 
PC), or iTunes
After all the troubleshooting, we tell you how to get 
even more help if nothing we suggest does the trick. 
Finally, if your iPhone is so badly hosed that it needs to 
go back to the mother ship for repairs, we offer ways to sur-
vive the experience with a minimum of stress or fuss.

222
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
iPhone Issues
Our first category of troubleshooting techniques applies to an iPhone that’s 
frozen or otherwise acting up. The recommended procedure when this hap-
pens is to perform the six Rs in sequence:
 
✓ Recharge
 
✓ Restart
 
✓ Reset your iPhone
 
✓ Remove your content
 
✓ Reset settings and content
 
✓ Restore
If your iPhone acts up on you — if it freezes, doesn’t wake up from sleep, 
doesn’t do something it used to do, or in any other way acts improperly — 
don’t panic; this section describes the things you should try, in the order 
that we (and Apple) recommend.
If the first technique doesn’t do the trick, go on to the second. If the second 
one doesn’t work, try the third. And so on.
Recharge
If your iPhone acts up in any way, shape, or form, the first thing you should 
try is to give its battery a full recharge.
 
Don’t plug the iPhone’s dock connector–to–USB cable into a USB port on your 
keyboard, monitor, or USB hub. You need to plug it into one of the USB ports 
on your computer itself. That’s because the USB ports on your computer 
supply more power than the other ports.
You can use the included USB power adapter to recharge your iPhone from 
an AC outlet rather than from a computer.
Restart
If you recharge your iPhone and it still misbehaves, the next thing to try is 
restarting it. Just as restarting a computer often fixes problems, restarting 
your iPhone sometimes works wonders.
Here’s how to restart:
 
1. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button.
 
2. Slide the red slider to turn off the iPhone, and then wait a few seconds.

223
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
 
3. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again until the Apple logo 
appears on the screen.
 
4. If your first-generation iPhone or iPhone 3G is still frozen, misbehaves, 
or doesn’t start, press and hold the Home button for 6 to 10 seconds 
to force any frozen applications to quit, and then perform Steps 1 
to 3 again. If you have an iPhone 3GS, press and hold the Sleep/Wake 
button until the red Slide to Power Off button appears, then release 
the Sleep/Wake button, and then press and hold the Home button.
If these don’t get your iPhone back up and running, move on to the third R, 
resetting your iPhone.
Reset your iPhone
To reset your iPhone, merely press and hold the Sleep/Wake button, and 
then press and hold the Home button on the front. When you see the Apple 
logo, release both buttons.
Resetting your iPhone is like forcing your computer to restart after a crash. 
Your data shouldn’t be affected by a reset — and in many cases it cures 
whatever was ailing your iPhone. So don’t be shy about giving this technique 
a try. In many cases, your iPhone goes back to normal after you reset it 
this way.
 
Remember to press and hold the Sleep/Wake button before you begin to 
press and hold the Home button. If you press both at the same time, you 
create a screen shot — a picture of whatever is on your screen at the time — 
rather than reset your iPhone. (This type of screen picture, by the way, is 
stored in the Photos app’s Camera Roll. Find out more about this feature at 
the end of Chapter 18.)
Unfortunately, sometimes resetting doesn’t do the trick. When that’s the case, 
you have to take stronger measures.
Remove content
If you’ve been reading along in this chapter, nothing you’ve done should have 
taken more than a minute or two. We hate to tell you, but that’s about to 
change because the next thing you should try is removing some or all of your 
data, to see whether it’s the cause of your troubles.
To do so, you need to sync your iPhone and reconfigure it so that some or 
all of your files are not synchronized (which removes them from the phone). 
The problem could be contacts, calendar data, songs, photos, videos, or 

224
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
podcasts. If you suspect a particular data type — for example, you suspect 
your photos because whenever you tap the Photos icon on the Home screen, 
your iPhone freezes — try removing that data first.
Or, if you have no suspicions, uncheck every item and then sync. When 
you’re finished, your iPhone should have no data on it.
If that method fixed it, try restoring your data, one type at a time. If the prob-
lem returns, you have to keep experimenting to determine which particular 
data type or file is causing the problem.
If you’re still having problems, the next step is to reset your iPhone’s 
settings.
Reset settings and content
Resetting involves two steps: The first one, resetting your iPhone settings, 
resets every iPhone setting to its default — the way it was when you took it 
out of the box. Resetting the iPhone’s settings doesn’t erase any of your data 
or media. The only downside is that you may have to go back and change 
some settings afterward — so you can try this step without trepidation. To 
do it, tap the Settings icon on your Home screen, and then tap General, Reset, 
and Reset All Settings.
 
Be careful not to tap Erase All Content and Settings, at least not yet. Erasing 
all content takes more time to recover from (because your next sync takes a 
long time), so try Reset All Settings first.
Now, if resetting all settings didn’t cure your iPhone, you have to try Erase All 
Content and Settings. You find it in the same place as Reset All Settings (tap 
Settings, General, Reset).
 
This strategy deletes everything from your iPhone — all your data, media, 
and settings. Because all these items are stored on your computer — at least 
in theory — you should be able to put things back the way they were during 
your next sync. But you lose any photos you’ve taken, as well as contacts, 
calendar events, and On-the-Go playlists you’ve created or modified since 
your last sync.
After using Erase All Content and Settings, check to see whether your iPhone 
works properly. If it doesn’t cure what ails your iPhone, the final R, restoring 
your iPhone using iTunes, can help.

225
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
Restore
Before you give up the ghost on your poor, sick iPhone, you can try one more 
thing. Connect your iPhone to your computer as though you were about to 
sync. But when the iPhone appears in the iTunes source list, click the Restore 
button on the Summary tab. This action erases all your data and media and 
resets all your settings.
 
Because all your data and media still exist on your computer (except for 
photos you’ve taken, contacts, calendar events, notes, and On-the-Go play-
lists you’ve created or modified since your last sync, as noted previously), 
you shouldn’t lose anything by restoring. Your next sync will take longer than 
usual, and you may have to reset settings you’ve changed since you got your 
iPhone. But other than those inconveniences, restoring shouldn’t cause you 
any additional trouble.
Okay. So that’s the gamut of things you can do when your iPhone acts up. If 
you tried all this and none of it worked, skim through the rest of this chapter 
to see whether anything else we recommend looks like it might help. If not, 
your iPhone probably needs to go into the shop for repairs.
 
Never fear, gentle reader. Be sure to read the last section in this chapter, “If 
Nothing We Suggest Works.” Your iPhone may be quite sick, but we help ease 
the pain by sharing some tips on how to minimize the discomfort.
Problems with Calling or Networks
If you’re having problems making or receiving calls, problems sending or 
receiving SMS text messages, or problems with Wi-Fi or your wireless car-
rier’s data network, this section may help. The techniques here are short and 
sweet — except for the last one, restore. Restore, which we describe in the 
preceding section, is still inconvenient and time consuming, and it still entails 
erasing all your data and media and then restoring it.
First, here are some simple steps that may help. Once again, we suggest that 
you try them in this order (and so does Apple).
 
1. Check the cell signal icon in the upper-left corner of the screen.
 
 If you don’t have at least one or two bars, you may not be able to use the 
phone or messaging function.
 
2. Make sure you haven’t left your iPhone in airplane mode, as 
described in Chapter 13.

226
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
 In airplane mode, all network-dependent features are disabled, so you 
can’t make or receive phone calls, send or receive messages, or use any 
of the applications that require a Wi-Fi or data network connection (that 
is, Mail, Safari, Stocks, Maps, and Weather).
 
3. Try moving around.
 
 Changing your location by as little as a few feet can sometimes mean the 
difference between four bars and zero bars or being able to use a Wi-Fi 
or wireless data network or not. If you’re inside, try going outside. If 
you’re outside, try moving 10 or 20 paces in any direction. Keep an eye 
on the cell signal or Wi-Fi icon as you move around, and stop when you 
see more bars than you saw before.
 
4. Turn on airplane mode by tapping Settings on the Home screen, and 
then tapping the Airplane mode On/Off switch to turn it on. Wait 15 
or 20 seconds, and then turn it off again.
 
 Toggling airplane mode on and off like this resets both the Wi-Fi and 
wireless data-network connections. If your network connection was the 
problem, toggling airplane mode on and off may correct it.
 
5. Restart your iPhone.
 
 If you’ve forgotten how, refer to the “Restart” section, a few pages back. 
As we mention, restarting your iPhone is often all it takes to fix whatever 
was wrong.
 
6. Make sure your SIM card is firmly seated.
 
 A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a removable smart card used 
to identify mobile phones. Users can change phones by moving the SIM 
card from one phone to another.
 
 To remove the SIM card, use the included SIM-eject tool (if you have an 
iPhone 3G or 3GS), or find a fine-gauge paper clip and straighten one 
end, and then stick the straight end gently into the hole on the SIM tray, 
as shown in Figure 15-1.
 
 When the SIM tray slides out, carefully lift out the SIM card and then 
reinsert it, making sure it’s firmly situated in the tray before you gently 
push the tray back in until it locks.
If none of the preceding suggestions fixes your network issues, try restoring 
your iPhone as described previously, in the “Restore” section.
 
Performing a restore deletes everything on your iPhone — all of your data, 
media, and settings. You should be able to put things back the way they were 
with your next sync. If that doesn’t happen, for whatever reason, you can’t 
say we didn’t warn you.

Sync, Computer, or iTunes Issues
The last category of troubleshooting techniques in this chapter applies to 
issues that involve synchronization and computer-iPhone relations. If you’re 
having problems syncing or your computer doesn’t recognize your iPhone 
when you connect it, here are some things to try.
Once again, we suggest that you try these procedures in the order they’re 
presented here.
 
1. Recharge your iPhone.
 
 If you didn’t try it previously, try it now. Go back to the “iPhone Issues” 
section, at the beginning of this chapter, and read what we say about 
recharging your iPhone. Every word there also applies here.
 
2. Try a different USB port or a different cable if you have one available.

228
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
 It doesn’t happen often, but occasionally USB ports and cables go bad. 
When they do, they invariably cause sync and connection problems. 
Always make sure that a bad USB port or cable isn’t to blame.
 
 If you don’t remember what we said about using USB ports on your com-
puter rather than the ones on your keyboard, monitor, or hub, we sug-
gest that you reread the “Recharge” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
3. Restart your iPhone and try to sync again.
 
 We describe restarting in full and loving detail in the “Restart” section, 
earlier in this chapter.
 
4. Reinstall iTunes.
 
 Even if you have an iTunes installer handy, you probably should visit 
the Apple Web site and download the latest-and-greatest version, just in 
case. You’ll always find the latest version of iTunes at www.apple.com/
itunes/download.
More Help on the Apple Web Site
If you try everything we suggest earlier in this chapter and still have prob-
lems, don’t give up just yet. This section describes a few more places you 
may find helpful. We recommend that you check out some or all of them 
before you throw in the towel and smash your iPhone into tiny little pieces 
(or ship it back to Apple for repairs, as described in the next section).
First, Apple offers an excellent set of support resources on its Web site at 
www.apple.com/support/iphone. You can browse support issues by cat-
egory, search for a problem by keyword, or use the iPhone Troubleshooting 
Assistant to resolve common problems, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
We don’t advise putting a lot of hope in the Troubleshooting Assistant. If you 
tried everything we suggest in this chapter, you probably also tried every-
thing that the Troubleshooting Assistant suggests. However, because it’s 
easier to update a Web site than it is to update a book, the Troubleshooting 
Assistant could offer techniques that we didn’t know about when writing this 
book. So, although it may just repeat things you already know, it could also 
have something new. Give it a try.
While you’re visiting the Apple support pages, another section could be help-
ful: the discussion forums. You find them at http://discussions.apple.
com, and they’re chock-full of questions and answers from other iPhone 
users. Our experience has been that if you can’t find an answer to a support 
question elsewhere, you can often find something helpful in these forums. 
You can browse by category (Integrating iPhone into your Digital Life, for 
example, shown in Figure 15-3) or search by keyword.

229
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
 
Troubleshooting Assistant link
 
Figure 15-2: The Apple iPhone support pages offer several kinds of helpful information.
Either way, you find thousands of discussions about almost every aspect of 
using your iPhone. Better still, frequently you can find the answer to your 
question or a helpful suggestion.
Now for the best part: If you can’t find a solution by browsing or searching, 
you can post your question in the appropriate Apple discussion forum. Check 
back in a few days (or even in a few hours) and some helpful iPhone user 
may well have replied with the answer. If you’ve never tried this fabulous 
tool, you’re missing out on one of the greatest support resources available 
anywhere.
Last, but certainly not least, before you give up the ghost, you might want to 
try a carefully worded Google search. It couldn’t hurt, and you might just find 
the solution you spent hours searching for.

your digital life.
If Nothing We Suggest Helps
If you tried every trick in the book (this one) and still have a malfunctioning 
iPhone, it’s time to consider shipping it off to the iPhone hospital (better 
known as Apple, Inc.). The repair is free if your iPhone is still under its one-
year limited warranty.
 
You can extend your warranty as long as two years from the original purchase 
date, if you want. To do so, you need to buy the AppleCare Protection Plan for 
your iPhone. You don’t have to do it when you buy the phone, but you must 
buy it before your one-year limited warranty expires. The cost is $69.

231
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
Here are a few things you should know before you take your phone in to be 
repaired:
 
✓ Your iPhone is erased during its repair, so you should sync your iPhone 
with iTunes before you take it in, if you can. If you can’t and you entered 
data on the phone since your last sync, such as a contact or an appoint-
ment, the data won’t be there when you restore your iPhone upon its 
return.
 
✓ Remove any third-party accessories, such as a case or screen protector.
 
✓ Remove the SIM card from your iPhone (as described in the earlier sec-
tion “Problems with Calling or Networks”) and keep it in a safe place.
 
 Do not, under any circumstances, forget this step. Apple doesn’t guarantee 
that your SIM card will be returned to you after a repair. If you forget 
this step, Apple suggests that you contact your local AT&T store and 
obtain a new SIM card with the proper account information. Ouch.
Although you may be able to get your iPhone serviced by AT&T or by mail, 
we recommend that you take it to your nearest Apple Store, for two reasons:
 
✓ No one knows your iPhone like Apple. One of the geniuses at the Apple 
Store may be able to fix whatever is wrong without sending your iPhone 
away for repairs.
 
✓ Only the Apple Store offers an Advance Replacement Service (ARS) 
for iPhones needing repairs. The AppleCare Advance Replacement 
Service costs $29 when your iPhone is under warranty or covered by the 
AppleCare protection plan. This service provides you with a new iPhone 
before you have to send in your old one for service.
 
If your iPhone isn’t under warranty or AppleCare, you can still take advantage 
of the Advance Replacement Service — it costs you a lot more, though. See 
Figure 15-4 for the costs at press time or visit www.apple.com/support/
iphone/service/exchange for current pricing or more information on the 
ARS service.
 
 
Figure 15-4: Prices for Advanced Replacement 
 
Service at press time.

232
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
If you choose the AppleCare Advance Replacement Service, you don’t have 
to activate the new phone and it has the same phone number as the phone 
it replaces. All you need to do is pop your old SIM card into the new phone, 
sync it with iTunes to fill it with the data and media files that were on your 
sick iPhone, and you’re good to go.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

I
t’s written in stone somewhere at Wiley world 
headquarters that we For Dummies authors 
must include a Part of Tens in every single For 
Dummies book we write. It’s a duty we take quite 
seriously. So in this part, you’ll ﬁ nd lists of ten of 
our favorite free and paid applications plucked 
from the iPhone App Store. These include pro-
grams to turn your iPhone into a grocery list, a 
baseball reference, and a capable Internet radio. 
Plus you ﬁ nd a couple of addictive games, and 
even an app to let you control your Mac or PC 
remotely from your iPhone.
We close the show with one of our favorite topics: 
hints, tips, and shortcuts that make life with your 
iPhone even better. Among the ten, you discover 
how to look at the capacity of your newly favored 
device in different ways, ﬁ nd out how to share 
Web pages, and pick up another trick or two on 
using iPhone’s virtual keyboard.

K
iller app is familiar jargon to anyone who has spent 
any time around computers. The term refers to 
an application so sweet or so useful that just about 
everybody wants or must have it.
You could make the argument that the most com-
pelling killer app on the iPhone is the very App 
Store we expound on in Chapter 14. This online 
emporium has an abundance of splendid programs — 
dare we say killer apps in their own right? — many 
of which are free. These cover everything from social 
networking tools to entertainment. Okay, so some 
rotten apples are in the bunch too. But we’re here to 
accentuate the positive.
With that in mind, in this chapter we offer ten of our favorite free 
iPhone apps. In Chapter 17, you see ten iPhone apps that aren’t free but are 
worth every penny.
We’re showing you ours and we encourage you to show us yours. If you 
discover your own killer iPhone apps, by all means, let us know so we can 
check them out.

236
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Shazam
Ever heard a song on the radio or television, in a store, or at a club, and won-
dered what it was called or who was singing it? With the Shazam app, you 
may never wonder again. Just launch Shazam and point your iPhone’s micro-
phone at the source of the music. In a few seconds, the song title and artist’s 
name magically appear on your iPhone screen, as shown in Figure 16-1.
 
 
Figure 16-1: Point your phone at the music (left) and Shazam tells you 
 
the artist, title, and more (right).
In Shazam parlance, that song has been tagged. Now if tagging were all 
Shazam could do, that would surely be enough. But wait, there’s more. After 
Shazam tags a song you can
 
✓ Buy the song at the iTunes store
 
✓ Watch related videos on YouTube
 
✓ Tweet the song on Twitter
 
✓ Read a biography, a discography, or lyrics
 
✓ Take a photo and attach it to the tagged item in Shazam
 
✓ E-mail a tag to a friend
Shazam isn’t great at identifying classical music, jazz, or opera, nor is it adept 
at identifying obscure indie bands. But if you use it primarily to identify pop-
ular music, it rocks (pun intended).

237
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
Shazam is amazing. It has worked for us in noisy airport terminals, crowded 
shopping malls, and even once at a wedding ceremony. Heck, Shazam is so 
good we’d have happily paid a few bucks for it.
Wolfgang’s Concert Vault
Wolfgang’s Concert Vault is an app that provides you with free access to 
the largest collection of concert recordings in the world. Some of our favor-
ites include The Who, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Neil Young, Pink Floyd, 
Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Costello, and David Bowie. And if those 
particular artists don’t appeal to you, you’ll find concert recordings by hun-
dreds upon hundreds of other artists.
What’s cool is that these are exclusive recordings you probably haven’t 
heard before and probably won’t hear elsewhere. They include master 
recordings from the archives of Bill Graham Presents, the King Biscuit Flower 
Hour, and many others.
The Wolfgang’s Concert Vault iPhone app (see Figure 16-2) is simple and 
clean but contains most of the functions found at the associated Web site 
(http://www.wolfgangsvault.com), which is shown in Figure 16-3.
 
 
Figure 16-2: The Wolfgang’s Concert 
 
Vault iPhone app has a simple, clean 
 
interface.

238
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Both applications let you tag a concert as a favorite, create playlists of songs 
culled from different concert recordings, search for songs or artists, and 
listen to complete concert recordings at no charge.
If you love music and want to hear unique live performances of songs you 
know and love, Wolfgang’s Concert Vault is the app for you.
 
 
Figure 16-3: The Wolfgang’s Vault Web site is more graphical but the iPhone app delivers 
 
most of the same free goodies.
Instapaper
Do you ever come across a Web page you’d like to read later, when you have 
the time? Sure, you can bookmark those pages, but wouldn’t it be nice if you 
could somehow save them to your iPhone and read them at your conve-
nience? And wouldn’t it be even nicer if you could read them without Internet 
access, such as when you’re on an airplane?

239
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
We’re happy to inform you that you can if you just download the Instapaper 
iPhone application from Marco Arment. Then, when you’re surfing the Web 
on your Mac, PC, or iPhone and see a page you want to read later, select the 
special Instapaper Read Later bookmarklet. From then on, you can read the 
page whenever you choose with the Instapaper iPhone app.
Figure 16-4 shows the Instapaper app displaying some of the Web pages 
we’ve saved with the Read Later bookmarklet. And Figure 16-5 shows what 
one of the articles looks like when you read it with the Instapaper app.

when we read it in Instapaper on 
 
 
an iPhone.
Instapaper is particularly good for long airplane trips. The week before Bob 
travels he makes a point of grabbing lots of Web pages with his Read Later 
bookmarklet to ensure that he doesn’t run out of good stuff to read during 
his flight.
reQall
reQall is much more than just an iPhone app. It’s a complete and feature-
packed system that captures information that’s important to you and makes 
it easy for you to remember that info at the appropriate time.

240
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The cool part is the unique way reQall works. You speak to the reQall 
application (see Figure 16-6). Then and after a short time, your words are 
converted into text and sent to you by e-mail, text message, or instant mes-
sage (or any combination of those three) as well as saved right in the reQall 
iPhone app (see Figure 16-7).
 
 
 
Figure 16-6: Tap this screen and 
Figure 16-7: Your speech is converted 
 
speak for up to 30 seconds. 
to text and, among other things, 
 
 
displayed in the reQall app.
And reQall’s voice-to-text translations are surprisingly accurate, with better 
than 95 percent accuracy. In fact, the only mistake in the example in Figure 
16-7 is that the person’s name is Chuck, not Truck.
Now that alone would be worth more than the price of admission (which, 
may we remind you, is free), but there’s more: reQall understands certain 
words and can use them to route your reminder to the right place at the 
proper time. For example, it understands dates and times so you can have 
reminders that include a time or a date or both. The reminders show up in all 
the places mentioned previously on the appropriate date and at the appropri-
ate time. reQuall also understands the word buy, and will put reminders that 
use that word on your shopping list. And it understands other words, includ-
ing note, ask, tell, remind, meet, and meeting. And if you care to share remind-
ers with others, you can do that, too.

241
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
We’ve been using reQall for a few months and have seen several free updates 
and upgrades that just keep making it better and better.
How can you not love a free iPhone application/service that is elegant, useful, 
helpful, easy to use, and fun? We recommend reQall without hesitation. In 
fact, we think you’d be crazy not to try it.
Now Playing
We like movies, so we both use the Now Playing app a lot. Feed it your zip 
code, and then browse local theatres by movie, showtime, rating (see Figure 
16-8), or by distance from your current location (see Figure 16-9). Another 
nice feature is the ability to buy tickets to most movies from your iPhone 
with just a few additional taps.

We appreciate that we can read reviews, play movie trailers, and e-mail 
movie listings to others with a single click. We also enjoy the recent addition 
of information and movie trailers for soon-to-be-released films and DVDs.
Other free movie apps are out there, but we like Now Playing best.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Pandora Radio
We’ve long been fans of Pandora on the computer. So we’re practically deliri-
ous that this custom Internet radio service is available gratis on the iPhone.
It works on the iPhone in much the same way it does on a PC or a Mac. You 
type the name of a favorite musician or song title and Pandora creates an 
instant personalized radio station with selections that exemplify the style 
you chose. Figure 16-10 shows some of the eclectic stations we created. 
Tapping QuickMix plays musical selections across all your stations. Tapping 
New Station, at the bottom of the screen, brings up the iPhone keyboard so 
that you can add a new station built around an artist, song title, or composer. 
You can also select from stations Pandora has packaged together around a 
particular genre.
 
 
Figure 16-10: Eclectic online radio 
 
stations from Pandora.
Suppose that you type Beatles. Pandora’s instant Beatles station includes 
performances from John, Paul, George, and Ringo, as well as tunes from other 
acts doing their own hits.
And say you type in a song title, such as Have I Told You Lately. Pandora con-
structs a station with similar music after you tell it whether to base tunes on 
the Van Morrison, Rod Stewart, or other rendition.

243
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
Pandora comes out of the Music Genome Project, an organization of musi-
cians and technologists who analyze music according to hundreds of attri-
butes (such as melody, harmony, and vocal performances).
You can help fine-tune the music Pandora plays by tapping the thumbs-up or 
thumbs-down icon below the album cover of the song being played, as shown 
in Figure 16-11.
 
Tap to return to station list
Tap for explanation of why song is playing and artist info
Tap when you don’t like song being played
Tap to bookmark a song or an artist, 
buy from iTunes, or e-mail station
Tap when you like song being played
Tap to skip to next track
Tap to pause song
Slide to adjust volume
 
Figure 16-11: Have we told you lately how much we like 
 
Pandora?
If you tap the triangular icon, you can bookmark the song or artist being 
played, e-mail the station that the song is playing on, or head to iTunes to 
purchase the song directly on the iPhone (if available).
Amazon Kindle
The folks over at Amazon made a splash with the company’s Kindle elec-
tronic readers. (When it comes to introducing high-profile products, we think 
the folks at Apple know a little something about making a splash too.) But 

244
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
although Ed is a fan of the Kindle reader, even he thinks they’re expensive — 
$359 on up at the time this book was in production.
Kindle for the iPhone, on the other hand, is perfectly free, though of course 
you’re still on the hook for buying electronic versions of books. You can do 
that from a PC or a Mac and wirelessly transfer them to the Kindle app. Or 
within the app, you can tap Get Books, which transports you to Safari on the 
iPhone. And from there you can purchase titles in the online Kindle Store.
E-books for Kindle are deeply discounted compared to their physical coun-
terparts; most new release bestsellers cost just $9.99.
The books you own show up in a list like the one shown in Figure 16-12. Tap 
the title you want to read.
The Kindle app doesn’t have near as large a screen as you’ll find on a dedi-
cated Kindle reader. But the reading experience on the iPhone is surprisingly 
good, plus you can perform such tricks as adjusting the font size and text 
color (black, white, sepia), adding bookmarks, and reading in portrait or 
landscape mode by rotating the device. Controls for customizing your read-
ing are shown in Figure 16-13. And with true iPhone flair, you can pinch to 
zoom in on what you’re reading. The iPhone can even show off Kindle book 
covers in color, which not even the Kindle itself can do.

 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
If you own a Kindle reader, you can switch back and forth between it and the 
iPhone Kindle app, without losing your place in whatever you’re reading, a 
feature Amazon calls Whispersync. Bookmarks and such are synced. And 
that’s downright novel.
Remote
Leave it to Apple to come up with one of the coolest iPhone apps money 
can’t buy (because it’s free). It’s called Remote, and it lets you control music 
playing in iTunes on your computer, Apple TV, or AirPort Express.
With Remote, you can use your iPhone to do almost everything you can do 
in iTunes: Play, pause, skip, shuffle, search, or browse your iTunes library. 
Better yet, you can perform these actions from anywhere in your house that 
has Wi-Fi.
 
Because the interface is almost the same as the iPod application on your 
iPhone, you already know how to use it. (If you need help with the iPod func-
tion on your iPhone, see Chapter 7.)
Remote is free, but it does require a couple of basics: a computer running 
Apple’s iTunes software and a Wi-Fi network.
WhitePages Mobile
Yea, yea, we know: Plenty of phone directories are on the Internet. But 
WhitePages Mobile is an incredibly handy resource for finding home and 
business numbers on the fly or doing a reverse phone lookup (you have the 
number but have no clue whose number it is).
When new listings pop up, you can add them to your contacts or update 
existing contacts. And you can get maps and directions to where folks live or 
work. In some cases, WhitePages Mobile provides other information, includ-
ing the age range of the person and some of the people living in the person’s 
household. And WhitePages uses GPS to detect your current whereabouts.
Skype
You’re probably thinking, “Why in goodness’ sake do you need an app 
that makes phone calls when you’re already carrying a cell phone?” Well, 
Skype calls are routed over the Internet through what geeks refer to as VOIP 
(Voice-over Internet Protocol). And if you frequently call friends, colleagues, 
or relatives who are overseas, you can save money by not paying AT&T’s 

246
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
lofty international rates. As with Skype on a PC or a Mac, direct calls made 
to other Skype members are free, and you can also instant message them. 
Through Skype, you can also call landline or mobile phones in the United 
States and around the world at low rates while not exhausting your monthly 
AT&T allowance.
If a person is in your Skype contacts, just tap his or her name to call and 
begin a chat. You can display all your contacts or only those presently 
online. The app also is integrated with your iPhone contacts; if you tap a 
phone number there, the number is prepopulated in Skype’s on-screen dial 
pad, shown in Figure 16-14.
 
 
Figure 16-14: You can tap out a real 
 
phone number on Skype.
You can also summon the on-screen dial pad while on a call, as well as mute 
or place a call on hold and turn a speakerphone on or off.
 
The biggest drawback to be aware of: You must have access to Wi-Fi to make 
Skype calls. Forbidding Skype calls over the 3G network is a restriction that 
we assume keeps AT&T somewhat satisfied.

f you read Chapter 16, you know that lots of great free 
applications are available for your iPhone. But as 
the old cliché goes, some things are worth paying for. 
Still, none of the ten for-pay apps we’ve chosen as 
some of our favorites are likely to break the bank. 
As you’re about to discover, some of the applica-
tions on this list are practical and some are down-
right silly. The common theme? We think you’ll like 
carrying these apps around on your iPhone.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour ($9.99)
Bob loved Electronic Arts’ Mac version of Tiger Woods PGA 
Tour and played it until his fingers bled. Now we’re enjoying the 
iPhone version almost as much. The graphics and level of detail are 
incredible, as shown in Figure 17-1, and the user interface is among the best 
we’ve seen for an iPhone game. And the touch-and-drag swing meter, shown 
in Figure 17-2, is one of the best touchscreen game controls we’ve tried.

Figure 17-1: The graphics and detail in Tiger Woods PGA Tour are 
 
outstanding.

draw and fade shots.
With your choice of seven world-famous golf courses and top golfers such as 
Annika Sorenstam, Vijay Singh, and, of course, Tiger Woods, along with real-
time play-by-play commentary by Sam Torrance and Kelly Tilghman, you can 
play over and over and over without repetition.

249
 Chapter 17: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
And that’s just what we’ve done. If you like golf or just enjoy a beautifully 
designed iPhone game, Tiger Woods PGA Tour is a bargain at $9.99.
Grocery IQ ($0.99)
Have you ever gone to the supermarket only to discover you left your gro-
cery list at home? The Grocery IQ app from Coupons.com is, plain and simple, 
the shopping list you’ll never leave behind, because — we presume — you’ll 
never leave your iPhone behind. It’s easy to build up a shopping list orga-
nized by category, so as you peruse the aisles of canned goods, say, you’ll 
know when you’re short on soup or peanut butter.
Better still, the Grocery IQ app has a database of 130,000 items (with real 
product brand names), so as you type some letters on the iPhone’s virtual 
keyboard to add new items to your list, Grocery IQ can start suggesting 
potential matches. And when you’ve located the items you need in the store, 
just tap to check them off your list until next time, as shown in Figure 17-3.
We think Grocery IQ is well worth the 99-cent price. Heck, you spend 
more money than that on some impulse item when you check out at the 
supermarket.

loaf of bread.

OldBooth Premium ($0.99)
OldBooth Premium is just plain fun. It lets you take any full-face photo of 
anyone and apply wonderfully goofy transformations to it. Since a picture is 
worth thousands of words, let’s start with Figure 17-4, which clearly demon-
strates just what it is that OldBooth Premium does.
 
 
Figure 17-4: The original photos of Bob and his wife Lisa are on the 
 
far left; the three OldBooth images of each appear to the right of them.
You get the picture, don’t you? (Pun completely intended.)
Using OldBooth Premium is as easy as 1-2-3:
 
1. Choose a gender and then select one of the 20 mask styles available 
for each gender.
 
2. Choose a picture.
 
 You can either take a new photo with your iPhone’s camera or choose a 
picture from your iPhone’s Photo Library.
 
3. Resize the picture by pinching or unpinching, rotate the picture by 
pressing and dragging, and adjust the brightness of either the picture, 
the mask, or both.
 
 When you’re happy with the image, save it to your iPhone’s camera roll, 
where you can use it as wallpaper, e-mail it to a friend, assign it to a con-
tact, or send it to MobileMe. And, of course, it will be exported to your 
Mac or PC the next time you sync.

251
 Chapter 17: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
OldBooth is easy and lots of fun for less than a buck.
 
If even a buck sounds like too much, there’s a free version with only a few 
masks. It’s called just plain OldBooth (without the Premium).
GottaGo ($1.99)
If you’ve ever wanted a perfect excuse to leave a meeting (or anywhere else for 
that matter), you’ll love GottaGo. This clever little app lets you create a bogus 
phone call or text message and have it appear on your iPhone at any time you 
choose. At the appropriate moment, your iPhone rings or chimes and you 
receive what looks and sounds just like a real phone call or text message.
It’s beautifully done and will fool most everyone. The GottaGo unlock screen 
is animated just like the real thing. You can attach an image to your GottaGo 
call so it truly looks like you’re receiving a real phone call. You can record 
custom audio that you hear when you answer the fake call. And you can 
choose your own wallpaper and ringtone to make the effect even more realis-
tic, as shown in Figure 17-5.
 
 
Figure 17-5: GottaGo has a myriad of 
 
settings to make your fake call look 
 
so much like the real thing that even 
 
you might be fooled.

252
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
When you gotta go, nothing gets you out of there faster than the GottaGo 
iPhone app. Yes, it costs two bucks, but isn’t that a tiny price to pay for your 
freedom?
WordsWorth ($1.99)
Being writers ourselves, we love a good word game, and one of our favor-
ites so far is WordsWorth. You form words by tapping letters on the screen. 
Longer words using rarer letters (such as J, Z, and Qu, for example), score 
more points than shorter words with more common letters.
To make things interesting, there are certain special tiles, including blue wild 
cards, green bonuses, and red timers, all shown in Figure 17-6. The timer tiles 
are the most insidious; if their time runs out before you’ve used the letter, 
the game is over.
 
 
Figure 17-6: Blue wild card, red 
 
timer, and green bonus tiles make 
 
WordsWorth a challenge.
WordsWorth doesn’t have a fixed time limit per game. Instead, it’s 
level-based — each time you achieve the prescribed number of points, 
you advance to the next level. And, of course, the levels grow increasingly 
harder with more and rarer timed tiles, fewer vowels, and rarer consonants.

253
 Chapter 17: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
If you can’t find any more words on the screen, you can shuffle the tiles by 
shaking your iPhone. But be careful: A limited number of shuffles are avail-
able for each level.
Although WordsWorth is simple, it’s engaging and addictive. But don’t take 
our word for it. You can try a free version — WordsWorth Lite — before you 
buy the full game. Both games are the same in every way, except the Lite ver-
sion is limited to three levels (versus 20).
We should point out that lots of terrific word-based games are available for 
the iPhone. Another favorite worth checking out is a Boggle-like game called 
Wurdle from Semi Secret Software, which will set you back only $1.99.
Jaadu VNC ($24.99)
We admit that Jaadu VNC isn’t cheap and is more than a little geeky, but it’s 
so cool and potentially useful that we would have been remiss had we not 
included it.
Jaadu VNC (Virtual Network Computing, also known as remote screen con-
trol) is an iPhone app for controlling your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer, 
“from a few feet away or from halfway around the world.”
Yes, you can actually see your computer screen and control its keyboard and 
mouse from anywhere in the world (as long as your iPhone can connect to 
the Internet through Wi-Fi, 3G, Edge, or whatever).
Figure 17-7 shows an iPhone running Jaadu VNC, which is controlling a Mac 
in another room (though it could just as easily be in a different city, state, or 
country).
Jaadu VNC is an iPhone app, so you pinch and unpinch to zoom in and out. In 
Figure 17-7, we zoomed in on the upper-left corner of the Mac screen, where 
this very chapter is being edited in Microsoft Word.
There’s little you can do on your Mac, PC, or Linux computer that you can’t 
control remotely with Jaadu VNC — though of course you’re dealing with 
a smaller screen on the iPhone. We use Jaadu VNC to check mail accounts 
other than the ones on our iPhones, to grab files from our hard drive and 
e-mail them to ourselves (at our iPhone e-mail addresses) or others, and to 
make sure backups are running when scheduled.

Another cool use for the application is as a “spy cam.” This feature requires 
a computer with a built-in camera, such as a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Just 
open an app that uses the camera (for example, Photo Booth on the Mac or 
a Webcam program under Windows), and you’ll be able to watch what’s hap-
pening in your office remotely on your iPhone.
Several free or less expensive VNC apps are available in the iTunes Store, but 
Jaadu VNC is the only one we’ve found that is robust and reliable enough to 
recommend.
Baseball Statistics 2009 Edition ($2.99)
Consider Baseball Statistics 2009 Edition a dream app for a passionate base-
ball fan. One of the things that makes baseball such a great game is the sta-
tistics that have defined the sport since, well, the 19th century. (We won’t 
add a steroids comment — oops, just did.) Baseball Statistics from Bulbous 
Ventures puts all those stats at your fingertips, so you can settle barroom 
bets or just relive memories of favorite ballplayers from when you were a kid.
The app has easily accessible yearly stats for every Major League player and 
team since 1871 — nope, we weren’t around — from batting, fielding, and 
pitching statistics to team wins, losses, and attendance.

255
 Chapter 17: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
You could look up the stats for outfielder Cherokee Fisher of the 1872 
Baltimore Canaries. (Check out Figure 17-8 for evidence that the Canaries 
existed.) Or see how Mickey Mantle’s career stats compared to Willie Mays’s.
About the only bad thing we can say about Baseball Statistics (which used 
to be called just Baseball) is that the app was once free. But Ed, a passionate 
New York Mets junkie, would gladly spring for the $2.99 tab. Heck, that sum 
would have bought an awfully good seat at the ballpark when Tom Seaver 
was pitching brilliantly for the 1969 Miracle Mets. His stats from that season 
are shown in Figure 17-9.

of 1969.
Ocarina ($0.99)
Almost overnight, Ocarina, Smule’s addictive app, became one of the most 
popular in the App Store. It can transform your iPhone into an ancient flute-
light instrument. You gently blow into the iPhone’s microphone and play 
notes by pressing and holding your fingers over any of four virtual on-screen 
holes, shown in Figure 17-10. There are 16 possible combinations.

256
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
At Smule’s Web site, you can learn how to play and even find Ocarina sheet 
music for everything from I’ve Grown Accustomed to Her Face to Yellow 
Submarine.
 
Tap the Globe menu icon (not shown in Figure 17-10) to hear other people 
play around the world. The sound waves depicted in Figure 17-11 are coming 
from the Middle East. You can tap a heart to show other people you think 
highly of their performances, and they in turn can show you the love.

Simplify Music ($3.99)
We know the iPhone is a fabulous iPod, but even if you splurge for the 32GB 
iPhone 3GS, you may run out of storage for all your music. Simplify Music can 
stream digital music stored in your library on a Mac, PC, or Linux computer 
back home, as shown in Figure 17-12. You can even access lyrics and artist 
information. You must download software onto the computer where your 
music resides.

257
 Chapter 17: Ten Apps Worth Paying For
Simplify Music works over a Wi-Fi or a 3G cellular connection. There are 
some limitations, notably the fact that Simplify can’t play songs purchased 
over iTunes that are saddled by digital copyright restrictions.
 
 
Figure 17-12: Some of the songs that 
 
can be streamed from Ed’s Mac at

happens to be.
A $5.99 pro version dubbed Simplify 2 lets you create playlists on the fly and 
search. But if you don’t need those features, we think you’ll be simply satis-
fied with Simplify.
Zagat to Go ’09 ($9.99)
Hey, you have to eat sometime. Zagat to go, the newly updated app from 
Handmark, lets you access the popular Zagat ratings for restaurants, hotels, 
nightspots, and more around the world — there are more than 40,000 listings.

258
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You can search; filter results by food, décor, cost, and service; and read 
Zagat’s famous thumbnail commentaries. Foodies can tap into GPS to find 
decent restaurants when they’re traveling.
The information, like the listing for Nobu in Figure 17-13, is current through 
the 2009 Zagat editions.

Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, 
and Shortcuts
In This Chapter
▶ Typing faster with the slide
▶ Typing faster with autocorrection
▶ Viewing the iPhone’s capacity
▶ Altering the speed of scrubbing in iTunes
▶ Exploiting links
▶ Sharing Web pages

▶ Storing stuff
▶ Creating free ringtones with GarageBand
▶ Capturing a screen grab
A
fter spending a lot of quality time with our 
iPhones, it’s only natural that we’ve discov-
ered more than a few helpful hints, tips, and short-
cuts. In this chapter, we share some of our faves.
Do the Slide for Accuracy 
and Punctuation
Our first tip can help you type faster in two ways. One, it 
helps you type more accurately; two, it lets you type punctuation 
and numerals faster than ever before.

260
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Over the course of this book, you find out how to tap, how to double-tap, and 
even how to double-tap with two fingers. Now we want to introduce you to a 
new gesture we like to call the slide.
To do the slide, you start by performing the first half of a tap. That is, you 
touch your finger to the screen but don’t lift it up. Now, without lifting your 
finger, slide it onto the key you want to type. You’ll know you’re on the right 
key because it pop ups — enlarges.
First, try the slide during normal typing. Stab at a key and if you miss, rather 
than lifting your finger, backspacing, and trying again, do the slide onto the 
proper key. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll see that it saves a lot of time 
and improves your accuracy as well.
Now here’s the best part: You can use the slide to save time with punctuation 
and numerals, too. The next time you need to type a punctuation mark or 
number, try this technique:
 
1. Start a slide action with your finger on the 123 key (the key to the left 
of the Space key when the alphabetical keyboard is active).
 
 This is a slide, not a tap, so don’t lift your finger just yet.
 
2. When the punctuation and numeric keyboard appears on-screen, slide 
your finger onto the punctuation mark or number you want to type.
 
3. Lift your finger.
The cool thing is that the punctuation and numeric keyboard disappears and 
the alphabetical keyboard reappears — all without tapping the 123 key to 
display the punctuation and numeric keyboard and without tapping the ABC 
key (the key to the left of the Space key when the punctuation and numeric 
keyboard is active).
Practice the slide for typing letters, punctuation, and numerals, and we guar-
antee that in a few days you’ll be typing faster and more accurately.
Autocorrect Is Your Friend
Here are two related tips about autocorrection that can also help you type 
faster and more accurately.

261
 Chapter 18: Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
Auto apostrophes are good for you
First, before moving on from the subject of punctuation, you should know 
that you can type dont to get to don’t, and cant to get to can’t. We’ve told you 
to put some faith in the iPhone’s autocorrection software. And that applies 
to contractions. In other words, save time by letting the iPhone’s intelligent 
keyboard insert the apostrophes on your behalf for these and other common 
words.
 
We’re aware of at least one exception. The iPhone cannot distinguish 
between it’s, the contraction of “it is,” and its, the possessive adjective and 
possessive pronoun.
Make rejection work for you
Along those same lines, if the autocorrect suggestion isn’t the word you want, 
instead of ignoring it, reject it. Finish typing the word and then tap the x to 
reject the suggestion before you type another word. Doing so makes your 
iPhone more likely to accept your word the next time you type it and less 
likely to make the same incorrect suggestion again.
Here you thought you were buying a tech book, and you get grammar and 
typing lessons thrown in at no extra charge. Just think of us as full-service 
authors.
Three Ways to View the iPhone’s Capacity
When your iPhone is selected in the source list in iTunes, you see a colorful 
chart at the bottom of the screen that tells you how your iPhone’s capacity is 
being used by your media and other data.
By default, the chart shows the amount of space your audio, video, and 
photo files use on your iPhone in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). But you 
knew that. What you probably don’t know is that when you click the colorful 
chart, it cycles through two more slightly different displays. The first click 
changes the display from the amount of space used to the number of items 
(audio, video, and photos) you have stored. Click once more, and the display 
changes to the total playing time for audio and video, as shown in Figure 18-1.
This is particularly helpful before you go on a trip. Knowing that you have 8.2 
days of audio and 13.7 hours of video is far more useful than knowing how 
many gigabytes you’re packing.

262

Figure 18-1: Click the colorful chart, and what’s stored on your iPhone is 
 
expressed in different ways.
Assault on batteries
Because this is a chapter of tips and hints, we’d 
be remiss if we didn’t include some ways that 
you can extend your battery life. First and fore-
most: If you use a carrying case, charging the 
iPhone while it’s in that case may generate more 
heat than is healthy. Overheating is bad for both 
battery capacity and battery life. So take the 
iPhone out of the case before you charge it.
If you’re not using power-thirsty 3G or Wi-Fi net-
works, or a Bluetooth device (such as a headset 
or car kit), consider turning off the features you 
don’t need in Settings. Doing so could mean the 
difference between running out of juice and being 
able to make that important call later in the day.
Activate Auto-Brightness to enable the screen 
brightness to adjust based on current lighting 
conditions. Using this setting can be easier on 
your battery. Tap Settings on the Home screen, 
tap Brightness, and then tap the On/Off switch, 
if necessary, to turn it on.
Turning off Location Services (tap Settings, tap 
General, and then tap the On/Off switch to turn off 
Location Services) and Push (tap Settings, tap Fetch 
New Data, and then tap the On/Off switch to turn 
off Push) can also help to conserve battery life.
Finally, turning on EQ (see Chapter 7) when you 
listen to music can make it sound better, but 
it also uses more processing power. If you’ve 
added EQ to tracks in iTunes using the Track 
Info window, and you want to retain the EQ 
from iTunes, set the EQ on your iPhone to flat. 
Because you’re not turning off EQ, your battery 
life will be slightly worse but your songs will 
sound just the way you expect them to sound. 
Either way, to alter your EQ settings, tap Settings 
on the Home screen, tap iPod, and then tap EQ.
Apple says a properly maintained iPhone battery 
will retain up to 80 percent of its original capac-
ity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles. 
You can replace the battery at any time if it no 
longer holds sufficient charge. Your one-year 
limited warranty includes the replacement of a 
defective battery. Coverage jumps to two years 
with the AppleCare Protection Plan. Apple will 
replace the battery if it drops below 50 percent 
of its original capacity.
If your iPhone is out of warranty, Apple will 
replace the battery for $79.00 plus $6.95 shipping, 
plus local tax, and will also dispose of your old 
battery in an environmentally friendly manner.

The Way-Cool Hidden iTunes Scrub Speed Tip
Here’s the situation: You’re listening to a podcast or audiobook and trying 
to find the beginning of a specific segment by moving the Scrubber left and 
right. The only problem is that the Scrubber isn’t very precise and your fat 
finger keeps moving it too far one way or the other. Never fear — the iPhone 
OS 3.0 software has a wonderful (albeit somewhat hidden) fix. Just press your 
finger on the Scrubber (that little round dot on the Scrubber bar), but instead 
of sliding your finger to the left or right, slide it downward toward the bottom 
of the screen (see Figure 18-2). As you slide, the scrubbing speed changes 
like magic and the amount of change is displayed above the Scrubber bar. 
The default (normal) speed is called hi-speed scrubbing; when you slide your 
finger downward, the speed changes to half-speed scrubbing, then to quarter-
speed scrubbing, and finally to fine scrubbing.
 
Elapsed time

Remaining time

Figure 18-2: Press on the Scrubber 
 
and slide your finger downward to 
 
change the scrubbing rate.
While you’re sliding, keep an eye on the elapsed time and remaining time indi-
cators because they provide useful feedback on the current scrubbing speed.
This scrub trick is easier to do than to explain, so give it a try.

Tricks with Links and Phone Numbers
The iPhone does something special when it encounters a phone number 
or URL in e-mail and SMS text messages. The iPhone interprets as a phone 
number any sequence of numbers that looks like a phone number: 1-123-
555-4567, 555-4567, 1.123.555.4567, and so on. The same goes for sequences 
of characters that look like a Web address (URL), such as http://www.
WebSiteName.com or www.WebSiteName.com. When the iPhone sees what 
it assumes to be a URL, it appears as a blue link on your screen.
If you tap a phone number or URL sequence like the ones just shown, the 
iPhone does the right thing. It launches the Phone application and dials the 
number for a phone number, or it launches Safari and takes you to the appro-
priate Web page for a URL. That’s useful but somewhat expected. What’s 
more useful and not so expected is the way Safari handles phone numbers 
and URLs.
Let’s start with phone numbers. When you encounter a phone number on a 
Web page, give it a tap. A little dialog box appears on the screen displaying 
that phone number and offering you a choice of two buttons: Call or Cancel. 
Tap Call to switch to the Phone application and dial the number; tap Cancel 
to return to the Web page.
Here’s another cool Safari trick, this time with links. If you press and hold a 
link rather than tapping it, a little floating text bubble appears and shows you 
the underlying URL.
 
You also see the underlying URL if you press and hold on a URL in Mail or 
Text. Having this information in Mail or Text is even more useful because it 
enables you to spot bogus links without switching to Safari or actually visit-
ing the URL.
Finally, here’s one last Safari trick. If you press and hold on most graphic 
images, a Save Image button appears. Tap it and the picture is saved to the 
camera roll in the Photos application.
Share the Love
Ever stumble on a Web page you just have to share with a buddy? The 
iPhone makes it dead simple. From the site in question, tap the + button at 
the bottom of the browser. Then tap the Mail Link to this Page button that 
appears on-screen. A mail message appears with the subject line prepopu-
lated with the name of the Web site you’re visiting, and the body of the mes-
sage prepopulated with the URL. Just type something in the message body 
(or don’t), supply your pal’s e-mail address, and then tap the Send button.

Choosing a Home Page for Safari
You may have noticed that there’s no home page Web site on the iPhone ver-
sion of Safari as there is in the Mac and PC versions of the browser (and for 
that matter every other Web browser we know of). Instead, when you tap the 
Safari icon, you return to the last site you visited.
The trick is to create an icon for the page you want to use as your home page. 
This technique is called creating a Web clip of a Web page. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Open the Web page you want to use as your home page and tap the + 
button.
 
2. Tap the Add to Home Screen button.
 
 An icon that will open this page appears on your Home screen (or one of 
your Home screens if you have more than one).
 
3. Tap this new Web clip icon instead of the Safari icon, and Safari opens 
to your home page instead of to the last page you visited.
 
You can even rearrange the icons so that your home page icon, instead of the 
Safari icon, appears in the dock (the bottom row that appears on every home 
screen), as shown in Figure 18-3. See the tip in Chapter 1 for rearranging 
icons if you’ve forgotten how.

Storing Files
A tiny Massachusetts software company known as Ecamm Network is sell-
ing an inexpensive piece of Mac OS X software that lets you copy files from 
your computer to your iPhone and copy files from the iPhone to a computer. 
(There’s no Windows version.) Better still, you can try the $19.95 program 
called PhoneView for a week before deciding whether you want to buy it. Go 
to www.ecamm.com to fetch the free demo.
In a nutshell, here’s how it works. After downloading the software onto your 
Mac, double-click the program’s icon to start it. To transfer files and fold-
ers to the iPhone (assuming there’s room on the device), click the Copy to 
iPhone button on the toolbar, and then select the files you want to copy. 
The files are copied into the appropriate folder on the iPhone. Alternatively, 
you can drag files and folders from the Mac desktop or a folder into the 
PhoneView browser.
To go the other way and copy files from your iPhone to your computer, high-
light the files or folders you want copied, and click the Copy from iPhone 
button on the toolbar. Select the destination on your Mac where you want 
to store the files, and then click Save. You can also drag files and folders 
from the PhoneView file browser onto the Mac desktop or folder. Or you can 
double-click a file in the PhoneView browser to download it to your Mac’s 
Documents folder.
If you need access to the files on your iPhone, or if you want to use your 
iPhone as a pseudohard disk, PhoneView is a bargain.
Create Ringtones for Free in GarageBand
The ability to create free iPhone ringtones with Apple’s GarageBand applica-
tion (which is bundled with every Mac) was beyond the purview of the ring-
tone discussions in previous chapters. Creating those ringtones, however, 
is relatively easy. Start by launching GarageBand and creating a new Music 
project. Then:
 
1. Click the Media Browser button to reveal the media browser pane.
 
2. Click the disclosure triangle to reveal the contents of your iTunes 
library.
 
3. Click your iTunes music library to reveal its contents.
 
4. Click the song you want to turn into a ringtone and drag it onto the 
timeline (Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah! in Figure 18-4).

Figure 18-4: Creating a custom ringtone, part I.
 
 You can’t use songs purchased from the iTunes store for ringtones if 
they are protected by Apple’s digital rights management copy protec-
tion. GarageBand won’t let you drag a protected song onto its timeline.
 
 Apple stopped using copy protection for music files in April 2009. If you 
purchased the song after that, you’re good to go. If you purchased the 
song before then, you can pay a small upgrade fee (30 cents at press 
time) to convert the song to iTunes Plus, Apple’s new higher-quality, 
non-copy-protected format.
 
 The bottom line is that you can make ringtones only from songs you’ve 
ripped yourself from CD or downloaded without rights management 
or other copy protection (such as MP3s from Amazon.com or files in 
Apple’s iTunes Plus format).
 
5. Click the Cycle Region button to enable the Cycle Region.
 
6. Click in the middle of the Cycle Region and drag it to the portion of 
the song you want to use as your ringtone.

268
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
7. Fine-tune the start and end points by clicking and dragging the Cycle 
Region’s left and right edges, as shown in Figure 18-5.
 
 For best results, keep your ringtones under 30 seconds.
 
8. Click the Play button to hear your work. When you’re satisfied with it, 
choose Share➪Send Ringtone to iTunes.

The next time you sync, your new ringtone becomes available on your 
iPhone. To use it as your ringtone, tap Settings, Sounds, Ringtone, and then 
tap the ringtone in the list of available sounds. To associate the ringtone with 
a specific contact or contacts, find the contact in either the Contacts applica-
tion or the Phone app’s Contacts tab, tap Ringtone, and then tap the ringtone 
in the list of available sounds.

Taking a Snapshot of the Screen
True confession: We threw in this final tip because, well, it helps people 
like us.
Permit us to explain. We hope you’ve admired the pictures of the iPhone 
screens that are sprinkled throughout this book. We also secretly hope that 
you’re thinking what marvelous photographers we must be.
Well, the fact is, we couldn’t take a blurry picture of the iPhone using its 
built-in (and undocumented) screen-grab feature if we wanted to.
Press the Sleep/Wake button at the same time you press the Home button, 
but just for an instant. The iPhone grabs a snapshot of whatever is on the 
screen.
The picture lands in the iPhone’s camera roll; from there, you can synchro-
nize it with your PC or Mac, along with all your other pictures. And from 
there, the possibilities are endless. Why, your picture could wind up just 
about anywhere, including in a For Dummies book.

The iPhone keeps getting better, and this book keeps you in 
tune with the newest features. The basics are here too: how 
to use the multitouch interface, set up iTunes and buy music, 
surf the Web, check and send e-mail and text messages, watch 
movies and TV shows (and YouTube), admire pictures, down-
load apps — and even make phone calls.
•  Stay organized  — synchronize contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, 
and bookmarks between your computer and your iPhone 
•  Do you copy? — copy, cut, and paste text, photos, and videos from 
one application to another
•  Record it — capture a thought, a memo, or a meeting with Voice 
Memos then trim your recording and send it via e-mail or MMS
•  Shake and shuffle your music — create playlists, scroll through your 
music library, and customize your listening experience
•  Find yourself — identify your location via GPS, get turn-by-turn 
directions, find true north with the compass, and search for a 
location
Fill your iPhone with cool stuff, 
ask it to play a song or call a friend,
and find anything with Spotlight
